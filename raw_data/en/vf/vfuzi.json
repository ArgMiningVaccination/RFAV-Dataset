(ii) (iii)(iv)National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims for India to have an education system by 2040 that is second to none. With the quickly changing employment landscape and global ecosystem, it is becoming increasingly critical that children not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn. Education thus, must move towards less content and more towards learning about how to think critically and solve problems, how to be creative and multidisciplinary, and how to innovate, adapt, and absorb new material in novel and changing fields. Pedagogy must evolve to make education more experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible, and, of course, enjoyable (NEP 2020) . In alignment with the NEP, Central Board of Secondary Education has taken quite a few measures to make learning at schools holistic, skill- driven, competency-oriented and joyful. Joyful Learning necessarily imbibes the element of deriving pleasure with a sense of achievement and accomplishment during the process of learning. It enables the learner to improve all 21st century skills. Whether it is Experiential Learning, Art- Integrated Learning, Activity-Based Learning or Project-Based Learning or any other approach, as long as it facilitates curiosity and inquiry in a learner and helps him/her to attain the feeling of creating something new, it is a step towards Joyful Learning. All these approaches help a learner to develop competencies required by him/her in real-life. The present Handbook has been created as a resource for practitioners and explains, in detail, the concept of Joyful Learning, the science behind it, ways to make a classroom joyful. Focus in the Handbook is to give clarity about integrating various subjects to achieve joyful teaching and learning. Suggestive exemplars of integrated lesson plans have been given in this hanbook for reference. It also explores a new dimension of using a home space like Kitchen as a resource for Joyful Learning, specially in the times like Covid-19. Foreword (v)Acknowledgement (vi)Patrons : Sh.

Then we brought for you the Handbook on 21st Century Skills, to facilitate a clear understanding of these important skills, and also chart out the ways to collectively collaborate towards attaining the 21st century skills in each learner. NOW, WE ARE HERE BEFORE YOU WITH THE HANDBOOK OF JOYFUL LEARNING. Together, we shall understand the concept, do's and implementation of making learning joyful for students.I am sure you remember us! We are Uday and Roshni. We met you in Handbook for Students. In that Handbook, we explored a few ways to be ready for the 21st Century. Handbook of Joyful Learning2CHAPTER2Joyfully We All Shall Learn! Various ways like project - based learning, active learning, inclusive classrooms, activity - based learning, integration of arts and STEM encourage learning beyond the classroom boundaries. Though all these transformations have been way different from each other in form and function, all these are directed towards common objective of engaging learners in the classroom. Roshni, I begin with my first question. What is joyful learning? O Great! That will make my concepts clearer. Uday, I shall begin with a little background information. Joyfully We All Shall Learn!3 The broader aims of all these initiatives, however, are effective only if they are successful at weaving the element of joy into learning experiences. Joyful Learning brings sparkle in the eyes of students and excites and empowers them to engage with learning experiences in fun-filled, playful manner. THE TAKEAWAY: Joyful Learning is the mode of learning in which learners are given opportunities to experience emotions of surprise in delightful ways, nurture their curiosity, while interacting with meaningful content through a supportive community of classmates / peer group and teachers.That means, an attempt to spark up the curiosity of learners, give expression to their creativity, nudge them to imbibe values and build character, form meaningful connections through collaboration, thereby making learning authentic and meaningful. Got it? Some serious theory, now! 2.1. Meaning of Joyful Learning: According to Oxford Dictionary, \"Joy is a feeling of great pleasure and happiness.\". Alice Udvari - Solner and Paula M. Kluth in their book \" Joyful Learning - Active and Collaborative Strategies for Inclusive Classrooms (2007) \" define \" Joyful Learning \" in context of education as: \"Joyful learning means positive intellectual and emotional state of learners. This state or experience is achieved when an individual or a group is deriving pleasure and a sense of satisfaction from the process of learning.\"1 1. https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-1428-6_795#howtocite accessed on 6th December 2020.Handbook of Joyful Learning4 A joyful classroom engages learners actively and infuses enthusiasm and joy through activities in the form of games, stories, role plays, puzzles, hands on activities, songs and dance. Superior learning takes place when classroom experiences are enjoyable and relevant to students', by ensuring that all subjects are integrated in a manner which encourages the learners to build connections with the real world. Absolutely, Uday! The idea is to ensure that values and life-skills are seamlessly embedded and competencies like Citizenship and Character are also efficaciouslty mapped in the curriculum. A natural corollary is the cross-cutting theme of Environment and Conserving Water that has been interspersed in the lesson plans designed under the 'Joyful' umbrella. I am confused. Is it not what is expected to be done in Art-Integrated Learning or Experiential Learning? What about the ways through which classrooms become joyful? So, what you mean is, learning will be more relevant, engaging and deeply rooted in honing skills and competencies? Joyfully We All Shall Learn!5 THE TAKEAWAY: My dear Uday, Art integrated learning/Activity Based Learning/ Fun, games and studies/Sport Integrated Teachers' method! All these forms of teaching-learning make a classroom joyful. We get joy when we achieve something after doing or experiencing it ourselves. Okay! Finally, I Got it. Means, if we study through the ways incorporating various art-based/ sports -based/ real life activities/ practical activities, we are actually experiencing the doing of the task and learn while experiencing that. Naturally, it fills us with joy. Don't you remember setting the stage and props for the annual drama show. It was such a joy! Yes, indeed. Now, we shall understand some science behind joyful learning. Roshni, from where do you get all this knowledge? Uday ji!!! 1st, there is no shortcut to success. 2nd, I study and research through various available sources; internet, books, my own experiences, my observations. NOW PAY ATTENTION!Handbook of Joyful Learning6 Let me explain this. 2.2. Some Science Behind Joyful Learning: Research conducted on brain validates the fact that when the element of fun is missing from the learning, the element of actual learning taking place also remains absent. In a study conducted by education theorist Krashen (1982), it was proposed that when learning is associated with strong positive emotions (joy), retention of learning by students takes place.2 On the other hand, according to a study published in a journal of National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) by Christianson (1992)3, clinical evidence of cognitive psychology studies show that boredom, stress, confusion, anxiety and low levels of motivation hinders learning. Michael F. Opitz and Michael P. Ford in their book \"Engaging minds in the classroom: the surprising power of joy\", suggest that knowledge and skills must be acquired in a way that cause happiness. They further propose that in order to imbibe new ideas and take risk of learning new content, persistence and willingness to work through difficulties is required. Such an experience brings joy to students. THE TAKEAWAY: Neuroscientists have studied that optimal learning takes place when such conditions are provided to the brain which can trigger brain to change in response to stimuli. Engaged and motivated students, under minimal stress, have high cognitive abilities, make connections and experience \"aha\" moments (Willis, 2007). https:// www.psychologytoday.com/files/ attachments/4141/the-neuroscience-joyful- education-judy-willis-md.pdf 1.

(1992). Emotional stress and eyewitness memory: A critical review. Psychological Bulletin, 112(2), 284- 309. Joyfully We All Shall Learn!72.3 What happens in Joyful Learning? What Happens in the Process of Joyful Learning?What does it lead to? Perspective Change Practicing Joyful Teaching Learning brings change in perspective; from didactic teaching learning approach to constructivist approach, from teacher-centered learning to student-oriented, from passive teaching to active engagement and from stand - alone subjects to integrated learning. All would suffice to ensure actual learning taking place, if associated with the element of joy. Improved motivation Students become self-motivated to explore ideas and concepts and put their best efforts to express their learning. Joy acts as an intrinsic driving force to direct learning towards meeting objectives. Engaged learners If lesson plans are designed in such a way that students participate actively in the learning process, Learning is not only a fun-filled exercise but evokes other aspects associated with learning process like taking pride, brainstorming, asking questions and reflective thinking. Learners are actively involved in the learning process, enjoy their learning, make connections with themselves and the world around them and construct meaning in their own contexts. Authentic Learning Joyful learning lessons are built around learning experiences that let learners relate to their local environment and their past knowledge and experiences through activities like plays, stories, songs, art, music and drawings. Encouraged autonomy and control Joyful learning accentuates self-directed learning ability among learners as learners enjoy their learning and the learning is implied instead of imposed. In a joyful learning classroom, traditional chalk-talk methods of teaching are replaced with experiences that are personalized to needs and interests of learners, focused towards process more than the product and value individual expressions and reflections of learners. THE TAKEAWAY: Impact of joy on the overall learning can be summed up as follows: Joy, as an important component of true learning, encompasses collaboration, connection, sharing and pride. For an instance, emotions like joy, pride and curiosity are evident in a classroom where children learn about fractions, parts of a flower, molecules through activities like paper folding, poems and theatre respectively. Handbook of Joyful Learning8 Crucial Terms for Joyful Lessons9CHAPTER3Crucial Terms for Joyful Lessons These are the terms referring to various kinds of strategies used to make lessons joyful. Also, for the skills that are developed while learning joyfully.Where have we used these terms? Before proceeding further, let me explain a few terms that have been used in this handbook. 3.1. 21st Century Skills: 3.1.1. Critical Thinking is the capability of objective analysis of information and includes the following qualities: fairness and open-mindedness; activeness and being informed; willingness to question or to entertain doubts; being independent. recognizing and assessing values, peer pressure and the media influences (for a creative under- standing of critical thinking, refer to CBSE's comic book 'Cogito')Handbook of Joyful Learning10 3.1.2. Problem Solving is the skill of: identifying the relevant piece of information when faced with a mass of data (most of which is irrelevant), discarding information that may not be useful to give new information, and finally, relating one set of information to another in a different form by using experience, relating new problems to ones we have previously solved. 3.1.3. Creativity and Innovation: These are the skills to explore and create fresh ways of thinking. Creativity refers to new way of seeing or doing things and includes four components: fluency (generating new ideas), flexibility (shifting perspective easily), originality (conceiving of something new), and elaboration (building on others' ideas). Innovative Skills mean skills for thinking creatively to develop something new/ unique / improved / distinctive. 3.1.4. Collaboration: Collaboration is the ability to effectively work together with others. This skill involves working together while taking actions respecting others' needs and perspectives and contributing to and accepting the finale. Collaboration helps to develop interest and fun in the teaching learning process. It effectively broadens the cultural, social, and environmental boundaries and helps a child to understand social and environmental concerns better. 3.1.5. Communication: Communication refers to the ability to express one's opinions, desires, needs, apprehensions etc. oneself appropriately, verbally and non-verbally. 3.1.6. Flexibility and Adaptability: Flexibility and Adaptability refer to a person's ability to change his actions and steps taken by him according to a new situation, and efficiently facing an unprecedented situation, without compromising on ethics and values. Adaptability can be defined as creating modifications or changes in oneself to suit the new environment. For students, these can be understood as the skills required being flexible and adaptive to the situations around them and finding the best possible solution to go forward despite adverse conditions.Crucial Terms for Joyful Lessons11 3.1.7: Leadership and Responsibility: Leadership is the ability to lead a team and be capable of effective team management in relation to real world challenges. These skills teach a child how to support the development of key personal qualities such as perseverance, being committed and responsible, resilience and self-confidence and how to foster a commitment to life-long learning. Being Responsible means being a good and effective/sensitive citizen. Be aware of the important social and national issues that may have an impact on our daily lives both as a human-being and as a student, be aware of the important social and national issues that may have an impact on lives in future both as a human -being and as a student, be aware of our fundamental duties and rights and embed the core democratic values of India and strive to live by them. 3.1.8 Initiative and Self-Direction: Initiation skill involves the ability to begin a task independently. It helps the child to build his/her own path of development. Self-direction is a skill to work with integrity on self-motivation and taking initiatives. 3.1.9. Productivity and Accountability: Productivity in the student can be understood as fulfilment of any task within a given time period. Accountability can be understood as feeling responsible for any task done. Developing these skills in a student helps him/her to work effectively and also make him/her reliable for other peers by being accountable for his/her actions. 3.1.10. Social and Cross-Cultural Interaction These are the skills to communicate, work collaboratively and effectively in diverse social and cultural environments 3.2. Commonly Used Terms/ Strategies 3.2.1 Rally Robin: In this strategy facilitator will give such kinds of questions to learners which have several answers. Learners will be divided into groups and write their answers and then, one by one, each answer will be discussed by the facilitator in the class 3.2.2 QAXP: Under this strategy, class will be divided in groups of four. Student 1 from first group will ask question. Student 2 from the same group will answer the question. Student 3 will add to the response of student 2 without repeating anything what student 2 had already told. Student 4 will tell question and response of student 2 and 3 by paraphrasing it. Topic for the question will be chosen by both students and facilitator together. Topics can be chosen on the level of problems faced by learners. Handbook of Joyful Learning123.3 Dictoglass: This is a strategy to reconstruct the text by learners close to original text through words and phrases chosen by them. It can be done in groups or on individual basis. It will help students to think creatively and also they will know how to form sentences and what all punctuation rules they need to keep in mind while recreating the text. 3.4. Think Pair Share: This is kind of activity where a teacher chooses a text to ask a question from the children. Children will think about the topic. They will then find themselves a partner and form a pair and then they share their thoughts with each other. After the discussion happens in pairs, facilitator will include whole class and then discuss about the question broadly. 3.5. Visual Artwork: This will help children to understand the text better by seeing images, sculptures and making collages on the topic. 3.6. Concentric Circles: Learners will form concentric circles by facing each other. Facilitator will give them a question which they will discuss with their partner. Then student standing on the outer circle will move right or left as per teacher instructions resulting in changing of partner. Facilitator will give them new question to discuss with the new partner. 3.7. Fish Bowl: This is an activity that helps in maintaining large group discussion. Class will be divided in small groups of 4-5 students and teacher will give some topics to discuss in groups to students. 3.8. Graffiti Board: This is a writing space provided by teacher where everyone shares writes their thoughts on different topics. This will help children to learn about each other's ideas. 3.9. Fan N Pick: It is a simple learning strategy. Class will be divided into groups of 4 students. Student 1 will fans out a card and will say, ''Pick a card'', student 2 will pick a card which has some question return on it related to the topic. Student 3 will answer that question. Student 4 will paraphrase, clarifies, praise the answer. This activity will be repeated by changing the roles in the group so that each child has to play each role and no one child dominates in the group. Crucial Terms for Joyful Lessons133.10. Crack the Code: This activity can be used in various forms. Facilitator can make some codes for children to decode and get the message of teacher. Later children can also make their own codes to give information to each other. 3.11. Hot Seat: This is a fun activity in which learners will chose them as a character and will answer the question as that character. For example, if a child chooses to be a vegetable, then they will tell about their qualities and benefits which people get from them. This will help children to learn about each vegetable uniqueness and benefits. 3.12. DRTA: Directed Reading Thinking Activity is a comprehensive activity in which teacher will read a text and ask children to make question and do predictions. Students will read further to see if their predictions are correct or not. This activity can be done in groups, on individual basis or in whole class depending on the topic and teacherHandbook of Joyful Learning14CHAPTER4The Do's for Making a Classroom Joyful Please show! I am all ears. Uday, with all the talk and discussions done till now, I can think of a few things that are required to convert a class into joyful classroom. 4.1. Principles for planning Joyful Learning lesson plans Planning lessons that facilitate joy to permeate in classroom learning requires a great deal of contemplation as all learning experiences may or may not be joyful. Judy Willis, a renowned neuroscientist and middle school teacher in her article \"The Neuroscience of Joyful Education\", proposed three important neuroscience concepts (RAD) to be considered while planning joyful lessons: Novelty promotes information transmission through Reticular Activating System. Stress free classrooms promote learning and retention through Amygdala Affective Filter. Learning linked with pleasurable associations leads to release of Dopamine (the happiness hormone). Increased dopamine levels, according to studies, result in enhanced motivation, perseverance, attention and creativity.THE TAKEAWAY: Teachers should design lesson plans in such a way that they excite students towards learning, challenge their thinking, elevate level of dopamine and reduce stress and anxiety. The Do' s for Making a Classroom Joyful15In order to provide joyful learning opportunities, the following principles may be applied: 4.1.1 Build intrigue The teachers should strive to incorporate element of curiosity in the lesson plan. The experiences should be planned in such a manner that make students wonder and ponder, thereby challenging their thinking. For example, making a flying object out of available materials, making patterns out of objects, designing a ludo game on skip counting are some of the learning experiences that would compel learners to brainstorm and think creatively. The learning experiences should be so designed that they facilitate and encourage exploration. 4.1.2. Personalize One of the objectives of joyful learning is to ensure that learners with varied abilities meaningfully interact with the educational content individually, as well as in group. In order to achieve this objective, it is crucial that learning experiences are tailored according to diverse needs and abilities of learners. One size- fits-all based experiences totally mutilate the core objective of joyful learning, that is, to make learning an enjoyable and interesting experience for all learners, irrespective of their abilities and learning styles. When students are given choices in the way they study or express their learning, stress level diminishes and students are able to direct their learning at their own pace, without fear of failure.Handbook of Joyful Learning164.1.3. Facilitate connection building Learning triggers emotions of joy and wonder in learners only if they are able to make some connections of the current experience with their previous experiences and past knowledge. Therefore, it is the responsibility of teachers to make provision for learners to be able to make relevant, meaningful connections while learning. Learners of a joyful lesson plan should be able to answer, \"Why are we learning this?\". For example, a learning experience on 'breathing' would only spark joy and enthusiasm and bring 'aha' moment only when learners will be able to relate it to their life (recall how their breathing rate changes when they run or exercise) and world around them (how fish breathe through gills). A joyful learning lesson plan thus cannot be planned in isolation with the existing world and teachers should brainstorm experiences in such a way that learners, at some point, are successful in building those underlying connections in joyful manner. 4.1.4. Bring novelty Children are natural learners and under stress free environment, they can create something new out of the available materials. You must have seen children creating some different structures using blocks, rather than merely imitating the designs already available with them. This willingness to create something unique can be effectively utilized by teachers while creating lesson plans. The lesson plans may include learning experiences in which learners have to create something unique, based on their knowledge, past experiences and using their creativity. For example, in order to sensitize students towards saving water to ensure its future availability, teachers may design a learning experience wherein learners are required to make a model of a rain harvesting system using clay, blocks or any other easily available material. Not only such experiences would bring 'aha' moments of joy and instill a sense of achievement in learners, they will also serve the purpose of the lesson, to make learning happen in authentic, real terms. 4.1.5. Foster reflective - thinking and self-evaluation Lesson plans designed to incorporate joyful learning should provide opportunities to students for self-reflection and evaluation. The experiences should be chosen in such a way that students are able to check for themselves, what they did well, what they could have done better. Individual expressions are outcomes of a joyful learning lesson plan. Teachers may use progress charts for students to mark their learning progress, at different stages of the lesson plan. The Do' s for Making a Classroom Joyful174.1.6. Transcend subject boundaries Most of the real-world concepts are not confined to subject boundaries and learners also analyze and understand them through a broader lens, going beyond the subject. For example, distance and speed are concepts of Science but include Mathematics in explaining how speed changes with the change in distance and time taken. The same concept can be extended further including social studies when students explore how speed of cars is slow while driving uphill and how physical features of a place impact driving speed. On the other hand, when learning experiences are planned subject-wise, they incapacitate learners to make meaningful connections with the real-world, thereby impeding learning. 4.2. A Joyful Classroom - sample case study Ms. Rita Baweja*, Environmental Science teacher of grade 2, wants to teach 'types of plants' to her students. To make the lesson interesting, she weaved a variety of joyful learning experiences for her students. The lesson in her class progressed as follows: She took students on a walk of the school garden, there she asked students to observe different plants on parameters like name of the plant, long/short, soft stem/hard stem, need support/don't need support. She asked students to draw a table with these column headers and ask names of plants from the gardener in the school. She then took students on the nature walk and instructed them to do the activity in 30 minutes of time. After 30 minutes, students returned to the classroom. The teacher conducted a bundling activity where she asked students to one by one speak about the plant they had observed, and she kept on writing details under different columns: herbs, shrubs, creepers, climbers and tree. She then collated students' findings under these categories. Carrying forward the same activity, Mathematics teacher taught students to make a Tally table describing numbers of plants observed belonging each category; how many herbs, how many shrubs etc. were found by students. She then explained how they can represent the tally information through a bar-graph showing numbers of plants being observed from each category as part of garden walk activity. Next day, Ms. Rita reiterated features of herbs, shrubs, creepers, climbers and trees in relation to what students had observed during garden walk. Some students also shared that they had similar plants in their homes and in neighbourhood. The teacher asked them to create a Graphic Organizer of any one plant they had in their home or in neighbourhood and present it in the class. On the same day, in sculpture class, students learnt to make clay models of different types of plants on the basis of features they have studied. Students were asked to make clay models of any one type of plant and capture even minute but important details also in their clay models (like providing support in case of climber, hard and bushy stem of shrub) using different sculpture tools. The teacher intervened during creation of models and while students were giving their models a finishing touch. It was decided that these models will be exhibited during class PTM (Parent Teacher Meeting) in the coming week. The activity engaged students actively and students had Handbook of Joyful Learning18fun messing with clay and shaping their models. Students experienced 'ahaa' moments when they clay model was ready and looked very similar to the plant they had observed or seen in their surroundings. Next day, theatre class teacher scripted a theatrical presentation in which students were given characters of different plants who were talking about their importance and uses. The students excitedly rehearsed for the activity and the activity was to be presented before parents on Earth Day. The lesson culminated in the theatrical presentation followed by a reflection sheet filled by all students. At the end, students were given reflection sheets to rate their learning about the topic on a five-point rating scale and write down their feelings; which learning engagement excited them the most, which they could have done better and reasons thereof. * Fictional character. Similarity, if any, unintended. In the above- mentioned lesson, students learnt different subject topics but through integration of the common theme across all subjects. At the same time, they engaged themselves with the lesson actively and were given opportunities to reflect on their learning experiences. 4.3. A CASE STUDY: Nali - Kali approach of teaching learning4 Literally meaning 'Play and Learn', Nali Kali was a UNICEF assisted Pilot project run in H.D. Kote Mysore District, Karnataka, based on learning model followed by Rishi Valley schools in Andhra Pradesh. Nali Kali model was specifically designed as a joyful learning educational reform, designed to meet the needs of multi-grade, multi- level classrooms of Government Primary schools in Karnataka. It aimed at breaking down teacher-student hierarchy, eliminating stress of traditional examination system and retains children in school through play-based learning. 4.3.1 Salient Features: Salient features of Nali-Kali teaching approach were: Learning through exploration Attainment of Minimum Levels of Learning (MLL) by students through play, active engagement and peer-teaching. Accommodating various learning styles Focus on reflective thinking and self-evaluationTHE TAKEAWAY: This lesson plan infused in them skills like Communication, Critical thinking, Collaboration, Creativity and attitudes like confidence and cooperation. Planned in collaboration with all subject teachers as well as activity teachers, the plan seamlessly blended subjects while addressing a common theme. 4. http://ssakarnataka.gov.in/pdfs/int_lep/nk_report.pdf The Do' s for Making a Classroom Joyful194.3.2. Nali-Kali Classroom Process: The curriculum was divided into small units called 'phases' or 'milestones' and arranged in the form of a ladder. Milestones were set for each subject and in order to attain mastery over each milestone the child needed to go through several learning activities called \"learning steps\". The activity cards having textual materials, songs, art and craft tasks, roles and puzzles is used to facilitate learning. Students can choose any card of their choice to acquire mastery in a subject. A non-threatening evaluation system is deployed on a comprehensive and continuous basis. Students' knowledge and skills are evaluated in the form of a learning ladder. The classroom management approach flexible in nature wherein nature of activity taken up by child was enforced rather than caste, gender age or abilities of students. Nali - Kali model specifically caters to multi-level, multi-grade classrooms where students sit in circles called learning cycles. The children pick up a card and sit in the appropriate learning cycles. Once the child completes the task/milestones, the child reports to the teacher and will mark entry in the progress chart. Learners complete all steps in order to learn a teaching item/milestone. THE TAKEAWAY: Children, in this approach, learn at their own pace and formation of group changes according the activity being done by children. The learning ladder shows the progress of the child. This is a step towards Competancy Based Education. The role of teacher is of a facilitator of learning who plans all tasks/milestones and assists students in picking up their learning cards and form peer-supported and participatory learning groups. The teacher is also required to mark students' progress on learning ladder (the progress chart) and help slow learners understand and complete their task .Handbook of Joyful Learning20CHAPTER5Joyful integration of Subjects: Exemplars This chapter delineates the lesson plan exemplars having integration of various subjects. Various chapters of different subjects, but having similar themes, have been integrated to carry out the joyful teaching and learning. Let's have a look: Instructions- A reference guide to reading the lesson plans 1. The learning engagements/activities given in the exemplar plan are suggestive, not mandatory and can be moulded as per the need and feasibility of the learners. 2. Matrix is representative of the flow of lesson plan. Each row with the mentioned day shows possible subject wise learning engagements. 3. The implementation stage for a subject and the proceeding further for the same or another subject may go hand in hand. 4.

Implementation of lesson plan- Stage 1 Subject Day Learning engagement Nature Walk(MATH)1 Facilitator will take the children for a nature walk and ask them to collect as many as twigs as they can. Once all the children come back in the classroom facilitator will divide them into group of four each. Each group will be provided with a blank paper folded into half. Each group will be asked to count the twigs collected by them in total. Write the numeral on the first one-half side of the given paper if they know. Now s/he will ask them to make a group of tens of the twigs and then write the numeral on the other half side and compare if they are getting the same number? This activity will help learners understand that each number is nothing but the group of few tens and ones and numeral for the same is easily generated if ones know the number of tens and ones. Recite a Rhyme (EVMS)1 To introduce the poem, the facilitator will take two hand puppets of birds and recite the poem- Two little dicky birds. Two little dicky birds sitting on a wall, one named Peter and one named Paul. Fly away Peter and fly away Paul. The facilitator will tell the students that the two birds have come to their class today to tell their story. We, birds feel very nice when we fly high above in the open sky. We can see the beautiful gardens, rivers, tall trees, beautiful and colourful earth. But we feel sad when we see the garbage lying here and there, huge and tall buildings, smoke and pollution. Anticipated Oho moment as they will realize that we as humans are filling our Earth with garbage. Dreams (EVMS) 1 The facilitator will ask the students to share their feelings how they would feel if they were a bird. The students will share their feelings in front of their friends.

The facilitator will ask the students to volunteer for role-play activity. The students can use the props provided by the facilitator. Audio Visuals (EVMS)3 The facilitator will proceed the topic of birds and its home by sharing that just like human, birds too need a house to be safe and protected and to keep their eggs and young ones safe. Most of the birds make their nest on tree branches or roof tops. Birds lay their eggs in the nest and keep their young ones safe in the nest till the time they learn how to fly. The facilitator will show a video to the students using the given link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFV1K8N37ps The facilitator will sensitize the students not to disturb the birds in the nest and motivate the students to plant more trees as they are a home to birds which are our flying friends. Read and and Discussion (EVMS)4 The facilitator will tell the students that today they will share some interesting information about birds. The facilitator will share with the students that just like crow and parrot, as we come to know from the lesson 'Mittu and the parrot', other birds also make sound. Birds usually communicate with two types of sounds. They make a call, which is a single sound. Some birds sing a song, which is a series of notes. Birds like cuckoo, mynah and nightingale make sounds that are sweet and musical. Parrots and mynah can copy human sounds. Let's proceed further and learn what birds eat. Sharing an incident (EVMS)4 In the lesson 'Mittu and the mango tree', Mittu loved to eat mangoes. The facilitator will ask the students to share an incident if they have seen any bird eating. The students will share their experience. The facilitator will share with the students, information about eating habits of birds. Different birds have different eating habits. Usually birds eat insects, worms, seeds, nuts, fruits and berries. But birds travel to far places to find food for their young ones. More over due to a smaller number of trees, birds find difficulty in finding food for themselves. The facilitator will motivate the students to create bird feeder in their garden, to provide food and water to the birds easily. Read and Recite (HINDI)5 ikB eSa The facilitator will draw a web diagram on the board with the help of the students describing a parrot.

Implementation of lesson plan- Stage 1 Subject Day Learning Engagement Find blue and green in me! (EVMS)1 The facilitator will divide the class into groups and will provide them each with a big circle representing Globe/ Earth. Then s/he will ask them to look at the globe and try to color the water as blue and the land as green. S/he will also tell them to draw black outlines for the countries and continents if they want. This activity will help them observe the globe and use their understanding to create the Earth. It will help them have a fair understanding of the fact that more than 70% of earth is covered with water. Origami (English) 1 The facilitator will ask a question from students. From where do we get water on Earth? or What is the biggest source of water on Earth? Most of the students will come up with common answers. Rain. Then the facilitator will ask few more questions to get learners connected to the topic. Which season is going on? In which season do they see a rainbow? What is the color of clouds during that season? Which activities do they enjoy in that season? What all do you see during rainy season? The teacher will get their responses in the form of words like clouds, puddles, umbrellas and boats etc. S/he will provide them with a sheet to create a boat with paper folding. The whole process of creating the boat will be taken step by step and the students will follow the instructions and create their own boats. Then the students will be taken to the school pool where they will float their boats in the water. The students will be excited to perform this activity. Then the teacher will ask, 'Could they float their boat in the classroom?' The students' response would be 'No'. Then the teacher will ask 'Why? What is required to float a boat?' The response would be, \"We need water for the boat to float.\" Anticipated Ahaa... moment as the students will feel happy to see that they could create a boat and boat requires water to float Once the facilitator enters the class, all the students will share their experience of floating paper boats in the water. The facilitator will use their responses and ask them 'What if we don't have enough rain/water?'Handbook of Joyful Learning30Pause and Ponder 1 The students will say they will not be able to drink water, take a bath, cook food, etc. Then the teacher will ask them, so what should one do to save water? The students will come up with varied responses, which will be written by the facilitator on the board e.g. Close the tap while brushing, take a bucket bath instead of shower bath and pour less water in a glass for drinking and refill it further, if required. The facilitator will keep on adding responses. This will help them understand the fact that we need to save each drop of water. To ignite learner's mind, the facilitator will show topic \"JUGS and MUGS\" from the NCERT book and give them a minute to express their understanding related to it in short. Wonder Wall (HINDI) 1 cPps (ENGLISH)3 The facilitator will show them a video on uses of water. Video link on uses of water https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOFGFwyXft8 Think pair and share(ENGLISH)3 Then the facilitator will divide the class in pairs and ask students to go through the reading. Guided practice - Read the given passage Uses of water We all use water for drinking, washing, cleaning, cooking, and growing food \u2014 making it the most precious resource for survival. All water that we use comes from rain which fills local lakes, rivers, streams or underground aquifers, depending on your city and state. We use water in the following ways. Household Uses Common household works consume a lot of water in bathing and toilets, washing machines and kitchen sink. Much of our freshwater resources are also used for watering lawns, flower beds, and vegetable gardens, as well as washing cars and filling swimming pools.Joyful Integration of Subjects : Exemplars31 Communities Cities use water for firefighting, street cleaning, and watering public areas such as parks and roads. Think about all the water that is used by restaurants, hospitals, laundries, dry cleaners, golf courses, hotels, car washes, beauty shops, barber shops, gas stations, and health clubs as well as the other businesses in town. These all add up to quite a big demand on local water supplies. Farming The amount of water needed to run a farm is tremendous. When we think of water in a farm, we think of watering crops; but the amount of water needed on a dairy farm is just as large. Recreation and Transportation Many people enjoy fishing, boating, sailing, canoeing, rafting, and swimming, as well as many other recreational activities that depend on water. (Source: https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-do-we-use- water-and-why-conserve-3157863 ) Then the facilitator will ask them to read and discuss the sheet and enlist the various uses of water on an A4 sheet. The sheet would further be displayed in the classroom. Concentric Circles (HINDI)3 dfork dk story and Make lemonade (MATH)3 The facilitator will create 4 groups in a class and would ask them to read the story (Village fair), discuss it amongst themselves and demonstrate or enact the chapter in front of the class. Each group will come up with an act based on the story. Then the teacher will provide them with lemons, sugar and salt. The students will mix all the ingredients in a big bowl, then add water and prepare lemonade in the class. Then the facilitator will provide them big glasses and ask the students to fill them with lemonade. The students will tell they could only fill 20 glasses and that would not suffice for all the classmates, then the facilitator will provide them small glasses and they could fill further make 40 glasses with it. So, all students will be able to get lemonade. Anticipated Ahaa . Moment as they make lemonade and everyone would have it. This activity will develop their understanding that large vessel can hold more quantity and small vessel can hold less quantity.Handbook of Joyful Learning32Comprehension Exercise (ENGLISH)3 The facilitator will explain an exercise (ring the vessel with more water) in NCERT book and the students will complete the activity independently. Quiz time (EVMS) The students will be divided in groups and will be asked riddles, or questions and the students will play quiz and answer questions like: Close me if I am not in use. (tap) I am very deep. People fill buckets of water from me using rope. (well) Boats sail in me. (water bodies like rivers, lakes) I have holes in my body, kids love to use me during bath. (shower) Unseen Comprehension (ENGLISH)4 The facilitator will take up an unseen passage to check their understanding and ask questions. Comprehension Passage Read the following passage and answer the given questions: Water is essential for every living being. We need water to drink, cook, clean and bathe. We also require this natural resource for agriculture, industries and transportation as in boats and ships. The Earth is covered with 70% water and often called the 'Blue Planet'. Even though we have so much water on the earth, only 1% is usable as the rest is either salt -water, as found in seas and oceans or is frozen in ice caps. With an increase in population, the demand for this limited resource is also increasing. Today, water scarcity is a problem faced by many people throughout the world. It is high time we take steps to use this important resource judiciously so that we have enough water for everyone in the future.

During second reading, the students will refer to the book and follow the teacher as s/he recites the poem with proper voice modulation and gestures. Referring to the picture the facilitator will discuss the following comprehension questions to recall the poem and to check their understanding: Where does the rain fall? What do people use when it rains? How do children save themselves from getting wet? Do children enjoy jumping in the puddles? The students will solve vocabulary exercises in book with the help of the facilitator e.g. complete the story in the book etc. Create a Graphic Organizer The facilitator will show the video with pauses and motivate them to notice the jugs and mugs learning in the story. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZijU7tGrzM The facilitator will pose them a question based on story line and simulate their thinking. Q. The crow found a big vessel with very low volume of water which he can't drink, but instead of flying away to find another resource, he used the same water smartly as per the condition. This happened every time in the areas suffering from scarcity of water. This area is increasing everyday due to insensitivity to the use of water. What is that ONE thing you will not do/ do to save water? For example, I will not leave water in my glass OR I will take only that much water in my glass which I can finish. The learners will answer it in one sentence on post it and paste it on a chart paper to make a wonder wall.Handbook of Joyful Learning34Pour and Observe(MATH)2 The facilitator will arrange various objects like water bottles, glass, jars (live objects in class) of different size/ shapes along with a small glass and water (can be done in variations with same objects) The students will now pour water in different vessels by measuring with the small glass.

Catch the context clues(English)4 The facilitator will divide students in groups and then ask them to find out difficult words from the chapter 'My SillyHandbook of Joyful Learning42 Sister'. One representative student from the group will speak one word and the facilitator will list that word on the board. Once all groups have given difficult words, the facilitator will read aloud one difficult word before the class and ask each group to find its meaning in reference to the context of the chapter (they will be allowed to open their textbook to find meaning). The facilitator will set the timer in an alarm clock/smart phone and students would be required to find meaning in context of usage of the word in the textbook within the time frame. The moment alarm clock will buzz, all students will freeze in the position they will be in until the facilitator says 'over'. Then the facilitator will ask meaning of the word from each group and the group giving the meaning closest to its actual meaning would be declared winner for that round. Similarly, meanings of all other words will also be derived from students based on their understanding of the text. To make the activity easier, the facilitator can tell students the paragraph number in which that word has been used. Simultaneously, the students will write meanings of the words in their notebooks. Anticipated Ahaa moment will be there for group of students whose meaning of the word would be similar/ closest to the actual meaning of the word Trace the shortest route (MATH)5 The facilitator will discuss activity given on Page 52, ' Gibli and the Grains' and demonstrate how to find shortest route. Thereafter, referring to chapter 'Bahadur Bitto' of Hindi, the facilitator will tell students to imagine that 'Bitto' from Hindi Chapter 'Bahadur Bitto' has to go to a temple as a custom in her family. There are three possible ways to reach the temple and students will find the shortest route by measuring the distance in centimeter using ruler. The following image will be printed on paper and will be distributed to all students in the class. Route A ________cm Route B _________cm Route C __________cm Shortest Route : Route ______Joyful Integration of Subjects : Exemplars43'Mera Sathi kaun' (HINDI)5 The facilitator will select difficult words from the chapter and note them down in her record (a day before, the teacher can also ask students to give difficult words from the chapter). The facilitator will then randomly whisper words to some students and meanings to other students. Then the teacher will ask that student, who has been given a word, to stand up and say aloud. \"Surya ka will say aloud the word given to him/her in the blank given above. Listening to this, that student who would feel that the meaning given to him/her matches best with the word said aloud, that student will move towards the student who just said aloud the word and stand next to that student. Similarly, one by one teacher would ask all students with word to say aloud the above lines and the students with meaning would pair up with student with word. The facilitator will not disclose correct answers until all words are paired up with their meanings. Once all words will be covered, the facilitator will one by one confirm the word-meaning pairs and then write them on the board and students would note them down in their notebook. In this activity, if some students do not get word or meaning, they could be asked 5to speculate the meaning of words in reference to their usage in the chapter. Chunk Reading (English)6 The facilitator will read and explain the lesson 'My Brother' from the textbook and learners will be asked to work in groups to recreate the text. Word Chain (ENGLISH)7 The facilitator will accumulate all keywords in the chapter through students' responses and write them on the board. Then the facilitator will introduce Word Chain game wherein students will be divided into groups and will be given one keyword each. Students in each group will frame a sentence using the keyword given to them. The facilitator will assign time limit for this activity and each child in the group will represent one word of the sentence formed by the group. Students can be asked to make small placards representing their word. Once the time limit will lapse, the teacher will speak aloud \"Lock the chain\" and quickly students carrying placard of words in group will stand in correct order to represent their sentence and lock their hands together. The quicker the group will stand in correct order of words to form sentence with the given keyword with their hands locked, the more points they would score in the game (Anticipated Ahaa moment ....). The facilitator can set scores according to time taken by students in forming chain of words (for example if timeHandbook of Joyful Learning44 taken is less than 2 minutes, 10 marks , between two to three minutes - 5 marks and so on). Any group unable to make proper sentence can be assisted by the facilitator. The facilitator will check sentences and write them on the board which will then be noted by students in their notebooks. Fire in the mountain(EVMS)7 The facilitator will introduce the game Fire in the mountain - the learners will form a circle and one child will stand in- between, they will all move in circle shouting fire in the mountain run run run. The child in the centre will call any number like 3, 4, 6 the learners will form group as per the numbers. The learners who will be left have to move out from the game. The game will be repeated till only few children are left in the circle. After the game facilitator will ask the learners few questions like- How did you feel when you join a group of required number? How did you feel if you could not join any group? Do you like to be with people? The facilitator, on the basis of students' responses will build the understanding that just like there can be many types of groups, there can be different types of families like Nuclear family, Joint family Small family / Nuclear family A family consisting of a pair of adults and their children is called small family or nuclear family. Big family / Joint family / Extended family / Un-divided family Joint family or big family is large in size consisting of members of 3 or more generations such as grandparents, parents, siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins living together in one home. Question hour (English)8 The facilitator will divide students into groups and then ask them to discuss question answers of the chapter. Each group will be given one question and once all have framed their answer, the facilitator will discuss them in the class and thereafter students will note them in their note book. Create and Communicate(EVMS)8 The facilitator will divide the class into groups of five, assigning one family story (given on pages no 140 to 143) to each group and time to read the story. After reading the story, each group will draw a family tree of the family of their story on the floor of the classroom (using chalk/sketch pen) and stand according to the family tree position. Each student of the group will represent one family member of the story and stand in that position in the family tree. OnceJoyful Integration of Subjects : Exemplars45 all groups will form such family tree according to the story assigned to them, each member of the group in that family will speak about its title and role in the family (like student representing 'dada' in Sitamma family will speak about his role and position title in the family tree, 'Sitamma' will speak about her position and so on). Once all groups will share their family tree with the rest of the class, the facilitator will ask them to answer all questions related to different stories in their notebook. 5.3.3. Proceeding further Subject Day Learning Engagement Think pair and share (HINDI)2 Students in pairs would think about the topic 'My vacation at my grandparent's home' and then share their reflection with their peers. To make the activity successful facilitator should allot time duration for thinking and reflection and then for discussion among peers. Pause and ponder 3 The facilitator will ask nick names of all students and then ask them to discuss with their seat partner about ways in which they are like their family members. Students would then read the story 'Anwari's Family' given on Page 27 and answer the questions that follow (on Page 28). Students would also ponder over questions given under 'Think and Write' given on page 28 and discuss them with their peers. My Inspiring Corner (EVMS)4 Referring to page 28 of the textbook, the facilitator will ask students what they have learnt from their family members and from whom? The facilitator will label four corners of the classrooms with family titles like 'father/grandfather', 'mother/grandmother', 'brother', 'sister'. When the facilitator will signal the activity, all students will move towards corner representing family member who has inspired them and from whom they have learnt some virtues and skills. The teacher will set time for allowing students to move to their respective corners. When all students will move to their inspiring corners, they will discuss the anecdote (incidents) when they learnt some skill or virtue from their family member among groups of their inspiring corners. Each inspiring corner group will make a web chart listing learning from that family member. Once all groups have created their web charts (within the stipulated time), the facilitator will display them on the board and read aloud what all learnings students would have acquired from their family members. (students sharing their anecdotal stories with their group members can turn out to be an ahaa moment in their learning)Handbook of Joyful Learning46Model Reading (Bahadur Bittoo)4 The teacher will read the chapter with proper modulation and students will repeat after her. The teacher will explain the essence of the chapter to be courageous in difficult times. Make meaning from the muddle(ENLISH)4 The facilitator will divide the class in groups for each question given on page 84 and 85 of the textbook. Each group will be asked to find answers to each question (so for seven questions seven groups can be made). The facilitator will set the time limit for completing the task and after the time limit has lapsed, the teacher will ask each group to share their answers. The facilitator will keep writing answers on the board as shared by each group and will check them through discussion with students at the end. In this manner, answers of all the questions will be derived from students through facilitator support while encouraging group learning. Helping Hand (ENGLISH)4 The facilitator will ask students to express their reflection on how they help their family members at home, then they will share their reflection with the whole class. Measure with Meter (MATH)4 The facilitator will bring a meter rod in the class and a day before the lesson, ask students to bring a small rope or ribbon. The facilitator will divide students in groups of four and will make meter ropes (as explained on page 53 of the textbook) for all groups. Groups will then be instructed to complete exercises given on page 54 and 55 of the textbook using meter ropes. Page 56 will be given as independent practice for home. Express through enactment (EVMS)5 The facilitator will discuss the meaning of customs in reference to 'Surekha's Story' as given on page 29 of the textbook. The facilitator will then divide the class into groups. In each group, students would be allotted a part of the classroom space to enact customs or practices followed in their homes before their group members. The group members will then find out the custom and then next member of the group will enact. All members of the group, once they will guess the customs of their peers, attempt questions given on page 29. Students would rejoice on enacting some routine practices like touching feet of elders, keeping shoes at a designated place, praying every day, offering water to tulsi plant/ sun etc. Those who would guess the custom/practices correctly would be delighted when they would be able to guess them correctly (Anticipated Ahaa moment) As an independent practice, students will be asked to interview their grandparents about any funny incident in their childhood. Joyful Integration of Subjects : Exemplars47Rapid Fire Round (English)6 The facilitator will first ask questions from within the story 'My Brother' to summarize the key points and then ask questions given on page 92 of the textbook to elicit responses from students and check their understanding. Questions will be asked by the facilitator in the form of rapid- fire round in which students will have to respond to the question very quickly. If they will not be able to answer the question they will say 'pass' and the question will move to the next child sitting. Once all questions have been covered students will be asked to write answers of questions given on page 92 and peercheck their work. The facilitator can come back to those students who could not answer, to check their understanding again and problems they faced in understanding the question and responding to it. Near and Far (Math) 6 The students will read 'Trip to Agra' based on it, they will be given a map to analyse which places are nearer or farther from main railway station after studying the map carefully Pg. 57. They will also attempt exercise given on page no.58. Group and Gossip (EVMS)6 Students will be divided in groups and they will gossip about the funny incident as shared by their grandparents. They will then be asked to write their feelings on incidents shared by their peers in one or two sentences on an A4 size sheet that will be shared per group. These reflections will then be collated from all groups and summarized by the teacher. Crack if you catch the ball (HINDI)6 The facilitator will pass the ball on which questions will be pasted in the form of slips pasted across the circumference of the ball. Both open and closed ended questions can be covered in this activity. The slips will be colour coded and the facilitator will throw the ball towards students (the ball to be used in this activity should be very light in weight and not too big). The student catching the ball will read the question as per the colour code given by the facilitator. Once the student will answer the question pasted on the ball, the ball will be sent back to the facilitator and will then be thrown at some other student. (a variation of this activity could be sequential passing of the ball from one student to another to check their understanding about the lesson) Brainstorming (MATH)7 The facilitator will ask students to take out their pencil box, lunch box, water bottles and any book and keep them on their table. The facilitator will then ask students to take pencil box in one hand and a book in another and check which one is heavier. Similarly, they will be asked to take their water bottle (filled with water) in one hand and their Handbook of Joyful Learning48 lunch box in another and find out which one is heavier. The facilitator will then introduce units of measurement gms and kgs and ask following questions : Which unit will you use to measure the weight of your body? Which unit will you use to measure the weight of a packet of chips? Which unit will you use to measure the weight of 10 toffees? (to enable better understanding of concept, the facilitator can show a video like the one available at https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=unkO9M8um6I ) Question Hour (HINDI)7 The facilitator will discuss question answers of the chapter with students and then students will note them in their notebooks. How much weight (Math)8 Students will complete activities given on page 115,116, 117 and 119 and guess weights objects given. Page no 117 will be given as independent activity to be completed by students from home. Facilitator will provide the students with a table wherein they will ask and write the weight of their family members and will find out the person with the maximum and minimum weight in the family (independent activity to be done from home) They will also arrange their family members in descending order according to their weight. Name Relationship Weight (kg) Ritu verma Mother 65 Share your story (HINDI)8 The facilitator will ask students to share any story their family members had shared with them in which they battled any situation with courage and determination. The facilitator will ask students to write about that incident in their words on A4 size sheet. Once all students will complete the activity, the facilitator will pin up all their work on display around the classroom and will ask students to take a round of the classroom and read stories shared by their peers. Joyful Integration of Subjects : Exemplars49Graffiti Board (ENGLISH)9 In order to develop feeling of empathy in students and sensitize them towards children with disabilities, the facilitator will conduct Graffiti Board activity. The facilitator will divide the class in groups and each group will discuss questions given under 'Team Time' section on page 93 of the textbook. Students will be allotted time to discuss the questions and each group will write their collated reflections in the form of answers to these questions. One by one each group representative will move towards the graffiti board and write reflections of own group. Rolled and Mold(MATH)9 The facilitator will ask students to depict weight of their family members by making clay models of family members keeping in mind their weight (as recorded by them as home assignment). Students will make clay models of their family members and then arrange them in decreasing order of their weight. The activity can be made more exciting for students by asking them to identify the family member by looking at their clay models (students in this case will not label the models as brother, sister, father, mother etc.). Anticipated ahaa moment for those who will be able to identify models correctly). (instead of clay, play dough and fevicol mould it can also be used, sculpture teacher in school can help students make perfect models of family members. Exercises (EVMS) 9 On the basis of their understanding of the family trees and roles of members as depicted during activity on Day 9, students will answer questions given in the textbooks (from page 140 to 143) Picture Writing 10 The facilitator will read pages 103,104 and 105 of Chapter 16 'Games people play' of Looking Around textbook.

Geography 4 The teacher will discuss the climatic conditions and various flora fauna found in various landforms. The students will be provided waste material like broom sticks, grass ,newspaper, stones, bottle corks and other locally available material colours, paints ,brushes. They will divide themselves into three groups and they will create three major landforms i.e. Plains, mountains and plateaus. The students will swap their land forms and explain the features of the land form created by the other group. They will learn about the land forms on their own which will be an ever-lasting learning. The students will learn to appreciate others, do justice to the land form assigned to them and they will also listen to each other carefully. AHA moment will be when they will create the landforms using the available material. Critical Thinking (reasons effectively) Communication (communicates clearly, accesses and evaluates information)Handbook of Joyful Learning74English 4 Vocabulary The teacher will divide the class into four teams. Each team will throw a word turn wise and the team who is supposed to answer will raise as many hands as possible. Now the questioning team will select the respondent from the answering team. If the selected respondent answers correctly then it will score the points as per the number of hands raised or else the questioning team will secure the points as per the number of hands raised by the respondent team. This activity will enhance their vocabulary. BIOLOGY 4 Nature walk- observations The students are divided into two groups and are moved to the school playground. They are asked to observe the pattern of veins on the leaf and the type of root of different plants. Once the students return to the class they are asked to note down their observations in a table- Plant Pattern of veins Kind of root Venn Diagram (Compare and Contrast) The students will be asked to 'Compare and contrast' between Reticulate and parallel venation. They will sit in groups of five and draw the diagram of types of venation and roots. (AHAA moment.......Students will be able to find the type of root in a plant without taking out the plant by simply looking at the pattern on the leaf) PHYSICS 5 Password The facilitator will show an arrangement containing electric wires, electric bulb, electric cell and ask the students to guess the word.

How should sewage be disposed? Math 2 Graffiti Board; Independent/Guided Practice Perimeter and Area. The facilitator would ask the children to think how to paint the classroom if the door is to be left and only the walls to be whitewashed? The students here would be left to think for sometime, discuss and then arrive at the conclusion. What all other real-life examples can be generated? The learners will be asked to note down some areas where they can utilize this learning. These examples will be put up on the Graffiti board and more ideas added till the end of the chapter based on the concept of area and perimeter in various fields. (Anticipated AHAA moment: the students will use this knowledge at homes too and find the areas where perimeter and area are used)Joyful Integration of Subjects : Exemplars83Chemistry 3 Laboratory Visit Visit to the school lab to check for Acid, bases and salt and their reactions under the guidance of the facilitator. Math 3 Hands-on The facilitator will ask the students to bring bread/cut-out (similar to a parallelogram. It will be cut into two triangles and the area measured by taking the formulae \u00bd *base* altitude. Then it will be multiplied by two and area of the parallelogram worked out. They will check for accuracy. They will also check the same considering the bread as a rectangle and check the difference (Anticipated AHAA moment: The students will find that the measure of the parallelogram can be found by combining the areas of two triangles. They will also come to know that if the area of parallelogram and that of a rectangle will be similar or not) Geography 5 KWL The facilitator asks the students to collect a few things like sand, pebbles, an old transparent box, few objects that can used as huts and recreate how a Tsunami occurs. From this, she will ask the children, a. What do you observe? b. What do you know? c. What did you learn from the experiment? d. What more would you like to know? Biology 5 Bundling/ TPS(Think-pair-Share) The facilitator asks students to individually list down ten things as waste that can be categorized under three broad heads 1. Can't be reused 2. Can be recycled and reused (non-biodegradable) 3. Can be used again and again (biodegradable) This list is to be compared in a group of two and bundled. Students are then required to find which waste in generated the most by listing which items they use the most at home. A bird's eye view of the waste generated and disposed is formed. This will give an idea of the areas where waste can be reduced.Handbook of Joyful Learning845.7.2.

Implementation of lesson plan -Stage 1 Subject Day Learning Engagement Hindi 1Throw the ball followed by picture reading) Chapter 3 The Glimpses of the past The facilitator will form heterogeneous groups of 4-5 children each and will throw a ball randomly towards each of the groups. The learners who catch it will come and pick a card from a bowl which contains number 1 to 9. A theme is mentioned on each card. The themes are taken up from the chapter \"The Glimpses of the past\". In this way all the groups will get a theme from the chapter. Each group will read the picture given to them, discuss and write their interpretation of the same as a whole. (Day 1 will make the children understand that changes can be seen almost in all the aspects of the society.) History 2 Chapter 8 Women caste and reform The facilitator will ask the students to show the life of women in the last five decades on a timeline. It will a group activity where each group will present one timeline. Based on the timelines, the facilitator will start the discussion followed by the reading of the chapter in the form of a dictogloss. History (Dictogloss)2 Chapter 8 Women caste and reform Timeline will be followed by dictogloss where the facilitator will read the chapter and students will listen and note down the key findings as a group. (The teacher might read text twice if required). Science, Force and Pressure2 (Brainstorming) Science : Force and Pressure The facilitator will show few pictures to the learners and will ask Joyful Integration of Subjects : Exemplars91 them to reflect on it as far as the word \"CHANGE\" is concerned. In case , the pictures are not available , the facilitator will give ask questions probing questions which will make them conclude that some changes are natural changes like (infant to adult , seed to flower and some changes occur when some external force is applied to them. E.g. kicking a football , pushing and pulling bring a change in the position of objects) Science, Force and Pressure2 (DRTA - Direct Reading and Thinking Activities) The facilitator will give one topic to each group of 4-5 students to read and think and discuss on it. The facilitator will trigger students thinking to relate FORCE with real life. The discussion will range from force required to push /pull a chair to the force required to lift a car with a crane. Each group then presents it to the whole class and makes notes of it. Day 2 : Learning engagement 5 - (Blindfolded in pair - touch and feel) Math :Visualizing solid shapes Two children will be made blindfolded. Blindfolded pair of children will be made to touch an object from different sides (TOP, SIDE,BACK, BOTTOM) but not as a whole and will be asked to guess the shape of those sides as square,rectangle, circle etc.) . Further they will be asked to guess the object. They might guess it same or different depending on their perception. The facilitator can use the objects available in the class or she can arrange it from elsewhere also. It will be an anticipated AHAA moment for the children as they will feel great if both the children guess it correct and they all will enjoy it also. A discussion followed by this activity will make them understand that when they touched the object, it appeared to be 2D but actually it was a 3D object. Discussion on 2D &3D shapes.

The facilitator will make children perform simple experiments with the help of balloons and water, so that they deduce the facts about pressure. Facilitator will ask few probing questions also so that learners deduce the facts of pressure. Why water balloons hurt more when thrown from a greater height? Why water guns have small holes and not 5 Dictogloss Hindi : fpfV~B;ksa dh vuwBh dgkuh The class will be divided into groups of 4-5 students each. Dictogloss will be followed by the group wise presentation the next day. Math 5 My side n view Math : Chapter 10 : Visualising solid shapes The facilitator will distribute a small card silently with either 6 or 9 written on it in the class and will ask the students to read the digit written on it. Some of them will read it as 9 and others will read it as 6. The facilitator will discuss the reason for different answer and will conclude that our opinion is based on our side/perception. The students will be asked to think on this at home 6 9 Related exercises in the notebook. History 5 (DRTA - Direct reading and thinking activities) Women Caste and Reform As the facilitator takes the chapter through DRTA , the learners are involved in active thinking (The facilitator will prepare the learners to make connections between the force required for the changes / reform in the society and the force required bringing a change in the position of objects.Handbook of Joyful Learning94Science 5 Told us ....Made us wonder Force and Pressure The facilitator will give one situation as mentioned below and ask learners to reflect on it as far as force and pressure are concerned After the discussion the facilitator will make them sit collaboratively (heterogeneous groups) and ask them to mention atleast 5 such situations where they observe the difference in the impact as force and pressure are applied. Students will be given a choice to do it in the form of drawing, text, performing art/role play. They will also show it in a tabular form. Told us Made us wonder This will be an anticipated AHAA moment as students will enjoy making connections and sharing the same in the class. English 5 Macavity - The Mystery Cat Recitation and discussion of the poem followed by an activity \"Perceiving it ...my way\" where the learners will be asked to write / enact on the possible ways the mystery cat would have behaved in different situations. (This is an anticipated AHAA moment as the session will be witty, humorous and completely joyful for the students.) Science 6 (Brainstorming) Science :Friction Why is heat produced when we rub our hands? Have you ever thought that why vehicle slows down when brakes are applied? Why is it difficult to walk on a smooth and wet floor? Why do we fall when we step on a banana peel? What causes wear and tear of tyres of moving vehicles? Why are wheels used to move heavy luggage easily? The facilitators will form groups and asked children to brainstorm on the above probing questions. Followed by the brainstorming session the facilitator will ask each group to share their findings with the other groups. Joyful Integration of Subjects : Exemplars95Hindi 6 vkfn Math 6 Brainstorming) Math : Visualizing Solid Shapes Related exercises in the lab. Through discussion the facilitator will also emphasize that what we see is depends on our perception also. E.g.when it rains, some of us feel very happy while few of us feel as if the sky is sad and crying today. The facilitator will throw a question: Playing mobile games is ok for us as children but our parents do not like it. Why? History 6 Dictogloss The Making of the National Movement: 1870s--1947 Dictogloss will be followed by a discussion. The discussion will make the children understand the need and progression towards nationalism. They will be asked to show it on a timeline/flowchart collaboratively. History 7 The Making of the National Movement: 1870s--1947 Dictogloss will be followed by a discussion. The discussion will make the children understand the progression towards different movements which led to independence. The learners will also realize the reforms/movement resulted in the CHANGE in the mindset of the people which started from a thought (perceiving things differently and acting accordingly). The learners will share their learning from the chapter visualizing solid shapes where they learned to see things according to our perspective / side and form opinion. It will be an anticipated AHAA MOMENT for them as they will be able to integrate their learning as a whole and relate it with their lives also. Civics 7 Law and Social Justice As students have already read about a constant thing in life which is CHANGE, the facilitator will ask few questions The major social reforms / movements/changes in the society are for the betterment. Do you all agree? E.g. Triple Talaq, Article 370 were the changes wanted by our society since long but they are implemented now. Why? With the help of these probing questions, the facilitator will derive the need of law and justice associated with a change. Hindi 7 tk,xkA Civics 8 Direct Reading & Thinking Activities Law and Social JusticeHandbook of Joyful Learning96Hindi 8 Think pair, share Hindi : tgk\u00a1 ifg;k gS The learners will discuss and write an article on an A4 sheet and put it on the board of the class. The facilitator will encourage the learners to cite such example which they experienced in the society. Integrated projects9-12 Integrated project 1 The learners are asked to observe the pictures given above carefully as a group (collaboratively) (To bring a change in the position of an object, we apply force as we intend to change its position. To change the position correct amount of force is required. Putting pressure at appropriately to perform a certain task as per our requirement is another dimension to it. Friction plays a major role in bringing a change or in completion of a task. Friction needs to be reduced/overcome to perform a task. Based on the above clues and the pictures the learners will reflect upon. It will be an integration of scientific approach of force, friction, pressure and social reforms and changes. . The presentation can be in the form of a role play/ visual art/ video making/ppt/song/poem/article writing/mime/ performing art. The facilitators will facilitate the process so as to bring the best out of their learners. The parents will be invited for the show where children will display / perform their work. It will be in the form of a gallery walk and the show in the auditorium. Parents will be asked to write their feedback after the show which is going to be motivating and encouraging for the students.

As mentioned in the said circular, Competency based teaching and learning can be pursued through various methods which are experiential in nature to make learning joyful. But the closure of the schools due to COVID-19 Pandemic and lack of face to face interaction may pose challenges in adopting varied methods of teaching to achieve the desired level of learning. Therefore, in the context of the present situation and for the long-term development of capabilities and competencies in the learner, such experiential methods need to be adopted which can be easily implemented and focus their efforts on learning and its outcomes. This also means utilizing resources that are around the students when they are at their homes. Kitchen is one such resource. 6.1. The Kitchen is a Laboratory outside School, a Space for Learning: Someone has rightly said, \"the kitchen is a laboratory, and everything that happens there has to do with science. It's Biology, Chemistry, Physics.Also there's History and art; Mathematics and Economics too\".5 This all seems true when we see the components of our kitchens; when we see the spices we taste, the weighing scales we use, the flame of the gas stove that burns in different colours, the firewood we use in the traditional Kitchens, the different types of fuels we use in the Kitchen all will prove that the Kitchen is a Laboratory both the letter and spirit. The biggest and unseen challenge of COVID 19 has given an opportunity to find innovative solutions for learning. The lockdown has redefined the roles of parents and schools. These times have re-discovered and re-established the roles of homes as learning spaces. And even more importantly, it has re-ignited the focus on learning becoming a habit, a lifestyle that is integrated into every aspect of our daily lives, and not just something that can be done only at a school. These lockdown times have given an opportunity of using Kitchen as an interesting space to learn while staying indoors; of utilizing kitchen as a readymade laboratory to learn a plethora of subjects and concepts. Kitchen can be used for the empowerment and wellbeing of individuals and families; for promoting the values of caring, sharing, accepting responsibility, communication, reflection budgeting and planning. It can help learners to envision and uncover those unrealized possibilities and potentials in the familiar domain of their own homes. We shall highlight using kitchen as a learning space, a laboratory in today's time, when the school laboratories are closed. In fact, Kitchen is that space of our home where we gather our energy for the entire day, through the food prepared; where we learn the most important life skills for survival, i.e. cooking; where we also learn Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Technology through classification, organization, quantities, proportions, thermal conductivity, chemical reactions, audits, optimization, hygiene, timing, nutrition, and many more; where we learn about interdependence, collaboration and joy of working with other individuals. 5. https://altonbrown.com accessed on 27.08.2020Kitchen As A Resource For Joyful Learning996.2. Kitchen: A Learning Ground for 21st Century Skills and Competencies: The 21st Century Skills of 4Cs: Critical Thinking, Creativity & Innovation, Collaboration, Communication, IMT: Information Literacy, Media Literacy, Technology Literacy and FLIPS: Flexibility and Adaptability, Leadership and Responsibility, Initiative and Self-Direction, Social and Cross-Cultural Interaction can be developed by working in a kitchen.We shall explain a few of them: Skill Kitchen Activity Critical Thinking, Creativity & Innovation, Collaboration, Communication Mixing and matching different ingredients; learning and applying the sciences behind kitchen processes. Creating new items; working together with parents/ siblings or even alone under the guidance of someone. Social and Cross- Cultural Interaction Learning about cuisines of various states and countries. Problem Solving Creation of new recipes according to the financial condition and family preferences. Responsibility Being a dutiful child, helping parents in various chores of kitchen. Information Literacy, Technology Literacy Digitally researching on various facets related to kitchen; utilizing the internet to access and analyze information. 6.3. Kitchen for Constructivist Learning: Constructivist Learning manifests a learner's construction of new meaning based on his/her experiences. Thus, the two important elements in this process are i) what a learner already knows and believes, ii) ideas and knowledge with which he comes in contact, which amounts to his/her experience. According to Richardson, \"Constructivist pedagogy is thought of as the creation of classroom environments, activities, and methods...that focus on individual students developing deep understandings in the subject matter of interest and habits of mind that aid in future learning.\"6 Everything around a learner provides a learning experience and can be utilized for this. 6.3.1 Kitchen for Experiential Learning: Experiential Learning (EL) is considered to be the most effective pedagogy to ascertain the implementation of constructivism. In an ideal EL cycle, learners experience the following four stages in a sequence: 1) concrete experience; 2) reflective observation; 3) abstract conceptualization; and 4) active experimentation. Bawden (1998) has summarised the EL process as follows: \"The process of learning starts with the immersion of the learner in a concrete experience from which as many observations as possible are gathered and perceptions recorded. This stage of information gathering is then followed by a phase of thinking, during which attempts are made to understand what has been experienced - and sense is made out what has been sensed. This stage is followed, in turn, with plans for action based on the understanding achieved. Finally, the planned action is taken, and as this changes the situation, the whole process is repeated, and more knowledge created.\" 6 Richardson, V . (2003). Constructivist pedagogy. of Joyful Learning100In today's times, when students are at their homes, a kitchen is one such resource that can help in learning through real-life experiences and where multi-sensory experiential learning can happen. Take for example: Cooking engages students at an almost instinctive level; the smells, sounds, sights, textures and tastes excite senses and intellects. The constant action and requisite involvement needs everyone' s participation. Students also engage with forms of knowledge from a wide variety of disciplines (including anthropology, nutrition, economics, biology, ecology, political science, history etc.) to fully understand the cooking processes, and learn how to integrate data and analyze information from diverse source.7 When the schools are not functioning physically, the environments that are in the reach of a student are to be used. Kitchen can be used both for theoretical concepts and practical applications. Beginning from the theoretical basics, look around the kitchen and you will find examples to enhance your conceptual clarity. See various shapes through the utensils about which you learn in your books - the round 'saucer', cylindrical 'belans', spherical 'tawa'; Acids and Bases in the form of cooking items like Lemon, Vinegar, Baking soda, Salt etc.; concept of heat from gas stoves and traditional stoves; history of Mughals through the 'Paranthas and Pooris', geographical and climate, specially of south India, through spices, like Cinnamon etc. specifically found there. And, there can be numerous such examples. Similarly, in a kitchen you learn the practical application of the concept of pressure used to prepare 'chapattis'; concept of matter by observing change of states from liquid to solid converting milk into curd; process of fermentation while preparing batter for crispy dosas, learning vocabulary through the dal glossary. Take a look at the following real-life example: THE DAL GLOSSARY Recently, the Twitter has been quite amused by the 'dal' glossary prepared by a mother for her son during the lockdown; indeed an innovative use of kitchen for languages. This particular example has actually made us realize once again that it all depends upon the perspective; perspective brings about the change, positive or negative. The mother in this particular case has made use of real-life readily available resources, a resource that is found in every house: the kitchen. Kitchen can actually be used in learning multiple subjects. Take a look at the following suggestive list of scholastic and co-scholastic areas that you can learn through your kitchens: 7. https://www.academia.edu/31635366/Cooking_as_Pedagogy_Engaging_the_Senses_through_Experiential_Learning accessed on 28 July 2020 Kitchen As A Resource For Joyful Learning101 Management, Economics, Safety, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Geography, Biology, Life Skills, Values, Co-scholastic Areas (Discipline, Health and Fitness, Art, General Studies etc.), History, Accountancy etc. 6.4. Using Kitchen for Learning: Teachers can plan such learning experiences that enable students to use kitchen for perceiving, understanding, planning and acting. These learning experiences can be in the form of activities for the practical understanding of the concepts given in their books. This can also be embedded with the Arts-Integrated project to be done in the classes 1st to 10th. 6.4.1 Common Objectives for Using Kitchen for Learning : To make learning joyful and experiential To bring stress-free environment to learning To promote the well-being of individuals, families and societies through food and other components and constituents of a kitchen To provide students with opportunities to understand basic human necessities To enable students to understand scientific facts and principles involved in various forms of work. 6.4.2 Principles to be followed by teachers while devising activities for using Kitchen for Learning: Remember that curiosity and observation is the natural characteristic of learners. Through this type of active and engaged learning, students must be inspired to achieve in-depth learning of the subjects they are studying. Activities must enable students to develop their inquisitiveness, creativity, innovation, critical thinking, analysis, collaboration and other 21st century skills, empowering them with the competencies to understand, analyse, evaluate, interpret and innovate solutions for various real life situations. The activity done or planned must be a purposeful activity for the learner . It must not be a stand-alone activity, rather an integrated part of learning. It must assist in reflection and extended learning of the concepts being covered in the curriculum of a subject, It must aid in the acquisition of competencies in the subject concerned. It must offer experience in home activities. Perceiving, understanding, planning and action: all these processes must be covered through the activities planned.
