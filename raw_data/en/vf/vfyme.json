OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence for and against the existence of an association between autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of the medical literature to identify all controlled epidemiological articles examining for an association between ASD and the MMR vaccine. We extracted data from the articles on the characteristics and objectives of the study as well as evidence of an association. RESULTS: Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria.

Ninety-seven students were randomized to either an evidence-based lecture on the benefits of the polio vaccine on population health or a presentation from a visibly affected victim of polio. We compared change in responses to a survey measuring vaccination attitudes between the two groups. The follow-up rate was 73%. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in change in response to any of the survey questions.

Groups that are associated with reduced rates of pedicatic vaccination, such as parents who access naturopathic care, may be particularly vulnerable to this issue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: In March through September 2010, we administered a 26-item cross-sectional survey to 129 adult patients, all of whom were parents with children ?16 years of age, presenting for naturopathic care in Ontario, Canada.

Very limited qualitative research exists, however, on how attitudes towards vaccination develop among healthcare professionals in-training. We explored perspective development among three groups of students: medical, chiropractic, and naturopathic.
