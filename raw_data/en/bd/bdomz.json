Group Apatients received cycle 1 chemotherapy and Group Breceived cycle two tosix chemotherapy. Each group has sixpatients inthis study. Data were collected prior toand at12-hour intervals after chemotherapy was administered, for 72hours (there were seven data collection periods, Time 1toTime 7). Ateach data collection period, acombination ofthe following instruments was used: (a) aDemographic Data Inventory, (b) the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), (c) an adapted version ofRhodes Index ofNausea and Vomiting Scale (RINV), (d) anadapted version ofDodd sSelf-Care Behavior Log (SCBL). Data analysis was conducted bythe Crunch software statistical package, using descriptive and non-parametric statistics and Spearman's correlations. The findings ofthis study corroborated the results ofDodd and Rhodes.

Clinical observations also have shown that for some patients with cancer the side effects oftreatment seemed worse than the disease itself (Cotanch, 1984; Lindsey, 1985; Oberst, 1978; Rhodes, Watson, &Johnson, 1984). Severe NVmay result in extreme patient discomfort and become the source ofpatient refusal offurther courses ofchemotherapy. Insome cases, patients have actually refused potential curative therapy because of NV(Laszlo, 1983). Chemotherapy is acommon prescribed treatment modality inmany types ofcancer, particularly breast cancer. Because ofthe relatively incidence ofbreast cancer, chemotherapy-induced NVisexperienced by asizeable portion ofthe cancer population. According tothe American Cancer Society's report (1987, 1988), breast cancer will occur in 1ofevery 10 females inthe United States atsometime intheir lives, and accounts for 27% ofall cancer infemales. The annual mortality rate of27per 100,000 females has remained essentially unchanged for 50years. Itaccounts for 18% ofSelf-Care Behaviors 3 cancer deaths infemales. onthe report ofDepartment ofHealth, the Executive Yuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.(1985), breast cancer was the second leading site offemale cancer incidence inTaiwan following cervical cancer. The crude incidence rate ofbreast cancer was 9per 100,000 females in Taiwan. Adjuvant chemotherapy has delayed recurrence and improved survival insome patients and Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, and 5-Fluorouracil (CMF) have occur between intravenous treatment (Brown, 1987; Keys, Bakemeier, &Savlov, 1983). The more widely used CME program yielded a75% incidence of NV. Itwas difficult toestimate the number of patients who dropped put oflengthy therapy programs, declined toparticipate in CME adjuvant chemotherapy, orhad therapy postponed beyond the desirable limits (Laszlo, 1983). InJohns Hopkins Oncology Center, Wilcox and associates (1982) determined the incidence ofpost-chemotherapy NVin breast cancer patients receiving CMF adjuvant chemotherapy.Self-Care Behaviors 4. 46(88.5%) and there was astatistically significant relationship between the incidence ofsevereAmong 52patients, post-chemotherapy 52(42%) patients. Ten of52 (19%) patients discontinued CMF adjuvant chemotherapy because of NV. Bonadonna and Valagussa (1981) had suggested that the length ofthe disease-free interval and survival were related to the total dose of CME administered\" (Wilcox etal., 1982). InMeyerowitz and associates study concluded that almost 50% ofwomen (N =35) treated with CMF did not report a complete return topre-treatment quality oflife four years after isgiven frequently onanoutpatient basis over anextended time period (6-12 months), thus patients must assume amajor responsibility for their own care and must have sustained motivation tocontinue the regimen, especially when the treatment produces side effects (Fernsler, 1986). The management ofexperienced side effects iscritically important toprevent and diminish treatment-induced patient morbidity. Dodd has investigated self-care behaviors (SCBs) in managing the side effects ofradiation therapy and chemotherapy incancer patients (Dodd, 1982a, 1983, 1984a, 1984b, 1984c, 1987, 1988, inpress). Rhodes, Watson and Johnson published two studies (1985, 1987) toidentify the patterns of NVinduced bychemotherapy. However, there has been nodocumented research specifically focusing onboth SCBs and NVinchemotherapy patients. The purpose ofthis study was partial replication and extension ofthe studies ofRhodes and Dodd toidentify the SCBs for NVepisodes in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents on anoutpatient basis. Problem Statement The successful cancer chemotherapy depends not only upon developing drugs that are effective against specific cancers, but also upon finding methods ofreducing the adverse consequences ofthese drugs. The decreased qualitySelf-Care Behaviors 6 oflife that results from chemotherapy side effects may, in fact, outweigh the increased quantity oflife gained from the cancer treatment itself. Todetermine the predictors ofpost-chemotherapy NVfor specific antineoplastic duration, amount, anddistress ofthese two symptoms isessential before developing effective management intervention (Rhodes, et al., 1985). Several recent nursing research studies (Dodd, 1982a, 1983, 1984a, 1984c, 1988, inpress) reported the SCBs of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, but these did not focus onthe specific side effects of NV. The occurrence of NVisnotable with cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, assessing cancer patients SCBs for NVneeds tobe investigated. The key questions ofthis study are how breast cancer patients take care ofthemselves when they experience NVinduced bychemotherapeutic drugs, and whether there are significant relationships between the initiation ofSCBs andpatterns ofNV, anxiety level, and demographic variables. Significance Nausea and vomiting are the most frequent and distressing treatment related human responses encountered by cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy. ClinicalSelf-Care Behaviors 7 observations indicate that for some patients the treatment side effects seem worse than the disease (Lindsey, 1985; Yasko, 1985). Cancer treatment can prolong the quantity of patients lives, but decrease the quality oftheir lives. Ifthe patterns of NVcan bedefined, then Ifthe SCBs for NVcan bedetermined, then the most effective nursing interventions can bedesigned and tested toimprove the quality ofpatients self-care. Ifsome significant relationships between theinitiation ofSCBs, patterns of NV, andpatients anxiety level can befound, then several hypotheses might beformulated toenlarge nursing knowledge inthis area. Since the majority ofbreast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are outpatients, they need more capabilities totake care ofthemselves and nurses can enact animportant role inpatient teaching. Orem's self-care deficit theory ofnursing provides the conceptual framework for this study. This theory will bediscussed later.Self-Care Behaviors 8 CHAPTER TWO Literature Review Nausea and Vomiting The relationship between NViswell documented inthe literature. Infact, they are almost always mentioned and defined together asone concept. This association is problematic because NVare separate concepts and forclarity need tobedefined and treated separately &Yasko, 1983). Inthe limited number ofreferences that separate out this concept, nausea has been described asthefirst of three stages ofvomiting: nausea, retching and vomiting. Borison and McCarthy defined nausea as apsychic experience ofhuman beings, accompanied byseveral autonomic features which help tomake nausea measurable. These autonomic features may ormay not vomiting (Borison &McCarthy, 1983). Vomiting isanobjectively quantifiable physiological motor process that can occur without the presence ofnausea. The vomiting act consists typically oftwo phases, namely, retching followed byexpulsion. However, retching can happen separately sothat novomitus isexpelled. The expulsion phase ofvomiting also can occur 1982).Self-Care Behaviors 9 However, there are few valid and reliable instruments that measure thepatient's perception ofnausea and experience ofvomiting asseparate concepts (Rhodes, Watson, &Johnson, 1984). For the majority ofthe studies, investigators developed The availability ofvalid and reliable outcome measures for NV remains aproblem for nursing research. The major problem continues tobeaccuracy ofassessment tools and decreasing the subjectivity Burish, &Brenner, 1983; Cotanch, etal., 1985; Lindsey, 1985). Bryant and Gorton (1982) compared nurses and physicians charting ofside effects ofchemotherapy with cancer patients perception oftoxicity (as recorded onthe questionnaire). Patients (n =30) reported each side effect more frequently than did physicians and nurses. For both groups, the most frequently reported side effect was nausea. Patient self-report of NVmay be amore accurate and clinically applicable assessment methodology. Itisuseful for thequantification ofoutpatient experiences with self-report of NV(Morrow, 1984). Patterns ofNausea and Vomiting Rhodes, Watson and Johnson (1985) described the patterns of NVthat occurred during two consecutive cyclesSelf-Care Behaviors 1O ofchemotherapy within thefirst six months ofinduction chemotherapy. They used Rhodes Index ofNausea and Vomiting Scale Form 1(5items) tomeasure NVin32cancer patients. The findings demonstrated that: (a)patterns of nausea aredifferent than patterns of post-chemotherapy vomiting over 72hours; and (b) there appear tobemore individual differences in post-chemotherapy pattern ofnausea than inthe post-chemotherapy pattern ofvomiting. Innearly all cases, the amount and frequency ofvomiting were the highest for thefirst 12hours following therapy. During the next 12 hours, vomiting amount and frequency were minimal. Within 24hours following therapy, vomiting ceased. This pattern is adramatic contrast tothe nausea pattern observed. Another finding was thepatient's report that nausea frequently persisted for 48ormore hours following ofthe drugs orhad asecond peak onDay 2or 3(Rhodes, etal., 1985). However, this study did not mention the variety ofthepatients diagnoses and was limited in asmall number ofpatients who received each drug protocol and not allpatients were inthe same two cycles that described the relationship between patterns of NVand protocol. This limited generalizability andvalidity of findings.Self-Care Behaviors 11 Adjuvant chemotherapy may beassociated with ananxiety state which appears &Westling, Sparks and Spears (1979) interviewed 50women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for Stage IIbreast cancer and found 88% of the women reported feeling \"sick\" and nauseated atleast some ofthe time while on CME chemotherapy, and half of these women experienced nausea regularly for the entire two weeks oftreatment. They also reported ahigh incidence of anxiety and psychiatric morbidity among breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Rhodes and associates (1986) designed astudy to describe the relationship ofanxiety to NVthat occurred during consecutive cycles ofchemotherapy. The Spielberger's State andTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Rhodes Index ofNausea and Vomiting Form 2were administered to 36adults who were followed for 1-5 consecutive cycles of initial antineoplastic chemotherapy. The results ofthis study were: (a) State anxiety the morning after chemotherapy was significantly higher than state anxiety prior to chemotherapy for cycle 2through 5;(b) There were no significant differences inpre-chemotherapy state anxiety scores across three cycles oftherapy; (c) There were no significant differences inpost-chemotherapy state anxietySelf-Care Behaviors scores across three cycles oftherapy; (d) Apattern of positive correlations was found fortrait anxiety and pre-chemotherapy state anxiety for cycle 2through 5;(e) there appear tobeprotocol specific differences instate anxiety patterns. The findings ofthis pilot study were also limited bysmall number ofpatients who received each drug protocol. The results should not begeneralized to other samples. However, these investigators mentioned that there may befew direct relationships between anxiety and NV. Instead, the relationship may bebetween anxiety and self-care with asecondary relationship between self-care and symptom distress (Rhodes, Watson, &Johnson, 1986). Rhodes and associates (1987) also published another larger study using self-regulation theory todescribe patterns of NVoccurrence anddistress that emerged during consecutive cycles ofselected initial antineoplastic chemotherapeutic drug regimens. Astratified sample of patients (N =309), ages 20-84 years, were selected from multiple geographic sites intwo mid-western states. The Rhodes Index ofNausea and Vomiting Form 2was used to measure post-chemotherapy NV. Findings revealed that for 84% ofthe sample, vomiting was well controlled 48hours post-chemotherapy, while 7.1% hadlittle ornonausea. In the remaining sample, three distinct antiemetic drug resistant patterns emerged for each ofthese dyad symptoms.12 kSelf-Care Behaviors 13 There were 43patients (13.92%), who were receiving CME antineoplastic drug protocol. Their nausea patterns as Rhodes etal. identified were 40patients experienced \"Minimal Nausea Pattern, \"two experienced \"Latent Nausea Pattern, \"one experienced \"Intense Nausea Pattern\" and none experienced \"Peak Nausea Pattern.\" All these patients (n = 43) experienced a\"Minimal Vomiting Pattern.\" Nopatients experienced \"Latent Vomiting Pattern, Pattern\" (Rhodes, Watson, Johnson, Madsen, &Beck, 1987). Palmer (1987) tested the effect ofpre-chemotherapy patient education and support onthe pattern of NVin41 cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy for the first time. Alongitudinal experimental design was used to test the efficacy of apatient teaching intervention designed todispel misconceptions and provide self-care interventions for the control ofNV. The subjects received avariety ofchemotherapeutic drugs. Data analyses failed tosupport the hypotheses that patients who received pre-chemotherapy patient education showed asignificant reduction inthe frequency, duration, of NVattributed tochemotherapy asmeasured bythe Rhodes Index ofNausea and Vomiting and the Adapted Symptom Distress Scale. Additional findings did reveal some difference when considering diagnosis and chemotherapy.Self-Care Behaviors 14 Twenty-one of41 (51%) patients were diagnosed with breast cancer anditwas observed that the nausea, vomiting, and symptom distress experienced bythese patients atcertain time periods was less than patients with other diagnoses. Also 19ofthe 21breast cancer patients who received CME chemotherapy, showed significantly less NVand symptom distress during 6-12 hours after chemotherapy than other patients (Palmer, 1987). The pattern of NVinbreast cancer patients receiving CME chemotherapy warrants further research. Self-Care Behaviors (SCBs) Kennedy, Packard, Grant, and Padilla (1981) conducted a survey using both nurses (n =64) and cancer patients (n = 115) assubjects toidentify the interventions nurses recommended toprevent orreduce the drug-related NV, and to identify the interventions patients used torelieve NV. Patients and nurses identified antiemetics (53%), distraction (14%), and specific foods (12%) asthe three most effective approaches torelieve NV. Patients (40%) reported the time ofoccurrence of NVasbefore and immediately following treatment. Fernsler's descriptive study compared patient and nurse perceptions ofpatients self-care deficits associated with cancer chemotherapy inanoutpatient setting. An open-ended, semi-structured interview schedule constructedSelf-Care Behaviors 15 bythe investigator, was used toelicit data from 30 patients and their assigned registered nurses. Subjects verbatim responses were classified according tothe categories ofuniversal self-care requisites developed by Orem (1985, pp.90-91). Of 122classifiable responses, 75 were from patients and 47were from nurses. Patients generally perceived more self-care deficits than nurses in the categories that included problems with physical side effects oftherapy. The finding inthis study that one-fourth ofthe self-care deficits were associated with food and water supports previous findings that many patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy experience problems with appetite, nausea, and vomiting (Fernsler, 1986). Dodd has conducted aseries offive self-care studies incancer patients undergoing either chemotherapy or radiation therapy (Dodd, 1982a, 1983, 1984a, 1984b, 1984c, 1987, 1988, inpress). study (Dodd, 1982a, 1983, 1984a) was todetermine (a) whether patients (N =48) practice self-care; (b) whether patients instructed inside-effect management techniques (SEMT) would adopt these techniques; and (c) whether information onSEMT, given alone orincombination with other (e.g. drug) information, would enhance self-care activities tomanage the experienced side effects ofchemotherapy. The patients reported anaverage of7.69 side effects they hadSelf-Care Behaviors 16 experienced but only anaverage of.81 SCBs they had initiated with anaverage effectiveness rating of3.O5 on a five-point scale. The side effects with the greatest frequency were NVreported by 83% ofpatients. Patients initiated self-care most frequently for NV(50 SCBs) were reported. The SCBs most frequently initiated for alleviation of NVwere taking aprescribed antiemetic and drinking acarbonated beverage. The findings supported the belief that SCBs can belearned. Analyses ofcovariance demonstrated asignificant difference inaverage SCBs performance scores between patients who received SEMT information and those who did not [F(1,44) =7.60, p<.O11. Before interventions, there was asignificant positive ofside effect andinitiation ofself-care p= .OO7). This tobestatistically not receive SEMT information (r. =.41, p= .O4) (Dodd, 1983). The limitations ofthis study were the multiple diagnostic categories and chemotherapy protocols, and small sample size. The strength was data collectors were blind to the treatment conditions the patients had been randomly assigned to. The second study onSCBs was focused onbreast cancer patients (N=30), who were initiating their first course of chemotherapy. These patients recorded in alog developed by\u00baSelf-Care Behaviors 17 Dodd the side effects oftreatment they were experiencing and the preventive self-care activities they undertook. The data were obtained bytwo interviews six toeight weeks apart. Potential moderator variables measured were the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Multidimensional Health Locus ofControl and thepatients perception ofthe purpose for chemotherapy. The four most frequently recalled potential side effects ofchemotherapy were nausea, loss ofhair, vomiting, and mouth sores. The average number ofinitiated SCBs thepatients reported was .9. The mean state anxiety score and mean trait anxiety score for thefirst interview were 36.3 (SD =10.1), and 34.8 (SD =7.8), respectively. There was asignificant negative relationship between state anxiety scores atthefirst interview and preventive self-care activity (r. =-.41, p=.O46) (Dodd, 1984c). The strength ofthis study was toreplicate and extend the findings ofearlier research studies; tolimit the sample toone type ofmalignancy; and tohave the patients record their SCBs in aSelf-Care Behavior Log (SCBL) during the 6-8 weeks study instead ofrelying onrecall asin earlier studies. The findings revealed anoverall average of1.6 (SD =.94) SCBs. There was asignificant positive correlation between the patients ratings ofseverity of side effects and their delay ininitiating SCBs (r. =.5, p= .025). The breast cancer patients cited themselves mostSelf-Care Behaviors 18 frequently (60%), then the physician (25%), and lastly the nurse (7%) and the family (7%) asthe source ofself-care information. The average severity rating ofthe experienced side effects was 3.1 (SD =.5); and the average distress rating was 3.0 (SD =.6)both were rated on afive-point scale. The breast cancer patients rating ofthe severity and distress ofexperienced side effects were significantly related (r. =.65, p= .OO2). The decrease instate anxiety was significant [t(29) =2.20, p=.04] between the two interviews. There was asignificant positive relationship between the state anxiety scores atthe second interview and the overall management of SCB ratio (r. =.46, p=.29) (Dodd, 1988). Dodd designed her third longitudinal descriptive study SCBs for the side effects ofradiation therapy (Dodd, 1984b). Thirty patients, who were initiating their first course ofradiation therapy, were taught how tolog the side effects ofthe treatment they experienced and the self-care activities they undertook. The findings ofthis study corroborate those ofanearlier one ofpatients in chemotherapy. Patients reported experiencing anaverage of 3.3 side effects andinitiating few (mean =1.6, SD =.80) self-care activities. The most frequently initiated SCBs in experiencing nausea were totake Compazine, sit down and rest, ordrink 7-up. Anonrandomized sample with variousSelf-Care Behaviors 19 diagnosis and treatments before radiation therapy limited the generalizability ofthe findings. In1987, Dodd published her fourth study onSCBs in cancer patients. The purpose ofthis quasi-experimental study (N =60) was totest the efficacy ofside effect management technique (SEMT) information ifpresented proactively. Three self-administered instruments were used: (a) SCBs, measured actions recorded inthe SCBL, (b) Anxiety, measured Control, measured bythe Cancer Health Locus ofControl (CHLC) scale. Three hypotheses were posed. Thefirst hypothesis stated that patients who received the proactive SEMT information would report more SCBs that prevent potential side effects and that alleviate experienced side effects ofradiation therapy than would the control group patients. The second hypothesis stated that patients who received proactive SEMT information would initiate SCBs with less delay when aside effect occurred than would control patients. The third hypothesis stated that patients who received proactive SEMT information would initiate SCBs before anexperienced side effect became more severe and distressing, unlike control patients, who would wait until alater stage. The findings only supported thefirst hypothesis inpart. The most frequently initiated SCBs for nausea totake antiemetic agent, rest, and the confounding ofkeeping the SCB log onthe delay pattern ofinitiating self-care activities. The fifth study onSCBs incancer patients had the same research design but for chemotherapy patients (N=60) conducted byDodd (inpress). Results only showed that the first hypothesis was supported. Patients who received the proactive SEMT information reported significantly higher four SCB ratios than did the control group patients [t(58) = 2.18-2.50, p=.O15-034). The variables ofanxiety and control were not significantly associated with the SCB ratios. Patient, who received SEMT information, reported a significantly lower state anxiety score during the study period. The average state anxiety score was 43.3 atthe )(Dodd, inpress). Theoretical Framework The theoretical bases for this study was provided by pathophysiological theories which describe the phenomena of NVand Orem's Self-Care Deficit conceptual model. Pathophysiological Theories NVare natural homeostatic protective system which helps riditself ofnoxious stimuli and substances. Utilizing anegative feedback mechanism, sensors atvarious locations inthe body, when stimulated,Self-Care Behaviors 21 send afferent nerve impulses to acentral area (Needleman, 1987). The vomiting islocated inthe &McCallum, emesis isrelated to the intensity ofthe emetogenic stimulus. The reflex is coordinated bythe vomiting center and sights, seasickness, and (Beyer & Dudas, 1984). The CTZ may beactivated bychemical stimuli ineither the blood orcerebrospinal fluid. One postulated mechanism ofvomiting states that vomiting after chemotherapy ismediated through the vomiting center and frequently appears toinvolve the CTZ. Asecond postulated mechanism ofchemotherapy-induced vomiting is stimulation from the pharynx and gastrointestinal tract byafferent impulses transmitted via the vagus and sympathetic nerves tothe vomiting center. It has been that these Athird postulated mechanism for vomitingSelf-Care Behaviors 22 involves afferent impulses from supramedullary loci that may produce emesis and anticipatory vomiting. Thus, there are three primary pathways believed todirect afferent impulses tothe vomiting perceive side effects associated with chemotherapy (Todres, Wojtiuk, 1979). Inparticular, anxiety had been suggested tobe animportant in anticipatory NV(Rhodes etal., 1986). The conscious perception ofdiscomfort (i.e. nausea) associated with vomiting from any causes was acerebral function, asmust also bethe origin of\"anticipatory emesis\" orconditioned vomiting. Itwas already apparent that the psychological conditioned element ofchemotherapy-induced vomiting could betreated as aseparate phenomenon from the immediate pathophysiological response tochemotherapy (Borison & McCarthy, 1983). Rhodes and associates (1987) have found statistically significant relationships between post-chemotherapy symptom experience (for nausea and vomiting) and antineoplastic drug protocol (Rhodes, Watson, Johnson, Madsen, &Beck, 1987). conceptual her self-care deficit theory ofnursing as ageneral theory and several ofthe studies presented earlier have used Orem smodel as abases for their investigations inthe cancer population. Orem defined self-care asdeliberate action and learned behavior. Orem also mentioned that understanding self-care asdeliberate action with internal and external orientations isimportant for nurses. The four types ofexternally oriented self-care actions include the following: (a) knowledge-seeking action sequences, (b) assistance- and resource-seeking action sequences, (c) expressive interpersonal actions, and (d) action sequences tocontrol external factors. The two types ofinternally oriented self-care actions include the following: (a) resource-using action sequences tocontrol internal factors and (b) action sequences tocontrol oneself (thoughts, feelings, orientation) and thereby regulate internal factors orone sexternal orientations (Orem, 1985, p.110). From anursing point areSelf-Care self-maintenance self-regulation through atype ofaction term self-care means care that isperformed byoneself for oneself when one has reached astate ofmaturity that is enabling for consistent, controlled, effective, and purposeful action (Orem, 1985, p.39). Orem istofocus onthe \"maintenance of self-care activities individuals continuously need to sustain life and health, recover from disease and injury, and cope with their effects\" (Orem, 1980, p.6). The goal of nursing istohelp individuals toachieve good health. The nurse functions as aresource and facilitator in decision-making process ofthe client (Dickson & Lee-Villasenor, 1982). The findings ofDodd's study (1984c) demonstrated that the average number ofSCBs initiated by breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were .9. The deficit ofself-care agency isobvious and nurses need to formulate more interventions. Purpose and Aims The purpose ofthis study using adescriptive longitudinal research design (Brink &Wood, 1983) was to identify the patterns ofSCBs for episodes of NVintwo groups ofoutpatients with breast cancer who were undergoing either cycle 1chemotherapy (Group A)orcycle two tosix chemotherapy (Group B). Considering SCBs are learnedSelf-Care Behaviors 25 behaviors, patients inGroup Bmight have more SCBs than Group A. Ineach group data were collected prior toand at a12-hour interval after chemotherapy was given for atotal of72hours (Time 1through Time 7)(see breast cancer patients; Aim #2: todescribe the frequency, duration and degree of distress from nausea experienced bybreast cancer patients; Aim #3: todescribe the frequency, amount and degree of distress from vomiting experienced bybreast cancer patients; Aim #4: todescribe the nature and NVfrom chemotherapy; Aim #5: ofperceived severity and distress ratings ofthe experienced NVwith the initiation ofSCBs;Self-Care Behaviors 26 Aim #9: todetermine the relationship ofnausea and vomiting scores (both total and subscores) with initiation ofSCBs ; Aim #10: todetermine the relationship ofpotential moderator variables ofanxiety and demographic Variables with SCBs for NV. Aim #11: tocompare two groups ofpatients 1Day 1orDay 8chemotherapy (Group A)with patients receiving their second cycle or more ofchemotherapy (Group B)intheinitiation ofSCBs, patterns of NV, and anxiety level. Operational Definitions The three main variables inthis study are NV; SCBs for NV; andpatients anxiety levels. The instruments used inthis study were: (a) adapted Rhodes Index ofNausea and Vomiting Scale Form 2(R.INV); (b) adapted Dodd's Self-Care Behavior Log (SCBL); (c) Spielberger 'sState and Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (STAI); (d) Demographic Data Inventory (see Appendix B, C, D &E,respectively). Nausea. The awareness ofthe urge tovomit, associated with one ormore ofthe following factors: increased salivation, pallor, tachycardia, and cold sweats which occur more than 15minutes after receiving chemotherapy, as measured bypatient self-report using the RINV scale.Self-Care Behaviors 27 Vomiting. Sudden, forceful ejection ofcontents of stomach through the mouth (Wyngaarden &Smith, 1982). The operational definition the RINV scale. Patterns ofNausea and Vomiting. Patterns are the frequency, duration, amount, and distress of NVprior to (Time 1), at 12hours (Time 2), 24hours (Time 3), 36hours (Time 4), 48hours (Time 5), 60hours (Time 6), and 72hours (Time 7)after chemotherapy administration, asmeasured by the patient self-report RINV scale. Self-Care Behaviors for Nausea and Vomiting. The SCBs are actions initiated bythe patient (family orfriends) to asmeasured inthe ofthe SCBL. Anxiety. Anemotional measured bythe STAI (A-State and/or A-Trait). The A-State scale measures disposition torespond tostressful situations with varying levels ofA-State intensity and the degree ofwhich presenting stimuli are perceived as athreat. The A-Trait ofanxiety proneness.Self-Care Behaviors 28 CHAPTER THREE Methodology Research Design This study used adescriptive longitudinal research design with anonrandomized sample. The replication and extension ofthe studies ofRhodes and Dodd were byadding more data collection period from 48hours to72hours, and focusing on NV. Subject Selection Criteria forparticipation inthis study required that the subjects be: (a) 18years orolder, (b) mentally and physically competent, (c) able tounderstand Mandarin or Taiwanese, and read and write Chinese, (d) diagnosed as having breast cancer, (e) scheduled tobegin orcontinue a course ofchemotherapy, and (f) female. Setting Data collection occurred at amore than 1500-bed private general teaching hospital innorthern Taiwan, Republic ofChina. Breast cancer patients usually were followed bytheir own surgeon after mastectomy. They received the prescription from the surgeon and brought the chemotherapeutic agents tothe chemotherapy room, which was furnished with seven beds and six comfortable chairs. One trained oncology nurse prepared and administered the chemotherapy regimens tothe patients.Self-Care Behaviors 29 Instruments Adapted Dodd's Self-Care Behavior (SCBL). Inthis log, the patient records NVepisodes instead ofall side effects from chemotherapy. The patient indicates the time ofonset and ontwo 5-point Likert scales, the severity (from \"1\" barely noticeable to\"5\" most severe) anddistress experienced (from \"1\" minor annoyance to\"5\" extremely distressing). The patients also record what they doto alleviate NVand the time this activity takes place. The patients perceptions ofthe effectiveness ofeach SCB is obtained onthe from \"1\" not relieved atall to\"5\" completely relieved. Finally, the patient records the sources ofinformation for each SCB. Four ratios were established byDodd toexamine the quantitative variable are excluded since itisnot reasonable toexpect further activity with a high degree ofeffectiveness toalleviate aside effect. 2.Total SCB ratio : Total Total side effects ofeach Overall Management ratio: Total \"highest\" effectiveness rating ofSCBs for each side effect Total number ofexperienced side effects Content validity was established bytwo groups of oncologists and four oncology clinical nurse specialists. The reliability ofthe SCBL was established (Dodd, 1988). Adapted Rhodes INV Form 2is a8-item, 5-point Likert-type self-report pencil and paper that measures the patient's perceived frequency ofnausea, duration ofnausea, and distress from nausea; frequency ofvomiting, amount of vomiting, anddistress from vomiting; frequency ofdry heaves, and distress from dry heaves. The scale ranges from O\"During last 12hours distress from nausea orvomiting\". Cronbach's Alpha was calculated for Form 2with areliability estimate tobe.98. The internal reliability ofthe INV Form determined by using asplit-half procedure and Cronbach's Alpha. Cronbach's Alpha was calculated for 12administrations withSelf-Care Behaviors 31 reliability estimates of .89to.97 (N =25to30). The split half procedure yielded reliability estimates of .83to .99 (n=25to32) with 11ofthe 12administrations yielding reliability estimates greater than .90. Concurrent validity was assessed bycomparing the ratings of chemotherapy patients with ratings offamily members. Correlations using the Spearman Formula were calculated for two separate administrations across 2cycles of chemotherapy. The correlations for thefirst and for the second administration were r=.89 (N =18) and r=.83 (N = 16), respectively. Construct validity was established between groups ofwell citizens (N =72) and chemotherapy patients (N =32) (p=.0003) and was determined byusing the Mann-Whitney Utest (Rhodes, Watson, &Johnson, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987). This tool isreliable and valid inmeasuring post-chemotherapy NVincancer patients. Because the concept ofretching ordry heaves isconfused easily with nausea inChinese, two items related todry heaves were deleted. The adapted Rhodes Index ofNausea and Vomiting (RINV) used inthis study had only 6items (see Appendix B). The total score of NVwas calculated the patients' responses toeach ofthe six RINV; the potential range ofscores was from Oto24; the actual range was 0to21. The nausea subscore was calculated by summing thepatient's was from the actual range was 0to 11. The vomiting subscore was calculated bysumming the patients was 0to11. The nausea subscore inthe RINV included the sum of 3 items: frequency ofnausea, duration ofnausea, and degree ofdistress from nausea. Each item ranged from \"O\" to\"4, \" e.g., for frequency ofnausea, \"O\" represents the statement \"Idid not feel nauseated orsick at mystomach during \"Ifelt orsick at subscore RINV also included the items: frequency ofvomiting, amount ofvomiting, and degree ofdistress from vomiting. Each item was rated from \"O\" to\"4, \"e.g., for amount ofvomiting, \"O\"* represents last 12hours Idid not throw up\"; \"4\" represents the statement \"During the last 12 hours Iproduced avery large (3cups ormore) each (STAI). The STAI consists of two 20-item scales that measure two distinct anxiety concepts, state anxiety (A-State) andtrait anxietySelf-Care Behaviors 33 (A-Trait). The STAI inclinical situations. The A-Trait tool provides ameans for screening subjects for anxiety-proneness and for evaluating the degree towhich subjects are troubled byneurotic anxiety problems. The A-State tool measures the level oftransitory anxiety and evaluates feelings oftension, nervousness, worry, and apprehension. The items are measured on afour-point Likert self-report scale ranging from 1(not atall) The range ofpossible scores oneach subscore is 20to80. Reliability data range from .16to.54; alpha coefficient range from .83to.92, typically higher under stress; construct validity, point biserial ranges from .60 to .73. Correlations with other standard trait anxiety instruments have been established; IPAT Anxiety Scale (.75 to .77); Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (.79 to .83); and Affect Adjective Checklist (.51 to .52). Construct validity have been determined bysubjecting participants totesting under stress and non-stress conditions (Spielberger, Gorsuch, &Lushene, 1970). Demographic Data Inventory. The demographic data included age, ethnic background, religious preference, marital status, living arrangement, disease process and treatment, previous experience related tocancer, and Karnofsky's performance status.Self-Care Behaviors 34 The instruments were translated into Chinese. Content validity ofthetranslation was established bytwo oncology clinical nurses from Taiwan who are fluent inChinese and English and are graduates from Master degree atthe University ofCalifornia, San Francisco (UCSF). Human Subjects Assurance The research protocol was approved bythe UCSF Committee onHuman Research (see Appendix N). Questionnaires contained noidentification ofthe individual, and confidentiality ofthe subjects responses was maintained throughout the study. Subject participation was strictly voluntary, with freedom towithdraw atany time. Patients were assured that they would remain anonymous, that noinvasive procedure would occur aspart of the study, that non-participation inthe study would not affect their medical care, and that they would not incur any financial costs from their participation inthe study. Signed consent forms were kept in alocked file cabinet at the investigator's residence (see Appendix F). Procedure Each recruited subject was approached inthe morning to prevent from disturbing her sleep, since data were collected twice aday at12-hour intervals (e.g., 10 Behaviors 35 1.The investigator approached each potential participant togive her verbal and written information about the study. 2.Ifthe patient consented, the following demographic information: diagnosis; age; place ofresidence; antineoplastic and antiemetic drugs ordered including dosage, route, date, and time; and other drugs administered dosage, route, date, and time; were completed byan interview and checking the patients hospital records. 3.The patient was asked tocomplete the RINV (Time 1) and the STAI (Time 1)before orduring the chemotherapy treatment. 4.The investigator, then, gave thepatient apackage ofquestionnaires, including the RINV sheets, State Anxiety Scale and the SCBL, and explained how and when tocomplete each ofthem. 5.While the chemotherapeutic agents were being given, the investigator marked the exact time onthe RINV sheets and asked the patient torespond tothe RINV the evening following chemotherapy treatment (Day 1)and again every 12 hours for 72hours (Time 2through Time 7)(see Appendix A). 6.Inthe morning ofpost-chemotherapy 4(Time 7) the patient was again asked torespond tothe State Anxiety Scale, and tocomplete the last RINV; all questionnairesSelf-Care Behaviors 36 then were put in astamped addressed envelop and mailed to the investigator. Data Analyses Data analysis was conducted bythe Crunch software statistical package (1987). Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney Utest, Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test, and Spearman's rank correlations were used because the sample size ineach group was small.Self-Care Behaviors 37 CHAPTER FOUR Results Description ofSample From June 23toAugust 29, 1987, there were 34breast cancer patients who were approached: Nineteen patients did not meet criterion \"c\" ofsubject selection; 3patients did meet thecriteria but study because they were too busy; 12patients did agree to participate inthe study. There were 6patients inGroup A and 6patients inGroup B. Table 1shows the demographic characteristics ofbreast cancer patients inthe study. All patients were married and lived with their families. Using Mann-Whitney Utest to compare Group Awith Group Bonselected demographic variables found that age (z= .48, and Karnofsky's performance status (z=.93, p<.352) had nosignificant differences; but there were significant differences in educational attainment (z =2.00, p<.045), time since cancer diagnosis (z =2.48, p<.013), and time since surgery (z =2.92, p<.OO4) between the two groups (Table 1). Group Apatients had higher education, their diagnosis and mastectomy were more recent than those inGroup B. In Group A,83.3% (n=5)ofthebreast cancer patients knew that the purpose ofchemotherapy was tocure cancer and shrink the tumor. InGroup B,66.7% ofthe breast cancerSelf-Care Behaviors 38 patients (n =4)were not sure ofthe purpose of chemotherapy. Four patients inGroup A(67%) and 3inGroup B(50%) had one ortwo family members orfriends who had breast orcolon cancer. Those family members and friends all had surgery, but some had combined chemotherapy and radiation; one also was treated with traditional Chinese medicine. None ofthe patients inthis study had received chemotherapy, radiotherapy orhormonal therapy before their current chemotherapy. They all received 5-Fluorouracil 500 mg IVinfusion, Methotrexate 50 mg IVpush, and Cyclophosphamide 50mg/d orally (1-5 mg/kg/d). From the patients perspective, one cycle (28 days) meant that, for thefirst 2weeks, they came tothe clinic atregular intervals (e.g., Day 1and Day 8)toreceive their chemotherapy infusion and their oral prescription (Cyclophosphamide) for 14days. Then, they took a2-week break and came back for the same regimen; this was repeated for another 5cycles. Data obtained inthis study were from Group A,who received cycle 1Day 1orDay 8chemotherapy, and Group B, who received cycle 2ormore chemotherapy (Table 1). Patterns ofNausea and Vomiting (for entire sample) Aim #1. The first aim was todescribe the post-chemotherapy patterns of NVinbreast cancer patients.Self-Care Behaviors 39 Figure 1shows the patterns of NVinbreast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, regardless oftheir cycles. Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks tests found that the mean nausea subscores were larger than the mean vomiting subscores, and there were significant differences between them through all data collection periods except Time 7(z =1.96-2. 37, p= .O18-. O498) (Table 2). The total and nausea subscore peaked at12hours, whereas vomiting peaked at24hours, then declined tobaseline (Time 1). The breast cancer patients post-chemotherapy nausea subscores had insignificant relationships with post-chemotherapy vomiting subscores at the same data collection periods using the Spearman's rank coefficient (r. = \u2014.47-. 52, n=12, p=.122-. NVare proposed tobedifferent concepts. Patterns ofNausea Aim #2. The second aim was todescribe the frequency, duration, and degree ofdistress from nausea experienced by breast cancer patients. Figure 2shows the patterns of nausea reported bythese breast cancer patients. The scores for frequency and duration ofnausea were not Oat pre-chemotherapy, peaked at 12hours period post-chemotherapy, and gradually declined to pre-chemotherapy levels. The distress ofnausea peaked at 24hours.Self-Care Behaviors 4O Patterns ofVomiting Aim #3. The third aim was todescribe the frequency, amount, and degree ofdistress from vomiting experienced by breast cancer patients. Figure 3shows the degree of distress from vomiting, the amount and frequency of vomiting. The frequency ofnausea, duration ofnausea, and distress from nausea were higher than the frequency of vomiting, amount ofvomiting, anddistress from vomiting. Table 4shows that there were significant differences between frequency ofnausea and frequency ofvomiting at 36-60 hours post-Chemotherapy, at24-48 hours post-chemotherapy. There were insignificant relationships between the frequency ofnausea and the frequency ofvomiting, the duration ofnausea and the amount ofvomiting, and the distress ofnausea and the distress of vomiting atall remaining data collection periods. Self-Care Behaviors for Nausea and Vomiting Aim #4. The fourth aim was todescribe the nature and frequency ofSCBs initiated toalleviate the experienced NV from chemotherapy. Inthis study, did notfill out the SCBL completely, 2inGroup Aand 4inGroup B. The remaining breast cancer patients total SCB ratio was 1.21Self-Care Behaviors 41 (SD =1.35), the selected SCB ratio was .93 (SD =1.48), the SCB efficacy ratio was 1.68 (SD =2.22), and the SCB overall management ratio was 2.93 (SD =3.28) (Table 5). The most frequent initiated SCBs toalleviate the experienced nausea were todrink hot water, tea, soup ormilk; rest orsleep; oreatfruit. The SCBs toalleviate the experienced todrink tea, rest, orbriefly exercise. Within 3days post-chemotherapy, the breast cancer patients did initiate one tofour SCBs toeliminate their experienced NVinduced bychemotherapy. Aim #5. was todetermine the relationship ofthe duration ofthe experienced NVwith the initiation ofSCBs. None ofthepatients recorded the exact time they initiated the SCBs for NVintheir logs and data are not available for analyses ofthis study aim. Effectiveness ofSCBs for Nausea and Vomiting Aim #6. The sixth aim was todetermine the patient's perceived effectiveness ofinitiated SCBs for NV. The mean SCB efficacy ratio was 1.68 (SD =2.22) on a5-point scale. Breast cancer patients did initiate some SCBs toalleviate their post-chemotherapy NV, but they rated the effectiveness ofthese SCB's rather low. Sources ofIdeas for SCBs Aim #7. seventh aim was toidentify thepatient's sources ofideas for SCBs. Four breast cancer 42 (33.3%) cited themselves asthe source oftheir SCB ideas. These SCBs included taking anap drinking hot soup, water ortea; eating alittle bit ofsugar-cured fruit to alleviate the NV. Two patients (16.7%) cited their husbands asthe source ofthe SCB information. Suggestions included giving aback massage ordrinking milk. Another patient reported that her mother-in-law suggested toher todrink a glass ofmilk toalleviate discomfort. Not surprisingly, no patients cited nurses orphysicians asresource persons in the alleviation of NV. Relationship between Severity and Distress of NVand SCBs for NV Aim #8. The eighth aim was todetermine the relationship ofperceived severity and distress ratings of the experienced NVwith the initiation ofSCBs. Nodata were available for the severity and distress of NVinSCBL. However, the degree ofdistress from NValso were rated in the RINV scale. Spearman' scorrelation between distress of NVand four SCB ratios found nosignificant relationships between perceived distress from NVand the four SCB ratios. Relationship between SCBs for NVand RINV Scores Aim #9. The ninth aim was todetermine the relationship of NVscores (both total and subscores) with SCBs (4ratios). Nosignificant relationships between any ofthe four SCB ratios and the RINV total scores, nausea\u00baSelf-Care Behaviors 43 subscores, and vomiting subscores atany ofthe seven data collection periods were found onthe entire sample. Ofthe four SCB ratios, only the SCB efficacy ratio and SCB overall management ratio showed asignificantly negative relationship (Spearman's correlations) the RINV chemotherapy, the higher scores ofthe RINV they had, the lower SCB ratios inmanagement and efficacy. Aim #10. The tenth aim was todetermine the relationship ofpotential moderator variables asanxiety and demographic variables with SCBs for NV. Relationship between Anxiety and SCBs for NV. There was one missing data point onthe state anxiety score post-chemotherapy inGroup B. Spearman's correlations between all four SCB ratios and State and Trait Anxiety scores inthis study were not significantly correlated. Relationship between Demographic Variables and SCB for NV. Spearman's correlations between the four SCB ratios and selected demographic variables (age, education, time since cancer diagnosis, time since surgery, and Karnofsky's performance status) were computed. Nosignificant relationships between them were found. InGroup A,the SCB efficacy ratio and SCB overall management ratio wereSelf-Care Behaviors 44 positively .O35; r=.99, n=4,p=.OO9, Itmeant patients receiving initial chemotherapy, the more education attainment they had, the more manageable and efficient SCBs. Comparison between Group Aand Group B Aim #11. The eleventh aim was tocompare the two groups ofpatients receiving Cycle 1Day 1orDay 8 chemotherapy (Group A)and those patients receiving their cycle 2ormore chemotherapy (Group B)inSCBs, patterns of NV, and anxiety levels. Self-Care Behaviors. Table 5shows all means offour SCB ratios inGroup Bwere higher than Group A. However, Mann-Whitney Utest found that there were nosignificant differences between Group Aand Group Binthe RINV Scores. Figure 4, 5, and 6shows Group Bwas higher than Group AonRINV total scores, nausea subscores, and vomiting subscores atall data collection periods. Using Mann-Whitney Utest, there were significant differences between Group A(n=6)and Group B(n=6)in total score Group Bin vomiting subscores atall data collection periods were found (Table 6). There were significant differences between mean nausea subscores and mean vomiting subscores were no significant differences between the subscores inGroup A (Table 2). State Trait Anxiety Scores. Inthis study the breast cancer patients mean state anxiety score pre-chemotherapy was 47.83 (SD =9.65), the mean trait anxiety score was 44. O8 (SD =9.55). The patients mean state anxiety score post-chemotherapy inGroup Awas higher than their pre-chemotherapy score, but this difference was statistically not significant. For Group B,the mean state anxiety score post-chemotherapy was lower than their pre-chemotherapy score, but this difference was statistically insignificant (Table 7). Nosignificant relationships between state anxiety scores pre-chemotherapy and state anxiety scores post-chemotherapy, and thestate anxiety score andtrait anxiety score pre-chemotherapy were inGroup Aand Group B. Mann-Whitney Utest also found nosignificant differences between Group Aand (z = .27, p< ..748).Self-Care Behaviors 47 CHAPTER FIVE Discussion The findings ofthis study partially corroborated the research studies ofDodd (1984c, 1988) and Rhodes etal (1985, 1987). Itcontributes to abetter understanding of breast cancer patients SCBs for chemotherapy induced NV. SCBS for NV The average number ofSCBs for NVinitiated bythe cancer patients inthis study was 1.21 (SD =1.35). Itwas lower than the overall average of1.6 (SD =.94) SCBs inDodd's findings (1988). The SCB efficacy ratio (M = 1.68, SD =2.22) was also lower than inDodd's study (M = 3.O, SD =1.4). Nopatients mentioned nurses orphysicians astheir resource persons inthe study. Therefore, more nursing interventions andpatient education are needed to alleviate chemotherapy side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, inbreast cancer patients. The pattern ofSCBs was very similar between this study and Dodd sstudies. Patients used home remedies, however Dodd's samples used more antiemetics. Also mentioned Group Bwere more active intheir self-care, apparently the repeating cycles ofchemotherapy increased NVand provided the stimulus for more SCBs. Patterns of NVSelf-Care Behaviors 48 Patterns of NVinthis study supported the findings in the studies ofRhodes, Watson and Johnson (1985, 1987). The patterns ofnausea and the patterns ofvomiting are two different phenomena. The most severe NVwere at 12hours and 24hours post-chemotherapy. This reflects higher drug doses inthe blood and these gradually decreased. Patients receiving more than one cycle ofchemotherapy experienced significantly more frequent, duration, amount, anddistress - *. from nausea and vomiting which may suggest that these side effects are cumulative. Also the destress from nausea took time todeveloped i.e.,itpeaked at24hours. Similarly, vomiting peaked later than nausea. Anxiety Levels Inthis study the breast cancer patients mean state anxiety score and mean trait anxiety score pre-chemotherapy were higher than Dodd's finding (1988) [36. 3, (SD =10.1) for state anxiety and 34.8 (SD =7.8) fortrait anxiety at thefirst interview )and Rhodes finding (1986) [40 (SD = 8.5) for state anxiety before chemotherapy). The reason might belack ofinformation and support system inTaiwan to cope with disease process and side effects oftreatment. Y However, itwas lower than the findings ofScott (1983). \u00ba The STAI has been used in asample biopsy (N=85). reported =10; state) atthe time ofbiopsy. Breast cancerSelf-Care Behaviors 49 patients anxiety level may berelated todiagnosis, disease process, and reactions oftreatment. Further investigation inthis area needs tooccur. Environmental factors also influenced these breast cancer patients perceived severity of NV. For example, it was easy toobserve that the patients were influenced by each other 'sreactions when they felt nauseated orvomited inthe same room. Since the chemotherapy room islarge, with noseparation between beds and chairs, patients can observe and communicate with each other. Once, when one patient had severe NVafter antineoplastic drugs had been administered, some ofthe patients inthe room were affected. Few physicians prescribed antiemetics for the breast cancer patients. Itmight betheir nausea and vomiting not sosevere orpatients did not complain totheir physician. One breast cancer patient felt nauseated and received her antiemetics. However, she told methat antiemetics made her feel sicker, soshe threw them away. Another issue which might influence NViswhether antiemetics are appropriately prescribed and taken bythe patients. This question needs further investigation. Patients ingroup A,who were receiving their chemotherapy for thefirst time, behaved differently inthe chemotherapy room than those patients who had been there before. They usually looked around and observed the entireSelf-Care Behaviors 50 environment. They often asked nurses orother patients questions, possibly tofeel better incontrol ofthe new situation. Incontrast, some ofthe patients who had come tothe chemotherapy room before, tended not tosay anything; usually, but just put the drugs onthe desk and went tothe bathroom. Afterwards, the repeating patients lied down on a bed orsat in acomfortable chair, waiting for the nurse to set upthe intravenous infusion. Some patients mentioned that, assoon asthey stepped inthe building, they felt sick totheir stomach. Some ofthe breast cancer patients were afraid ofthe smell inthe chemotherapy room. For example, one patient covered her nose and mouth with a handkerchief. One patient always wore amask when she came tothe chemotherapy room. Different patients had different coping strategies and SCBs. There were nosignificant relationships between SCBs for NVandpatient sanxiety level inthis study. still need tolearn more about individualized SCBs inorder toestablish and test more effective nursing interventions. Self-report aself-report ofschooling inChinese. However, 40years ago Taiwan was under Japanese control. Most ofthe people did not have achance togotoschool, especially females. Some ofthem learned Japanese only.Self-Care Behaviors 51 The mean age ofbreast cancer patients whom the investigator approached was 44.9 years (N=34); they ranged inage from 28to65years old. They were younger than those breast cancer patients inthe Dodd's study (mean =54.6, SD = 10.43) (Dodd, 1984c., 1988). When the investigator asked them about their educational background, some ofthem mentioned that itwas not easy tosurvive atthat time, let alone tolearn Chinese. This isonly one factor of a complex social andhistorical background which influenced this population. Further, the fact that these self-report instruments are geared towards white middle-class Americans, their administration toChinese patients needs tobetaken into account inthe interpretation ofthe study's findings. Multidisciplinary Approach Acancer center has not yet been established inTaiwan. Most ofthe breast cancer patients are cared for bythe physician whofirst sees them. After mastectomy, the breast cancer patient isstill followed bythe physician inthe surgical clinics, where she also received her chemotherapy treatment. There are seldom referrals between surgical and medical oncologists. Some ofthe patients complained that their surgeons were not concerned about the side effects of treatment (CMF). They complained that they spent awhole morning waiting for the doctor, but that the doctor only gave them less than aminute. Some ofthe patients wereSelf-Care Behaviors 52 afraid that the doctors might beangry with them and not care for them appropriately ifthey had too many requests or questions. They would rather not let their doctors know their distress from treatment even though they were dissatisfied with his care. Some ofthepatients did not know the treatment plan and the side effects ofthe treatment. They only knew they would come back next week to get another treatment. The nurses working inthe clinics also whispered that they felt powerless about patients complaints. They also thought that the doctors were not concerned about the patients physical discomfort and the patients side effects induced bycancer chemotherapy. Since cancer care needs amulti-disciplinary approach, itiscrucial todevelop acollaborative attitude between nurses and medical and surgical oncologists. Using a multidisciplinary approach incancer treatment and side effects management also needs tobestressed. Expanding the role and function ofoncology nurses inpatient education and interventions toalleviate side effects from chemotherapy needs tooccur. Limitations This study islimited bythe self-report instruments, with which the patients were not accustomed. There was no possibility toverify the accuracy ofthese measurements, either byobservation orbyinterview with thepatient 'sSelf-Care Behaviors 53 family inthis study. Also, the sample size was too small ineach group togeneralize findings, even though some of results had statistical significance, these may have occurred due toType Ierror. The reader iscautioned to interpret these findings with care given the small non-probability sample. Recommendations for Future Research Because ofthe convenience sampling, the sample size should belarger and more homogeneous ineach group i.e., receiving the same cycle orprotocol ofchemotherapy. In terms ofthepatient's commitment tothe study (attrition), thefirst interview iscrucial. The investigator should establish good rapport with the patient and carefully explain the instruments tomake sure that the patient understands them. This isespecially important for those whose educational background islimited. Furthermore, when using asurvey toobtain data toprevent problems that may threaten internal validity, such asinterviewer effects and response sets, the interviewer needs toshow interest without revealing what may beconsidered asthe \"right\" response. The use and effectiveness ofantiemetics for NV also needs to bestressed and documented.Self-Care Behaviors 54 References American Cancer Society (ACS) (1987, 1988). Cancer facts and figures.
