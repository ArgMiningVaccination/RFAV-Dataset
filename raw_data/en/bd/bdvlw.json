[Sepsis](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/doctor/sepsis/) is a serious disease that occurs when the body has an exaggerated response to an infection. The immune system, which normally protects the body from illness and infection by releasing chemical and proteins, can go into overdrive and start to damage the body's own tissue. The process can cause a chain reaction throughout the body and cause abnormal organ function and can potentially lead to failure. Sepsis can also be called septicaemia or blood poisoning. There are three stages; sepsis, severe sepsis, and eventually [septic shock](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/septic-shock). Is it a medical emergency? Sepsis is a very serious, life-threatening condition and needs to be treated as a medical emergency. Get medical care immediately, as fast treatment can improve chances of surviving. Most people with mild sepsis will survive if treated promptly. What is the cause of sepsis? Although most cases are caused by bacterial infection, any type of infection, including viral or fungal, can lead to sepsis. It is most commonly caused by the following: [Pneumonia](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/pneumonia) - Abdominal infection [Kidney infection](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/kidney-infection) - Infection of the bloodstream (bacteraemia) - Wounds or burns - Sites of catheters Who is at risk of developing sepsis? People who have a higher risk of developing sepsis are those who: - are 65 and over - have a weakened immune system - have chronic medical conditions, like [diabetes](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/diabetes), lung or kidney disease, or [cancer](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/cancer-treatment) - have recently been ill or hospitalised - are in hospital - have previously survived sepsis - have invasive devices in them, like a [catheter](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/catheter) Pregnant women and children under the age of one are at higher risk. The rise of drug-resistant bacteria also poses a risk of sepsis. Is sepsis contagious? While sepsis itself isn't contagious, the infection that causes it might be. What are the symptoms? The most frequent symptoms of sepsis are: [fever](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/fever) - sweaty skin - increased heart rate and respiratory rate [shortness of breath](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/shortness-of-breath-dyspnoea) [low blood pressure](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/low-blood-pressure) - chills - rashes - extreme pain - confusion - feeling disoriented. If a baby or young child, has discoloured skin, lips or, tongue, a rash that does not fade when a glass is rolled over it, breathing difficulties, a high pitched cry, or changes in eating and sleeping patterns, they might have sepsis and need to be taken to a doctor immediately. In severe sepsis, one or more organs may start failing, which can lead to symptoms such as [abdominal pain](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/abdominal-pain), difficulty breathing, or decreased urination. How is it diagnosed? Diagnosing sepsis is complicated because its symptoms can be vague or confused with those of other conditions, especially in the early stages. A medical assessment needs to be undertaken to confirm whether the patient is suffering from sepsis or not. Doctors will first take a medical history and then perform a physical examination. Different tests and medical examinations will be used for a more precise diagnosis. Common tests used are: [Blood tests](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blood-tests/): the aim of these is to look for: - Signs of infection [Clotting problems](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/blood-clots) - Abnormal liver or kidney function - Decreased availability of oxygen [Electrolyte imbalances](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/electrolyte-disorders) Other laboratory tests: depending on the symptoms of each person, the specialist may test: - The patient's urine - Secretions from the wound (if the patient has a visible injury) - Respiratory secretions Diagnostic imaging: if the specialist is unable to identify the site of infection, they may perform one of the following image-based tests. What is the prognosis? The prognosis depends on how long it takes to start treatment. If the condition is diagnosed at an early stage, it can be treated easily with antibiotics. However, if the diagnosis is incorrect and no treatment is given, it can be fatal, since it can quickly develop into severe sepsis or septic shock, which have mortality rates of forty per cent. How is sepsis treated? Aggressive treatment of the infection increases the chances of surviving septicaemia. Most patients with sepsis will be admitted to the hospital. Patients with severe septicaemia or septic shock will be taken to the ICU (intensive care unit), and measures must be taken to stabilise breathing and heart function. The following treatments may be used: - Antibiotics - Fluids delivered intravenously to prevent dehydration - The patient may be given oxygen - Vasopressors to counter low blood pressure - Emergency treatments, such as a blood transfusion, [kidney dialysis](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/dialysis)or mechanical ventilation may be needed in severe cases Who treats sepsis? Intensive care medicine specialists deal with cases of sepsis. Can sepsis be prevented? The main recommendations are to keep the immune system healthy and to have infections treated early, as the risk of sepsis is higher if the immune system is weakened or if there is an infection caused by a variety of pathogens or by very serious pathogens. Preventing infections is the best way to prevent sepsis, so get the recommended vaccines, cover cuts and wounds until they've healed, and wash hands frequently. What complications can arise? Sepsis can lead to septic shock, which can result in potentially fatal problems like organ failure or strokes, due to a drastic drop in blood pressure. Sepsis can advance very quickly. Signs of septic shock are reliance on medication to maintain blood pressure and high levels of lactic acid in the blood. Abnormal [blood clots](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/blood-clots) or burst blood vessels are common complications.
