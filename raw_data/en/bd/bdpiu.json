[Medicinal Plant Index](https://medicinalplantindex.com/), founded this year by Gumbs with the consistent help of Cervantes, is an online space that provides a user-friendly beginner's guide to understanding medicinal herbs and plants\u2014all of which have well-researched health benefits. After creating MPI's digital catalog, Gumbs developed the brand's first official formula, a supplement he is calling Uplift. This supplement is the first of six still to come, each one intended to target a specific need, ranging from lethargy and depression to libido and beauty concerns. After a move to Mexico City from New York, Gumbs started to notice changes in not only his skin but his overall energy, neither of which had been a bother before. With the help of local bot\u00e1nicas (botanical shops), and a natural curiosity for remedies outside of traditional Western medicine, he began to explore herbs in the form of teas, tinctures, and supplements to rebalance himself physically and mentally. \"In a bot\u00e1nica, it's like every herb there is,\" explains Cervantes, \"so we started going to shops with a whole list. Sometimes I was like, 'What is this?' Travis started making formulations at home, and he said to me, 'I wish there was a medicinal database.' So I said, 'Why don't you build one?'\" The couple have long worked together: Gumbs, a photographer, and Cervantes, a director, ran the creative studio Maroon World, which produced fashion editorials and designed merchandise. [MPI](https://www.instagram.com/medicinalplantindex/) presents visitors with its index, a shop, and a journal in which the process behind the plants' medicinal sourcing can be better understood. Gumbs intends to put transparency at the forefront, filling the void of information he didn't have on his own journey to better health. \"My research led me to a ridiculous amount of sites that specialized in very specific or esoteric information. It's what made me realize that a platform for medicinal plant knowledge that was easy to navigate, encompassed various entry points for knowledge seekers (searching a site for herbs that help with anxiety, for instance), and was pleasant to engage with from an aesthetic standpoint was missing,\" says Gumbs. \"A brilliant starting point for anyone seeking to understand more about this industry is [The Business of Botanicals](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Botanicals-Exploring-Medicines-Industry/dp/1603587489). It's an eye-opening look at the behind-the-scenes of how the herbal industry sources and cultivates herbs for mass consumption. I was in the thick of building MPI and producing the final formula for Uplift when I read it, and I can unequivocally say that it informed many of my decisions as I moved forward with MPI,\" he adds. Otherwise, he found inspiration in herbalist Dr. Sebi, traditional Chinese medicine, and Native American medicine. \"I wanted to work with herbs in their [purest] form,\" explains Gumbs. \"My ultimate goal is to travel to each and every location we source plants from; document the culture around each plant; and, ultimately, see how it arrives to consumers.\" MPI's Uplift supplements are a combination of five adaptogenic herbs and two types of sea moss. With every formula, consumers can explore an [ingredient section](https://medicinalplantindex.com/product/uplift/) accompanied by an illustration to identify each herb or plant. MPI sources whole herbs from certified organic or wild-crafted suppliers; they might come from indigenous lands in Costa Rica or local farms in California. In 2019 Gumbs and Cervantes welcomed a child together. The family dynamic has proved to be a motivation for MPI. \"I am really compelled by this idea that we're trying to change the health narrative in our own families and for our family and our child,\" says Gumbs. \"Moving forward, we [want to] shift the way people think about health and who it belongs to.\" The couple has found one way to connect with and preserve Indigenous, African, and Latinx traditions and beliefs through holistic medicine. As the number of people gravitating toward [alternative medicine](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/complementary-alternative-medicine-market) grows, the need for knowledge grows with it. \"We are pulling resources from our culture to figure out a way for us to take control of what we consider healthy, in our minds and then the body,\" Gumbs and Cervantes explain. MPI is here to bridge the gap in what Gumbs describes as a \"fragmented industry\" one plant at a time. "}
