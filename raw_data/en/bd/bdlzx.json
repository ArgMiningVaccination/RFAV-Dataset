Amygdalin is found in the pits of many fruits, raw nuts, and plants (see [Question 1](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/laetrile-pdq#_20)). - Laetrile is given by mouth as a pill or by [intravenous (IV) injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44050&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(see [Question 2](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/laetrile-pdq#_22)). - studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44195&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(see [Question 4](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/laetrile-pdq#_24)). - Laetrile is not approved [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(FDA) (see [Question 6](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/laetrile-pdq#_28)). Questions and Answers About Laetrile/Amygdalin - What is laetrile (amygdalin)? [Laetrile](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444998&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)is a [compound](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=422394&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)that has been used as a treatment for people with [cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45333&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Laetrile is another name for [amygdalin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454511&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Amygdalin is a bitter substance found in fruit pits, such as apricots, raw nuts, lima beans, clover, and sorghum. It makes [hydrogen cyanide](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=686192&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)which is changed into cyanide when taken into the body. Hydrogen cyanide is thought to kill cancer [cells](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46476&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Laetrile is also called Vitamin B-17, although it has not been approved as a [vitamin](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44744&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)by the American Institute of Nutrition Vitamins. - How is laetrile given? Laetrile is given by mouth ( [orally](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44068&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)) as a pill. It can also be given by [injection](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44678&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)into a [vein](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=476471&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(IV) or muscle (intramuscular). Laetrile is commonly given by IV at first, then orally as [maintenance therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45768&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(treatment given to help extend the benefit of previous [therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44737&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). Laetrile treatments are given in Mexico and some U.S. clinics. Sometimes laetrile is given in combination with a [metabolic therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44057&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)program (special [diet](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44660&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), high- [dose](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44664&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)vitamins, and [pancreatic](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44074&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov) [enzymes](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46081&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)). - Have any laboratory or animal studies been done using laetrile? In [laboratory studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44512&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [tumor](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46634&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In [animal studies](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454774&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), tests are done to see if a [drug](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=348921&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of laetrile in laboratory experiments. For information on laboratory and animal studies done using laetrile, see the [Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies](/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/laetrile-pdq#_17)section of the health professional version of Laetrile/Amygdalin. - Have any studies of laetrile been done in people? No [controlled [case reports](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44007&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)have not shown laetrile to be an effective treatment for cancer. [Benzaldehyde](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44000&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), which is made when laetrile is broken down by the body, has been tested for anticancer activity in people. In two [clinical series](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44010&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), patients with cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=478743&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)who had not [responded](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44085&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)to with benzaldehyde. Some patients had a [complete response](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45652&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), while some had a decrease in tumor size. The response to benzaldehyde only lasted during treatment. Most of the patients had been treated with [chemotherapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45214&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)or [radiation therapy](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). The [National Cancer Institute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)requested [case reports](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44007&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)from their patients were helped by treatment with laetrile. An expert panel concluded that 2 of 67 patients had [complete responses](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45652&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)and 4 had a decrease in tumor size. Findings from 2 clinical trials conducted by the [National Cancer Institute](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44266&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)reported the following: - A [phase I study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45830&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)tested doses, [schedules](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=346524&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), and ways to give amygdalin in 6 cancer patients. Researchers found that amygdalin caused very few [side effects](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46580&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)at the prescribed doses when given by mouth or by IV. Two patients who ate raw almonds while taking amygdalin had side effects. - A [phase II study](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45831&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)with 175 patients looked at what types of cancer might benefit from treatment with amygdalin. Most of the patients in this study had [breast](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=444971&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), [colon](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44237&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), or [lung cancer](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=445043&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). In about half of the patients, cancer had grown by the end of the treatment. Cancer had grown in all patients 7 months after treatment ended. Patients reported improved [symptoms](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=45022&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov), such as the ability to work or do other activities. These improvements did not last after treatment ended. - A - Have any side effects or risks been reported from laetrile? The side effects of laetrile treatment include the following: The side effects of laetrile depend on the way it is given. Side effects are worse when laetrile is given by mouth. While taking laetrile, side effects get worse when: - Eating raw almonds or crushed fruit pits. - Eating certain types of fruits and vegetables, such as celery, peaches, bean sprouts, and carrots. - Taking high doses of [vitamin C](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=439435&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). - Is laetrile approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454786&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov)(FDA) has not approved laetrile as a treatment for cancer or any other medical [condition](/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=651193&version=patient&language=English&dictionary=Cancer.gov). Laetrile is made in Mexico. The way that laetrile is made is not regulated by the FDA, so batches of laetrile may vary in purity and contents. About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of laetrile/amygdalin in the treatment of people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials).

General CAM Information Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\u2014also called integrative medicine\u2014includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Evaluation of CAM Therapies It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment\u2014not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. [The NCI Best Case Series Program](https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm) which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: - What side effects can be expected? - What are the risks related to this therapy? - What benefits can be expected from this therapy? - Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? - Will the therapy affect conventional treatment? - Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? - If so, who is the sponsor of the trial? - Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
