Holistic detox is beneficial in all processes of recovery and healing. We are exposed to an enormous quantity of toxins from our environment. Our air, our water, our food, fuels, solvents, drugs, heavy metals, hygiene products, dry cleaning, plastics, building materials for our homes and furniture, and almost everything in our life is contaminated with a chemical poison with which our body must contend. 15 Years Experience by Professionals Who Understand Your Journey. We can differentiate between what is casually referred to as \"detoxing\" (a short stay in a clinic to abstain and dry out after drug or alcohol intemperance) and holistic detox \u2014 a more comprehensive umbrella term with more far-reaching health goals. Holistic detox at Alternative to Meds Center aims to gently purge accumulations of toxins from the body and replace vital nutrients and micronutrients that have been stripped away, to restore balance to the body and mind and begin the path to recovery. Lab-testing provides a window of clarity that informs the treatments that can be used in holistic drug detox, including sauna, colon hydrotherapy, nebulized glutathione treatments, environmental medicine, orthomolecular medicine, IV treatments, and many others. This full spectrum that combines holistic detoxification and alternative medicine can be expected to take 60 days or more to complete. Learn more about the dangers of toxin exposure, prescription drugs, and addictive substances below, then discover how holistic drug detox can help you begin healing and recovery. The Problem With Prescription Drugs Illicit drug and alcohol use continues to pose a serious toxicity issue for many Americans \u2014 over 14.8 million people1 admitted to experiencing alcohol use disorder and 39 million people admitted to using illicit drugs within the past year. However, when it comes to the number of people who admit to abusing or misusing prescription drugs within the past year, the figure skyrockets to 58.8 million people. Physicians, psychiatrists, and other health care practitioners prescribe medications in an effort to help us improve some aspect of our physical or mental health \u2014 as a result, most people believe they are inherently safe, effective ways to restore health. However, prescription drugs \u2014 like illicit drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and other common toxins \u2014 can accumulate in the adipose (fatty) tissues of the body over time, causing harmful side effects, additional health issues, and even advanced drug toxicity. Food sources of toxic elements are also a primary route of human exposure.2 Worse, many prescription drugs are highly addictive. While many people begin taking prescription drugs to improve their health or quality of life in some way, the belief that prescriptions are safe, coupled with the positive effects of the drug itself, can lead to accidental dependence over time. Other prescription drugs have well-known euphoric side effects and can produce a \"high\" that many people seek for illicit, recreational benefits. In either case, simply because doctors prescribe a medication does not make it safe \u2014 in fact, in the CDC's recent study3 of overdose death data through 2016, seven of the top 10 causes of overdose deaths were prescription drugs (fentanyl, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, alprazolam, and diazepam). What Happens When the Body Is Exposed to Toxins? Toxin exposure commonly causes multiple short-term and long-term effects.4 The harmful effects of toxic exposure are not limited to alcohol use, prescription or other drug use. Exposure to mercury, cadmium, lead, chemicals in cleaning products, and even processed food can cause multiple short-term and long-term effects. Effects tend to increase over time, as many toxins are fat-soluble, meaning they build up and stabilize in fat cells and increase the body's chemical burden over a lifetime. Unfortunately, just as it is difficult for people to rid their bodies of excess fatty tissue, it is challenging for the body's natural filtration system \u2014 the liver and kidneys \u2014 to remove toxic chemicals. Safe chelation and biotransformative administrations combined with sauna and exercise can assist because these methods of elimination bypass the liver & kidneys, reducing the burden on these vital organs. Exposure to toxins, including alcohol and prescription drugs, can interfere with the body's natural processes.12-22 Toxic effects and damage can include the following: Cancer Certain toxins, like those added to commercial cigarettes, pesticides and many other environmental toxins, and anabolic steroids, can cause cell death and cell regeneration issues that can lead to cancer. Cardiovascular Effects Many toxins, including prescription stimulants, methamphetamines, and more, can cause cardiovascular irregularities that increase the chances of vascular disease, heart attack, and stroke. Respiratory Issues Inhaled toxins and prescription opioids can lead to shallow breathing, slowed breathing, reduced oxygen, and lung damage. Bone and Muscle Effects When toxins replace the natural chemicals necessary to support proper bone and muscle growth, muscular and skeletal fragility and weakness can occur. Gastrointestinal Problems Exposure to many toxins, including prescription opioids, can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, gastric reflux, and constipation. Kidney and Liver Damage Over time, the use of alcohol, illicit drugs, and prescription drugs \u2014 especially when taken together \u2014 can cause toxicity, increases in body temperature, muscular breakdown, and dehydration that can overwork or damage the liver and kidneys. Hormonal Issues Many prescription and illicit drugs access the same pain and pleasure receptors as essential hormones in the body. In turn, hormone imbalances may increase the chances of continued addiction and relapse.5 Neurological Effects The same interaction with the brain's pain and pleasure receptors can cause toxic effects on individual neurons, reducing their ability to function normally. Addiction can inhibit cognition, memory, stress response, impulse control, and more. Worse, toxins in prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and alcohol can cause damage that leads to stroke, seizure, and early cell death. What Is Medication Detoxification? In a traditional sense, this typically means abrupt or rapid discontinuation of alcohol or medications such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, heroin, prescription barbiturates, and prescription opioids that require a hospital level of support. Abrupt discontinuation of medication can result in a shock to the neuroreceptors that have come to depend on a substance to function and can lead to seizure, stroke, or death.22 For certain medications, especially benzos, we find these rapid detox methods to be at times damaging to the patient. Our methods involve a slow and gradual reduction that does not involve acute withdrawal. Safe cessation gently and gradually eliminates the use of prescription drugs, whether prescribed or not, to avoid or mitigate the health issues listed above. As mentioned, methods of holistic detoxing from prescription drugs aid the body to rid itself of harmful toxins. Holistic prescription medication detoxification follows a gradual tapering process to safely reduce or eliminate prescription drug use along with gentle, deep cleansing to eliminate toxic residues. Nutritional and alternative therapies are provided to address symptoms so the drugs are no longer required for improved natural mental health. We recommend safe, holistic detoxing from prescription drugs in a professional setting, under the observation of trained medical professionals. Certified staff can help you eliminate toxins from your body in a controlled manner that minimizes withdrawal symptoms, which reduces the likelihood of relapse. Careful monitoring of the vital signs, as well as closely monitoring overall physical and mental health, ensures that no aspect of your health is at risk. What Is Holistic Drug Detox? The process of holistic detoxification is the first step toward eliminating your dependence on prescription medications and other addictive substances. However, it is important to remember that this addiction is both physical and psychological in nature, and we believe an effective holistic detox process should provide a balance between the two. As a result, holistic drug detox focuses on the whole person \u2014 the physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual components that make you, you. As a part of a larger, more comprehensive, addiction treatment program, much of our holistic detox is rooted in science-backed, evidence-based services while also providing a more integrated approach to whole-body health that only alternative medicine can offer. For example, many holistic detox programs include the use of traditional practices like acupuncture, massage, and meditation. At times, acute detoxing from illicit and prescription drugs or alcohol may require a temporary visit to an acute care facility for the administration of select, essential medications for safety and standard medical protocols. If needed, we provide referrals to these acute care facilities. However, the ultimate goal of holistic drug detox is to halt or at least significantly reduce all prescription medications and achieve improved natural mental health.
