During the first 12 hours of a detox your body stops the process of metabolising i.e. converting food into energy. The energy that the body would use to process food then gets redirected into self-healing. The physiological benefits will include disease prevention, reduced symptoms from many different ailments, cleanse the body, give digestive organs a rest, overall rejuvenation, weight loss, clearer skin, slower aging, increased flexibility, improved fertility and enhanced senses. The more subtle benefits of a detox can include getting in touch with a deeper sense of yourself, by freeing yourself from toxins and allowing the body to utilise the energy from digestion you become more receptive to subtle changes. These can include having a clearer mind, heightened intuition, opening up emotionally and allowing for more positive possibilities to enter our lives. Jesus Christ, Paramahansa Yogananda, Mahatma Ghandi, Dr. Martin Luther King and many other spiritual teachers have advocated fasting for spiritual and physical health.

[SEND US AN ENQUIRY](/contact/) PRE AND POST DETOX RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A HEALTHIER BODY To optimize your detox experience with us and maximize its benefits, it is recommended to allow at least 2 days of a \"pre-cleanse\". This is a diet that is predominantly vegetarian with alkalizing foods. The importance of pre-cleansing is to clear the body of toxins as much as possible to prepare yourself for the full detox process. Not only will this maximize the benefits but will also decrease any herxheimer symptoms (detox symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness). Following on from the detox, post cleansing is just as important. Slowly reintroducing foods into the diet not only allows the body to reintegrate into digestion but it also looks after the new microbiome that is developing in your gut. To continue to cultivate good health and take better care of your newly cleansed and sensitive system we recommend you follow our post detox recommendations. All of our detox programs that are 11 nights and up include a sufficient amount of pre and post cleanse days. You are welcome at add or subtract any number of pre/post cleanse days to best suit your needs.
