The cellular etiology of this heterogeneity is poorly 37 understood. Here, we generated and analyzed a single -cell transcriptome atlas of 49,859 CRC 38 cells from 16 patients , validated with an additional 31,383 cells from an independent CRC patient 39 cohort . We describe subclonal transcriptomic heterogeneity of CRC tumor epithelial , as as discrete stromal popul ations of cancer -associated fibroblasts (CAF s). Within CRC CAFs, we 41 identify the transcriptional signature of specific subtype s that significantly stratifies overall survival 42 in more than 1,500 CRC patients with bulk transcriptomic data . We demonstrate that scRNA 43 analysis of malignant, stromal , and immune cells exhibit a more complex picture than portrayed 44 by bulk transcriptomic -based Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) classification. By 45 demonstrating an abundant degree of heterogene ity amongst these cell types, our work shows 46 that CRC is best represented in a transcriptomic continuum crossing traditional classification 47 systems boundaries . Overall, this CRC cell map provides a framework to re-evaluate CRC tumor 48 biology with implications for clinical trial design and therapeutic development . 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 .

Approximately 50% of patients experience disease relapse 70 following curative -intent surgical resection and chemotherapy3,4. Despite the high incidence and 71 mortality of advanced CRC, few effective therapies have been approved in the past several 72 decades5. One barrier to the development of efficacious therapeutic s is the biological 73 heterogeneity of CRC and its variable clinical course6. While landmark studies from The Cancer 74 Genome Atlas (TCGA) have defined the somatic mutational landscape within CRC, several 75 studies have shown that stromal signatures, including fibroblasts and cytotoxic T cells, are likely 76 the main drivers of clinical outcomes7-12. These findings suggest that the clinical phenotypes of 77 CRC and by extension, its tumor biology , is shaped by a complex niche of heterotypic cel l 78 interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME)8-12. 79 80 Bulk gene expression analys es by several independent groups have identified distinct CRC 81 subtypes13-15. Reflect ing both the tumor and TME, an international consortium published the 82 Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS), which proposed four distinct subtypes of CRC13,14,16. 83 Unfortunately, the association between CMS and meaningful therapeutic response to specific 84 agents have shown inconsistent results across studies and CMS lacks a concordance between 85 primary and metastatic CRC tumors, limiting its utility thus for in clinical decision making17-24. As 86 a result, an improved CMS classification or an alternative classification system is required to 87 improve clinical utility . 88 89 To overcome the limitations of bulk -RNA sequenc e profiling, we utilized single -cell RNA 90 sequencing (scRNA -seq) to more thoroughly evaluate the CRC subtypes at the molecular level , 91 including within the context of the currently defined CMS classification .

Altogether, we captured and retained 49,589 single cell s 99 after performing quality control for downstream analysis (Fig. 1 a, supplementary table 1 ).

Additionally, 103 each cell type compartment was analyzed separately . Cluster v0.4.1 and manual review of 104 differentially expressed genes in each subcluster were studied to choose the best cluster 105 resolution without cluster destabilization (see methods)25.

Clusters were chiefly influenced by colonic epithelial markers, including those for CHGA ) 132 (Supplementary Fig. 2 a and Supplementary Table 2). Some tumor -derived clusters (C7, C8, 133 and C13) did not express known colon epithelial markers, potentially representing a de - 134 differentiated state of plasticity ( Supplementary Fig. 2b )31. Each distinct tumor -derived cluster 135 was predominantly patient -specific, reflecting a high degree of inter -patient tumoral cell 136 heterogeneity. In contrast, epithelial populations derived from non -malignant tissue samples from 137 multiple patients clustered together, a pattern observed in previous studies confirming both 138 normal tissue homeostasis and limited sample batch effects (Fig. 2a)32,33. 139 140 We next aimed to identify gene expression programs shared across these clusters using hallmark 141 pathway analysis34. A strong overlap was observed for multiple pathways such as activation of 142 inflammatory, epithelial -mesenchymal transformation (EMT), immune response, and metabolic 143 pathways ( Fig. 2 b).

Each cluster also showed activation of 146 unique pathways such as activation of angiogenesis (C6), . However, MSI -H tumors 148 differed from MSS tumors based on immune cell infiltration (Extended Data Fig. 1). 149 150 Since intratumoral heterogeneity is recognized as a key mechanism contributing to drug 151 resistance, cancer progression, and recurrence, we next focused on dissecting potential 152 transcriptomic states to identify heterogeneity within each patient's tumor35-38. We found that each 153 tumor specimen contained 2-10 distinct tumor epithelial clusters (Fig. 2c). Gene set variation 154 analysis (GSVA) was performed on cells from individual tumor samples and illustrated the sub- 155 clonal transcriptomic heterogeneity within each specimen (Supplementary Fig. 2c)39. Clusters 156 identified in individual pathway analysis demonstrated the up- or down-regulation of crucial 157 metabolic and oncogenic pathways between samples, suggesting wide phenotype variations 158 between cells from the same tumor40. 159 160 Given the evidence of intratumoral epithelial heterogeneity, we next performed trajectory 161 inference using pseudotime analysis to identify potential alignments or lineage relationships (i.e., 162 right versus left-sided CRC), CMS classification, or MSI status 163 (Fig. 2d)41,42. This analysis also served as a control for inter-patient genomic heterogeneity and 164 provided an orthogonal strategy to confirm the transcriptomic trends we identified. We detected 165 five molecular states (S1n/t to S5n/t) with malignant and normal epithelial cells intermixed along 166 a joint transcriptional trajectory. This observation is consistent with prior studies demonstrating 167 that CRC cells recapitulate normal colon epithelia's multilineage differentiation process as each 168 transcriptional state's pathway activation in both normal and tumor cells was related to normal 169 .

Interestingly, there were no significant associations with anatomic 175 location, CMS classification, or MSI status within our dataset or an independent dataset of 31,383 176 single cells ( Supplementary Fig. 4)30. Hence, in our analysis, CRC development mainly 177 represents a hijacking of the normal epithelial differentiation program, coupled with the acquisition 178 of additional cancer -related and embryogenic pathways ( Supplementary Fig. the tumor microenvironment exhibit diverse phenotypes , 181 and specific subtypes are associated with poor prognosis. 182 183 We next focused on CRC TME subpopulations.

This fibroblast cluster dichotomy was also observed in the 188 independent CRC patient sc RNA -seq dataset of 31,383 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5)30. 189 190 The CAF-S1 and CAF -S4 subtypes showed striking resemblances to (extracellular 191 matrix) and vCAF (vascular) fibroblast subtypes, respectively, as previously de scribed in a mouse 192 breast cancer mode l48. Most clusters were found in multiple patients, albeit in varying proportions, 193 signifying shared patterns in CAF transcriptomic programs between patients.

Additionally, 198 CAF-S1 expressed extracellular matrix genes including matrix -modifying enzymes ( LOXL 1 and 199 LOX)48. To determine this popul ation's functional significance, we compared the CAF -S1 200 population transcriptomes to those described recently in breast cancer, lung cancer, and head 201 and neck cancer49. We recovered five CAF subtypes, within the CAF -S1 population, including 202 ecm-myCAF (extracellular; GJB+ ), IL-iCAF ), which were previously divided into two major subtypes : iCAF and myCAF (Fig. 206 3b). Among these five subtypes, ecm-myCAF and TGF-myCAF are known to correlate with 207 immunosuppressive environments and are enriched in tumors with high regulatory T lymphocytes 208 (Tregs) and depleted CD8+ lymphocytes. Additionally, these subtypes are associate d with 209 primary immunotherapy resistance in melanoma and lung cancer49. 210 211 The CAF -S4 particular CAF subtype is vessel -associated, with 213 hypoxia potentially contributing to invasion and metastasis , as has been shown in another stud y 214 48.

We detected a strong and 222 positive correlat ion between specific gene expressions characterizing each CAF subtype in CRC, 223 pancreatic cancer, and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Fig. 4) (see methods for datasets ). 224 The gene signatures were specific to each CAF -S1 and CAF -S4, thus confirming their existence 225 in colorectal cancers and other tumor types. 226 227 We found high CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 signatures associated with poor median overall -survival and 228 early ca ncer recurrence (HR>1, p<0.05), irrespective of CMS subtypes in three independent CRC 229 datasets (Supplementary Fig 7). Additionally, CAF signatures stratified the CMS4 subtype into 230 high- and low -risk overall survival in all datasets , thus identifying additional heterogeneity and 231 providing prognos tication in this aggressive patient subgroup (Fig. 4b-d). Here, using scRNA - 232 seq, we show for the first time that high CAF infiltration in CRC is associated with poor prognosis 233 across all mole cular subtypes , and which further stratifies the CMS4 subgroup into high and low - 234 risk clinical phenotypes in CRC cohorts. 235 236 Single -cell RNA sequencing reveals heterogeneity beyond Consensus Molecular Subtypes 237 in colorectal cancers and offers therapeutic opp ortunities. 238 239 The lack of association between tumor epithelia and CMS classification, as well as the survival 240 differences between high - and low -risk CAF signatures across CRC molecular subtypes suggest 241 CRCs are much more heterogeneous than the traditional classification systems have indicated 242 (e.g. those systems defined by somatic alterations, epigenomic features , and bulk gene 243 expression data )13,14,51,52. 244 245 Among these the widely adopted CMS classification, which reflects both the malignant cell 246 phenotypes and the TME, classified CRC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

To 248 test our hypothesis, we estimated every cell type fraction using single -cell data from eight pooled 249 datasets (>1,500 samples ) with a machine -learning algorithm, CIBERSORTx53. When w e 250 compared epithelial, immune , and stromal cell populations among the CMS subtypes , we did not 251 detect a distinct pattern of tumor , immune, or stromal cell signatures across the different CMS 252 subtypes . Each CMS subtype was en riched in these cell types in varying proportions but without 253 a clear distinction s between the four subtype s, suggesting a lack of clear separation among the 254 CMS subsets at the single -cell resolution (Fig. 5a-b). Upon analysis of four independent bulk RNA 255 datasets, there was significant discordance in terms of cell phenotype enrichment with respect 256 to each CMS subtype across the datasets except CMS4 which had predominant stromal 257 enrichment (Supplementary Fig s. 8-11)54. These discordant results could be due to intra -patient 258 CMS heterogeneity, intratumoral variation in tumor purity, stromal and immune cell infiltration, 259 and CMS's inability to address tumor/TME-to-tumor/TME variability, among others16. Thus, novel 260 approaches that consider these factors are required to stratify patients for optimal biomarker and 261 therapeutic development. 262 263 Based on the above findings, we postulate that CRC is more accurately represented in a 264 transcriptomic continuum previously proposed by Ma et al .55. The authors analyzed bulk 265 transcriptomic data using a novel computational framework in which denovo, 266 clustering methods (k-medoid, non-negative-matrix factorization, and consensus demonstrated the existence of CRC in a transcriptomic continuum56-58. They further carried out 268 principal component analysis and robustly validated two principal components, PC Cluster 269 Subtype Scores 1 and 2 (PCSS1 and PCSS2 , respectively) . We reasoned t hat using single -cell 270 data could deepen our understanding of how each cell phenotype contributes to the CRC tumor 271 microenvironment using continuous scores that inform CRC diversity beyond binning CRC into 272 traditional classifications . 273 .

On projecting single - 277 cell expression profiles on quadrants corresponding to each of the four CMS , we noted a lack of 278 separation of all cell phenotypes between CMS subtypes suggesting that CRC exists in a 279 transcriptomic continuum55. 280 281 To test continuous scores reproducibility, we analyzed four bulk transcriptomic datasets 282 separately; we found that transcriptional shifts were reproducible across datasets for all major cell 283 types (Supplementary Fig s. 8-11). The contin uous score s showed no relia classifying CRC into immune -stromal desert (CMS2/CMS3 ) subtypes 285 as proposed previously 21. Thus, confirming continuous scores rather than dis crete subtypes may 286 improve classifying CRC tumors and may explain variability, tumor/TME-to- 287 tumor /TME and TME -to-TME Of note, CAF -S1 exhibited high PCSS1 and PCSS2 288 score s across independent datasets , correlat ing with t he CMS4 subtype. Thus, our analysis 289 identified CAF -S1 as a cell of origin for biological heterogeneity in CMS4 subtypes associated 290 with poor prognosis (Supplem entary table 5 ). 291 292 DISCUSSION 293 In the present study, we evaluated the CMS classification of CRC that have been developed by 294 bulk RNA-seq through single-cell resolution transcriptomic analysis. We find that stromal cells 295 engender a more significant contribution to biological heterogeneity . Although previous studies 296 employing bulk transcriptomics have demonstrated th at the degree of stromal infiltration is 297 associated with prognosis and a small scRNAseq study utilizing 26 fibroblasts demonstrated poor 298 survival among CAF-enriched CRC tumors especially the CMS4 subtype . Here, using much larger 299 .

Further , we 301 develop ed a novel signature of CAF infiltration and demonstrate that CMS4 can be stratifi ed into 302 risk groups associated with good or poor median overall survival . These findings are significant 303 since the CMS4 subtype, is primarily stromal-driven and is enriched in more than 40% of 304 metastatic CRC samples from patients with worse outcomes22. We also identified CAF-S1 305 subtypes associated with certain biological functions in other cancers , including the ecm-myCAF 306 and TGF -myCAF NSCLC and 307 melanoma), and CAF-S4s known to play a role in inducing cancer cell invasion49,50. Thus, 308 targeting CAFs to remodel the tumor microenvironment may lead to improved and much-needed 309 therapeutic development for metastatic CRC patients22,23. 310 311 Targeting of CAFs in solid tumors is being explored in multiple clinical trials with variable results60-312 62. Such studies likely failed to address CAF heterogeneity and their complex interactions with the 313 other cells of TME. Our study suggests that CRC may be intricately entwined with the stroma , 314 and therefore may be amenable to stromal targete d combinat oric approaches, including 315 monoclonal antibodies that abrogat e CAF-S1 function . In future studies, t he treatment of CRC 316 patients should involv e stroma targeted therapies and take the above aspects into 317 consideration60,63. The scRNA -seq or bulk -RNA -seq signature s corresponding to CAF -S1 and 318 CAF-S4 may serve as suitable biomarker s for tumors that are reliant on this axis. Immunoth erapy 319 responses in MSS CRC of lacking; CAF 320 subpopulations within the TME may be suppressing immune responses in these tumors 64. Based 321 on our analysis, w e speculate that targeting CAF -derived chemokines and cytokines via 322 biospecific antibodies, vaccines , or even cell -based therapies, may enhance current checkpoint 323 blockade strategies60. Functional validation and clinical studies will be required to confirm the 324 clinical utility of targeting these CAF populations in CRC. 325 .

Based on our findings, it appears that bulk analysis may have been confounded by 329 varying tumor microenvironment population enrichment , and that tumor cells within each patient 330 do no t segregate into static phenotypes but rather exhibit considerable plasticity. In contrast , the 331 single -cell analysis uncovered the complex and mixed cellular -phenotypes among each cell 332 specific subpopulation , which projected in a transcriptomic continuum a cross CMS subtypes . 333 These findings were further supported by scRNA -seq CMS classification analysis that assigned 334 each CRC sample to multiple CMS subtypes thereby suggesting CMS heterogeneity in each CRC 335 tumor21,65. These findings may also explain why CMS -defined populations of tumors have not 336 been readily observed in transcriptomic data from independent CRC cohorts22,54. Our data 337 indicate that attempts to divide CRC phenotypes into the current discrete subtypes may 338 undermine optimal patient stratification in the clinical trial setting . Intriguingly, by applying two 339 independent algorithms , we demonstrate that CRC tumors and their ecosystem s exist in a 340 transcriptomic continuum and not only show tumor -to-tumor variability (as proposed by Ma et al.) 341 but also demonstrate tumor/TME -to-tumor /TME transcriptional variabilit y at the single The continuous scores are reproducible across transcriptomic datasets, thus 343 allowing robust identification of patient subtypes . This may help to optimiz e CRC treatment in 344 future studies. 345 346 In conclusion, our study lends strong support to the tumor biology models proposed by Ma et al. 347 (and other groups) and represent s a conceptual shift in our understanding of CRC pathogenesis, 348 clinical management, and therapeutic development. Future studies will need to consider tumor - 349 TME to tumor -TME heterogeneity which will be critical for optimizing biomarkers and treatment 350 strategies for CRC. 351 .

CRC specimens from 16 patients including 389 nine Caucasian, six African American and one Asian patient with corresponding 8 adjacent normal 390 tissue samples were processed immediately after collection at Rush Univers ity Medical Center 391 Biorepository and sent for scRNA -seq. Thus our scRNA -seq atlas repre sent diverse patient 392 population . The study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards and all patients 393 provided written informed consent. 394 395 Droplet based scRNA -seq - 10\u00d7 library using 10X Genomics Single Cell 5' Platform. Tumors 397 samples were enzymatically dissociated ( ll strainer, pelleted after g and resuspended in DAPI -FACS buffer 399 (PBS, 0.04 % BSA). Samples were sorted and viable singlets were gated on the basis of scatter 400 properties and DAPI exclusion. Approximately 3000 cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS , 401 and cells underwent single cell droplet -based capture on 10X Chromium instruments according 402 to the 10X Genomics Single Cell 5' Platform protocol. libraries post-fragmentation, and A -tailing double -sided size se lection , and subsequent adaptor ligation also 404 followed the manufacturer's protocol. Illumina NextSeq 550 was used for library sequencing and 405 data were mapped and counted using Cellranger -v3.1.0 ( GRCh38/hg38 ). gene -expression quantification, dimensionality reduction , 408 and identification of cell clusters . Cell Ranger was utilized to process the raw gene expression 409 matrices per samples and all samples from multiple patients were combined in R package (v3.6.3 410 .

Genes detected in fewer than three cells and cells expressing less than 412 200 detected genes were filtered out and excluded f rom analysis . In addition, cells expressing > 413 25% mitochondria were removed. Cell cycle scoring was performed, (for the S phase and the 414 G2M phase ) and the predicted cell cycle phase s were calculated. Doublet detection and any 415 higher -order multiplets that were not disso ciated during sample preparation were removed via 416 the DoubletFinder (v2.0.2) package using default settings67. Following quality control one n on- 417 malignant colon sample (B -cac13) was discarded due to poor data quality. Finally, 49 ,859 cells 418 remained and were utilized for downstrea m analysis. 419 We adopted the general protocol described in Stuart et al. (2019) to group single cells into differen t 420 cell subsets66. We employed the following steps : clustering the cells within each compartment 421 (including the selecti on of variable genes for each dataset based on a variance stabilizing 422 transformation [VST]), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to remove batch eff ects among the 423 samples, reduction of dimensionality, and projection of cells onto graphs 68,69. Principal 424 component analysis (PCA) was carried out on the scaled data of highly variable genes70. The first 425 30 principal compon ents (PCs) were used to cluster the cells and to perform a subtype analysis 426 by nonlinear dimensionality reduction (t -SNE) and to construct Uniform Manifold Approximation 427 and Pr ojection (UMAP) for cell embeddings71,72. We identified cell clusters under the optimal 428 resolution by a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity optimization -based clustering method. 429 We implemented the FindClusters functio n of the Seurat package, which firs t calculated k-nearest 430 neighbors and constructed the SNN graph. We implemented the original Louvain algorithm 431 (algorithm = 1) for modularity optimization. Additionally, we utilized Clustree (v0.4.3) and manual 432 review for identifying the best clustering resolution25. 433 434 Major cell type detection and data visualization . To identify all major cell types, we evaluated 435 differentially expressed markers in each identity cell group by comparing them to other clusters 436 .

We used positively expressed genes with an average 437 expression of >/= 2 -fold higher in that subcluster than th e average expression in the rest of the 438 other subclusters. We used known marker genes, which have the highest fold expression in that 439 cluster with respect to the other clusters. We also utilized SingleR ((v0.99.10, R Package) , which 440 leverage large transcriptomic datasets of well -annotated cell types and manual annotation for 441 cell-type identification32,73 -75. Depending on the presence of kno wn marker genes the clusters 442 were cells 445 (MZB1 ), 32,48,73,76 -80. The cells were eventually assembled into DGE matrices within each 446 compartment, containing all six cell types. 447 448 Major -cell type subclustering and data visualization . Each major cell type , including epithelial 449 cells, endothelial cells, T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, and fibroblasts was reclustered and 450 reanalyzed to study each compartment at a higher resolution to detect granular cellular 451 heterogeneity in CRC . Clustree (v0.4.3) and manual review were utilized for optimal cluster 452 detection. For cel l annotation of each cell type , we utilized published literatur e gene expression 453 signatures and manual review of differential genes among clusters. Additionally, we again utilized 454 SingleR (v0.99.10, R Package) for unbiased cell annotation. Interestingly , reclustering of major 455 compartments individually also detected clusters expressing hybrid markers as well as cell 456 clusters expressing markers from distinct lineage s (such as T cell clusters expressing B cells); 457 these were removed and excluded for further a nalysis. We u tilized UMAP for visualization 458 purposes. For validation, we analyzed 65,362 cells from 23 patients and applied the same quality 459 control me trics as outlined above , retain ing 31,383 high-quality single cells for further analysis30. 460 These high -quality cells were analyzed utilizing the same pipelines and parameters as that for our 461 primary cohort (Supplementar y Figs. 4 -5 and 12-13). 462 .

Non -malignant epithelial cells were used as the control group. 465 466 Trajectory analysis . We use d Monocle v.2 (v2.14.0), a reverse graph embedding method to 467 reconstruct single -cell trajectories in tumor and non -malignant epithelium82. In brief, we used UMI 468 count matrices and the negbinomial.size() parameter to create a CellDataSet object in the d efault 469 setting. We grouped projected cells on UMAP in default settings for visuali zation of monocle 470 results. We defined the cumulative duration of the trajectory to show the average amount of 471 transcriptional transition that a cell undergoes as it passes fr om the starting state to the end state. 472 The cells were also ordered in pseudotime to explain the transition of cells from one state to 473 another. 474 475 Pathway - Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) . Pathway analysis was performed on the 50 476 hallmark gene sets downloaded from Molecular Signatures Database (v7.2). We used GSVA 477 (v1.34.0), a non -parametric, unsupervised method to estimate the gene set variation s and 478 evaluation of pathway enrichment , and p athway scores were calculated for each cell using 479 standard settings 34,39. 480 481 DNA and bulk RNA library construction . DNA and bulk RNA sequencing was performed as 482 previously described83. One hundred nanograms of DNA from each tumor was mechanically 483 sheared to an average size of 200 bp. Using the KAPA Hyper Prep Pack , DNA libraries were 484 packed, hybridized into the xT probe package, and amplified with the KAPA HiFi HotStart 485 ReadyMix . For uniformity , each sample need ed to have 95% of all targeted base pairs sequenced 486 to a minimum depth of 300x. One hundred nanograms of RNA per tumor sample was hea t 487 fragmented to a mean size of 200 base pairs in the presence of magnesium. Using random 488 .

After library 490 planning, the IDT xGEN Exome Test Panel was hybridized with samples. Streptavidin -coated 491 beads and target recovery were carried out, accompanied by amplification using the KAPA HiFi 492 library amplification package. librar ies were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 using 493 patterned flow cell technology to achieve at least 50 million reads. 494 495 Detection of somatic varia tion on DNA sequencing data . The tumor and normal FASTQ files 496 were paired. For quality management measurement , FASTQ files we re evaluated using FASTQC 497 and matched with Novoalign (Novocraft, Inc.)83,84. SAM files were generated and converted to 498 BAM files. The BAM files were sorted, and duplicates were marked. Single nucleotide variations 499 (SNVs) were called after alignment and sorting. For discovery of copy number alterations, the de - 500 duplicated BAM files and the VCF generated from the variant calling pipeline were processed to 501 computat e read depth and variance of heterozygous germline SNVs between the tumor sample 502 and normal sample. Binary circular segme ntation was introduced and segments with strongly 503 differential log 2 ratios between the tumor and its comparator were chosen. From a combination of 504 differential coverage in segmented regions and estimation of stromal admixture provided by 505 analysis of hetero zygous germline SNVs, an estimated integer copy number was determined 506 507 Microsatellite instability status . Probes for 43 microsatellite regions were developed using 508 Tempus xT assay83. Tumors were categorized into three groups by the MSI classification 509 algorithm as described by Tempus: microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H), microsatellite stable 510 (MSS) o r microsatellite equivocal (MSE). MSI screening for paired tumor -normal patients used 511 reads mapped to the microsatellite loci with at least 5 bps flanking the microsatellite. The sample 512 was graded as MSI -H if there was a >70 % chance of MSI -H classification. If the likelihood of MSI - 513 H status was 30 -70%, the test findings were too ambiguous to interpret and those samples were 514 .

If there was a <30 % chance of MSI -H status, the sample was called MSS. 515 Additionally, IHC results were use d to classify tumors into MSS or MSI molecular subtypes. Both 516 of these modalities were concordant and produced the same results. 517 518 Bulk RNA -seq and microarray analysis . We downloaded and pooled and 521 a non-small cell lung cancer dataset (GSE3353292) to validate our findings from the single cell 522 compartments by deconvoluting the bulk gene expression profile s into pseudo single -cell 523 resolution s. We used Affy (v1.64.0) for the data analysis and for exploration of Affymetrix 524 oligonucleotide array probe level data93. Batch correction was carried out using the 525 removeBatchEffect (v3. 42.2) function of the LIMMA program and CMScaller for the CMS 526 classification (s ee below)94. Three datasets ( GSE1753687, GSE3311389, and GSE3958214) were 527 utilized for clinical outcome analysis94,95. 528 529 Correlation patterns in bulk gene expressions for CAF compartments . To identify the top 530 correlated CAF -marker genes within the combined eight and individual four bulk gene expression 531 sets, we first transformed the bulk gene expression sets with log 2 transformation . Next, m arker 532 genes with an average log 2 FC>/= 0.5 and p<0.05 obtained from the SC analysis of CAF -S1 an d 533 CAF-S4 compartments were separately intersected with the bulk gene expression sets. Genes 534 with an average Spearman correlation score greater than 0.8 were kept as the CAF signatures 535 within the bulk gene expression . Heatmaps illustrating the correlation patterns within and between 536 the CAF compartments were prepared with the heatmap.2 function from ggplot packag e (v3.1.1) 537 utilizing the Pearson correlation coefficient. Heatmaps illustrating the correlation patterns within 538 and between the CAF compartmen ts were prepared using the ggplot package (v3.1.1) the Pearson correlation coefficient96. 540 .

Each cell type's marker genes with an average 543 logFC>1 and adjusted P<0.05 were intersected with the bulk expression datasets separately. We 544 only kept the marker genes with a high correlation with each other in bulk, which provides an 545 average correlation score of > 0.8. The average bulk expression of each cell type's remaining 546 marker genes was calculated and used in the hazard regression model as the representative of 547 this cell type. For analysis of relationships with patient outcome, univariate models were 548 calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression (coxph function from survi val R package )97. 549 550 Deconvoluting public bulk gene expression profiles into pseudo single -cell expressions . 551 We used CIBERSORTx v1 to estimate composition of various cell populations in poole d eight 552 microarray datasets53. Signature gene matrices were created using the expression profiles of 553 49,859 cells as the reference single cell profile. We ran the 'hires' module with default parameters 554 except for the 'rmbatchBmode ,' and the bulk -mode batch correction argument w as set to true. 555 After the deconvolution process, we no rmalized the gene expressions according to the cell 556 fractions in each sample and calculated each gene's Z -transformed expression values. The 557 average normalized expression of each cell type across all sa mples was plotted with the 558 heatmap.3 R function of the GMD package (v0.3.3)98. A signature matrix highlighting marker 559 genes of the different cell types was prepared with a heatmap.2 R function of ggplot (v3.1.1) . We 560 also the GSE1433386, GSE1753687, GSE3311389, molecular subtyping of colorectal cancer (CMS Classification) . We used R 564 package CMScaller (v0.9.2), a nearest template prediction (NTP) algorithm, for the classification 565 of gene expression datasets95.

We ran CMScaller with default 567 paramete rs. 568 569 Continuous subtype discovery using scRNA -seq analysis . Bulk mRNA expression profiles of 570 the combined and batch adjusted eight GEO datasets 1584 572 samples in total, were deconvoluted into the pseudo single -cell expression profiles via 573 CIBERSORT x utilizing the expression data consisting of 2 o different cell types from our scRNA - 574 seq data set53. We transformed the d econvoluted expression matrix with log2 transformation. The 575 principal components cluster subtype scores (PCSSs) of the CMS subtypes among the 1584 576 samples, were determined separately for each cell type using an algorithm published by Ma et 577 al55. To obtain the PCSSs, the average loading vectors were used. The results obtained for 2 0 578 cell types were projected on the first two PCSSs (PCSS1 and P CSS2) as they were validated by 579 Ma et al. in their analysis using 18 datasets. We also analyzed four datasets ( GSE1433386, 580 and GSE3958214) to independently confirm reproducibility of 581 continuous scores. 582 583 Statistics and reproducibility . All statistical analyses and graphs were created in R (v3.6.3) and 584 using a Python -based computational analysis tool. Schematic representations were made using 585 the Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/) software . Dim plots, bar plots and box plots were generated 586 using the dittoSeq (v1.1.7 ) package with default parameters99. Violin plots were generated using 587 the patchwork (v1.1.0) package and ggplot 2 (v3.3.2 ) packag e in R with default parameters . Heatmaps were generated using Morpheus.R with default parameters100,101. ANOVA and pair - 589 wised t -tests for the CMS classes across the deconvoluted expression profiles were performed in 590 R using the ggpubr R (v0.4.0) package102. The Box and Whisker plots were generated using the 591 boxplot function of the R base package at default parameters . The mean of the log 2 transformed 592 .

The l ength of a boxplot corresponds to the interquartile 594 range (IQR), which is defined as th e range between the first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3), 595 whereas the whiskers are the upper and lower extreme values of the data (either data's extre mum 596 values, or the Q3+1.5*IQR and Q1 -1.5*IQR values, whichever was less extreme). 597 598 Survival analysis . Survival curves were obtained according to the Kaplan -Meier method survfit 599 (v3.2 -7), and differences between survival distributions were assessed by Log -rank test. The 600 patients were divided into two groups (high/poor and low /good risk) according to their med ian 601 expression values (survminer (v0.4.8 )). The surv_cutpoint function uses the maximally selected 602 rank statistics and implements standard methods for the approximation of the null distribution of 603 maximally selected rank statistics (maxstat (v0.7 -25). 604 605 The proportional hazard assumption was tested to examine the fit of the model for survival of the 606 samples in four GEO datasets ( GSE1433386, GSE1753687, GSE3311389, the deconvoluted bulk mRNA expressions.

We used known 79 canonical markers and p ublished expression signatures to identify T cell states for further 80 analysis (see methods). We identified conventional CD4+ T cells, CD4+ Tregs, CD8+ 81 (naive/memory, cytotoxic, and NK cells, and innate lymphoid 82 cells (ILC). Am ong the conventional CD4+ T cells, we identified the central memory/naive like - 83 state (CCR7+, SELL+, and TCF7+) enriched in non -malignant samples. In contrast, Th17 cells 84 expressing IL -17, known as critical anti -tumor effectors, were enriched in tumor sampl es. CD4+ 85 Tregs (FOXP3+) expressing immune checkpoint markers and costimulatory molecules were 86 among the most abundant T cells in the colorectal TME compared to non -malignant tissue. 87 Among the CD8+ T cell states, CD8+ cytotoxic cells were distributed across three clusters that 88 we labeled CD8+ effector 1, CD8+ effector 2, clusters 89 expressed cytotoxicity genes and chemokines as previously described in other tumor types. 90 CD8 effector3 was predominantly enriched in MSI -H CRC pa tients and represented 77% of the 91 total CD8+ effector 3 population among the 2 MSI -H CRC samples. This cluster expressed 92 ITGAE, LAYN, CXCL13, and T cell exhaustion markers (LAG3, HAVCR2, and CD96), possibly 93 explaining this CD8+ cell state's role in the res ponse to immune checkpoint inhibitors in MSI -H 94 colorectal tumors. Gene -set enrichment of CD8+ effectors further confirmed their distinct states. 95 CD8+ effector 2 was a proliferative cluster with MYC activity, NOTCH activation, and EF2 96 targets. CD8+ effector (s), CD8+ MAIT cells, and NK cells were enriched in tumors, whereas 97 Tissue -resident memory (Trm) cells were depleted in tumor tissue. Trm induction was recently 98 .

All B 112 cell subtypes from the CRC TME and the non -malignant colonic tissue clustered together 113 exhibiting transcriptional similarity among non -tumor and tumor -derived cells. Memory B cells 114 and plasma cells we re enriched in tumors, while naive and GC B cells were enriched in non - 115 malignant tissue. 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 .
