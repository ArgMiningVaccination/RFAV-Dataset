Once the virus has taken over a host cell, it may continue to spread and assault without being seen. The lack of knowledge on the particular location of this virus was formerly its major obstacle. However, that is no longer the case. According to research, the herpes virus has a \"newly discovered \"kill-switch\" that, when activated, prevents the infection from multiplying. In fact, the immune system can now target the illness and completely eliminate it thanks to this research. This new finding involves three naturally occurring compounds that mimic the effects of tranylcypromine (TCP). Because TCP lacks a license to manage herpes, they have opted to employ exclusively natural therapies. It is possible to rid individuals of the painful blisters and sores that accompany herpes, as well as the stigma associated with the condition and, most crucially, the danger that they pose to others. Fortunately, HerpaGreens has devised a revolutionary method of avoiding this problem by interfering with the viral DNA by inhibiting a protein called LAD-1. This stops the virus from assuming its normal-looking cellular disguise, making it easier for the immune system to eliminate it. The major purpose of HerpaGreens seems to be mitigating the physical symptoms of the Herpes Simplex Virus, but the product also includes a number of components that are likely to assist the efficient functioning of the general physiology of multiple vital systems. HerpaGreens has been shown to be effective against herpes, and its users report better gastrointestinal, mental, and cardiovascular health as a result. One serving of HerpaGreens (one scoop) should be mixed with water or another beverage base once or twice daily. Price: $79 for one bottle 4.

Your doctor may suspect that you have the virus if you have any of the common symptoms, such as sores or blisters. If you have these symptoms, your doctor will likely order a blood test to look for antibodies to the herpes virus. Antibodies are proteins that your body produces in response to an infection. If you have active herpes lesions, your doctor may swab one of the sores and send the sample to a laboratory to be tested for the presence of the virus. This is known as a viral culture. It can take up to two weeks to get results from a viral culture. The most reliable way to diagnose herpes is through a PCR blood test, which can detect the DNA of HSV-1 and HSV-2. PCR tests are generally very accurate, but they are expensive and not commonly used. If you think you may have herpes, discuss your symptoms with your doctor. They will likely order one or more of the tests described above to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for Herpes Herpes is a virus that currently has no known cure. However, there are therapies that may help alleviate symptoms. The effectiveness and length of epidemics may be mitigated with the use of antiviral medication.
