The Educational Programs Committee (EPC) is charged with creating and reviewing educationalcontent to produce high-quality CE for the AAEP. The committee is composed of AAEP membervolunteers from both small and large private practices as well as academia and industry. Membersinclude both general practitioners and specialists.The San Antonio program includes invited papers for the \"In-depth\" and \"How to\" sessions as well assessions comprised of papers that independent authors submitted for consideration. Topic choices forthe invited \"In Depth\" and \"How To\" sessions are based on member feedback from the 2010 and 2015AAEP CE Needs Analysis surveys. Topic session leaders are selected by the Program Chair, and thenthese session leaders invite a slate of speakers to prepare the papers that become an \"In Depth\"overview or a series of related \"How To\" talks. Although invited, these papers undergo a rigorous peerreview process by the EPC.Papers submitted by independent authors are each assigned 3 reviewers from the EPC. The reviewersdo not know the name(s) of the author(s). Content is scored using the criteria of Study Design, StudyQuality, Innovation and Impact, Practicality, and Manuscript Quality. This year 164 papers weresubmitted for the 55 available slots on the program.Non-scientic sessions addressing business, ethical and industry concerns are also planned as thescientic program materializes. Speakers who are invited to participate in these sessions preparepapers that are also reviewed by members of the EPC for inclusion in the Proceedings.The peer review process for the AAEP Proceedings is rigorous. It requires an enormous effort by everyone of the 50 EPC members to create the best possible program for the AAEP membership. Manyvolunteer hours were spent putting together the San Antonio program, so please thank them for alltheir hard work creating this program for you. ii 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFrom Your President Dear AAEP Members & Guests:Welcome to San Antonio and your 63 rdAnnual Convention.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 vGeneral Instructions for Authors 64thAAEP Convention San Francisco, CA December 1-5, 2018 To submit a paper, go to https://aaep2018.abstractcentral.com ALL papers must be submitted online by March 15, 2018, 3:00 p.m. ET. The AAEP Proceedings is protected by copyright, andinformation submitted and accepted becomes theproperty of AAEP. However, requests for copies or re-prints will be honored by AAEP only with the cooper-ative permission of the presenting author, who by hisor her presentation represents all authors. AAEP re-serves the right not to accept any submission withoutfurther recourse. Presentations for the AAEP Convention will be selected directly from the review-ready submissions to the AAEP.Submissions may include case series with follow-up data, orthe results of experimental or observational studies as sci-entic papers, as well as \"How to\" and review papers. Selec-tion will be made by the Educational Programs Committee.The quality of the submission will determine the selection.Missing data or proposed, but not completed, procedures willexclude the submission from consideration. AAEP invitesinformation dealing with any subject germane to equinepractice, but special consideration will be given to submis-sions by practitioners and material with practical content ornew information. At least one author of a report describingdiagnosis, treatment, or the interpretation of medical infor-mation should be a veterinarian. All submissions should strictly adhere to the Instructions for Authors. Submissions will be ranked using the AAEPScoring Criteria (found at the end of this document) and thehighest-ranking papers will be selected for the available time. Authors are expected to acknowledge all sources of fund- ing or support for the work described and to disclose to theEducational Programs Committee any nancial interest (in-cluding ownership, employment, consultancy arrangements,or service as an ofcer or board member) they have withcompanies that manufacture or sell products that gureprominently in the paper or with companies that manufac-ture or sell competing products. Such an interest will notnecessarily influence the decision to accept or reject a sub-mission for the program, but must be included in the Ac-knowledgments section for the convention Proceedings. Guidelines: Failure to adhere to the following format will result in non-acceptance. It is the author's responsibility to convince theEducational Programs Committee of the value of the submis-sion, as well as to portray to the reader the contents of the presentation. Specic instructions for Scientic papers, \"How to\" papers, Review papers, <250 word abstracts, and Business papers can be found in their respectivesections. Format: 12 point, Times New Roman font Double-spaced 1\" marginsHeadings should include (but are not limited to) the following: 1. Take Home Message2. Introduction3. Materials and Methods4. Results5. Discussion6. Acknowledgments i. Declaration of Ethicsii. Conflicts of Interest 7. References Title: The title should be 15 words or fewer, at the top and on the rstpage. Example:Upper Respiratory Dysfunction in Horses During High SpeedExercise Take Home Message: This should be a concise summary of the main conclusionand should be no longer than two or three sentences (ap-proximately 50 words). \"How to\" papers do not require a take-home message. Example:Local anesthetic injected into the cofn joint is notselective for only this joint. Such injections will desen-sitize much of the navicular bone and its suspensoryligaments. Introduction: The rationale for the submission should be given brieflyand signicant published work acknowledged here. Theclinical signicance should also be included, as well as aclear statement of the objective or purpose of the submis-sion. The statement of objectives is usually found in thelast sentence of the Introduction. Materials and Methods: This section should describe experimental methodology inthe case of a didactic study or, in the case of a clinical study,should include a description of the population from whichthe animals were selected and how they were selected forinclusion in the report. Data obtained and how they were obtained must be de- scribed. A description of the statistical methods used tosummarize data, test hypotheses, and characterize thesignicance of results should also be included. Forweights and measures, metric units should be used. Dos-ages should be expressed entirely in metric units and withspecic time intervals. vi 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSExample:22 mg/kg, q 12 h, IV (not 10mg/lb, BID, IV) Results: Actual results with numbers and data must be presented.When possible, quantify ndings (mean, median, proportion)and present them with appropriate estimates of measure-ment error or uncertainty (such as standard deviation (SD),standard error (SE) or condence interval) in addition to theresults of hypothesis testing. If the data can be well representedwith a graph or gure, these are encouraged if subsequent publication is not anticipated. If numbers and data are notpresented due to concerns regarding publication in a ref-ereed journal, indications of relative differences betweengroups such as odds ratios, % change, and signicantdifferences must be included in the submission to be con-sidered acceptable. In these instances, the authors shouldsubmit the data in the form of means, standard deviations,or other descriptions of comparisons among groups in anappendix, which will not be published and only used forreview purposes. Discussion: Important ndings documented in the results of the studyshould be stated. Results should be related to other workwhich has been done and how the results differ or agreewith previously published work and why any differencesmay have occurred should be discussed. The practical takehome message for the equine practitioner should beclearly dened and stated in the summarizing nal state-ment. This statement may be longer, but should be similarin content to the take home message at the beginning ofthe paper. The following items must be fully explained in the paper: the number of horses that have been worked on, how manywill be affected, and evidence that the procedure works and issafe. Recommended Nomenclature: Anatomy and anatomic planes should be described research (e.g. Grayson- Jockey Club Research Foundation, AQHA Foundation) and technical support forwork performed. Authors are expected to disclose the na-ture of any nancial interests (including ownership, em-ployment, consultancy arrangements, or service as anofcer or board member) they have with companies thatmanufacture or sell products that gure prominently inthe submission or with companies that manufacture orsell competing products. Declaration of Ethics: A Declaration of Ethics statement should be included in thepaper under the Acknowledgements section. Authors mustdeclare if they have adhered to the Principles of VeterinaryMedical Ethics of the AVMA (https://www.avma.org/KB/ Policies/Pages/Principles-of-Veterinary-Medical-Ethics-of- the-AVMA.aspx) 1. If your paper or presentation references the use of a com- pounded pharmaceutical, please be certain that you are fa-miliar with the FDA guidelines on the use of compoundedpharmaceuticals and that the product you reference is incompliance. See section below regarding papers using com-pounded medications or medical devices. 2. All submissions should cite levels of evidence-based med- icine. You should plan to include any ethical considerations as partof your oral presentation if your paper is accepted. Conflicts of Interest: Authors are expected to disclose the nature of any nan-cial interests they have with companies that manufactureor sell products that gure prominently in the submissionor with companies that manufacture or sell competingproducts. (This includes ownership, employment, consul-tancy arrangements, or service as an ofcer or board mem-ber.) A Conflict of Interest statement should be included inthe paper under the Acknowledgments section whether aconflict exists or not. Example of COI StatementConflict of Interest: Dr. John Doe has no conflict ofinterest. Dr. Jane Doe has served as a paid technologyanalyst for the venture capitalists that initiated theformation of Company ABC and served as a member ofthe Board of Directors of Company ABC from its incep-tion until 2008. Company ABC is currently commer-cializing the use of Product XYZ. Dr. Jane Doe has alsoserved as a paid consultant and continues to serve onthe Company ABC Advisory Board. All authors are required to disclose any actual or potentialconflict of interest including any nancial, personal orother relationships with other people or organizationswithin three years of beginning the submitted work thatcould inappropriately influence, or be perceived to influ-ence, their work. At the point of submission, the American Association of Equine Practitioners' (AAEP) policy requires that authorsmust disclose and describe the nature of any actual or po-tential nancial and/or personal relationships they have withcompanies that manufacture or sell products that gureprominently in the submission or with companies that man-ufacture or sell competing products. (This includes owner-ship, employment, consultancy arrangements, or service asan ofcer or board member.) When considering whether aconflicting interest or connection should be declared, theauthor is asked to answer the following: Is there any arrange-ment that would embarrass you or any of your co-authors ifit was to emerge after publication and you had not declaredit? As an integral part of the online submission process, Sub- mitting authors are required to conrm whether they or theirco-authors have any actual or potential conflicts of interest todeclare, and to provide details of these. It is the Submittingauthor's responsibility to ensure that all authors adhere to thispolicy. 1. Any and all authors listed on the paper must disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest 2. Any and all authors listed on the paper must disclose if no conflict exists 3. The nature of the conflict (actual or potential) needs to be described References: References to published works should be limited to what isrelevant and necessary.

Speci-cally, compounded drug or medical devices cannot be used in viii 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSlieu of a FDA-approved product if the approved product has alabel indication for the purpose or condition being evaluatedor described in the abstract. An exception to this policy will be made for abstracts re- porting clinical trials conducted in fulllment of the require-ments for the approval of a new drug (FDA) or biologic(USDA). Submitted papers that use compounded drugs or medical devices will be reviewed by at least two individuals with ex-pertise in this area selected by the CE Steering Committee.The individuals will then make a recommendation to the EPCabout the suitability of the submission for potential inclu-sion in the program. Standard of Care: The AAEP is sensitized to having people use the term \"Stan-dard of Care\" from the podium. If you plan to do this, pleaseinclude this in your abstract or written submitted material sothe EPC can conrm its agreement with your statement.1. A diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clin-ical circumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung can-cer is \"a new standard of care, but not necessarily the onlystandard of care.\" (New England Journal of Medicine,2004). 2. In legal terms, the level at which the average, prudent provider in a given community would practice. It is howsimilarly qualied practitioners would have managed thepatient's care under the same or similar circumstances.The medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the ap-propriate standard of care and demonstrate that the stan-dard of care has been breached. Deadline: ALL papers must be submitted online by March 15,2018, 3:00 p.m. E.T. ; under no circumstances will submis- sions received after the deadline be considered or reviewed.ALL deadlines must be adhered to in order to have the pub-lished Proceedings available at the meeting. Review Process: To respect the integrity of the Annual Convention programand ensure the fairness of the review process, AAEP hasadopted blind reviewing in which the identity of the authorsand reviewers are not known to each other. Papers will bereviewed, scored, and selected by the Educational ProgramsCommittee. Please follow the blinding guidelines below.Blinding Guidelines: The title page and/or front matter of the blinded version of a paper should contain no references to any author or tohis/her afliation. All unpublished works by an author of the submitted man- uscript should be blinded. When referring to an author's publication, the form of third person should be used. Any acknowledgments section should be removed from the blinded version. Also, please delete any notes that indicateafliation, conference presentations, grants, author or de-partmental websites, etc. Do not use author name or afliation in the names of the submitted les. Scoring Criteria: One goal of the Educational Programs Committee (EPC) inchoosing submissions for the AAEP annual meeting is tocombine the best available clinical research with clinicalexperience and expertise to meet the needs of our patients.The AAEP Scoring Criteria can be found at https://aaep2018.abstractcentral.com/. Pre-Press Approval: Authors will have nal approval at the page proof stage.Changes/updates in numbers, dosages or inappropriategrammar may be made within one week of receiving pageproofs. Final grammatical changes will be the decision of theeditors. Substantial changes or removal of any data will re-sult in forfeiture of complimentary registration and travel,and exclusion from the program. Reimbursement: Presenting authors will receive one complimentary registra-tion and a reimbursement of $550 to help support travel. Mentors for Authors: Paper submissions by private practitioners and rst-timeauthors are highly encouraged. The AAEP has a list of mem-bers in various areas of expertise who have agreed to volun-teer their time to mentor an author who needs guidance. Tosee this list, email Carey Ross at cross@aaep.org.

Authors who do not intend to publish in a refereed journal are welcome to submit a Scientic Paper. Scientic Paper selection will be made by the Educational Programs Committee. The quality of the Scientic Paper willdetermine the selection. Missing data or proposed, but notcompleted, procedures will exclude the Scientic Paper orother paper from consideration. AAEP invites informationdealing with any subject germane to equine practice, butspecial consideration will be given to presentations by prac-titioners and material with practical content or new informa-tion. At least one author of a report describing diagnosis,treatment, or the interpretation of medical informationshould be a veterinarian. Scientic papers should be formatted as described in the General Instructions for Authors. Scientic papers shouldbe no fewer than 600 words, with no upper word limit. The \"How to\" Paper: Guidelines for Authors 64thAAEP Convention San Francisco, CA December 1-5, 2018 To submit a paper, go to https://aaep2018.abstractcentral.com ALL papers must be submitted online by March 15, 2018, 3:00 p.m. ET. \"How to\" papers are presented to describe and explain atechnique or procedure used in equine veterinary medicine AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 ixor the equine industry. The technique should be relativelynew or not widely understood or used in practice. The goal ofthe \"How to\" paper is to give equine veterinarians the infor-mation they need to critically evaluate the pros and cons ofthe technique and implement it in their practice if theychoose. \"How to\" papers can be patterned after a modication of the style for a Scientic Paper supporting a scientic presen-tation. Refer to General Instructions for Authors as you pre-pare your submission. How to papers should be no fewerthan 600 words, with no upper word limit. The title should begin with \"How to . . .\" and clearly iden- tify the technique or procedure that will be presented. A\"Take Home Message\" is not required for \"How to\" papers.The Introduction should include why you use the technique.If there is a problem with the traditional methods or if thecurrently used method can be improved, this should beexplained. The Materials and Methods section should explain exactly how the technique is performed so that another veterinarianfamiliar with the subject area could follow your example. Youmay use a step-by-step method for the paper and the presen-tation. All medications, supplies, and equipment usedshould be described using generic names. Trade names andaddresses of commercial products critical to the techniquecan be included in footnotes. The Results section should include a summary of what happens when you use this technique. The number of horsestreated in this manner and an assessment of the outcomeshould be included. You may use personal assertions or datato assert its value, but you must explain how you determinedthat the technique works.

The end of the discussionshould contain a summary of the technique and its advan-tages in the take home message. Case selection, case studynumber, and case follow-up should all be included. Review Paper: Guidelines for Authors 64thAAEP Convention San Francisco, CA December 1-5, 2018 To submit a paper, go to https://aaep2018.abstractcentral.com ALL papers must be submitted online by March 15, 2018, 3:00 p.m. ET. Review papers are presented for the purpose of updating themembership on a new subject or for gathering informationthat may be conflicting. The aim of the paper is to help themembership put the information in perspective, and to makejudgments on conflicting information. A review paper will notprincipally present original data; the goal is to clarify existingknowledge on a subject and help the membership better usethe information in their day-to-day practice. Review papers should generally be formatted as described in the \"Instructions for Authors of Manuscripts\" exceptwhere otherwise noted here. The paper should be titled \"Re-view of Some Subject.\" The content of review articles shouldbe organized with headings and subheadings that provide alogical flow to the material presented. A \"Take Home Mes-sage\" is required for a Review Paper. The Introduction shoulddene the subject matter and put it in context, explainingwhy the review is necessary. The purpose of the review papershould be clearly stated in the Introduction. Agreement and disagreement within the subject matter should be identied along with the strengths and limitationsof the information sources. Reference should be made to theauthors who generally support the opinions stated. The au-thor's perspective, including his/her own interpretation ofthe information if it is different from previously publishedopinions, should be included. The end of the discussionshould contain a summary and the conclusion that the au-thor has drawn for the audience, based upon the revieweddata. As with a Scientic Paper, a \"Take Home Message\"should be provided by the author that summarizes the prac-tical application of the information for the practitioner. An appropriately complete reference list should be in- cluded. The format for references is the same as that de-scribed in \"General Instructions for Authors.\" Review papersshould be no fewer than 600 words, with no upper word limit. Illustrations should be provided in the format described in \"General Instructions for Authors\". If previously publishedmaterial is submitted, including text, photographs or draw-ings, the author must acknowledge the original source andsubmit written permission from the copyright holders (au-thor and publisher) to reproduce the material. This permis-sion must accompany the original manuscript at the time ofsubmission.

To encourage submission of the newest scientic informa-tion for inclusion in the AAEP Annual Convention programand simultaneously not jeopardize future publication of thismaterial in a refereed journal, the following criteria havebeen developed for these submissions of Scientic Papersthat will be published in the AAEP Proceedings. In such instances, the published abstract can be /H11349250 words. However, these \"abbreviated abstracts\" should followa structured format with the same subheadings (Take HomeMessage, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results andDiscussion) as the full-length scientic paper.

The goal of these papers is to give equine veterinariansthe information they need to critically evaluate the pros andcons of the technique and implement it in their practice ifthey choose. \"How to\" papers should follow the same guidelines in this document, except where otherwise noted below. The Title should begin with \"How to . . .\" and clearly iden- tify the technique or procedure that will be presented. A \"Take Home Message\" is not required for \"How to\" papers. The Introduction should include why you use the technique. If there is a problem with the traditional methods or the cur-rently used method can be improved, this should be explained. The Materials and Methods section should explain exactly how the technique is performed so that another veterinarianfamiliar with the subject area could follow your example. Youmay use a step-by-step method for the paper and thepresentation. The Results section should include a summary of what happens when you use this technique. You may use personalassertions or data to assert its value, but you must explainhow you determined that the technique works. In the Discussion section, you can give your personal views as to why you think the technique works. Discuss thepros and cons of your approach. Explain how the techniqueis helpful and why this should be important to your col-leagues.

Introduction A current understanding of the different types oflaminitis is critical to the examination of not onlyanimals at risk of laminitis, but any animal exhib-iting lameness. Due to a rapidly increasing knowl-edge base regarding the different types of laminitis,we now have very few cases that cannot be placed inone of the three types of laminitis: endocrinopathiclaminitis the most common type seen by theambulatory practitioner, has enjoyed the greatestknowledge gain in the past decade. Whereas it wasa large step forward to identify the classic phenotypeof horses at risk of endocrinopathic laminitis (i.e.,the obese, cresty-necked horse or pony or the aginghorse exhibiting PPID-related signs such as hirsut-ism), there were still laminitis cases that did notseem to t well in these categories of endocrino-pathic laminitis but also did not have the history orcharacteristics of sepsis-related or supporting-limblaminitis. The combination of advancements in ourunderstanding of the role insulin dysregulationplays in all types of endocrinopathic laminitis, andthe advancements in testing for insulin dysregula-tion allowed larger studies to determine the horsesat risk for endocrinopathic laminitis. It is now re-alized that, very similar to human metabolic syn-drome, genetics likely plays as important a role asbody condition in EMSAL. Therefore, there can beobese animals with normal insulin regulation thatare of little risk of laminitis due to their individualgenetics, and other horses that are of relativelynormal body condition (i.e., \"show shape\") thathave both insulin dysregulation and EMSAL.Just as some human races are much more prone tometabolic syndrome than others, we realize thatcertain horse risk of equine metabolic syn- drome (EMS). Thus, especially may exhibit insulin dysregulation andendocrinopathic laminitis without outward obesity. Whereas the disease is not as common in breedssuch as Thoroughbreds and Quarter Horses, it cer-tainly still occurs in these breeds (most likely due toa combination of individual genetics as well as obe-sity). It has recently been reported that, even inhorses with PPID, the only ones at risk of laminitisare those with concurrent insulin dysregulation. 1 The culmination of this work results in the realitythat, although many equids with EMSAL 63 classic presentation of being an at-risk breedsuffering from obesity, many of a subset of animalsthat exhibit signs of laminitis but do not obviously tinto one of the three types are eventually diagnosedwith insulin dysregulation (commonly via dynamicinsulin testing) and thus can be classied as havingendocrinopathic laminitis. The other discovery in the last few years that greatly impacts our physical examination ndingswhen evaluating the laminitis suspect is that, insharp distinction to the rapid and severely painfulfailure of lamellar support (and resulting displace-ment of the [DP]) that commonlyaccompanies in endocrinopathic laminitis commonly oc-curs in such a subtle and gradual fashion that thedisease may go unnoticed until mild lameness due tosolear issues (e.g., bruising) seems due to pressure ofthe displaced DP on the solear tissue. 2Although there are still many cases of pasture-associatedlaminitis (part of endocrinopathic laminitis) inwhich the disease becomes obvious after exposure toa lush pasture, there are many horses that have ahistory consistent with performing well in differentathletic endeavors while displacement of the DP waslikely occurring, and the horse is brought to theveterinarian for a diagnostic evaluation of a mildbilateral forelimb lameness. Another advancementthat has greatly aided in our diagnosis of more sub-tle cases is a large amount of literature setting bet-ter guidelines for radiographic identication ofdisplacement of the DP. 3 In general, there are three presentations associated with laminitis with which the veterinarian is con-fronted: 1) acute onset of a primary episode of lami-nitis, usually characterized by severe lameness, 2)the case of moderate lameness in animals with aknown history of laminitis, and 3) the case of mildlameness of unknown origin (commonly bilateralforelimb lameness). 1) The Acute Onset of a Primary Episode of Laminitis withSevere Lameness The acute onset of laminitis with severe lameness inaffected feet is most commonly observed in casesof sepsis-related and supporting-limb laminitis.Because these animals have usually not previouslyhad laminitis, the hoof wall usually appears normalin these animals. However, the animals are com-monly exhibiting 1) an elevated heart rate, 2)warmth in the affected feet with prominent digitalpulses, 3) treading of the affected feet, and 4) amoderate-to-marked resistance the veterinarian at-tempting to pick up a foot opposite to the affectedfoot. Whereas the disease affects either both frontfeet or all four feet in sepsis-related laminitis, thedisease only affects one foot (the foot contralateral toa limb which the animal is unable to bear normalweight) in supporting-limb laminitis. In addition,whereas laminitis commonly occurs 24 to 72 hoursafter the onset of systemic sepsis in sepsis-relatedlaminitis, supporting-limb laminitis may occurwithin 3 days of severe lameness in the contralaterallimb, or may not occur until 4 to 6 weeks of pref-erential weight bearing on the supporting limb.Once supporting-limb laminitis is present, thereis most commonly catastrophic failure of the la-mellae and rapid displacement of the DP. In arecent survey (performed by the author) of sur-geons in private practice and teaching hospitals inthe United States and Canada, the most commoncause of supporting-limb laminitis was a septic ten- don sheath or joint in the opposite limb. Whereassepsis-related laminitis is most commonly secondaryto severe gastrointestinal torsion, enterocolitis, etc.) in referral hospitals, itcan be seen with relative frequency in practice (com-monly within 48 to 72 hours) following grain over-load or the onset of retained placenta/acute metritis.There are a number of cases of the pasture-associ-ated laminitis component of endocrinopathic lamin-itis in which animals may exhibit acute and severesigns if suddenly exposed to an excessive amountof high-energy feed (commonly in the form of lushpasture). There is controversy about whetherthese acute exacerbations are actually due to en-docrinopathic causes (i.e., an exaggerated insulinresponse) or whether the animals may consumeenough carbohydrate to cause hindgut distur-bance (similar to grain overload) leading to sepsis-related laminitis. 2) The Case of Moderate Lameness in Animals with aKnown History of Laminitis This type of presentation can occur in all three typesof laminitis, with animals commonly presentingmonths to years after the initial episode of laminitis.A major difference is that there has usually onlybeen one bout of laminitis in cases of sepsis-relatedand supporting-limb laminitis, and the lamellae areusually stable (and not the cause of pain) at the timeof examination in these patients. The currentlameness is usually due to subsolear pressure fromdisplacement of the DP, which has not been ade-quately corrected since the original episode of lami-nitis. Whereas this presentation is also commonwith endocrinopathic laminitis, the major differenceis that many of not intensivelymanaged nutritionally\u2014have commonly sufferedmultiple bouts of laminar insult since the initialepisode, and may have ongoing lamellar injury.Most of the horses with this presentation, regardlessof the type of laminitis leading to it, have hoof wallchanges from a chronic displacement (i.e., dishing ofthe dorsal wall if chronic capsular rotation). Theseanimals rarely have the acute signs of laminitis pulses, warm feet, treading of feet); theyare commonly lamer when walked on a hard surface,especially tight circles. 2 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMINITIS3) The Case of Mild Lameness of Unknown Origin(Commonly Bilateral Forelimb) Due to the insidious nature of displacement of theDP and an associated insidious nature to subse-quent lameness exhibited by the animals in endocri-nopathic laminitis, it should be on the differentiallist of any lameness exam. As the forelimbs aremost commonly affected in endocrinopathic lamini-tis, the disease should be high on the list in horseswith bilateral forelimb lameness in which naviculardisease/palmar heel pain is commonly the primaryconcern of owners and trainers. In an animal ei-ther exhibiting the characteristics of equine meta-bolic syndrome (obesity, hoof wall abnormalities), orresponding in the toe region to hoof testers (rare fornavicular disease), endocrinopathic laminitis shouldclimb higher on the differential list. As it has nowbeen well published that the palmar digital nerveblock not only anesthetizes the heel but also anes-thetizes the entire sole 4and vast majority of the hoof wall/lamellae,5nerve blocks are not usually helpful in differentiating between palmar heel pain and soleor hoof wall/lamellar pain. The most accurate di-agnostic technique is navicular bursal block/anes-thesia; however, pain emanating from the dorsalaspect of the sole (common with solear pressure withdisplacement of the DP) is also anesthetized within10 minutes of performing the navicular bursa anes-thesia technique. 6Thus, whereas many practitio - ners concentrate on radiographic assessment of thenavicular bone in horses with forelimb lameness,which to either digital nerve mea-surements 3on lateral (and possibly dorsopalmar) views is important in these cases to assess for dis-placement of the DP indicative of a lameness result-ing from endocrinopathic laminitis. The Initial Exam When rst assessing a horse for laminitis, the initialtreatment plan depends on an accurate history andpreliminary general physical exam to determineboth 1) whether the horse is truly suffering fromlaminitis, and 2) the severity and type of laminitis(e.g., sepsis-related vs. endocrinopathic vs. support-ing limb) the animal is experiencing if it is present.The relevant history will include the timing (espe-cially regarding season/forage available) and sever-ity of lameness exhibited by the horse both recentlyand in the past, the animal's diet and body conditionduring the past year, any recent history of a bacte-rial infection in any organ that may lead to systemicsepsis (e.g., colitis, retained placenta, pleuropneu-monia). In the animal in which signs of laminitisare limited to one limb, the history of a disease orinjury causing lameness in the opposite limb is im-portant. A physical exam is indicated to assessfactors possibly putting the animal at risk for thedifferent types of laminitis (i.e., obesity, fever, etc.).The heart rate is extremely important to obtaininitially. Although the primary cause for an increased heart rate is pain due to laminitis, the clinicianneeds to make sure that it is not due to systemiccauses related to systemic sepsis. The mucousmembranes and rectal temperature are the easiestand fastest way to obtain an initial assessment ofsepsis-related disease. With pink membranes anda normal rectal temperature (pain does not causeincreased rectal temperature in most horses), anytachycardia is likely due to pain. Another test is, ifnerve blocks are performed to obtain radiographsand examine the sole surfaces of the feet, to retakethe heart rate post nerve block. In the author'sview, the heart rate (if not complicated by sepsis) isthe most valuable physical parameter regarding as-sessment of the horse's duress. Whereas heartrates in the range of 45 to 55 beats per minute arecommon with moderate pain in laminitis cases,heart rates in the 60s\u2014and especially those in the70s and 80s\u2014are of great concern to the author notonly regarding humane concerns but also prognosis. The Lameness Exam The lameness exam will vary greatly on the degreeof lameness the horse is exhibiting. In the severelylame animal in which it is difcult to pick up a foot,no lameness exam is necessary. However, if tem-porary nerve blocks are performed on the front feetfor initial assessment and treatment (discussed be-low), the horse can be walked a limited number ofsteps to determine whether there is involvement ofthe hindlimb digits. In the moderately lame horsein which there is a history of laminitis, a lamenessexam is usually performed at a walk in a straightline and a gure eight both on a hard and softsurface to assess the relative degree of lameness ineach limb (usually forelimbs). The author educatesowners that horses that have suffered previous la-mellar injury/DP displacement are commonly pain-ful when torque is applied to the hoof capsule for therest of the animal's life; circling or walking in agure eight on a hard surface such as asphalt willalways apply torque to the hoof capsule (especiallythe foot on the inside of the circle) due to the pur-chase of the hard surface on the solear surface of thehoof capsule. Thus, although we usually performthis procedure on a hard surface to assess the rela-tive amount of pain exhibited on the different limbs,it is more important clinically to assess the animalon a soft surface in which there is more give of theground surface and therefore less torque applied tothe hoof capsule. In the mild lameness case inwhich endocrinopathic laminitis is a possibility, amore routine lameness exam at a walk and trot maybe performed. However, it is best to perform anyexam at a trot on a soft surface to avoid exacerbatingany lamellar injury due to excessive impact on ahard surface. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 3IN-DEPTH: LAMINITISExamination of the Digits Examination of the digits includes an examinationof the external hoof wall, the coronary band (includ-ing the integument proximal to the coronary band),and, importantly, the ground surface of the foot.In the acute, severe case of laminitis, the hoof wall iscommonly normal due to the acute nature of onset ofdisease in supporting limb laminitis and sepsis-re-lated laminitis. However, the hoof wall is muchmore likely to exhibit abnormalities in cases of en-docrinopathic laminitis due to the disease commonlyhaving a more chronic nature (months to years).The changes may include 1) dishing of the dorsalaspect of the hoof wall (due to capsular rotation ofthe DP) and 2) rings (commonly called\"growth rings\") likely correlating to exacerbations ofthe disease process over the past several months.A close visual examination of the coronary band mayreveal separation from the hoof wall. It is impor-tant to document the degree of separation circum-ferentially, and the character of exudate from anyseparation. A focal region with a purulent exudatemay suggest a \"gravel\" (an abscess that has traveledup the white line and ruptured at the coronaryband), whereas hemorrhagic exudate commonlysuggests a more serious cause, frequently emanat-ing from extensive separation of the lamellar tissue(commonly with displacement of the DP). Finally,palpation of the tissue immediately proximal to thecoronary band may reveal a \"trough\" where distaldisplacement of the aspect of the DP adjacent to thatarea has resulted in depression of the soft tissue.The location of either hemorrhage of the coronaryband or a \"trough\" in the soft tissue may give someindication of the type of displacement: abnormali-ties dorsally commonly suggest dorsal rotation of theDP, circumferential commonly occurwith symmetrical distal displacement of the DP, andabnormalities primarily on one side of the foot (mostcommonly medial) may suggest asymmetrical distaldisplacement of the DP. The solear surface is examined for any abnor- malities including disruptions in sole, the integ-rity of the white line, and the health of the frog.In the horse in which the feet can be picked up toexamine the ground surface without the use ofnerve blocks, assessment of solear pain providesvaluable information for diagnosis and manage-ment of the case. Digital pressure (with the cli-nician's thumbs) is rst applied around the entiresole to detect either pain or palpable evidence of athinned sole or underlying seroma. If the solepalpates to be relatively intact, hoof testers can beapplied to the digit to further assess areas of pain.Hoof testers should not be placed on areas of solethat palpate to be abnormal on digital pressure asthey may result in injury/perforation of the sole.The areas of pain are not only important for ob-taining a full clinical picture of the distal displace-ment of the DP (i.e., toe pain with the DP and solear pain withasymmetrical distal displacement of the DP), butalso in determining the areas of the ground sur-face of the foot that can be recruited with tech-niques such as application of cushion supportmaterial to support the digit. The clinician needsto limit the time a foot is elevated for examinationto avoid causing further lamellar injury to theopposite foot. Any areas of solear perforationthat are present should be assessed to determinewhether the disruption is due to a subsolear ab-scess (common in the chronic laminitis case), per-foration of the sole due to severe displacement ofthe DP, or both; radiographs will also assist withthis determination. Although many veterinarians are resistant to per- form nerve blocks on laminitis cases, the author willperform a short-acting nerve block (with lidocaine)in animals too painful to pick up their feet (evenunder the effects of detomidine analgesia/sedation)in order to decrease their duress during the examand increase the ease of obtaining radiographs, per-forming a rapid but thorough examination of thesole, and applying the type of temporary shoeing/padding indicated by the exam and radiographs.In the author's experience, performing the block byanesthetizing the palmar nerves in the mid-cannonregion is commonly easier to perform and lessstressful to the horse than attempting to block thefeet with the more distal nerve blocks. In the verypainful horse, nerve blocks decrease the duress forthe animal and the time needed to perform neces-sary procedures, and increase the safety for the care-givers assisting with the animals. The foot notbeing examined is placed in a commercial paddedshoe ato minimize the trauma to that foot while the other foot is being examined/treated. If the nerveblock has not worn off by the time the exam andinitial treatment is performed, the horse is re-strained from excessive movement until sensationreturns to the digit. As nerve blocks will not allowan assessment of solear pain in the feet, it may bebest to only block one foot at rst so that the otherfoot can be picked up and the solear surface exam-ined for localization of pain. After examination of the foot, radiographs should be performed. Whereas the lateral and dorsopal-mar views are the critical views in the severe, acutecase of laminitis, a solar margin view (60\u00b0 dorsopal-mar oblique view taken with the horse weight bear-ing on a cassette) is important for assessing theintegrity of the DP in the long-standing case. Bothfront feet are placed on wooden blocks to obtain alateral and dorsopalmar view, with the radiographicbeam centered approximately 1 cm proximal to theground surface of the foot. The radiographs arecritical for 1) determining whether displacement ofthe DP has occurred, 2) assessing the severity ofdisplacement (and therefore prognosis), 3) detectingsigns of chronicity/prior bouts of laminitis, and 4)assessing the type of displacement 4 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMINITIStant for of foot care applied to the affectedfeet). 3 Acknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri-nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

Diagnostic Testing for Equine PPID PPID is a common endocrinopathy of aged horses.Severe or chronic PPID is typically not a diagnosticchallenge, given that the diagnosis can often besuggested by clinical signs alone. The presence ofhypertrichosis (formerly hirsutism) is considered pa-thognomonic for PPID, particularly in geriatrichorses ( /H1102218-20 years of age). In study, this nding had 71% sensitivity, 95% specicity, 91%positive predictive value, and 84% negative pre-dictive value for diagnosing the disease where adenitive diagnosis was based on postmortem ex-amination ndings. 1The clinical presentation ofPPID in younger horses (or those in early stages ofthe disease) is more variable, and diagnosis of thesecases is more challenging and often relies heavily onthe results of diagnostic testing. Tests for laboratoryevaluation of PPID cases have evolved over the years;recommended tests have included measurement ofresting serum or plasma cortisol, (ACTH), /H9251-melanocyte-stimulating hormone insulin concentrations, theACTH stimulation test, the 19-hour (overnight)dexamethasone suppression test (DST), the thyro-tropin-releasing hormone (TRH)- stimulation test, and the combined DST/TRH stimulation tests. Other methods that have been evaluated include thedomperidone response test, salivary cortisol con-centrations, and assessment ACTH(eACTH), the TRH stimulation test, and the DSTare thought to be the most reliable means of estab-lishing a diagnosis of PPID in a clinical patient, witheACTH and the TRH stimulation are most com- monly used clinically. Before testing, it is impor-tant to know about the patient's managementconditions, diet (including how recently the horsewas fed), medication history, and degree of phys- 6 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMINITIS NOTESiologic stress (as far as it can be known), whichcould potentially influence test results. Season isanother factor that must be considered, given thatthe secretory activity of the equine pars interme-dia varies throughout the year, with highest out-put noted during the late summer and autumnmonths in the northern hemisphere (July-Novem-ber). 2Specic tests are described more fully below. Routine Lab Work A complete blood count, serum biochemistry evalu-ation, brinogen/serum amyloid A, and urinalysiscan be useful to comprehensively evaluate the im-mune, endocrine, and metabolic status of horseswith PPID. with PPID havenormal bloodwork, abnormalities commonly associ-ated with glycemia is frequently observed in these cases butnot consistently enough to be diagnostically useful.The mild-to-moderate hyperglycemia in horses withPPID may be secondary to cortisol-mediated sys-temic insulin resistance, but many other endocrinefactors may also be involved (such as ACTH, /H9251-MSH, leptin, ghrelin, GH, IGF-I). Hypertriglyceride-mia may be noted and is reportedly more common inaffected ponies than in horses. 4,5Severe hypertri - glyceridemia accompanying endocrine disease is of-ten associated with insulin resistance in equids butcan resolve with appropriate therapy. 6 eACTH Concentration Horses PPID have ACTH is a good screening test for diagnosis ofPPID, although the clinician should be aware thatvalues may fall within the reference range in earlyor mild disease. In one study using the DST as thegold standard, resting ACTH concentrations had asensitivity of 91% in and 82% in ponies and aspecicity of 100%. 7Other publications have re - ported lower and higher sensitivities and specici-ties for this test. 8,9Similar to cortisol, ACTH concentrations can be increased by stress and bloodglucose concentration. Basal [ACTH] /H1102258 pg/mL had of 79% topredict laminitic episodes in ponies in one study. 10 In the northern hemisphere, ACTH concentra- tions in healthy equids are higher in the late sum-mer and fall than in spring months, 2and recently, seasonally adjusted reference ranges have beenestablished for this test. In fall months (July-November), most healthy ponies and horses haveACTH concentrations below 100 ( /H1101122 ACTH concentrations depending on thespecic immunoassay used, but the current consen-sus is that for the period of November through July,concentrations /H1102235 pg/mL measured by the immu- nochemiluminescent assay support a diagnosis ofPPID. For the period July through November, anACTH concentration /H11022100 pg/mL is strongly sup- portive of PPID, whereas values between 50 and 100pg/mL are considered suspicious and justify repeatevaluation 3-6 months later. It has been shownthat basal ACTH and /H9251-MSH concentrations have better sensitivity and specicity for diagnosis ofPPID in the fall when compared with other times ofthe year, and it has therefore been recommendedthat testing via these modalities should be ideallyperformed at this time of the year; however, /H9251-MSH is not currently a commercially available diagnostictest. 9Fed state has also been shown to affect base - line and TRH-stimulated ACTH concentrations (fedhorses have higher resting and post-TRH ACTHconcentrations than non-fed horses); however, noinfluence of the time of the day at which testing wasperformed was observed on baseline or stimulatedACTH concentrations. 12Recommendations for standardization of dietary preparation prior to PPIDtesting are needed. To perform this test, blood should be collected in EDTA-containing tubes (preferably plastic), keptchilled on ice prior to transport, or centrifuged andfrozen until harvested plasma can be analyzed.When collected in plastic EDTA tubes, equine ACTHis stable for 8 hours in whole blood, and for a longerperiod of time if plasma is separated and frozenpromptly. 13Freezing and thawing have minimal effect on ACTH concentrations.14ACTH concen - tration tends to be lower in samples collected inglass tubes, but this difference is minimal 14; overall, equine ACTH is more stable than previously believed.If basal eACTH concentrations are supportive of adiagnosis of PPID, there does not seem to be additionalbenet of performing other more complex tests to se-cure the diagnosis (e.g., TRH stimulation). 8 TRH-Stimulation Test The TRH-stimulation test was developed based onthe concept that exogenous TRH administration tohorses with PPID would result in greater cortisolsecretion when compared with unaffected horses. 15 This effect of TRH seems to be due to its ability toincrease release of POMC-derived peptides secretion of /H9251-MSH and ACTH in healthy horses and horses with PPID, but concentrations are greater and moreprolonged in horses with PPID. 8This effect seems to be more profound for /H9251-MSH than for ACTH in horses with PPID, and /H9251-MSH concentrations seem to remain elevated longer.8In healthy horses, ACTH and /H9251-MSH release following TRH adminis- tration exhibits seasonal variation, with higher val-ues measured in summer and fall months compared AAEP PROCEEDINGS 63 /H114082017 ACTH concentrationsafter TRH administration more diagnos-tically accurate than measuring post-TRH cortisol indifferentiating normal horses from those withPPID. 17For example, in horses with PPID, TRH (1 mg, IV) induced a /H1101110-fold increase in ACTH con- centrations at 4-14 minutes post-administration,whereas in healthy horses, the increase was /H110112- fold. 8,17The increase in cortisol concentration at 14 and 30 minutes was minimal in both PPID andhealthy horses. 17/H9251-MSH seems to behave simi- larly when measured post-TRH, but there is noevidence that /H9251-MSH is superior to ACTH if mea- surements are done within 30 minutes of TRH ad-ministration. 8There is no commercially available TRH product labeled for this use in horses cur-rently; however, chemical-grade TRH powder canbe purchased from a number companies, in saline solution, lter sterilized, andfrozen in 1-mg aliquots until use. Veterinarycompounding pharmacies can also prepare TRH asan injectable solution that is reasonably stable atroom temperature. c18 To perform the TRH-stimulation test, a baseline blood sample should be collected (plastic EDTAtubes), followed by administration of TRH (1 mg perhorse, IV); additional blood samples should be col-lected at 10 and 30 minutes post-TRH administra-tion, and the baseline and either or both post-TRHsamples should be submitted for ACTH concentra-tions. ACTH concentrations higher than 75 pg/mL(16.5 pmol/L) at 30 minutes post-TRH administra-tion suggest PPID when testing is performed fromNovember through July. If samples are collected at10 minutes post-TRH, ACTH values can be inter-preted as follows: not supportive of PPID if /H1102185 pg/mL PPID if ACTH values between and110 pg/mL 10 minutes post-dosing may be good can-didates for repeat testing in 6-8 weeks. If samplesare collected at 30 minutes post-TRH, ACTH valuesgreater than 65 pg/mL are supportive of PPID.Importantly, there are no seasonally adjusted refer-ence ranges available for interpretation of this testcurrently, so the test should not be performed fromJuly to November. Side effects that may be ob-served in horses after TRH administration includeyawning, lip movements, salivation, and trem-bling. 18The test does not seem to be signicantly affected by fed state, thus dietary preparation islikely not necessary prior to testing. 19Regarding the TRH stimulation test, the following two strate-gies should be avoided: 1) concurrent testing for IDvia the oral sugar test (OST; as it may confoundresults), and 2) repeating the TRH-stimulation testsat less than 24-hour intervals. 18,19 The TRH stimulation test is becoming the method of choice to diagnose PPID for equine practitionersbecause it provides reliable results, does not takemuch time, evaluates pituitary and adrenal glandfunction (and can be used to assess thyroid function,if desired), and is not associated with any signicantknown complications. In addition to sampling at10 and 30 minutes for ACTH measurements, sam-ples can be collected at 2 and 4 hours to determineT3 and T4 concentrations, allowing evaluation ofmultiple endocrine axes if clinically indicated. /H9251-MSH Similar to ACTH, resting /H9251-MSH a similar secretion pattern in healthyand PPID-affected horses throughout the year. 16 Resting /H9251-MSH concentration has the potential to become a routine diagnostic test for PPID; however,commercial assays are not readily available cur-rently and at this point, it is often expensive tomeasure. Currently, /H9251-MSH concentrations in horses are only determined for research purposes.It is recommended to collect blood samples in EDTA-containing tubes. Normal seasonal values forplasma /H9251-MSH in healthy and PPID horses have been published.8,20Reported sensitivities and specicities 93%, the same group of horses, 30 minutes after TRH stimulation, sensitiv-ities and specicities using the /H9251-MSH re - sponse to TRH stimulation does not confer majordiagnostic advantage over baseline /H9251-MSH values; this is different to the ACTH response to TRH,which has improved diagnostic value over baselineACTH concentrations. DST The DST has historically been the most widely usedmethod in the diagnosis of equine PPID. 3The ra - tionale behind this test in PPID-affectedhorses and ponies, and ACTH is primarily of the pars intermedia; these cells (whichare hyperplastic and display more active secretionin PPID) are not sensitive to negative feedback byglucocorticoids, which in this setting is diagnosti-cally useful. In healthy equids, ACTH is primar-ily secreted by the corticotrophs of the parsdistalis, which are subject to negative feedback byglucocorticoids. To perform a 19-hour DST, a baseline serum sam- ple should be collected (between 4-6 pm), followedby administration of dexamethasone (40 /H9262g/kg, IM). A second serum sample should be collected 19 hourslater ( /H1101112:00 pm). In horses with intact negative feedback sensitivity, it is expected that serumcortisol concentrations will be below 1 /H9262g/dL (27.6 nmol/L) 19 hours post-dexamethasone administra-tion, whereas horses with minimal 8 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMINITIScortisol suppression. This test is simple, inexpen-sive, and continues to be performed frequently byequine practitioners; however, seasonally ad-justed reference ranges for interpretation are notavailable for this test, and false-positive tests mayoccur if animals are tested in autumn. This testshould not be performed between the months ofJuly and November in the northern hemispherefor this reason. Clinicians should be aware that false-positive and false-negative results occur with the DST. Falsepositives (20-40%) are common when testing isdone in the fall (as with the TRH stimulation test,there are no seasonally adjusted reference rangesagainst which to interpret the DST currently),whereas false negatives may occur early in the dis-ease process. For horses with clinical evidence ofPPID and a non-diagnostic DST, it is recommendedto repeat testing 4-6 months later, or consider othertests. With regard to the risk of laminitis associ-ated with corticosteroid administration, whereas anassociation between has been suggested, no controlled studyhas quantied this risk well. When performed in66 horses with evidence of PPID, the DST did notinduce or worsen any signs of laminitis. 21Despite the lack of objective information (including lack of anexperimental model for induction of corticosteroid-associated laminitis), disclosure of risk to clients (however small) is important prior to performing the test. If a veterinarian or client is worried aboutcomplications associated with the DST, other meth-ods (e.g., eACTH concentration, TRH-stimulationtest) are available. The DST is gradually beingsupplanted by these other methods that are moretime efcient and accurate in achieving a diagnosisof PPID. Other diagnostic tests (such as a combined DST/ TRH-stimulation test, baseline cortisol concentra-tions, the ACTH ratios, and glucose concen-trations, and the domperidone stimulation test)have been developed and evaluated for their utilityin clinical diagnosis of equine PPID; however, nonehave been shown to have superior performance tothe eACTH, TRH stimulation, or the DST and thusare not currently recommended. 3. Diagnostic Testing for EMS Equine metabolic syndrome is among the mostcommon endocrine disorders of horses and iscurrently dened as overweight/obese body condi-tion, clinicopathologic evidence of ID, and lamini-tis (historical or current). Diagnostic testing forthe syndrome is primarily related to identicationof abnormalities in insulin and glucose dynamics,which will be the focus of the following discussion. Adiposity and Body-Condition Scoring Obesity is detected upon physical examination of thehorse and determining a body condition score (BCS;1-9). 22Regional adiposity is commonly detected in insulin resistant (IR) horses, and mean neck circum-ference has been negatively correlated with insulinsensitivity in obese horses with IR. 23Neck circum - ference can be measured with a tape measure.These measurements are made by dividing the dis-tance along a line from the poll to the cranial aspectof the withers (x) by four and measuring the circum-ference of the neck at three equidistant points(0.25x, 0.50x, and 0.75x). Expansion of the adiposetissue within the neck is commonly referred to as a\"cresty neck\" and, with the exception of stallions,this nding is suggestive of IR in horses. 23 Enlarged fat deposits may also be found close to the tail head or appear as randomly distributed sub-cutaneous swellings. Geldings are sometimes pre-sented for evaluation of preputial swelling, and mares may show enlargement of the mammary glands. Both of these problems are related to adi-pose tissue accumulation, which can also interferewith lymphatic return in these regions. Affectedhorses can develop edema in these areas as wellwhen they are left standing in their stall for too long,and this problem typically improves with exercise.Supraorbital fat accumulation is also a frequentnding. EMS is sometimes recognized when horsesdevelop other medical problems, including colic, hy- perlipemia, and reproductive dysfunction. Obesityhas also been associated with abnormal reproduc-tive cycling in mares, although fertility seems to berelatively unaffected for the most part. 24 Regional adiposity/obesity is a diagnostic criterion for EMS, but it must be recognized that fat redistri-bution is also seen in older horses with PPID. 3 It is therefore necessary to examine the patient forclinical signs of PPID, including horses withinsulin resistance/ID are obese or overweight. Laminitis and EMS Horses with EMS commonly suffer from laminitis,which is recognized when lameness is detected, hooftesters are applied to the feet, or pedal radiographsare performed. Divergent growth rings indicatingabnormal hoof growth can be observed in horseswith or without a documented clinical history oflaminitis. Some horses are not lame upon physicalexamination but have radiographic evidence of thirdphalanx rotation or distal displacement. Laminitisoften rst develops after the horse has been grazingon pasture grass that is rich in nonstructural carbo-hydrates. This happens at times of the year whengrass is abundant and growing rapidly or when re-sponding to cooler temperatures in the fall. Own-ers of horses with recurrent laminitis also reportthat laminitis episodes occur after changes in seasonor with the onset of cold weather. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 9IN-DEPTH: LAMINITISAssessment of Insulin and Glucose Dynamics Specic blood screening and dynamic tests based onglucose and insulin concentrations must be per-formed for an accurate diagnosis of IR. Screeningtests include fasting glucose and insulin concentra-tions. However, it is now recognized that manyaffected animals that exhibit abnormally highinsulin responses to dynamic challenge tests (seebelow) have normal resting-insulin concentra- tions. 25Horses should feedstuffs rich in nonstructural carbohydrates within 6-8hours of testing to accurately interpret the results 26 (although there is debate currently about the properdietary preparation for testing). 27One suggested method for preparation recommends that the horseis fed one flake of hay overnight (after 10:00 pm),with blood collected in the morning (ideally between7:00 and 10:00 am). Blood samples must be refrig-erated and sent for analysis to a reputable labora-tory running an assay validated for horses for analysis. Horses are considered to have IR if fast-ing glucose concentrations /H11022110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) and insulin concentrations /H1102220 /H9262IU/mL. In one study from our group, evaluation of basal seruminsulin concentration was normal ( /H1102120 glucose tolerancetest (FSIGTT) with Minimal Model analysis, sevenof these horses were actually IR. 25Based on these results, basal insulin concentration, although spe-cic, has insufcient sensitivity to be used as a sin-gle screening test for IR in equids. It should also benoted that within an individual animal, there can bemarked inter-day variation in serum insulin concen-trations; this is another major limitation in the useof resting insulin for diagnosis of IR. Proxy estimates of insulin sensitivity from single measurements of glucose and insulin have been used for diagnosis of IR. 28Commonly used proxies have included the glucose-to-insulin ratio, the recip-rocal of the square root of insulin (insulin-0.5), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index(1/(log[insulin] /H11001log[glucose])), and the modied in- sulin-to-glucose ratio (800 - 0.3 /H11003[insulin - 50])2/ [glucose - 30]; this test is an estimate of pancreatic /H9252-cell responsiveness). These proxy measure- ments have been suggested to be useful for distin-guishing groups of laminitis-prone and controlponies, but they did not accurately predict predis-position to laminitis in individual ponies. 29Sea- sonal variation in the proxy measurements ofinsulin sensitivity also have been observed, con-founding interpretation. When results of resting basal insulin concentra- tions are inconsistent or when insulin is /H1102120 /H9262IU/mL in the face of other clinical or historical ndings indicative of EMS, dynamic evaluation ofinsulin sensitivity and/or glucose tolerance is recom-mended. These tests are also useful to assess se-verity of IR, to monitor disease progression, andto evaluate response to treatment. Dynamic testsinclude the intravenous glucose tolerance test(IVGTT), the combined glucose-insulin test (CGIT),and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)/OST,among others. Methods for quantitative assess-ment of insulin sensitivity such as the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and Minimal Model analy-sis of a FSIGTT provide valuable information in theresearch setting, but these tests are impractical forclinical use. The IVGTT has historically been one of the most frequently used methods for assessment of glucosetolerance in the horse. It requires dextrose admin-istration and sequential blood sampling to measureblood glucose concentrations, which can be done atthe stall side/on-farm using a handheld glucometer.Horses should be held off feed for 6-8 hours prior totesting. Dextrose (150-300 mg/kg body weight[BW]; 50% solution) is administered IV after collec- tion of a baseline blood sample. Additional bloodsamples are collected every 30 minutes for 180minutes. In insulin-sensitive horses, glucose con- centrations should be back to baseline values by 150 minutes post-dextrose administration. Horses withelevated glucose at 180 minutes are likely to have IR.This test can be simplied for eld use by collectingsamples at 0, 150, and 180 minutes. The goal with the CGIT is to assess insulin sensi- tivity by determining the time when glucose concen-trations return to baseline values after the combinedIV administration of dextrose and insulin as bo-luses. An IV catheter is placed the day before orjust prior to testing. The horse is fasted or offeredone flake of hay overnight. After collection of abaseline blood sample, dextrose (150 mg/kg BW IV;50% solution) is administered and immediately fol-lowed by injection of regular human insulin (0.1IU/kg BW, IV). Blood samples are collected at 0, 1,5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, and 150minutes post-administration to measure glucoseconcentrations. Insulin concentration can bemeasured in a sample collected 45 minutes post-administration. A horse is considered to have IR ifthe blood glucose concentration is above baseline orinsulin concentration is /H11022100 /H9262IU/mL at 45 minutes post-administration. This test can be performed inthe eld, and glucose concentrations can be mea-sured with a handheld glucometer. It is importantto keep in mind when performing the CGIT thathypoglycemia can be a potential complication, andhaving dextrose readily available for rescue pur-poses is highly recommended. A more practicaland economical modication of this test protocol isto collect a baseline blood sample, administer dex-trose immediately followed by insulin, and mea-sure glucose and insulin concentrations at 45minutes post-drug administration. Interpreta-tion is as previously described. A modied approach to the OGTT, the OST, has recently been recommended as the preferred methodfor dynamic assessment of glucose and insulin dy- 10 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMINITISnamics in horses in clinical settings. This test in-volves the oral administration of corn syrup (KaroLight at a dosage of 15 mL per 100 kg body weight,equivalent to 150 mg sugar/kg BW) after a shortperiod (8-10 hours) of feed withholding. A bloodsample is collected at 60 and 90 minutes after sugaradministration for measurement of glucose and insulin concentrations. An insulin concentration/H1102260 /H9262IU/mL at either time point suggests abnormal hyperinsulinemia. An excessive glucose responseis indicated by a glucose concentration /H11022125 mg/dL (/H110226.9 mmol/L) at 60 or 90 minutes. An \"in-feedOGTT\" has also been used to assess glucose andinsulin responses in EMS suspects, particularly inareas where corn syrup is difcult to obtain. 30 For this test, the animal is provided a small mealcomposed of dextrose powder (1 g/kg bodyweight)mixed with a small amount ( /H110111 lb or 450 g) of a low-glycemic feedstuff, such as hay chaff. A bloodsample for measurement of insulin concentration iscollected 2 hours after feeding; values at /H1102285 /H9262IU/mL are considered to be abnormal. For both the OST and in-feed OGTT, owners may be con-cerned about adverse effects associated with the ad-ministration of sugar/glucose to insulin-resistantanimals (e.g., laminitis), but the risk seems to bevery small based upon the author's experience.In addition, investigators who have administeredhundreds of OSTs to horses and ponies for epidemi-ologic and genetic studies of EMS have reported nonew laminitic episodes immediately post-testing;the risk seems to be quite low.

Introduction Laminitis is a relatively common consequence of dis-eases characterized by the systemic inflammatory re-sponse syndrome, particularly if this inflammation istriggered by bacterial infection or bacterial products including endotoxin (\"sepsis\"). Although the presenceof clinical signs (tachycardia, fever, hyperemic mucusmembranes) and clinical laboratory evidence (neutrope-nia and toxic neutrophils) of sepsis/endotoxemia have long been recognized as a risk factor for the develop-ment of laminitis, it was only recently that this rela-tionship was conrmed in a clinical retrospectivestudy. 1Success in treating horses with diseases such as colitis, metritis, and pneumonia is still limited byour ability to prevent acute laminitis: if laminitis de- velops in these cases, it often involves rapid progressionof the lesion and mechanical failure of the lamellae, witheuthanasia or long-term debilitation due to chronic lami-nitis being common outcomes. Advances in the way wemanage these primary diseases and concurrent sepsis, aswell as the incorporation of specic preventative strate-gies for laminitis, are leading to improved outcomes forhorses with acute septic disease. 2. Pathophysiology of Sepsis-Related Laminitis Sepsis is differentiated from simple infection by thepresence of an aberrant or dysregulated host re-sponse (inflammatory, coagulopathic, and metabolicderangements) and organ dysfunction. 2In most species including humans, the development of end-organ dysfunction/failure (\"multiple organ dysfunc-tion syndrome\" [MODS]), most commonly affectingthe lungs, liver, and kidneys, has a major effect onsurvival in cases of sepsis. Laminitis seems to be aform of end-organ dysfunction/failure that is ulti-mately most important in terms of recovery for the adult horse with sepsis. The pathophysiology of or-gan dysfunction in sepsis (and sepsis-associated lami-nitis) is still poorly understood. Efforts to determinethe mechanisms that lead to sepsis-associated lami-nitis have mirrored those in human MODS research, with the investigation of circulatory derangements,local inflammatory processes, apoptosis, and nonisch-emic derangement of cellular energy metabolism receiving the most attention. Although there issome evidence of microvascular dysfunction inMODS and laminitis, there is no evidence of trueischemia. The central role of inflammation in thepathogenesis of acute laminitis has been highlightedexperimentally, with endothelial and and leukocyteemigration into the lamellar tissue occurring earlyduring the development of experimentally inducedlaminitis. There is little evidence that apoptosis or AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 13IN-DEPTH: LAMINITIS NOTESoxidative play a primary role in laminitisdevelopment. Since the lamellae have a unique mechanical role, the lamellar basal epithelial celladhesions and the integrity of the extracellular matrix have received special research attention.Recent evidence suggests that enzymatic degrada- tion of extracellular matrix components by e.g., matrixmetalloproteinase enzymes seem to play only a sec-ondary role. There is evidence of nonischemic energyfailure (mitochondrial dysfunction) in models of hu- man sepsis that is thought to play a role in MODS. 3 This process may represent a down-regulation ofcellular metabolic pathways that is actually protec-tive in tissues during sepsis and new evidence sug-gests that mitochondrial responses to sepsis aretissue specic. 4Similar disruption of energy me - tabolism in sepsis-induced laminitis has not beendocumented in studies thus far 5; however, if pres - ent, this could interfere with the maintenance ofcellular adhesions and contribute to this lesion.Although insulin dysregulation may be a feature ofsepsis in horses, it is clear from experimental sepsis-related laminitis models using carbohydrate over-load 6-8that laminitis develops in the absence of clinically signicant hyperinsulinemia. Unfortu-nately, the pathway from the systemic inflamma-tion of sepsis in horses to lamellar structuralfailure remains unclear. 3. Strategies for Prevention of Sepsis-RelatedLaminitis Once established, laminitis causes derangements ofthe lamellar structure that are largely irreversible;therefore, efforts should be aimed at prevention andthis begins with identication of the at-risk horse.Conditions associated with a high risk laminitisdevelopment include enteritis, complicatedgastrointestinal obstructions, metritis, pneumonia,and alimentary carbohydrate overload. 1,9-13Ther - apeutic efforts to control the primary disease andthe systemic inflammation in cases of equine sepsisare paramount. Intravenous fluids for circulatorysupport, binding of circulating endotoxin using poly-mixin B and hyperimmune plasma, and the use ofNSAIDs to control downstream inflammation arereasonable treatment strategies, particularly incases of gut-derived sepsis. 13Although one study seemed to identify a possible protective effect oflow-molecular-weight heparin in surgical colic cases,the control group was historical and the evidenceweak. 14Treatment with unfractionated heparin failed to have an effect on the development of sepsis-related laminitis induced experimentally with car-bohydrate overload. 15 4. Digital Hypothermia (Cryotherapy) The protective effect of prophylactic continuous cool-ing of the feet has been demonstrated in severalexperimental studies 16-19and it remains the only therapy to repeatedly withstand scientic rigor.Supporting its clinical application, a recent retro-spective study of hospitalized equine colitis casesshowed that survival was 98% in horses that did notdevelop laminitis, compared with only 48% in thosethat did, and that horses treated with digital hypo-thermia were 10 times less likely to develop lamin-itis. 20There are several potential mechanisms by which hypothermia might protect against sepsis-related laminitis. When applied before the onset ofclinical lameness in an experimental model, contin-uous digital 17In hibitory effect on lamellar-matrix metalloproteinaseexpression, 19a nding consistent with experimental of hypothermia in brain trauma21and car - diac arrest.22Interestingly, despite a marked ther - apeutic effect in preventing lesion progression whenapplied after the onset of lameness in an experimen-tal laminitis model, inhibition of inflammation didnot seem to be a therapeutic mechanism based onthe lack of a detectable effect on inflammatorymediator expression. 23In other animal models of sepsis, preservation of cellular energy metabolismand mitochondrial function, 24,25reduced of hypothermia that protect against end- organ damage in the liver, lung, and heart. Thecontribution of cellular energy failure (nonischemic)to the different forms of laminitis is unclear, 5but hypothermia of the equine digit may exert protectiveeffects on lamellar tissue by modulating mitochon-drial function and reducing metabolic demands. Any horse that is at immediate risk of developing acute laminitis is an appropriate candidate for theapplication of continuous distal-limb hypothermia.Although prophylactic application is ideal, there is experimental evidence supporting digital hypothermiaapplication in horses with acute sepsis-related lamin-itis (i.e., with pre-existing lameness). 18There is cur - rently no scientic evidence to guide the duration oftherapeutic hypothermia nor the temperature spe-cically in the clinical setting; however, continuouscooling of all four feet until after the abatement ofclinical signs/clinical laboratory evidence of sepsis isgenerally recommended, which may be several daysin some cases. Based on experimental data, digitalhypothermia should be aimed at achieving hoof wallsurface temperatures that are (at least) consistentlybelow 10\u00b0C, and it seems that cooling from the mid-cannon region distally (including the hoof and sole)is required to effectively cool incoming arterial bloodas well as prevent heat transfer from the environ-ment to the lamellae via the hoof itself. A waterinterface against the limb overcomes the conductionbarrier of the hair coat and negates the difculty ingetting consistent contact of a heat exchanger withthe uneven surface of the equine distal limb. of the metacarpus/metatarsus distally in an ice-and-water mixtureeffectively achieves this, re- 14 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMINITISplenishment is labor intensive. A practical and ef-fective solution particularly for eld application isstill lacking. There are anecdotal reports of complications in horses being treated with digital hypothermia:dermatitis of the pastern and maceration of the cor-onary band can occur particularly when cooling formore than 5 days, but in most cases this resolveswith no or minimal treatment once the cooling isceased. On rare occasions, more extensive and se-vere necrosis of supercial distal limb tissue that isconsistent with true frostbite is reported\u2014thisseems to be more commonly associated with theapplication of ice typically directly from a freezer(between /H1100220\u00b0C and /H1100230\u00b0C) directly to the limb without a water interface, which should be avoided. 5. Treatment of the Acute Case There is experimental evidence that the applicationof digital hypothermia during the acute phase ofsepsis-related laminitis (after lameness develops)can help to limit progression. 18Although there is no evidence to guide the duration of therapeuticcooling in acute laminitis cases, the therapeutic ef-fect is likely to diminish past seven days after theonset of lameness, particularly if the sepsis has re-solved. The analgesic effects of digital hypother-mia can also be useful in acute cases in conjunctionwith traditional pharmacological analgesia (includ-ing NSAIDs). Restricting ambulation is paramount in the early stages of acute laminitis regardless of the cause.Horses should be conned to a stall and encouragedto lie down by providing deep comfortable bedding.Tranquilizers and sedatives may encourage recum-bency and reduce voluntary weight bearing andambulation in horses with acute laminitis. Provid-ing support to the caudal sole and frog using eitherorthotic support material attached to the feet (sili-cone impression material, foam, or similar) and/orbedding material that conforms to the foot andyields both under the toe to minimize break over and also while pivoting (ideally sand) can help toreduce mechanical distractive forces on the lamel- lae and often rapidly improves lameness in acutecases. Careful serial radiographic assessment isessential to track progress in the early stages ofacute laminitis.

Consequently, nu-tritional, exercise, and (if necessary) pharmacologicinterventions are mainstays of clinical patient man-agement. This paper describes some strategies andguidelines that can be used by veterinarians whendevising nutrition and medication plans for endocri-nopathic laminitis patients. 2. Nutritional Management Nutritional management of equine metabolic syn-drome (EMS) and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) con-tent of all feedstuffs provided to the animal, 2)restricting pasture access until ID has been shownto improve via follow up laboratory assessments(with cautious and gradual re-introduction to pas-ture after that point), and 3) caloric restriction toencourage weight loss if a reduction in body condi-tion is indicated. The rst approach involves selec-tion of forage with a low sugar/starch/fructan NSC)content, which can be determined by submitting aforage sample for nutritional analysis. Taking sev-eral samples of several bales in a purchased lot ofhay is recommended, given that single samples canbe misleading; use of a hay core sampler is recom-mended. The NSC content of tested forage can becalculated by adding the measured starch and eth- anol-soluble carbohydrate fractions together, andthis number should ideally fall below 10% on a dry-matter basis as-fed (in all dietary components, notjust the forage). The amount of NSC intake thatcan be tolerated by an individual EMS patient de-pends on their degree of ID. Horses with severe ID(resting insulin concentration /H1102275-100 /H9262IU/mL, abnormal oral sugar test, or combined glucose/insu- lin test results, actively laminitic) should be main- tained on a strict diet with a NSC content /H1102110%, whereas mildly affected animals or animals that areimproving with treatment can likely be fed hay withhigher NSC content (gradually introduced). If hayhas an NSC level /H1102210% and must be used (i.e., the client has already purchased a signicant amount ofit), soaking the hay in cold water for 3-6 hours priorto feeding should lower the sugar content by 1 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 17IN-DEPTH: LAMINITIS NOTESSoaked hay should be fed and consumed promptly,given that it can support mold growth readily; thesoaking liquid should be discarded in a place wherethe horse cannot access it, given that it can be verypalatable to some horses. Lean horses with insulin resistance (IR)/ID (such as an animal genetically at risk for EMS that hasnever been allowed to become overweight, or anEMS patient that has lost weight but remains IR)can be challenging to feed, given that they oftenrequire more calories, which must be offered in away that does not exacerbate ID. This can be ac-complished by feeding one of the low-sugar/low-starch (low-NSC) pelleted feeds that are currentlycommercially available, although determining theproduct's NSC content is recommended prior to feed-ing (this information will not be included on the feedtag). These feeds vary in their NSC content, so theseverity of ID must be taken into account before oneis selected. It is also better to divide the daily ra-tion into multiple small meals and to feed hay be-forehand to slow rate of consumption and gastricemptying. These strategies are employed to lowerthe glycemic response to a meal, which is the degreeto which blood glucose concentrations (and conse-quently, blood insulin concentrations) increase inresponse to feeding. Individual horses may re-spond differently to the same product, so it is advis-able to recheck glucose and insulin concentrations7-14 days after introducing a new diet. Horseswith severe ID can be particularly difcult to man-age and may require a more individualized approachto diet formulation; getting an equine nutritionistinvolved in the case can be very helpful. Molasses-free beet pulp can be fed as a more economical al-ternative to commercial feeds. This is a feedstuffwith a low glycemic index and provides caloriesthrough hindgut fermentation and volatile fatty acidproduction. Fat and ber are safer sources of calo-ries than NSC for horses with ID that need to main-tain or gain weight. 2 Weight loss should be encouraged in overweight or obese horses by decreasing the total number of dailycalories consumed. In horses that are overweightand being overfed (which is often the case), remov-ing all concentrate feed(s) from the diet is often asufcient change to allow the horse to achieve itsideal body weight within 8-12 weeks. Total caloricintake should initially be met by feeding hay (ideallya grass hay tested and determined /H1102110% NSC) in amounts equivalent to 1.5-2.0% of current body weight. If the horse does not lose weight as ex-pected over 6-8 weeks, the amount fed should begradually decreased over several weeks to 1.0-1.5%ofideal body weight; feeding less than 1.0% of ideal body weight in forage per day is not recommended,given that this may represent a risk for hyperlipid-emia/hyperlipemia in overweight equids with ID. These strategies are effective for horses kept in stalls or dirt lots, but weight loss is more difcult toachieve when horses have access to pasture (giventhat this represents a dietary component whose con-sumption is difcult to quantify or control effec-tively). Strategies for limiting grass consumptionon pasture include restricted (30-60 minutes) turn-out periods; connement to a small paddock, roundpen, or area enclosed with electric tape/braid fence;or use of a grazing muzzle. Appropriate vitaminand mineral supplements should be provided tohorses conned to dirt paddocks or stalls or whosedaily forage ration consists of a restricted amount ofgrass hay; protein (30-35%) and trace mineral/vita-min products are commercially available a,b, and in the author's experience, 0.5-1.5 lb per day of one ofthese products is typically sufcient for a 450-500kg animal whose diet is otherwise grass hay only(label recommendations should be consulted beforeuse of an individual product). Pasture access mustremain restricted until insulin sensitivity has im-proved (ideally as documented with follow up labo-ratory testing), given that carbohydrates consumedon pasture can trigger recurrent bouts of laminitisin susceptible horses. Pasture is also an unregu-lated source of starch, sugars, and fructans, so thesecarbohydrates can continue to exacerbate ID, evenwhen other aspects of the diet have been controlled. Horses with recurrent laminitis may require housing away from pasture indenitely. These an-imals should be housed in dirt lots so that they areable to move freely and exercise once laminitic painhas been controlled. Mildly affected horses can bereturned to pasture if ID can be managed, but cau-tion should be exercised when grass is going throughdynamic phases, such as rapid growth in the springor senescence in the fall. Based on the diurnalvariability of NSC content in pasture grass, earlymorning grazing (i.e., before sunlight becomes in-tense) is likely the safest time to offer limited peri-ods of grazing for horses with ID. 3 3. Pharmacotherapeutics for EMS The majority of EMS patients can be effectivelymanaged by lowering the NSC content of the diet,reducing body weight if the animal is overweight orobese, instituting a regular exercise program, andcontrolling access to pasture. In fact, there is re-cent published evidence of the effectiveness of dietand exercise programs that are tailored to the indi-vidual horse or pony in improving insulin and glucose dynamics and enhancing weight loss. 4How - ever, it takes time for these management changes totake effect, so pharmacological interventions can beconsidered to accelerate progress if the patient hasrecurrent or intractable bouts of laminitis (particu-larly as it restricts their ability to perform regularexercise). Levothyroxine sodium can be adminis-tered to accelerate weight loss and improve insulinsensitivity in obese horses but should be avoided inlean EMS patients because of the reduction in bodyweight that may accompany its use. Metforminmay also be useful; this drug may improve insulin 18 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: LAMINITISsensitivity in ID withoutaffecting body weight signicantly. Levothyroxine Sodium Insulin and glucose dynamics can be improved andweight loss can be encouraged in overweight/obeseEMS patients when levothyroxine sodium is admin-istered orally at a dosage of 48 mg (total per 500-kghorse)/day for 3-6 months. 5Smaller equids (po - nies, American Miniature Horses) can be given 24mg levothyroxine sodium per day for the same timeperiod. Levothyroxine sodium cis one available product that has been used extensively in the treat-ment of horses with EMS; one scoop of powder pro-vides 12 mg levothyroxine sodium, so 4 tsp should beadministered in the feed or by mouth once daily fora light breed horse receiving treatment. Otherproducts are available on the market and may beequally suitable for this use; most of the author'sclinical experience has been with levothyroxine so-dium c. When levothyroxine treatment is discontin - ued, horses should be weaned off the drug by halvingthe dose for 2 weeks, and then halving it again for 2more weeks. The risks and benets of treatinghorses with levothyroxine at lower dosages for lon-ger periods have not been evaluated, but conven-tional doses for 9-12 months do not seem to inducesignicant deleterious cardiovascular effects. 6 Measured serum total thyroxine tions considerablywithin and between horses. Serum concentra-tions often range between 40 and 100 ng/mL intreated horses, indicating that levothyroxine sodiumis being given at supraphysiological doses. How-ever, clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such assweating or tachycardia, have not been reported intreated horses. Horses undergoing treatment withlevothyroxine should receive some degree of dietaryrestriction, given that this medication has been sub-jectively observed to increase feed intake duringtreatment. Weight loss is unlikely to efciently oc-cur if the horse is given ad libitum access to feed-stuffs (particularly pasture). Metformin biguanide medication that has been usedextensively as an antihyperglycemic and insulin-sensitizing drug in the clinical management of hu-man metabolic syndrome and type II diabetesmellitus. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacody-namics of this drug have been well characterized inhumans (in fact, it is one of the most heavily pre-scribed medications in the United States); however,whereas metformin has been used empirically totreat equids afflicted while the effects of metformin on insulinsensitivity were assessed in horses and ponies withID, a positive response was detected initially with-out the development of hypoglycemia; however,long-term results were variable (metformin was alsonot the only treatment provided for the animals inthis study). 7Metformin was administered at a dos - age of 15 mg/kg orally twice daily in the aforemen-tioned study, but the pharmacokinetics of this drughas been subsequently examined, and results sug-gest that the drug has poor oral bioavailability inhorses and should likely be given at an increaseddose when compared with that recommended forhuman use (30 mg/kg instead of 15 mg/kg) q 8-12 hbefore a meal. recent work suggests that metformin may attenuate postprandial hyperglyce-mia when given prior to administration of an enteralcarbohydrate challenge in horses 9; the drug may therefore have some utility in mitigating the risk ofpasture in EMS-affected horses after dose and fre-quency recommendations have been optimized.Additional studies are required to assess the safetyand efcacy of this treatment for EMS, but the drugcould potentially affect several attractive therapeu-tic targets in this condition. In fact, metformin hasbeen shown to enhance polarity and adhesivenessof epithelial cells in other species and experimen-tal systems, and evaluation of the drug for use inthe prevention of endocrinopathic laminitis basedon this characteristic, as well as its effects oninsulin and glucose dynamics, is certainly war-ranted. AMPK activity within the digital lami-nae of ponies subjected to high-carbohydratefeeding has been shown to be decreased 10,s oi ti s possible that administration of an AMPK agonistlike metformin in this setting may be helpful.No adverse effects of metformin administrationhave been reported in treated equids to date, butthese may not be apparent until use of the drug ismore widespread in this species. Metabolic aci-dosis (sometimes severe and life threatening) hasbeen reported in people treated with metformin,and the risk of this complication seems to be in-creased in patients with underlying renal disease;while this has not been reported in horses to date,assessing bloodwork with attention to renal val-ues in equine patients prior to initiating therapywith metformin may be warranted. Numerous other treatments have been sug- gested for the management of ID in horses, includ-ing as etc. thesetherapies may be of some benet (particularly incombination), but additional studies are requiredto establish their efcacy. Preliminary work sug-gests that at least one commercially available nu-tritional supplement had no detectable effect onthe degree of ID in treated horses. 14 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 19IN-DEPTH: LAMINITIS4. of with of medication to suppress secretory activity ofthe pars intermedia and management changes, 15 and a labeled, US Food and Drug Administration-approved preparation of the dopaminergic agonistpergolide mesylate dis available and recommended as the rst-line treatment of PPID. Most horses receivea starting pergolide dose of 1 mg/day, but initiatingtreatment at 0.5 mg/day may be helpful for mitigatinginappetance and loose manure that can accompanythe rst few days of treatment. The dose can be in-creased to 1 mg/day after 2-3 weeks. Monitoringplasma adrenocorticotropic hormone concen-trations in response to therapy (4-6 weeks after adose alteration) can be helpful for optimization of dos-ing, and cyproheptadine (0.3 mg/kg PO q 12 h) can beadded as an adjunctive therapy in horses whose clini-cal signs persist despite pergolide dose escalation (or ifpergolide dose escalation becomes nancially unten-able). Empiric pergolide treatment of withnewly diagnosed laminitis of unclear etiology is a com-mon practice, particularly if the horse is geriatric.Nutritional management strategies employed forhorses with EMS (i.e., those indicated for managementof ID/IR) are also often appropriate for horses withPPID; In addition, geriatric horses with PPID withpoor dentition may require further dietary modica-tion to address this concern (chopped or pelleted for-ages or complete feeds may need to be the primarysource of calories if they cannot masticate hayproperly).

Introduction Despite signicant recent advances in our ability totreat complicated fractures and other painful limbconditions in horses, supporting-limb laminitis(SLL) remains a primary limiting factor to treat- ment success in these cases. Although the severityand duration of lameness are considered risk fac-tors, the development of SLL is still unpredictable,both in terms of timing and also with respect towhich cases will succumb to it (and what degree ofpain in the limb with the primary condition is nec-essary for SLL development). This form of lamini-tis tends to be commonly associated with rapid andsevere failure of the lamellae, with subsequent dis-tal displacement (\"sinking\") of the distal phalanxwithin the hoof capsule. The incidence has beenestimated at approximately 10% to 15% of horsesthat present for painful limb problems (or requirelimb casts) in North American studies 1-4; however, the threat of SLL contributes to a reduced propen-sity to even attempt treatment in many complicatedpainful limb conditions (particularly complicatedfractures), with many of these horses instead beingeuthanized. 2. Pathophysiology Mechanical and vascular mechanisms have been considered by authors as potential contributors tothe pathophysiology of SLL, but there is very littlepublished evidence. 2,5It is well accepted that, in the standing horse, the body mass is divided be-tween the fore and hind limbs in a 60:40 ratio. 6 With peak ground reaction forces increasing to beequivalent to 0.25 times body weight (bwt) at thewalk, 0.5 times bwt at the trot, and up to 3 times bwtat the gallop, it seems unlikely from a mechanicalperspective that compensatory load redistribution inthe standing horse bearing weight on a single limbcould exceed the mechanical tensile strength of thelamellae. However, the ability of consistent increasesin load to trigger lamellar epidermal remodellingcannot be discounted, and evidence that lamellarremodelling may occur in response to stress 7-9has important implications for the pathophysiology ofSLL. The lamellar tissue has a high requirementfor glucose, presumably for maintaining the integ-rity of cellular attachments, yet there is no meansfor local glycogen storage. Therefore, reduced (orinadequate) supply of blood glucose may rapidly leadto energy failure. Almost 30 years ago, it was rstdemonstrated that there was a valve-like mecha-nism in the digital arteries of the loaded limb leading to a cut-off of arterial blood supply during the loading phase. 10,11This work has been repeated recently by the author's group using three-dimensionalcomputed tomography studies, demonstrating ar-terial attenuation and occlusion under load in ca-daver limbs that affects contrast ll in the arterial AAEP utilizing microdialysis, (a technique that allows real-time detection of local energy metabolites andblood flow in the lamellar interstitium) showed that lamellar perfusion and energy balance are largelydetermined by the frequency of limb-load cycling(weight-shifting frequency), which seems to overrideother manipulations such as attempts to modulatevasomotor tone pharmacologically. 12,13These stud - ies showed that the act of walking had a marked positive effect on lamellar perfusion and interstitialglucose concentrations, moreso than just repeatedunloading of the limb in a static/standing horse,indicating that the weight-bearing phase itself (andperhaps the movement of the limb associated withbreak over) may play an important role in lamellarperfusion. The potential mechanisms that mightimpair lamellar microvascular perfusion in the sup-porting limb of a clinical patient are likely to bemore complicated than simple arterial occlusion alone, with postcapillary venous and interstitialpressure within the digit also likely to be affected byincreased load and reduced load cycling on the sup-porting limb. The contribution of systemic inflam-mation and endocrine dysregulation (implicated inother forms of laminitis) to the development of SLLis also unclear; however, many SLL cases in clinicalpractice are complicated by infection and presum-ably suffer at least transient periods of insulin dys-regulation during treatment for their primaryinjury 2although this has not yet been studied. 3. Prevention It seems that cyclic loading and unloading of the feetplays an essential role in digital homeostasis. In ahorse that is preferentially weight bearing on onelimb, it is currently not clear whether static or dy-namic manipulations of the supporting limb (usingorthotics or other devices) are sufcient to improvelamellar perfusion and energy balance without in-termittent complete of the limb; how-ever, studies specically evaluating this areunderway. The key to SLL prevention is likely tobe the development of strategies to monitor and thenregulate mean load and load-cycling frequency inthe supporting limb of patients at risk. Monitoringshould include some form of serial assessment oflimb-load cycling\u2014human pedometer devices andtness tracking devices that incorporate accelerom-eters can track limb load cycling over time and maybe of use clinically. In horses at risk, regular en-couragement to walk may be benecial; however,there is insufcient data to support specic recom-mendations at this stage and the logistics of thismay depend on the nature and severity of the pri-mary condition. Strategies to reduce weight on thesupporting limb may include partial and preferablydynamic sling support and periodic forced or encour-aged recumbency. Although sedation may help toencourage recumbency, it also reduces voluntary ex-ercise and limb load cycling in stabled patients andtherefore may be contraindicated. Effective anal-gesia to control pain in the primarily affected limbwill help to encourage more normal weight-bearingpatterns in the supporting limb. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and mul-timodal or regional analgesic techniques have beenreviewed in detail elsewhere. 14 Acknowledgments The Author is supported by funding from the Gray-son Jockey Club Research Foundation.Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri-nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

Introduction The complications that will primarily be covered inthis lecture are those dealing with injury and sepsisto the sole and subsolear tissue in the acute andchronic laminitis case. Whereas \"acute\" has beencommonly used to describe the laminitis case inwhich displacement of the distal phalanx is not de-tectable by radiographs, it is being used here as a temporal term indicating that the disease has onlybeen occurring for several days. Similarly, the term \"chronic\" is used by the author to describe the lami-nitis case in which foot pathology related to theoriginal laminitis event (or recurring events) hasbeen ongoing for several weeks to years. 2. The Acute Case The most common complications dealt with in lami-nitis cases are those related to excessive solear pres-sure due to a rapid displacement of the distalphalanx. The distally displacing distal phalanx notonly puts excessive pressure on the keratinized sole,but also disrupts the underlying dermis, which supply for the solear epitheliumand the innervation for the sole. In the severe,acute case of laminitis (most commonly either sepsisrelated or supporting limb laminitis), the distal pha-lanx may perforate the sole, most commonly imme-diately cranial to the apex of the frog. However, incases of asymmetrical distal displacement of thedistal phalanx (commonly termed \"medial sinking\"due to the fact that distal displacement of the medialaspect is much more common than the lateral as-pect), the sole overlying the displaced aspect of thedistal phalanx (commonly the medial sole) may beaffected between the frog and hoof wall. In theacute case of laminitis, in which a rapid descent ofthe distal phalanx has resulted in perforation of thesole, both the perforation itself and the immenselamellar instability that led to the perforation are ofgreat concern for treatment. The major concernsare attempting to neutralize the forces leading to theacute perforation, while also treating the injuredregion of the sole. A lateral and dorsopalmar ra-diograph are essential to assess the position of thedistal phalanx. Solear perforation at the toe mostcommonly occurs with some degree of capsular rota-tion (divergence of the dorsal surface of the distalphalanx from the hoof wall) of the distal phalanxevident on radiographs. If phalangeal (di-vergence of surface of the distal phalanxfrom the normal phalangeal axis resulting in flexionof interphalangeal joint) is also present,deep digital flexor tenotomy is commonly performed(more commonly in chronic cases) to decrease thetension the deep flexor tendon applies distal However,even in the case of capsular rotation with minimalphalangeal rotation, deep digital flexor tenotomyanecdotally helps some horses. Inferior check liga-ment desmotomy has been described as an alterna-tive to deep digital flexor tenotomy both anecdotallyand in case reports, but, to the author's knowledge,no in-depth study has been published on its efcacyfor treatment of laminitis. Although many veteri-narians maintain the foot in temporary shoes a(e.g., wooden shoe applied with screws and/or cast tape) inthese cases, due to the marked instability of thelamellae in many of these acute cases, it is possiblethat therapeutic shoeing may not provide enoughprotection from the forces to which this weakenedtissue is exposed. Both open sole half limb casts(Fig. 1) and foot casts have been applied in attemptto neutralize as much of the downward force aspossible. 13. The Chronic Case Solear disease is a common complication in the an-imal with chronic laminitis also, and in the author'sexperience, is the most common cause of foot pain(vs laminar pain) in the long-term case of laminitis.It is not uncommon for the lamellae to be stable inthe chronic case, but for constant injury to the soleand dorsodistal aspect of the distal phalanx to becausing pain due to both an abnormal orientationof the distal phalanx and the commonly thinned/compressed sole. With regard to solear disease inthe intact sole (i.e., not perforated), the injury canrange from subsolear bruising to seroma and/or ab-scess formation. The most common abnormalities associated with the distal phalanx (DP) in the chronic cases is anaseptic pedal osteitis, where the solear margin of thedisplaced aspect of the DP (most commonly the toeregion), seems severely mottled (Fig. 2B) due to con-stant bruising and inflammation. Given that thesebony changes are commonly present in the chroniccase with subsolear abscess formation, the clinicianneeds to determine whether there is actually a sep-tic pedal osteitis present before considering curet-ting the DP. For septic osteitis to be present, afocal region of severe bony lysis should be identi-able on radiographs (Fig. 3A). If is only ageneral \"moth-eaten\" appearance to the solear mar-gin of the DP (Fig. 2), it is advisable to not curettethe DP and concentrate on treating the subsolearsepsis. When assessing the solear region, it can be difcult with an intact sole to determine whether there is anunderlying seroma or abscess. It is lateral, dorsopal-mar [0 degree], and 60 degree dorsopalmar/solearmargin) before exploring the sole to 1) determine theposition of the distal phalanx (i.e., is it immediately Fig. 1. Open sole cast application for acute perforation of thesole to improve weight bearing (A). Note that the foot impres-sion material can be placed in unaffected sole and frog for supportwhile affected regions can be left exposed for assessment andtreatment (B). Fig. 2. A horse presented with a 7-day history of severe bilateral forelimb lameness with draining tracts on the solear surfaces of bothfeet. Radiographic measurements indicated a chronic distal displacement of the distal phalanx, and a focal lucency in the soleartissue immediately distal to the dorsodistal aspect of the distal phalanx (A, arrows in main image and magnied inset). Due to thesomewhat diffuse nature to the bone resorption on the solear margin (B, arrows in main image, magnied inset), the bone was notcuretted (deemed to most likely be aseptic resorption/\"osteitis\") and the feet treated only with soaks in a commercial chlorine solutionuntil dry (C, arrow), at which time the /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: 2) assess for existing ab- scesses, and 3) assess the health of the margin of thedistal phalanx. On radiographs, the abscess cavityusually cannot be visualized until drained (the pu-rulent material is a similar density as tissue). Ifabscesses have established drainage at some point(commonly through \"graveling out\"/exiting at thecoronary band), gas can commonly be observed onradiographs (white arrows in insets in Figs. 2A and3A [right inset], and white arrows in Fig. 4A). The primary goal of the author in cases of absces- sation is to not only remove all offending debris andorganisms, but to remove all moisture from the af-fected area (i.e., result in a \"dry\" lesion). It is com-mon in chronic laminitis cases to have an extensivearea of the sole affected by an abscess (Fig. 4A).In these cases, it is unlikely that immersion of thefoot (i.e., in Epsom salts) will satisfactorily reach allareas in these cases or will result in removal of allmoisture from the affected area. In the author'sopinion, it is important to establish multiple smallopenings to allow both drainage and active lavage ofthe abscess. If there is a thinned area which, uponpalpation, is suspected of containing fluid (i.e., ei-ther seroma or abscess), the author will make asmall entry (approximately 3-4 mm), assess anyexudate, and probe the affected area to determinethe size of seroma or abscess (a nerve block may benecessary to provide analgesia for probing the re-gion). Another similar-sized opening can be madeat a distant margin of the undermined pocket, and asyringe tip, catheter, or teat cannula inserted toflush with saturated Epsom salts (300-400 mL)once to twice a day. If there is a large underminedarea affected by an abscess which is apparent onradiographs (Fig. 4A) but the sole is still intact, theabscess can be accessed through the hoof wall (Fig.4, B and C). The advantages of accessing throughthe hoof wall are 1) the ease in protecting the open-ings (i.e., with tape), 2) no pressure will be placed onthe region during weight bearing, and 3) extensiveshoeing (i.e., with a pad or treatment plate) are notnecessary to protect the area. With slightly largeropenings to the area, the additional soaking of theaffected foot/feet in commercial chlorine-relatedcompounds b, more commonly used for white line disease, can result in a rapid response. These com-pounds kill the offending organisms while also dry-ing out the affected areas (a critical aspect oftreating the affected foot), providing a much morerapid response than traditional foot soaks. Inmany chronic cases with subsolear abscessation inwhich a solear perforation is already present, theuse of soaks with a chlorine compound are com-monly all that is necessary. If the horse is severelylame on the one digit in the laminitis case, there isalways a concern that laminitis may recur in theopposite limb now bearing the majority of theweight. In these cases, an open sole cast (Fig. 1)can be used, allowing lavage of the affected areawhile usually improving the lameness due to thesupport the cast provides. In addition to approaching the subsolear injury directly, it is also important to address the abnor- Fig. 4. Note the presence of gas density throughout the sole be- tween the distal phalanx and ground surface of the sole (A, arrows)indicating an extensive (commonly termed \"underrun\") ab- scess. The abscess cavity was accessed through the hoof wall (B)to obtain a dorsal access/drainage point, leaving the sole in-tact. The abscess could then be flushed (C, white arrow) underpressure with saturated Epsom salts (C, fluid can be seen exitingan opening on the opposite hoof wall through which a sequestrumwas removed (black arrow). Fig. 3. A focal lucency noted on the dorsal aspect of the distalphalanx (A, arrow) in a chronic laminitis case with recurrentabscesses rupturing at the coronary band. Note the lack of thesame lucency on the opposite foot (A, left inset, arrow) indicatingthat this is not normal anatomy for this horse (i.e., a crena), andthe presence of gas lucency only at the toe (A, right inset, arrow)again indicating this region to be affected. The affected bonewas curetted in the standing horse through an existing defect inthe sole (B) under radiographic guidance (C). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 25IN-DEPTH: LAMINITISmalities in the digit that predisposed the sole toinjury. This will include therapeutic trimming andshoeing, and possibly surgical techniques such asdeep digital flexor tenotomy. These techniqueshave been recently covered at AAEP and will not becovered in detail in this presentation. In the horse in which subsolear abscessation re- curs in the same general region (either with solardrainage or rupturing/\"gravelling\" at the coronaryband) even with the above therapies, septic pedalosteitis should be suspected. In addition to a focallucency in the solar margin of the distal phalanx(Fig. 3), one or more bony fragments may be visiblewithin the lucency. Surgical debridement of theregion is required in these cases. Although easierto perform under general anesthesia, most cases canbe treated in the standing horse with local anesthe-sia. If the surgery is to be performed standing, theauthor commonly has the foot scrubbed then soakedin a commercial chlorine compound aimmediately prior to surgery. If there is a drainage tract in thefoot, either a curette or probe is placed in the tractand radiographs are taken to gauge the depth andangle at which the distal phalanx should be curet-ted. Similar to that described for subsolear ab-scesses, if the sole is intact, it is preferable toapproach the sequestrum through the hoof wall(Figs. 4, B and C). This is again a large advantagedue to ease of access for further therapy (eitherirrigation or application of antiseptic-soaked gauzesponge), and ease of protection (only tape needed vsa removeable shoe or treatment plate). The otheradvantage is extremely rapid healing. If a solear defect is present and needs to be pro- tected between treatments, the author prefers tap-ing on a temporary plastic shoe, most commonlyusing a commercial shoe aand, taking one of the wedges off the shoe (Fig. 5). For many veterinari-ans and owners, it is easier to remove (and reapply)the taped-on shoe daily than to work with the boltson a treatment plate.

The objectives of this paper are to provide anoverview of necessary equipment for the equinepractitioner to address upper airway conditions. 2. Materials and Methods Endoscopic equipment was researched and, whenpossible, utilized for diagnostics of the equine upperairway. 3. Results Flexible endoscopes are available in a variety oflengths, diameters, and congurations. The lengthof the scope will determine the specic regions thatcan be examined. Endoscopes of approximately1 m allow visualization of the upper airway, whereasa 3-m endoscope is typically necessary to view thelength of the equine esophagus and stomach. Priorto purchase of an endoscope, it is important to knowwhat areas you intend to examine and to know allnecessary parts of the equipment included in yourpurchase. The term endoscope can be used to de-scribe the entire system but often refers only to theflexible instrument that is inserted into the nasalpassage of the horse. Images can be viewedthrough an eyepiece or on a monitor, allowing mul-tiple users to view the display. Light delivery isnecessary to illuminate the visible structures andsurfaces of the airway. Image capture is a bene-cial part of the system because it aids when commu-nicating with horse owners and allows images tobecome a permanent part of the medical records.Working channels allow aspiration of samples, la-vage of surfaces, or delivery of medications. A de-vice to allow flushing of water or other liquids is alsoa benecial accessory, especially in horses with sig-nicant airway or gastric secretions. Endoscopicsystems can be divided into three main categories:portable, semi-portable, and tower systems. Thepower supply for portable systems is typically a bat-tery. Although this avoids the necessity of plugs and power cords, it does require periodic charging, batterymaintenance, and replacement. Although new unitsare nice, demo units or previous-generation equipmentcan be purchased at a lower cost and might be easier to justify when starting out or until a large-enoughclient base is established to demand regular use.Service contracts should be considered for the flexi-ble endoscope portion of your system, given that thisportion will undergo higher failure and accidentrates than the remainder of the system. Endoscopy AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 27HOW TO PERFORM ENDOSCOPY EQUINE PRACTICE NOTESsystems require cleaning and for some proceduressterilization between patients. Cleaning of theflexible scope, as well as all handles and dials, isimportant to prevent disease transmission betweenpatients. Endoscopy units should be pressurechecked prior to cleaning, to determine whether thechannel linings hold pressure and have not sus-tained penetrating damage that could allow liquidsand antiseptic fluids to leak into the sensitive innerregions of the equipment. This is especially impor-tant after utilizing the working channel for biopsy oraspiration, given that these events can predispose tochannel lining damage. 4. Discussion Practitioners looking to expand the diagnostic capa-bilities of their practice are likely to see a benetfrom purchase of an endoscope: a wonderful addi-tion to work up common problems. The respiratorytract, guttural pouches, oral cavity, esophagus, andstomach can all be viewed and evaluated with anendoscope. In addition, the equine stomach can beevaluated, making the diagnosis of gastric ulcer-ation a possibility, which at times is as easy aspassing a stomach tube, although understanding theanatomy of the stomach as well as how to manipu-late the endoscope is important to be able to visual-ize all portions of the stomach including the gastricoutflow tract and proximal duodenum. Gastros-copy is a very practical means to identify or rule outgastric ulceration and is used to grade ulcer severityand monitor treatment. Endoscopic equipment canbe sterilized and used to examine the urinary tractto evaluate horses for cystic or urethral calculi, masslesions, or infections. Respiratory endoscopy is primarily used to exam- ine horses that present for poor performance orhorses reported to have abnormal breathing sounds.Without sedation, the endoscope is passed up a nostriland the nasopharynx and larynx can be evaluated forresting function. Some horses with abnormal breath-ing might only show problems during exercise. Thesepatients could benet from endoscopy performed withthe horse exercising on a treadmill or perhaps using aportable system mounted on the horse or rider whilethe horse is being ridden or driven. This equipmentwill allow capture of images from lesions seen onlyduring a dynamic examination. For respiratory prob-lems beyond the larynx, the endoscope can be passedinto the trachea. Cytologic analysis of the deep air-ways can aid in an individualized treatment plan.

Additional diagnostics such as a dynamic ex-amination of the upper airway may be required toelucidate the problem(s) causing an abnormal respi-ratory noise and/or exercise intolerance. Evalua-tion of the upper airway during exercise allows theclinician to determine whether the horse has a dy-namic upper airway abnormality and then make themost accurate treatment recommendation. 2. History A complete and thorough history is a very importantpart of the upper airway evaluation. It is best toobtain this information from the individual(s) whoknow the horse best. Most often this is the traineror rider and may not be the owner of the horse.Specic questions regarding respiratory noise, exer-cise intolerance, coughing, nasal discharge, previoussurgery, and current or previous treatments shouldbe asked. Information regarding whether the noiseis made during inspiration or expiration is veryhelpful but oftentimes it is not accurate because theowner/trainer/rider has not listened for that specif-ically. Try to determine whether the abnormal noise occurs every time the horse works or if it isintermittent. In addition, ask questions to deter-mine at what point during exercise the horsemakes the noise. Another very important pieceof information, especially in horses that show \"col-lected\" or with poll flexion is: does the head po-sition of the horse affect respiratory noise? It canbe helpful to have the individual describe andcharacterize any abnormal respiratory noise(s)that the horse makes. It is important to deter-mine whether the horse is exercise intolerantand/or exhibiting poor performance. 3. Physical Examination Begin the physical examination with auscultation ofboth sides of the thoracic cavity. The heart rate,rhythm, and the presence of a cardiac murmur aredetermined. A rebreathing examination is impor-tant to evaluate the lungs. Remember that dis-ease(s) of the lower airways and lungs do not causeupper-respiratory noise. Visual assessment of thehead and nares should be performed to evaluate forasymmetry. Evaluate both nostrils for the pres-ence of airflow and determine whether it is equal. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 29HOW TO PERFORM ENDOSCOPY IN EQUINE PRACTICE NOTESEvaluation of the head and both eyes for the pres-ence of any cranial nerve decits should be per-formed. Each jugular vein should be evaluatedfor patency. Palpation of common surgical sitesshould be performed to check for scars. Palpationof a laryngoplasty scar can be difcult but clipping ofthe hair just ventral to the linguofacial vein can helpyou determine whether a scar is present. Palpationof the trachea should be performed to assess whether the horse has had previous trauma, malformed tra-cheal rings, or a tracheotomy performed in the past.Palpation of the larynx to assess for symmetry shouldalso be performed. This skill is not easy and requirespractice to become procient. Abnormalities such asa prominent muscular process as felt in cases of laryn-geal hemiplegia or the lack of a cricothyroid articula-tion as felt in cases of laryngeal dysplasia areimportant physical examination ndings. Histori-cally the slap test was used as another method toevaluate laryngeal adductor function. This test hasbeen shown to be ineffective in differentiating normalfrom abnormal laryngeal adductor function and theauthor does not recommend using it as part of anupper airway evaluation. 1 4. Upper Airway Endoscopy at Rest Endoscopy of the upper airway is then performed.The resting endoscopic examination is very impor-tant to determine whether there are any structuralor anatomic abnormalities present. Dynamic ab-normalities or problems that only occur at exercisewill not be detected during the resting examination.The clinician may get a sense of what is happeningat exercise but an evaluation of the airway at exer-cise is the only way to determine whether a dynamicproblem exists. The horse should be restrained ifnecessary but not sedated. Sedation can affect thefunction of the larynx, thus making assessment dif-cult. 2Following sedation the horse may exhibit asynchronous arytenoid movement or the inabilityto fully abduct one or both arytenoid cartilages.Therefore it is advisable to avoid sedating the horseto avoid these potential problems. Common meth-ods of restraint include twitch, lip chain, neck skinroll, and ear twitching. Some horses can be evalu-ated without using any of these techniques. Theendoscope is passed up the right nasal passage tothe level of the nasopharynx. The nasopharynxshould be evaluated for structural and functionalabnormalities. The width of the nasopharynx atthe level of the guttural pouch openings should beassessed. Horses that have collapse of the lateralpharyngeal walls during exercise often are very nar-row at this location. The width of the nasopharynxis a subjective assessment and the clinician shouldbe cautious about predicting the occurrence of adynamic problem (lateral pharyngeal collapse) froma resting examination. Nasopharyngeal cicatrixformation can be seen as scarring ranging from afocal area to involvement of the entire circumferenceof the nasopharynx. This abnormality is seen inhorses from hot climates such as Texas, Louisiana,Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Florida. The ethmoidturbinates and nasomaxillary sinus opening shouldbe examined. Abnormalities that could cause re-spiratory noise include an ethmoid hematoma thatis causing an obstruction in the nasal passage or amass protruding from the nasomaxillary openingobstructing the airway. Both guttural pouchesshould be beencountered pouch These abnormalitiesdo not directly cause abnormal respiratory noise butthey may lead to a problem such as dorsal displace-ment of the soft palate. The epiglottis should beevaluated for any structural abnormalities. Themost common abnormality would be epiglottic en-trapment. Some clinicians take note of the lengthand consistency of the epiglottis as well. The ven-tral surface of the epiglottis should be evaluated forulceration. This can be performed by elevating theepiglottic cartilage using a grasping instrumentpassed up the contralateral nasal passage. The po-sition of the soft palate with respect to the epiglottisshould be assessed. Some horses will displace theirsoft palate during the resting examination and re-place it after one to two swallows. Nasal occlusionis often used to assess soft-palate function but theclinician must remember that this test is not a re-placement for a dynamic examination. The degreeof pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia can be charac-terized. There is a grading system from one tofour. 3A Grade I would have a small number of inactive (white in color) lymphoid follicles spreadacross the aspect of the pharynx. A have inactive as well as active lymphoid fol-licles (edematous and pink in color) spread acrossthe dorsal aspect of nasopharynx to the level of theguttural-pouch openings. A Grade III would havelarger active follicles that may extend to the level ofthe soft palate. A Grade IV would have coalescingactive lymphoid follicles. Having severe lymphoidhyperplasia does not directly cause abnormal respi-ratory noise but the severe inflammation may leadto problems such as pharyngeal collapse or dorsaldisplacement of the soft palate, which would causethe abnormal respiratory noise. Each arytenoidcartilage should be evaluated for structure, symme-try, and movement. The shape and thickness ofeach arytenoid cartilage should be assessed. Agranuloma can form on the medial surface of thecorniculate cartilage while the remaining portion ofthe arytenoid cartilage or its movement is not af-fected. The movement of the arytenoid cartilagesshould be evaluated during normal resting respira-tion, after swallowing, and during nasal occlusion.The goal is to determine whether the structure ofthe arytenoid cartilages and the degree of abductionare normal. A grading scheme is used to categorizearytenoid symmetry and movement. 4A Grade I 30 2017 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO synchronous and symmetrical movement. AGrade II.1 has transient synchronous or asymmet-rical movement but maximal abduction is easilyachieved. A Grade II.2 has asynchronous or asym-metrical movement most of the time and maximalabduction is achieved but with difculty. A GradeIII.1 has asynchronous or asymmetrical movementand cannot maintain full abduction. A Grade III.2has limited arytenoid movement and cannot fullyabduct. A Grade III.3 has marked but not totalabductor decit. A Grade IV lacks any arytenoidmovement (completely paralyzed). Then examinethe right nasal passage as the endoscope is with-drawn. The nasal turbinates should be inspectedfor swelling, masses, or foreign material. The en-doscope is then passed through the left nasal pas-sage and the left ethmoid, nasomaxillary opening,and left guttural pouch are inspected. The tracheashould be evaluated for signs of infection, hemor-rhage, tracheal ring defects, granuloma formation,and for signs of prior trauma or surgery. In thetypical 450-kg horse the trachea can be examinednearly to the level of the tracheal bifurcation using a 1-m endoscope. The left nasal passage is then exam-ined as endoscope is withdrawn. nasal pas-sages, both guttural pouches, and the trachea shouldbe evaluated in each horse presented for a respiratoryevaluation. Laryngeal ultrasound provides a nonin-vasive technique to gain information regarding thelaryngeal cartilages and musculature. 5,6There are numerous upper-airway abnormalities that can be di-agnosed using standing endoscopy alone. The follow-ing are some examples of conditions that bediagnosed endoscopy: Epiglottic entrapment, subepiglottic and arytenoid granuloma examination may be required to get thefull picture of the horse's airway. 5. Upper Airway Endoscopy During Exercise There are many reasons to perform an endoscopicexamination of the upper airway while the horse isexercising/working. The dynamic examination canbe performed while the horse is exercising on a high-speed treadmill or by using overground or remote en-doscopy. The following are a basic list of reasons: The horse makes an abnormal respiratory noise and has a normal resting endoscopicexamination. The horse has an endoscopic abnormality at rest and you want to assess the effect atexercise. Poor performance (with or without abnormal respiratory noise). Screening test/pre-purchase examination. Assess the efcacy of a previous upper airway surgery.Examination on a high-speed treadmill should notbe taken lightly. It can be very dangerous for thehorse and people performing the examination.Problems do not occur very often but there is al-ways a risk for injury. However, this is the casewith any horse that is being exercised. In orderto get an accurate assessment of the horses' air-way function the treadmill examination mustmimic the type of work the horse does. It is veryimportant for show/sport horses to have the samehead and neck carriage when they are working onthe treadmill as they do when showing. Makesure the trainer/owner brings the necessary gearto set their head. Standardbreds should havetheir harness (including hopples if necessary).Thoroughbred racehorses typically do not needany special tack. Prior to the examination, dis-cuss with the trainer if the horse is currently inwork, their level of tness, and how much workthey are doing. It is also important to nd outunder what circumstances the horse exhibits theabnormality. Is it early in the workout? At theend of the workout? Once a certain speed isreached? When the head is in a certain position,etc.? Reviewing a race record can yield helpfulinformation regarding the distances and racetimes that the horse is achieving. Once you havedetermined that the horse is t enough and doesnot have a musculoskeletal reason that would pre-clude it from strenuous exercise, it is time to ac-climate the horse to the treadmill. The hind shoes are typically removed (leave the front shoes on) from the Thoroughbred racehorsesbut the shoes are left on the other breeds. Theshoes are very important for proper gait in most ofthe show horses so do not remove them. Protectivegear such as bell boots and sports-medicine boots arehelpful to prevent injuries. Standardbreds will of-ten wear knee boots or other protective equipment.A resting endoscopic examination should be per-formed in addition to a physical examination. Thehorse will be walked through the treadmill a fewtimes to get them comfortable with the footing andside bars. The horse is then taught to walk on thetreadmill. Once they are comfortable walking thepace will be increased to a trot then gallop if that isan appropriate gait for the horse. The acclimationprocess gives the horse a chance to get comfortablewith the treadmill as well as warm up for strenuousexercise. Most horses acclimate quickly. How-ever, there are certain horses that are difcult toacclimate and more time is necessary. It is a bigmistake to rush the process\u2014injury to the horse,people, and/or damaged equipment will be the endresult. There are horses that are not safe to tread-mill and the procedure should be abandoned. Dur-ing the acclimation phase watch for signs oflameness\u2014if present, perform a thorough lamenessexamination prior to increasing the exercise inten-sity. Once the horse is acclimated and comfortableworking on the treadmill, the endoscope should be AAEP PROCEEDINGS 63 /H114082017 31HOW ENDOSCOPY IN PRACTICEpassed up the right nasal passage (or left dependingon how the treadmill is set up) and secured to thenose band on the halter. There are a variety ofways to secure the scope in position. The scopeshould not be so secure that it will be damaged if thehorse decides to go backward. Positioning the endof the endoscope in the nasopharynx is very impor-tant. The tip of the endoscope should be rostral tothe epiglottis but not so far rostral that you do nothave a good view of the larynx. Once the endoscopeis positioned and secured, the treadmill examinationshould commence. Ensure that the video recordingdevice is capturing video. A recording device iscritical to document the examination and allow youto replay the video in slow motion for critical evalu-ation. The treadmill speed is increased until theappropriate speed is reached. The horse's gait andspeed are dependent on the type of work the horseperforms. For example, a Thoroughbred racehorseshould be galloping at race speed. The clinicianmust watch the video endoscopy as well as haveawareness of how the horse is doing on the tread-mill. During the examination, listen for abnormalrespiratory noise and correlate that noise with thevideo image. If there is abnormal respiratory noiseand no visible abnormality, then the problem is ei-ther rostral to the end of the endoscope or caudal tothe larynx. Repositioning of the endoscope will benecessary and the examination repeated. Thespeed may need to be increased, decreased, or main-tained. Once the examination is completed thenthe endoscope should be removed and the horse iscooled out. During this time the video endoscopicexamination can be reviewed. It is crucial to haveslow-motion review capabilities to fully assess theairway. The initial workup is the same whether the clini- cian is planning to perform a treadmill or over-ground examination. The ability to performoverground or remote endoscopy allows the clinicianto examine the horse in the exact environment andtype of work that the horse typically performs.This is very important so that the clinician gets anaccurate assessment of the horse's upper-airwayfunction during exercise. In the author's opinion,overground endoscopy is superior to endoscopywhile exercising on a treadmill when evaluatingsport horses or show horses. It is very hard if notimpossible to replicate the type of work these horsesare performing by evaluating them on a treadmill.Rider influence is an important component that islost when using a treadmill. The endoscope shouldbe positioned in the nasopharynx so that the clini-cian has an appropriate image of the upper airway.Care must be taken so the endoscope is not posi-tioned too close or too far away from the larynx.You must also factor in the effect of a change in headposition while the horse is at work compared withresting. The horse should be tacked up and theendoscope should be positioned appropriately. Theorder in which the tack and endoscope are placedwill depend on the system that you are using. Thehorse should be warmed up and then examined.While the horse is warming up, the position of theendoscope can be assessed and changed if necessary.Prior to starting the examination, the recording de-vice should be turned on and made sure that video isbeing captured. It is critical that the horse isworked in the same manner that creates the \"abnor-mality.\" The big advantage of overground endos-copy is that horses can be examined in essentiallythe exact manner that causes the upper-airway ab-normality. Post-exercise evaluation of the over-ground examination is the same as described above. There are multiple dynamic abnormalities that can occur in the upper airway. The list includesbut is not limited to the following: intermittentdorsal displacement of the soft palate, medial devi-ation of one or both aryepiglottic folds, pharyngealcollapse, medial deviation of one or both vocal of one or both arytenoid cartilages, epiglot-tic retroversion, tracheal collapse, billowing of therostral aspect of the soft palate, epiglottic entrap-ment, and combinations of these problems. Thistype of examination allows the clinician to deter-mine which treatment options are necessary and/orfeasible. There are certain abnormalities or combi-nations of abnormalities that may not have a viabletreatment. In summary, resting and dynamic or overground endoscopy are vital to making an accurate diagnosisin a horse with a suspected upper airway problem.There are instances where a resting examination isall that is needed to make a diagnosis such as a casewith Grade IV left laryngeal hemiplegia. However,the clinician must remember that resting endoscopyis often a very poor indicator of upper airway func-tion during exercise. It is advisable to take a step-wise approach when trying to determine whether ahorse has an upper airway problem that is causingpoor performance. The steps include taking a de-tailed history, a physical examination, and perform-ing a thorough resting endoscopy. Based on thesendings a dynamic or overground endoscopy may berequired to fully evaluate the horse's upper airwayfunction. The list of reasons to perform a dynamicendoscopic examination include, but are not limitedto, the following: The horse makes an abnormal respiratory noise and has a normal resting endoscopicexamination. The horse has an endoscopic abnormality at rest and you want to assess the effect atexercise. Poor performance (with or without abnormal respiratory noise). Screening test/pre-purchase examination. Assess the efcacy of a previous upper airway surgery. 32 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO PERFORM ENDOSCOPY IN EQUINE PRACTICEAcknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veter-inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

Introduction Endoscopic evaluation of the upper airway of horsespresented at public auction is an important part ofthe overall assessment of sales horses for suitabilityfor either racing or resale. Although considered acommon and relatively simple procedure, there areaspects to the examination that can make it simplerto perform and more understandable for both sellersand potential buyers. First of all, in order to facilitate the passing of the endoscope, it is advantageous to use an endoscopewith a small diameter (beroptic endoscope with a7.6-mm diameter that is relatively well tolerated byhorses of all ages). This will decrease the discom-fort that the horse experiences and therefore facili-tate the passage of the endoscope. Also, once thedistal tip of the endoscope has been introduced intothe nares, the ngers should no longer contact thenares while advancing the scope given that horsestend to object to that contact and will settle downonce nasal manipulation has ceased. This is impor-tant because many of the horses presented for saleat public auction will be scoped multiple timeswithin 1 or more days prior to the sale so goodtechnique can minimize a horse's discomfort andpossible trauma to horse and/or handler. Most vet-erinarians are introducing the scope into the rightnares, but that is not universal. It must be remem-bered that as the scope is advanced to the level of thepharynx and larynx, there is by denition only onenasal passage being evaluated for any potential pa-thology regardless of which nares is entered. Thisis unlikely to be an issue in a population of primarilynormal horses, but in the context of a horse withclinical signs of airway insufciency both sidesshould be evaluated for a complete examination. As in most medical procedures, the correct inter- pretation of the ndings is more challenging thanthe actual performing of the procedure. In the caseof upper airway examination and evaluation, it isnot only the interpretation of the ndings but thecommunication of that information to clients andcolleagues that requires a standardized system.The use of a standardized system enhances the abil-ity to describe the upper airway and communicatethe ndings with colleagues and clients. It is im-portant that a standardized grading system for theupper airway incorporate the elements of being asobjective as possible and easy to understand whilebeing descriptive of the areas of interest. Thereare two standardized systems in current usage, theHavemeyer and the Modied Cornell. 1-3They are both standardized classication systems basedon description of arytenoid function. The grade 34 /H11408Vol. /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO PERFORM ENDOSCOPY IN EQUINE PRACTICE NOTEScategories range from Grade 1 to Grade 4 with sev-eral subcategories. The number \"1\" is synonymouswith the word \"symmetric,\" Grade 1 arytenoidfunction means that the arytenoids open symmetri-cally, fully abduct, and hold their position. Thenumber \"2\" is synonymous with the word \"asymmet-ric.\" Grade 2 function means that the arytenoidsopen asymmetrically, fully abduct, and hold theirposition. Grade 2 function is broken down into twocategories, 2A and 2B (Modied Cornell) synonymouswith the word A 2A or 2.1 designationwould mean that the arytenoids open mildly asym-metrically, fully abduct, and hold. Similarly, the\"B\" of 2B is synonymous with the word \"moderate.\"Thus, a 2B or 2.2 designation means that the aryte-noids have a moderate level of asymmetry whenabducting, but the abduction is full and the aryte-noids are able to hold in the fully abducted position.Grades 1, 2A, and 2B (or 1, 2.1, and 2.2) arytenoidfunction are all variations of a normal upper airway.Statistically there is no difference in the racingperformance of horses with Grade 1, Grade 2A(2.1), and Grade 2B (2.2) function (note: presentresearch suggests that racehorses with Grade 2Bfunction are equivalent in earnings with their Grade1 and 2A counterparts at age 3 years, but havedecreased earnings at 2 and 4. 4,5a Grade 3 function is the designation for an aryte- noid that may either achieve abduction only tran-siently and with difculty or may not fully abduct.There are three subdivisions of Grade 3 function inthe Havemeyer system to designate the level of com-promised function. Grade 4 function is the desig-nation reserved for an arytenoid that does not move(laryngeal hemiplegia). Grades 3 and 4 arytenoidfunction are not normal. Grade 3 and Grade 4 air-ways do not meet Conditions of Sale at all four of theThoroughbred sales companies in the United States.In the author's opinion, the Havemeyer and Modi-ed Cornell systems for grading laryngeal functionare similar enough that any veterinarian employingone of these systems can fully understand the alter-nate system. The epiglottis is evaluated separately from aryte- noid function. It is graded as normal, mildly flac-cid, moderately flaccid, or severely flaccid. Thelength of the epiglottis is noted as normal or short.Interestingly, given that the epiglottis is under au-tonomic nerve control, the appearance of the epiglot-tis can change from examination to examination oreven within the same examination. If during theexamination the epiglottic appearance changes frommoderately flaccid to completely normal, the au-thor's approach is to assume that the structure hasthe capability to achieve normalcy. It is difcult touse the appearance of the epiglottis as predictive ofupper airway dysfunction because there is no scien-tic evidence correlating mild or even moderate flac-cidity of the epiglottis to clinical dorsal displacementof the soft palate. 4The position of the epiglottis iscontrolled by the hyoepiglotticus muscle, and its ap-pearance can vary based on the degree of muscularcontraction or relaxation. 6Eliciting swallowing during the examination can give the examining vet-erinarian an idea of whether there is dorsal dis-placement of the soft palate over the epiglottis, andif so whether the horse is able to easily replace theepiglottis in its normal position. Many horses atpublic auction will intermittently dorsally displacethe palate due to nervousness related to new sur-rounding or the scoping procedure itself, and thisshould not be interpreted as predictive of clinicaldorsal displacement of the soft palate creating air-way insufciency under racing conditions. 4 Guttural pouches are noted for whether or not there is an exudate of any kind emanating from theorice, and the pharynx is evaluated for the pres-ence and magnitude of pharyngitis as well as anypolyps or abnormal structures. It is very commonat public auction for weanlings, yearlings, and2-year-olds in training to exhibit pharyngeal inflam-mation manifested by varying degrees of pharyngi-tis and exudate emanating from the guttural pouchopenings. In my opinion, these ndings do not con-stitute a reason for avoiding a purchase, but ratherare an indication that an individual may requiretreatment and further evaluation after purchase. Conditions of Sale All US sales companies have \"Conditions of Sale,\"some of which refer specically to conditions of theupper airway. These are included to protect thebuyer from purchasing a horse with an upper airwaycondition that would be acknowledged to be patho-logical. Already referenced would be the horsewith either a Grade 3 or Grade 4 arytenoid function.In the sales catalog, this would be listed as laryngealhemiplegia (complete immobility or inability to fullyabduct the cartilage). Other airway abnormalitiesthat are covered by conditions of sale are listedbelow: Rostral displacement of the palatopharyngeal arch Epiglottic entrapment Permanent dorsal displacement of or arytenoid chondroma(s) Subepiglottic cyst(s) of these conditions, a post-sale endoscopicexamination of the upper airway is sufcient to pro-tect the buyer as a horse with any of these conditionswould be subject to return. (Note: rostral dis- placement of the palatopharyngeal arch and epiglot-tic entrapment may each be transient, which isobviously problematic when a horse has beendeemed normal on a pre-sale basis and exhibits thecondition endoscopically AAEP EQUINE PRACTICEThe value of the pre-sale endoscopic evaluation of the upper airway at rest in the stall has proven to beless predictive of airway performance since the ad-vent of dynamic or over-ground endoscopy. 7,bThe purpose of \"holding off \" the horses' air during theresting endoscopic examination is to cause the horseto breathe deeply to observe maximal arytenoidabduction, but dynamic endoscopy gives a betterpicture of the function of the upper airway atsomething approaching racing distance. It hasbeen observed that many (if not most) of the patho-logical conditions resulting in airway insufciencyas diagnosed by dynamic endoscopy would not havebeen evident during a resting endoscopic examina-tion in the stall. 8For this reason, it is important for practitioners to be cautious in making certainpredictions: for example, potential laryngeal hemi-plegia based upon a resting arytenoid asymmetry,or predicting a clinical dorsal displacement of thesoft palate based upon a resting examination wherethe horse displaces. The more information thatwe get from dynamic upper airway examinations,the more that we realize that resting endoscopy is ascreening tool for more obvious ndings. For example, there is another condition which, although not yet covered by Conditions of Sale atany of the Thoroughbred auction houses, has in re-cent years been recognized to predispose horses to ahigher incidence of airway collapse than endoscopi-cally normal horses. Subluxation lux-ation) of the apices of the arytenoid cartilages, andthe recognition of this condition, requires that thehorse's air be held off to stimulate deep breathingand maximal arytenoid movement. 9This is accom - plished by collapsing the external nares with thesame hand that is holding the scope in place on thebridge of the nose and releasing the nares oncethe horse is breathing deeply. The actual airwaycollapse can only be appreciated under dynamic conditions. Similarly, during a resting pre-saleendoscopic examination in the stall, the width of thepharynx at the level of the guttural pouches is eval-uated, and horses with a narrow pharynx have in-creased risk of lateral pharyngeal collapse, whichcan only be appreciated during a dynamic endo-scopic examination. b In 2016 the idea of performing videoendoscopic exams of the upper airway of sales horses for pre-sale viewing at public auction resurfaced, andthe American Association of Equine Practitioners(AAEP) was charged with providing guidelines forsuch examinations. The idea behind consignorsproviding pre-sale videos of the upper airway was tominimize the number of pre-sale scopes on any in-dividual horse and thus minimize the potential fortrauma to either the horses themselves or their han-dlers. An AAEP working group constructed thefollowing Protocol for Pre-Sale Videoendoscopic Ex-amination of the Upper Airway at Public Auctionwhich was subsequently approved by the AAEPBoard of Directors:Equipment must be capable of producing a digital video image of excellent quality. Horse must be identied appropriately, and that identication must be in digital formatwith character generation on the screen,and/or video of the catalog page, followed byunbroken video of the face prior to introductionof the scope into the nares (right or left) and upto the larynx. This is a single stream videowith no editing. The veterinarian performingthe video or the consignor will submit eachupper airway video on an individual flashdrive or CD. Upper airway videos should bestored in a le separate from the radiographsin the repository in case of client request forone orthe other. Standard technique must include maximal ab- duction of arytenoids induced by swallowing(multiple times) and nasal occlusion. The du-ration of the video must be sufcient to iden-tify all laryngeal and pharyngeal structures aswell as observing their maximal functionwithin the context of a resting examination. The interval between the pre-sale videoendo- scopic examination and the selling session willnot exceed 10 days. The 10-day interval mentioned above was consid-ered by all to be a compromise between the desire toevaluate the upper airway as close to the sellingsession as possible and the practicality of perform-ing a large number (perhaps thousands) of videoen-doscopic examinations in a short window of time(1-2 weeks). Ideally, buyers like their veterinari-ans to perform that examination either on the day ofthe sale or 1-2 days prior due to the possibility of adeterioration of the upper airway function duringthe time between the examination and selling date.The idea has been introduced that a condition of salebe created to ensure that the upper airway of thehorse as observed endoscopically on a post-sale basisapproximates the pre-sale videoendoscopic exami-nation. An example of the wording that has beendiscussed for a new condition of sale would be: Post-sale endoscopic examination of the upperairway must be performed within 24 hours ofselling session while the horse is still on thesalesgrounds. In the case that the upper airwaydoes not meet conditions of sale as delineated inCondition ___, the horse shall be returned. Inthe case that the upper airway is signicantlydifferent from the pre-sale video but still techni-cally meets conditions of sale, the seller may getan opinion from the veterinarian of his or herchoice. If the opinions agree that the upper air-way is signicantly different from the pre-salevideo, the horse shall be returned. If the rstand second veterinary opinions disagree, a panelof three veterinarians will render an opinion andthat opinion shall be binding. 36 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO PERFORM ENDOSCOPY IN EQUINE PRACTICESuch a condition could be a potential solution to the timing of the videos, but is not currently beingconsidered as the concept of upper airway videos atthe sales is in its infancy. The positive result ofsuch a condition would be that it addresses the issueof any changes that may occur in the upper airwayduring the 10 days between the pre-sale videoendo-scopic examination and the selling session. Thenegative aspect of creating such a condition of salewould be that instead of a sale being nal at the dropof the hammer, the horse could be subject to returneven if its upper airway technically meets the tradi-tional conditions of sale. After the evaluation of the upper airway by endos- copy, it is important to communicate the ndings tothe client in a way that is understandable and con-veys the information as risk assessment. Findings,in and of themselves, do not necessarily eliminate ahorse from consideration for purchase. Especiallyin the case of pre-sale examinations, it is importantto emphasize that the risk level is predicated uponobservations regarding populations of horses, andthat it is not possible to predict what will occurwith any individual horse. For example, althoughGrade 2B arytenoid asymmetry is considered to be avariation of normal, many express concern that theexamination is just one point in time and that asubsequent examination may reveal the asymmetryto have progressed to dysfunction. If the horse inquestion is presented for sale as a yearling, and mayhave had a Grade 2B arytenoid function score as aweanling, the historical information allows practi-tioners to report a stable arytenoid function overtime. It is important to communicate all these con-siderations to the client while discussing their levelof risk tolerance. Clients with greater understand-ing of the conversation typically have a higher risktolerance, and they also understand that the upperairway ndings are but one factor in the making of aracehorse, albeit an important one. Radiographicndings, pedigree, conformation, history, and otherfactors also play a part in a client's ultimate decisionas to whether or not they will purchase any givenindividual horse. In summary, the appropriate equipment and tech- nique can greatly facilitate the examination of theupper airway under resting conditions at public auc-tion. The anatomical areas of interest are the na-sopharynx and larynx, with particular emphasis onthe structure and function of the arytenoid carti-lages as well as the appearance of the epiglottis.The endoscopic examination of the upper airway inthe resting horse, when performed properly, is capa-ble of detecting some structural and functional ab-normalities, but is limited in the sense that thereare some abnormalities that can only be detectedunder dynamic conditions (i.e., over-ground endos-copy). The purpose of pre-sale endoscopy is to notonly identify observable abnormalities of the upperairway, but also to identify and describe variationsof normal which may be interpreted differently re-garding their level of risk by various veterinariansand thus affect the market value of the individualhorse. A comprehensive discussion of how to com-municate the aforementioned ndings to sellers orpotential buyers is difcult because each client hastheir own unique level of understanding and risktolerance, so the suitability of any given individualhorse may vary depending upon the client. Inother words, the same horse may be suitable for oneclient but not another. This is true of all ndings,whether they are endoscopic ndings of the repository radiographs, or physical examina-tion ndings. Ideally, the examining veterinarian should strive to communicate to the client what is knownfrom the literature regarding the upper airwayexamination: 1. Thoroughbred yearlings with Grade 1 and Grade 2 arytenoid function had signicantlybetter racing performance as adults, com-pared with yearlings with Grade 3 arytenoidfunction. 2. Epiglottic flaccidity and palatine abnormalities were not predictive of inferior racing perfor-mance 4; however, a short epiglottis was asso - ciated with decreased racing performance.5 The purpose of post-sale endoscopy is primarily toidentify any abnormalities of the upper airway thatwould be covered by conditions of sale and thereforenegate the purchase of the horse. Any variations ofnormal that would be identied on a post-sale exam-ination should be communicated to the buying clientas potentially affecting resale of the horse, butwould notmake the horse eligible for return to the seller.

In the past decade, the veterinary pro-fession has fostered an increased interest inequine dentistry. This has led to the publicationof scientic papers that have focused on thebenet of a thorough oral examination. Peer-reviewed papers have been published specicallyon equine oral anatomy, oral pathology, and meth-ods to perform the oral examination. 1,2The basic instruments needed for the oral examination, in asedated patient, are a full-mouth speculum, amouth mirror, and a bright light source. Docu-menting the oral exam ndings has historicallybeen through written text in a medical record orbetter yet recorded on an equine dental chart.Intra-oral images in the mouth have been ob-tained by taking a picture of the mouth mirrorreflecting the pathology. This can be a difculttask in the standing sedated patient and imagequality is less than desirable. Oral endoscopycan allow excellent visualization of the dentitionwith a convenient method of capturing images. Technology has now become part of our every- day life as a practitioner. Modern equine prac-tices now have the ability to capture and storepictures pertaining to many aspects of the pa-tient's medical record in their practice database.This bolsters the medical record for purposes ofmonitoring and communicating with other practi-tioners and owners. The equine oral cavity haschallenges of examining structures in a dark tun-nel that often does not lend itself to easily beingphotographed. A camera of a cell phone or a gooddigital camera has often been used in conjunctionwith a mouth mirror to capture images of perti-nent pathology. Recently, boroscopes and smalldigital capture devices have become available forother industries that make capturing images ina wet, poorly lit environment possible. Peer-reviewed papers and textbook chapters have beenpublished describing many uses of oral endoscopysystems. 3-6 In this article, we will discuss the common de- vices that are commercially available and the com-ponents that can be individually sourced to buildyour own system. Pros and cons of each systemwill be discussed to aid the practitioner in pur-chasing the correct system for their practice.This is not a complete list of all endoscopic sys-tems available for use in the oral cavity but rathera representation of systems that are being usedroutinely in the horse. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 39HOW TO PERFORM ENDOSCOPY IN EQUINE PRACTICE NOTES2. Materials and Methods The practitioner must identify their goal for use oforal endoscopy equipment. Questions that need tobe answered: 1. Will the system be utilized in the eld?2. Will the system be utilized primarily to show the client their horse's oral examination? 3. Will the primary use of the system be to cap- ture images for the medical record and/or forpublication in medical journals? 4. Do you currently utilize endoscopy in your practice? If the goal is high-resolution images for publication,this needs to be decided early in the progression ofsetting up your system so that a camera can bechosen that will produce high-resolution images.If the goal is to produce images for medical recordsand to demonstrate ndings to the client, all thedescribed systems in this paper will perform nicely.All equine patients receiving an oral exam can beexamined with an oral scope. The systems that are commonly utilized for oral endoscopy can be broken down into two categories: 1. Systems that are commercially available.2. The do-it-yourself (DIY) systems where the practitioner compiles the componentsthemselves. Commercially Available Systems These systems have a vast range in price, imagequality, and function. The practitioner must de-cide for themselves what ts their budget and howthis instrumentation will benet their practice.Below is a list of commercially available systemsfrom least expensive to most expensive. It is by nomeans a complete list but is a list of commonly useddevices by practitioners. 1. Eezy-view camera a 2. Portascope Dental stickb 3. Stoll Oral endoscope packagec 4. Dr Fritz Dental Stickd 5. MDS Scope source flexible endoscopee DIY-Assembled Systems These systems are compiled from different sourcessuch as Ebay or endoscopy instrument suppliers.Many imaging towers can be outtted with a rigidendoscope to capture images in the oral cavity.There are a few important features of the systemthat need to be present in order to obtain images inthe oral cavity. The eld of view angle, a brightlight source, and the quality of the camera one usesto obtain the image. Cameras are either a USBcamera designed to clip onto the ridged scope or acamera adapter tted to a standard digital camerathat allows it to attach to the scope. Many of thedigital cameras have wireless communication capa-bility that allows the image viewing and capturingto be performed on a tablet device. Clients and thepractitioner can use the larger screen of the tablet toview the oral cavity and even record voice descrip-tions of the exam. Below is an example of compo-nents to build your DIY systems. 1. Rigid endoscope with 30\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 eld of view with a minimum length of 30 cm. The StorzEndocameleon is a specialized scope thathas a variable viewing angle from 0\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 f. 2. USB high-denition camera with capturing software or camera mount to digital camera orsmart phone. 3. Endoscopic light source preferably battery- operated light-emitting diode (LED). 4. Storage device such as laptop, secure digital (SD) card, USB drive, or cloud storage. 3. Results Commercially available systems will often have awarranty and will often provide some form of train-ing to best use the system for your practice. Thesesystems will range in price from inexpensive to sev-eral thousands of dollars. The image quality willhave a direct correlation to cost. Eezy-View Camera This system has a 90\u00b0 viewing angle, a rotatablejoint at the viewing head so that the handle andviewing screen can remain in an upright position,LED light source, and wireless capability to multipleLCD monitors. The diameter is 10 mm with a shaftlength of 43 cm. The image le size is low but issuitable for medical records and documentation.The price of the system is under $700.00 US. Extrawireless LCD monitors are $325.00 US. Storage ofthe images is to a removable SD card (Fig. 1). Portascope Dental Stick This system has a scope that is 6 mm in diameterand 23 cm long. There is a cord between the scopeand the LCD screen. The price is advertised at Fig. 1.

Image quality is good and adequatefor demonstrating ndings to owners. The abilityto store images with this system is not known.Wi capability can be added to this system (Fig. 2). Stoll Oral Endoscope This system is an excellent system for examination,demonstrating oral ndings to clients, and visualiz-ing oral surgical procedures, and produces high-quality images for recordkeeping and publishing.The system utilizes a light source that is powered bya USB port from the laptop computer. The basiccomponents are a Storz ridged endoscope, StorzUSB light Various Storz rigid endoscopes can beutilized with the system. Price for the system isapproximately $6000.00 US without the laptop.There is an option for this system to have irrigationto rinse debris from the viewing head (Fig. 3). Dr. Fritz Dental Stick This wireless system has several different congu-rations. The endoscope viewing angle is 90\u00b0 withLEDs as the light source. The focal distance tendsto be close to the structure being imaged making itslightly difcult to orientate yourself in the mouth. The image is sent wirelessly to a tablet device. The endoscope has rechargeable battery packs thatare interchangeable. Storage of the images is viathe tablet's storage capabilities. This system pro-duces a nice image and is extremely portable. Thecost of the system is $6000.00 to $8000.00 US, de-pending on options that one wants to purchase withthe system (Fig. 4). MDS Scope Source Flexible Video Endoscope This is a system that utilizes a four-way directionalflexible endoscope with irrigation and biopsy chan-nel. The diameter is 8 mm and the length is 140cm. The digital image produced is excellent for dem-onstrating ndings to clients and for publishable- quality images. The small diameter of the scopeallows the end to be bent in a close radius allowingvisualization from 0\u00b0 to 120\u00b0. A protective sheathof nylon is custom made and slid over the scope endto protect it from abrasive areas of the teeth. Thesheath also serves as a handle and provides rigidityto the end of the scope while in the mouth. Porta-bility is hampered; however, there are options forcases to contain the components. The system hasthe added advantage of being able to perform upperairway exams as well with the protective nylonsheath removed. Cost of the entire system is/H11011$13,000 US (Fig. 5). DIY-assembled systems may come with a war- ranty on certain components but overall the systemwill not be warranteed. The system will also notcome with training specic to the horse's mouth.The operator will have to be willing to trouble-shootproblems that arise with the system. All of thefollowing systems described demonstrate differentcamera options that can be attached to a ridgedendoscope. The practitioner must rst purchase arigid endoscope (Fig. 6) with specications listedabove and couple that with a camera. The Storzendocameleon has a variable viewing angle from 0\u00b0to 120\u00b0 degrees (Fig. 7). Rigid scopes can range inprice from used of $1000.00 US to new prices up to Fig. 2.

Smartphone DIY System This system has a smartphone adapter that enablesa smartphone to be attached directly to the rigidendoscope. A light source is also needed. Thesmartphone adapters are priced around $600 to$800 US (Fig. 8). DIY USB Camera and Standard Digital Camera Systems Several endoscope cameras are available that mountto the endoscope with a USB connection to a laptop(Fig. 9). Mounts can be purchased that allow digi-tal cameras to be attached directly to the endoscope(Fig. 10). Light sources are still needed to providelight through the ber optics of the scope. USBcameras can range from a few hundred dollars toseveral thousand dollars depending on imagequality. Medical Case Selection The cases that are especially pertinent to utilize anendoscope are patients that have small oral cavitiesthat are difcult to inspect with a dental mirror.Patients that have progressive pathology such asperiodontal disease or endodontic decay lend wellto having images captured for the medical recordto document progression and response to treat-ments. Patients with trauma or that have anextremely painful condition in the oral cavity areoften best examined with an oral scope to mini-mize the amount of stimulation in the oral cavitywith bulky instrumentation. In the author's practice the horse is sedated, a full-mouth speculum is placed and the mouth isrinsed free of organic debris. The horse needs to besedated to the point of minimal tongue movement.The author prefers to still utilize a mouth mirror toquickly inspect the oral cavity and then perform adetailed inspection with the oral scope. The max-illary quadrants of the teeth are inspected rst vi-sualizing each tooth in entirety looking at thesurface of each pulp horn and each infundibulum(Fig. 11). The scope is rocked slightly sidewayslooking at the buccal and lingual surfaces for evi-dence of periodontal disease and cemental decay(Fig. 12). If the particular scope that is being usedis 0\u00b0 to 45\u00b0, the soft palate and caudal oral cavity canalso be inspected for soft-tissue lesions. The man-dibular quadrants are inspected in a similar man-ner. The tongue will often have to be gently movedtoward the opposite quadrant to visualize the lin-gual surface and the areas under the tongue. If thehorse is resistant or is having increased tonguemovement lidocaine jelly or lidocaine solution can be Fig. 5. MDS Scope source 8-mm flexible endoscope shown withthe protective nylon sheath.

Discussion The practitioner that is providing dental services isencouraged to consider adding oral endoscopy totheir practice. The main reasons would include theability to provide a more thorough examination, al-low the clients to visualize the exam with the prac-titioner, and the ability to allow documentation ofthe examination for following pathologic conditions.The practitioner must choose a system that ts theneeds of the practice.

AAEP TO PERFORM ENDOSCOPY IN EQUINE PRACTICEThe practitioner must rst decide their budget as it is hard to effectively increase one's prot with anoral scope over proper use of a dental mirror. Ithowever does increase one's marketing of the oralexam to the client with images and the ability to addthem into the medical record. The author utilizes aflexible endoscope for in clinic procedures that storesthe images automatically into a patient le that ison Dropbox. This allows easy sharing of the im-ages between practitioners and the safety of cloudbackup. The flexible endoscope has the benet ofbeing able to change the angle of viewing and inpatients with sinus disease, this system can be uti-lized to perform upper airway exams or sinoscopy.The one drawback to this system is the lack of easytransportation. The commercially available systems that are in- expensive are good for the practitioner that wants toshow clients the examination and to document pa-thology in the medical record. The image qualitywill not be of publishable quality nor do they havethe ability to have irrigation. Irrigation is a must ifthe practitioner wants to perform endoscopic-guidedintraoral surgery. In the present time, the flexibleendoscope and the Stoll systems with a Storz scopeand USB camera are the only ones with true irriga-tion capabilities. The DIY systems are for the practitioner that has some technology in their background. One must becareful to not spend more money piecing a systemtogether, than if you had bought a commerciallyavailable system that would have training and awarranty. There are several things to beware of when shopping for a system. Wireless systems aregreat and extremely portable. The disadvantageof some of the wireless systems can be connectiv-ity. One should always demo a system beforepurchase and compare several systems. Therecan be a wide variety of focal distances and area ofviewing that can make them hard to operate.For instance, a scope that has trouble getting afull tooth in view at a time can make it hard tokeep track of which tooth you are viewing duringthe exam. It is better to have a scope that canfocus at different lengths to be able to get anoverall view of the quadrant and then move in toexamine the pathologic lesion closely. 5. Conclusion The are many options for systems to examine anddocument the oral examination ndings. The prac-titioner should spend ample time and demo severalsystems to nd the system that is right for theirpractice situation. Fig. 11. Left, Axially rotated 109 with diastema at 108 and 109 tooth.

Nasal discharge is often the common clinical sign ofsinus disease noted by the horse owner. Nasal dis-charge may be caused by both primary sinusitis(bacterial or fungal infection) or secondary sinusitis(dental disease, ethmoid hematoma, sinus cyst, neo-plasia). Whatever the cause may be, the most com-monly performed diagnostics are skull radiographsand nasal endoscopy. Sinoscopy is another diag-nostic tool that is minimally invasive and can beperformed in the standing horse by both specialistsand general practitioners. 1With a complete/accu- rate understanding of sinus anatomy and access toa flexible or rigid endoscope, sinoscopy can increasea practitioner's diagnostic capabilities. Further-more, sinoscopy can be used for sample collection forhistologic examination and microbial culture and atherapeutic tool for manually removing inspissatedpus or foreign material from numerous sinus com-partments. One study claims 69% resolution ofparanasal sinus disease after sinoscopy and lavage. 2 More recent studies by Perkins et al3,4evaluated numerous trephination sites for sinoscopy andshowed that a combination approach to the sinusesvia sinoscopy is very useful for diagnosis and treat-ment of sinus disease. From the authors' experience, sinoscopy is ex- tremely helpful as a diagnostic tool, but has limitedvalue for treatment of sinus disease. Fortunately,a sinoscopy procedure does not prevent the ability toperform additional, more invasive sinusotomy pro-cedures when sinoscopic treatment options are un-successful. To most effectively use this diagnosticand therapeutic option, it is important that the prac-titioner understand sinoscopy capabilities and limi-tations. The objectives of this how-to article are 1)to describe equine sinoscopy via multiple trephi-nation sites, and 2) describe the sinus anatomy asit pertains to sinoscopy via multiple trephinationsites so that general practitioners may effectivelyuse this diagnostic and therapeutic technique intheir practice. 2. Materials and Methods With standing sedation (alpha-2 agonist /H11006opiate) and local anesthesia, a small can be placed in conchofrontal (CFS) orrostral (RMS) and/or caudal maxillary sinus (CMS)compartment for direct evaluation via a rigid orflexible endoscope. In prolonged procedures, a con-stant-rate infusion may be used as well and hasbeen described by Vigani et al. 5Traditionally, the following portals have been used: for the CMS, 2cm rostral and 2 cm ventral to the medial canthus ofthe eye; for the RMS, 50% of the distance from therostral end of the facial crest to the level of themedial canthus and 1 cm ventral to a and 0.5 cm caudal to themedial canthus (Fig. The author recommends using a Galt Trephine ( 12-34in.) for sinus trephination. Once the trephi- nation site has been located, the area should beclipped and prepped for sterile surgery. A localanesthetic is placed along the line of the proposedincision. A linear incision twice the length of thediameter of the trephine is made through the skinand the periosteum in a single incision. Alterna-tively, a U-shaped or semicircular incision can becreated. The periosteum is elevated at the surgicalsite so as to preserve the periosteum during thetrephination procedure. The centralized pin ofthe Galt Trephine is centered within the incisionsite and seated within the bone to hold the trephinethreads in place during the procedure. It is impor-tant to perform the trephination with smooth andflat rotations of the wrist during the trephinationprocedure. Try to avoid \"rocking\" of the trephine.It is recommended to cut slowly through the bone,checking the depth frequently and leaving only athin shell of bone that can be removed with a hemo-stat following the procedure. This prevents thebone fragment from falling into the sinus as well ashelping to avoid any damage to sinus structureswhen the trephine breaks through the bone. A rigid or flexible endoscope can be used for sinos- copy. There are advantages and disadvantages toboth. A flexible endoscope is capable of flexing inmultiple directions and looks directly forward (0 \u00b0), which allows for improved access to numerous sinuscompartments. A flexible endoscope also has a bi-opsy channel as well as pressurized air and waterthat can be used to clear the camera when fogged orcovered with blood, mucus, etc. Unfortunately, aflexible endoscope can be expensive and is at higherrisk of damage when used in the sinus compart-ments if dragged against a rough edge creating dam-age to the seal of the scope. A rigid endoscope canalso be used with success. Rigid scopes come innumerous angles (0 \u00b0,3 0\u00b0,4 5\u00b0,9 0\u00b0). It is mended a rigid endoscope with 30\u00b0or less. Rigid endoscopy is becoming commonplace in den-tistry and many of these dental oroscopes could beused successfully in sinoscopy. Although most commonly used for diagnostic pur- poses, sinoscopy can be a helpful therapeutic tool aswell. Both debridement and lavage of specic sinuscompartments can be aided by the use of sinoscopy.Debridement can be performed through a secondarytrephination hole using a series of Ferris-Smithronguers, endoscopic grasping forceps, or curettes.In addition, if target the removal of a specic object. 3. Results Structures within the paranasal sinus compart-ments such as the play role in under-standing surgical anatomy of the paranasal sinusesand if able to be identied, serve as landmarks forparanasal sinus surgery. When identied, thesefour structures will guide the surgeon throughoutsinoscopic exploration. To simplify the complexityof the equine paranasal sinuses, the author likes tofollow a few simple rules during surgical explora-tion: 1) if dorsal to the frontomaxillary aperture,the scope is within the dorsal conchal sinus 2) aperture and abaxial to infraorbital ca-nal, the scope the CMS; 3) if ventral tofrontomaxillary aperture and axial to the infraor-bital canal, the scope is approaching the sphenopal-atine sinus compartment; 4) if caudal to the septumof the maxillary sinuses, the scope is within theCMS; 5) if rostral to the septum of the maxillarysinuses, the scope is within the RMS or ventralconchal sinus (VCS); 5) if rostral to infraorbital within and if toseptum of the maxillary sinuses and axial to infraor-bital canal, then the scope is within the VCS (Fig. 2,A-C). It is important to realize that the septum of the maxillary sinuses separates the VCS and RMS fromthe rest of the sinus compartments. When per-forming sinoscopy via a CFS approach, the septummust be broken down to access the VCS and RMS(Fig. 2C). Even though the CFS approach does notdirectly access the VCS and RMS, it indirectly ap- proaches both compartments via the septum. An Fig. 1.

Unfortunately, theRMS and VCS are small compartments providing onlylimited access and making it nearly impossible to ac-cess the VCS directly because the infraorbital canalblocks direct access via the RMS approach (Fig. 3). 4. Discussion Sinoscopy as both a diagnostic and therapeutic toolcan be performed easily in the standing, sedatedhorse by surgeons and general practitioners. Accu-rate anatomical understanding of normal sinus com-partments is vital to sinoscopic success. As thehorse ages and the maxillary teeth erupt furtherinto the mouth, the teeth take up less space withinthe sinus compartments and compartments enlarge.This makes sinoscopy in an older horse easier andmore rewarding. Sinus disease can distort sinusanatomy making sinoscopy confusing or challengingin certain scenarios. However, if the practitioneridenties the appropriate \"normal\" location of theimportant landmarks used for sinoscopy, diagnosisand therapy can often be achieved.Acknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri-nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

Materials and MethodsEquipment Preparation For a gastroscopy, a 3-m scope is preferred. Insome smaller horses or foals a shorter scope mayallow some visualization. In very large horses, a3-m scope may not be able to examine the duode-num. A short investment of time in preparation ofthe equipment can save valuable time during theexam. Prior to the examination, the scope shouldbe conrmed to be working, the biopsy channelshould be clear, the water channel should be func-tioning and pushing water across the lens. Theauthor uses additional equipment for rapid insuffla-tion of the stomach and for a more powerful waterjet both via the biopsy channel. The scope shouldarticulate in all four directions. If image capture isdesired, the equipment should be turned on and thepatient information programmed into the correctelds.Patient Preparation Once the equipment is set up correctly, the patientshould be prepared for endoscopy. A minimum of 12hours and the author prefers 18 hours of fasting fromhay and feed should have been performed. A mini-mum of 6 hours of fasting from water should have beenperformed. For patients being seen on the farm or asoutpatients, it is very important to discuss fasting andmuzzling with the owners. Additionally, the trans-port must know not to allow any access to hay on thetrailer or grass prior to endoscopy. The patient should be restrained in a manner comfortable for the veterinarian and veterinarystaff. The author sedates all gastroscopy cases andexamines the majority in stocks. Any sedation thatthe veterinarian is comfortable with is appropriate ifthe depth of sedation is deep enough to allow safepassage of the endoscope. Deep sedation may im-pact swallowing and make gastroscopy more dif-cult. The author prefers romidine at 0.04 to 0.05mg/kg. Occasionally a nose twitch or additional de-vice may be necessary to allow safe passage of theendoscope after sedation. Passage of the Endoscope A lubricated scope is introduced into one nostril andpassed to the pharynx. It is then passed into the 50 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO PERFORM ENDOSCOPY IN EQUINE PRACTICE NOTESesophagus as the patient attempts to swallow.Occasionally stimulation of the swallowing reflexneeds to be induced by application of water onto themucosa via the endoscope. If the scope is not stiff,an external tube can be used as a guide through thepharynx. Care should be taken when introducingthe scope to not allow it to retroflex into the oralcavity where it can be damaged. The author willfrequently lock the scope to prevent retroflexion.Alternatively, you can use a dental speculum openedslightly to prevent damage to the endoscope in caseof a retroflexion. Once in the esophagus, additional lubrication can be applied to the scope. This helps to limit anytrauma to the nasal mucosa. The scope is passedquickly down the esophagus and into the stomach.Once past the cardia, the stomach should be insuf-flated. The author has found external air compres-sors such as those used for mattress to be an idealtool to quickly insufflate the stomach. Watch thefolds in the glandular mucosa as a rough gauge ofgastric distension. If they are flattening out, thestomach is nearing maximum dilation. Examination of the Stomach Once the stomach is distended, a global view of thestomach is taken. Are there parasites on the mu-cosa? Is there a food bolus or mass visible? Fromthe cardia, the scope should be directed (make surethe locks are now off) down toward the margo plica-tus (MP). As you advance the scope it will wraparound the stomach. Many times, it will want tospiral up into the saccus caecus before spiralingback down toward the glandular mucosa. If you tryto keep the image on the screen to be just on theglandular side of the MP this spiraling can beavoided. The initial area of the MP seen as youenter the stomach is the greater curvature. As youfollow along the MP you will visualize the scopecoming out of the esophagus and the lesser curva-ture. The scope is then directed below the lessercurvature and into the pylorus. Occasionally thisrequires going into gastric fluid and losing any di-agnostic image for a short period. Occasionallysome air must be introduced to the pylorus to distendit for evaluation. The scope should be advanced intothe antrum to allow for a view of the glandular mu-cosa. Peristalsis is noted as the pyloric sphincteropens and closes. Occasionally bile is seen refluxingback into the stomach. The peristalsis will frequentlypropel the scope deeper into the pylorus and towardthe pyloric sphincter. If the peristalsis does not pro-pel the scope, retracting on the scope frequently will.When the scope is in the pylorus, it has effectivelymade a C shape and pulling out will move the cameradeeper into the pylorus. Examination of the Pylorus As the scope approaches the pyloric sphincter, a 90\u00b0turn must be executed to get into the duodenum.This is done by both directing the scope with thecontrol knobs, and by rotating the handle of thescope externally. Both motions will change the di-rection of the scope tip and allow for introductioninto the duodenum. Once in the duodenum someadjustments are necessary to visualize the lumen.The major duodenal papilla can be visualized andbile secretions should be seen as the duct contracts. Examination of the Esophagus Once the examination of the stomach and duodenumis complete, the scope should be retracted to thecardia. If the stomach is still distended some aircan be removed. This is not always necessary.The scope is then retracted slowly and deliberatelyup the esophagus while also distending with air.This distal esophagus should be evaluated carefullyfor signs of acid reflux. The remainder of theesophagus is examined for damage to the mucosa. Scoring of the Examination Veterinarians should adopt the 0 to 4 scoring system ofthe Equine Gastric Ulcer Council for non-glandularulcers. 1,2It is the only scoring system that has shown repeatability and correlation between examiners.3 Score Squamous Mucosa 0 Epithelium is intact and there is no appearance of hyperkeratosis 1 The mucosa is intact but there are areas of hyperkeratosis 2 Small single or multifocal ulcers3 Large single or extensive supercial lesions4 Extensive lesions with areas of deep ulceration There is no current scoring system for glandular ulcers or esophageal damage and lesions found inthese areas should be described based on numbers,size, shape, and location. 3. Results The author estimates close to 500 gastroscopies per-formed. One horse developed colic post gastroscopyfrom air distension. This horse had a pyloric ste-nosis and the patient became visually bloated dur-ing the examination. The occasional horse willdevelop bleeding from the nasal mucosa caused bytrauma from the scope in the nasal passage. With practice the procedure can be completed in 10 minutes and will require the assistance of 1technician. 4. Discussion Gastroscopy is performed for many different rea-sons. The most common is to try and determine thesource of abdominal pain. Additional reasons toconsider gastroscopy include poor performance, poorappetite, and abnormal or bizarre behavior. In theanorexic horse the classic history is a horse that willeat hay and either not eat grain or eat the grain veryslowly. A feed/fast model is a very common way toinduce gastric ulcers experimentally and cause or AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 51HOW TO PERFORM ENDOSCOPY PRACTICEeffect should be considered when examining ulcersin anorexic horses. Horses that have been held offfeed, or are anorexic for other gastrointestinal rea-sons will have gastric ulcers. Occasionally masses are noted in the stomach. The author has not obtained a diagnostic sampleusing a small endoscopic biopsy via the biopsy chan-nel. If a biopsy is needed, one should consider apolypectomy snare. 4 Gastric ulcers are common in multiple populations of horses. The following populations have been ex-amined and pain(49%). 5-10Understanding how to efciently perform a gastroscopy will allow for identication of the ulcersand follow up of treatment.

Introduction Embryo transfer is a routine procedure performed inequine practice. Embryo transfer is typically per-formed to obtain more than one foal per year, toattain pregnancies from older mares that are unableto carry a foal to term, to acquire a foal from mareswith fertility issues, or to obtain pregnancies frommares in athletic performance. 1-3The basic mech- anisms of equine embryo transfer are well described;however, modications may be required to overcomechallenges in a clinical embryo transfer program.Three of the many issues in equine embryo transferare 1) What media to use for embryo recovery?2) What options are available if a cycling recipient isnot able available for a donor? and 3) Does everyrecipient that ovulates have adequate progesteroneto support pregnancy? The options for embryo recovery fluid can be over- whelming. It is common in the United States toperform embryo-recovery attempts with a commer-cially manufactured media that includes a Zwitte-rion-based buffer, antibiotics, and a surfactant(bovine serum albumin or polyvinyl alcohol). 2,4In many other countries, it is common to use acrystalloid isotonic intravenous fluid (for asurfactant. Lactated Ringer's solution is used ex-tensively for embryo recovery in Argentina andBrazil with reported good embryo recovery and preg-nancy rates. However, there has not been a directhead-to-head comparison for embryo recovery be-tween a complete flush media and a crystalloid iso-tonic fluid. One of the more important factors affecting the likelihood of establishing a pregnancy after embryotransfer is donor-recipient synchrony. Several stud-ies have suggested that adequate pregnancy ratescan be achieved when recipients ovulate 1 day beforethe donor (/H110011) or up to 3 days after the donor(/H110023). 5,6A common issue in an embryo-transfer program is having a large-enough pool of cyclingrecipients early in the season to match the embryo-donor population. When a cycling recipient is un-available to match up with a donor mare, an optionis to administer estrogen for 2 days followed byprogesterone for 5 days to transitional or anestrusrecipient mares. 7-11This hormone-treatment AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 53TOPICS CLINICAL REPRODUCTION NOTESprotocol mimics the normal increase in estrogenprior to ovulation and the progesterone-dominatedphase following ovulation that occurs in a normal-cycling mare. Various groups have used these pro-tocols with success ranging from 40% to 76%. 7,9-11 When an embryo-transfer recipient ovulates, or is started on exogenous progesterone therapy there isa presumption that progesterone values 5 days laterwill be greater than 4 ng/mL. Progesterone is re-sponsible for increased uterine and cervical tonefound in an ideal embryo-transfer recipient mare.Low progesterone levels are associated with de-creased cervical and uterine tone. 12The minimum level of progesterone capable of supporting a preg-nancy has been reported to be approximately 2.5ng/mL. 8 The objectives of this study were to 1) compare embryo recovery rates and pregnancy rates in recip-ients at 14 and 25 days (embryo age) between com-plete flush solution and Hartmann's solution; 2)evaluate pregnancy rates in recipients with a natu-ral ovulation, hormone treatment, or both a naturalovulation and hormone treatment; and 3) determineprogesterone values 5 days post ovulation. 2. Materials and MethodsStudy 1 Embryo recovery was performed on day 7 or 8 afterovulation. An 8-mm internal diameter sterile sili-cone catheter with an inflatable cuff was advancedthrough the cervix, and the cuff was inflated with airand pulled against the internal cervical os. Thecatheter was attached to sterile Y-tubing that con-nected the catheter to the fluid bag and a 75- /H9262m embryo lter. Embryo-recovery procedures wereperformed using either complete flush media aor Hartmann's solutionbon an alternating basis (i.e., every other mare) throughout the 2016 breedingseason. The lter was rinsed with complete flushmedia following embryo-recovery media regardlessof whether complete flush media or Hartmann's so-lution was used. For data analysis, each embryo-recovery attempt was treated as a positive ornegative event, irrespective of the number of ovula-tions or embryos recovered. Embryos were trans-ferred by one of two experienced clinicians intorecipient mares, all mares were maintained on al-trenogest starting at the time of transfer through120 days of pregnancy. Pregnancy exams were per-formed at days 14 and 25 (embryo age). Study 2 Once a donor mare ovulated, a recipient mare wassynchronized using one of the three following treat-ments, 1) natural ovulation: a recipient mare with/H1102235-mm a transi-tional or anestrus mare was administered estrogen(6.6 mg IM) on 2 consecutive days followed by 5 to 7days of short-acting progesterone (200 mg IM), 3)natural ovulation plus hormone treatment: if a recip-ient mare failed to respond to a GnRH agonist within48 hours, the mare was administered human chorionicgonadotropin (hCG) plus short-acting progesterone(200 mg IM) on the same day with short-acting pro-gesterone therapy continuing for 5 to 7 days. Thenatural-ovulation-plus-hormone-treatment groupincluded some cycling mares that were in early es- trus but did not have a follicle that could be inducedwith a GnRH agonist or hCG. The ultimate goal forall the treatment groups was to have recipientmares exposed to estrogen for at least 2 days fol-lowed by 5 to 7 days of progesterone exposure priorto receiving an embryo. Study 3 A blood sample was collected in an ethylenedi-aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vacuum tube forevery recipient mare 5 days after ovulation. Pro-gesterone concentration was determined using anenzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA). Data are presented as mean /H11006standard tion. Statistical analysis for categorical data wascompared using /H92732analysis, continuous data was compared using a Student ttest. A signicant dif- ference was considered if a P/H11021.05 was detected. 3. ResultsStudy 1 A total of 78 embryo-recovery attempts were per-formed with complete flush solution and 77 wereperformed with Hartmann's solution. There wasno statistical difference ( P/H11005.19) in the percentage of positive embryo recovery attempts when compar-ing complete flush media (46.2%; 36 of 78) and Hart-mann's solution (57.1%; 44 of 77; Fig. 1). Whenrecovery of twin embryos were included, a total of 41embryos were recovered using complete flush mediaand 47 embryos were recovered with Hartmann'ssolution. There was no signicant difference inpregnancy rates in recipient mares for embryos re-covered in complete flush media or Hartmann's so-lution at 14 days (80.5%, 33 of 41; vs 80.8%, 38 of 47,respectively) or 25 days (78.0%, 32 of 41; vs 76.6%,36 of 47, respectively) of embryo age (Fig. 1). Study 2 A total of 118 in vivo produced fresh or cool-shipped embryos were transferred, with 14- and 25-day preg-nancy rates of 80% and 76%, respectively. Sixty-ve embryos were transferred into recipients withnatural ovulations, resulting in a 14- and 25-daypregnancy rates of 75% and 69%, respectively (Fig.2). For recipients that were hormone treated, 40embryos were transferred with 14- and 25-day preg-nancy rates of 85% and 83%, respectively (Fig. 2).Fourteen embryos were transferred into recipientmares with a natural ovulation plus hormone 54 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTOPICS IN CLINICAL REPRODUCTIONtherapy with 14 and 25 day pregnancy rates of 86%and 86%, respectively (Fig. 2).

Study 3 A total of 218 recipient cycles were evaluated 5 daysafter ovulation for progesterone concentration witha natural ovulation. The mean progesterone value5 days after ovulation was 9.4 /H110063.7 ng/mL (Table 1). In recipient mares with natural ovulations, 5.5% ofmares (12 of 218) were found to have a progesteronevalue of /H110214.0 ng/mL and 0.9% of mares (2 of 218) had progesterone values of /H110211.0 ng/mL (Table 1).4. Discussion Previous studies have reported good embryo-recov-ery rates using an isotonic crystalloid fluid (i.e.,LRS) 13To the authors' knowledge, there has not been a direct comparison of embryo-recovery ratesat the same facility using commercial complete-flushmedia or a crystalloid fluid. In the current study,no difference in embryo recovery was observed be-tween a commercial complete-flush media and Hart-mann's solution. The use of a surfactant has beensuggested for crystalloid fluids due to the possibility ofan embryo sticking to the catheter, tubing, cup, orsearch dish in the embryo-recovery process. 1,2How- ever, based on the results of the current study using a Fig. 1. Embryo recovery and pregnancy rates following embryo transfer with complete flush media or Hartmann's solution. Therewere no signicant differences in either embryo recovery or pregnancy rates (P /H11022.05). Fig. 2.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 55TOPICS IN CLINICAL REPRODUCTIONnonsurfactant media there was no decrease in embryo-recovery rates. In the current study the lter was rinsed using a surfactant-containing media, complete-flush solu-tion, to minimize the chance of an embryo sticking tothe plastic search dish. The authors elected to usea surfactant-containing media to rinse the lter aspreliminary evaluation of Hartmann's solution re-sulted in one embryo sticking to the bottom of theembryo search dish. This embryo was gently liftedoff the bottom of the dish, washed, and transferred,which subsequently resulted in a pregnancy in therecipient mare. Historically, studies in which embryos were trans- ferred into noncycling or ovariectomized recipientmares had low sample size. 8,14,15Recently, several studies with more than 40 embryos transferredfound no difference in pregnancy rates between hor-mone-treated acyclic recipients and cycling recipientmares. 9-11,The current study also found no differ - ence between hormone-treated noncycling recipientsand recipient mares with a natural ovulation. Es-trogen followed by progesterone administration toacyclic mares can result in a pregnancy rate similarto that associated with a natural ovulation. Unfortunately, mares do not always ovulate after administration of an ovulation-induction agent.Recipient mares with a follicle /H1102235 mm are typically administered a GnRH agonist on the day a donormare ovulates. In the current study, if a recipientmare failed to ovulate, in response to a GnRH ago-nist, the mare was started on 200 mg of progester-one plus administered hCG in an attempt to induceovulation. Injectable progesterone therapy wascontinued until either an embryo was transferred oruntil the recipient was no longer in synchrony witha donor. The goal of this treatment was to create a recipient with a progesterone-dominated periodfor 5 to 7 days prior to receiving an embryo. Thismanagement scheme of hormone treatment plusovulation induction is advantageous when thereare limited numbers of recipient mares availableand allows for a greater efciency in recipientmanagement. Hormone therapy was also used in cycling recipi- ents that were in early estrus (minimal to no uterineedema and /H1102130 mm follicle) in which mares were treated for 2 days with injectable estrogen followedby injectable progesterone administration. Oftenwhen injectable progesterone was bestarted the recipient would have a follicle /H1102235 mmand ovulation could be induced. This situation wasused on four recipient mares in the current studylate in the breeding season, to match up large em-bryo donors with appropriately sized recipients.The use of hormone therapy in cycling mares inearly estrus can help practitioners match up specicrecipients with donor mares; this protocol may beespecially helpful in situations where a client hasone donor and only one recipient mare. Clinicians often assume that when a mare ovu- lates, a normal corpus luteum will form and ade-quate progesterone will be produced. A previousstudy found 3.7% (9 of 242) of the cycles had proges-terone values /H110214.0 ng/mL at 5 days after ovula- tion. 12In the current study, 5% of cycles in which an ovulation was detected had plasma progesterone val-ues/H110214.0 ng/mL and 0.9% of cycles had progesterone concentrations of /H110211.0 ng/mL. These studies suggest that a low percentage of cycles are associated with adysfunctional corpus luteum. In the current study arapid-validated progesterone assay was used and noneof the mares with progesterone values /H110214.0 ng/mL received an embryo. 4. Conclusions Clinicians have many options for embryo-recoveryfluid, with both commercial complete-flush mediaand Hartmann's solution having similar embryo-recovery rates and pregnancy rates in recipientmares. When cycling-recipient mares are in shortsupply, hormone therapy can be used in both acyclicand cycling recipients to prepare the uterus for anembryo with good pregnancy rates. Cliniciansshould be aware that even when an ovulation isdetected, not every developing corpus luteum willsecrete an adequate amount of progesterone (i.e.,/H110224.0 ng/mL). These techniques can allow clini-cians greater flexibility to overcome common chal-lenges in embryo recovery and recipient-maremanagement.

Introduction Availability of semen from many stallions is limitedto collection every 48 hours. Pregnancy rates havebeen reported to be lower in mares bred withshipped semen (SS) vs on-farm insemination (OF)under this schedule. 1This study compares preg- nancy rates in mares bred OF or SS, when freshsemen is available every day vs every other day. 2. Materials and Methods Semen containing /H11350500 million motile spermatozoa from four proven stallions was used to inseminatemares in heat with SS over 344 cycles and maresresiding OF over 73 cycles. OF mares in estrus wereexamined daily by transrectal ultrasound, edema was visualized, and inseminated 24 to 28 hours later. Pregnancy wasdocumented by embryo recovery or ultrasonographicexamination 14 to 18 days postovulation. The /H92732test was used for statistical analysis. 3. Results OF mares had higher ( P/H11021.05) per-cycle pregnancy rates than SS mares (75% vs 63%, respectively)when semen was available on a daily basis for col-lection. When stallions are available for daily collec- tion, pregnancy rates are higher ( P/H11021.05) for mares both on farm and receiving SS than pregnancy re-ported for every-other-day availability of semen collec-tion (75% vs 68% and 63 vs 50%, respectively). 4. Discussion Pregnancy rates are optimized when semen is avail-able on a daily basis.

McCue, DVM, PhD, DACT*; and Ryan A. Ferris, DVM, MS, DACT A majority of ovarian abnormalities can be diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography. In someclinical cases, additional diagnostic tests such as hormone analysis or a karyotype may be indi-cated. Authors' address: Equine Reproduction Laboratory, Department of Clinical Sciences, University, Fort Collins, author. \u00a9 2017 AAEP. 1. Evaluation of the reproductive tract of mares is aroutine part of equine veterinary practice. Under-standing normal and abnormal conditions of theovary is critical for making informed decisions re-garding reproductive management of mares. Thegoal of this written review is to describe commonand less common equine ovarian abnormalities (Ta-ble 1); ultrasound videos of each abnormality will bepresented at the annual convention. Transrectalultrasonography can be used to diagnose a majorityof ovarian issues. 1Additional diagnostic tests of- ten include reproductive history, physical examina-tion, and hormone analysis; occasionally an ovarianbiopsy or a karyotype may be important conrm adiagnosis. 2. Anovulatory Follicles Approximately 4% to 8% of dominant folliclesin a mare in estrus fail to ovulate during the phys-iologic breeding season in mares. A majority of an-ovulatory anovulatory are recognized on ultra-sonographic examination as large static follicularstructures with few to no echogenic particles orstrands within the lumen (Fig. 1). Persistent an-ovulatory follicles are often slow to regress and mayremain for weeks. Affected mares go out dominant follicle. Luteinized Anovulatory Follicles The fate of a dominant follicle of a mare in estrusthat fails to ovulate is usually formation of a tran-sient luteal structure. Approximately 85% of an-ovulatory follicles (i.e., hemorrhagic anovu-latory follicle) initially ofechogenic particles within the follicular lumen (Fig.2). These echogenic spots are likely clumps of redblood cells, brin, or clusters of granulosa cells. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 61TOPICS IN CLINICAL NOTESOccasionally, a large amount of unclotted blood isnoted swirling around during manipulation of theanovulatory follicle (Fig. 3). The delay in clotting ispresumably due to the presence of anticoagulants inequine follicular fluid. A progressive development of echogenic brin strands (Fig. 4) occurs over the next 2 to 3 days witheventual complete inltration of echogenic lutein-ized cells (Fig. 5). Progesterone levels begin to in-crease within 1 to 2 days after initial detection ofechogenic particles in the follicular lumen and com-monly increase to greater than 8 to 10 ng/mL. Ad- ministration of a single dose of prostaglandins willusually result in complete regression of the luteinizedstructure, and seems to be best performed at least 9days after initial detection of echogenic particles. 2. Persistent Corpus Luteum A corpus luteum that fails to regress within 14 to 16days after ovulation in a nonpregnant mare is con-sidered to be pathologically persistent. The mostcommonly recognized causes of a persistent corpusluteum are ovulations late in diestrus, embryonic lossafter the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy,and chronic uterine infections (i.e., pyometra). Inser-tion of a sterile glass ball (i.e., marble) into the uterus,administration of oxytocin during mid-diestrus, andovulation during a course of altrenogest therapy canalso cause persistence of the corpus luteum. 4-7In addition, failure of the endometrium of a nonpregnantmare to secrete prostaglandins during the normal pe-riod of maternal recognition of pregnancy may alsoresult in a persistent corpus luteum. 8 A persistent corpus luteum is indistinguishable on ultrasonographic examination from a normal ma-ture corpus luteum (Fig. 6). Mares with a persis-tent corpus luteum will have good tone in the uterusand cervix, a pale, tight and dry cervix on speculumTable 1.

Premature Luteolysis Premature destruction of the corpus luteum (lute-olysis) is associated with an early onset of estrus anda decrease in the interovulatory interval. Detec-tion of a smaller-than-predicted corpus luteum (Fig.7) in association an early onset of endometrialedema is the clinical hallmark of premature luteoly-sis. The most common cause of premature lute- olysis in the mare is bacterial endometritis, 9-11 which may be associated with the presence ofechogenic fluid within the uterine lumen (Fig. 8).Inflammation of the endometrium can result insufcient synthesis and release of prostaglandinsto cause luteal regression. A combination of uter-ine culture and cytology should be performed in anonpregnant mare to determine whether a uterineinfection is present. 4. Ovarian Tumors Ovarian tumors may arise from the surface epithe-lium, ovarian stroma, or germ cells. The most com-mon ovarian tumor in the mare is the granulosa celltumor (GCT). Other ovarian tumors such as cysta-denomas, teratomas, and dysgerminomas are con-sidered to be rare in the horse. 12 GCTs are almost always unilateral, slow growing, and benign. GCTs are hormonally active and be-havioral abnormalities such as prolonged anestrus,aggressive or stallion-like behavior, and persistentestrus may be expressed in affected mares. 13Diag - nostic techniques used in the detection of an ovariantumor are palpation and ultrasonography and hor-mone analysis. ultrasonographic an equine GCT with a small contralat-eral ovary (Fig. 9). However, a GCT may occa-sionally present as a solid mass or as a single largecyst (Fig. 10). Inactivity in the contralateralovary is due to suppression of pituitary folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) secretion by inhibinand other hormones produced by the tumor. 13 Endocrine tests used to detect or conrm a GCT include measurement of a panel of inhibin, testos-terone and progesterone, or the analysis of Anti-Mu\u00a8llerian hormone. 12,14Inhibin is elevated in approximately 90% of mares with GCT, whereastestosterone is elevated in 40% to 50% of affectedmares and only if there is a thecal cell component tothe tumor (i.e., a granulosa-theca cell tumor). Pro-gesterone is not usually elevated in mares with aGCT. Anti-Mu \u00a8llerian hormone levels in mares with GCTs are signicantly higher than in nonaffected Fig. 4.

Ovarian Hematoma The term ovarian hematoma refers to excessive post-ovulation hemorrhage resulting in ovarian enlarge-ment. An ovarian hematoma has ultrasonographiccharacteristics of an enlarged corpus hemorrhagicum(Fig. 11). Fibrin strands traverse through a pool ofcongealing echogenic fluid as the blood clot beginsto form. Subsequent examinations reveal increasedechogenicity as the process of cellular inltrationand luteinization occurs. Given that ovulation oc-curred prior to formation of the ovarian hematoma,affected mares have the ability to become pregnant.6. Failure of Follicular Development Alterations of follicular development may be associ-ated with a variety of physiological and pathologicalconditions. Ovarian Senescence Ovarian dysfunction has been identied as a cause ofreduced fertility in mares approximately 20 years ofage or older. Ovarian issues in older mares include a longer follicular phase, prolonged interovulatoryperiod, and delay in the rst ovulation of the year. 15 Complete failure of follicular development or ovar-ian senescence has been observed in aged mares andmay be due to an insufcient number of primordialfollicles. An ultrasound examination of a marewith ovarian senescence would reveal an absence offollicular activity (Fig. 12). No effective treatmentsare available for promoting follicular growth in se-nescent ovaries. Postpartum Anestrus A majority of mares develop follicles and ovulateearly in the postpartum period (i.e., foal heat ovula-tion) and continue to cycle if they are not bred or donot become pregnant. However, some mares mayexhibit a temporary failure of follicular developmentor ovulation after foaling. 16Affected mares may remain anestrus or anovulatory for weeks or monthsbefore cyclic ovarian activity is initiated. Maresthat foal early in the year are more prone to exhibitpostpartum anestrus than mares foaling later in thespring or in the summer. \"Postpartum anestrus\"may be caused by the combined effects of season,nutrition, and lactation. Ultrasound examinationof a mare exhibiting re-veal multiple small- to medium-sized follicles (i.e.,15 to 25 mm in diameter), but usually an absence ofendometrial edema (Fig. 13). Exogenous Hormone Treatment Administration of anabolic steroids, dexametha-sone, estradiol esters, and a combination of proges-terone plus estradiol have all been reported to Fig. 8.

GnRH Vaccine Administration Active immunization of mares against of pituitary FSH follicular activity, suppression of estrus, anddecreased fertility that is related to the magnitudeand duration of antibody titer. 21-23In most in - stances, the effect is reversible over time as anti- body titers wane and vaccinated mares eventuallyresume ovarian function and return to normal fer-tility. However, a limited number of mares im-munized against GnRH have been noted to fail tohave recrudescence to cyclicity after severalyears. luteal thatforms after ovulation. Luteal insufciency hasbeen suggested to be a cause of subfertility in mares,although data are limited. 25Clinically, luteal in - sufciency may be noted most commonly 14 to 16days after ovulation in pregnant mares with a smallregressing corpus luteum. The cause of the lutealinsufciency is likely to be failure of maternal rec-ognition of pregnancy. Supplementation with ex-ogenous progestins can successfully maintain thepregnancy in the absence of endogenous progester-one.

Epithelial Inclusion Cysts Cysts within the region of the ovulation fossa oradjacent to the ovary may be observed during surface epithelium that lines the ovulationfossa that becomes embedded within the ovariancortex following ovulation. Epithelial inclusioncysts may interfere with fertility if they obstruct theovulation fossa and are more common in oldermares. Ultrasonographically, epithelial inclusioncysts are identied as a cluster of small cysts lledwith clear (nonechogenic) fluid in the center of theovary in the region of the ovulation fossa (Fig. 15).No treatment is necessary or warranted. 9. generally interfere withovulation or oocyte transport, respectively, and arenot usually associated with reduced fertility. 27 Parovarian cysts can be small ( /H1102110 mm) to large (/H1102230 mm) fluid-lled structures adjacent to theovary (Fig. 16). Parovarian cysts may be inadver-tently mistaken ovarian follicle. tion between a parovarian cyst and an ovarian often made by manual palpation per rectum. 10. Chromosomal Abnormalities A chromosomal abnormality may be suspected in amare of breeding age with primary infertility andgonadal hypoplasia. 28The most commonly re - the horse is 63,X gonadal dysgenesis, in which only a single sexchromosome is present.

Are there things we aspracticing veterinarians do that further support the hidden curriculum that begins to be taught inveterinary school? This paper will examine the concept of the hidden curriculum and apply thisconcept to the private practice setting in order that equine practitioners can better understand itsimplications for overall wellness in the profession. The paper will serve as an outline to stimulatediscussion during the convention meeting. Author's AAEP. 1. Introduction The hidden curriculum is an informal set ofnorms, practices, or values that are taught andmodeled to students. It is dened as \"the unwrit-ten, unofcial, and often unintended lessons, val-ues, and perspectives that students learn inschool.\" It is outside the objectives outlined in formal course syllabi. 1The hidden curriculum can either offer support to the information taughtwithin the formal curriculum or it can underminethese lessons. It is this collision between eithersupport for and/or undermining of the curriculumthat needs to be considered. What are we teachingour equine interested students about the practice ofequine medicine and surgery? Are the things weare teaching via the hidden curriculum positive ornegative and do they support the development ofhealthy equine practitioners? Specically, agreement about whether a hidden curriculum exists should be examined. If yes, adenition for the curriculum taught in the equinesections of veterinary school across the UnitedStates should be examined. In the context of aneducational environment like veterinary school, theconcept of a hidden curriculum makes sense becausethe purpose of an educational institution is to teach.Thus, within this context it seems reasonable thatunintended lessons may be transmitted to studentsfrom faculty members along with the more formalcurriculum. Often, these unwritten lessons are notpositive. In her article written for the New York Times in 2009, Dr. Paula Chen wrote about the hidden cur-riculum in human medical education. While most of medical education and training isabout the nuts and bolts of clinical care\u2014how totreat hypertension, how to manage a ventilator,how to take out a gallbladder\u2014the process alsoinvolves learning how to be \"a doctor.\" As op-posed to lessons covered in textbooks and class-rooms, this kind of learning is done throughmodeling, or what medical sociologist F. W. Haf-ferty has called the \"informal\" or \"hiddencurriculum.\" /H114082017 69LIFESTYLE/WELLNESS: BALANCING WORK/PERSONAL LIFE NOTESMedical students and residents copy the lingo, manners, and expressions of more establishedsenior residents and attending physicians. Thelessons from these role models, who are oftentired and stressed out themselves, can be sober-ing. They are also often cynical, rooted in largepart in the belief that a doctor's level of compas-sion is xed. 2 As Dr. Chen points out, it is often the hidden curriculum that teaches us how to \"be doctors\" andtherefore plays a big role in dening the culture ofpractice. To change what it means to be a doctor,we must acknowledge the underlying hiddencurriculum. 2. What Is the Hidden Curriculum in Equine Practice? The idea of a \"hidden curriculum\" in equine practiceis of great interest to the author as much of hercareer has been spent trying to increase the veteri-nary profession's capacity for understanding leader-ship and wellness and how, when these two conceptsare successfully tied together, they lead to careerfulllment. This pursuit has resulted in learningabout what it means to be an equine practitioner byvisiting over three quarters of the nation's veteri-nary schools, having hundreds of conversations withpractice owners, associates, technicians, and sup-port staff, engaging numerous American Associationof Equine Practitioners members through variousleadership events, and learning through the au-thor's own experience in equine practice. Throughthese experiences and conversations, the samepoints come up over and over again. Namely, thatwe, as equine practitioners, say we want to lead andbe well, but that our actions do not line up with whatwe say. Often, students comment on this doublestandard in their courses and labs. For example, itis not uncommon for faculty members to talk aboutthe importance of life balance with their studentswhile working 60 /H11001hours a week themselves and expecting students to do the same. New associateswho were hopeful the double standard would changeonce they got into practice are discouraged whenthey realize it remains the same in practice. Fromveterinary school into practice, the old adage, \"Do asI say, not as I do,\" is common. The research is beginning to document that in order to lead effectively, one must be well. 3If this is true, what are our veterinary schools doing tofoster the skills associated with wellness and lead-ership in equine practice? What are practice own-ers doing to exactly isthe \"hidden curriculum\" within equine educationand practice? Through discussion with numerous program par- ticipants at state and national meetings and conver-sations with students and practitioners, thefollowing ideas have been presented as componentsof the hidden curriculum of equine practice:Long hours at work are necessary and reasonable. Taking time for yourself is unnecessary. Emotions have no place at work. Asking for help is for people who are weak and unorganized. Negative reinforcement is a necessary compo- nent of medical training. Doctors never make mistakes and, in the rare case that they do, talking about the mistake isnot appropriate. 3. Strategies for Acknowledging the HiddenCurriculum In January of 2009, a study was published in Aca- demic Medicine about how we can begin to shift the culture of medicine and address the negative lessonsphysicians learn through the hidden curriculum.Through faculty development, clinicians can begiven the skill sets necessary to foster a positiveapproach to teaching. 4Dr. Chen writes about that study, \"A new study published in this month's issueof Academic Medicine proves that effort does matter,and that learning is possible. Even established cli-nicians can be re-inspired to adopt new humanisticskills, becoming better teachers and role models inthe process.\" 3Discussion about these ideas will lead to a better understanding of their merit and possiblestrategies to combat the negative consequences ofthese hidden lessons that are being taught. Moreresearch is needed to further dene how the hiddencurriculum is affecting equine practitioners, but inthe meantime, we can begin to shift the culture ofequine practice toward one that supports leadershipdevelopment and wellbeing by having open and hon-est conversations about the double standard thatcurrently exists in our veterinary schools as well asin practice.

Introduction Published studies, nationally and internationally,consistently report that veterinarians are at higherrisk for mental and addictive ill health versus thegeneral population. The statistics are alarming;they document a reality within our profession thatmust spur us to action\u2014both in our own lives and inthe context of our larger profession. Male and female veterinarians have a relative risk 5.62 times and 7.62 times, respectively,higher than the general population for deathscertied as suicide. 1 Repeatedly studies show higher percentages of veterinarians reporting characteristics consis-tent with anxiety disorders and depressioncompared with the general population. 2 A study from the United Kingdom screened veterinarians for \"at-risk drinking\" reporting62.5% of those screened were positive. 1 Anecdotal evidence highlights an increased use of narcotics among veterinarians, asreported by Physician Health Programsnationally. 3 Conversely, there is evidence of a disconnect be-tween a veterinarian's self-perceived risk for mentaland physical ill health and published statistics ofthe actual risks. There are wide discrepancies inthe percentage of veterinarians who report mental,physical, and addictive illness and those seekingtreatment. 4Many veterinarians are not aware of what resources are available to them for mental oraddictive health issues. Many veterinarians do notidentify issues of mental health, addiction or well-being, in the context of their work lives, or identifythem as issues of relevance for the profession. 2. Emotional Quotient The veterinary profession has historically placedvalue on and rewarded intelligence and scienticrigor. Our profession values Intellectual Quotient(IQ); the value of science, knowledge, and cognitiveability. In addition, our profession values businesssuccess, prot, and practice growth. EmotionalQuotient (EQ) is a measure of self awareness, em-pathy, and sensitivity; it is a measure of \"emotionalintelligence.\" Historically our profession has notplaced value on EQ in our education, training, or inpractices. PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 71LIFESTYLE/WELLNESS: BALANCING WORK/PERSONAL LIFE NOTESAs a profession, and as individuals, we do our- selves a disservice by focusing on IQ to the exclusionof EQ; a veterinarian's mental and physical wellbe-ing relies upon a robust EQ. EQ affects our ability to lead, motivate, and excel at work. EQ affects our ability to manage stress. Stress left unchecked, can contribute to many health problems such as heart disease, obe-sity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. EQ affects our ability to manage anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression directlyaffect our mental health and addictivebehaviors. 5 EQ affects our ability to understand and expressfeelings. This ability is a component to commu-nicating well with others and forging strongrelationships. 5 3. Self Awareness Self awareness is one of the four key componentsof EQ. The other key components of EQ\u2014selfmanagement, social awareness, and relationshipmanagement\u2014build off of self awareness. Selfawareness is a logical \"starting point\" to develop-ing a robust EQ. Self awareness is the ability to recognize our strengths and our weaknesses. Awareness of ourstrengths allows us to fully utilize the best parts ofourselves, to marshal those strengths for our bestchance at success. Awareness of our weaknessesgives us the opportunity to improve and the oppor-tunity to minimize our weaknesses, which maysabotage success. Awareness of ourselves and un-derstanding how others perceive us is important inearning their trust. Self awareness must involve a decision to want to be more curious about Self. Becoming selfaware is a process of better understanding your-self, and should not be negatively focused on judg- ment. What makes you tick? What do you \"need?\"What do you bring to the table? Who are you andwho do others think you are? Becoming self aware isa process that involves gathering feedback from within(self assessment) and from others. There are toolsto help organize the process for becoming more selfaware. 4. Tools Meyer Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).6The MBTI was originally developed in the 1940s byKatharine Cooks Briggs and her daughter, Is-abel Briggs Meyers, with inspiration from thetheories of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. TheMBTI assessment tool identies a person asone of 16 different personality types. Thegoal in identifying your personality type is toachieve a greater understanding of yourselfand yourself in relation to others. There arefour dimensions at the heart of MBTI: /H18546Where you focus your attention /H18546How you take in your information /H18546How you make decisions /H18546How you orientate yourself in the world Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Consci- entiousness (DiSC). 7The DiSC self-assessment tool is a nonjudgmental method providing a com-mon language to better understand yourself,your behaviors, and how you can adapt yourbehaviors with others. In 1956, a psychologist, Walter Clarke, was the rst to build this tool, building on the theories of psychologist, Dr. William Moulton Marston. Similarto MBTI, the premise is to increase self knowledgebut by identifying an individual's compositionof four different \"styles:\" and conscientiousness. The the you to conflict /H18546What motivates you /H18546What stresses you /H18546Problem-solving style DiSC and MBTI are just two well-known self- assessment tools that help create self awareness.There are other tools for becoming self aware thatare more \"organic;\" they don't involve the \"test-taking\" approach of the MBTI or DiSC tools. Selfawareness doesn't start and end with a personalitydesignation from a tool, but rather is an ongoingprocess requiring commitment, time, and practice.Tools, or practices, that reflect the ongoing process ofself-awareness include the following: Mindfulness practice Yoga Meditation/religion/prayer \"Forest bathing\" aimed at immersion in the natural environment through the smells,textures, tastes, and sights of the forest toprovide a physical and mental stress reduc-tion strategy. 8 \"The ultimate value of life depends upon awarenessand the power of contemplation.\" /H11011Aristotle Acknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Vet-erinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest. 72 /H11408Vol. /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLIFESTYLE/WELLNESS: BALANCING WORK/PERSONAL LIFEReferences 1.

Thissession will review common inventory terms and techniques to help you better manage your practice'sinventory and improve your bottom line. Author's address: 7601 \u00a9 2017 AAEP. 1. Introduction In most, if not all, veterinary practices, inventoryis the one of the largest expenses, second only tostafng costs. Lack of proper inventory controlcan result in poor cash flow and loss of protabil- ity. Because of this, it is important that team mem-bers practice scal responsibility when orderingsupplies and stocking the hospital. The goal of thissession is to introduce to you the basics of inventorymanagement, as well as common key inventoryterms, to help you better understand and streamlineyour inventory. As a practice manager, technicianor inventory manager, this is a way for you to havea positive effect on your practice's nancials andhelp the protability of your hospital. What exactly is inventory? Inventory is dened as all goods owned and held for sale or use in theregular course of business. 1This includes your prescription medications, diets and preventatives,as well as your medical supplies such as gauze,suture, syringes, needles, injectables, etc. It doesnot include medical equipment (even small medicaldevices) or ofce supplies. Inventory may bemanaged by a doctor, a practice manager, or anemployee who has been designated the inventorymanager. Although other team members mayhelp in the ordering or receiving process, thereshould be one person ultimately responsible foroversight and training of the practice's inventorymanagement. Many times, we only take into account the actual cost of the products we order, but there are many costspertaining to inventory other than the outright costs ofthe product. One type of additional costs are calledholding costs and often account for an additional 8-15% of the unit cost. 2These costs can include any pharmacy licensing fees, sales and use taxes, buildingand storage costs, and insurance premiums to protectthe inventory and costs resulting from loss and expi-ration. Holding costs also take into account the op-portunity costs of money spent tied up in inventorysitting on the shelf that could be used in other ways.Ordering costs must also be considered. These costs can account for 15-20% of unit costs, and are mainlycomposed of labor costs. The labor costs involved ininventory management might include time spent cu-rating an order, placing the order, meeting with ven-dors, searching for the best prices, receiving an order,ling paperwork, and associated computer work.Both ordering costs and holding costs can be mini-mized by developing a streamlined ordering processwith appropriate ordering quantities. So how do we limit holding and ordering costs? We rst need to determine what is an appropriate 74 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT FOR REVENUE GENERATION NOTESamount of inventory to have on hand. When deter-mining appropriate stocking levels, we need to con-sider reorder points, reorder quantities, par levelsand lead times. A reorder point is the inventorylevel that triggers a reorder of a specic item. Areorder quantity will tell us how much needs to beordered. A par level is the optimal amount of some-thing that we want to have on the shelf, and if ourstock levels dip below that, we order up to it. Leadtime is considered the amount of time that it takesto receive an item once the order is placed. If wewant to only order once a week, we want to take thatinto consideration when determining lead time foran item. Luckily, many of our vendors offer deliv-ery within 2-3 days, with many offering next daydelivery, which can help us dramatically reduce theamount needed to keep in stock at one time. To determine your reorder point for a given item, you want to forecast how much inventory you willuse before your next order. This is so you do notrun out of the item while you are waiting for the neworder to arrive. Your practice management soft-ware is a great resource for this. You can run areport to see how much of each item was sold in aspecic timeframe, and divide that amount by thenumber of days you were open. This is your aver-age daily usage. You can multiply your averagedaily usage by your lead time to determine yourreorder point. Also, consider rounding up or add-ing a few extra days to your lead time for popularproducts to give yourself a little extra protectionfrom stock outs. Your reorder quantity will vary by product. It is ideal to have no more than 30 days' supply of an itemon your shelf at one time. If your goal is to order anitem once a month, your reorder quantity will be theamount you sell, on average, within a 30-day period.If you order weekly, you might also have items thatyou are only ordering a 1-2-week supply at a time.Sometimes we are limited by product packaging.For instance, many common medications come in1000-count bottles. That may last us more than 30days, but purchasing in that quantity can be moreeconomical than ordering smaller-quantity bottles.In the next session, we will discuss how to determinethese gures and put it all together to create anefcient inventory system. Another helpful inventory term is turnover. An inventory turn, or turnover, is the number of timesthat an item is used and replaced during the year.Some items will have a lower turnover than otheritems, but a good rule of thumb is approximatelynine turnovers per year of your entire inventory.The higher your turnover number in a given period,the more efcient inventory. Be cautious about try-ing to get this number too high; there are orderingcosts every time you place an order. The higheryour inventory turn, the lower your amount of in-ventory, which takes vigilance to avoid stock outs.With time, you will nd the right balance of howoften to order and the costs involved.Determining your inventory turnover is a two- step process. First you will need to determine youraverage inventory, then you will use that to helpdetermine your turnovers. See equations below forexamples. You can use your turnover number togauge how you are improving your inventory ef-ciency by calculating it at regular intervals.Average inventory on hand /H11005(beginning inventory /H11001ending inventory)/2 Inventory turns /H11005total purchases in inventory period/average inventory In addition to ordering efciencies, you will alsoneed to think about the nancial side of your inven-tory practices, including pricing. Practices oftenchoose to price items based on either a markup ormargin philosophy. Margin is the difference in thecost and a selling price of an item. When usingmargin pricing, you will want to consider all costsinvolved, including holding and ordering costs, over-head, doctor commissions, and desired prot. An-other pricing philosophy is markup, in which theprice is set based on a percentage of the cost. Forexample, a 200% markup is three times the unit cost(200% of the product cost is added to the cost of theproduct). Many practices use a combination ofpractice philosophies to make their pharmacy suc-cessful. Some items will have smaller margins ormarkups and be considered \"loss leaders\" and besubsidized by other items in your pharmacy with ahigher margin or markup. One of the most difcult, but most important, tool in efciently managing your inventory is alignmentand buy in from your doctors and your team. Get-ting your doctors in alignment on a majority of yourproducts will help you consolidate your inventoryand have fewer items to order. With fewer items toorder, you will be able to have more of one item onthe shelf without fear of stocking out. The chal-lenge here is that doctors often come to us withproduct preferences based on what they learned inschool or used at their previous practice, and they donot want to be told what they have to use. All ofwhich is understandable. Product selection shouldalways be a discussion with the doctor team to en-sure that everyone is onboard with the decision.If you nd that you have a serial problem in yourpractice of having multiple items that serve thesame purpose, start small. Do not start with forc-ing your doctors down to one, or even two, products.Make it a goal to eliminate one or two of those items,starting with the least used ones. These items canbe special orders or moved to an online pharmacy. An online pharmacy is another great tool that can benet your practice, particularly if you perform alot of house calls or farm calls. There are severalgreat options out there. An online pharmacy can belinked to your website so that clients can go to your AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 75THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT FOR REVENUE GENERATIONwebsite and order products that come from yourhospital's online pharmacy, which is stocked by ac-credited pharmacies that work with our regular ven-dors to help us better serve our clients. What thismeans for us is that we do not have to carry everyitem available to better serve our clients, becausethey can get the products from our online pharmacyand we still earn a small prot off the items. An-other benet of an online pharmacy is that if we areseeing the patient outside of the ofce, we still havea pharmacy at our ngertips. One nal thing to remember is to keep it simple. Find a distributor that works for you based on pric-ing, service, and product offerings, and order a ma-jority, if not all, of your supplies through them.Shopping around every week for the best price endsup costing you more in the long run due to increasedordering costs. Although there are a lot of detailsand numbers involved in inventory management,do not over complicate the process. Simplicityand structure are key to making inventory manage-ment something everyone in your practice can takepart in. And when everyone buys in, you will besuccessful!

Thissession will give you direction on how to create aninventory system that helps bring order to the chaosand maximize your protability. Does your inventory drive you crazy? How often do you run out of something you need or see some-thing sitting on the shelf that has not moved inmonths? An inventory system can help! Creatingan inventory system can be a time-consuming andtedious process but in order to control the chaos thatis your inventory, it is very necessary. This sessionwill review the steps to take to design an inventorysystem for your practice as well as offer a few op-tions that will make ordering easier for you. The rst step in creating an inventory system is to decide what items you are going to stock. This maynot be as easy as it sounds. If you do not have asystem already in place you cannot assume thatbecause it is on your shelf that you are going tocontinue ordering it. Before you move forward, youmust have a conversation with ALL of the doctors atyour practice and determine which items you willstock. In some cases it will be obvious because youonly have one or two options, whereas in others youmay nd that you have seven different items thatserve the same purpose. If you nd items in thelatter situation, come to the meeting prepared.Perform a search in your practice management soft-ware (PIMS) to determine how much you are actu-ally selling of each of the items and propose toeliminate the bottom two products from your in-house stock. You may eventually whittle thatdown more, but it is okay to start small to allow thedoctors and team time to acclimate, if necessary. Once you have your list of items that will be stocked, it is time to nd sales history on theseitems. Your PIMS should have reports with thatinformation, or you can also receive that informationfrom your vendors. Use caution in relying on yourpurchase information at this time. If you have nothad a streamlined process, it is possible that yourpurchases may not be equal to your sales, whichcould give you incorrect information. You will usethis information to determine your reorder pointsand reorder quantities. Because preferences canfluctuate, I like to use the previous 3 months of salesinformation to determine my reorder points and re-order quantities. Some people use the previous 12months to get a broader view of the item. To determine a reorder point, you want to take the sales from the time period you select and divide that bythe number of business days in that time period.This will be your daily average usage. Multiply thatnumber by your days of lead time (which will includethe days until your next order), and you will determineyour reorder point. You can use this same informa-tion to determine your reorder quantities by taking your daily usage and multiplying by the shelf life you want theitem to have (generally no longer than 30 days). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 77THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT FOR REVENUE GENERATION NOTESAt this point, you have a few different options. You will rst need to determine whether you want to man-age your inventory in your PIMS or manually. If youare manually managing your inventory, you will needto create a spreadsheet, update it with every item youstock, update your reorder points and reorder quanti-ties, and do a manual count every week when youorder. Table 1 shows an example of what that might look like. This may work for smaller practices. For larger practices, this is a time-consuming event to performevery week. For better efciency in larger prac-tices, most PIMS allow for inventory managementand control within the system. In this case, youwill need to enter all of the reorder quantities andreorder points for each item into the appropriatearea. You will also need to create purchase ordersand receive them when the inventory is received intothe hospital. Each PIMS is different, so if you areunsure of how to do this in your system, reach out toyour software support for direction. Now, insteadof counting each week, you will be able to run a reportout of your system that alerts you when it is time toreorder. This report is called a reorder report, and inmost systems it will list the item, how much is onhand, and what the reorder amount is. Because theinformation is only as good as what we put into it, youwill still need to perform random spot checks, espe-cially on high-demand items, to make sure your countsare accurate. It will be important to have your countsaccurate in the computer so that your reorder infor-mation is accurate. Some PIMS also allow you to setup locations where the product is coming from, so ifyou have one item in multiple areas, you can deduct itfrom the correct location. This can be helpful if youhave multiple departments or mobile kits. Another option is a tag or flag system. In this sys- tem, items are \"tagged\" with a card at a determinedreorder point. This card has vendor information andreorder amounts, so that the inventory managerknows what needs to be reordered and how much.This system is a little simpler, but does have a fewdrawbacks. For one, you have to be certain that thetag will make it to where it needs to go! When we arebusy, sometimes things do not make it where theyneed to be (stuff goes home in my pockets all the time).Also, it can also force higher reorder points, makingyou keep more on the shelf than really necessary.If your reorder point is 200 pills in a 1000-count bottle,there is not an easy way to \"tag\" 200 pills. You wouldlikely reorder a bottle when one is depleted, alwayshaving an unopened bottle on hand. However, thissystem can work well for hospital supplies such asgauze, syringes, fluids, etc. One of the most common manual inventory man- agement system is the want list. This has benetsof being easy for everyone to access and can help theinventory manager spend less time determiningwhat to purchase. However, the drawback of this isthat it does not have any sort of structure aroundhow much to order and when. While the easiest, itcan also be the least effective with regard to prot-ability and inventory management. In very large practices, you have the option of using a central supply concept in your inventorymanagement. In the central supply concept, a ma-jority of your inventory is kept in a locked centralsupply room, with only what is needed during theday being rationed out in other areas of the hospital.Benets of this system include less potential for theft and waste, and a more efcient ordering system.The hospital areas would be stocked from the centralsupply area and the orders are placed based on theinventory levels of the central supply. By limitingaccess to a majority of your inventory, you are alsoprotecting your practice from theft. Also, any dis-crepancies in counts can be determined more quicklyand updated to keep electronic records current. Regardless of the system that you choose, it is a wise decision to separate out the tasks involved ininventory management. For instance, a greatchecks and balances system is to have separate peo-ple place the order, put away the order, and receive theorder into your software (if you are using electronictracking). There should be an additional person whopays the invoices. This will limit any possibility oftheft, diversion, or false orders. Although this can bechallenging in smaller practices, it can work if you getyour entire team involved in the process. Inventory management can be a time-consuming task, but by following a streamlined process, it can become efcient and less chaotic. As inventory man-agers, it is our duty to properly manage what is one ofour practice's largest assets. It takes a great deal ofpreparation to initially get set up, but will pay divi-dends in time and protability once it is in place.

Hyracotherium,examples of whose skeletons can be seen in theKentucky Horse Park Museum and in the NationalHistory Museum in London, browsed on a soft leafyvegetation diet and had brachydont (short crowned) teeth similar to human or canine teeth that copedadequately with this diet. Hyracotherium had adental pattern consisting of three incisors, one ca-nine, four premolar, and three molar teeth in eachquadrant (similar to the mandibular dentition of adog). 2These four classes of teeth had different morphology and function (termed heterodonty ). Great climatic changes at that time, including anincrease in atmospheric CO 2, favoured the growth of more brous plants such as tundra grasses thatreplaced the previous more lush vegetation contain-ing more simple carbohydrates (such as starches)and proteins. These more brous plants containedhigher amounts of complex structural carbohydratessuch as cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin intheir cell walls. Subsequently, over the followingmillions of years, the digestive system, including theteeth, of Hyracotherium and its successors adaptedin response to these dietary changes. Cellulose is a complex carbohydrate composed of chains of d-glucose molecules attached by glycosidicbonds. It is the most common organic compound onearth, and thus the most common potential food-stuff. Astonishingly, no mammals have the diges-tive enzyme (cellulase) to enable them to utilise thiswidespread foodstuff, although some of the simplestof single-cell organisms such as bacteria and fungipossess these enzymes. Consequently, a major evo-lutionary step for the horse was to develop a greatincrease in the size of its large intestines (bothcaecum and colon), which together became a largefermentation vat for microbes that could digestcellulose-containing foodstuffs, in a symbiotic re-lationship with the horse. Subsequent to the mi-crobial digestion of cellulose, the horse derives nutrition from volatile fatty acids produced from itsmicrobial digestion and additionally from the break-down products of these same microbes, when they die. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 79FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURE NOTESA similar evolutionary development in ruminant's foreguts occurred approximately 20 million yearslater. However, unlike ruminants that later regurgi-tate and remasticate brous food at their leisure,horses have only a single opportunity to masticatetheir food into suitable sized particles for both endog-enous (simple, noncellulose foodstuffs) and microbialcellulose digestion and this is one reason why equine digestion of cellulose is 30% less efcient than that ofruminants. 3 An additional development in horses from Hyra- cotherium to the modern horse (Equus caballus) wasa large increase in body size. Intermediate stagesincluded Parahippus followed by a large increase insize occurring with Hipparion between 10 and 15million years ago and later Merychippus and Plio-hippus before the modern horse, Equus. 2,3 This increasingly sized horse would, like all her- bivores, have been preyed upon by the large carni-vores who lived at that time. The horse does nothave the physical defense mechanisms against pred-ators that some other species have, such as horns,claws, or large defensive teeth. However, it devel-oped rapid acceleration and great speed to escape itspredators, traits that we still utilize, especially insport horses. The downside of this instant flightresponse is that when frightened, a horse does notusually consider the level of potential threat, be itanother aggressive animal or a plastic bag flappingon a fence, it just runs! The severe wire injuriesthat horses sustain in comparison with other herbi-vore species that share the same paddocks, or jawand incisor fractures with those sharing similarbarn environments is a testament to this primitivereflex that saved their lives during their evolution,but now can be harmful. Foaling mares and neo-natal foals would have been susceptible to predationand thus mares have a quick, very forceful parturi-tion that can lead to a ruptured bladder in the foaland urogenital lacerations and bladder rupture inthe mare, and fractured ribs are commonplace inneonatal foals. Primitive horses occupied all of the Americas and then migrated to the \"Old World\" by the Bering LandBridge that then connected modern-day Alaska withRussia on a number of occasions, their last migra-tion being 2.5 million years ago. 2These equidae became widely distributed in Asia where the Przew- alski horse (66 chromosomes vs 64 in domesticated horses) developed much later, and to Eastern Eu-rope where another primitive horse, the Tarpan, later evolved. Unfortunately, due to human ne-glect, the Tarpan was allowed to die out less than100 years ago. Primitive horses also migrated on-ward to Africa where the Zebra evolved; the MiddleEast, where the ancestors of Arabian and Thorough-bred horses evolved; and Northern Europe, wherethe ancestors of Cold-Blooded horses such as Ex-moor ponies and draught horses developed. During the last ice age (circa 10,000 to 12,000 years ago) all equids died out in North and SouthAmerica (\"The New World\") where they had origi-nally evolved. Horses were totally absent from thiscontinent for over 10,000 years until reintroduced bythe Spaniards circa 500 years ago. The current\"wild\" (more correctly termed feral) horses in North America (Mustangs) are descendants of these rela-tively recent imports. The Przewalski horse, nativeto Mongolia, is the only true remaining wild horse. Evolution of Equine Teeth A consequence of the change in diet from eatingnutritious, simple foodstuffs, for perhaps a fewhours a day, to browsing a low-calorie, brous dietthat also contained many very hard particles ofplant silicates termed phytoliths, and possible con- tamination with silicate-containing soil, for up to 18hours/day, was that the existing short-crowned(brachydont) teeth would wear out quickly. Someother species adapted to such abrasive diets by rap-idly replacing their teeth, for example, prior to theevolution of horses, Diplodocus, a 100 foot-long di-nosaur, changed its teeth every 5 weeks, utilising arapid turnover of teeth rather than evolving teeththat were adapted to its abrasive diet! The teeth of these early equids developed multiple evolutionary adaptations to cope with this majordietary change. These adaptive dental changes in-cluded an increase in tooth length (hypsodonty)t ocope with the prolonged mastication (Figs. 1 and 2)and thus increased wear caused by the abrasive diet.There was simultaneous deepening of the jaws toaccommodate these longer teeth. 2They also devel - oped prolonged (throughout most of their life) dentaleruption (that differs from the continuous growth of teeth throughout life that occurs in rodents, i.e.,anelodont teeth) to compensate for the above-notedhigh level of dental wear. Consequently, unlikebrachydont teeth where only the roots lie beneaththe gingiva, with all of the crown exposed in the oralcavity, horses evolved teeth with most of the crown Fig. 1. Diagram depicting the evolution of hypsodont teeth. The diagram on the left shows a brachydont tooth with its clinical crown covered in enamel (brown) and all cement (cementum)(blue) lying subocclusally. The middle image shows cementumnow covering the clinical crown. The right image shows the crown,that is now fully covered in enamel and cementum (a primaryhypsodont occlusal STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURElying subgingivally in a young horse as reserve crown, with the shorter erupted orclinical crown exposed in the oral cavity. A further change (likefor many other herbivore teeth) was that equineteeth became less rounded/oval in shape with equinemaxillary cheek teeth becoming squarer and widerthan their rectangular-shaped mandibular cheekteeth. 2 During its relatively rapid transit (1 to 3 days depending on particle size) of food through the equidintestines, 4microbes require a large surface area on the dietary cellulose to effectively digest it. Con-sequently, cellulose needs to be masticated intosmall particles for optimal endogenous and micro-bial digestion. To more effectively grind its food, afurther equid dental adaptation was that the distri-bution of the three calcied tissues in its teeth alsochanged. These latter changes included develop-ment of infolding of the original layer of enamelaround the periphery of the tooth (that still occurs inthe crowns of brachydont teeth). This adaptationgave additional lengths of protruding (hard) enamelridges because enamel, the hardest dental tissue,wears less than the adjacent dentine and cementumon the occlusal surface. These longer, protrudingenamel ridges allow more effective shearing of -brous food material between the occlusal enamelfolds of the opposite teeth. This peripheral enamel infolding is most marked in equid mandibular cheek teeth. 5However, the maxillary cheek teeth that less enamel infold-ing, developed two cup-like infoldings of occlusalenamel (i.e., infundibulae) that extend almost 100%of crown length in young horses, to less than 10% inolder horses, 6that give additional lengths of pro - occlusal enamel folds. The incisors devel-oped a single infundibulum that extended less than20% of the crown length, and so incisor infundibulaewear out in young adult horses. In contrast, cheekteeth infundibulae last almost until the teeth arefully worn, variably until 20 to 30 years of age inhorses (later in donkeys). 5The enamel-free central areas of aged maxillary cheek teeth with worn in-fundibulae become excessively worn, that is termedsenile excavation . The more apical aspects of man- dibular cheek teeth reserve crowns have minimalperipheral enamel infolding and thus older equidaealso develop senile excavation of their mandibularcheek teeth. 5,7 Another evolutionary change was that the more standard dental pattern of four premolars and threemolars changed, with the rst premolar becomingvestigial or (\"wolf tooth\"). Of interest is thatin tapirs, another perisssodactyl (along with therhinocerous), and so a relative of horses, the rstpremolar remains as a full-sized premolar. The re-maining equine three premolars increased in to the molars, i.e., a processtermed molarisation of premolars, with loss of their anatomical and functional differences (het-erodonty). 2As noted above, Triadan 06-08 (pre - molars) and the three molars (Triadan 09 to 11)are collectively referred to as cheek teeth . Brachydont teeth, which form a continuous arch in some species, are kept in tight contact with eachother by the rostrally, (in brachydont dentistrytermed mesial, i.e., toward the median line) directed forces of the last molar (\"wisdom tooth\") 8and also by rostrally directed pressure from normal occlusalforces during mastication. Having tight interden-tal (interproximal) contact between the occlusal as-pects of teeth is even more important for herbivoresthat browse and masticate for up to 18 hours/day.In addition, horses produce enormous masticatory Fig. 2. With further elongation, the teeth are now hypsodont. At eruption the clinical crown is fully covered in enamel withoverlying cementum, i.e., is a primary hypsodont surface (image of the primary surface of a neonatal mandibular cheek teeth on theleft). Once the teeth come to wear, the cementum and enamel on the occlusal surface are quickly worn away exposing the enamelridges on the permanent hypsodont occlusal surface (image of mature mandibular cheek teeth on right). This permanent surface hasenamel folds protruding between the softer cementum and dentine, in a self-sharpening mechanism. Newtons between their caudalcheek teeth). 9These high occlusal pressures force food into any potential spaces between the teeth,even into narrow spaces that are only intermittentlycreated during the normal movement between indi-vidual adjacent teeth during mastication. Thesenormal teeth movements in the latero-medial planecause wear at the interproximal (interdental) con-tact areas and usually fully removes the peripheralcementum at these sites. In horses, the most cau-dal (Triadan 11 and to a lesser degree the Triadan10) clinical crowns are angled rostrally (their re-serve crowns are angled caudally) and so with theirprolonged eruption they compress all of the cheek-teeth occlusal surfaces in a rostral direction (Fig. 3). For unknown reasons, perhaps to lengthen the head to allow better visualisation of predators whilebrowsing/eating, some primitive animals includingthe ancestors of equids, developed a space betweentheir incisors/canines and cheek teeth, termed thephysiological diastema or \"bars of the mouth.\" This in turn necessitated a further evolutionary develop-ment, i.e., of caudal angulation of the clinical crown ofthe rst cheek tooth (Triadan 06) that compresses theocclusal surfaces of cheek teeth in a caudal direction;otherwise all of the cheek teeth would tip rostrallyfrom the forces of the caudal cheek teeth (Figs. 3and 4). To enhance their masticatory function, the equine maxillary jaws and thus their maxillary cheek teethbecame further apart than the mandibles and themandibular cheek teeth ( anisognathia ). This dif- ference marked between the caudal cheekteeth, with the maxillary rows being a mean of 23%wider than the mandibular rows and more so indonkeys. 5The occlusal angles of the teeth are higher in horses than in brachydont teeth even atbirth, but they do not all have a 15\u00b0 angle as wastraditionally believed. The mandibular cheek-teeth occlusal 30\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 on the caudal (Tria-dan 10s, 11s) teeth. In contrast, the maxillarycheek teeth have angles of circa 15\u00b0 rostrally, but,their to brachydont teeth, the mesial (rostral) age- related drift (movement) of teeth is also influencedby normal masticatory pressures and both processeshelp keep the occlusal aspect of brachydont teeth inclose contact. A similar rostral drift of cheek teethalso occurs in horses, but this can only extend as faras the Triadan 06 (rst cheek tooth) whose clinicalcrown is angled caudally. The very complex move-ments of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) havebeen well studied in humans, 11but not fully in horses,12and the orthodontic forces the equine TMJ creates on equine dental drift is poorly understood.Pressure from the mesial (towards midline) an-gulation 03s (corner occlusal aspects of all six incisors inclose contact with each other (and thus preventingincisor diastema formation) in most horses until oldage.

(Dissection LECTUREThe Triadan system of dental nomenclature is now standard in equine dentistry. The teeth ineach quadrant are numbered from rostrally i.e.,Triadan 1 (central incisor) to caudally i.e., caudal cheek tooth; third molar) andthese numerals comprise the last two digits of thissystem. The quadrants; right maxillary, left max-illary, left mandibular, and right mandibular, la-beled 1 to 4, respectively (Fig. 5), are the rst digit ofthe system. For example, the left maxillary centralincisor is termed Triadan 201 and the right mandib-ular sixth cheek tooth (third molar) is Triadan 411.Deciduous teeth have 4 added to their rst digit,thus the right central deciduous incisor is Triadan501 (that is replaced at approximately 2.5 years ofage by Triadan 101). Dental Tissues EnamelEnamel, the hardest of all body tissues, is composedof 96% hydroxyapatite crystals and just 4% organic components, mainly proteins. The ameloblasts thatform enamel die when the tooth erupts, conse-quently it is thereafter essentially a dead tissue andconsequently cannot repair itself if it becomes dam-aged. The complete enamel content of teeth hasbeen laid down when the tooth erupts and enamelcontent progressively decreases over time with den-tal wear. Little enamel may be present in the clin-ical crowns of some larger breeds of horses over 25years of age, with the remaining clinical and reservecrown being entirely composed of cementum anddentine i.e., smooth mouth. 7 Horses evolved two main types of enamel that can only be identied at microscopy). 13These enamel, parallelsheets and rows of hydroxyapatite columns. Thistype of enamel is extremely hard and is the maintype of enamel present in the cheek teeth (especiallymaxillary cheek teeth), which undergo prolongedhigh levels of masticatory forces. second maintype ori-ented (spaghetti-like) in all three planes and thus isvery resistant to facture, although it is softer thanType-I enamel. These properties make it ideal forequine incisors, which undergo massive shearingstresses when prehending food, but experience muchless occlusal wear than cheek teeth that are involvedin prolonged, high-pressure mastication. It may beno coincidence that cheek teeth, although containingstructurally harder enamel, undergo more sponta-neous, termed \"idiopathic - sors.15,16Structurally, the equine enamel layers are thickest parallel to the long axis of the jaw andthinnest where they invaginate into the tooth. 17 CementumCementum, the softest of three calcied dental tis-sues contains approximately 50% organic compo-nents including collagen, and water. It is attachedto enamel at the amelocemental junction both at the tooth periphery and also in the enamel-lined in-fundibulae of the incisors and maxillary cheek teeth.Infundibular cemental development or cementogen- esisbycementoblasts begins at the periphery of the infundibulae and proceeds centrally toward the cen-tral vascular channel that runs the length of theinfundibulum. This process occurs prior to erup-tion (nourished by vasculature on the occlusal as-pect of the dental sac) and for some months aftereruption of the tooth (from small rostral and caudalsubgingival vasculature). 18 In brachydont teeth, all the (cement) lies subgingivally and covers the root dentine whereit acts as an anchoring point for the periodontalligaments. As noted, cementum also covers the pe-ripheral enamel of the entire crown in modern Fig. 5. The Triadan system of dental nomenclature. The teeth are divided into four quadrants, beginning in the right maxilla(quadrant 1), moving anticlockwise to the left maxilla (quadrant 2) to the left mandible (quadrant 3) and right mandible (quadrant 4).With deciduous teeth, four is added to these prexes (i.e., are quadrants 5 to 8). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H114082017 83FRANK MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREequids, where subgingivally, it contains the attach-ments of the periodontal ligament. Additional pe-ripheral cementum is deposited on the reservecrown once it erupts from the connes of the alveo-lus (Fig. 6) and so peripheral cementum is much thicker in the clinical crown compared with the re-serve crown. 19Cementum has a major structural role in the clinical crown, including acting in conjunctionwith the also flexible dentine, to form a sandwich onboth sides of the hard but brittle enamel, forming a\"biological safety glass\" to prevent enamel fractures.Viable found in high concentrationwithin the more vascular gingival region and they canextend several millimeters occlusally on the clinicalcrown. 19Although the cementum covering the sub - gingival crown is an active connective tissue with avascular supply from the periodontal ligament, somemillimetres above the gingival margin, the cementumbecomes an inert tissue following loss of its vascularsupply. 5,19Once the tooth erupts, no further cemen - tum can be deposited onto the clinical crown. How-ever, subgingival cementum (the most reactive ofcalcied dental tissues) can be laid down in largequantities on the reserve crown or roots followingchronic dental infection or trauma. 20 In any case, due to the prolonged eruption of equine teeth, the subgingival aspect of the crown(reserve crown) that is covered in cementum even-tually erupts and becomes part of the clinical crown.DentineDentine, an elastic, avascular calcied tissue is themain structural component of teeth and along withperipheral cementum supports the surrounding,much harder but brittle com-posed of approximately 70% mineralized tissue with30% organic content, mainly collagen and water. 21 Odontoblasts , which produce predentine that later be- comes dentine, line the walls of the pulp horns andhave long cytoplasmic processes that extend from pre- dentine into the dentinal tubules across the full widthof dentine. These cytoplasmic processes life as secondary dentine is laid down andthe odontoblasts move more centrally in the decreas-ing-sized pulp horns. This intimate relationship be-tween odontoblasts that line the pulp and theircytoplasmic processes extending throughout dentinecreates a single functional unit termed the pulpdentin (pulpodentinal) complex that makes dentine a sensi- tive and vital tissue, capable of repairing itself. 21 In brachydont teeth such as humans, dentine is fully covered by enamel on the clinical crown and bycementum sub-gingivally, over the root dentine.Because of teeth,the overlying cementum and enamel present on theocclusal surface at the time of eruption soon becomesworn away (Fig. 7), exposing the dentine that waspresent pre-eruption (termed primary dentine ), that in turn becomes gradually worn away by normalmastication. In brachydont species, where dentineis very sensitive, dentinal exposure can cause greatpain, but for unclear reasons this does not occur innormal equine teeth. The surface of occlusal den-tine has apparently insensitive odontoblast pro-cesses protruding from it that are not stimulated bynormal masticatory forces. 17However, the misuse, i.e., the overuse of motorized dental equipment tofloat (perform odontoplasty ) the occlusal surface of cheek teeth, has clinically shown that dentine withapparently sensitive odontoblast processes is pres-ent below layer. Kempsonand colleagues 22showed severe occlusal dentinal damage, even with use of hand floats, following ex-cessive odontoplasty (over-floating; Fig. 8). Suchmistreated horses may immediately develop an-orexia, quidding, and bitting problems that may re-main for weeks. 23Such mistreated cases are sometimes alleged to have TMJ pain caused by hav-ing their mouth opened by a speculum for someminutes! On that spurious basis, all horses havinggeneral anaesthesia would have TMJ pain from hav- Fig. 6. These images of mandibular cheek teeth show a very thick layer of peripheral cementum, which is an integral structural com-ponent of such teeth. Cementum is much softer than the adjacentenamel whose ridges protrude above it. Note also, the recesseddentine on the occlusal surface. Note the ssure fracture in therst pulp of the left tooth (arrow), these are generally innocuouslesions. Fig. 7. This gure shows the later stages of development ofmaxillary cheek teeth. The image on the left shows an une-rupted tooth within its gelatinous dental sac (DS). Centrally,there is a recently erupted maxillary cheek tooth with remnantsof the DS still present.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREing their mouth open for much longer periods, butthis has not been recognized. As equine teeth erupt, the subocclusal primary dentine overlying the pulp horns becomes wornaway in normal attrition by masticatory forces.If it was not replaced, the underlying pulp cavitywould eventually become exposed and possibly leadto death of the tooth from chronic food and bacterialcontamination. The mechanism to prevent thisscenario is the constant laying down of secondary dentine on the subocclusal aspects, as well as on the walls of the pulp horns. Secondary dentine is lessmineralised than primary dentine and so absorbsdietary pigments and becomes darker than the ad-jacent primary dentine on the occlusal surface.This discoloration of obvi-ous as the \"dental star\" that is used (withquite limited accuracy) to age horses. The cheekteeth contain ve pulp horns in the four central(rectangular/square shaped) teeth and six in the(triangular shaped) rst and last cheek teeth (Tria-dan 06s and 11s), except for the upper 11s that haveseven pulp horns (Fig. 9). The initial equine sec-ondary dentine that is deposited around the circum-ference of the pulp horn has a regular structure 24 later, toward the centre of the pulp horn before itbecomes fully occluded, secondary dentine becomesquite equine irregular secondary dentine resembles tertiary dentine of other species, i.e., the type of dentine laid down in response topulpar insult (such as occurs in response to overly-ing enamel caries in humans or a dental fracturewith pulp exposure in horses). 20,21,26 Tertiary dentine can be either reactive or repara- mesenchymal pulpalcells, respectively. Tertiary dentine lacks ofthe normal cellular structure of primary or regularsecondary dentine, and essentially acts as a physicalbarrier to seal the pulp off from the noxious stimuliand prevents further damage. 21,26 PulpDental pulp is a soft, sensitive, vascular connectivetissue contained within pulp horns. It contains col-lagen, mesenchymal cells, nerves, lymphatics, andblood vessels that serve as nutrient source forthe odontoblasts and thus for dentine. 21The inter - connections between these pulp horns and roots (theendodontic system) in equine cheek teeth are com-plex and age related, 27,28and knowledge of this end- odontic (dental pulp related) anatomy is of great importance for endodontic therapy of equine teeth,which is increasingly performed. All equine cheek-teeth pulp horns may communi- cate via a common pulp chamber for up to 9 yearspost-eruption in maxillary cheek teeth and 15 yearspost-eruption in mandibular cheek teeth, althoughthe common pulp chamber typically begins to divideby 5 years of dental age. 28The number of interpul - par communications also decreases as the horseages, although there is much variability in the con-formation of the segmental pulp chambers. 28Man - dibular cheek teeth typically contain a rostral(mesial) and a caudal (distal) root, with the rostrallyand caudally located pulp horns eventually dividingbetween these roots, with some variation. Maxil-lary cheek teeth have one palatal (medial) and twobuccal (lateral; rostral and caudal) roots. The in- Fig. 8. This image shows the left mandibular cheek teeth of ahorse that has been grossly over-floated (excessive odonto-plasty). Such cases can have exposure of sensitive dentine (oreven of pulp) on the occlusal surface and therefore may showsigns of oral discomfort after such mistreatment. Fig. 9. Equine cheek teeth pulp numbering system of du Toitet al 5with maxillary teeth in the top row and mandibular teeth in the bottom row. The teeth on left are the 06s, the central teethrepresent the 07s to 10s and the 11s are represented on theright. The four central teeth in each arcade contain ve pulps,with additional pulps in the (triangular shaped) Triadan 06s and11s. In each tooth the pulp numbering begins the buccalaspect, from rostral communications within maxillary cheekteeth are more complex and varied than those in themandibular cheek teeth; a common pulp chamber ismaintained more frequently, but occasionally it di-vides into rostral and caudal segments. 28Increasing age in the horse is associated with decreased pulpvolume and extension of the pulp apically within thetooth. 28The incisors, canine, and rst premolars all have a single pulp canal (in young incisors it isdivided into two parts occlusally by the infundibu-lum) and all have a single root. Periodontal Tissues The primary purpose of the periodontal structuresis to flexibly attach the tooth to the bones of the jawsand allow for dental eruption. Gingiva, a rm mu-cous membrane surrounding the erupted tooth, isone of the four periodontal tissues. The gingiva,physically (by its attachment to the peripheralcementum by the marginal epithelium) and immuno-logically protect the underlying periodontal mem-brane (ligaments) from the oral environment thatcontains multiple species of bacteria, that would bepathogenic if they gained entry to the periodontalmembranes. The gingival sulcus is a shallow de-pression (/H110215 mm deep in normal horses) betweenthe gingiva and the clinical crown that becomesdeeper with periodontal disease. The periodontalligament, which lies between the tooth and alveolarbone, contains broblasts along with collagen bers.Large bundles of these collagen bers, termedSharpey's bres , connect the peripheral cementum to the alveolus and so flexibly attach and allow theprolonged eruption of the tooth. Distinct fea-tures of equine collagen bers that allow them toresist the prolonged high-pressure vertical andlateral forces of mastication and also allow pro-longed eruption have recently been described byStaszyk and colleagues. 29Periodontal tissues contain extensive vasculature to nourish it andthe adjacent cementum and bone (inner layer ofcapillaries) and also has specialized venules (withblind vessels and ampullae but without venousvalves) more peripherally and deep in the alveolusto act as shock absorbers during mastication.These vessels prevent excessive tooth movementand so protect the pulpar vasculature. 30,31The periodontal ligament also provides sensory infor-mation via mechanoreceptors regarding move-ment of the tooth within the alveolus and on thehardness of objects being bitten. The alveolar process, or the lamina dura (denta ) (but often not identi-able on computed tomography), is a thin dense layer of alveolar bone that contains the teeth thatoverlies the spongy, basal bone of the jaws. Thisarea of alveolar bone may sequestrate followingloss of its blood supply from trauma associatedwith dental extraction. If a tooth is lost, the al-veolar bone will degrade over time and becomespongy bone, indistinguishable from the remain-ing bones of the jaws. Domestication of the Horse Some of the earlier records of human contact withhorses come from the Palaeolithic period (circa40,000 BC) from the El Castillo cave paintings inSpain and later from cave paintings in Lascaux,France (circa 28,000 BC) which show Przewalski-like horses being hunted for food. Smaller num-bers of equine skeletons that had evidence of beingbutchered for food were found at human settlementsfrom around these periods and from a later period,tens of thousands of equine skeletons were found atsites in France where horses were driven over cliffsduring their migrations. Prior to the domestication of horses a person could travel very limited distances (e.g., some tens of ki-lometers per day) and carry limited loads (e.g., 50kg). With domestication of horses, considerablylonger distances could be travelled at much greaterspeeds and carrying much greater loads thus allow-ing humans to more freely and quickly travel longdistances for trade and communications (and unfor-tunately war). The development of equine domes-tication is claimed to have been one of the majorsteps in the socioeconomic development of primitivehumans. 32,33There is still some debate as to when the horse was rst domesticated, but current evi-dence suggests that it occurred circa 5000 years ago(3000 BC) in an area which is now in the Ukraine.From a veterinary dental viewpoint, it is interestingthat much of the scientic evidence for the rstdomestication of horses is dental related, i.e., frombit wear found in equine skulls, particularly from aritual burial site where a horse and chariot wereburied in Dereivka (Kazakhstan). The equineskulls at this site had erosions, up to 3 mm deep, onthe rostral aspect of the lower front cheek teeth (306,406) caused by bits; and remnants of bits made fromdeer horn have been found in these settlements. 33,34 Iron bits were used after the iron age (Fig. 10).

The massive advantages that horses brought to mankind is manifested by the immense increase inthe numbers of equine skeletons found in archaeo-logical excavations of human settlements after do-mestication, in contrast with previously where theywere scarce and showed evidence of butchering.Chemical analysis of pottery utensils also showsthat mares were milked for food at these early set-tlements. 33The contribution of horses to the trans - port of goods, rapid communications, agriculture,and military purposes at that time were enormous.The domesticated horses spread widely to all of Eu-rope, the Middle East, and Asia. Very mobilearmies such as those of Genghis Khan that had tensof thousands of horses, mainly owed their \"success\"in conquering other civilizations to their horses.Later civilizations also used horses in sports such aschariot racing in Greece and Rome. Later, withadvances in agriculture, horses played a major rolein agriculture, both tilling the soil and harvesting; inforestry, and at the beginning of the industrial rev-olution, in transporting freight on carts, and in tow-ing barges along canals. Horse coaches were themainstay of local and long-distance transport andmail communications also during this period, withteams of coach horses changed frequently to speedup communication links. During this period, manyequine sport disciplines developed and many differ-ent breeds of horses were created (including Thor-oughbreds for racing), but the mainstay of horsework was for carriage and farm work. Because ofthe enormous economic importance of horses, veter-inary studies in the 1700s, 1800s, and early 1900sconcentrated on this species, as later discussed. The development and rapid widespread use of trains decreased the need for horses for long-distance trans-port or mail delivery and the development of steamengines in barges soon replaced the use of horses forpulling barges. Horses were still needed in agricul-ture, forestry, and as carriage horses and for goodstransport within cities, with 500,000 working horsesin London alone in 1906. 35 In the beginning of the twentieth century, the advent of the internal combustion engine causedthe main decline in working horse numbers, withcars and lorries replacing horses in cities, and thetractor gradually replacing the horse in agricul-ture in all but the smallest farms in Westerncountries. Horse numbers greatly decreasedthroughout the twentieth century up until the 1950s.Simultaneously, equine veterinary studies, which un-til the early 1900s was the backbone of veterinaryeducation because of the pre-eminence of the horse,was neglected, with veterinarians now largely concen-trating on farm animal medicine, before switching toits current emphasis on small-animal studies. In Western countries, horses have made a large resurgence during the last 30 to 40 years, now pri-marily for sport and recreation. Thankfully, therehas been a parallel increase in equine veterinaryscientic studies during this time, although scien-tic studies in equine dentistry have lagged behindsmall-animal dental studies. 36 Early Veterinary Dentistry There is written evidence from ancient Babylon(circa 2200 BC) of veterinary treatments, and laterfrom the works of Aristotle in Greece circa 500 BCand later from Roman authors including Chiron andVegetius, the latter whose treaty on equine veteri-nary care was translated into English in 1528. 37 These latter authors described some disorders of theequine teeth and jaws. However, as was the casewith human treatments of that era, many (most)equine treatments including blood letting, blisteringof skin overlying \"diseased\" areas, ring and cauter-izing, and administering powerful purgatives wereof no medical value and were in fact, painful andharmful to the patient. It is amazing how suchobviously harmful \"remedies\" continued to be usedin both human and veterinary medicine even withinthe last 100 years. These treatments probably re-mained popular because they demonstrated the\"power\" of the clinician by inducing visible althoughlikely harmful effects such as by causing large blis-ters where irritant cantharides (poisonous, blister-ing preparation made from the bodies of a beetle)pastes were applied. There is little evidence of vet-erinary texts from Europe during the middle ages,but the Arabic literature on equestrianship flour-ished at this time. 37 Little signicant advances in equine dental knowledge or treatment occurred until the 1700swith the advent of the age of enlightenment and theparallel scientic revolution. During this time, ac-ademic veterinary colleges were developed, initiallyin France, later in Britain, and the rst US Veteri-nary College opening in 1875. 37Some advances in Fig. 11.

MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART dental treatments, in removalof large dental overgrowths, treating sinusitis, andextracting teeth (exodontia) were made in the 1700s. During the late 1800s when the importance of the horse in transport, agriculture, industry, and leisurewas still near its peak, more signicant advanceswere made in equine veterinary studies, such as inequine anatomy and physiology and to a much lesserextent in dentistry. Notable quotes from UK veter-inary texts of that time including from William Dick,the founder of Edinburgh Veterinary School, was\"The disease of the teeth attracting attention are butfew.\" 38 Fortunately, some Continental and American veter- inary surgeons were more interested in equine den-tistry and in the late 1800s, some innovative equinedental instruments were made by German veterinarysurgeons including Hauptner and Gunther, and byHausmann and McPherson in North America. Someof these excellent designed instruments are still inuse. 37Equine dental textbooks, including a seminal work by William Clarke39were published in the late 1800s and Merrillat's seminal equine dentistry textwas published in the United States in 1916. 40At last, there was increasing use of rational, scientic-baseddental treatments, and the rejection of many inhu-mane and nonvalidated treatments such \"lampas lesions\" (physiological engorgementof the hard palate in young horses) with hot irons,although the persistent use of hot irons to treatstrained equine tendons by some veterinarians in thecurrent century remains unfathomable. Treatmentsutilized in the late 1800s included oral extraction ofcheek teeth in cast horses and removal of overgrowthsby mechanical dental shears. Knowledge of sinusitistreatments including trephination and lavage had ac-tually been documented in French textbooks since theearly 1700s. Merrilat did not believe in some of thequackery performed at that time such as incisor reduc-tions \"to prevent them from keeping the cheek teethout of contact\" but stated \" It was easier to trim the incisors and collect fees than to give a lecture on anat-omy without pay.\" 41 Colyer, a professor of human dentistry in London, performed some important dental surveys on work-ing horses in London in the early 1900s. Theseshowed a high prevalence of periodontal disease thathe attributed to the coarse foodstuffs he found em-bedded in periodontal pockets of affected horses. 35 However, examination of images of some of his pre-served specimens 42show that cheek-teeth di - astemata were in fact the actual cause of thisperiodontal disease. 43 In the 1930s a large body of scientic knowledge was amassed by German veterinarians, in particular byErnest Becker, who performed disease-prevalence sur-veys and gross pathological studies on equine dentaldisorders. He also developed the rst mechanizedequine floats. 37In contrast, for much of the mid-to- late 1900s the English-speaking world virtually ig-nored equine dental research (along with most otherequine veterinary research). Clinical dentistry wasalso largely ignored by the veterinary profession,except for extraction of apically infected teeth andtreating dental fractures and major dental over- growths, all conditions that did not respond tomedical treatments and were of such serious con-cern that they could not be ignored by the ownerand thus by the owner's veterinarian. The improved economic situation worldwide in the second half of the twentieth century led to aresurgence of interest in equestrian sports. Thisin turn led to a revival of equine veterinary inter-est and resulted in the founding of fully equineveterinary bodies including the American Associ-ation of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) and the Brit-ish Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) in the1960s. These organizations promoted a major re-vival in equine veterinary interest with a criticalscientic basis. Subsequently, in the 1970s and1980s there were major scientic and clinical de-velopments in many equine specialities, especiallyin the orthopaedic, respiratory, and reproductionelds. In contrast, with the exception of a hand-ful of authors including Hofmeyer in South Af-rica, 44Honma et al45in Japan, and Baker46,47in who performed equine dentalanatomy and infundibular caries in the 1970s.Minimal scientic advances were made in equinedentistry between the 1940s and the 1990s. Dur-ing this period, university curricula largely ig-nored equine dentistry or poorly taught it,perhaps giving a single lecture on cheek-teeth re-pulsion, as was the case in the author's veterinaryschool. More recently, there has been a signicant revival in scientic equine dental studies including grosspathological studies by Wafa 48in Ireland. Walms - ley in the United Kingdom was the rst author tocritically examine the ageing of horses by incisorexamination and showed its inaccuracy 49and Kilic and coworkers13,17,24,50in Scotland performed de - tailed histological ultrastructural studies of thenormal equine calcied dental structures. the eminent editor of the Equine Veteri-nary Journal (EVJ), with his usual foresight also rec- ognized this deciency in equine dental studies and in1993, devoted an issue of EVJ's sister journal, EquineVeterinary Education (EVE), to equine dentistry thatcontained editorial, \"Equine disease\u2014A ne-glected study.\" 51This edition contained origi - nal scientic papers on this topic, that encouragedother veterinarians to research and report on equinedentistry. Since then, clinical and scientic equid(equine and donkey) dentistry has had a major renais-sance worldwide, with very many scientic studiescoming from Europe including from Drs. Dacre and duToit 5,16,25,26,52-55in Edinburgh, Dr. Vlaminck in Bel Bienert, and colleagues in Ger-many, 8,28-31Dr. Simhofer Austria, articles LECTUREin the United Kingdom, and more recently, clinicalresearch from North American authors including Drs.Easley, Carmalt, Rawlinson, and Gal-loway. Currently, many articles arebeing published in different eminent journals world-wide that will be briefly discussed. However, it isregretful that with a few exceptions, American univer-sities have not been as proactive in equine dentalresearch as their European counterparts. In the 1970s and 1980s when the revival of scien- tic veterinary interest of horses was well under-way, equine clinical dentistry was ignored orperformed badly, and during this period lay persons,often terming themselves \"equine dentists\" lledthis vacuum. This period coincided with the devel-opment of motorized dental instruments and manyaggressive, nonvalidated dental treatments were re-vived or \"developed\" during this time, mainly by laypersons but also by some veterinarians. These in-cluded reductions (odontoplasty) of incisor and ca-nine teeth, removal of \"bitseating,\" and \"performance floating\" (the latter oftena euphemism for excessive floating) that were detri-mental to the horse and a summary of some of thesealleged \"Well Known Facts on Equine Dentistry\" arepresented in the Well Known \"Facts\" on Equine Dentistry (All Untrue!) Incisors should be regularly reduced (floated) to \"increase molar contact\" Canine teeth should be reduced \"to prevent injury to operator's hands\" All ridden horses should have good bit seats \"for their bitting comfort\" All wolf teeth must be extracted \"as they always cause bitting (and multiple other) problems\" All transverse ridges should be removed \"to promote rostral mandibular movement\" Any size of dental overgrowth can be reduced in a single procedure without risk of pulpar exposure All upper and lower cheek teeth occlusal angles should be floated to \"their normal angle of 15 degrees\" Older horses have thick subocclusal secondary dentine and so \"there is never any risk of pulpar exposure in this agegroup\". Horses that start quidding following routine dental treatment \"have strained temporomandibular joints (TMJs)\" For a short while, some American veterinarians also adopted these nonvalidated procedures, thatwere only based on pseudoscience. In the 1990s both BEVA and AAEP recognized the major deciency in their members' equine dentistryknowledge and practical skills and subsequently be-gan very active programmes to educate their mem-bers on current equine dental scientic knowledgeand also update their clinical dentistry techniques.Since 1998, more than 2000 BEVA members haveattended practical courses on equine dentistry withtremendous input initially from American col-leagues such as Jack Easley and Leon Scrutcheld.Likewise, AAEP has run numerous practicalcourses and major \"Focus\" conferences devoted toequine dentistry. With advances in scientic studies,publication of dentaltreatment studies and great efforts by nationalequine organizations, especially in the UnitedStates, Canada, Sweden, United Kingdom, Ger-many, and Australia to support theoretical andpractical aspects of this discipline, most or all ofthe aggressive dentistry techniques have nowbeen discarded by veterinarians. Many nationalequine associations now also run conferences, daymeetings, and practicals. The development ofspecialist equine sections of the American (AVDC)and European (EVDC) Veterinary Dental Collegesin 2013 with great help from Colin Harvey (asmall-animal veterinary dentist) has been a majorachievement. The development of these Collegeshas standardized and greatly raised clinical stan-dards and is allowing formal equine residencies tobe run. Currently we are fortunate that equinedentistry is practiced to a very high standard inmany countries by very many equine veterinarians. 2. A Review of Current Equine DentistryExamination of Equine Teeth Palpation through the cheeks may reveal food pock-eting or major cheek-teeth irregularities (such as amissing tooth or buccal dental fragment, a bucallydisplaced dental fragment or large overgrowth) ofthe cheek teeth, particularly of the rostral cheekteeth. Even if no abnormality is palpable exter-nally, the presence of pain during cheek palpationmay suggest the presence of buccal ulceration, mostcommonly due to sharp enamel overgrowths on thebuccal aspect of the upper cheek teeth. When eat-ing forage, horses with dental pain may not makethe normal vigorous crunching sounds and/or mayshow restricted mandibular movements that may beconned to one side of the mouth, or they may quid(drop unmasticated food from the mouth). Equine dental examination is best performed un- der sedation, except perhaps, for some asymptom-atic racehorses undergoing routine (especiallyrepeat) dental examinations, when sedation couldinterfere with racing schedules. A competentequine oral examination can only be performed us-ing a full-mouth speculum (gag), but incisor exami-nation should be performed prior toplacement of the speculum. The equine incisorsand canine teeth are readily examined, and thuseven minor disorders of these teeth are readily de-tected, including by owners. With the mouthclosed, and while stabilizing the head, the mandibleshould be moved sideways and the amount of side-ways movement prior to separation of the incisors(as the angled occlusal surfaces of opposing cheekteeth come into contact) should be assessed. Anysudden obstruction to this lateral movement (such AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 89FRANK by large cheek-teeth overgrowths) shouldbe noted. There is much variation in the degree ofincisor lateral movement before the incisors sepa-rate in normal horses, that is dependent on their jawanatomy and their variable cheek-teeth occlusalangles. 10 A more complete incisor and canine teeth exami- nation can be performed with a plastic pipe placed inthe bars of the mouth. The occlusal surfaces of theupper incisors are best examined with a dental mir-ror or oral endoscope, unless the examiner is verymobile! Due to a combination of oral anatomicalfeatures of herbivores, including limited opening ofthe mouth, rostral positioning of the lip commis-sures, and the great length of their cheek-teethrows, it is not possible to visually examine all of theequine cheek teeth (especially the caudal mandibu-lar cheek teeth), unless the examiner uses an equinedental mirror and headlight or an oral endoscope.Major problems, especially of the caudal mandibularcheek teeth and their gingiva, and all buccal areascan readily be missed unless all aspects of the teethand adjacent gingiva are carefully visually exam-ined and palpated. It is also useful to smell one'sgloved hand after oral examination for the presenceof malodor, which usually suggests anaerobic infec-tions, such as diastema-induced periodontal disease,fractures, or advanced dental caries (infection of themineralized components of teeth) are present. In addition to performing a thorough dental ex- amination it is essential that the ndings of theexamination are accurately recorded in a standard-ized manner on equine dental charts, such as thosesupplied by national equine organizations such asAAEP or BEVA. In addition to their professionalvalue, for example in monitoring the progress ofdental disorders, copies of these charts given to cli-ents can emphasize the quality of dental care theirhorses are receiving and also act as reminders forrevisits. Most of the equine tooth lies subgingivally and so cannot be visually examined. Consequently, imag-ing is required to assess disorders involving the re-serve crown and roots, such as apical infections andresorptive lesions. Radiography is the standardequine imaging modality, but it has limitations, par-ticularly in early cases of suspected apical infection,where subtle dental changes combined with super-imposed adjacent structures often makes accurateradiographic diagnosis difcult. With advances intechnology, including the advent of standing equinecomputed tomography systems, that will no doubtdecrease in price and increase in quality over thecoming years, such advanced three-dimensional im-aging techniques will become commonplace in thefuture and allow a more accurate diagnosis of manyequine dental disorders. Equine dental imaging in-cluding radiography and advanced imaging have re-cently been well reviewed. 58,59Dental Disorders IncisorsOverjet (upper incisors protruding overbite (upper incisors protruding ros- tral to and also directly in front of lower incisors) are often interchangeably given the colloquial term ofparrot mouth (Fig. 12). These are a cranio-facialskeletal disorder with secondary dental abnormali-ties and are hereditary to a varying degree. Theupper incisors often develop overgrowths, mostmarkedly of the 01s that them a \"smile\" ap-pearance. Even marked anatomical incisor abnor-malities seldom cause functional problems withprehension. 60,61The main clinical problem occurs later, with the development of focal, rostral upper06, and caudal lower 11 cheek-teeth overgrowths inadult horses, that may become tall enough to causesoft-tissue lacerations and/or masticatory and bit-ting problems. Potential treatments tension upper incisors and cheek teeth to retard growthof the upper jaw. 60If overbite is present, orthodontic tension wires andbite plates are necessary. These treatments will substantially improve, but not fullycorrect most cases. 61Owners of affected foals should be prepared to accept that most foals willdislodge or break these orthodontic prostheses atleast once, and that they need to be replaced, usuallyunder general anaesthesia. More invasive, osteo-distraction techniques that involve sectioning ofboth mandibles and insertion of expandable devicesto elongate the mandibles have also been used forcorrecting overjet/overbite. 62All cases of overjet or overbite, treated or untreated, should have at leastbiannual dental assessments, during which the in- Fig. 12. Lateral radiographs of a 6-month-old foal with over-bite. At this stage, placement of a tension band orthodonticdevice between the upper incisors and the maxillary cheek teethwould worsen the disorder, by bending the incisive and maxillarybones further ventrally. 90 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREcisors and cheek teeth can be assessed for over-growths, that should be reduced in (prognathism, primary craniofa-cial skeletal disorder with secondary dental abnor-malities (Fig. 13). This disorder is uncommon inlarger breeds of horses, but is common in donkeys,small ponies, and miniature horses. It is usuallyclinically insignicant unless there is total lack of oc-clusion between the upper and lower incisors. Se-verely affected equids will eventually develop aconcave upper incisor surface, which has beentermed a \"frown\" and these equidae will later developlower 06 and upper 11 overgrowths, that need assess-ment and treatment at least biannually. 60 Displaced IncisorsMost major incisor displacements involve the per-manent incisors and are developmental in origin dueto overcrowding of teeth or displacement of develop-ing dental buds 63(Fig. 14 ). Less commonly, they are caused by jaw trauma in foals with acquireddisplacement of the permanent incisor buds. If dis-placed incisors protrude at very abnormal angles,e.g., horizontal to the remaining incisors\u2014they needto be extracted (Fig. 14). The periodontal liga-ments in some of these displaced incisors may beweak, as they will not have had normal occlusalcontact and simple extraction is possible. However, if rmly attached, a surgical extraction (raising a gingival flap over the reserve crown, and variableremoval of alveolar wall) is usually necessary. 64 Lesser degrees of incisor displacement can betreated by placement of orthodontic tension wiresanchored to adjacent incisors. Minor displace-ments may also be treated by regular floating ofprotruding areas (including by owners) for example,using a small diamond-coated \"S\" float. 65 Retained Deciduous IncisorsDeciduous incisors, which normally lie on the occlu-sal or labial aspects of their permanent counter-parts, are occasionally retained beyond their normaltime of shedding. This may be due to a misplacedpermanent dental bud that does not develop beneaththe deciduous and thus assist in the resorption andphysical shedding of the deciduous tooth. Whenretained for a prolonged period, they will cause theerupting permanent incisor to be displaced furtherlingually/palatally (caudally) and may even cause per-manent wear changes in the opposite incisors. Loose, Fig. 13. This 4-year-old pony has multiple developmental inci-sor abnormalities, including underjet, displacement and rotationof 302, displacement of 202, and also the acquired disorders ofperiodontal disease, and calculus deposition on 202. Fig. 14. This Triadan 301 has marked developmental displacement and rotation and consequently would continue to cause liptrauma until extracted. Although it had a long clinical crown and thus extensive periodontal ligaments, these attachments were notstrong and with limited elevation (circa 10 mm) below the gingival margin, a simple non-surgical extraction was possible. AAEP 63 /H114082017 91FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART can be removed using dental forceps.If more rmly attached, they will need to be extractedunder sedation and local anaesthesia using a sharpdental luxator or scalpel to cut the strong gingivalattachments and then elevators to fatigue their peri-odontal attachments. If it seems that the reservecrown is very long, a surgical extraction is required.It is most important that retained incisors are differ-entiated from supernumerary incisors. Rarely, re- tained their extraction difcult.Supernumerary IncisorsSupernumerary incisors (i.e., permanent incisorsthat are additional to the normal six incisors on eacharcade) can have very long ( /H110217.0 cm) reserve crowns, that are often intimately interwoven be-tween the reserve crowns and roots of the normalpermanent incisors. In addition, given that super-numerary incisors are usually identical in appear-ance to the normal incisors (i.e., are termedsupplemental teeth) they are usually impossible to visually or radiographically differentiate from nor-mal incisors. Consequently, extraction of these su-pernumerary teeth is often both very difcult andalso risks damaging the adjacent normal incisors.Exceptions are the presence of individual supernu-merary incisors that protrude subgingivally\u2014thatcan be more readily surgically extracted. As super-numerary incisor teeth usually cause little clinicalproblems unless grossly displaced, they are usuallybest left in situ , with biannual rasping of unopposed teeth to prevent overgrowths, or extraction, ifmarked periodontal disease later develops between/around them. Incisor Fractures Fractures of the incisor teeth and often of the sup-porting rostral mandibular or incisive (premaxil-lary) bones can occur due to trauma, usually fromkicks but rarely \"spontaneously\" unlike cheek teeth.If a limited amount of calcied dental tissues arefractured without any exposure of the pulp cavity\u2014this is termed an uncomplicated dental fracture . Such fractured teeth are endodontically (pulpar tis-sues) healthy and will continue to be pain free anderupt normally. Any sharp edges present must becarefully floated to prevent lingual or labial lacera-tions. Unfortunately, incisor fractures more com-monly result in exposure of the pulp horns (i.e.,termed a complicated dental fracture ) and bleeding will be seen on the occlusal surface from the exposedpulp (Fig. 15). 66 Pulpar exposure always results in pulpar inflam- mation and infection that are caused by pH changesdue to contact with saliva, and by impaction of foodand oral bacteria into the pulp horn. All youngequine teeth have very wide apical foraminae (rootcanal openings), along with a very large and vascu-lar pulp, which can often resist inflammation-induced ischemia. Consequently, pulp exposure, especially in younger horses, does not necessarily lead to deeppulpar infection and inflammation and subsequentischemia with tooth death, as would occur with asimilar pulp exposure in brachydont (e.g., human orcanine) teeth. All incisor fracture cases should re-ceive tetanus antitoxin and prolonged (7-10 days)antibiotic therapy (preferably antibiotics reduce pulpar inflammation. Preferably, end-odontic (root canal) treatment should be performedby a specialist veterinary surgeon to save thetooth. 64Such endodontic treatment that once was rare is now regarded as a standard, successful pro-cedure. An additional rst-aid treatment thatcould be performed by general equine practitionersprior to referral is to apply local anaesthetic withadrenaline and then debride the exposed pulp withan 18-g needle to create a 5-mm deep cavity in pulpcanal. Following haemostasis by cotton buds andlavage with 0.1% chlorhexidine, a semisolid calciumhydroxide paste can be placed into the overlying Fig. 15. The clinical crowns of 101, 102, and 103 of this horse have recently sustained complicated (i.e., with pulp exposure) fractures.Removal of the fracture fragments (right image) conrms these pulpar exposures and shows viable, bleeding pulps in all three pulphorns. With appropriate treatment (i.e., endodontic therapy) all of these teeth should survive, then erupt faster than usual due tolack of occlusal contact and eventually come into occlusion. /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE act as a pulpar dressing. Calciumhydroxide is antibacterial due to its high pH andstimulates tertiary dentine formation. However,these calcium hydroxide pastes may be quickly lostin some cases, unless an additional overlying, moresolid (usually UV light cured) layer is added. Abnormalities of Incisor Wear On full manual, lateral movement of the mandiblewith the horse's jaws closed, the incisors shouldseparate. The degree of separation varies greatlybetween horses and as noted, incisor reductions toallow further incisor occlusal separation to unsub-stantiated rigid dimensions is an unwarranted pro-cedure. Irregularities of the occlusal surface of theincisors (or large overgrowths of the cheek teeth)will prevent or restrict this normal maneuver, usu-ally unilaterally. Incisor disorders that restrict lat-eral jaw movement include overgrowths due totraumatic loss or maleruption (delayed eruption,displaced or other abnormalities of eruption) of anopposite incisor. Such cases should have over-grown areas sequentially (e.g., 3 mm at a time)reduced previouslynoted occur with and underjetrespectively, are generally best left alone unless softtissue is being traumatized. Abnormal wear devel-ops on the occlusal and labial aspects of the Triadan01s (central) and sometimes of the 02s horses that crib-bite, wind-suck, incisors on xed objects. Diagonal Bite (Slant Mouth; Slope Mouth) A minor degree of diagonal bite is present in a sig-nicant number of horses. This disorder was pre-viously believed to be generally caused by unilateral,painful cheek-teeth disease, causing the horse topreferentially use the opposite side of its mouth formasticating, thus causing secondary incisor wearabnormalities. The perceived treatment was tomechanically level the incisors and float the cheekteeth to remove the \"problem.\" A large study byDeLorey 67showed that such incisor adjustments were seldom of value because the occlusal surfacequickly reverted to the pre-treatment diagonalstate. It is now accepted that most such incisorabnormalities are secondary to craniofacial bone ab-normalities, primarily wry nose (lateral deviation ofthe nasal and incisive bones) but also due to otherdevelopmental abnormalities, including of the max-illary bones that can be appreciated by recognizingthe unequal angles and heights of the vaults of thehard palate. 68 Diastema/Periodontal Disease Incisors, like cheek teeth, taper in toward their api-ces and unless there is adequate rostro-medial (me-sial) angulation of the 03s spaces termeddiastema in the in- terdental (interproximal ) spaces that allow food trapping between the incisors. These diastemataare usually termed valve diastemata because they are narrower occlusally than at the gingival margin.Forage trapped in diastemata may get compressedinto the gingivitis initially, andeventually becomes compressed more apically, dam-aging three deeper periodontal tissues (peri-odontal membranes, peripheral cementum andalveoli) in periodontal disease. It can be difcult toremove matted impacted forage between incisors,which also accumulates on as-pect of incisors. Widening the occlusal aspect ofthese diastemata to circa 3 mm wide, that will allowall impacted food to be removed, including from peri-odontal pockets, is a possible treatment. Treateddiastemata (now termed open diastemata ), because they are the same width at occlusal and gingivalaspects, tend to trap food less. They also allowowners to clear entrapped food with a normal tooth-brush to help prevent periodontal disease. Equine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption andHypercementosis This is a recently described, painful disorder ofincisor and canine teeth of older horses, variablycausing periodontitis, with and/orproliferative with similar dental syndromes in cats (felineresorptive syndrome) and in humans, except thatsome horses also develop a high degree of hyperce-mentosis that can mask the initial resorptive le-sions (Fig. 16). Allowing suspected cases to bite acarrot at different sites on its incisors will helpidentify painful teeth and radiography of suspectteeth is essential for complete evaluation of thisdisorder (Fig. 17). Horses with extensive hy-percementosis can be recognized by the subgingi-val thickening of the incisor alveoli. These teethare often very stable and pain free and so in theabsence of periodontal disease, such cases do notneed any treatment at this time. However,horses that develop more lytic lesions often de-velop fractures of teeth and if resorptive lesionsdevelop near the gingival border, this will permitperiodontal disease to develop. 64,66The presence of fractured teeth and periodontal disease cancause great pain and is a serious welfare problemfor affected horses. Currently, there is no knowntreatment for EOTRH-affected teeth, and loose,fractured and painful teeth should be extracted.If multiple teeth on an arcade are affected, it maybe preferable to surgically extract all six incisorstogether. 64If just one or two incisors remain fol - lowing exodontia of the remaining teeth, theseteeth, now without any support from adjacentteeth, may quickly become loose. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 J. MILNE rostral aspect of the mandible near the symphy-sis is a predilection site for the development of bro-osseous growths in young horses. The preciseclassication of these tumors as neoplasms or anequally destructive non-neoplastic growths can beproblematic. Radical resection of the rostral man-dible is a successful treatment with surprisinglyminimal functional consequences to loss of the lowerincisors. 70Less commonly, more benign bro- osseous lesions can affect the upper incisor region,but the treatment is similar, i.e., early radical resec-tion of the affected area (Fig. 18). Canine Teeth Occasionally, one or more canine teeth will havedelayed eruption, and the mucosa overlying suchareas may be painful on palpation and delayed erup-tion of canine teeth may possibly be associated withbitting problems (Fig. 19). Incision of the overlyingmucosa and periosteum, i.e., operculation , may help the eruption of such teeth. Canine teeth, in partic-ular the lower canine teeth, are the equine teethmost prone to calculus formation. This is for un-clear reasons, possibly the absence of direct apposi-tion of the upper and lower canine teeth, that wouldforce brous forage over their surfaces and reduceorganic plaque formation. This calculus commonlycauses a local gingivitis but seldom involves the(three) deeper periodontal tissues. Canine calculusis readily removed with forceps and subgingival ar-eas of calculus should then be carefully, fully curet-ted off. Owners should be advised to brushsusceptible canine teeth with a toothbrush at leasta few times weekly to prevent the initial buildupof organic plaque that will later calcify and formcalculus. Canine Teeth EOTRH As well as affecting incisors, EOTRH also affects thecanine teeth of older horses, sometimes severely(Fig. 17), and occasionally, without any obvious si-multaneous clinical involvement of the incisors.This may be manifested as the presence of caries-like lesions or spontaneous fractures of canine teeth(possibly multiple canine teeth). Radiography willreadily conrm its presence and severely affectedteeth especially with erosive lesions on the clinicalcrown and periodontal disease need extraction.This invariably has to be a surgical extraction, giventhat even older horses may have /H110225 cm of the canine tooth reserve crown. \"Wolf Teeth\" (Vestigial First Premolars) There are no deciduous wolf teeth (Triadan 05, 1stpremolar) and it is believed that most wolf teeth arelost when the permanent 06s erupt; consequently,yearlings more commonly have these teeth thanadult horses. Wolf teeth are blamed for interfering with the bit and otherwise causing many behavioralproblems in ridden horses, and on this basis theseteeth are frequently extracted. Wolf teeth mostcommonly occur in the maxilla and lie in front of the106/206. It is anatomically difcult to envisage how,if small and in a normal position, these teeth could Fig. 16. Upper incisors of an aged horse with EOTRH. There iscalculus at the gingival margins, evidence of thickening of thereserve crowns, clinical crown fractures of 101 and 201; and mostsignicantly, gingival recession and gross swelling over the alve-olus of 202 that has a sinus tract. Fig. 17. This radiograph shows marked EOTRH of the mandib-ular canine teeth and all incisors. The canine teeth have moresevere resorptive-type lesions whereas the incisors have morehypercementosis-type lesions, couldmask internal lytic lesions. These incisors with hypercemento-sis are stable and pain free and currently do not need any treat-ment. The grossly lytic canine teeth with secondary periodontaldisease need to be /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART the bit. In contrast, the rarely encoun-tered mandibular wolf teeth can readily interfere withthe bit. Some veterinarians use the argument thatbecause these teeth never do any good and may occa-sionally cause problems, they should always be re-moved. Although there is no objective evidence that normal-sized and positioned maxillary wolf teethshould be extracted, large, displaced or persistentlyunerupted wolf teeth can cause cheek or gingivaltrauma, from bit pressure and these teeth should beextracted in ridden horses (Fig. 20). Using local an-esthesia and sedation, long, sharp, offset wolf-teethelevators can effectively be used to cut the gingiva andstress the periodontal ligament in a conventional man-ner before using forceps to extract these teeth. Developmental Cheek-Teeth Disorders Retained Deciduous TeethRetention of the remnants of the deciduous cheekteeth (\"caps\") can occur in horses between 2 and 5years of age. When very loose or just partially re-tained by gingival attachments, they may causeperiodontal pain or soft-tissue lacerations. Af-fected horses may suddenly show quidding, playingwith the bit, and occasionally, loss of appetite for acouple of days. Such signs of oral discomfort inyoung horses immediately warrant a careful exam-ination of the rostral three cheek teeth for evidenceof loose \"caps\" or caps with a distinct space betweenthem and the underlying erupting cheek tooth.Food trapping between a retained cap and the un-derlying erupting tooth can induce deep occlusalcaries of the latter that occasionally lead to pulparand then to apical infection, even before this perma-nent tooth fully erupts. Retained caps should beremoved using specialized \"cap\" forceps or a long,slim elevator. The prolonged retention of caps has been alleged to cause delayed eruption of the underlying develop-ing permanent tooth, thus causing the developmentof large \"eruption cysts\" (\"3-year-old or 4-year-oldbumps\") under their apices. presence of en-larged eruption cysts, especially if unilateral orpainful, should prompt a thorough oral and radio-graphic examination for the presence of retaineddeciduous cheek teeth or apical infection or even jawtrauma. The practice of methodically removing\"caps\" at rigid set ages in horses will result in thepremature removal of some deciduous cheek teethand by removing the overlying dental sac and blood Fig. 18. The left image shows a large bro-osseous growth of the incisive area of a pony, with subsequent loss of some and displacement of other upper incisors. Following radiography to conrm its nature and to determine surgical boundaries, thecomplete mass (and a 10-mm margin) was resected and the gingiva sutured with primary closure (middle image). There was norecurrence of the growth and the image on the right shows this horse 5 years later, having fully coped with loss of the upperincisors during this time. Fig. 19. This horse has delayed eruption of a canine tooth (204)with inflamed mucosa containing a sinus tract overlying it, thatmay have caused recent bitting problems. Following local an-aesthesia, a cruciate incision was made through the overlying softtissue and periosteum (operculation) to promote its 63 /H114082017 95FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART underlying permanent tooth.Diastema(ta)Although cheek-teeth diastemata are usually a devel-opmental disorder, the main pathological changes theycause, i.e., periodontal disease, is an acquired dentaldisorder. The occlusal surfaces of all six cheek teethin each quadrant should normally be compressedtightly together (similar to incisors) with the completerow of six cheek-teeth functioning as a single mastica-tory unit. This, as noted, is due to the caudal angu-lation of the clinical crown of the rst cheek tooth (06)and the rostral angulation of the clinical crowns of thelast two cheek teeth (Triadan 10 and 11) compressingthe occlusal aspect of all six cheek teeth together (Figs.3 and 4). Even with normal eruption (the cheek teethtaper in slightly from clinical crown to apex) the pro-gressively smaller reserve crowns usually remaintightly compressed at the occlusal surface until oldage.However, if diastemata develop between the cheek teeth, clinical problems inevitably occur. Cheek-teeth diastemata are often 2 to 5 mm wide, narrowerat their occlusal aspect, i.e., narrow in valve di-astemata or wider in open diastemata. In somecases, the cheek-teeth diastemata can be termed asprimary diastemata that are caused by lack of an- gulation of the rostral and caudal cheek teeth or bycheek teeth with adequate angulation developingtoo far apart to provide enough compression at theirocclusal surfaces (Fig. 21). 65,71In other cases, di - astemata termed secondary diastemata occur adja- cent to developmental or acquired displaced teeth,overcrowded supernumerary teeth, and overgrowncheek teeth at the periphery of cheek-teeth rows.In some aged horses, the eruption and thus loss ofangulated reserve crown means that the narrowerolder teeth cannot be compressed effectively andsenile diastemata (often multiple) occurs between them. Affected horses are often asymptomatic or Fig. 20. There could be little debate that this very large and rostrally displaced wolf tooth (205) needed to be extracted in this ridinghorse. Its gingival attachments were cut and its periodontal membranes stressed using sharp, long, offset wolf tooth elevators andwhen loose, it was extracted intact with appropriately sized forceps, revealing its long root. Fig. 21. These diagrams show two possible mechanisms for the development of \"primary\" cheek teeth diastemata in young horses.The prognosis is better for horses with normally angled cheek teeth that develop too far apart (right image), because with furthereruption, these teeth may eventually develop good occlusal 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. fewer signs when at pasture compared withwhen indoors on forage. Due to the prolonged mastication of horses (in- termittently for up to 18 hours/day), food (usuallybrous forage) will become impacted into any ab-normal interproximal (interdental) spaces. Occa-sionally, food will remain between the moreocclusal aspects of the clinical crowns and notcome in contact with the gingiva; such horses areasymptomatic and do not need treatment. Morecommonly, food becomes compressed more apicallyinto the gingiva and leads to progressively deeperfood impaction and gingival recession (Fig. 22).As previously described for incisors diastemata,deeper penetration of food will later cause second-ary deeper periodontal disease, involving thethree other periodontal tissues due to the presenceof these porous foreign bodies 72(Fig. 23 ) and sec- ondary bacterial infection including multiple spe-cies of bacteria that are also found in the healthyequine oral cavity. 73Equine oral bacteriology has been a greatly neglected area until recently,partly because a high percentage of oral bacteriacannot be conventionally cultured. Thankfully,current molecular bacteriology techniques aregradually casting light on this important area. 73 The continued compression of food into these in-flamed, sensitive tissues causes great pain during mastication. Consequently, many diastema-affectedhorses show severe clinical signs including quidding,bitting problems, and even weight loss. 71,74Cheek- teeth diastema(ta) is the most common painfulequine dental disease in the author's clinic. 71,74Some horses show these clinical signs when fed for-age and improve greatly when at short grass. Sec-ondary sinusitis due to an oromaxillary stula canalso occur, especially in older horses. 75 Check teeth diastemata is the most common very painful dental disease of horses. Cheek-teeth diastemata should be considered to be present in all horses showing quidding or othersigns of painful oral disease. This disorder, whichcommonly affects the caudal mandibular cheekteeth, can be recognized by visually (headlight andangulated equine dental mirror or an oral endoscopeessential) and by digitally detecting small spacesbetween the cheek teeth at gingival level, along withfood bers packed deep in the periodontal spacesbetween the teeth. In longer-standing cases, thisfood pocketing will extend along the lingual/palataland buccal sides of affected teeth and can even ex-tend deep into the mandible or into the maxillarysinuses. 75Obtaining 10-15\u00b0, latero-oblique radio - graphs with the horse's mouth open,76can be very useful to investigate and especially to prognosticateon cheek-teeth diastemata cases. Treatment of cheek-teeth diastemata can lematic. Impacted food should always removedfrom diastemata using specialized long, right-angledpicks and diastema forceps and/or a high-pressurediastema pump. It can be difcult to fully debride Fig. 22. This intraoral image shows diastemata and deep peri-odontal pocketing of forage between the lingual aspect of rostralleft mandibular cheek teeth. More commonly, such diastemataare found between the more caudal mandibular cheek teeth,particularly between 9/10 and 10/11. Fig. 23. This oral endoscopic image of a mandibular cheek toothdiastema following removal of impacted food, shows the two ad-jacent teeth to be covered in a thick gray plaque, likely due torestricted intra-oral food movement. There is marked gingivalinflammation with swelling adjacent to the diastema, and com-plete loss of gingival, and deeper periodontal tissues within thediastema.

Removal of as much food as possible willusually give temporary clinical relief as will theadministration of NSAIDs. Feeding only a nelychopped (milled) forage diet (a few mm in length),e.g., grass or alfalfa cubes often reduces or removesclinical signs as these short bers do not becomeentrapped between teeth. In younger horses with good cheek-teeth angu- lation and less severe diastemata, the abnormalspaces may spontaneously close with further den-tal eruption and drift. Consequently, wideningsuch diastemata may just delay a natural resolu-tion of this disorder. Cleaning and drying suchdiastemata and lling them with soft impressionplastic material (Fig. 24) or heated wax strips, willprotect the underlying periodontal pockets fromlling with food, if the packing remains in place.The occlusal surfaces should be carefully ridges\" the teeth op-posite open diastemata, which may widen thediastemata and selectively force food into them.These overgrowths should always be removed ifthey are detected during biannual examination ofsuch cases. If diastemata associated with severe periodontal disease is present, especially in older horses, widen-ing the diastemata may result in complete cessationof quidding in many cases, 71,74given that food is less likely to become permanently entrapped in a widerinterdental space (open diastema). Great caremust be taken not to damage adjacent pulp hornsduring diastema widening (Fig. 25). One recentstudy showed complete resolution of signs in 73%(that was a long-term improvement in 51%) andpartial response in 17% of cases following diastemawidening. A delayed but good response was re-corded for 19% of cases that took over a month torespond following diastema widening. Many caseswill need repeat treatment due to drifting of teethinto the previously widened spaces. Filling thewidened diastemata with plastic materials can be ofvalue, and may enhance the effects of widening. Theuse of harder acrylic ling materials can be very suc-cessful in the short term, but these llings will even-tually become dislodged due to dental movements anderuption and they may then cause severe oral trauma.Some young horses with severe, widespread di-astemata will be very difcult to treat\u2014and if radio-graphs show insufcient angulation of their cheekteeth, the problem will persist for life. Senile di-astemata and periodontal disease can lead to toothloss in older horses with short reserve crowns.Rostral Positioning of the Maxillary Cheek-TeethRowRostral positioning of the maxillary cheek teethrelative to their mandibular counterparts is an-other manifestation of the developmental cranio-facial abnormality that causes incisor overjet/overbite. This abnormality eventually leads to the development of focal overgrowths on the rostral as-pect of upper 06s that may cut the cheeks and in-terfere with the bit. If small (e.g., 1 to 5 mm high),they can be floated fully at one treatment, but whenthey are tall ( /H110225 mm), reductions (odontoplasty) should be performed in stages of say 3 to 4 mm, a fewmonths apart (Fig. 26). It may not be necessary (orpossible in some cases) to fully reduce all cheek-teeth overgrowths but one must ensure that they arenot causing soft-tissue trauma, restricting jawmovements, causing a diastema, or interfering withother teeth. Similarly, overgrowths develop 1 to 3 years later on the caudal aspect of the lower 11s and frequentlygo undetected unless a thorough oral examination isperformed. These caudal overgrowths can laceratethe adjacent oral mucosa and should be reducedwith power instruments. The use of \"molar cut-ters\" and percussion guillotines (that encircle caudal Fig. 24.

Cheek-Teeth Displacements Two different causes of cheek-teeth displacementscan occur in horses. The most severe medial (lin-gual/palatal) or lateral (buccal) displacements aredevelopmental, possibly due to overcrowding of thedental rows during eruption or to developmentallydisplaced dental buds, and this type of displacementis often bilateral, and involves the lower 09s and10s. 63Rotation of the displaced tooth can also be present (Fig. 27). Large overgrowths later developon areas of the displaced tooth and of their occlusalcounterparts, which are not in normal occlusion.As noted, displaced cheek teeth usually have di-astemata between them and adjacent cheek teeththat will often cause painful periodontal disease andthe previously described signs. Sharp, protrudingareas of displaced cheek teeth and secondary over-growths can lacerate the oral soft tissues and causeadditional oral pain. Acquired cheek-teeth dis-placements (usually of the caudal mandibular cheekteeth) are caused altered orthodontic forcescaused by abnormal masticatory pressure and/or di-rections. This type of displacement most commonlydevelops in older horses\u2014possibly secondary to oralpain (such as from periodontal disease) or neglecteddental overgrowths. Acquired displacements usu-ally have lesser degrees of smaller overgrowths (the latter also suggeststhat the than develop-mental displacements. Smaller abnormal (lateralor medial) protrusions of teeth or overgrowths are Fig. 25. Treating severe, diastema-induced periodontal disease by diastema widening is very helpful for the majority of cases. However, this procedure can be difcult between caudal mandibular cheek teeth that are always hidden by the tongue and socarries signicant risks, especially for untrained operators. This radiograph is of a horse whose oral pain worsened followingdiastema widening. The radiograph shows gross damage to two mandibular cheek teeth (arrows). The damage to the 09 (andpossibly to the 10; two arrows) will certainly have exposed at least two pulps, and is also likely that the 08 also has two exposedpulps (single arrow). Fig. 26. This image shows a horse with very large overgrowthsof 106 and 206. Further examination of this horse also showedcaudal lower 11 overgrowths and incisor overjet, all of which aredental manifestations of the same developmental craniofacialskeletal abnormality. These 106 and 206 overgrowths, parts ofwhich are over 30 mm taller than the adjacent maxillary cheekteeth, need to be gradually reduced (possibly never to the level ofadjacent teeth). This odontoplasty should be performed incre-mentally over a number of years in order to avoid exposingsensitive dentine or pulp. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 99FRANK J.

Associated problematic diastemata willneed to be widened and/or lled and eventually, thedisplaced tooth may have to be extracted, which iseasier when advanced periodontal disease is presentand in older horses with shorter reserve crowns.Supernumerary Cheek TeethSupernumerary cheek teeth (i.e., presence of morethan six cheek teeth in a row) most commonly de-velop at the caudal aspect of the cheek-teeth rows(especially termed asTriadan 12s ordistomolars . 43,63,77They may be unilateral, bilateral, or even multiple. Supernu-merary teeth can lie in their own alveoli or alterna-tively can share an alveolus with an adjacent tooth.Supernumerary teeth often erupt in young adultswhen the normal adult teeth are erupting but cancontinue to develop even in teenage horses. Be-cause of their frequent irregular shape and over-crowding, periodontal food pocketing commonlyoccurs between them and normal adjacent teeth(usually the Triadan 11), with resultant that can causesoft-tissue lacerations and masticatory problems.When adjacent periodontal disease is present, su-pernumerary cheek teeth should be extracted ( per os always if possible\u2014they may have weak periodontalattachments).

MILNE wear or intercurrent disease(usually periodontitis) is not oligiodontia.DysplasiaAbnormal development can occur in any or all of thecheek-teeth tissue components. Some examples ofdifferent types of cheek-teeth dysplasia are pre-sented in Fig. 29. 3. Acquired Disorders of Cheek TeethOcclusal Wear Abnormalities and Overgrowths Some cases of uneven occlusal wear, including slightdegrees of wavemouth are caused by delayed erup- tion of the permanent cheek teeth in either themaxillary or mandibular rows, with overgrowth ofthe opposite teeth, that may then remain for life.Other, (more focal) overgrowths develop on a normaltooth that lie opposite a missing tooth or a tooth withlow enamel content that has low wear resistance.Such untreated localized overgrowths may initiatefurther abnormalities of wear such as wavemouthand more rectangular overgrowths termed step- mouth. Recognizing and removing or reducingsuch developmental overgrowths at an early stage isthe key to their successful treatment. The overgrown tooth is usually the normal tooth. Examine the opposing tooth for abnormalities. Because of their prolonged eruption (for circa 20 to 25 years in large horse breeds and up to 40 years indonkeys and small ponies) any areas of equine teeththat are not in full occlusion with an opposing toothcontaining similar levels of enamel will eventuallydevelop overgrowths on the unopposed areas. Do-mestication has greatly altered the equine diet withmany horses being fed large quantities of very calo-ric concentrates and consequently eating much lessforage over a shorter period. Feeding concentratesalso greatly alters the masticatory action of horses,causing them to chew with a more vertical thanlateral mandibular action. 79This restriction of full being often termed\"enamel points.\" These overgrowths are exacer-bated in horses whose maxillary cheek teeth haveprominent vertical ridges (cingulae; Fig. 30) andsome horses with this anatomical dental variationdevelop sharp buccal edges on these cingulae thatwill cause buccal ulceration, even when fed a 100%forage diet. The previously described absence of complete oc- clusal contact between the equine upper and lowercheek teeth (anisognathia) and angulation of theirocclusal surfaces are further to thedevelopment of dental overgrowths develop bu-cally the maxillary, and on the mandibular cheek teeth. If thesedental overgrowths are neglected, the sharp \"points\"may eventually merge into a steeply angulated (e.g.,/H1102245\u00b0) occlusal surface termed shearmouth (scissor mouth), although there may be additional craniofa-cial anatomical predispositions to shearmouth.A mechanical obstruction will now additionally ob-struct or even prevent the normal side-to-side man-dibular movements, and mastication will be evenless effective. Fig. 29. This gure shows three different examples of cheek teeth dysplasia. On the left is an abnormally large tooth that hasabnormal distributions of dentine, cementum, and enamel, including excessive cementum but virtually no enamel. Consequently thistooth has little wear resistance and has been hollowed out and there is an overgrowth on the opposite 406. The central image showsan enlarged, dysplastic tooth with additional enamel with additional infundibular-like structures. This dysplastic tooth causedexcessive wear on the opposing normal tooth, in contrast with the usual situation where the dysplastic tooth is softer than normal.Right: this mandibular tooth has infundibular-like structure between pulp horns 3 and 4, that developed deep caries and thus causedapical infection to develop in this tooth. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 101FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREA major role in equine dental care is to prevent large dental overgrowths from developing by their early detection duringroutine oral examinations and their effective removal. In advanced cases of dental overgrowths, affected animals may not be able to fully clear their mouth offood. Consequently, semi-permanent, \"hamster-like\" cheek swellings may occur due to the accumu-lation of brous food between the lateral aspects ofthe cheek teeth and the cheeks, with secondary peri-odontal disease. In the presence of oral pain, somehorses may also chew very slowly, make soft slurp-ing sounds when masticating forage (rather than thenormal vigorous crunching sounds). Some affectedhorses may permanently use one side of their mouthfor chewing rather than using alternative sides, orthey may hold their head in an abnormal positionwhen masticating. Affected horses may readily eatgrass or mashes but are reluctant to eat forage.Decreased food intake and inefcient food digestionand utilization may eventually occur, sometimesleading to weight loss. Long strands of forage andundigested whole cereal grains may be visible in thefeces of such cases. Paradoxically, some horseswith large amounts of undigested long forage intheir feces will have very loose feces or diarrhea. Painful dental-related lesions may also cause bit (bitting) problems, including abnormal head car-riage and headshaking during work because the\"enamel\" overgrowths on the upper cheek teeth cutthe inside of the cheeks due to bit and nosebandpressure. Less commonly, overgrowths on thelower cheek teeth may be forced against the tongueby the bit and also cause lacerations. As unopposed cheek teeth erupt abnormally fast and also have less occlusal stimulus to lay downsubocclusal secondary dentine, there is a great like-lihood that if a large cheek tooth overgrowth (e.g., a20-mm long stepmouth ) is fully reduced (floated) to the level of the remaining cheek teeth, some pulpswill be exposed. This is because insufcient second- ary dentine has developed to occlude the pulp cavity tothe level of the occlusal surfaces of adjacent teeth. 80 Treatment of these abnormalities should be a stagedremoval of major overgrowths using manual or motor-ized equipment over many months or even years, andsome do not need to be fully reduced. As noted, when there are unequal amounts of enamel in opposing teeth due to acquired diseasesuch as infundibular caries of upper teeth, dentaldisplacement, senile loss of dental enamel (smoothmouth), or even complete loss of teeth, the opposingteeth will overgrow. Following tooth loss, the op-posing tooth will erupt more rapidly, leading ini-tially to rectangular overgrowths termed stepmouththat later may become triangular in shape due todental drift into the extraction space. Treatment ofhorses with shearmouth ,wavemouth , and step- mouth is often palliative (20 years of dental neglect cannot be reversed!) and consists of extraction ofdigitally loose teeth, removal of overgrowths thatare causing soft-tissue trauma or restricting normalmasticatory movements, treating diastemata/perio-dontitis, and possibly reducing slightly loose teethby a few millimeters in the hope they can now reat-tach more rmly (Fig. 31). Such cases should havean increasing portion of their dietary forage \"pre-masticated,\" i.e., mechanically ground down (i.e.,\"senior diets\"). Very loose teeth can be extracted orally using cheek-teeth extractors in standing sedated horses.However, all loose teeth do not have to be extracted,especially in older horses, because as noted, theymay reattach when overgrowths are reduced. Theaim should be to prevent the development of suchend-stage disorders by regular (annual or biannual) Fig. 30. These images reinforce the role of cingulae (vertical ridges on the buccal aspect of maxillary cheek teeth) in causingdental-related buccal ulceration. This horse had its teeth \"routinely floated\" some days previously, during which the operator, ratherexcessively, bilaterally removed all of the occlusal aspect of these cingulae, except the caudal one on each side (arrow). These tworesidual cingulae are now taking all of the cheek pressure and thus have caused ulceration of the overlying buccal mucosa. Thishorse, which was asymptomatic prior to dental floating, now has oral pain and bitting problems! 102 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP LECTUREdental inspections and appropriate treatments in-cluding removal of any detected overgrowths,thereby encouraging normal masticatory activityand allowing the free movement of food and salivaaround the oral cavity. Older teeth may develop a (concave\u2014cupped out) occlusal surface termed \" senile excavation .\" Such abnormal wear is caused by absence of the enamelfolds due to the wearing out of the infundibularenamel (in upper cheek teeth) and of the peripheralenamel infolding (mainly in the lower cheek teeth)that normally prevents such excessive wear of theadjacent dentine. Such horses with senile denti-tion may develop sharp dental overgrowths on thecaudal aspect of the upper 11s and the palatal aspectof the maxillary cheek teeth. Smooth mouth , i.e., absence of enamel on the occlusal surface of cheekteeth, is common in older horses; however, manyothers lose their cheek teeth from secondary peri-odontal disease prior to this stage. Later, the indi-vidual roots will become exposed and may displaythe characteristic hypercementosis of aged equineteeth. 81 Primary Periodontal Disease Unlike species with brachydont teeth, primary peri-odontal disease is not a signicant problem in thehorse. 14During eruption of the permanent denti - tion, a transient inflammation of the periodontalmembrane occurs in many horses. Due to the pro-longed eruption and continuous development of newperiodontal bers in the horse, equine periodontaldisease is not necessarily irreversible, as is often thecase with brachydont dentition. Many horses willhave limited periodontal disease (gingivitis) aroundtheir canine teeth due to calculus, but rarely willthis progress to deep periodontal disease. Clini-cally signicant periodontal disease in the horse isinvariably secondary to diastema or malocclusionsas described earlier and is managed as previouslydescribed. 4. Traumatic Disorders of Oral Cavity In addition to the more common swellings caused bythe developing permanent cheek apical maxillary and more so of themandibles can also be caused by external trauma(usually due to kicks), bitting injuries (Fig. 32), andless commonly, by tumors. In the young horsetraumatic mandibular fractures will inevitablycause some damage to the cheek teeth reservecrowns, which occupy much of this bone, but theselong reserve crowns usually stabilize the mandibu-lar fracture. In most cases conservative therapy(e.g., 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy and feeding a softdiet such as soaked senior diet for 6 to 8 weeks) isadequate, with the long cheek teeth and undamagedcontralateral mandible acting as effective splints.Even if external sinus tracts do develop, it is worth-while persevering with conservative therapy, untilradiographic changes (using a metallic probe in anysinus tract) conrm the presence of denitive dentalinfection. In any case, extraction should be delayedfor some months to minimise the chance that theextraction procedure causes displacement of themandibular fracture. Iatrogenic trauma to teethand caudal mandible can also be (less common now- Fig. 31. This post-mortem image shows an example of long-termgross dental neglect. The dental disorders in this specimen in-clude loss of teeth, many large overgrowths (including so calledstepmouth), wavemouth, shearmouth (second arcade), di-astemata, peripheral caries, and periodontal disease. A majorrole of the equine veterinarian is to prevent such irreversible,long-term changes from developing. Fig. 32.

Idiopathic Fractures of Cheek Teeth Cheek-teeth fractures that are present in the ab-sence of any known trauma have been termed idio- pathic cheek teeth fractures 14and are commonly found in horses, usually affecting the upper cheekteeth. 16,82,83These fractures can run through the pulp horns in a variety of patterns. The most com-mon pattern has been termed a slab fracture that occurs through the two buccal (lateral) pulp horns(pulp horns number 1 and 2) (Fig. 33) at alveolarcrest level, with the upper 09s the most commonlyaffected Triadan positon. Mandibular cheek teethless commonly suffer from such lateral sagittal frac-tures through pulp horns 1 and 2. However, in thelower cheek teeth (that have no infundibulae), thesefractures are close to the sagittal midline of thetooth. Maxillary cheek tooth slab fracture sitesusually become lled with food, thus displacing thesmaller lateral cheek-tooth fragment bucally intothe cheeks, causing buccal periodontal ligaments, subsequentlycausing quidding and bitting problems. Spontane-ous loss (usually within a few days) or extraction ofthe smaller, loose fragment (using cheek-teeth-frag-ment forceps) usually resolves the clinical signs.However, pulpar exposure always occurs in thesecases and evidence of apical inflammation and alve-olar remodeling on imaging is often present in thesefractured teeth. In maxillary (but seldom in man-dibular) cheek teeth, the two exposed pulp hornscommonly become effectively sealed off from thefracture site by tertiary (reparative) dentine, andthe remainder of the endodontic system and frac-tured tooth remain vital and the tooth continues toerupt normally. In contrast, apical infection anddeath of the fractured tooth occurs commonly withmandibular cheek teeth pulp horn 1 and 2 frac-tures and consequently, occlusal pulpar exposurecan later be recognized in the remaining largerlingual (medial) fragment. With the death of anyremaining dental fragment, it will likely have tobe removed within a year or so when it loosens,further fractures, or causes clinical signs of apicalinfection, such as sinusitis or maxillary or man-dibular swelling. Midline (sagittal) fractures of the maxillary cheek teeth occur less commonly than slab fractures, andthe 09s are again most commonly affected. Thistype of fracture is now known to be secondary toadvanced infundibular caries as described below,with coalescence of two carious leadingto mechanical weakening of the tooth (Fig. 34), fol-lowed by fracture formation (Fig. 35). As the etiol-ogy of these fractures is known, they should nolonger be classied as Cheek Tooth Infundibular Caries Caries is characterized by decalcication and de-struction of the calcied dental tissue and destruc-tion of its organic dental components. Infundibularcaries is believed to be caused by acidogenic bacteriapresent in food that becomes impacted in infundibu-lae that have defects in their cementum (Fig. 36),thus allowing cariogenic bacteria to proliferate atthis site. The above-noted maxillary cheek toothinfundibular caries has been recognized for morethan a century, including by Colyer 35(1906) and later by Honma et al45(1962) who caries grading system, modied by Da-cre, 85which is currently the standard grading sys - tem used to classify the severity of both infundibularand peripheral caries (Fig. 37). Fig. 33. This transverse computed tomographic image throughthe 109 and 209 of a horse with idiopathic slab fractures (frac-tures though pulp horns 1 and 2) present in both of theseteeth. The 109 fracture (left in image) is asymptomatic and theoverlying pulp horn and apex show no detectable imaging abnor-malities. The 209 (right) has gas (indicative of gas producingbacterial infection) in a buccal pulp horn, widened periapicalperiodontal space, overlying sinus mucosal thickening, and soft-tissue swelling over the adjacent maxillary bone, indicating thatthe pulpar exposure was not sealed off by tertiary dentine in thistooth, with subsequent infection of these pulps that spread to theperiapical area. 104 PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREThis caries causes destruction of the remaining (of- ten porous) cementum and can possibly extend to theunderlying enamel, or even dentine and pulp. In-fundibular cemental defects are common with recentstudies showing approximately 90% of all infundibu-lae (especially in the Triadan 09 position) to be incom-pletely lled with normal-appearing cementum infundibular these infundibulae. 6 Infection of the underlying pulp and periapical aspect of the tooth commonly ensues with infundib-ular caries-related fractures and can extend tocause a secondary maxillary sinusitis ( dental sinus- itis) (Fig. 38). In the presence of clinical signs ofapical infection, all parts of the fractured tooth mustbe extracted, per os if possible, even though the clinical crown is weakened. This can best be per-formed by cleaning out the food in the fracture siteand using cheek-tooth extractors to close the twofragments together if possible, followed by gentlyrocking the combined fragments until the tooth isloose. If much concurrent periodontal disease ispresent, extraction is usually easy. If the weak-ened teeth further fracture during this procedure, itmay be possible to extract the residual fragmentsusing a variety of long-handled, specialist equinedental picks. If this technique is unsuccessful, a Fig. 34. This maxillary cheek tooth has marked caries of both rostral and caudal infundibulae (arrows), that have almost coalesced.The dark discoloration of the infundibular enamel suggests that the enamel is carious (i.e., grade 2 infundibular caries) and the brownstaining of the adjacent dentine shows that it is also carious (i.e., grade 3 infundibular caries). This tooth is now mechanically weakmidline and may fracture. Alternatively, the infundibular caries may penetrate to the pulp horn and cause apical infection. Thistooth is an ideal candidate for infundibular restoration. Fig. 35. This post-mortem image shows infundibular caries-related, 09s, with palatal andbuccal displacements of the fragments. Such cases have severe oral pain with masticatory and bitting problems and many alsodevelop dental sinusitis due to apical infection of these fractured teeth. (Image courtesy of Istvan Gere) AAEP PROCEEDINGS as described later. Cemental hypoplasia of the infundibulae of the rostral three cheek teeth could be caused by earlydestruction of the dental sac, such as by prematureremoval of overlying deciduous \"caps.\" However, arecent study of cheek teeth 1 to 3 years followingtheir eruption ( dental age ) showed a viable blood supply to the apex of infundibulae in many teeth.This alternative blood supply allows continued in-fundibular cemental deposition to occur for someyears following eruption\u2014but infundibular deposition is often incomplete, especially in the09s. 6,18Streptococcus devriesei is a recently de - scribed bacteria isolated from equine cheek teethinfundibular caries (IC) lesions but its precise role inthe aetiopathogenesis of IC remains unclear. Ithas been proposed that feeding high levels of con-centrates to horses provides a source of fermentablecarbohydrates that predisposes to infundibular car-ies, in contrast with brachydont dental caries, wheresimple sugars have been shown to be a substrate forcariogenic bacteria to produce the acids that causecaries. 88 6. Peripheral Caries Peripheral caries, an increasingly recognized or pos-sibly more prevalent disorder, can affect all of thedental calcied tissues (cementum, enamel, anddentine), and so the term peripheral caries is pref- erable to the previously used term of peripheral ce- mental caries . 20,89Examples of different grades of peripheral caries are shown in Fig. 39. The mech-anism of development of equine peripheral caries isbelieved to be similar to the development of caries inbrachydont species and has recently been re-viewed. 88Essentially, the normal organic biolm (pellicle) covering all equine teeth becomes thicker,i.e., forms a plaque with concurrent changes in thecomplex bacterial flora within this biolm, including atendency for cariogenic bacteria to proliferate and fer-ment simple carbohydrates to produce acids that de-mineralize the underlying cementum. In moresevere cases, the underlying enamel or even dentineare affected, predisposing these teeth to prematurewear or fracture. By removing interproximal cemen-tum, peripheral caries creates spaces between theteeth and thus may predispose to diastema and sec-ondary periodontal disease but the etiological relation-ship between cheek teeth peripheral caries anddiastemata remains contentious. Peripheral caries most commonly affects the cau- dal three cheek teeth (Triadan 09-11). It has beensuggested that because salivary ducts drain rostrally inthe mouth, that the buffering effect of saliva on oralpH may be less in the caudal aspect of the equineoral cavity (Gere and Dixon 90). The prevalence of equine peripheral caries seems to be increasing in Europe, usually grade 1, i.e.,affecting peripheral cementum only. Wafa 48re- corded a peripheral caries in apost-mortem study in Ireland; a 0.9% prevalencewas found in a 1990 dental survey in Swedish hors-es; 91but a Swedish post-mortem study 20 years later reported a prevalence of 6.1%.90A clinical survey of donkeys in Spain and Portugal showed asimilar prevalence of 5.9%. 92In contrast, a very recent United Kingdom-wide clinical survey hasshown a much higher prevalence (52%) than all pre-vious studies. 93It is unclear whether this high prev - alence is partly due to increased recognition of thisdisorder or is due to a true increase in prevalence.The Swedish study suggested that the feeding ofhaylage and higher levels of concentrates predis-posed to peripheral caries; 90however, a large epide - miological survey did not show any clearcutrelationship between diet and the prevalence of pe-ripheral caries. 93 Fig. 36. This longitudinal section of a young maxillary cheektooth shows one of its two infundibulae sectioned over its fulldepth. There is an area of complete cemental aplasia toward theinfundibular apex (red arrow) with some dark porous,hypoplastic cementum more occlusally to this. More centrally,the lled with normal-appearing ce-mentum there is a small carious in-fundibular cemental defect open to the oral cavity (yellowarrow). These hypoplastic cemental defects and localized occlu-sal caries lesions MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTURESevere peripheral dental caries involving all classes of teeth (incisors, canine, and cheek teeth)have been found in some groups of horses fed high-concentrate, low-roughage diets, where the reducedtime spent masticating high levels of more ferment-able, simple carbohydrates may predispose to pro-longed periods of low oral-cavity pH that causesdemineralization of calcied dental tissue. Individ-ual horses may be susceptible to this disorder.Peripheral caries is also concurrently found withother dental abnormalities where restricted foodand saliva movement may predispose to its develop-ment. Extensive generalized damage to teeth not induced by acids produced by oral bacteria i.e., den- Fig. 37. Grading system for equine infundibular caries.

Cheek Teeth Periapical (Apical) Infections Bacterial infections of the periodontal tissues of thecheek-teeth apices (true roots may not be formed atthis time) are a very signicant problem becausethey commonly cause osteomyelitis of the support-ing bones or sinusitis. This is because the apicalinfections commonly occur in younger horses thathave long reserve crowns and thus the infectioncannot drain into the oral cavity, as occurs in olderhorses with shorter reserve crowns. Consequently,the infection spreads to the adjacent bony struc-tures. Mandibular apical in youngerhorses are inevitably accompanied by unilateral,painful mandibular swellings, often with external draining tracts. Infections of the upper 06s and 07s(occasionally the 08s) will cause focal swellings of therostral maxilla, which are almost pathognomonic fordental infections (Fig. 40). An external sinus tractwill develop in some cases; less commonly, exudatewill drain into the nasal cavity causing a chronic, uni-lateral, purulent infection. Infections of the caudal three to four maxillary cheek teeth generally resultsin a secondary sinusitis, with the presence of achronic, malodorous, unilateral nasal discharge. 57 In older horses, apical infections may just drain through the periodontal membrane or occlusallyopen pulp horns into the mouth, and therefore clin-ical signs of infection of the supporting jaws willusually not occur. Apical infections that arise as anextension of deep periodontal disease from abnormalspaces surrounding the cheek teeth including super-numerary teeth, diastemata, developmental, and ac-quired dental displacements will obviously draininto the mouth via this periodontal route. Less fre-quent signs with cheek teeth apical infections arequidding, halitosis, and epiphora if the nasolacrimalduct becomes obstructed. If an apical infection (with death of some or all pulp horns) has been present for very many months,the secondary dentine that is worn away on theocclusal surface by normal attrition cannot be re-placed. Dental eruption continues in apically in-fected teeth due to normal periodontal remodellingeven if the tooth is endodontically dead and so oc- Fig. 39. Grading system for equine peripheral caries.

Infection of the cheek-teeth apices can occur through a variety of routes, including deep periodon-tal disease, midline sagittal or dysplasia. 20,87,95However, apical cheek teeth is most commonly caused by blood- orlymphatic-borne infections (anachoresis) and in-flammation of the pulp due to dental impaction maypredispose to such infections. Periapical abscessa-tion of the lower cheek teeth (possibly bilateral)believed to be caused by anachoresis commonly oc-curs within 1 to 2 years of eruption and may occurwith or following the development of eruption cysts(\"3- and 4-year-old bumps\") (Fig. 41). Cheek-teeth occlusal hairline or fractures (usually transversely oriented), are a potentialcause of apical infections, particularly if darklystained and close to a pulp horn. If these criteriaare not met, they are usually believed to be aetio-logically insignicant and two large oral endoscopicstudies have not found any direct association be-tween this type of fracture and apical infection. 96,97Another possible cause of apical infection of the up-per cheek teeth only, are food accumulation andfermentation deep in cemental defects(infundibular caries) leading to caries of enamel anddentine then spread of infection to the adjacentpulp horns. 25,87As noted, infundibular caries can also a midline sagittal fracture with apical infectioncommonly occurring in these fractured teeth. 14 Diagnosis of Cheek Teeth Apical Infection A thorough clinical (including intra-oral examina-tion with a mouth gag, including for the presence offractures or pulpar exposure) and radiographic eval-uation of the dental (latero-oblique projec-tions) should always be undertaken rst toabsolutely conrm that a tooth needs to be extractedand then to conrm which tooth is diseased (Figs. 40, 42, and 43). The interpretation of equine dentalradiographs can be difcult and consequently theyare often inaccurate in the diagnosis of early cheek-teeth apical infection. In such cases, advanced im-aging, especially computed tomography, can provideconclusive evidence of apical infection (Fig. 44).If an external sinus track is present, e.g., as occurswith many mandibular or rostral (rst to third)maxillary cheek-teeth infections, it is essential toobtain radiographs with a metallic probe in situ,t o Fig. 40. This image shows a horse with a chronic sinus tract just dorsal to the rostral aspect of its left facial crest (a pathognomonic site for dental related swellings/tracts). The radiograph of this case was taken with a metal cannula inserted into this tract. This probe leadsto an area between the 208 and 209, both which have gross destruction of their apices and some reactive cementum deposition. It is notclear whether a very destructive infection of one apex damaged its alveolus and led to an apical infection of an adjacent tooth. Fig. 41. These two mandibular 08 cheek teeth were extracted from a 5-year-old pony with bilateral mandibular swellings. Bothteeth have pulpar exposure (see needles in occlusal aspect of pulp horns) and small apical granulomas (right image). In the absenceof any clinical crown fracture or periodontal lesions of these teeth, the etiology of these apical infections was considered to be a verticalimpaction of these teeth with secondary anachoretic infection of the pulps and large eruption cysts. /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 109FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREdene the infected area of the tooth (Fig. 40). Thisprocedure will also provide surgical landmarks, if aloose infected tooth is to be extracted by Steinman-pin repulsion. Similarly, metallic markers (e.g.,skin staples) should be placed over areas of maximalfacial swelling to establish possible anatomical rela-tionships between facial swellings the infections, of the nasal cavity should Fig. 42. Radiographs are often unreliable in detecting earlycheek teeth apical infections. However, some chronic cases ofapical infection do have conclusive radiographic evidence of suchdisease, including this case that has blunting of the roots of anapically infected tooth, and a lucent periapical area surroundedby a diffuse, radiopaque alveolar area. Note that the crown ofthis tooth looks more radiolucent than adjacent teeth. However,such radiolucency can be a feature of clinically normal maxillary09s because they often have infundibular cemental defects andpossibly later, infundibular caries. Fig. 43. This radiograph shows the apical region of a maxillary cheek tooth with advanced apical infection, as evidenced bydestruction of the normal apical and alveolar architecture and much reactive cementum deposition. On the right, the extracted toothshows gross reactive hypercementosis of its infected apex\u2014a feature that can make exodontia very difcult. Fig. 44. This computed tomographic image shows a horse with right- sided dental sinusitis. There is apical infection of the underlying max-illary cheek tooth as manifested by a large amount of gas in its buccalpulp horn, lysis, and fragmentation of a buccal root and destruction ofthe overlying alveolus. This and dorsal conchal sinuses all becoming infectedand they are now lled with pus, some which is inspissated, as indi-cated by the presence of gas (black dots) in some of the exudate. 110 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREalso be performed to assess whether there is drain-age of exudate from the sinonasal ostium. Thisendoscopy should also include careful examinationof the middle nasal meatus for the presence sinuses. Sinoscopy often helpful, given that it may possiblydemonstrate normal alveoli and so suggesting thatthe sinusitis present is not of dental origin. Thegoal of these examinations is to denitively conrmwhether any of the cheek teeth are diseased andneed to be extracted. Treatment In the early stages, an anachoretic infection mayremain conned to the apical periodontal area, andall the pulp horns (or the common pulp in immaturecheek teeth) may remain vital. At this early stageof infection, antibiotic treatment (e.g., 2 weeks ofantibiotics effective against anaerobic bacteria) maybe effective, but no factual data are available on theefcacy of such antimicrobial therapy. Surgical cu-rettage of the affected apex has also been used but ifcurettage damages the apical blood supply of thetooth it will denitely cause dental death and laterpulp exposure, and possibly fracture of the tooth. In longer-standing periapical infections, extrac- tion (or endodontic treatment) of the affected tooth isrequired to resolve the clinical signs. Extraction ofthe long crowned (hypsodont) equine cheek teeth is amajor surgical procedure with many possible imme-diate and delayed sequel. As noted, radiographicconrmation of the presence of cheek-teeth apicalinfection can be difcult and if any doubt remainsconcerning whether a cheek tooth is infected or not,conservative treatment and not extraction should beperformed. These include antibiotic therapy forsuspect mandibular (09-11) maxil-lary cheek teeth apical infections. Failure to re-spond to the above conservative therapy shouldprompt a further clinical, radiographic, and wherepossible, computed radiographic evaluation for den-tal infection and progression of imaging changes canbe helpful. Only when denite evidence of dentalinfection is present should dental extraction beperformed. 100 8. Extraction of Equine Cheek TeethLocal Anesthesia Maxillary of the trigeminal nerve, whichis sensory to all maxillary teeth, can be anesthetizedmost readily and with least complications by inject-ing local anesthetic into the extraperiorbital fat bodyin the pterygopalatine fossa and allowing it to to the maxillary branch of the trigeminalnerve. 101Following aseptic skin preparation be - neath the caudal aspect of the orbit, a 5-cm needle isinserted immediately ventral to the zygomatic pro-cess between the middle third and caudal third of Fig. 45. Steinmann pin repulsion of a carious maxillary cheek tooth whose clinical crown fractured during extraction. The top imageon the left shows the affected horses with a row of 18-gauge hypodermic needles inserted subcutaneously level with the estimated siteof the fractured tooth. The radiographs (bottom left image) shows that these needles are a little too caudal in position and are alsodirected too caudally. The radiograph on the right, taken during the Steinman pin repulsion of the tooth, shows the pin to be properlypositioned and appropriately angled. Note the loss of the clinical crown of this tooth (arrow). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 111FRANK J. MILNE STATE-OF-THE-ART LECTUREthe orbit. The needle is directed in a rostro-medio-ventral direction and inserted 30-35 mm throughthe masseter muscle. A decrease in resistance isthen detected as it enters the extraperiorbital fatbody. The needle is advanced 15-20 mm furtherand 20 ml of local anesthetic is inserted. It maytake 20 minutes or so for the maxillary nerve tobecome anesthetized. This procedure Alveolar alveolar nerve, which is sensory to allmandibular teeth, can be anesthetized as it entersthe mandibular canal via the mandibular foramenon the medial aspect of the ramus of the mandible.This procedure is usually performed by insertion of along needle up the medial aspect of the mandiblebeneath the ptergyoideus muscles to the intersec-tions of lines drawn perpendicular to the lateralcanthus and level with the occlusal aspect of the man-dibular cheek teeth. A recently described techniqueuses a specialized instrument to perform this proce-dure per os . 102If excessive volumes of local anaes - thetic are used or if the local anaesthetic is depositedtoo far dorsally, the lingual nerves can be anaesthe-tised and the horse can cause marked tongue selftrauma, especially if allowed to eat before the tongueanaesthesia wears off, and particularly so if bilateralmandibular blocks have been performed. Repulsion The traditional method for extracting equine cheekteeth has been by repulsion of the diseased toothunder general anaesthesia. This procedure carriesall of the inherent expense and risks of generalanaesthesia and additionally is associated with ahigh level of postoperative complications. This isbecause much damage occurs to the local alveolarand supporting mandibular or maxillary bones dur-ing repulsion and the punch usually fractures thediseased apex of the infected tooth, often leavingapical fragments attached to the alveolus. Somestudies have shown that more than 50% of cases ofequine dental repulsion will require a second sur- Fig. 46. Minimally invasive transbuccal extraction of a maxil-lary tooth with a clinical crown fracture. A long elevator hasbeen inserted through a trans-buccal cannula into the oral cavityand is directed under oral endoscopic guidance into the periodon-tal space around the diseased tooth. It can then be driven intothis space in a controlled manner using a mallet, thus looseningthe tooth. The black markings on the pony's face overlie thebuccal branches of the facial nerve. Fig. 47. Minimally invasive transbuccal extraction. Having loosened the affected tooth sufciently, a solid part of the tooth is thendrilled using a long, toughened drill bit inserted through the buccal cannula (left image is an intra-oral view of drilling of a fracturedtooth). The drill hole is then tapped and a long bolt is screwed into the tooth transbuccally to allow further loosening of the tooth.The bolt is then used to withdraw the tooth from the alveolus into the oral cavity, where it is detached from the screw.112 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSFRANK J. or alveolarsequestrae from infected, nonhealing alveoli. 57 Repulsion is no longer acceptable as a routine tech-nique for equine dental extraction. Lateral Buccotomy Technique This technique involves a lateral surgical approachdirectly through the skin, subcutaneous tissues, andalveolar wall under general anaesthesia. In addi-tion to anaesthesia, it carries risks ofmarked dehis-cence, facial nerve paralysis, and parotid stula-tion. 100This technique should also not be routinely used for extraction, except possibly for cases ofchronically infected cheek teeth that have developedlarge reactive cemental deposits over their apices(Fig. 41). Such apices with hypercementosis maybecome wider than the alveolus and so cannot beorally extracted. Alternatively, to extract suchteeth with such expanded apices, an appropriatewindow can be made over the apex that is the re-duced in size with a burr to allow oral extraction. Repulsion or the lateral buccotomy technique are no longer acceptable as routine equine dental extraction techiniques. Oral Extraction of Cheek Teeth This technique has the great advantage of being per-formed in the standing horse, and so removes the ex-pense and risk of general anesthesia. Additionally, itdoes not require surgery of the supporting bones andconsequently, postoperative complications are less com-mon than with more invasive exodontia techniques.The current availability of safe and effective sedativesand analgesics has been a major reason for the revival ofthe oral extraction technique, because the instrumenta-tion has barely changed in over 100 years. In addition,local anaesthesia of the mandibular 102, maxillary, or in - fraorbital nerves can also be used and the horse shouldbe restrained in stocks and the head supported on aheadstand or a head sling.Extraction of Fractured Teeth If the clinical crown is too damaged for oral extrac-tion, or fractures during exodontia, extraction withfragment forceps may be possible. If enough crownis not present, and the tooth remnant is relativelyloose it may be possible to extract it using special-ized equine dental picks with varying head angula-tion and interchangeable heads. 103More rmly attached dental fragments can be repulsed by use ofa Steinman pin whose diameter needs to be in-versely proportionate to the looseness of the dentalfragment (Fig. 45). The recently developed, mini-mally invasive transbuccal extraction technique\u2014using a small trocar through the cheek, having rstidentied the buccal nerves, and facial vasculatureand catheterized the parotid duct, has proven to bevery useful. The tooth is loosened with elevatorsinserted through the cannula and the use of a mal-let. It is then drilled and extracted into the oralcavity using long drills and a long screw inserted viathe cannula before being unwound from the screwand extracted per os (Figs. 46 and 47). In some infected teeth with a clinical crown fracture, theadjacent teeth drift toward it more occlusally and soprevent the (larger) reserve crown from being ex-tracted. With such cases, a long motorized bur canbe used to section the wider reserve crown and re-move it piecemeal in the standing horse. Endodontics A number of workers have attempted to treat infectedcheek teeth by use of endodontics (root canal therapy),which is complicated in horses by the length and multi- ple age-related and sometimes otherwise variablebranching of the ve to seven pulp horns in each cheek tooth. A major advantage of endodontics, if successful,is that the infected tooth is preserved and thus will thencontinue to erupt normally (at circa 2-3 mm/year).This prevents the development of overgrowths of theopposing cheek tooth and also \"drifting\" of the adjacentcheek teeth into the site of the extracted tooth. 104,105 This latter \"drifting\" will eventually cause over- Fig. 48. The intraoperative image on the left shows a large osteosarcoma of the left mandible, previously diagnosed by a bone biopsy.On the right, the affected section of mandible is being completely resected. Bone plates were then used to stabilize the remainingmandible (with support from the contra-lateral mandible), which later healed slowly with a bro-osseous union. PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 the and rostral aspect of theopposing cheek teeth row. Endodontic treatment can be performed through the apex of the tooth ( retrograde endodontics ), i.e., via surgical approaches through the mandibular ormaxillary bones and via the apical aspects of thepulps, that requires general anesthesia\u2014but thistechnique has shown poor long-term success. 106 More recently, endodontic approaches through theocclusal surface ( orthograde endodontics ) in ing horses has shown much more encouraging re-sults. 107A further novel treatment is to orally extract the affected tooth, immediately resect itsapex, and then perform very thorough endodontictreatment from both its occlusal and apical aspectsand re-implant studies on orthograde endodontics and re-implantation have not yet been published. 9. Oral Tumors Dental tumors can include noncalcied epithelialtumors (which are derived from the epithelium thatforms enamel) which are termed ameloblastomas.They can also include a wide variety of calciedtumors from dentinal tissues (odontoma) or cement(cementoma) or combinations of all three dentalcomponents (compound odontoma or ameloblasticodontoma). 70These usually present as slowly growing, hard, and usually painless focal mandibularor maxillary masses that are usually very radiodense.Depending on their size, these calcied dental tumorscan usually be surgically removed and carry a goodprognosis. Many types of tumors affect the support-ing bones of the jaws including benign and malignantprimary bone tumors (Fig. 48). A specic bro-osse-ous growth of the rostral mandibular injury in youngerhorses has been previously noted. Benign gingival growths such as different types of epu- lis, are common in other species but are rare in the horse.Squamous-cell carcinomas are the most common soft-tissue neoplasm of the equine oral cavity; they can occurat any site but have a predilection for the lateral mar- gin of the hard palate adjacent to the caudal cheekteeth. At this site they may invade dorsally caus-ing nasal or sinus neoplasia with secondary infec-tion and looseness of the adjacent teeth. Suchinvasion is often very extensive before it is de-tected and complete surgical section is seldom pos-sible. Radiotherapy, if available may be of value. A wide range of other soft-tissue neoplasms may also occur as described by Knottenbelt and Kelly. 70 The prognosis depends on their size and how welldened they are to allow surgical excision, with gen-erally a poor prognosis for advanced oral region softtissue tumors.

Introduction At its most basic level, normal reproductive behaviorthat leads to mating and the successful production ofoffspring is essential for the preservation/perpetua-tion of all animal species. For free-roaming horses,social behavior and reproductive behavior are inex-tricably related, and both drive the day-to-day inter-actions among horses living in close proximity. 1 In contrast, the social and reproductive behavior ofdomestic horses are both heavily influenced by nu-merous management factors imposed on them. 2 For mares in performance settings, reproductive be-havior is often viewed with disdain, ranging from acharacteristic that is considered a simple annoy-ance, to behavior that, whether real or perceived,seriously impedes the ability of a mare to perform as intended. Because of that, it is common toattempt to control/eliminate normal reproductivebehavior. 3The objectives of this review are to: 1) provide an overview of the hormonal basis forreproductive behavior in nonpregnant mares, andto put seasonal changes in the reproductive statusof a mare and its attendant behavior into contextthat will aid the assessment of whether reproduc-tive behavior is affecting a mare's performanceactivities; and 2) briefly discuss treatment optionsfor managing problematic reproductive behaviorin mares. 2. Terminology For this discussion, a brief review of the terms usedto describe various reproductive events/states in themare is warranted. The mare is dened as a long-day, seasonally polyestrous breeder. As a result ofchanging day length over the course of the calendaryear, a nonpregnant mare will generally be in one offour reproductive states: 1) a noncycling, anovula-tory state during the short days of winter, 2) anovulatory state (i.e., \"cycling\") during the long daysof the late spring and summer, 3) a spring \"transi-tional\" phase between the winter anovulatory andsummer ovulatory states, or 4) a fall \"transitional\"phase between the summer ovulatory and winteranovulatory states. By denition, winter anovulatory and spring tran- sitional mares are not \"cycling.\" In contrast, begin-ning in the late spring and continuing through thesummer and into early fall, a normal nonpregnantmare should have repeating estrous cycles, each en-compassing one interovulatory interval of approxi-mately 21-22 days. Each estrous cycle is composedof a period of estrus (i.e., \"heat\") lasting approxi-mately 1 week and a period of diestrus lasting ap- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 117THE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MARE NOTESproximately 2 weeks during which time the mare isout of \"heat.\" Estrus denes the period of timewhen the mare is sexually receptive to the stallion(i.e., will allow mating) and diestrus denes theperiod of time when the mare is overtly antagonisticto the stallion (i.e., refuses mating attempts). Es-trous behavior refers to the signs displayed by amare in estrus, whereas diestrous behavior refers tothe signs displayed by a mare in diestrus. Theclinical signs and hormonal basis for estrous behav-ior and diestrous behavior will be discussed later.In contrast with a cycling mare, a typical winteranovulatory mare is generally ambivalent in re-sponse to the presence of a stallion (i.e., neithershowing signs of estrus or diestrus), although impor-tantly as will be discussed later, some anovulatorymares display what is referred to as \"paradoxical\" or\"unseasonable\" estrous behavior that has importantimplications for assessing and managing reproduc-tive behavior in performance mares. Of the twotransitional phases, the spring transition is partic-ularly relevant, due to the characteristic nature ofreproductive behavior these mares exhibit, whichwill be discussed later. 3. Reproductive Physiology Like other mammals, most reproductive processes in themare, including behavior, are primarily, although notexclusively, regulated by the hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-ovarian axis. During the winter anovu-latory period, the hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-ovarian axis is in a relatively quiescent/inactivestate, whereas during the summer ovulatory periodit has peak activity. During the spring and falltransitional phases, activity of the hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-ovarian axis is on an increasingand decreasing plane, respectively. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secreted from the neurons of pituitary gland, both of which act systemi-cally to regulate ovarian activity. FSH promotesgrowth of ovarian follicles, whereas LH induces mat-uration and ovulation of a dominant preovulatoryfollicle(s), which results in the formation of a corpusluteum (CL). The principle ovarian steroid hor-mones, estrogen produced by follicles and progester-one produced by the CL, are the predominanthormones regulating reproductive behavior, and assuch, will be a major focus of this review. Anotherhormone integrally involved in the regulation of re-production in the cycling nonpregnant mare is pros-taglandin F2 /H9251(PGF2 /H9251), which is secreted the the uterus. Secretion of PGF2 /H9251 causes luteolysis, the process through which CL (i.e., progesterone secretion) ceases.As such PGF2 /H9251is responsible for ending one estrous cycle and initiating the subsequent cycle.4. Seasonality of Reproduction During the shortest days of the year (December andJanuary in the Northern Hemisphere), 85-90% ofnonpregnant mares are in the winter anovulatory phase associated with quiescence of the hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-ovarian axis. Clinically, thesemares have small, rm ovaries with follicles /H1102120 mm, and an atonic, flaccid uterus and cervix. Al-though the winter anovulatory phase is often re-ferred to as \"winter anestrus,\" that term is amisnomer given that some seasonally anovulatory(as well as some ovariectomized) mares will exhibit\"paradoxical\" or \"unseasonable\" estrous behaviorthat hormones cortex. 4,5The intensity of this \"false\" estrous behavior has been judged to be equivalent to thebehavior that cycling mares display during the ini-tial and terminal days of estrus, but less intensethan the behavior displayed near ovulation. 4Such behavioral receptivity to a stallion outside the ovulatoryseason that is independent of the hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-ovarian axis may have developedas a means of maintaining social bonds between aharem stallion and his mares. 4,6This phenomenon has important implications for how to manage es-trous behavior in performance horses that will bediscussed later. Importantly, approximately 10-15% of mares will continue to have regular estrouscycles through the winter, with signs of estrous be-havior and the hormones controlling it the same as acycling mare when the days are long. As day length increases during the late winter/early spring (February and March in the Northern Hemi-sphere), mares go through a spring \"transitional\"phase associated a progressive increase in ovarian follicularactivity that ultimately leads to the development ofone to three anovulatory follicular waves typied bythe formation of a large ( /H1102238 mm) dominant follicle that fails to ovulate due to insufcient levels ofLH. 7,8The waxing and waning of follicular growth during the spring transition is associated with irreg-ular and/or prolonged periods of estrous behavior,which is a hallmark of the spring transition. OnceLH levels in the anterior pituitary gland have in-creased sufciently, 7,9GnRH can cause a LH surge resulting in the rst ovulation of the year which, bydenition, marks the end of the spring transitionalperiod and the start of the ovulatory season. During the late spring and summer (April through September/October in the Northern Hemisphere),nonpregnant mares should be having regular es-trous cycles. As noted previously, during thecourse of one complete estrous cycle mares will be inestrus for approximately 7 days. Estrus is charac-terized by growth of a dominant follicle at a rate of3-5 mm/day until it (gen- 118 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MAREerally /H1102240 mm) and ovulates. The event of ovula- tion leads to the transformation (i.e., luteinization)of the follicular cells into a functional CL that beginssecreting progesterone. Mares continue to showsigns of estrus for 24-48 hours after ovulation,which corresponds with the length of time it takesfor progesterone levels to rise high enough to blockestrous behavior. The CL and its attendant pro-duction of progesterone keeps the mare in diestrusfor approximately 14-16 days. It is important tonote that during ( there- fore, the presence of a dominant, preovulatory-sizefollicle by itself is not indicative that a mare is inestrus. 10In nonpregnant mares, CL function ceases after approximately 2 weeks as a result of the luteo-lytic effect of PGF2 /H9251secretion from the endome- trium, which brings the mare back into estrus of thenew estrous cycle. When day length decreases during the late summer and early fall, the hypothalamic-anteriorpituitary-ovarian axis again becomes quiescent asmares enter the winter anovulatory phase. The falltransitional period is marked by increasingly irreg-ular ovulatory activity that may be associated withspontaneously prolonged CL function (i.e., pro-longed diestrus), which is followed by the completecessation of ovulatory activity. 11,12 5. Hormonal Basis for Signs of Reproductive Behavior Reproductive behavior in cycling nonpregnant mares ispredominantly regulated by changing levels of theovarian steroid hormones estrogen (from follicles) andprogesterone (from a CL), which can have synergisticor antagonistic effects. For example, estrogen stim- ulates the formation of progesterone receptors(synergistic effect), whereas progesterone can down-regulate estrogen receptors (antagonistic ef-fect). 13Of the two hormones, progesterone is the dominant hormone; a phenomenon readily demon-strated by the concurrent administration of bothhormones to seasonally anovulatory or ovariecto-mized mares, which results in predominantly pro-gestational effects. 14,15 During estrus, the progesterone concentration is at its lowest level, which has a permissive effect\"allowing\" estrogen of follicular origin to exert itseffects physiologically and behaviorally. Estrogenpromotes signs of estrous behavior that includestanding still with a base-wide stance of the hindlimbs, leaning toward stallion (or other stimulus),tail raised in a relaxed motion and held to one side,facial muscles and ears relaxed, and passing smallamounts of urine frequently in association witheversion (\"winking\") of the clitoris. 6In contrast, during diestrus and under the influence of proges-terone, signs of diestrous behavior are displayedthat include constant, agitated movement andswitching of the tail; tense facial muscles with earspinned back; may aggressively bite, strike, and/orkick forcefully squirt urine; andmay vocalize antagonistically toward stallion. 6 In addition to their effects on mare behavior, estrogen and progesterone profoundly affect thephysical (i.e., transrectally palpable) and ultrasono-graphic characteristics of the tubular genitalia.During estrus, the lack of progesterone allows estro-gen to promote the development of endometrial (i.e.,uterine) edema that can be readily appreciated withtransrectal ultrasonography (Fig. 1) and gives theuterus and cervix a soft, \"doughy\" consistency.In contrast, during diestrus under the influence ofprogesterone, there is a lack of endometrial edemathat can be readily appreciated with transrectal ul-trasonography (Fig. 2) and gives the uterus andcervix a tight, toned consistency. Given the accu-racy of ultrasonographic assessment of the presenceor absence of uterine edema, it essentially serves asa reliable bioassay that is indicative of the hormonalstate of the mare. As such, determining the pres-ence or absence of uterine edema serves as an indi-rect method of estrous detection (i.e., uterine edemain conjunction with a soft, doughy uterus/cervix isindicative of the hormonal state of estrus and theabsence of uterine edema in conjunction with atight, toned uterus/cervix is indicative of the hor-monal state of diestrus), and its use in that man-ner for mare breeding management is a commonpractice. 6. Assessing Whether Reproductive Behavior isAffecting Performance Activity Based on a survey completed by over 750 veterinar-ians, Jorgensen et al 16reported that approximately Fig. 1. Ultrasonographic image of the uterine horn of a mare inwhich endometrial edema is evident /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 119THE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MARE90% of the veterinarians had the clinical impressionthat the estrous cycle affected the performance ofmares. The most frequently reported clinical signassociated with an effect of the estrous cycle onperformance was attitude change. Other signs in-cluded tail swishing, difculty training, squealing,\"horsing,\" excess urination, kicking, and a decreasein performance. It is evident this list includes be-haviors associated with both estrus and diestrus. In addition, it is important to note that some prob-lematic behaviors displayed by mares that arethought to be associated with estrus are in fact notestrous behaviors, but signs of 1) submissive behav-ior, 2) urogenital discomfort, or 3) stallion-like be-havior. 17,18Of these, submissive behavior may be most easily confused with estrous behavior. Sub-missive behavior includes leaning away from per-ceived threats, swishing/ringing the tail, andactively squirting urine, which collectively can givethe impression of estrus. 18In contrast with sub - missive behavior, as noted previously, true estrousbehavior includes leaning toward the stallion (orother stimulus), relaxed lifting motion of the tail,stationary/squatting stance, and passive urination(full stream or small amounts in spurts). In an effort to evaluate the potential for an effect of stage of estrous cycle on the behavior of mares,Hedberg et al 19conducted two behavior tests (novel object and isolation) on 12 mares, once when theywere in estrus and once during diestrus in a cross-over design. Five of the mares served as controls,whereas the other seven mares were classied as\"problem\" mares based on their owner's perceptionof estrous-related behavioral problems. Therewere no signicant differences in the behavioral re-sponses between estrus and diestrus within the control and \"problem\" groups, nor were there differ-ences in the behavioral responses between the twogroups of horses; however, as the author's note, thesample size was small and a crossover study designmay not have been the most appropriate experimen-tal design. Therefore, further work in this area iswarranted. Although it has not been conclusively documented in the mare, it is plausible that changing levels ofestrogen and progesterone throughout the estrouscycle may influence nonreproductive body systems,such as the musculoskeletal system, as such effectshave been observed in women throughout the men-strual cycle. 20If estrogen and progesterone have differing effects on the musculoskeletal system inmares, it is plausible that a subtle lameness could beexacerbated at specic times during the estrous cy-cle and hence be an underlying reason for varyingperformance in a cycling mare. Clearly, this is anarea that warrants further investigation. When evaluating an owner/trainer complaint of an estrous cycle-related behavior/performance prob-lem in a mare, the veterinarian should rst deter-mine whether the problematic behavior is or is notrelated to the reproductive status of the mare.First and foremost, a complete physical examinationshould be performed to assess whether a nonrepro-ductive medical condition could be the underlyingcause of the problematic behavior. If no contribut-ing medical condition is identied, a careful assess-ment of the mare's current and ongoing reproductivestatus is warranted in conjunction with careful recordkeeping by the owner/trainer in an effort tocorrelate the problematic behavior with specic/re-peatable reproductive events/status over time. An initial thorough transrectal reproductive exami- nation should be performed to determine the palpableand ultrasonographic status/ characteristics of the en- tire reproductive tract. Table 1 summarizes thetypical characteristics of the reproductive tract as-sociated with each seasonal phase of reproduction throughout the year. Based upon the physical/ultrasonographic characteristics the seasonal statusof the mare should be evident. If there is doubt, afollowup examination(s) can be performed. If themare is not cycling, the problematic behavior wouldnot be expected to occur in a \"cyclic\" manner. Incontrast, if the mare is cycling, it becomes necessaryto track the mare's reproductive status serially overtime (i.e., over the course of one or more estrouscycles). Ideally, this involves monitoring the marewith transrectal palpation/ultrasonography a mini-mum of two to three times/week for 3-4 weeks toensure the mare is monitored through one completeestrous cycle. Because the presence/absence ofuterine edema is an accurate indicator of the hor-monal status of a normal cycling mare, the use ofendocrine testing for progesterone and estrogen may Fig. 2. Ultrasonographic image of the uterine horn of a marewithout endometrial edema, which results in 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MAREnot provide any further diagnostic information; how-ever, hormone levels (particularly progesterone) canbe determined over time to have truly quantitativedata. When monitoring the reproductive activity of a cycling mare, it is important to consider that somemares experience pain in the peri-ovulatory period,that ranges from 1) increased sensitivity/pain dur-ing manual transrectal evaluation of the ovary, 2)sensitivity to weight and/or manipulation of theback, and 3) overt colic-like symptoms of pain. 20-23 Of these, sensitivity during manual evaluation ofthe ovary is most common and does not warranttherapy or other intervention, given that it onlyoccurs during transrectal manipulation of the ovu-latory ovary. In contrast, mares that experienceback pain and/or colic-like symptoms in the peri-ovulatory period may benet from the use of ovula-tory agents to reduce the time a large pre-ovulatoryfollicle is present on the ovary or they may benetfrom suppression of cyclical reproductive activity. If serial examination of the reproductive tract de- nitively identies a particular reproductive state/hormonal status consistently correlates with prob-lematic behavior, an appropriate course of action would be to pursue therapy that either: 1) blocks/inhibits the causative reproductive state/hormonalstatus and/or 2) mimics the reproductive state/hor-monal status when the problematic behavior is not observed. Treatment options that are available formimicking diestrus; prolonging diestrus; inducing are summarizedin Table 2. Because most treatment options in-volve the use of exogenous hormones, steps shouldbe taken to ensure proper handling for the safety ofall personnel involved with their use. 34Although the use of an intrauterine glass ball (i.e., marble) toprolong diestrus is included in Table 2, it should benoted that their use has been called into question byrecent reports of extremely deleterious reproductiveconsequences associated with them. 35Regarding the use of diestrus, efcacious contrast, the following progestin for-mulations have been shown lack efcacy: me-droxyprogesterone acetate, hydroxyprogesteronecaproate, melengestrol acetate, norgestomet, andvarious cattle implants containing progesterone. 3 Therefore, it behooves the practitioner to use anevidence-based approach when attempting to regu-late reproductive behavior. 7. Summary Complaints and concerns about reproductive behav-ior interfering with performance activities in maresare common. Ideally, a careful and complete as-sessment of a mare's reproductive state/hormonalstatus (over time) should be performed to clini-cally determine whether there is a denitive, re-peatable relationship between the reproductiveTable 1.

Introduction In practice, clinicians are commonly presented withmares reportedly behaving badly, either persis-tently or at regular or irregular intervals. This isoften presumed by the owners and/or riders to be dueto estrous behavior or due to their mare's reproductivehormone balance. Undesirable behaviors are variedand include the following: an unwillingness to re-spond to rider instruction or signals, bucking, rear- ing, overt reproductive behaviors, aggression, andstallion-like behavior. 1-4It is assumed that when considering these behavioral problems, the behaviorin question has been conrmed by the clinician to betemporarily associated with the estrus cycle be thatestrus or diestrus, or with ovarian pain and notmusculoskeletal, soft tissue, gastric, or dental pain.The question must also be rened to exclude thosebehavioral issues experienced due to the presence of agranulosa cell tumor 3or any other hormonally active neoplasia of the ovary.5,6These criteria dene the population of mares for the question: can ovariec-tomy on grounds of behavior be justied? The ques-tion is not an ethical one, rather whether or notbehavior can be improved with surgical ovariectomy. 2. Search Strategy The question forming the title of this presentationwas rst asked in 2014 as a critical appraisal of theavailable evidence and was published in Equine Vet- erinary the University (www.liv.ac.uk.ezproxy.liv.ac.uk/library) and the International Veterinary InformationService (http://www.ivis.org). The search terms were\"ovariectomy\" AND \"mare\" AND \"behaviour.\" Hand searching of references in all articles identied, andthose within the author's knowledge, was also con-ducted. In addition, a request for references andopinions was made via a private worldwide equinereproduction email network. This research was re-peated in January of 2017 and the results reportedhere. 3. Quantity of Evidence Eleven, 28, and 27 papers were retrieved respec-tively; relevance screening was conducted based onabstracts and extended to entire manuscripts incross referencing. This research identied four pa-pers directly applicable to the question during thelast 30 years. 2,4,8,9Of the four papers there was one randomized controlled trial9and three retro- spective studies.2,4,8In addition, ve information.10-14 124 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MARE Author's Note - this paper is modied from Equine Vet Educ 2016;28(1):58-59. Adapted with permission. NOTES4. Quality of Evidence The study by Hooper and coworkers8looked retro - spectively at 23 cases of bilateral ovariectomy be-tween 1984 and 1990 by client survey. Of the 23cases, 16 were for the purpose of behavior modica-tion and seven were for other reasons not includingovarian pathology. Kamm and Hendrickson 2re- ported the results of a retrospective study of 35 casesbetween 1996 and 2005 by client survey. The re-ported data included both bilateral and unilateralovariectomy with the latter being due to ovarian pathology. Twenty-three mares had bilateral ovari-ectomy for behavioral problems. Roessner and co-workers 4reported results of a retrospective study of 20 cases of bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy for thetreatment of estrus-related or performance prob-lems over an undened period of time. Data wascollected by telephone survey. The objectives of thestudy were to compare the behavioral improvementseen with altrenogest therapy alone to improvementafter bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy and to de-termine whether the behavioral or performance im-provements reported with altrenogest therapy werepredictive of the response to ovariectomy. Theseretrospective observational studies, based on clientrecollection and opinion, represent relatively weakevidence, are inherently biased, and do not addressthe possibility of a human placebo effect. The study by Hedberg and coworkers 9primarily looked at the effect of adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) (tetracosactide) on steroid hormone levels inve intact versus ve ovariectomized mares. Themares acted as their own controls and the study wasconducted in successive years (2003-2004). Of theparameters measured, estrous behavior was as-sessed by daily teasing with a stallion. Teasingbehavior was assessed and scored using a standard-ized protocol. This prospective case-control designhas greater evidentiary value than the retrospectivestudy despite the relatively low numbers. Teasingscores, however, were not subject to statisticalanalysis and remained observational. This paperformed part of a greater work that looked at theadrenal response to ACTH between normal and\"problem\" mares. 1 Additional information was gathered from ve pa- pers describing surgical techniques for ovariectomy.Owner feedback and observations were included;however, characterization of the behavior patternsdemonstrated by the mares prior to ovariectomy waseither absent or incomplete and the owner feedbackwas not claried or quantied. 10-14 5. Clinical Implications Hedberg and coworkers9demonstrated that ovariec - tomy resulted in continued displays of sexual recep-tiveness in all mares with a loss of normal cyclicactivity. Ovariectomized mares showed more daysof behavioral estrus compared with when they wereintact; 44 days of behavioral estrus for all intactmares compared with 152 days for all ovariectomizedmares during the study period of 4 months (June-September). One ovariectomized mare showed 78consecutive days of estrus. This nding is sup- ported by the author's experience and earlier pub-lished observations that ovaries are not essential forestrus behavior in the mare. 15,16 Hooper and coworkers8reported that 35% of mares ovariectomized demonstrated continued es-trus behavior. In 9% of cases this was judged to beobjectionable by the owners. Of 12 performancemares, 10 were judged to be competing at greater-than-preoperative levels. In the report by Kammand Hendrickson, 222% of owners reported that they were either impartial or dissatised; mainly due to afailure of behavioral change following surgery.More generalized behavioral problems were morelikely to be corrected following ovariectomy thanmore specic behavioral issues. Aggressive behav-ior and a generalized disagreeable demeanor weremost commonly corrected (86% 81%, respec-tively), followed by excitability kicking training that re-lated to estrous-like behavior (72%). Problemswith other horses and frequent urination, inter-preted by this author as more likely overt reproduc-tive behaviors, were less likely to be improved aftersurgery (64%). These studies did not address theconcept of ovarian pain as a cause of subtle behav- ioral issues encountered in ridden competitionhorses. The report by Roessner and coworkers 4was inter - esting as it only included mares that had undergonetreatment with altrenogest for a minimum durationof 2 weeks at \"some time\" before surgery. At leastsome reduction in objectionable behaviors had tohave been observed with altrenogest treatment.This was suggested by the authors to support thediagnosis of an estrus-related behavioral problem.Primary estrus-related problems were dened askicking, bucking or rearing (6/20); colic during es-trus or ovulation (4/20); refusal to work during es-trus (3/20); aggressiveness to other horses, people, orboth (3/20); stallion-like painduring estrus (2/20). Some response was seen in allmares with altrenogest and ovariectomy was associ-ated with a signicantly better outcome than that ofaltrenogest therapy. The denition and frequencyof responses were, however, not reported. It is as-sumed that not all responses were positive given therange and the Likert scale used. The responses inrelation to the presenting behavioral problem werenot reported. Six mares (30%) demonstrated estrussigns at least once postovariectomy and in fourmares (20%) mild estrous signs persisted. It is im-portant to note that the dosage of altrenogest re-ported in this study varied from 0.044 to 0.176mg/kg and therefore one cannot rule out a direct\"calming\" effect at a higher (central nervous system[CNS]) level. 17This is supported by the fact that progestogens such as altrenogest are also often ef- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 125THE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MAREfective at curbing unwanted sexual or aggressivebehavior in geldings. 18The report of Roessner and coworkers4included two mares that demonstrated colic as a result of estrus or ovulation. This wasestablished by the fact that this behavior was sup-pressed by treatment with altrenogest. It is theopinion of this author that mares may have palpably\"sensitive\" ovaries which can be related to undesir-able behaviors, however it is important to note thatfollicular development and ovulation; therefore, thepain associated with this is not reliably suppressedby altrenogest at the standard dose. The study re-ported that four mares, with the owner observationof no noticeable improvement while on altrenogest,were excluded from the statistical analysis on thebasis that the behavior was not associated with es-trus or ovarian cyclicity. Further investigation ofthese mares would have been necessary to deter-mine whether ovarian cyclicity and consequentlyovarian sensitivity or pain were present while onaltrenogest therapy. It should be noted that thesemares did respond favorably to ovariectomy. In ad-dition, one mare was reported to demonstrate stal-lion-like behavior and it should be noted that noendocrinological screening nor histopathologicalanalysis of removed ovaries was part of the inclusioncriteria; only ovaries of a palpably normal size,therefore ovarian neoplasia in the mares in thisstudy cannot be ruled out. Review of the ve surgical reports retrieved the following owner observations post bilateral ovariec-tomy: Twenty percent of mares (1/5) demonstratedoccasional manifestation of estrus 10; in 67% (4/6) objectionable behavior was eliminated, and im-provement reported in all mares 11; colic signs asso - ciated with estrus eliminated mare owners satised with the behavioral re-sults in mares with unruly behavior and decreasedathletic performance associated with estrus 13; 75% (3/4) mares with aggressive behavior resolved and25% (1/5) results did not meet their expectations. 14 6. Clinical Message The current data would suggest that if the undesir-able behavior that prompts presentation is normalsexual (estrous) behavior then the likelihood is thatovariectomy will not correct the problem. In fact,ovariectomy may make the situation worse as es-trous behavior may become irregular and/or persis-tent post surgery. It is not clearly understood whyovariectomized mares demonstrate estrogen-drivenreproductive behavior, but it is often assumed to bedue to estrogen of extragonadal origin with the mostlikely source being the adrenal gland. Asa and co-workers 15demonstrated that all of the 10 ovariecto - mized and 10 seasonally anestrus mares in thestudy demonstrated signs of behavioral estrus uponteasing with a stallion. All mares solicited copula-tion from stallions, were sexually attracted to them,and tolerated mounts, intromissions, and ejacula-tions. It was suggested that the luteal ovary playsa controlling role in the inhibition of estrous behav-ior, with progesterone providing the mechanism forperiodic inhibition of sexual behavior during diestrus. It was hypothesized that the adrenal gland was themost likely source of estrogen as in primate spe-cies. 19-22Phytoestrogens of dietary origin were ac - knowledged by Asa and coworkers,15as a potential source of estrogen stimulation. Given that estrusis more vigorous than that observed in ovariecto-mized or anovulatory mares, it was hypothesizedthat additional steroidal stimulation is supplied by theovarian follicles in the days just prior to ovulation.Further evidence of adrenal steroids stimulating sex-ual behavior was provided by a second experiment byAsa and coworkers, 23who demonstrated suppression of behavioral estrus when dexamethasone was suppress the adrenal gland. of androgen to estrogen hasbeen demonstrated to be present in the equine fetaladrenal gland, 25but it is not known whether the same is true for the adult. If the behavior is aggressive in character, then ovariectomy is more likely to be a successful ther-apy but the evidence for this is weak. Morgantiand coworkers 26demonstrated that serum cortisol was signicantly with elevatedtestosterone, suggesting that adrenal cortical ac-tivation in mares may result in increases in bothserum cortisol and testosterone and that stress inmares may be associated with some aspects ofaggressive or stallion-like behavior. It has alsobeen demonstrated that ACTH treatment causes asignicant increase in plasma levels of cortisoland testosterone in both intact 1and ovariecto - study by Dalin and cowork - ers,27it was noted that the most nervous mare in the study showed the highest adrenal testosteronelevels, whereas the calmest mare, the lowest. If ovarian pain, which may in the extreme case cause colic, is considered as a cause of abnormal orundesirable behavior, then ovariectomy may be indi-cated and curative; however, inducing ovarian inactiv-ity via the use of a gonaotropin-releasing hormone(GnRH) vaccine may be a viable option that does notrequire surgery. Mares vaccinated against GnRHcan however also demonstrate estrous behavior afterovarian inactivation. 28,29 Regardless of the reason for performing ovariec- tomy, it would be prudent to warn an owner of thepossibility of intermittent or persistent signs of estrousbehavior post ovariectomy. Future studies with ac-curate denition of the cause and characteristics of thebehavior along with matched controls may enable amore denitive and comprehensive answer to thequestion. 126 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MAREAcknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veter-inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

Hendrickson, DVM, MS, DACVS There are a few commonly used methods for ovariectomy in the mare. Laparoscopic ovariectomy hasbecome one of the most common methods and in many ways is the current standard of care. Most horsesrespond well to ovariectomy for behavioral issues. Author's address: 1678 reasons for performing an equine ovariec-tomy include reducing inappropriate behavior, ovar-ian neoplasia, and the desire to stop the animal frombecoming pregnant. There are at least three re-ports looking at the benet of behavioral changeswith et behavioral change usingventral laparoscopic approach. In a retrospectivestudy on 35 mares by Kamm and Hendrickson 2in 2007, behavioral improvement was seen in 83%(19/23) of mares treated for behavioral-relatedproblems. Aggression problems improved in 86%(12/14) of cases, general in 81% (17/21), and improvedin 75% (12/16) of werepreviously observed. Kicking and biting improvedin 73% (8/11), problems in training improved in 72%(13/18), and frequent urination and problems withother horses improved in 64% (7/11 and 9/14, respec-tively) of cases. Owners with nonovariectomizedmares were also contacted to compare the normalprogression of mare behavior over time to thebehavioral change in ovariectomized mares. Astatistically signicant change in behavior ofovariectomized mares over nonovariectomizedmares was seen in the categories of decreased ag-gression ( P/H11021.01), decreased training problems ( P/H11021 .025), decreased frequency of problem behaviors(P/H11021.001), and improved overall behavior ( P/H11021.01). In cases where medical problems such as granulosacell tumors, ovarian cysts, and cycle-related colic weretreated with ovariectomy, all of the clients were verysatised with the treatment, whereas clients attempt-ing to treat cycle-related laminitis were dissatised. 2 In the third study, the authors found that bilaterallaparoscopic ovariectomy was perceived by owners ortrainers to be at least as effective as altrenogest ad-ministration with respect to diminishing a number ofestrus-related behavioral and performance problems. 3 In an abstract of a recent presentation, clients were94% satised or very satised with the behaviorchanges in their horses after laparoscopic ovariec-tomy. 4In an unpublished study in dude string horses, the satisfaction rate was 100%. We nd thatmore and more clients are opting for ovariectomy, es-pecially with the ability to do it using a laparoscopictechnique, in order to not have to deal with cycle-related behavioral issues. In the long run, it is gen-erally less expensive than hormone administration.However, once the ovaries are removed, the horse can-not be used for reproductive purposes again. 128 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MARE NOTES2. Methods for Equine Ovariectomy (Include Costs,Benets, Complications) There are many methods available for performingequine ovariectomies. These include traditionalapproaches such techniques used, theyare rapidly replaced by minimally invasivetechniques such laterally recumbent ovariectomy. laparoscopic with which re-portedly causes death in 0.12-0.9% of equinepatients. 5,6Laparoscopy requires multiple small incisions, with one to two incisions enlarged onlyenough to remove the ovary, thereby decreasing scarsize and recovery time compared with other flankand ventral approaches. Although there has notyet been a large study looking at the complicationrate of mares after standing laparoscopic ovariec-tomy, it is the author's impression that morbidity isvery rare and that the most common complication issubcutaneous emphysema in the flank region anddrainage and incisional dehiscence of the length-ened incision. The approach described by Dechantet al 7uses three 1-cm incisions on the right, two 1-cm incisions on the left, and one incision on the leftside large enough to remove both ovaries. The sur-gery can be performed in less than 1 hour using alocalized bilateral flank block and an epidural be-tween the rst and second coccygeal vertebra. 7 Intraoperative pain can be decreased using a meso-varian injection of 10 mL of 2% lidocaine prior tooperating upon the ovary. 8The mares mg/kg flunixin meglumine IV immedi-ately postoperatively 1.1mg/kg flunixin meglumine or 2.2 mg/kg phenylbuta-zone q 12 h orally for 4 further days. The mares aregenerally given only a single dose of procaine peni-cillin G IM prior to surgery. Standing-Flank Laparoscopic Ovariectomy9 The horse is held off feed for 12 hours prior to sur-gery. When performing a bilateral ovariectomy,both flanks must be prepared for surgery. Six can-nulas are necessary for this procedure. The mare issedated with detomidine and butorphanol to effect,placed in standing stocks, and a jugular catheter isplaced. To maintain sedation, 20 mg of detomidineis placed i n1Lo fI Vfluids, connected to the jugular catheter, and given to effect. The flanks areclipped, aseptically prepared, and the portal sitesare inltrated with 10 mL of carbocaine each. Theventral two most portal sites in the left flank areconnected with an additional 10 mL of carbocaine.The mesovarium should be inltrated with 10-15mL of local anesthetic prior to amputation. Withnormal-sized ovaries, the ovarian pedicle can be li-gated using ligating loops, ultrasonic devices, vessel-sealing devices, electrosurgery, lasers, staplingdevices, or polyamide tie-raps. When using ligat-ing loops, the mesosalphinx and the proper ligamentof the ovary are sharply dissected to provide asmaller pedicle for ligation. Generally a shorterknot pusher is used in order to have a larger ligatingloop to t over the ovary. After amputation of theovaries, the right ovary is passed under the smallcolon to the left side of the abdomen, and both ova-ries are removed from the enlarged ventral-flankincision. In juvenile mares, it has been reportedthat the ovary can be amputated and dropped withinthe abdomen with no untoward effects. In cases ofgranulosa thecal-cell tumor (GCT) removal, only theflank of the affected ovary needs to be prepared aslong as only one ovary is going to be removed. Itcan be difcult to use ligating loops on an enlargedGCT; consequently, a LigaSure adevice is generally recommended. It is possible to use a ligating loopon an ovary up to 18 cm in diameter, and to removean ovary up to 25 cm in diameter using a LigaSuredevice. If the GCT has large cystic areas on ultra-sound, it is possible to use an injection needle alongwith a suction device to remove cystic fluid, therebyreducing the size of the ovary. There have been anumber of reports on the use of hand-assisted lapa- roscopy for ovariectomy. Although an en larged incision is necessary for this technique, the eventualsize of the incision is not dissimilar to the nalincision for ovarian removal. This is especially truein the case of GCTs, and can be technically easierthan a straight laparoscopic approach. AlthoughGCTs are the most common disease process with enlarged ovaries, teratomas may also be present.Other techniques for removing large GCTs include morcellators and surgical pouches. It is the au-thor's opinion that standing laparoscopic ovariec-tomy is easier to perform than while under generalanesthesia given that the ovary hangs from the dor-sal body wall. The horses are kept in a box stall for2 weeks after surgery and then brought back intowork. The cost for this procedure, including twonights in the hospital, is around $1500.00. We dobetween 20 and 30 standing laparoscopic Laparoscopic Ovariectomy are performed inmares where only one ovary is to be removed. Gen-erally, these mares have large GCTs. The maresare held off feed for between 18 and 24 hours, anes-thetized, and placed in lateral recumbency. Theportals are the same as for the standing flank lapa-roscopy. The ovarian pedicle is best transectedwith a LigaSure device. The incisions are enlargedand the ovary removed from the abdomen. Themares are placed in a box stall after surgery for 2-4weeks depending on the size of the incision and thenare brought back into work. The cost for this pro- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 129THE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MAREcedure is approximately $2000.00. We rarely per-form ovariectomy using this method in our hospital.The advent of the LigaSure device and greater ex-perience in doing laparoscopy allow us to do most ofthese in the standing horse. Dorsally Recumbent Laparoscopic Ovariectomy9 Dorsally recumbent ovariectomy requires general anesthesia and aggressive tipping into Trendelen-berg position. Given that the horse will be tippedhead down, tail up, they need to be held off feed fora longer period of time. Generally 18-24 hours issufcient; however, putting the horse on a pelletedration for 3-5 days may also be benecial. It isrecommended that the table be tipped at least 30\u00b0 inorder to move the abdominal visceral forward andaway from the uterus and ovaries. It is vital to beable to do positive pressure ventilation for thesehorses under anesthesia. The ovaries and ovarianpedicles are not as accessible in a dorsally recum-bent horse as they are in a standing horse. Twoligating loops per ovary, or a LigaSure device can beused to ligate and amputate the ovaries. One ofthe incisions, often the portal at the umbilicus, canbe enlarged to remove the ovaries. The horses areplaced in a stall after surgery for 4 weeks and thenslowly brought back into work. The cost for thisprocedure at our hospital is around $2000.00. Werarely perform dorsally recumbent laparoscopicovariectomy, mostly due to surgeon's preference. 3. Outcomes After Ovariectomy In general, clients and trainers are happy or veryhappy after laparoscopic ovariectomy as long as theprocedure is done for behavioral issues. If thereare medical issues, such as cycle-related laminitis,the satisfaction rate seems to be much lower.

Introduction Our veterinary school reproduction and behaviorgroup regularly evaluates mares presented for be-havior changes attributed to or suspected to berelated to normal ovarian activity or pathology.In addition, our surgery group, when asked toperform ovariectomy for behavior or performanceproblems, routinely recommends evaluation byour reproduction and behavior team in advance ofsurgery. In the majority of such cases, results ofsystematic evaluation suggests that the root causeof the behavior or performance problem is discom-fort unrelated to ovarian activity or pathology.In a subset of these, the severity of the problembehavior resulting from the root cause of physicaldiscomfort is found to vary with normal ovarianfunction, such that the behavior problem is under-standably misattributed to the ovaries. Usingcase examples, this presentation will describe ourevaluation process and example diagnoses andresolution. The following comments and tablessummarize what we feel are key aspects to sys-tematic evaluation of such cases.2. Obtaining a Detailed Behavior History Summary terms often used to describe these clusters of behaviorto different people. The most informative behaviorhistory includes detailed description of the specicelements of the problem behavior and how the be-havior varies over time and in various situations.This is most efciently obtained directly from peopleworking with the animal. Questions such as \"Whatexactly does she do? What all is involved, her body,ears, tail, limbs, mouth? Can you predict when sheis going to do it? Can you provoke the behavior?Can you interrupt the behavior? How is she withother mares, with geldings, or when exposed to astallion? Is there any time she doesn't exhibit thebehavior?\" These are often helpful toward honingin on an unambiguous understanding of the problembehavior. In addition, questions concerning themare's behavior in each season, particularly duringwinter when the ovaries are likely to be inactive,along with any available examination results onovarian status and/or endocrine all are help- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 131THE HEAT IS OFF - REPRODUCTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE MARE NOTESTable 1.

For example, if the problem behavior truly isbehavior resulting from estrus, and it has continuedduring winter anestrus, then ovariectomy is notlikely to improve the behavior, and may actuallymake matters worse. When taking the history, observing examples of the problem behavior can be informative. Clientsoften can provide video-recorded examples of theproblem behavior, and in some cases can reliablypredict or provoke the problem behavior for directobservation. Table 1 summarizes specic behavioral elements of estrus and diestrus compared with behaviors of-ten misattributed to ovarian function or dysfunc-tion. This rubric can be quite helpful forstructuring discussion of the problem behavior his-tory with clients and caretakers. In many in-stances, there is considerable misunderstanding ofthe specic elements of normal estrus, diestrus, andstallion-like behavior. Fig. 1, depicting the keypostural elements of estrus, along with similar linedrawings and photographs illustrating specicstallion-typical postures and behaviors as well asspecic elements of stallion-mare interactive se-quences can also be useful in this regard. 1 3. Making a Diagnostic Plan In most of the cases we evaluate, the history sug-gests that physical discomfort may be either the rootcause or a principal factor contributing to the prob-lem behavior that should be ruled out before recom-mending interventions aimed at the ovaries. Table2 summarizes the evaluations we consider. Wend it most time- and cost effective to begin witha reproductive tract exam so that we know ovarianstatus at the time and can rule out anyabnormalities or potential sources of urogenital dis-comfort. This is coordinated with a 24-hour video- taped sample of the mare for evaluation of behavioralsigns of discomfort. 2,3For mares alone in a stall, animated bucking, kicking out, kicking walls, slap-ping the abdomen against walls or backing into orrubbing the hindquarters into walls or objects, selfbiting, pawing (other than in anticipation of feed-ing), and frequent frustration head shaking all arecommonly misinterpreted as especially demonstra-tive estrus or diestrus, but more often are indica-tions of physical discomfort. Squeal or gruntvocalizations, frequent urination or defecation, al-though normal responses to social provocation dur-ing various stages of estrus or diestrus, in theabsence of social stimulation or pressure, also moreoften are the result of physical discomfort. In pain-ful mares, these behaviors can also occur in responseto any handling or social pressure, which can under-standably complicate interpretation. Depending on the nding of video behavior eval- uation, various challenges can be arranged to con-rm suspected conditions. For example, should themare's behavior in her stall suggest male-type be-havior, the mare's behavior in response to exposureto excrement of stallions or exposure to mares inestrus and diestrus or their excrement can be usefulin conrming male-type behavior. Exposure toother mares or to stallions while observing the be-havioral response of both the subject mare and thestimulus animal can also provide insight. 4.

In some cases, two or more sources of discom- fort were identied. For example, it is not uncommonfor horses with musculoskeletal or caudal abdominalvisceral discomfort to also have gastric ulcers, eitheras an independent condition or understandably sec-ondary to the stress of the other discomfort.

If intervention is sought early in theprocess, there are many treatment options avail-able, with the best option being highly dependent onthe structures involved, and extent of the involve-ment.

There are many adjunctive treat-ment options to combine with debulking of thetumor. chemotherapy, top-ical chemotherapy, and hyperthermia been re-ported with variable success rates. H-plasty can besuccessful in some instances to achieve clean mar-gins of a lid tumor, but can have limitations if thetumor involves more than one third the length of thelid margin. The use of photodynamic dye therapy (PDT) for squamous-cell carcinoma has been well describedin humans and small animals. 1For these spe- cies, the dye (verteporn) is injected systemically,and the tumor is then exposed to the appropriatelight wavelength percutaneously for a deep tumor,or directly for a surface tumor. After injection,the dye is rapidly taken up by the remaining tu-mor cells. Light activation of the dye causes arelease of free-oxygen radicals which results incellular necrosis. For the horse, however, the dose isinjected directly into the tumor bed after the majorityof the tumor is debulked. 2,3The injected tumor bed is then locally exposed to the 690-nm light to activate thedye. 2. Materials and Methods For PDT in horses, the patient is sedated with deto-midine hydrochloride at a dosage of 0.02-0.04 mg/kgintravenously (Fig. 1). The base of the tumor islocally blocked with mepivicaine in sufcient volumeto allow for debulking of the tumor down to surfacelevel. A clean margin is not usually attainable.The goal is to reduce the tumor while creating a flattumor bed for injection of the dye. The dye is thenreconstituted and injected into the tumor bed. Mostlesions are treated with 3.5 mg of verteporn arecon- stituted with sterile water for injection to a volume that will allow all the dye to be injected into thetumor base. Care should be taken to avoid overdiluting the dye such that there is too much volumethat cannot be accommodated by the tumor base.

Multiple activation sites will be usedbased on size of the lesion. Note: The dye willcontinue to be activated by sunlight. Care shouldbe taken to avoid extended light exposure. A flymask with ultraviolet radiation (UV) protection anddaytime stall rest is recommended for 7-10 days.Immediately post procedure, flunixin meglumine ata dosage of 1.1 mg/kg is administered intravenouslyand triple antibiotic ophthalmic ointment is placedin the eye. The treated area will swell signicantlyand will have a thick ocular drainage for 5-7 days.Patients can be given flunixin meglumine orally asneeded to control pain and swelling. Most patientsdo not require more than 2-3 days of NSAIDS.The discharge will resolve and owners can clean thearea around the eye with warm wet cloths to removethe drainage. 3. Results Remodeling of the tumor bed can take up to 4months, and requires periodic rechecks and possibleadjunctive therapy for complete resolution (Figs.2-6). Fig. 1.

Discussion PDT is an emerging option for invasive periocularSCC. 5Costs are variable depending on size and nature of the tumor. The major advantage to usingPDT is the reduced recurrence rate when compared withconventional adjunctive treatments, such as debulking,cryotherapy, and chemotherapy. Although the dye canbe repeated multiple times for residual tumor, once isgenerally all that is necessary. If small amounts of tu-mor remain, those areas can generally be cleaned upwith conventional adjunctive therapies.

Nonethe-less, standing surgery is often elected for equinepatients in the eld due to risk of placing a horseunder general anesthesia in the eld and nancialconsiderations. Achieving a successful outcomewhen performing surgery in the ocular region isdependent on careful restraint of the patient thatassures a steady head position, good analgesiathat assures patient cooperation, and the appli-cation of best practice surgical principles whenhandling delicate periocular tissues. Appropriate choices for instrumentation, suture sizes, needles,and post-operative care are also very important.Handling periocular tissue incorrectly can lead todevastating complications to the eye, includingkeratitis, corneal ulceration, trichiasis, and couldend with an enucleation (Fig. 1). The purpose of this paper is to explain how to prepare for standing surgery in equine ophthal-mology patients. The proceedings will also coverthe most common periocular surgeries that aredone on the standing horse in the eld. Withstudy and practice, equine practitioners canachieve excellent results when performing thesesimple standing periocular procedures. How-ever, referral of ophthalmic patients to a veteri-nary ophthalmologist with equine experience isrecommended if the presenting ophthalmic dis-ease extends beyond clinician expertise and/orcomfort level and the owner is willing to refer. 2. Sedation, Restraint, and Preparation of the Patient Adequate sedation of the patient is important.Depending on the surgical procedure, the horse will AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 139HOW TO SESSION: OPHTHALMOLOGY NOTESneed be for 1 to 2 hours, including prep-aration time, clipping, and cleaning. Detomidinehydrochloride aat a dose of 0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg (10 mg/mL IV solution) is the best intravenous sedativefor equine periocular surgeries. intravenous detomidine doses of 0.005 to 0.01mg/kg are usually effective to supplement the initialdose. In surgeries where a need for prolonged an-esthesia is expected, acepromazine maleate bat a dose of 0.02 to 0.05mg/kg (10 mg/mL IV solution) canbe administered intravenously in addition to deto-midine. Acepromazine should be given 15 to 30min before surgery due to slow onset of action andshould be used with caution, especially in stallionsand geldings due to risk of penis protrusion andentrapment (Table 1). 1,2Intravenous butorphanol tartratecat a dose of 0.01 mg/kg (10 mg/mL IVsolution) can be used in addition to detomidine forpain control and longer-lasting sedation but thisdrug can cause uncontrolled head movements and isnot often used for standing periocular surgeries. 1,2 It is important to have one or two assistants while doing the surgery. One assistant will be standingon the opposite side of the horse steadying the head.The horse's mandible will need to rest on a tablemade of hay or shavings bales or another solid sup-port such as a rolling bin or equine dental headstand(Fig. 2). The head should be placed so that thesurgery site is at the correct height for the clinicianto perform the surgery without standing in an ab-normal position. A second table with a sterile sur-face should be nearby. Surgical instruments arelaid out on this table to make them easily accessibleand keep them as sterile as possible. An assistantcan open sterile instruments and suture material Fig. 1. Complications of eyelid lacerations in horses. A, An eyelid laceration of the lower eyelid was not correctly apposed in thishorse. As a result, a divot of the lower eyelid caused the horse to have ectropion with high risk of corneal ulceration and conjunctivitis(red arrow). B, Another horse where an upper eyelid laceration (red arrow) was not correctly apposed, leaving the horse with a largedivot in the eyelid which exposes the cornea, causing keratitis and risk of corneal ulceration.

Good illumination is very im-portant when handling the periocular tissue andplacing small sutures. A surgical lamp, an ofcetable lamp, or a headlamp can be used for properlighting (Fig. 3). 3 No horse will cooperate for surgery of the perioc- ular and ocular region without adequate pain con-trol. is delivered using injectablelidocaine solution) and/or bupi - vacained(0.25% injectable solution) in the area of the surgical site. Lidocaine will give a fast onset ofaction and last for about 1 hour, whereas bupiva- caine will have a slower onset of action but last for 3to 10 hours. 4,5An auriculopalpebral nerve block should be used in all periocular surgeries and pro-cedures (Fig. 4). Depending on the surgery or pro-cedure, other ophthalmic nerve blocks (e.g.,supraorbital nerve block [Fig. 5]) and local ringand/or line blocks can be used. Auriculopalpebral Nerve Block Strong eyelid muscles make horses good at closingtheir eyes, which complicates standing periocularsurgery. It is necessary to block the orbicularisoculi muscle that is responsible for part of the eyelidclosure to prevent or decrease blinking. An auricu-lopalpebral nerve block causes temporary loss of Fig. 2. The position of the head is very important when perform-ing standing ophthalmic surgery on the periocular region.

The block is performed with 1-2mL of local anesthetic using a 25-gauge 5/8 in. needle. Theyellow line shows the path of the facial nerve and three differentsites where the auriculopalpebral nerve block can be per-formed: 1) Where the facial nerve runs over the zygomatic archcaudal to the bony process of the frontal bone. It is easy topalpate the nerve here and this site is commonly used for injec-tion. 2) Dorsal to the highest point of the zygomatic arch. Thenerve is more difcult to palpate but this site accesses morebranches of the nerve and may be more effective than the rstsite. 3) Caudal to the posterior ramus of the mandible at adepression at the most ventral aspect of the ear where the caudalborder of the coronoid process of the mandible meets the zygo-matic process of the temporal bone. This injection site is usefulwhen the horse has a skull fracture or other abnormality that willnot allow palpation of the nerve.

The block is per-formed using a 25-gauge 5/8-in. needle to inject localanesthetic into the subcutaneous tissue above thenerve. Three different areas can be used for theinjection site (Fig. 4). 5,6 Supraorbital Nerve Block The supraorbital nerve block abolishes sensation tothe upper eyelid by blocking the frontal (supraor-bital) nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminalnerve (CN V). This block is useful for upper eyelidsurgeries and procedures involving the cornea ornictitans. It is most commonly performed with a25-gauge 5/8-in. needle and 1-2 mL of local anes-thetic that is injected into the subcutaneous tissueabove the supraorbital foramen (Fig. 5). Cliniciansshould avoid inserting the needle into the foramenas this can damage the blood vessels or nerves exit-ing the foramen. 5,6 Line Blocks for Periocular Surgeries The supraorbital nerve block will only block thesensation of the upper eyelid. Line blocks for othersensory nerve branches of the trigeminal nerve areuseful, especially when surgery to the lower eyelid isneeded. The zygomatic nerve, which is a branch ofthe trigeminal nerve that innervates most of thetemporal aspect of the lower eyelid, can be blockedwith a line block along the ventrolateral orbital rim. 6 Preparation for surgery begins with preparing the tissues involved. Unless the horse has a long win-ter coat, clipping the surgery site is not usuallynecessary. If clipping is required it should be donewith caution as some horses respond poorly to theclipper noise while under standing sedation. Inser-tion of cotton balls in the ears can be a useful aid aslong as they are removed after surgery. Trimmingthe eyelashes for repair of eyelid lacerations is rec-ommended given that the eyelashes can be difcultto differentiate from a black Nylon 4-0 suture.Alcohol and chlorhexidine should never be used toclean the surgical site as these liquids are irritatingto the cornea. Betadine scrub preparations alsocontain alcohol and should not be used for cleaningof the periocular or ocular tissue. It is recommendedto 2% to 5% solution of dilute betadine solutionthat is the color of strong tea to clean the surgicalsite, then rinse the tissue with sterile saline (Fig.6). 5,7This concentration of betadine solution is safe to use on the ocular surface and conjunctiva aswell as the skin. Surgical drapes are not necessaryfor standing periocular surgeries as they will scarethe horse more than they help with sterility, andtowel clamps cannot be used to x drapes to the skinin the awake horse. The equine halter can be cov-ered with sterile towels to collect hemorrhage andprovide a sterile surface below and/or around thesurgery site. Fig. 5. The supraorbital nerve block will cause analgesia of the frontal nerve, which provides sensation to the upper eyelid. A, Thefrontal nerve (trigeminal nerve\u2014sensory) exits the skull at the supraorbital foramen located above the orbital rim in the frontal bone(yellow arrow). B, The supraorbital foramen is palpated and a 25-gauge 5/8 in. needle is placed in the subcutaneous tissue above theforamen to inject 1-2 mL of local anesthetic into the tissue.

Ac-cording to the AAEP's Core Vaccination Guidelines,a tetanus toxoid booster should be administered be-fore surgery if status of vaccination is not current oris unknown. 8 3. Periocular Surgery Pack Instruments Having the correct instruments is another impor-tant aspect of preparation for surgery of the perioc-ular tissue. The large needle drivers and tissueforceps with large-sized teeth used for many otherequine surgical procedures are not recommended asthey can damage tissue and bend delicate smallneedles, predisposing to complications. 9,10A surgi - cal pack surgeries should include thefollowing instruments (Fig. 7): 1.Small needle holder (e.g., Derf needle holder): The importance of a correct-size needle holder cannot be overemphasized. Thelarge needle holders used in equine practicewill bend the small needles used in periocu-lar surgery, making it impossible to place theneedle in the correct position and causingexcess tissue trauma.

Headlamps used for dental work mayalso be suitable for periocular surgery. 4. Suture Choice Selection of the correct-size suture and needle pointis important for periocular surgery. Corneal ulcer-ations can result if suture diameter is too large.Suture rupture and wound dehiscence can result ifthe suture is too thin. Fine gauge 4-0 Nylon su- ture with a P3 reverse cutting needle fis recom - mended for suturing skin. The P3 needle is apremium reverse cutting needle that is often usedfor plastic or cosmetic surgery. It has a 3/8 circlediameter and the micropoint tip has a triangularshape geometry that is nicely sized for placing agure-eight suture in the eyelid margin. The after 30 days. gauge 2-0 suture with a straight cutting needlefis rec - ommended for securing the tabs that accompanyplacement of subpalpebral lavage (SPL) system. 5. Tissue Handling Periocular tissue is delicate and must be handledwith care. The importance of having the correct-size instruments for periocular surgery cannot beoveremphasized as applying too much pressure tothe tissue with a forceps with large teeth will causetissue necrosis and poor healing. A Bishop Har-mon forceps with 0.5- or 0.8-mm teeth is an appro-priate instrument for handling equine perioculartissue as the forceps teeth are small enough to min-imize pressure necrosis on eyelid tissue (0.8 mm)and conjunctiva (0.5 mm), but large enough to lift upany tissue that should be investigated. SmallerBishop Harmon forceps with 0.3- or 0.12-mm teethare too small for many of the periocular surgicalprocedures performed in a standing horse. Many equine periocular surgeries require manip- ulation of the third be challenginggiven that globe retraction causes unpredictablethird eyelid movement, and much of the nictitans isseated deep in the nasal canthus. If a Bishop Har-mon forceps that has 0.8-mm teeth is used to evertthe nictitans, tissue damage can occur during re-traction. An Adson tissue 1 /H110032 teeth forceps is useful for examination of the posterior surface of thethird eyelid, and an Allis tissue forceps can be usedfor manipulation of the nictitans during third eyelidremoval surgery. When working on skin near the eyelid margin, it is important to avoid gripping the periocular skintissue given that this can cause necrosis of skinmargins and poor healing. It is safer to grasp thepalpebral conjunctiva when a section of skin must bemoved given that this tissue is resilient due to anabundant blood supply. 6. Common Ophthlamic Surgeries/ProceduresPerformed on Standing HorsesRemoval of Small Eyelid carci-nomas (SCCs), sarcoids, or conjunctival masses (e.g.,melanoma) can be removed a standing sedatedhorse with either a triangular wedge-shaped resec-tion or \"house-shaped\" resection (Fig. 9). As a gen-eral rule of thumb, only eyelid masses smaller thanone third of the eyelid margin diameter can be re-moved with these two procedures. If more tissue/eyelid margin should be removed, the horse willrequire general anesthesia for blepharoplasty. 12 Blepharoplastic surgeries are complex proceduresthat should be performed by a board certied veter-inary ophthalmologist or veterinary surgeon. Fig. 8. Magnier loupes are recommended when performingsurgery on small eyelid masses or placing small sutures. Theloupes can also be used when collecting cytology samples ( Pho- tograph courtesy of Dr. Christie Wards, of 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO be for sur- gery as described under \"restraint and preparationof the patient\" and an auriculopalpebral nerve block,a supraorbital nerve block, and a ring or line blockshould be used for local analgesia. Direct inltra-tion of the mass with anesthetic should be avoidedgiven that this will distort tissue architecture, inter-fere with histopathological interpretation, and pos-sibly cause spreading of tumor cells. 13 Surgery Description 1. Removal of a small eyelid mass is performed by gripping tissue right next to the mass with a BishopHarmon forceps using the left hand (if the surgeon isright handed) and removing the mass with Stevenstenotomy scissors using the right hand (Fig. 9). 2. The tissue is removed using either a wedge or a \"house-shaped\" pattern as illustrated in Fig. 9.The wedge resection is a simple V-shaped patternthat is full thickness. The mass is removed in onepiece with an adequate margin of normal tissueattached (Fig. 9A). The \"house\" resection pattern isalso full thickness. It involves making two perpen-dicular incisions from the eyelid margin on each sideof the mass, then connecting the two perpendicularcuts with a small V-shaped wedge incision (Fig. 9B).The house resection is the preferred pattern for re-moval of eyelid masses in horses as it avoids removalof excessive normal eyelid tissue. 12 3. An impression smear can be collected for cytology analysis to obtain preliminary information regardingtumor type and possible malignancy. Smear analy- sis of eyelid masses must be followed with histopa-thology to obtain an exact diagnosis and determinewhether the excised tissue margins are free of pa-thology. The eyelid mass is placed in a containerwith a 10:1 ratio of formalin fluid to tissue mass forsubsequent submission to a reference laboratory. 4. The surgical incision should be sutured in two layers. The subcutaneous layer is closed with oneor more sutures of 3-0 to 4-0 Vicryl in a horizontalmattress pattern, and the tarsal margin is closedwith a single 4-0 nylon suture with a P3 reversecutting needle suture that is placed in a gure-eightpattern (Fig. 10). The palpebral surface of the lidconjunctiva should not be penetrated, given that thesuture material could abrade the cornea and causeulceration. The number mattress suture(s) re-quired to appose the subcutaneous tissue dependson the size of the tissue removed, but mattress su-tures should not be placed too close to the eyelidmargin given that this will complicate placement ofthe nal gure-eight suture that brings the eyelidmargin into exact apposition. The suture is a very important suture for periocular surgeries given that it will result is illus - trated in Fig. 10, and the legend describes thesequential steps to insert the suture and close theeyelid gure-eight suture tags away from the ocular surface. 5. The skin incision is closed in a simple inter- rupted pattern, using 4-0 Nylon suture with a P3needle. The long gure-eight suture ends are tucked under the knots of the simple interruptedskin sutures to direct the tags away from the eyelid margin and ensure that these suture ends DONOT touch the cornea and cause corneal ulcer-ations (Fig. 10F). Postoperative treatment: The horse should be treated with systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-tory drugs (NSAIDS) for 3 to 7 days (e.g., flunixinmeglumine 1.1 mg/kg q 12 h PO). Concurrenttreatment with a topical triple antibiotic ophthalmic ointment gapplied three times a day to the eye and along the incision site until suture removal 10 to 14 days aftersurgery. Depending on aseptic conditions during thesurgery, an trimethoprim sulfame - thoxazole [TMS] 25 mg/kg q 12 h PO) may be prescribedfor 5 to 7 days. A hard-cup hood can be used to protectthe surgery site given that any rubbing of the area can Fig. 9. Two different surgical approaches for removing a small eyelid mass. A, A full-thickness wedge resection is performed byusing Stevens tenotomy scissors to cut a triangular wedge (black stippled lines) out of the eyelid. B, A full-thickness \"house-resection\"(four-sided resection) is performed by using Stevens tenotomy scissors to cut four sides out of the eyelid (black stippled lines). Botheyelid wounds are closed as described in the text with one or more simple interrupted subcutaneous mattress suture(s), and agure-eight suture at the eyelid margin followed by simple interrupted sutures in the skin (see Fig. 10; the two surgical approaches in A and B are shown on a cadaver pig eye. ) rupture and incision breakdown. Suturesshould be removed 10 to 14 days after surgery. Repair of Eyelid Lacerations Eyelid lacerations are a common trauma in equinepractice. Repair of eyelid lacerations can be per-formed with the surgical techniques described forexcision of an eyelid mass, but removal of eyelidtissue should be kept to a minimum. Surgical prep-aration and instillation of local nerve blocks areperformed using the techniques described for eyelidmasses. When the area is ready for surgery, thetorn margins should be \"freshened up\" by prudentremoval of message\" for eyelid laceration sur-gery is DO NOT remove any healthy skin or eyelidtissue! It is critical for the surgeon to preserve anintact and functional eyelid as otherwise the corneawill become desiccated severe ulceration and corneal perforation can 1). 15 blade or Stevens tenotomy scis sors is used to debride the lacerated eyelid skinmargins sparingly to eliminate potentially necrotictissue and cause the lacerated margins to bleed.Apposing two skin surfaces that have a healthyblood supply sets the stage for rapid wound healingand good cosmesis. Suturing eyelid lacerationsshould always be attempted no matter how severethe extent of the laceration because even compro-mised necrotic tissue can revitalize after surgery.When signicant eyelid tissue is missing, blepharo-plasty surgery by a skilled board certied veterinaryophthalmologist or veterinary surgeon using gen-eral anesthesia is recommended. Surgery description: When the margins of the torn eyelid tissue have been \"freshened up\" the eye-lid laceration will be sutured back together as de-scribed for excision of an eyelid mass. A smallnumber of horizontal mattress sutures using 3-0 to4-0 Vicryl should be placed in the subcutaneoustissue the lacerated tissue. A gure-eight suture with 4-0 nylon with a P3 reverse cut-ting needle is placed in the eyelid margin to achievea perfect union of the tarsal margin (Fig. 10). Sim-ple interrupted sutures using 4-0 Nylon on a P3needle are used to appose the skin. If the lacera-tion is multiplanar, the repair proceeds along thevarious interrupted tissue planes to recreate theconformation of the original eyelid (Fig. 11). Postoperative treatment: Postoperative treat- ment is the same as described for removal of small eyelid masses but oral antibiotic (e.g., TMS) therapyfor 5 to 7 days is necessary in addition to a topicalantibiotic gand systemic NSAID (e.g., flunixin me - glumine) therapy given that most eyelid lacerationsare caused by trauma and are at high risk for infec-tion. If an infection is already present at the site, Fig. 10. The gure-eight suture. A, The gure-eight is used to appose in eyelid mass resection surgeries or in eyelidlacerations. This photo shows a wedge-shaped defect in the eyelid margin prior to closure. B, The rst closure step involvespenetration of the skin 3-4 mm away from the eyelid margin (1) with the suture exiting the adjacent subcutaneous tissue of the woundmargin (2). The suture is then crossed over the incision to enter the subcutaneous tissue on the opposite side (3) and exit out at theeyelid margin. Great care is taken to assure that the needle exits along the plane of the Meibomian glands (4). C, The suture willthen be crossed over the surgery incision again to enter the eyelid margin on the other side next to the Meibomian glands, (5) and exitthe subcutaneous tissue a few millimeters away from the eyelid margin (6). D, The surgery incision is then crossed again. Thesuture enters the subcutaneous tissue, (7) and exits the skin at the same distance from the eyelid margin as the initial suture onthe opposite side of the surgery incision (8). E, The tags of the gure-eight suture are tied together with a surgeon's knot, leaving thesuture ends long. F, The skin incision is closed with simple interrupted sutures. The two tags of the gure-eight suture knot aretucked under the knots of the skin sutures to direct the tags away from the corneal surface. ( The gure-eight surgery in Fig. 10 is being shown on a cadaver pig eye.) 146 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO SESSION: OPHTHALMOLOGYconsider collecting a sample for culture and sensi-tivity testing prior to preparation of the surgicaleld. Tacking Sutures for Entropion Due to prematurity, dehydration, or sepsis, somefoals are born with entropion of the lower eyelid, ormay acquire the condition in the rst few days oflife. This type of entropion will resolve with time,hydration, and medical therapy and thus should notbe treated with a permanent entropion surgery,given that removal of eyelid skin tissue would overcorrect the lid defect and cause an ectropion. In-stead, entropion in neonates should be treated withtemporary tacking sutures placed in the affectedeyelid to assure that the haired skin on the invertedlid does not cause secondary damage to the corneawith subsequent ulceration. 12,14Tacking sutures can also be used in horses that present with \"spasticentropion\" from ocular pain secondary to cornealulcers or an acute flare-up of equine recurrent uve-itis. These horses benet from temporary tackingsutures that prevent the hair of the inverted eyelidfrom abrading the cornea. Surgery description: The horse should be well sedated. Foals may be placed in lateral recum-bency to allow rm restraint of the head and safeaccess to the affected eyelid. If the foal has bilat-eral entropion it can be flipped over when the rsteyelid is nished to permit suture placement in thefellow eye. If the foal is in lateral recumbency forthe repair, the \"down eye\" should be protected withophthalmic lubrication i, and by resting the head on a towel or blanket to avoid iatrogenic damage fromstall bedding. The surgery site should be cleanedas explained under \"Restraint and preparation ofthe patient.\" A local line block should be used inthe eyelid area where the sutures are going to beplaced. The author uses 4-0 Nylon suture with aP3 needle and places a number of vertical mattresssutures as described in Fig. 12. The \"take-homemessage\" for this procedure is that it is better toovercorrect the entropion slightly given that thetacking suture will loosen up with time and briefexposure of the conjunctiva is acceptable. Postoperative treatment: A hard-cup hood can be placed to avoid rubbing of the eye and disruptionof the tacking sutures. The eye should be moni-tored 2 to 3 times a day to make sure that no com-plications are developing. Topical triple antibiotic g (three times a day for 2 to 3 weeks) can be used onthe sutures, but is not necessary if the foal/horseresists treatment. Removal of the Third Eyelid Removal of the third eyelid is another surgery thatcan be performed on a standing sedated horse.This procedure is most often performed to remove atumor (e.g., SCC) but is occasionally indicated afternictitans trauma. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dryeye) is known to develop in small animals when thethird eyelid is removed but this has not been re-ported to occur in horses, so it is fairly safe to removethe third eyelid without serious side effects. 15 Surgery description: Restraint for third eyelid removal will require head support and heavy seda-tion. The procedure is best performed in stocks,although it can be done in a stall doorway or aisle.The surgery site should be cleaned as explained forthe other procedures. An auriculopalpebral and asupraorbital block should be instilled. Local blocksin and around the nictitans are very important andshould be placed in the area of the third eyelidbase\u2014through the skin surface as well as into theconjunctiva in the deep aspect of the medial can-thus. The conjunctiva of the nictitans base andsurface should be inltrated with 1 to 2 mL of localanesthetic that is injected through a 25-gauge nee-dle attached to a tuberculin syringe. The surface ofthe cornea and the inner and outer aspects of the Fig. 11. Eyelid lacerations in horses should always be repaired and the torn eyelid margins are never cut off.

( Photographs courtesy of Dr. Ann Dwyer, Genesee Valley Equine Rochester, topical anesthetic (propara-caine 0.5% ophthalmic solution j). The surgery site should be cleaned as described for the other proce-dures using dilute 2% to 5% betadine solution that isflushed onto the nictitans and corneal surface.It is also recommended to spray a few drops of top-ical phenylephrine 10% ophthalmic solution onto thesurface of the nictitans to cause vasoconstriction anddecrease bleeding. When the surgery site has been cleaned and is ready for surgery the following steps are taken toexcise the nictitans: 1. An Allis tissue forceps or a small towel clamp is placed in the third eyelid margin and the third eye-lid is retracted from the medial canthus (Fig. 13). 2. A curved hemostat is placed at the base of the third eyelid well below the T-shaped cartilage thatoccupies the center of the third eyelid. The hemo-stat is held in place for 60 seconds to decrease bleed-ing. The hemostat is then removed and a curvedMetzenbaum scissors are used to excise the nicti-tans base along the line where the hemostat con-stricted the vasculature. The hemostat is placedagain on the next portion of the third eyelid base andheld there for another 60 seconds, and the scissorsare used to separate the next piece of third eyelidbase from the palpebral conjunctiva. The process isrepeated to complete the excision of the deepestportion of the nictitans base. The curved hemostatis then applied to the superior margin of the nicti-tans adjacent to the bulbar conjunctiva and similarhemostasis is applied to the upper margin of thestructure, followed by sequential separation of theoccluded tissue with curved Metzenbaum scissorsuntil the third eyelid is removed in a single piece(Fig. 14). 3. The third eyelid should be submitted for histo- pathology if there is concern for neoplasia. 4. It is important to palpate the base of the third eyelid after the procedure to ensure that the T-shaped cartilage of the third eyelid has been re-moved completely, given that leftover cartilage cancause friction on the cornea, discomfort, and cornealulceration (Fig. 15). 5. The conjunctiva and subcutaneous tissue in the deep aspect of the ventral-medial canthus fornix canbe cryoablated in case of potential neoplasia. 12,14 It is important to protect the cornea from the cryo-ablation to prevent corneal ulceration. 14,15This can be done by covering the portion of the corneaadjacent to the cryoablation site with a piece ofStyrofoam cut out of a disposable coffee cup. Cryo-ablation can be performed with either a cryo-probeor liquid nitrogen in a spray bottle k.12The liquid nitrogen spray bottle will produce a noise that isirritating to the horse, so placing cotton balls in theears and heavy sedation is advised for this proce-dure. Two-freeze-thaw cycles of 25 seconds per cy-cle at /H1100280\u00b0C are recommended for each focus of cryoablation. Fig. 12. A goat kid with entropion. A, The kid had developed a corneal ulceration with corneal edema and granulation tissue (yel-low arrow) due to lower eyelid entropion (white arrow). B, Tackingsutures were placed as follows: 1 and 2) A suture bite that is 5-8mm long is placed with the needle going through the skin andsubcutaneous tissue (not full thickness) 2-4 mm from the eyelidmargin (yellow double arrow). 3 and 4) The next suture bite of theinitial vertical mattress suture is placed rostral to the rst one (reddouble arrow), incorporating a similar amount of skin and subcuta-neous tissue. The distance between the two vertical suture bites isdependent on the severity of the entropion. C, The tags to the twovertical suture bites are tied together with a surgeon's knot (whitearrow). When the suture is tied the eyelid tissue that has beenpierced by the suture bites should assume a wrinkled contour thatresults in eversion of the inverted tarsal margin (yellow ar-row). The number of tacking sutures depends of how much of theeyelid has rolled into the cul-de-sac (severity of entropion). In mostcases, three to four tacking the same as for removal of small eyelid masses: 5 to 7days of topical broad-spectrum ophthalmic antibi-otic application to the tear lm three timesa day gand systemic NSAID administration one to two times per day for 3 to 7 days (e.g., flunixinmeglumine). It is recommended that all horsesthat have undergone nictitans excision also shouldbe treated with an oral antibiotic for 5 to 7 days (e.g.,TMS), especially if the third eyelid is being removeddue to trauma. Collection of samples for culture/sensitivity from the surgery site is recommended ifthere are concerns about a pre-existing infection.Complications: One potential complication of third eyelid removal in horses is retrobulbar fatprolapse where adipose tissue residing deep in theorbit protrudes into the nasal canthal region afterthis area has been disturbed surgically. This com-plication can often be prevented if a continuous lineof 6-0 Vicryl suture is placed in the after the nictitans is ex-cised. 14It difcult, however, to place this contin - uous suture in a standing sedated horse. If theowner desires a surgical approach that minimizesthis risk, nictitans removal should be performed bya veterinary ophthalmologist under general anes-thesia. The risk of corneal ulceration is theoreti-cally higher in horses that have undergone nictitansremoval because the third eyelid is not present to Fig. 13. An Allis tissue forceps (A) or a small towel clamp (B) is placed in the third eyelid margin and the third eyelid is retractedfrom the medial canthus (Photographs courtesy of Dr. Ann Dwyer, Genesee Valley Equine Clinic, Rochester, NY. ) Fig. 14. A curved hemostat is placed at the base of the thirdeyelid (under the third eyelid cartilage) to decrease bleeding,after which the hemostat is removed and curved Metzenbaumscissors are used to separate the nictitans from the parent con-junctiva until the third eyelid can be excised in one piece ( Photo- graph courtesy of Dr. Fausto Bellezzo, University of Minnesota. ) Fig. 15.

Placement of a SPL System Horses frequently suffer painful corneal ulcers.Some corneal ulcers become infected or undergo se-vere collagenolysis. These cases require intensetherapy that can involve topical ophthalmic medica-tion administered 6 to 24 times a day with up to fourto six different eye medications delivered at 5-minute treatment intervals. Such treatment mustbe administered through a SPL system. Placing aSPL system is an important skill for equine practi-tioners that treat ophthalmic diseases in their prac-tices. A SPL system makes frequent treatmentmuch easier for horse owners and will ensure goodcompliance for both high-and low-frequency treat-ment schedules. SPL systems come kits 36- and 60-in. lengths l; the 60-in. SPL system is advised given that this length of tubingaccommodates large horses and can be cut shorterfor smaller horses and foals. The author recommends that horses that are treated with SPLs not have access to a pasture andpreferably remain in a stall. Barn temperaturescan fall well below 32\u00b0F in the winter in far-northernlocations, permitting the liquid contents of the SPLline to freeze. The owner should be consulted aboutstabling options for any horse that is a candidate forSPL placement to assure that the housing condi-tions are optimal for SPL function.Insertion of a SPL requires heavy sedation, appro-priate restraint, and solid head support of the man-dible so the horse's head remains still during theinsertion process. The author prefers to place SPLsystems in the upper eyelid given that gravity willhelp the eye medication access the cornea. SPLsystems that are placed in the lower eyelid havebeen demonstrated to be as effective as upper-eyelidSPL systems, and may be easier for some practition- ers to place. 3,16Therefore, SPL systems can be placed in either eyelid according to practitioner pref-erence unless there is some mitigating circumstancethat requires placement in one lid or the other.The skin of the target eyelid is cleaned with 2% to5% dilute betadine solution proparacaine 0.5% oph-thalmic solution). An auriculopalpebral block isperformed and the skin in the region where the SPLtrochar will exit near the orbital rim is blocked bylocal inltration of 2 mL of lidocaine. Once the chosen eyelid and ocular surface has been prepped, the clinician puts on a pair of sterilegloves, after unfolding the sterile paper glove wrap-per on a table located near the sedated horse. Thecontents of the SPL kit are placed on the sterileglove wrapper surface. The coiled SPL tubing isunwound and gathered up in loops so it can be heldin one hand. The SPL tubing is either held by theclinician or supported by an assistant holding thetubing on the sterile wrapper. Insertion of the tub-ing is accomplished via the steps outlined in thelegend accompanying the photographs in Fig. 16.If the horse does not stand still when the clinicianapproaches the eyelid with the insertion trochar, theSPL tubing should be returned to the sterile glove Fig. 16. Placement of a SPL system. A, A right-handed clinician places the left index nger under the eyelid that will receive theSPL system (a left-handed clinician would use the right index nger). B, The SPL-system trochar is placed along the left index ngerand the nger/trochar is carefully inserted under the eyelid and deep into in the conjunctival fornix (upper eyelid) or cul-de-sac of thenasal canthus (lower eyelid). The dominant hand is used to push the trochar into the conjunctiva, subcutaneous tissue and skin ina smooth, quick motion. C, When the SPL-trochar has pierced the skin, the rest of the tubing system is pulled through the eyelid untilthe SPL footplate is located in the conjunctival fornix. (Photographs courtesy of Dr. Christie Wards, University of Minnesota .) 150 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO the levels of sedation, block, or topicalanesthesia should be optimized. After the trochar has been used to pull the tubing through the hole that has pierced the eyelid, specialcare is taken to assure that the footplate of the SPLis snug against the palpebral conjunctiva and thatthe angle of the footplate matches the angle of thepalpebral conjunctiva. Once the SPL tubing is placed, the clinician must verify that the tubing hole is deep in the fornix sothe footplate cannot abrade the corneal surface.To assess placement the tubing near the exit site ispulled gently to see if the eyelid moves. If the eye-lid moves there is a good chance that the SPL foot-plate has not been placed correctly and there is ahigh risk for the system to rub against the corneaand cause corneal ulcerations. If the footplate hasnot been correctly placed, the SPL system should bereplaced with the trochar inserted deeper into thefornix adjacent to the orbital rim (Fig. 17A). After the clinician is certain that the SPL foot- plate has been inserted correctly, the remainder ofthe SPL tubing must be secured to the face andmane as illustrated in Fig. 16. Securing the SPLtubing system is just as important as placing itcorrectly, given that a piece of dangling SPL tubingcan catch on a stall obstacle and break, or develop akink that will not allow medication to flow to thetear lm. The SPL tubing is anchored to the horse's face with simple interrupted sutures placed through but-terfly tabs made of porous white tape that are xedto the tubing. 2-0 Nylon suture on a straight cut-ting needle is used to place the simple interruptedsutures (Fig. 17B). The distal end of the tubing isthreaded with a 20-gauge 1 14-in. catheter and then capped with a male catheter cap that will serve asan injection port. A half wooden tongue depressoris used as a splint. The tongue depressor is coveredwith white tape to attach the SPL port to the mane(Fig. 17C). This IV injection port should be evalu-ated daily for sterility. A 1-mL syringe with an attached 25-gauge 5/8-in. needle is used to inject medication into the SPLsystem. Treatment is done by injecting 0.1 to 0.2mL of medication into the injection port, then push-ing the medication to the tear lm by slowly inject-ing a 1-3 mL bolus of air, depending of the length ofthe SPL tubing. A 3-mL syringe attached to a 25-gauge 5/8-in. needle is used for the air injection.Saline or water is not recommended as a means ofpushing the medication bolus to the tear lm asliquids dilute the medication and decrease efcacy.It is recommended that medications be administeredto the eye at a minimum of 5-minute intervals. Maintenance of an SPL system: The SPL system should be checked daily if the horse is hospitalized.The underlying ophthalmic disease will dictate thefrequency of veterinary examinations but the sys-tem should be checked by a veterinarian at leastweekly. Suture integrity of the white tape tabs on Fig. 17. Correct placement and securing of the SPL system isimportant. A, The SPL system should be placed in the conjunc-tival fornix (deepest part of the eyelid) and come out in the areaof the orbital rim (white arrow). The eyelid should not movewhen slight tension is applied to the tubing adjacent to the exithole. B, The SPL system should be anchored to the horse's facewith white porous tape and sutures. Nylon 2-0 suture with astraight cutting needle is used to suture the porous tape tabs tothe forehead of the horse. The SPL tubing is braided into thehorse mane to prevent dangling SPL tubing. C, Half of a woodentongue depressor is used as a splint to attach the SPL injectionport to the mane. The tongue depressor is covered with whitetape to protect silicone tubing. A 20-gauge 1 14-in. catheter and male catheter cap have been threaded into the end of the siliconetubing to facilitate treatment.

It is also benecial to flushthe SPL system with 3-5 mL of sterile saline peri-odically to ensure patency of the system and theabsence of holes. The male catheter cap injectionport should be changed regularly. If the tubing onthe SPL system breaks or develops a hole, it can besplinted using a 20-gauge intravenous catheter.Details of the tubing repair process, as well as othertips for eld maintenance of SPL systems can befound in a paper in a previous AAEP proceedings. 17 Removal: When the SPL system is ready to be removed, the horse may need to be sedated and theconjunctiva and cornea should be ophthalmic solu-tion). An auriculopalpebral nerve block beneeded, many horses allow removal without re-gional anesthesia. The SPL tubing is cut a fewinches above the eyelid exit hole. A sterile glove isplaced on the clinician's dominant hand. The indexnger and thumb are inserted and the footplate ispulled away from the conjunctiva. The severedtubing is pulled retrograde through the eyelid skinand the remainder of the SPL system is then re-moved from the face and mane. 2 Occasionally, when the SPL system has been in place for a long period of time the SPL-footplate iscovered with conjunctiva. In this case, the SPL-footplate will have to be removed through the exithole in the eyelid. The exit hole region should becleaned with 2% to 5% betadine solution and thearea is blocked with inltration of the skin withlidocaine. A No. 15 blade is used to cut a small linethat extends from the exit hole to 1 to 2 mm on eachside of the SPL-tube. The SPL-footplate is loosenedfrom the conjunctiva and subcutaneous tissue bygently pulling the attached tubing from one side toanother until the footplate can be removed throughthe exit hole. This may take time, but it is impor-tant not to pull too fast, given that the tubing systemcan break and leave the SPL-footplate buried in thesubcutaneous tissue, which will require opening theexit hole wider to locate the plate. The approach toremove the buried footplate must be performedthrough the skin as the space between the corneaand the palpebral conjunctiva is too narrow to per-mit removal the conjunctival side. Postprocedure treatment: The author recom- mends using topical triple ophthalmic antibiotic ointment gthree times a day for 3 days after removal of a SPL system, and administers oral NSAIDS (e.g.,flunixin meglumine) for 2 days to address potentialswelling and discomfort. A hard-cup hood is kepton for 3 to 5 days after removal of a SPL system todecrease risk of rubbing the face and eye. Complications: In rare cases, cellulitis/blephari- tis can occur after a SPL system is placed (Fig. 18).In these cases, the SPL system should be removedand the area should be hot/cold packed for a coupleof days. Collection of samples for culture/sensitiv-ity from the exit hole or infected site is recom-mended if there are concerns about infection. Thehorse should be started on systemic antibiotic (e.g.,TMS) for 5 to 7 days. Most eyelid cellulitis casesare sterile and will resolve within a couple of daysafter the SPL system has been removed. A differ-ent SPL system should be placed in the oppositeeyelid (upper vs lower eyelid) and will not usuallycause cellulitis/blepharitis in the new target eyelid. 6. Take-Home Message Standing surgery of the periocular region in horsesinvolves a set of clinical skills that are often neededby equine practitioners to treat common eld condi- tions. Study of anatomy, instrumentation, and sim-ple microsurgical techniques will enhance clinical outcomes. Preparation for surgery is importantand involves sedation, patient restraint, head sup-port, and prudent tissue handling. Practitionersthat are interested in performing standing periocu-lar surgeries should master the clinical skills that Fig. 18.

Dwyer, DVM Corneal cytology is an essential diagnostic test for cases of ulcerative keratitis, and obtaining acorneal cytology sample is easily performed in the eld. Microscopic evaluation of stained sampleswill demonstrate presence or absence of inflammation, infection, or noncellular elements. Interpre-tation of this evidence combined with the clinical examination and tests such as culture/sensitivityguides prudent therapy and rational management of a variety of ocular surface diseases. Author'saddress: Genesee Valley Equine the ovoid transparent portionof the outer tunic of the globe that serves as a \"win-dow\" that admits light into the eye. The normalhorse cornea is very thin, with a central depth ofslightly less than 1 mm. The horizontal corneal di-ameter is a little less than 35 mm and the verticalheight is slightly less than 25 mm. The precorneal tear lm forms a boundary layer between the air andthe outer epithelial cell layer. The epithelium,which makes up approximately 15% of the totalcorneal thickness, consists of 8-12 layers of nonke-ratinized stratied squamous cells. A basementmembrane below epithelium forms interfacebetween the epithelium and the thickest thecornea, the stroma. The stroma, which comprisesover 80% of the corneal depth, is predominantlycollagen brils, which are arranged in a geometri-cally precise lamellar extracellular matrix studdedwith a sparse, tiered net of keratocytes. Descem-et's membrane is the basement membrane that isadjacent to the base of the stromal tissue. Thiselastic membrane abuts with the deepest layer ofthe cornea, the endothelium, a very thin monolayerof cells that functions as the outer barrier of theanterior chamber. The endothelium provides anactive osmotic gradient that nourishes the cornea,yet keeps the stroma relatively dehydrated andtransparent. 1 Ulcerative disease of the cornea, which by deni- tion means segmental loss of corneal epitheliumthat may or may not involve a deeper stromal defect,is very common in horses. Diagnosis of ulcerativedisease involves application of fluorescein dye to theocular surface. The green dye will stain areas ofthe hydrophilic stroma that are denuded of epithe-lium. In rare cases where the ulcer depth has pen-etrated the entire depth of the stroma down toDescemet's membrane, the bottom of the ulcertrough will lack stain uptake and appear as a darkring outlined by dye staining the adjacent stroma. Equine corneal ulcers are often complicated by infection with bacterial or fungal pathogens. Someulcers become chronic due to the presence of foreignbodies. Others are compromised by the inflamma- /H11408AAEP inltrate the ocular surface. These in-flammatory cells release proteases into the tear lmthat digest stromal collagen, causing the cornealtissue to swell and melt. Some ulcers fail to heal due to mineral deposition or failure of new epithelialcells to properly anchor to the basement membraneand underlying stroma. Such complications threatencorneal transparency and jeopardize vision. Corneal ulcers are often accompanied by severe ocular pain, and are a frequent reason that veteri-narians are summoned for emergency calls. Manyulcerative conditions advance rapidly and can prog-ress to blinding sequelae. Accurate, rapid assess-ment of the status of the affected region of the ocularsurface is a critical part of the diagnosis of cornealulcers. Successful resolution of corneal ulcers re-quires targeted therapy that is specic for the un-derlying condition. Obtaining a corneal cytology is a simple stall- side procedure that provides essential informationneeded to prescribe rational therapy. The materi-als needed for cytology sampling are inexpensiveand readily available. Clinicians or technicianscan readily learn to recognize corneal cytology pro-les that suggest infection, inflammation, or otherabnormal conditions. A rapid diagnosis of the mi-croenvironment of the affected ocular surface leadsto a targeted treatment plan that may be sightsaving. 2,3 2. Materials and Methods The following materials are required to obtain acorneal cytology sample in the eld: 2% povidone iodine solution in a pour bottle (to clean periorbit) 4/H110034 gauze squares (to clean periorbit) Sedation (xylazine Small pair of gloves Sampling instrument: scalpel blade (size Nos. 10-15), kimura spatula, or cytobrush Two to four microscope slides with frosted ends Pencil to label slides Plastic slotted microscope box Sterile cotton-tipped wooden swabs (to com- plete corneal debridement after cytology sam-ple is obtained) These items can be stocked with other supplies in adesignated ophthalmic tote box in the ambulatoryvehicle. Most practitioners use scalpel blades as a sam- pling tool for corneal cytology. Blade size Nos. 10,11, 12, or 15 can be used, given that only the bluntbase of the blade is used. Individual blades shouldbe placed in peel-away autoclave pouches and ster-ilized ahead of time to assure that the outer foilwrapper, which is used as a handle for the bladebase and a cover for the sharp part of the blade, issterile during sampling (Fig. 1). Some cliniciansprefer Kimura spatulas inpeel-away pouches. Disposable cytobrushes that are sold in sterile paper packages can be used as sampling tools, butbrushes may not generate sufcient surface pres-sure on the cornea to dislodge an adequate sample ofcells for analysis. Most clinicians prefer using ametal tool for corneal sampling because it can beapplied to a precise area of the cornea, and a bluntblade dislodges a generous sampling of material.However, the pressure generated by a metal instru-ment may risk damaging the cornea in globes withvery deep or melting ulcers that are tectonicallyunstable. In these cases, sampling can be per-formed with a cytobrush or Dacron-tipped swab. It should be noted that cotton-tipped wooden swabs are not appropriate tools for obtaining cytol-ogy samples. There are two reasons for this: 1)swab sampling tends to yield insufcient samplevolume, and 2) cotton threads from the swab headinevitably end up on the slide, creating artifacts thatconfuse interpretation. However, ve to ten sterilecotton-tipped wooden swabs are needed to debridethe corneal lesion cytology sampling iscompleted. Peel-away autoclave pouches can beused to sterilize small numbers of swabs for thispurpose. Fig. 1. Single scalpel blades can be autoclaved in sealed pouchesto assure sterility for cytology sampling. Cytobrushes can alsobe used as sampling /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 155HOW TO SESSION: OPHTHALMOLOGYPreparation of the Examination Area Field corneal cytology sampling is usually carriedout in a barn aisle or stall doorway. The areashould be clean, well lit, and wind free. Horsesthat require corneal cytology often need additionalprocedures such as subconjunctival lesiondebridement, or subpalpebral lavage system place-ment. Volume of sedation and time to complete alltests and procedures is minimized if the cliniciantakes a few minutes to stage the examination areaand set up all needed supplies prior to any handlingor sedation of the horse. Items for corneal cytology should be laid out on one or two folding tables located close to the patient,along with any other materials needed for evalua-tion or treatment of the case. One or two 3-mLsyringes designated for periocular nerve block(s)should be lled with needle. syringeshould be lled with 0.5-1.0 mL of topical anes-thetic and capped with a 25-gauge needle that hashad the needle stem broken off to expose the hubbase (Fig. 2). Two to four glass slides are taken out of the storage box and placed on the table. The frosted end of eachslide is labeled with the patient name, owner name,date, and the eye being sampled (ocular sinister-OS-left eye or ocular dexter-OD-right eye). The innersurface of the open paper surgical glove wrapper pro-vides a convenient sterile surface to place the sam-pling tool after it is removed from the autoclavedpouch. The clinician should construct a table that will support the sedated horse's mandible on a solid sur-face at a height just above the point of the horse'sshoulder. Materials such as stacked bales coveredwith a blanket, oil drums, or recycling bins makeexcellent head supports. The ocular surface needsto be well lit during the sampling process; visualiza-tion will be aided if the clinician dons a headlamp orif an assistant provides supplemental ocular surfacelighting with a flashlight or Finoff transilluminator. Preparation of the Patient Intravenous sedation is administered after \"examroom staging\" is complete. Choice of sedative de-pends on the temperament of the horse, the degreeof ocular pain, and the length and invasive nature ofthe sequence of procedures that will be performed.Xylazine at a dose of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg is usually adequatefor quiet horses that do not require additional globemanipulation. Detomidine hydrochloride aat a dose of 0.02-0.04 mg/kg will be required for horses thatare very painful, or for those who need a lavagesystem placed. After sedation is administered, the horse is posi- tioned so that the mandible rests on the head sup-port that was prepared. The handler stands on theside opposite to the eye destined for sampling, hold-ing a lead rope snapped to the halter. If the lesionof interest is located near the superior limbus, thehandler is instructed to tip the horse's head awayfrom the clinician when sampling starts; oculoves-tibular motion induced by the oblique head positionwill rotate the target area into optimum position forlesion access. Gauze sponges soaked with 2% povidone iodine solution are used to clean the periorbital region.Upper eyelid akinesia is achieved by with a 25-gauge, 5/8-in. nee-dle over the palpebral branch of the auriculopalpe-bral nerve. This nerve can be accessed just lateralto the highest point of the caudal zygomatic arch orin the ventral curve of the rostral zygomatic archjust caudal to the bony process of the frontal bone.Regional analgesia is achieved by injecting 1 mL oflocal anesthetic with a 25-gauge, 5/8-in. needle sub-cutaneously over the frontal nerve as it emergesfrom the supraorbital foramen in the frontal bonesuperior and temporal to the nasal canthus. Digital photography of the corneal surface should be performed prior to cytologic sampling to docu-ment the presenting condition. Imaging of the cor-nea after cytologic sampling may also be useful todocument any surface disruption that follows lesiondebridement. 4,5 Topical ophthalmic surface staining with sodium fluorescein dye is indicated to demonstrate the ex-tent of ulcerative keratitis; this stain does not inter-fere with corneal cytology interpretation and can beperformed prior to cytologic sampling (Fig. 3). If corneal culture and sensitivity testing is indi- cated, it is performed prior to cytology sampling orsurface stain administration. Ideally, culture shouldbe performed prior to topical anesthesia, but uncoop- erative or very painful patients will require topicalanesthetic application prior to culture. Culture of Fig. 2. Materials for corneal cytology should be sent out on aclean table prior to sedation of the patient. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO SESSION: a sterile,moistened Dacron or calcium alginate-tipped swabor with the blunt end of a sterile scalpel blade.It is always best to assess ulcerative problems witha combination of culture and cytology, but cliniciansshould be aware that many cases of infectious ker-atitis fail to grow organisms on culture, either be-cause of previous anti-infective therapy, or thepresence of a fastidious pathogen that does not growin vitro. Topical anesthesia will be necessary for corneal cytology. The syringe that has been loaded withproparicaine or tetracaine and tted with a 25-gauge needle hub is used to gently spray or drip avolume of 0.5 mL of anesthetic onto the cornealsurface. Steps of the Sampling Process Corneal cytology and subsequent surface debride-ment are simple procedures that add no more than afew minutes to the ocular examination/treatmentprocess. The clinician dons gloves and opens and folds the foil wrapper of the sampling blade so as to exposethe blade base but keep the sharp end of the bladecovered. The thumb and index nger of the non-dominant hand are used to hold the horse's eyelidsapart. The dominant hand is used to position theblade (or spatula edge) on the cornea at the edge ofthe lesion at a 45\u00b0 angle. The metal edge is thenscraped in a rm but gentle stroke across the dis-rupted corneal surface several times (Fig. 4). Theblade edge is examined to assure that surface mate-rial is present. The blade is then positioned at a45\u00b0 angle to the middle of the glass slide andsmeared in an even stroke to deposit material ontothe slide surface in a monolayer. The samplingprocess is repeated a few times until material thatlooks like flakes of dandruff can be easily identiedon the slide. The hand motion of dislodging and thesample from the corneal surface and depositing itonto the slide can be compared with that used whenfrosting a cake. One to three additional slides are prepared in a similar manner. The clinician should choose a largernumber of slides if cytologic analysis by a referencelaboratory is anticipated in addition to in-house ex- amination. The slides are stored in the plastic slot-ted box after each is examined to assure that asufcient sample has been obtained. The slideswill air dry in the box and can be stained at the endof the day (Fig. 5). After the cytology sample is obtained, the corneal surface will need additional debridement to removedevitalized or disrupted epithelium. Five to tensterile cotton-tipped wooden swabs are used for de-bridement. The swabs are used dry to permit thefriction that is generated as the cotton tip is appliedto the ocular surface to remove all loose epithelium.The swabs are rmly swept against the corneal sur-face in a motion that mimics writing on a chalkboardor using a pencil eraser. When a swab becomes wetwith tears, it is replaced with a new dry swab.Debridement continues until probing with a dryswab proves that the border of the ulcerated lesion istightly adherent to the underlying stroma. Staining Corneal Cytology Slides The following items are required to perform in-house cytology: Fig. 3. Ulcerative keratitis cases should be evaluated by cornealcytology as well as culture.

The stains are stored in capped Co-pley jars or other containers with airtight screwtops, and the rapid staining process involves expos-ing the slide to three solutions in sequence. Therst jar (Diff-Quik Solution 1) contains a light bluexative reagent consisting of methanol and triaryl-methane dye; this solution xes the material on theslide surface. The second jar (Diff-Quik Solution 2)is a red buffered solution containing xanthene dyeand sodium azide. This jar stains cellular elementsthat are eosinophilic. The third jar (Diff-Quik So-lution 3) is a dark blue buffered solution containingthiazine dye. This solution stains cellular elementsthat are basophilic. Table 1 outlines the stainingcharacteristics of epithelial cells, blood cells, andother elements that may be found on corneal cytol-ogy samples (Fig. 6). Diff-Quik stain was developed as a rapid \"dip\" commercial Romanovsky staining method. Thestain provides good cytoplasmic detail and alsostains many common microbiologic agents and ex-tracellular elements. Opinions vary on the opti-mum staining process for corneal samples. Mostclinicians use a method where the slide is dippedseveral times in xative, holding the slide in thesolution for 1 second per dip, then the short distaledge of the slide is tapped on a paper towel to wickoff excess stain solution. The process is then re-peated with a number of dips in Diff-Quik Solution 2(red), followed by tapping the slide on the papertowel, then by a number of brief 1-second dips inDiff-Quik Solution 3 (dark blue). Many veterinarians are taught to perform \"ve dips\" of the slide in each stain solution, with eachdip lasting 1 second. The author prefers to dip theslide sixtimes in the xative, then sixtimes in the red Diff-Quik Solution 2, and then twelve times in the dark blue Diff-Quik Solution 3. The longer im-mersion in the third jar yields superior cytologicdetail and staining of structures like fungal hyphae.Some cytologists prefer an immersion techniquewhere the slide is placed in the xative for 3 min-utes, then in the red solution for 1 minute, then inthe dark blue solution for 3 minutes. 6 The stained slide is then gently rinsed in a thin stream of water that is run from a faucet or rinsingbottle, and is propped vertically on the short edge todry. Drying time may be facilitated by placing theslide in an incubator set at body temperature, or bypropping the unstained rear surface of the slide infront of a mild stream of warm air such as thatproduced by a manicure machine designed to dryfreshly applied ngernail polish. Microscopic Examination Once the slide is dry it is examined under the mi-croscope. All areas that harbor stained materialshould be examined methodically. The slide is rstinspected under low (10 /H11003) magnication to assess the pattern of material that is stained and to look forlarge foreign bodies. Then the slide is scannedfrom one end to the other under \"high dry\" (40/H11003)magnication. Finally, the slide is examined underthe high-power (100 /H11003) lens with a drop of oil placed over the stained material that is in contact with thelens surface. The examiner will take the longesttime with the latter lens given that high magnica-tion is needed to visualize cellular detail and micro-organisms. It may be necessary to flip back andforth between low power and oil immersion to besure that all relevant areas on the slide are in-spected. Usually the slide will contain \"rafts\" ofmultilayered sections of corneal epithelium as wellas individual or small groups of cells spread out in amonolayer. The small clusters of cells usually yieldthe most diagnostic information. The task of examining corneal cytology samples is greatly simplied if the examiner remembers that anormal sample from the corneal surface should con-tain only squamous epithelial cells. These cells re-semble fried eggs and may be seen in mosaic sheetsor as small groups of cells on the slide. Supercialepithelial cells are flattened whereas basal cells tendto be cylindrical shapes. The cytoplasm of cornealepithelial cells stains light to medium blue in color.Nuclei are round to oval, basophilic, and centrally Fig. 5. Cytology sample is immediately transferred to a glassslide, checked to assure that particulate matter is visible on theslide. The slide is then labeled and placed in a plastic slotted boxfor transport. 158 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW OPHTHALMOLOGYTable 1.

AAEP 63 other than rafts or smallgroups of corneal epithelial cells is worth noting. If bacteria are found on the slide, and are judged to be signicant (abundant, and uniform, whetherextracellular or intracellular), a separate slideshould undergo standard gram staining. The re-cord should then note whether the bacteria assumeda Gram positive (blue to purple) or Gram negative(red to pink) stain prole. It should be noted thatinterpretation of a sample of corneal cytology thathas been Gram stained may be challenging, unlessbacteria are very abundant and obvious. The examiner records the ndings of the cytology examination on a digital or paper medical record.It is helpful to prepare a template that has a check-list of common ndings to assure that all pertinentdetail is included. Elements of the record shouldinclude notation of the types of cells that are pres-ent, whether any microorganisms or foreign bodiesare observed, and the staining pattern and shape ofany abnormal organisms or structures. Artifactssuch as stain precipitate or melanin granules shouldbe noted (Fig. 7). 3. Results The most common reason that corneal cytology isperformed in horses is to assess ulcerative keratitis.Interpretation is guided by considering three simplequestions: 1. Is there an inflammatory inltrate (presence of neutrophils, eosinophils, or monocytes)? 2. Are infectious elements (bacteria or fungi) present? If bacteria are seen, are they intra-cellular or extracellular, rods or cocci? 3. Are any foreign bodies (vegetative material, mineralized crystals, other object) present? The following descriptions outline ten proles thatare commonly seen in cytology samples taken fromulcerative lesions: 1. Corneal epithelial cells with normal nuclei. Slide shows no inflammatory inltrate, nomicroorganisms, and no foreign bodies: Cy- that lacksinflammation. is chronic, itmay be an indolent ulcer. Indolent debridement with a diamondburr instrument; a noninfectious cytologyprole provides evidence that this kind ofdebridement is a safe therapeutic choice 7 (Fig. 8).Table 2.

Corneal epithelial cells with intracellular bacteria. The bacteria are uniform in shape and staining characteristics . This prole is evidence of an infectious etiology. The shape and staining prole of the bacteria will sug-gest therapeutic agents that are logicalchoices pending the results of culture andsensitivity: Gram-positive infections mayrespond well to topical drugs such as cefazo-lin, chloramphenicol, or fluoroquinolones,whereas Gram-negative infections may re- spond well topical aminoglycosides orfluoroquinolones. Bacteria may be foundwithin the cytoplasm of epithelial cells orneutrophils 10(Fig. 11 ). 5. Corneal epithelial cells with normal nuclei. A uniform population of extracellular bacte-ria are present in large numbers and neutro-phils are abundant . This prole is strongly suggestive of an infectious etiology (Fig. 12). 6. Corneal epithelial cells with normal nuclei. Occasional areas with extracellular bacteria;mix of shapes and staining pattern. This prole is less suggestive of an infectious eti-ology, but topical therapy should still includeanti-infectives and an anticollagenase prod-uct. Sequential sampling may be needed toreassess. 7. Corneal epithelial cells with normal nuclei. Fungal hyphae are present and can be foundin both the thicker rafts of epithelium andamidst the small groups of cells in thinnermonolayers . This prole is absolute proof of mycotic keratitis, a very serious condition thatrequires aggressive, expensive therapy. Thecytology conrms the need for antifungal agents as well as a topical anticollagenaseproduct 11(Fig. 13 ). 8. Corneal epithelial cells with normal nuclei; multiple large pale blue ovoid structures inthe cytoplasm of some cells. If the horse has been on topical ointment therapy and theulcer is not healing in a timely fashion, thisprole suggests that the epithelial cells havetaken up globules of the oily petroleum basematerial. Switching therapy from topicalointments to solutions may be benecial. Fig. 8. Normal corneal epithelial cells are large cells with roundcentral nuclei that stain blue to violet with Diff-Quik.

Presence of vegetative foreign body embedded in a raft of corneal epithelial cells. This nding may present proof that the cytologicdebridement process has effected a cure byremoving the offending agent. If the lesion Fig. 10.

The eosino-phil, which is packed with large pink refractile granules, is adja-cent to a cluster of epithelial cells packed with intracellularbacteria (Diff-Quik stain, 100 /H11003). Fig. 11. Corneal epithelial cells packed with intracellular rod-shaped bacteria (Diff Quik stain, 100/H11003). Fig. 12. Corneal cytology sample showing large numbers of ex-tracellular cocci as well cytokeratin provides evidence to supportfurther debridement to remove additionalembedded material (Fig. 15). Corneal epithelial cells that are pleomorphic (vari-able in size) and show anisokaryosis (variable-sizenuclei) as well as a variable number of nucleoli,variable staining, and/or a varying ratio of nucleusto cytoplasm are suggestive of neoplasia. Cornealneoplasia is relatively rare in the horse, but suspi-cion of neoplasia is another reason that cytology maybe performed. Interpretation of potentially neo-plastic tissue is beyond the scope of this review;clinicians are urged to send such samples to refer-ence laboratories. 4. Discussion As with any clinical pathology procedure, inade-quate technique or the presence of certain artifactsor pathologic ndings may hamper interpretation ofcorneal cytology. The most common problem is aninsufcient sample of cells on the slide. Inex-perienced clinicians may be timid about applying ablunt metal blade to the corneal surface, fearingthat excessive force will cause damage. Some ul-cerative lesions exfoliate cellular material duringscraping that is difcult to \"trap\" on the blade sur-face. In either case the resultant cytology slidesmay not contain a sample of sufcient quality. Training in effective corneal scraping methods can be accomplished by practicing cytology collection oncadaver eyes. To do this, the sharp edge of a No. 15scalpel blade is used to create a small ulcer on thenormal intact epithelium of the cadaver cornea.The operator will note that the epithelium on thecorneal surface is tough, requiring sharp dissectionfor disruption. A practice cytology sample can thenbe taken from the iatrogenic ulcer bed. The scalpelblade is flipped in the foil wrapper and the bluntedge is scraped along the ulcer margins to prepareseveral slides as described. The operator can thenstain the slides to compare the amount of materialthat was grossly visible on the slide with the amountof stained material that is evident through the mi-croscope. This exercise will help the clinician gain Fig. 13. Fungal hyphae and spores conrm a diagnosis of my-cotic keratitis. Fungal elements branch and hyphae are septatewith parallel Degenerate neutrophils and epithelial celldebris are present (Diff Quik stain, 100/H11003). Fig. 14. Geometric shapes representing crystals of hydroxyapa-tite are present. When this sample was taken a is embedded within a raft of cornealepithelium, comfort with the amount of pressurerequired at the ulcer edge to dislodge and trap par-ticulate material resembling flakes of dandruff. Another issue that can confound interpretation is the presence of basophilic Diff-Quik stain precip- itate that has adhered to rafts of cells or to \"empty\" portions of the slide. Solution 3 (blue) Diff-Quikstain will form precipitates in solution if it is old orif the container has been used to stain a lot of slides,and these tiny clumps of material will adhere to cellson the stained slides. The small dark blue particlesare very hard to distinguish from bacterial cocci;thus, the presence of stain precipitate on a slide canproduce a false-positive diagnosis of bacterial kera-titis (Fig. 16). Two quality-control practices willhelp prevent this issue: frequent changing of thestain solution in the staining jars, and periodic l-tration of the two stain solutions through lter pa-per. Laboratories that do a lot of cytology may keepa separate set of stain jars reserved just for ocularsample staining. The solutions should be changedat weekly to monthly intervals, depending on thefrequency of use. At each change date, the coplinjars should be cleaned with soapy water, dried thor-oughly, and labeled with the date. A short neckfunnel lined with 110 mm lter paper folded into acone can be used as a straining device to removeparticles that accumulate between solution changedates. A third issue that affects interpretation of certain cytology samples is the presence of melanin gran- ules within the corneal epithelial cells. Like stain precipitate, the small granules can easily be con-fused with bacterial cocci. However, examinationof the patient prior to sampling should prepare theoperator for this nding. The two types of caseswhere this artifact may occur are in samples thatare taken on or very near the limbus (where melaninis a natural presence in and around the limbalepithelial cells) or in samples that have pigmentinltrate in the normally transparent region ofthe perilimbal or axial cornea. There is no way toavoid melanin granules in such cases, but thepre-sampling examination should anticipate thisnding, and the slides should be interpreted accord-ingly. Melanin granules demonstrate a golden-brown or greenish hue, where bacteria usually staindark blue with Diff-Quik (Fig. 17). The presence ofan inflammatory response is suggestive of bacterialinvolvement. Still, it may be difcult to distinguishthe difference between melanin granules and coccoidbacteria. A fourth issue that is a common source of confu- sion is the presence of cytokeratin cellular de- bris, cell fragments representing strands of nuclearchromatin. This nding is common in cases of in-fectious keratitis or keratomalacia; it follows wide- spread cellular rupture. The chromatin from thedead cells spins out into long thin tangles of nuclearmaterial. The basophilic cytokeratin strands,which can be a very dominant feature on the slide inlongstanding cases, form nets that trap cellular ma-terial. The strands, which are essentially tanglesof DNA, are often confused with fungal hyphae.It may be necessary to examine multiple regions ofthe slide to decide if basophilic linear strands arecytokeratin or hyphae. Cytokeratin looks more like Fig. 16. Granular stain precipitate in cytology sample. Theprecipitate tends to form stellate clumps. Individual granulesmay be confused with coccoid bacteria. Stain solutions should bechanged and ltered regularly to avoid this confusing artifact(Diff Quik, 100/H11003). Fig. 17. Melanin granules are present on this cytology sample,taken from a lesion near the limbus. The granules stain green-ish black to brown and form clusters that may overlie the epithe-lial cell nuclei. They are easily confused with bacteria (DiffQuik, 164 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO strands of cotton candy (Fig.18). Fungal hyphae will show the hallmark char-acteristics of parallel walls, septate hyphae, andbranching elements (Fig. 19). Clinicians and technicians can become accurate assessors of corneal cytology if they keep the afore-mentioned information about artifacts and elementsthat can mimic infectious agents in mind. As arule, corneal cytology is indicated in all but the mostsupercial, acute ulcers. Corneal cytology is espe-cially indicated in chronic cases where there is anopaque region that represents an inltrate associatedwith the ulcer. Serious cases of ulcerative keratitisoften require weeks to months of therapy, and se- quential cytologic sampling may be needed. Thereare no hard and fast rules of ulcer management/debridement frequency, but most clinicians wait ap-proximately 1 week to decide whether additionaldebridement and/or cytology is necessary, unless theulcer is deteriorating rapidly. Cytology is also in-dicated if a clinician decides they need to debride anarea that is not ulcerated, such as a vascularizedregion associated with chronic ocular discomfort. There are a few instances when corneal cytology with the blade technique is ill advised. Ulcers withsevere, progressive keratomalacia are best assessedby rolling a cytobrush over the malacic tissue, or bymaking an impression smear by pressing the centerof a slide onto the melting cornea. Similarly, it isnot prudent to perform blade sampling on a desme-tocele or extremely deep ulcer that has the potentialto rupture. As mentioned previously, interpretation of neo- plastic cytology samples is beyond the skillset ofmost clinicians. Samples suspicious for neoplasiaare best sent to clinical pathology reference labora-tories. However, the clinician can make extraslides when debriding such cases, stain them in-house, and compare the observations they makewith those of the clinical pathology report. Thispractice educates the clinician and provides a base-line for subsequent progress exams. In the samevein, clinicians who do not have a lot of experiencewith corneal cytology of nonneoplastic conditions willgain condence in their interpretative skills if theymake multiple slides of the rst several cases theydebride, and send one set of slides to a reference lab-oratory and analyze the second set themselves. Many clinicians take photographs of interesting cytology ndings through the microscope. Moderncell phones contain tiny camera lenses that captureexcellent images through the ocular lens of the mi-croscope; good results can be obtained with practice(Fig. 20). Cytology images can be inserted into themedical record, or shared with colleagues for consul-tation purposes. Simple and practical techniquesfor photographing microscopic images using cellphones or digital cameras have been described. 4,5 Collection and interpretation of corneal cytology samples to evaluate ulcerative keratopathy is sim-ple and straightforward. It is easy for cliniciansand technicians to attain skills in reading slidesstained with Diff-Quik stain. Analysis of mostcommon problems involves assessing the ocularsurface sample to look for infection, inflammatoryresponse, and/or the presence of extracellular ele-ments like mineral or foreign bodies. Same-dayanalysis of cytology samples from horses suffering Fig. 18. Cytokeratin strands representing cytoplasmic contentsthat have been spun out from the nuclei of ruptured cornealepithelial cells. Commonly seen in samples of chronic ulcerativekeratitis. Threadlike character can be confused with fungal hy-phae, but cytokeratin elements lack parallel walls, septate do not fungal hyphae. Negative staining pattern disease promotes selection of ratio-nal therapy that may be sight saving and guidesproper management of cases that are chronic ornonresponsive.

Introduction The equine cornea is prone to ulceration due to alarge surface area, lateral protrusion of the globes,and environmental conditions that present a widerange of corneal weapons. Equine corneal ulcer-ation is the most common ophthalmic condition apractitioner will see in the eld. Most corneal trau-mas produce a simple surface abrasion that healswithin a few days. If corneal healing is rapid, op-timal ocular function, corneal clarity, and comfortwill be restored. 1However, other traumas are more extensive, threatening corneal integrity. Notall ulcers are simple to treat, and owners may notalways seek prompt veterinary attention. Com-plications to healing may occur due to cornealinfection, keratomalacia, disruption in epithelialadhesion, and other pathologies. Infection can be one reason that a corneal ulcer fails to heal. Clinical signs of an infection such ascorneal cellular inltrate, stromal loss, corneal melt-ing, and signicant uveitis diagnostics tocheck for the presence of pathogens. Selection ofantimicrobial treatments should be based on cytol-ogy and culture. Cytology is a simple procedurethat provides rapid information to guide rationalselection of antimicrobials and other appropriatetherapy. Culture is recommended for all cases ofslow healing corneal ulceration with cellular inl-trate, stromal loss, or keratomalacia. Please seenotes by Dr. Ann Dwyer on cytology of the equinecornea for recommendations on sampling andinterpretation. 2 It is important to realize that not all corneal ulcers are infected, and that many noninfectious patholo-gies can cause an ulcer to be slow to heal. Allcorneal ulcers require careful examination and ap-propriate diagnostic tests to assess presence or ab-sence of infection and determine whether the ulceris accompanied by corneal mineralization, eosino-philic inltrate, keratomalacia, or corneal edema.Selection of rational therapy should be based on athorough understanding of corneal healing princi-ples and on evaluation of the pathologic prole of thecase. Prompt institution of therapy targeted forthe specic examination ndings, coupled with se-lection of an effective route and schedule of treat-ment administration will decrease healing time andoptimize clinical outcome. Corneal Epithelial Wound Healing Ulcerations of the cornea normally start to healwithin hours of injury. First-tear concentrationsof enzymes such as basement membraneand decrease cellular adhesions to ease epithelialmigration. Excessive levels of proteases in the tearlm can, however, hinder healing. 1,3Damaged ep - ithelial cells go through apoptosis and the epithelialcells at the edges of the wound retract. The healthyepithelial cells surrounding the wound edge flattenout and spread over the denuded surface area.Migration of epithelial cells continues until thewound is covered in a single layer of cells. The rateof cell migration is approximately 0.6 mm a day in ahealthy cornea. 1,4,5 Healing continues after the wound is covered by a thin layer of epithelium. A proliferation phase oc-curs next where the normal architecture of multiplelayers of epithelium are created. During this phasethe corneal barrier function is re-established withformation of tight junctions, gap junctions, and des-mosomes between epithelial cells. 1The nal phase is epithelial reattachment when hemidesmosomesreassemble and anchor the epithelium to the ante-rior stroma. 1If the epithelial basement membrane was unaffected during the injury this attachmentoccurs within days, but if the basement membranewas damaged then re-establishment of normal epi-thelial anchoring can take weeks to months. 4 Complicated corneal wounds and chronic corneal ulceration often stimulate corneal neovasculariza-tion and/or cellular inltrate. Corneal neovascu-larization starts 3-5 days after the original injury.Vessels bud from the limbus and migrate at a rate of1 mm per day toward the wound. 4Visualization of vessels allows for a good estimate of the durationof the wound based on the vessel length. Cornealinltrate is seen as a white or yellow spot that rep-resents a focus of inltrating neutrophils. Theseinflammatory cells move into the corneal stromawithin the rst 12-24 hours of injury and migratetoward the wound at a rate of 8 mm a day. 1,4,5 Neutrophils liberate proteases that break downdamaged tissue and phagocytize cellular and non-cellular debris. Macrophages appear later to re-move debris. Diagnosis of Corneal Ulceration Clinical signs of ocular pain such as blepharospasm,epiphora, blepharoedema, are highly acorneal ulceration, but the diagnosis should not bemade without the conrmation of fluorescein stainuptake. Examination of the eye in a dark environ-ment with a cobalt blue light is strongly recom-mended because small lesions will be missed in abright environment. Sedation and auriculopalpe-bral nerve block are recommended to facilitate athorough examination of the wound and surrounding cornea. Application of fluorescein can be achieved by making a solution of stain by tearing off the orangeend of the dye strip and placing it in a 3-cc syringewith 1 mL of sterile saline, then breaking off theneedle from the hub and squirting the stain onto theeye. Alternatively, a moistened dye strip can betouched to the conjunctival surface of the eye. Amagnied view of the wound will help the examinerdetect any pathologies that are affecting healing. Pathologies that Affect Corneal Healing There are many pathologies that affect equine cor-neal wound healing. It is very important to recog-nize that many corneal wounds that are slow to healare not infected, but are complicated by poor cellularattachment, deposits of mineral within the corneallayers, allergic hypersensitivity/eosinophilic inl-tration, or endothelial dysfunction. Other subsetsof chronic ulcers are complicated by infection withbacterial or fungal pathogens, and/or progressivekeratomalacia. A correct diagnosis coupled withinstitution of rational therapy will decrease the du-ration of ocular pain, decrease treatment time, andcost and optimize the clinical outcome. Indolent (Nonhealing) Ulcer corneal ulcer or indolent ulcer ulcer that does not heal because the epi-thelial cells fail to adhere to the anterior stroma.There is abnormal adhesion due to the failure ofregeneration of the epithelial basement membraneand dysfunction of hemidesmosome attachments ofthe epithelial cells to the stroma. In some histologysamples of equine nonhealing ulcers there is a hya-line membrane covering the ulcer bed that preventsthe interaction needed to restore a healthy junctionbetween the epithelium and stroma. 1,6,7Repeat trauma to the epithelial basement membrane andanterior stroma due to the presence of an eyelidforeign body, eyelid suture, or subpalpebral lavagefootplate can also nonhealingulcers.DiagnosisA nonhealing or indolent corneal ulcer is observedclinically as a painful eye with a distinct cornealhaze. This area of corneal haze will have fluores-cein retention and stain will leak between the non-adherent epithelium and stroma under the edge ofthe obvious area of epithelial loss (Fig. 1). Repeatexamination 2-3 minutes after applying the stain tothe defect will demonstrate expansion of the area ofstain uptake under the loose edge. The vascularresponse is variable and if present, slow, but oftenthin, branching vessels are observed with chronicity.There must be absolutely no stromal thickness lossfor the diagnosis of an indolent ulcer. Indolent ul-cers are not infected; it is important to conrm theabsence of pathogenic organisms with cytology andculture prior to instituting treatment.TreatmentThe eyelids and conjunctiva should be inspected tocheck for any foreign body, hair, suture, or foot plate 168 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 SESSION: the cornea; if any are found,the offending object should be removed. Cytologyshould be performed to conrm absence of infection.Loose epithelium should be debrided with a series ofdry applicators after topical anes-thetic instillation. Cotton-tip debridement will notdisturb healthy epithelial cells that are adhered tothe stroma but loose cells will exfoliate due to fric-tion produced by a dry swab. Multiple sterile cot-ton tips will be required for thorough debridement,as tips that become soaked with tears will not beeffective. An additional step that can help disruptthe basement membrane is to use the handle end ofa scalpel blade to scrape the lesion. The debridedwound bed is then treated with broad-spectrum top-ical antibiotics and anticollagenase therapy. Ocu-lar pain is treated with topical atropine andsystemic NSAIDs. The ulcer should be recheckedin 1 week. If the ulcer is smaller at that point,topical and systemic treatment is continued and thelesion is rechecked again in 1-2 weeks. If the le-sion is unchanged at 1 week then diagnostic testsshould be repeated to look for complicating factors. Cotton-tip debridement should be the rst line of treatment for an indolent ulcer in the eld. If theulcer has not decreased in size after 2 weeks, thenreferral is recommended. The treatment options that can be offered by re- ferral centers or clinicians with extensive experiencein ophthalmology include a diamond-burr keratot-omy or a grid keratotomy. The diamond-burr ker-atotomy is the current treatment of choice to removethe nonadherent epithelial cells and disrupt anyhyaline membrane over the stroma. 8There is little risk of causing severe damage to the cornea with thediamond burr unless there is infection in the stroma.There is a slight risk of a thermal burn, which maybe avoided with conservative burring technique.The use of a grid keratotomy was a common treat-ment several years ago but is now strongly discour-aged in the horse, and has largely been replaced bythe diamond-burr procedure. The grid procedureinvolves using a sterile needle to excoriate the ante-rior stroma in a checkerboard pattern. Seriousrisks associated with this procedure include drag-ging a surface infection into the anterior stromaalong the grid marks 1and inadvertent puncture of the cornea with the needle. If multiple attempts tostimulate epithelial adhesion have failed, the lasttreatment option is a keratectomy. Su-percial keratectomy stroma, epitheliumbasement membrane, epithelium, and Medical treatment after a corneal debridement, keratotomy, or keratectomy is used to prevent infec-tion, speed healing, and relieve discomfort.

Antifungal treatment is also strongly rec-ommended in any corneal ulcer to diminish the riskof fungal invasion. Topical atropine is a topicalcycloplegic that will decrease ciliary spasm and paininduced by secondary uveitis from the corneal ulcer.Systemic NSAIDs are recommended to decrease in-flammation and improve comfort, but the lowestdose that keeps the horse reasonably comfortable isrecommended. A corneal contact lens can help im-prove corneal discomfort by stopping the mechanicalabrasion of the eyelids over the wound. 9 Corneal Mineralization EtiologyCorneal mineralization is a degenerative disease re-sulting in spontaneous dystrophic calcication.Calcium deposits will occur in the anterior stroma orepithelium. This condition is observed in patientswith recurrent anterior uveitis and most often asso-ciated with topical steroid use. Corneal mineral-ization deposits are also observed in chronic andrecurrent keratitis.DiagnosisThe clinical appearance is that of multifocal white,crystalline, or semi-refractile opacities that are oftenfound in a horizontal pattern across the central orventral cornea. 1The dorsal cornea is rarely af - fected. Under magnication the surface of the min-eral may look rough or some foci may be sittingabove the epithelial surface. Examination of theanterior segment will often reveal signs of recurrentuveitis such as iris hyperpigmentation, corporanigra atrophy, and posterior synechiae (Fig. 2). Corneal mineralization can result in a nonhealing corneal ulceration. The mineral deposits can frac-ture resulting in single or multiple areas of linear orpunctate stain uptake. Fluorescein stain cansometimes adhere to the roughened surface of themineral. Prior to fluorescein application these ar-eas can autofluoresce under cobalt blue light. Occasionally, the cornea responds to this mineral- ization by sloughing the deposit creating a largercorneal ulcer. often heal withoutmuch difculty but the resultant signicant stromalloss may heal with a corneal facet. A corneal facetis an area of stromal loss that has healed with acovering of epithelium but has not lled in the stro-mal defect. Anterior and midstromal facets are oflittle concern but deep stromal facets are at greatrisk to rupture.TreatmentPatients that are nonpainful can be treated with atopical calcium chelator like ethylenediaminetet-raacetic acid (EDTA) 1-3% q 12 h. EDTA can becompounded as an ointment or made up as a solu-tion in the eld by taking a purple-top vacutainertube and lling it halfway with sterile wa-ter. 4Higher concentrations of EDTA may induce discomfort in some horses. This treatment is mosteffective in reducing new mineral deposit formation. Patients that are painful and ulcerated can be treated conservatively with topical antibiotic, anti-fungal, and pain management. If the ulcer has nothealed after 2-3 weeks of therapy, then debridementof the mineral is recommended as the mineral de-posits can create a barrier for epithelium adhesionand migration. A cotton-tip applicator debride-ment is not effective for removal of the mineral, sothe handle end of a sterile scalpel blade can be usedto aggressively chip off the mineral. The most ef-fective way to remove supercial mineral is debride-ment with a diamond-tip burr. If the mineral isdeeper than the surface of the stroma, debridementmay not be effective. Sometimes the epitheliumwill heal over the stromal mineral but these patientsare still prone to recurrent ulcerations. Referralfor surgery to remove the anterior stroma via asupercial keratectomy is recommended in thesecases. All patients with corneal mineralization should discontinue topical steroids. Topical NSAIDsshould be used to help control the anterior uveitisand keratitis conditions. The use of daily topicalEDTA 1-3% q 12 h is recommended for patientsthat develop new mineral deposits. Eosinophilic Keratitis EtiologyThe underlying eosinophilic keratitis(EK) or keratoconjunctivitis is unknown, but isthought to be a reaction to an allergic or parasiticstimulus. This reaction results in mast-cell de-granulation that brings eosinophils to the corneaand the eosinophilic granule proteins induce severeinflammation and inhibit wound healing. 13,14This Fig. 2. Corneal mineralization with signs of is recognized worldwide with regional andseasonal variations. The condition may be seen inone or multiple horses on the same farm. 15 DiagnosisEK initially with blepharoedema, chemo-sis, ocular discomfort ofone or both eyes. In some horses the eyelids are soswollen that examination of the cornea is limited.Corneal lesions may be present behind the thirdeyelid but may be difcult to visualize (Fig. 3).Corneal lesions always start at the limbus with theventral medial and lateral locations most commonlyaffected. Multiple lesions in the same eye can occurand extension into the axial cornea is often observedwith larger lesions (Fig. 4). The corneal lesions aresupercial ulcerations with a dull gray plaque orwhite to pink caseous plaque appearance. Theseulcers often have faint fluorescein stain uptake thatcan be missed without a cobalt blue light. Cornealvascularization is variable but most often intenseand rapidly progressive. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, ulceration appearance, and is conrmed by cornealcytology, which will demonstrate an inflammatoryresponse with numerous eosinophils interspersedamong corneal epithelial cells and inltrating neu-trophils. 15,16Bright pink refractile granules may also be observed on the slide. Late in the diseasewhen there is a chronic supercial ulceration, eosin-ophils may no longer be observed on cytology. Inthe chronic stages of the ulceration the patient isoften very comfortable, requiring little to no painmanagement. Horses that present with a smallcorneal EK show discomfort. Ker-atoconjunctivitis can also occur with 15,17 Increased ocular discomfort in a patient with EKoften suggests a secondary bacterial or fungal in-fection (Fig. 5). The hallmarks of this condition that should raise suspicion are blepharoedema with caseous dis-charge and limbal-based corneal ulcerations associ-ated with plaques. Ocular discomfort is variablebut frequently minimal. Bilateral disease and mul-tiple lesions per eye are strongly suggestive of EK.EK ulcer healing is prolonged, often taking monthsfor resolution. Recurrence of the condition in sub-sequent years has been observed in up to one third ofpatients. 15 Fig. 3. EK with an ulcer on the medial limbus. Fig. 4.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 171HOW TO SESSION: OPHTHALMOLOGYTreatmentTreatment is aimed at reducing the inflam-mation and eosinophilic reaction that is delayingwound healing, preventing corneal infection, anddecreasing recurrence. Medical treatment withbroad-spectrum topical antibiotics and antifungalsis strongly recommended to prevent corneal infec-tion during the prolonged healing time. The in-flammatory response is best treated systemically astopical steroids and NSAIDs increase the risk ofcorneal infection. However, some clinicians willuse a short course of topical steroids or a topical NSAID on conrmed EK cases even though cornealulceration is present. If such treatment is chosen,the horse should be monitored closely for infection.To limit the use of topical steroids a short taperingcourse of systemic steroids is recommended, 15often starting with 20 mg dexamethasone q 24 h, taperingevery 3 days. Not all horses are candidates forsystemic steroid use due to the greater risk of lami-nitis in patients with metabolic or Cushing's dis-ease; therefore, the clinician must weigh the risksfor each patient. Patients that are not candidatesfor systemic steroids can be treated with oral anti-histamines such as cetirizine 0.4 mg/kg q 12 h. Medical treatment for nonhealing corneal ulcer- ation associated with EK can take months topicalmedications but corneal debridement can help speedhealing. Cotton-tip debridement does not provideenough friction to disrupt the epithelial basementmembrane and promote healing. Instead, the han-dle end of a sterile scalpel blade is recommended toscrape plaques and loose epithelial cells off the ex-isting ulcer beds. Diamond-tipped burr debride-ment may hasten healing by removing the abnormalbasement membrane and residual eosinophilic gran-ule proteins 14and may promote re-epithelialization of EK ulcers in just 2-3 weeks. If these debride-ment techniques do not result in healing and there isa static painful corneal ulceration, then a supercialkeratectomy is recommended to remove the abnor-mal stroma and epithelium. Supercial keratec-tomy is commonly followed by resolution of chronicEK corneal lesions within 2-3 weeks. Pain management for the EK ulcer is variable. Most horses need very little systemic NSAIDs andtopical atropine to maintain comfort. Horses thatneed signicant pain management are likely to havea secondary infection and referral for supercial ker-atectomy is recommended. Cetirizine and constantfly mask protection are recommended during thebuggy season to reduce recurrence of EK. Oral ce-tirizine dosing at 0.4 mg/kg q 12 h has been shown tosignicantly decrease repeat episodes. 15 Corneal Edema EtiologyCorneal edema is the accumulation of fluid in thecorneal stroma. Clinically corneal edema presentas a focal or diffuse pattern of corneal haziness andwill have varying degrees of severity. Normally,fluid is blocked from accumulating in the stroma byan intact epithelium and endothelium.Corneal ulcerations cause stromal edema as epithe-lial loss allows fluid to penetrate the corneal stromademarcating the area of corneal ulceration. Cor-neal endothelial disease will result in corneal edemaas well, and can cause focal corneal ulceration. The corneal endothelium has two main functions: to decrease stromal aqueous humor penetration andto pump fluid out of the corneal stroma. 1The tight junctions between endothelial cells decrease thepenetration of aqueous but do not block osmotictransfer of macromolecules, andnutrients in to the stroma. 1Each endothelial cell has an active ion-water transfer pump dependent onNa/H11001/K/H11001-ATPase to help keep the stroma relatively dehydrated. 1,5 Corneal edema can be the result of focal or diffuse endothelial dysfunction and can lead to cornealulceration. Focal endothelial dysfunction occurswhen there is segmental disruption of the endothe-lial basement membrane or a linear break in De-scemet's membrane. This edema will often resolveas the endothelial fracture leaving a linearcorneal striae as a footprint. endothelial dysfunction can also occur when keratic precipitatesor brin accumulate in a specic region, or regional endotheliitis (Fig. 6).Diffuse corneal edema can be due to diffuse endo-theliitis, uveitis, or glaucoma (Fig. 7). All of these diseases can lead to focal or diffuse corneal edema that can result in supercial ulcer-ations due to corneal bullae (Fig. 8). Bullae are afocal corneal epithelial response to moderate-to-severe corneal stromal edema and manifest as smallepithelial blisters that fluid. Bullae thatrupture create punctate ulcerations on the cornealsurface (Fig. 9). Clusters of these punctate defects Fig. 6. Endotheliitis with multiple leading to a larger region of cornealulceration.DiagnosisA prominent clinical sign that suggests that endo-thelial dysfunction and stromal edema is the causeof an ulceration is a larger area of edema than ex-pected for the size of the ulcer. mayinclude focal or diffuse keratic cells that adhereto the endothelial surface), corneal striae (a pair ofparallel lines approximately 1 mm apart along theendothelium crossing the cornea), or signs of ante-rior uveitis or glaucoma. Bullae or epithelial blis-ters are best seen under magnication but can alsobe illuminated with fluorescein stain, which willdemonstrate punctate patches of uptake where bul-lae have ruptured (Fig. 9). In some patients, clus-ters of bullae coalesce as supercial abrasions with adistinct geographic shape (Figs. 8 and 9). Theseulcers can be difcult to heal as persistent edemaresults in new blister formation and because theanterior stroma is not healthy enough for appropri-ate epithelial adhesion.TreatmentThe treatment for the corneal ulcerations due toendothelial dysfunction and stromal edema is to re-duce fluid accumulation and support endothelialfunction. Once the corneal edema has improvedthe corneal ulcer should heal quickly, but an indo-lent ulcer can form due to poor epithelial adhesion.Patients with anterior uveitis will have improvedendothelial function with reduction of uveitis andbrin. Topical NSAIDs and atropine will help con-trol ocular inflammation in these patients, but theuse of topical steroids in these patients can lead toinfected corneal ulcers, so systemic steroids are rec-ommended. In patients with glaucoma, a reductionin the intraocular pressure will improve corneal edema by decreasing the hydrostatic pressure on theendothelium. Glaucoma complicated by corneal ul-ceration with (diclofenac, ciliary epithelium is recommended for bettercontrol of the intraocular pressure. Patients with temporary edema due to trauma or corneal striae formation can be treated with sys-temic anti-inflammatories and topical NSAIDs.Patients with chronic edema from indolent or recur-rent ulcers due to endothelial dysfunction will ben-et from debridement or surgery. Debridement is Fig. 7. Glaucoma with diffuse edema and multiple large bullae,intraocular pressure (IOP) 62 mm Hg. Fig. 8. Moderate endotheliitis with multiple small bullae andsupercial ulcer. Fig. 9.

The goal of surgery is to decrease current edema and new edema, and increase corneal bro-sis and neovascularization. Referral to a special-ist for thermokeratoplasty, or supercialkeratectomy with or without a conjunctival inlaygraft is recommended for cases that persist afterdebridement. All ulcers that accompany corneal edema need broad-spectrum topical antibiotics and antifungalsto prevent a corneal infection. Topical 5% hyper-tonic saline ointment, such as Muro-128, can be usedto create an osmotic gradient across the epitheliumand draw fluid out of the stroma. 1This concen - trated salt ointment can sting an open cornealwound and should be given separate from other top-ical medications that are intended for epithelialpenetration. Corneal Infection EtiologyEquine corneal ulcerations are prone to infectiondue to environmental contaminants, human fo-mites, and changes in ocular surface flora. Envi-ronmental contaminants can be introduced at the time of injury when a foreign body pierces thecorneal surface or the open wound is exposed todust and dirt. Veterinarians can play a role ininfecting the cornea by applying medications with-out gloves and/or not properly preparing the peri-ocular area before diagnostic and treatmentprocedures. Ocular surface flora can vary de-pending on the age of the horse, time of year,housing conditions, and geographic area. Theuse of topical antibiotics can disrupt the balance ofthe ocular microflora allowing pathogenic or non-pathogenic bacterial overgrowth. 1,18-20 In the horse the most serious corneal infections are due to Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, or Pseu-domonas bacterial species and Aspergillus or Fusar-ium fungal species. 1,21-25The clinical appearance of the ulceration does not identify the specic patho-gen, but certain clinical ndings may be correlatedwith the etiology.DiagnosisClinical suspicion of an infection is based on thepresence of ocular pain, inltrate, stromal loss, vas-cular pattern, and of uveitis. Bacterial can present with stromal inltrate (Fig. 10) orno inltrate. Infected ulcers often have an intensedeep or supercial vascular pattern (Fig. 10). Bac-terial infections can lead to keratomalacia with ge-latinous stroma hanging from the corneal surface.Keratomalacia can occur quickly and within a fewhours a supercial ulcer can become a corneal melt-ing ulcer.Fungal ulcers present with varying clinical signs and are often more painful than expected for the sizeof the corneal lesion. Fungal ulcers are often slowto vascularize. They can present with no inltrateor demonstrate a prominant stromal inltrate.Often fungal ulcers have a supercial raised plaquethat can be yellow, white, or brown in color. Theplaque may be bordered by a deep groove of stromalloss that resembles a moat around a castle (Fig. 11).The defect is the result of the local process that istrying to slough the plaque, but the deep groove canquickly progress to corneal perforation. Fungal ul-cers will often get more painful soon after topicalantifungal therapy is initiated as the fungal die offcauses more inflammation. These ulcers can have Fig. 10.

Cytology is essential to conrm the type of micro- bial infection and to help guide topical treatment.Culture and sensitivity is recommended to identifythe microbe and adjust topical treatment if thecornea is not improving. The New Bolton CenterMicrobiology Laboratory has a topical ocular sensi-tivity panel that tests pathogen sensitivity to vari-ous commercially available and compoundedantibiotics, using a Kirby-Bauer technique.TreatmentRapid institution of aggressive topical treatment ofcorneal infections with appropriate antimicrobialsmay circumvent the need for surgical intervention.Selection of antimicrobial(s) should be based on re-sults of cytology and culture. All patients requirebroad-spectrum antibiotic coverage but cytology willdirect how much Gram-positive or Gram-negativecoverage is necessary. All patients should receiveantifungal coverage but cytology will determine thetype of antifungal and frequency. mydriasis. As tear-lm protease activity isusually very high in infected ulcers, aggressive an-tiprotease activity should always be instituted.See Table 2 for commonly used topical treatmentsfor corneal infections with notations on agent spec-trum of activity, format, dosing, and adverse effects. Keratomalacia and Stromal Loss EtiologyThe maintenance of corneal health and wound heal-ing depends on balance of proteolytic enzymes andtheir inhibitors. Corneal melting or keratomalacia occurs when excessive proteolytic enzymes are presentin the precorneal lm, or released inltrative or and that are found at increased levels inequine tears after acute corneal ulceration. Theseproteinases decrease as the wound heals. 1,3Corneal bacterial infections with Streptococcus and Pseudomo- nasspecies trigger the most dramatic melting due to very high levels of tear lm and stromal proteases26-27 and are frequently associated with rapid liquefactionand/or perforation.DiagnosisThe diagnosis of keratomalacia is made upon corneal stroma, stromal orprotruding with stain uptakeand gelatinous cornea is demonstrated by using themotion of the eyelid to move the soft or protrudingcornea. Stromal loss can be observed as a divot ordepression in the corneal surface (Fig. 14). Theamount of stromal loss can be estimated using the Fig. 12. Sloughing central corneal fungal lesion with distinctgroove and poor vascular response. Table 2.

As the beam crosses over the defect, the lossof beam thickness compared with the normal sur-rounding cornea can be estimated. It is difcult toestimate the degree of stromal thickness loss underan area of corneal melting.TreatmentCorneal cytology and culture should be obtained forall corneal ulcers that have stromal loss or softenedcornea. It should be assumed that corneal infectionis present; same-day cytology analysis will guideprompt and rational antimicrobial choices that maybe sight saving. See Table 2 for commonly usedtopical treatments for stromal loss and keratomala-cia. In addition to topical antimicrobials, the use oftopical anticollagenases is critical to slow cornealliquefaction. MMPs are inhibited EDTA,acetylcysteine, processes that influence enzy-matic stability and function. 26-28 Antiproteases need to be applied topically every 1-2 hours in patients that have keratomalacia oractive stromal loss that are being treated medically.Medical treatment should be started immediatelyand daily monitoring is recommended until the cor-nea is rming up. If the stromal loss is increasingor the melting is continuing to get worse, referral fora conjunctival graft is recommended. Conjunctivalgrafts act as a patch over the wound and allowserum, broblasts, and vessels to have rapid anddirect action on wound healing. Conjunctivalgrafts are often stable within 2-3 weeks, allowingtopical medical therapy to be minimized and discon-tinuation of pain management therapy. Conjuncti-val grafts do induce signicant corneal brosislimiting vision in the area of conjunctival adhesion.Large corneal melts that cover the entire centralarea of the cornea and threaten vision can be man-aged surgically with amnion grafts (Fig. 15). Am-nion grafts do not bring a direct vascular supply tothe wound but act as a disposable dressing thatproteases and microbes will attack, decreasingdeleterious effects on the cornea. 1,29,30Corneal wounds treated with amnion will still result in scartissue but the density and vascularity of the scar isminimized allowing for much greater vision than aconjunctival graft.

This threatensvision; an /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO SESSION: OPHTHALMOLOGYApplication of Medications Topical medications should be applied with concur-rent positive reinforcement (oral treats) given beforeand after every application. Consistent applicationtechnique will increase the probability that medica-tions will successfully enter the tear lm to treat theocular surface. A small amount of ointment on thepad of a gloved index nger applied into the medialcanthal pocket is a reliable technique in cooperativepatients. Ointments can also be applied using a1-mL syringe loaded with ointment that is then ap-plied to the medial canthal pocket. All horses thatare difcult, very painful, or dangerous to treatshould have a subpalpebral lavage placed even if theulcer is a simple ulcer. Horses with stromal loss orkeratomalacia must have a subpalpebral lavageplaced to avoid placing pressure on the globe andaccommodate frequent treatments by multiple peo-ple. Subpalpebral lavage systems can be main-tained by most clients at home and can be repairedif needed. For horses that require turnout, the tub-ing system can be protected from breaking by ttingthe horse with a \"slinky\" neck cover (item of equineapparel often used to protect the coats of showhorses) and a fly mask. In the warmer weatherwhen a slinky would create excess sweating, a largergauge tubing can be slid over the smaller lavagetubing when the system is placed to protect thelength of tubing that extends from the middle of theforehead to the injection port at the withers. Application frequency varies depending on the condition being treated. Infected ulcers need fre-quent topical medication application to reduce thefungal or bacterial burden. Noninfected ulcersneed less frequent treatments given that the goal isto prevent infection. Treatment with bacteriostaticdrugs should be frequent as these drugs onlydecrease microbial replication. When multiple top-ical ophthalmic solutions or suspensions are sched-uled for one treatment session, they should beapplied at 5-minute intervals to give each medica-tion time to be absorbed before the tear volumeturns over at 7 minutes. 31Small amounts of oph - thalmic ointments can be applied simultaneously,but if the total volume of applied ointment is largesome of the medication may not make it to the cor-neal surface. Splitting the volume of ointment de-livery into two applications is recommended whenfour to ve medications are prescribed. Assess-ment of mydriasis following topical atropine appli-cation can be used as a test to determine whetherthe client can get medications onto the eye success-fully. If the pupil is dilated after the owner appliesatropine, then most likely the client can get medica-tions onto the eye. 2. Discussion Equine corneal ulcerations can be one on the mostfrustrating conditions a veterinarian will treat.Simple ulcers that heal in a few days with minimaltreatment are very rewarding, but complicated ul-cers that do not heal, are infected, and/or meltingchallenge all clinicians including veterinary oph-thalmologists. The best approach for choosing ap-propriate treatment is to perform a throughophthalmic examination of both eyes looking for anunderlying etiology of the ulceration. Clinical fea-tures that should be assessed include the pattern ofcorneal edema and neovascularization associatedwith the ulcer, whether stromal inltrate, mineraliza-tion, or eosinophilic plaques are present. The ex-amination should detail the number of ulcerationsand their location on the cornea, and whether theaffected globe shows signs of past or present equinerecurrent uveitis. Fluorescein staining must for nonadherent epithelium. Corneal cytol-ogy is essential to quickly determine whether thewound is infected or has eosinophils and help guidetherapy choices. Submission of a corneal samplefor culture and sensitivity will guide topical therapychoices in a poorly responding wound; negative cul-ture results will assure clinicians that debridementof an indolent lesion is a safe therapeutic choice.Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be in-stituted with drug choices based on formulation,application technique, dosing frequency, availabil-ity, and cost. Anticollagenase and mydriatic ther-apy is essential in most cases. Clinicians shouldseek consultation with or referral to a veterinaryophthalmologist when corneal ulcers are not re-sponding to therapy, when secondary uveitis ispoorly responsive, or in ulcers that demonstrate sig-nicant stromal loss or keratomalacia.

Dr. Bill Rebhun in 1982 was the rst to clinicallydescribe the corneal SA of the horse as a painfulsight-threatening condition. 1-4The diagnosis of a supercial SA, deep (DSA), orfull-thickness SA can difcult insome eyes with severe iridocyclitis and cornealedema, and is best made by clinical appearance,history, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Medicaland surgical treatments have developed andevolved over many years for treatment of super-cial and deep corneal SA. 1-4 2. DiscussionPresumed Pathogenesis of Equine Corneal SAs A number of different hypotheses for the pathogen-esis of SA in horses have been proposed. 1-4A likely theory for eyes with SA is that a pathogen orforeign body may be trapped in the stroma duringthe healing process of an infected corneal ulcer, oroccur by direct inoculation of the stroma by a mi-cropuncture through the intact epithelium. It isalso possible that some SA could develop in thedeeper layer of the corneal stroma via vertical mi-gration of fungi from the supercial cornea to thedeeper stroma, and possibly by hematogenousspread of embolic abscess material leaving the iriscapillaries to reach the anterior chamber and attachto the corneal endothelium. In this latter proposal,systemic infection could be the cause of DSAs.This latter theory may also explain why a SA in oneeye can precede the development of a SA in the othereye, and also why horse farms that have historicallynever had any horses with SA suddenly experiencemultiple SA cases. Thirty years ago most equine SAs were believed to be caused by bacterial infections. 4We now know that the most common cause of SA in horses isfungal infection. 1-3Some fungi seem to have an unexplained afnity for the deeper layers of thecornea with fungal organisms often present in ornear Descemet's membrane in equine DSA. It maybe that these fungi produce high amounts of protein-ases that enable them to penetrate deeper into thecornea to cause DSA. The most common fungi isolated from SA from horses are Aspergillus ,Fusarium ,Candida , and Al- and Differential Diagnoses for SAs in the Horse The differential diagnosis for a horse with a nonul-cerative focal yellow/white corneal opacity vesicles. Stromal abscesses are always painful with the lack of comfort ranging from subtle eyelid droopingto severe squinting. They are generally single butmultiple SA can occur. The eye with an early SAwill have mild iridocyclitis with miosis and/or a pu-pil that responds poorly to atropine therapy. Se-vere anterior uveitis with flare and hypopyon canoccur in chronic SA eyes. Corneal edema can sur-round the SA lesion in early cases or become gener-alized with time. Vascularization of the corneamay be absent or intense. Asymmetrical cornealvascularization is a hallmark of the SA. Fluores-cein retention is not prominent in most eyes withSA. 1-3 The diagnosis of a SA is based on the visualization of a focal, yellow-white, corneal stromal inltratewith associated corneal edema. 1-3Single or multi -ple abscesses may be present. Fluorescein dye re-tention is either negative or faintly positive over theSA. A mild-to-fulminating iridocyclitis can occur tocause ocular pain and possible blindness. Cornealvascularization varies according to the stage of SAprogression, the presence of fungi, and the length oftime the abscess has been present. Vascularizationmay obscure a good view of an abscess. Immune Response of the Normal Cornea and the Corneawith a SA The function of the cornea is to be a transparent,supportive barrier. The transparency is main-tained by corneal immune privilege. The corneadoes not normally react to immunogenic stimuli in atraditional manner to avoid loss of transparencyfrom the development of edema, neovascularization,cellular inltration, neutrophils andmacrophages in the horse) are attracted very ag-gressively and rapidly for the formation of a SA,suggesting that the immune privilege of the corneahas been lost. An angiogenic and lymphangiogenicresponse is eventually appreciated in many cases. The formation of a SA may be divided into three functionally different steps: peracute, acute, andchronic phases. 5,6During the peracute phase cel - lular inltration can be seen in the cornea with orwithout ulceration. Vascularization can be seen Fig. 1. A circular DSA (yellow) is surrounded by corneal edema(blue). Limbal vascularization (red) is intense in this eye buthas not invaded the DSA. Fig. 2. A DSA with sparse vascularization in the cornea anteriorto the abscess partially obscures a good view of the lesion. Fig. 3. A full-thickness SA with a brighter supercial compo-nent and surrounding darker gray deeper abscess is present. Fig. 4. Large-diameter SA involving the entire corneal thick- ness is present with edema and prominent /H11408Vol. from the limbus. This inflammatory re-sponse in the cornea will normally also create mild-to-severe anterior segment inflammation or uveitisthat manifests as flare, hypopyon, and occasionallyhyphema, and a miotic pupil. During the acutephase of SA formation, vascularization is observedin areas of the stroma where cellular inltration ispresent. The vascular response in the areas dis-tant from the abscess will be less pronounced, re-sulting in an asymmetrical vascular pattern. Thediffuse cellular inltration will be consolidated to asmaller, but more dense focal area, and in manycases the cellular inltrate will migrate to thedeeper stroma and Descemet's membrane. Theconcurrent uveitis will at this point be severe ifmedical treatment has not been initiated. Thechronic phase is characterised by vascularization ofthe supercial cornea anterior to the SA. For rea-sons as yet unknown new blood vessels will noteasily invade an abscess that is located deep in theposterior cornea. It is possible that cytokines orother chemical agents from fungi, bacteria,or leukocytes factors thatinhibit vascularization of these deep SAs. 5,6 The Healing Process of a SA Vascularization of the abscess and remodelling ofthe corneal stroma is necessary for healing ofSAs. 1-3The purulent material, which in other equine tissues is liqueed, remains rm in mostequine corneal SAs and therefore is impossible todrain. If the SA does heal, it does so because bloodvessels invade the abscess to induce resolution of theleukocyte response. The vascular response is ini-tially quite robust, but over several weeks begins toattenuate, and results in eventual mild-to-severesubepithelial brosis of the stromal lesion. SAs inthe anterior stroma are more likely to respond tomedical therapy, whereas abscesses of the posteriordeep stroma (DSA) and abscesses involving the en-tire corneal thickness may not respond to medicaltherapy and thus require surgical removal of theabscess. 1 The pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, in- cluding cytokines, involved in formation, mainte-nance, equine SA are currently beinginvestigated. Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) has been shown to have an important role inthe cornea vascularization response in other animalspecies and could also have an important role in thevascularization process in the horse cornea. Pig-ment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) acts in bal-ance with VEGF and is an anti-angiogenesiscytokine that is normally present in the equine ret-ina and in the cornea of other animal species. Thepresence of PEDF will inhibit vascularization. It isthought that PEDF has a very important rolein maintaining the immune privilege of the eye.PEDF may be involved in the absence of vascular-ization of the surrounding tissue of a SA in thehorse. It is possible that a loss of homeostatic bal-ance between VEGF and PEDF may play a role inthe absence of vascularization seen in many cases offungal SAs. 5,6 Recent Evidence Concerning Horses in Florida with SAs The University of Florida found that equine cornealSAs do not often appear in Florida when the weatheris severely hot and humid. Instead, SAs tend todevelop when the weather is within more \"normal\"temperature and humidity parameters similar tothose in more temperate climates of the world.High periods of increased wind speed also foundmore horses diagnosed with SA. 7 Data from Florida horses with SA suggest that fungal organisms are not often found on microbio-logic culture of SA samples even though a largenumber of these cases are suspected to be fungal inorigin. 1-3,5,6Histologic evaluation of a DSA tissue is needed to determine the true etiology. Microbi-ologic cultures for bacteria and fungi are still recom-mended, as well as histopathologic evaluation, tond an etiology and institute proper therapy forequine DSA cases. Polymerase chain reaction hasbeen suggested as a method for recognizing theagent in a cytology sample or surgical biopsy. Con-focal microscopy has been shown to be useful as adiagnostic tool for mycotic keratitis, and in the fu-ture, these methods may prove useful in providing amore accurate diagnosis of the etiology of DSA in thehorse. Fungal hyphae were found in 47.1% of the DSA cases in Florida horses where the abscess was re-moved surgically and submitted for histopathology.Most fungal the 5,6All three expressed in DSA tissue. Fun-gal DSA cases from Florida had little to no stromalvascularization suggesting the fungi induce a de-creased vascular response to a DSA. A lack ofVEGF-A expression in the tissue of these cases withfungal hyphae present in the biopsies suggest anabnormally decreased VEGF-A expression to be thelikely reason for the slow vascularization thatcauses often prolonged resolution of fungal DSA. Fig. 5. The eye in Figure 4 healed after 5 weeks of aggressivemedical therapy. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 181HOW TO is hypothesized that the antifungal drugs used preoperatively are effective at killing the fungi butthe corneal reaction to the fungal death is actuallycausing the abscess formation. This analysis of bi-opsies from Florida horses with SA and DSA foundthat DSA with fungi as the etiology had a negativeassociation with stromal vascularization. A nega-tive association between positive expression ofVEGF-A and PEDF, and the presence of fungal hy-phae was also found. When fungi were identied inDSA cases as the sole etiology, a suppurative kera-titis was found in 75% of the cases. A negativeassociation was found between bacterial growth andsuppurative keratitis. 5,6 The clinical appearance of DSA with fungi as the etiology was shown to be a focal yellow or whitecorneal stromal opacity. Suppurative keratitis(predominantly neutrophils) most likely histopathologic diagnosisfor fungal SAs, and more importantly, fungi with stromal vascular-ization of DSA. 5,6The macrophages in the pyo - granulomatous form of DSA of horses were moreeffective at removing hyphae and thus rarely hadfungal involvement. 5,6 The study of biopsies from Florida horses with SA and DSA found the corneal SA cases with no fungalhyphae present had a signicant vascular responsewith VEGF-A present, present lackedcorneal vascularization and VEGF-A. It could behypothesized that the true cause for the decreasedvascular response of corneal SAes is an abnormaldecrease in VEGF-A expression instead of an abnor-mal increase in antiangiogenic secretion. 5,6 Medical Treatment of SAs Medical treatment consists of a combinationof antimicrobial medications, mydriatic/cycloplegicdrugs, and anti-inflammatory medications. Sub-palpebral lavage aid aggressive medi-cal therapy. The antimicrobial medication willnormally be a combination of antibiotic and antifun-gal drugs. These topical medications may need tobe administrated to the cornea between four and sixtimes daily for 4-6 weeks. 1 Medical treatment of supercial SA is most eco- nomical and can result in good visual outcomes withmild scarring (Figs. 4 and 5). DSA are, however,often unresponsive to medical therapy. Medicaltreatment of DSA is the rst step to address theuveitis but surgical therapy may be necessary forDSA to most quickly resolve the condition. Signs ofearly positive healing of a SA would be vasculariza-tion of the abscess, although what occurs in someDSAs is vascularization of the stroma anterior to theDSA but not the DSA itself. The DSA in the latteris thus persisting and not healing. 1 The whitish yellow cellular inltrate of the super- cial or DSA will be replaced with beige-to-graybrotic tissue during positive SA healing, and uve-itis will diminish and be more easily controlled al-lowing reduced doses of systemically administeredanti-inflammatory medications. Most horses withsupercial SA require only low doses of systemicnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) tocontrol uveitis. However, despite this low-dose NSAIDtherapy the DSA is still active and the therapyshould be increased. A uveitic flare means thateither the infectious agent causing the SA has notbeen eliminated, or that leukocyte-derived cytokinesare still present in the cornea, and further medicaltreatment or even surgical treatment is indicated.During medical therapy, if no signs of recovery canbe appreciated, or if the anterior segment inflamma-tion persists despite aggressive medical treatment,surgical options should be considered. 1 Voriconazole is presently recommended as the drug of choice for therapy of SA8and can be ordered as an US Food and Drug Administration-approved,lyophilized bottle and reconstituted with sterile wa-ter to make a 1% solution. Voriconazole has beenused successfully intrastromally and intracamerallyin the therapy of 9,10Voriconazole should be administered carefully in 0.20-mL quantitiesfrom syringes. It does not seem to be compatiblewith silicone infusion pumps. Voriconazole doesseem stable when stored in glass vials but is notstable in silicone or plastic reservoirs. Voricona-zole does seem stable at temperatures between 23and 40\u00b0C for up to 30 days. 9a A mydriatic/cycloplegic drug such as atropine 1% ophthalmic solution will need to be administratedtopically between one and four times daily to achievepupil dilation and cycloplegia. Atropine should beused with caution given that horses treated withatropine have decreased motility of the intestine.This risk should not prohibit the use of atropine forhorses given that a mydriatic is essential to treat theoften-severe secondary inflammation in the anteriorsegment. 1 Systemic NSAIDs are also critical in the medical treatment of SA. Flunixin meglumine is the drugof choice for eye diseases in horses. The specicmechanism of the inflammatory response in the an-terior segment of the horse is not well described andto date it is not known whether uveitis in the horseis initiated by a Cox-1 or Cox-2 pathway. It isrecommended to treat SA horses with an initial doseof 1.1 mg/kg flunixin meglumine every 12 hours IVor PO until the inflammation in the anterior seg-ment decreases. When the horse is comfortableand signs of inflammation are decreased in the an-terior segment, the NSAID drug dose may be de-creased. It is not recommended to continue a highdose of anti-inflammatory medication for extendedperiods of time because the anti-inflammatory ef-fects of flunixin meglumine also induce an anti-angiogenic effect on the vascularization of the SA. 1 It is usually necessary to continue NSAID therapythrough the length of the treatment period for the 182 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO SESSION: OPHTHALMOLOGYSA. In many cases, this drug will be the last med-ication to be discontinued. Omeprazole may be ad-ministrated to decrease the possibility of gastriculceration caused by the long-time use of a systemicNSAID medication. Surgical Treatment for SAs During the 1980s, surgical treatment of equine SAwas more or less condemned because of poor out-come and medical treatment alone was recom-mended. These recommendations have sincechanged, medical treatment may need to be contin-ued for months in the DSA. In some cases, anteriorsegment inflammation cannot be controlled. Ifthere is not a dramatic resolution to the DSA anduveitis after a week of medical therapy it is recom-mended that surgical alternatives be considered.Various surgical options for surgical removal of SAare available depending on the depth of the abscessin the stroma and the topographic location of the SAin the cornea. Supercial keratectomy may aid penetration of drugs to graft, used for eyes with SA. 2,3 PK1-3is full-thickness microsurgical removal of the region of the cornea containing the SA followed byfull-thickness transplantation of the corneal epithe-lium, stroma, and Descemet's membrane/endothelium(Figs. 6-9) Full-thickness penetrating keratoplastymay be performed in horses for therapeutic and tec-tonic reasons for melting ulcers with extensive stromalloss, iris prolapse/descemetoceles, and full-thicknessSAs. Penetrating keratoplasty has become a viable,routine, and successful surgical technique in horseswith severe keratitis, and is associated with a verygood visual outcome in most cases (approximately80%). However, nearly all the corneal transplant-donor allografts in horses vascularize postoperativelyand exhibit troubling degrees of corneal opacicationat the surgical site. The concept of lamellar keratoplasty is to target and replace only diseased corneal tissue while re-taining the normal healthy corneal tissue. 1-3La- mellar keratoplasty is used for tectonic reasons toreplace damaged stroma in melting corneal ulcers ofhuman patients as it provides enhanced donor-graftsurvival and improved visual outcomes compared Fig. 6.

Theremaining healthy corneal layers are preserved inDLEK and PLK. This targeted replacement of in-dividual diseased components of the cornea alsoseems suitable for treatment of equine keratopa-thies. The overall success rates for rapid return tovisual function for surgical therapy of DSA by DLEKand PLK in horses are higher than for PK. 1-3 PLK (Figs. 10-13) in horses is recommended for DSA in the axial cornea that are 10 mm or less indiameter. 1-3The overlying epithelium may be edematous but is intact, and the anterior stromamay be vascularized but should not have cellularinltrate. This procedure replaces the diseasedposterior stroma and endothelium, and has provensuccessful for surgical therapy of DSA in the horse.DLEK (Figs. 14 and 15) is a similar technique that isrecommended for medically nonresponsive DSAs inthe peripheral cornea that are 10 mm or less indiameter, and have moderate vascularization andedema of the inltrate. TheDLEK Descemet's membrane andendothelium while preserving the corneal surfaceand topography. The difference between the PLKand the DLEK is the placement of sutures in theanterior cornea in the PLK surgery compared withonly sutures in the limbus when the DLEK surgeryis performed. 1-3 Visual Outcome for Medical and SurgicalTreatment of SAs The visual outcome for SA depends on whether thehealing process has been completed with medicaltreatment or with one of the surgical approaches. 1-3 Less scarring of the cornea can be seen with smallDSA treated medically if they respond to medicaltreatment alone. If this is not possible the PK,PLK, or DLEK is recommended depending on thelocation and depth of the SA. These surgical tech-niques will all leave some type of corneal scar, giventhat a full- or partial-thickness corneal allograft isused to close the corneal defect. It has not beenpossible to date to inhibit the rejection of the cornealtransplant so all grafts become opaque as part of therejection process. The rejection of the equine cor-neal graft will be seen as a brotic area with vascu-larization. The graft is used for tectonic ratherthan optical reasons. The horse will retain visionin the areas outside the graft opacity as long as Fig. 10. A DSA and edema are present in peripheral cornea inthis horse. Fig. 11. Edema and vascularization of the graft are found sev-eral days after PLK in the horse in Figure 10. Fig. 12. A healed PLK site is present 6 weeks postoperatively inthe horse in Figures 10 and 11.

It is not generally recommendedto perform a corneal graft surgery with a diameterlarger than 12 mm due to scarring if good vision isnecessary and expected. Positive visual outcomesfrom PK surgeries can be achieved in 77.9% of thecases. The positive visual outcome rate from PLKsurgeries is near 98.1%, and from DLEK surgeries is89.4%. last medical/surgical procedure for SA is intral- esional injection of the SA with an anti-fungal med-ication, voriconazole, 1%. This procedure has beenperformed horses and on horsesunder general anesthesia. 10The advantages of this procedure are a lower cost and less invasiveprocedure with less anesthetic risk. The risk ofthis procedure is the possibility of introducing aninfectious agent into the anterior chamber with re-sultant endophthalmitis. 10 Acknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veter-inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

(ERU) is the most commoncause of blindness in horses, yet its diagnosis can becomplicated and treatment variably rewarding. The effect of ERU is signicant both in terms ofnancial cost, vision loss, and loss of use, 1yet client compliance with monitoring and treatment recom-mendations are among the most discouraging ofcommon equine ocular complaints that warrant theintervention of a veterinarian. ERU is an immune-mediated form of uveitis that can result in chronic ocular pain and permanentchanges in the eye including cataracts, glaucoma,and retinal detachment. There is no cure for ERU.Treatment is directed at minimizing the frequencyand severity of flare-ups, as well as controlling in-flammation when it occurs. Standard treatment ofERU includes a topical steroid to reduce inflamma-tion, topical atropine to reduce ciliary spasm, pre-vent (NSAID). 2To minimize the frequency and severity of flare-ups of uveitis, an implant wasdeveloped to provide continuous low-dose local de-livery of cyclosporine to the eye. Cyclosporine is animmunosuppressive medication isolated from a fun-gal organism that has been used systemically toprevent organ transplant rejection and to treat im-mune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthri-tis, psoriasis, and dry eye. The frequency of flare-ups in horses treated with cyclosporine implantswas reduced from approximately one per month toapproximately one per year. 3The cyclosporine im- plant takes approximately 6 to 7 weeks after surgeryto deliver therapeutic levels of cyclosporine to theeye. Flare-ups of uveitis still need to be treated,even after placement of the implant. Implants arereported to last 4 to 5 years, even longer in somepatients. The effect of ERU on affected horses and their owners was assessed in one retrospective study of244 ERU patients. 1Not surprisingly, Appaloosas were overrepresented in this study, making up 24%of the sample. However, a somewhat surprisingresult was that on initial examination 28% of eyeswere already blind, and 11% already had glaucoma,suggesting that ERU is often advanced by the time 186 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO ters (either aqueous, serum or both) were positive in46% of 88 horses tested. In terms of outcomes, 29%of included horses were retired from the job per-formed at the time of diagnosis, and 30% performedat a reduced level. Fifteen percent of affected horseswere euthanized and 19% underwent a change in own- ership as a direct result of ERU. In this study,ERU had signicant effect on horses and owners dueto blindness, globe loss, and loss of function. Understanding prognosis for vision in horses with ERU is an important component of owner educa-tion. 4In one long-term study of visual prognosis in 160 horses with ERU followed for 11 years, completeblindness was observed in 20% of horses (32/160),with unilateral blindess in 36% (57/160). 5Appaloo - sas and horses seropositive for Leptospira were at increased risk for blindness. All seropositive Appa-loosas lost vision in at least one eye, and 50% became completely blind; however, 72% of seronegativeAppaloosas lost vision at least one eye, with 29%becoming completely blind. In contrast, 49% ofseropositive horses that were not Appaloosas lostvision in at least one eye, with 17% becoming com-pletely blind, whereas only 34% of seronegativehorses that were not Appaloosas became blind in atleast one eye, with 6% becoming completely blind. The pathogenesis of ERU is an autoimmune re- sponse to a cross-reactive microbial antigen, such asone from a Leptospira organism, or an auto-antigen derived from intraocular tissue itself. 6-8Although leptospirosis is not always implicated in horses withERU, having serum horses with ERU, and thuscollecting serum titers may be warranted for prog-nostic, if not diagnostic, purposes. One commercial vaccine against leptospirosis has recently become available for horses. This vaccineis not designed, nor labeled, as protection against, ortreatment for, ERU, but rather is labeled for useonly in healthy horses. However, in one study us-ing a swine leptospirosis vaccine in horses with ERUto evaluate its effect on frequency of flare-ups, daysto recurrence, and progression of disease, vaccinatedhorses were free of flare-ups for a longer intervalthan unvaccinated horses, although this differenceonly approached statistical signicance. 9Serum ti - ters were measured in both vaccinated and unvac-cinated horses at the beginning of the study, and afairly high percentage of horses in both groups hadtiters /H11022400 prior to vaccination. Being an Appaloosa is associated with an eight- fold increase in likelihood of developing uveitis anda four-fold increase in likelihood of blindness rela-tive to other breeds, so early diagnosis and treat-ment are critical in this breed. 10An insidious form of ERU has been described in Appaloosas that ischaracterized by persistent low-grade uveitis ratherthan recurrent episodes of ocular pain. 11Genes in -volved in coat color have been associated with ERUin Appaloosas, with leopard spotted Appaloosas atincreased risk for insidious ERU relative to otherhorses. 12 Traditional diagnostics schemes are nonspecic, lumping cases with widely variable disease progres-sion under the general category of ERU. Horsesdiagnosed with ERU can include cases that vary insymptoms, stage of presentation, etiology, and prog-nosis. Gilger and Michau were among of ERU: \"clas-sic,\" \"insidious,\" and \"posterior.\" 11Classic ERU is characterized by active inflammatory episodes sep-arated by periods of clinical quiescence. It is notalways clear that an eye that appears clinicallyquiet truly has no ongoing inflammation. InsidiousERU, described most commonly in Appaloosas, ischaracterized by ongoing inflammation that variesin severity with variable overt ocular discomfortthat may not be apparent to the owner. Classic andinsidious ERU may be descriptions of the same dis-ease process that manifests differently depending onpain tolerance. Posterior ERU, as the name im-plies, is characterized by posterior segment (includ-ing the vitreous, retina, and choroid) inflammationwith minimal to no signs of inflammation in theanterior segment (including ocular structures ante-rior to, and including, the lens). Posterior ERU,described most commonly in Warmblood and draftbreeds, can be devastating when no ocular signs arenoted until blindness results from cataracts or reti-nal detachment. Gilger and Michau emphasizedthe very important point that by denition, ERU isa recurrent disease, and thus a diagnosis of ERUcannot be rendered without more than one episodeof uveitis. As a reminder, uveitis in general can beclassied by etiology as due to ocular or systemicdisease, with immune-mediated disease perhapsconsidered a separate category, or a subcategory ofsystemic disease. Uveitis can only be diagnosed asERU with a history of prior episodes of uveitis, orclinical signs consistent with prior episodes of uve-itis, although dening a history of prior episodes canpose a signicant challenge. Fritz and colleagues, in their investigation of the genetic risk factors for ERU in Appaloosas, catego-rized horses into one of ve grades: 1, no observedocular pathology; 2, persistent aqueous flare, miosis, or brin in theanterior chamber. In that study, Grade 5 also wasassigned to horses with signs of persistent uveitisincluding anterior or posterior synechia, cataract,glaucoma, discolored vitreous or peripapillary chori-oretinal scarring. Horses given a Grade 4 or 5 wereused as the affected sample in this study. 12This categorization scheme may not perfectly separate AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 187HOW TO SESSION: OPHTHALMOLOGYhorses that have ERU from horses that do not haveERU, because horses may have active or inactivedisease without any history or signs of recurrence.However, the attempt to grade disease severity withspecic criteria in a rank-ordered manner is a veryimportant step to better dene, and thus improveour ability to diagnose and treat this disease. The goals of this paper are three-fold: 1) to de- ne a reliable and valid set of diagnostic criteria forhorses with ERU, 2) to develop a categorizationscheme to capture disease severity and prognosisthat would result in assignment of a disease cate-gory to each patient diagnosed with ERU, and 3) topresent a protocol for therapy and continued moni-toring that would minimize cost and maximize com-pliance and positive outcomes. The mainstay ofthis approach is clear and documented communica-tion regarding history, clinical signs, categorical di-agnosis, and treatment recommendations. 2. Materials and Methods A systematic approach to ERU diagnosis and ther-apeutics is proposed, with a decision tree developedto standardize and make explicit each step. Ahorse may enter the decision tree one of two ways:1) the presenting complaint is uveitis, and the vet-erinarian needs to decide if the diagnosis is correct,or 2) the presenting complaint is something moregeneral like red eye, cloudy eye, squinting, or tear-ing, and the veterinarian needs to decide whetheruveitis is the underlying cause. In some sense, thepresenting complaint almost does not matter, as thediagnosis of ERU must be based both on history andclinical signs.To diagnose a horse with ERU, two conditions must be met: the horse must have or have had UVEITIS , and the uveitis must be RECURRENT (Fig. 1). First, the UVEITIS criterion must be satis- ed. There are three ways to satisfy this criterion. 1.HISTORY : the horse must have had a his- tory of at least one episode of clinical signsconsistent with uveitis. 2.INACTIVE SIGNS : the horse must have clinical signs that would result from a priorepisode of uveitis. 3.ACTIVE SIGNS : the horse must be in the midst of an active episode of uveitis at thetime of diagnosis. Second, the RECURRENT criterion must be met. This is accomplished by satisfying one of the threeuveitis criteria already described (history, inactivesigns, or active signs) a second time, with someconstraints that ensure that at least two episodes ofuveitis have occurred. 1. If the UVEITIS criterion was satised by HISTORY , the RECURRENCE criterion can be satised by either a second HISTORY or by ACTIVE SIGNS , but not inactive signs, as inactive signs might be a result ofthe same episode that was captured in thehistory. 2. If the UVEITIS criterion was satised by INACTIVE SIGNS , the RECURRENCE criterion must be satised by ACTIVE SIGNS , but not history or inactive signs, Fig. 1. Decision tree for diagnosis of ERU. 188 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO SESSION: OPHTHALMOLOGYgiven that either might be a result of thesame episode that resulted in the inactivesigns. 3. If the UVEITIS criterion was satised by ACTIVE SIGNS , theRECURRENCE cri- can by HISTORY or SIGNS . More specic information regarding the three waysto satisfy criteria follows. 1.HISTORY : Obtain a complete ophthalmic history, including any episodes of squinting,redness, cloudiness, or tearing, regardless ofthe owner's explanation for the clinical signs(e.g., it is not uncommon for an owner of ahorse with ERU to claim that the horse hasnever had an episode of uveitis, but has al-lergies). The ophthalmic history shouldalso include a history of any medications,systemic and topical, that have been given toaddress any ophthalmic complaint. 2.INACTIVE SIGNS : After performing a complete ophthalmic exam including fluores-cein stain, tonometry, and fundic exam, deter- mine whether any inactive signs suggestingprior uveitis, that may or may not have beendetected, are present, including corporanigra or iris atrophy, anterior or posteriorsynechiae, iris hyperpigmentation or depig-mentation, pigment rests on the anteriorlens capsule suggesting prior posterior syn-echiae, cataract, vitritis, or chorioretinalscar, which could be focal/pinpoint or peri-papillary. None of these in isolation are suf-cient to diagnose ERU, but they provideevidence that a prior episode of uveitis mayhave occurred. 3.ACTIVE SIGNS : Also subsequent to the complete ophthalmic examination, deter-mine whether any active signs chorioretinitis edema and hemorrhage. Again,none of these are sufcient to diagnose ERU,but they provide evidence that a current ep-isode of uveitis may be occurring. If both the UVEITIS andRECURRENT criteria have been met, a diagnosis of ERU can be made.The disease can be further classied as classic, in-sidious, or posterior, 11with classic and insidious cases determined primarily by history, and posteriorcases determined by the physical location of inflam-mation (i.e., the absence of anterior segment signs).Long-term followup of cases that fall into these threecategories may yield prognostic information aboutthe visual outcome and progression of these cases. A modication of the scheme developed by Fritz and colleagues 12may provide a categorization scheme to capture disease severity and prognosisthat would result in assignment of a disease cate-gory to each patient diagnosed with ERU. For ex-ample, the following categories are potentiallyaligned with disease severity and duration: Grade 0: no observed ocular pathology. See Figs. 2 and 3. Grade 1: no signs of active uveitis but signs of inactive uveitis are present, suggesting a prior epi-sode (e.g., iris atrophy, anterior orposterior synechiae, hyperpigmentation or de-pigmentation, pigment suggesting prior posterior synechiae, cata-ract, vitritis, or chorioretinal scar, which could be Fig. 2. ERU Grade 0, normal equine eye. Note normal varia-tion in brown iris pigmentation. Fig. 3. ERU Grade 0, normal equine eye. Note distinct grayappearance of normal iridocorneal angle at junction of brown irisand peripapillary, but does not seem tosignicantly affect vision). See Figs. 4, 5, and 6. Grade 2: mild signs of active uveitis, particularly those that improve or resolve with short-term tradi-tional therapy (e.g., topical steroid, systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, and/or topical atropine), including mild mild conjunctival hyperemia, and sub-tle miosis 7). Grade 3: moderate signs of active uveitis, includ- ing well as secondary com-plications including incipient cataracts (Figs. 8-10). Grade 4: severe signs of active uveitis, including profuse epiphora, severe blepharospasm secondary complica-tions including immature, mature, or hypermaturecataract, glaucoma, and retinal detachment (Figs.11-13). Grade 5: blind \"end stage\" eye (i.e., phthisis bulbi), which may or may not be associated with chronic pain(Figs. 14 and 15). Figs. 16 and 17 illustrate an iris color change from blue to yellow associated with active uveitis. Theblue color will return to the iris when uveitis re-solves. Fig. 18 depicts bullethole lesions, or pin-point chorioretinal scars, in a horse with ERU. After a diagnosis of ERU is made, a treatment plan is developed that must include a plan for treat-ing active disease, a plan for monitoring response totherapy, a plan for followup, and a plan for what todo if the patient's condition changes. The most suc-cessful therapeutic plan will consider any pre-exist-ing systemic or ocular conditions that limit the use Fig. 4. ERU Grade 1, no active signs of uveitis but iris hyper-pigmentation suggesting prior episodes of uveitis. Fig. 5. ERU Grade 1, no active signs of uveitis but uniform darkbrown appearance of iris, suggesting iris hyperpigmentationcaused by prior episodes of uveitis. Fig. 6. ERU Grade 1, no active signs of uveitis but maturecataract is visible as a white opacity involving the entire area ofthe lens that can be seen through the pupil. Fig. 7. ERU Grade 2, mild active signs of uveitis as well as irishyperpigmentation and depigmentation caused therapy, the owner's interest in andability to treat the horse, and the owner's nancialconstraints. Standard treatment of ERU includes a topical ste- roid to reduce inflammation, topical atropine posterior synechiae andstabilize intraocular vasculature, systemicNSAID. No treatment is necessary for horses clas-sied Grade 0 (no signs of ocular pathology) orGrade 1 (inactive disease only). Both the aggres-siveness of therapy and the frequency of recheckexaminations to monitor response to treatmentshould increase as the diagnostic category increasesfrom Grade 2 (mild active uveitis) to Grade 3 (mod-erate active uveitis) and Grade 4 (severe active uve-itis). For example, a Grade 2 horse might receive acourse of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory decreas-ing in dose over 3 to 5 days (e.g., flunixin meglumine1.1 mg/kg twice daily for 2 days, 0.5 mg/kg twicedaily for 1 to 2 days, and 0.5 mg/kg once daily for 1to 2 days), along with a topical steroid twice daily(assuming no contraindication for its use), and asingle dose of topical 1% atropine (again, assumingno contraindication for its use), with a plan to re-check in approximately 5 to 7 days to ensure thatuveitis has improved or resolved prior to discontin-uing therapy. A Grade 3 horse might receive alonger course of a systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflam-matory (e.g., flunixin meglumine 1.1 mg/kg twice Fig. 8. ERU Grade 3, moderate active signs of uveitis includingcorneal edema, epiphora (not pictured) and aqueous flare (notvisible in this photograph). Fig. 9.

This eye retained good func-tional vision. Fig. 11. Grade 4, severe active signs of uveitis including uncon-trolled glaucoma with for 3 to 5 days, 0.5 mg/kg twice daily for 3 to 5days, 0.25 mg/kg twice daily for 3 to 5 days, and 0.25mg/kg once daily for 3 to 5 days), along with a topicalsteroid 3 to 4 times daily for 1 week, then twice dailyfor 1 week, and once daily until uveitis resolves, aswell as topical 1% atropine once daily for 1 week,then three times weekly for 1 to 2 weeks, and onceweekly for 1 to 2 weeks, with a plan to recheckinitially after approximately 3 to 5 days to ensurethat uveitis has improved, and then weekly to en-sure that uveitis has resolved prior to discontinuingtherapy. A Grade 4 horse may be treated similarly toa Grade 3 horse but for longer duration and moreaggressively, considering the use of systemic corti-costeroids (if not contraindicated) initially, insteadof systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. Re-check examinations on these patients should occurevery few days, with hospitalization if treatmentfrequency or recheck frequency cannot be accommo-dated at the home barn. In addition, therapy fortreatable secondary complications must be insti-tuted (e.g., timolol/dorzolamide for glaucoma). AGrade 5 horse may need treatment if there is detect-able pain associated with phthisis bulbi, and enucle-ation may be warranted. A discussion of surgical therapy for uveitis is be- yond the scope of this paper, however it is importantto recognize that surgical therapies exist, includingplacement of a cyclosporine implant in the supracho- Fig. 12.

Regarding the treatment of ERU that has been classied as anterior, insidious and posterior, it isreally disease severity that should dictate the fre-quency and duration of treatment; however, specialnote should be taken of three considerations. First,insidious ERU by its very nature implies ongoinginflammation, and therefore horses with insidiousERU would likely best be served by continuous ther-apy to minimize flare-ups. The decision to institutecontinuous therapy must be weighed with the antic-ipated level of owner compliance with recheck ex- amination recommendations, as long-term topical and/or systemic immunosuppressive or anti-inflam-matory therapy carries a risk of a variety of compli-cations. Second, uveitis in horses with posteriorERU may be difcult to detect given the posteriorlocation of the signs, and therefore therapy shouldbe discontinued only after careful examination of theposterior, as well as anterior, segments conrmsthat uveitis has resolved. Finally, because poste-rior ERU occurs in the posterior segment of the eye,topical therapy with ophthalmic medications are un-likely to reach the back of the eye, and thereforesystemic therapy is important. 3. Results There is really no way to demonstrate that an ERUdiagnostic scheme \"works\" as there is no indepen-dent way to conrm the diagnosis, and there is nocure for the disease. The proposed diagnosticscheme and treatment recommendations are sim-ply proposals to encourage necessary and suf-cient information be included from the history, inthe ocular examination, and in treatment and fol-low-up recommendations. 4. Discussion The challenges associated with diagnosing andtreating horses with ERU include uncertainty in thehistory, ambiguity in the diagnosis, noncomplianceor misunderstanding treatment recommendations,and the client simply giving up on the horse. Byhaving a well-dened protocol for history, ocularexamination, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-upplan, these challenges can be minimized. In addi-tion, clear communication with owners about diag-nosis, prognosis, and treatment options is veryimportant. First, it is critical to ensure that owners under- stand that ERU is a lifelong inflammatory diseasefor which there is no cure. Systemic conditionsthat may limit the use of traditional therapy includeright dorsal colitis, renal insufciency, and laminitis,all of which limit the ability to use systemic anti-inflammatory drugs to treat episodes of uveitis (therst two limiting the use of systemic NSAIDs and thelast limiting the use of systemic corticosteroids).

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 193HOW TO SESSION: OPHTHALMOLOGYSecond, owners may not be interested in commit- ting to lifelong treatment if the horse's intended useis limited by ERU, or may not be able to managechronic or recurrent treatment of fractious horses.In these cases, a more permanent solution (e.g.,enucleation of a chronically blind and painful eye)may avoid unnecessary pain for the horse and ex-pense for the owner. Sometimes, secondary oculardisease such as corneal ulceration develops, andowners do not always clearly understand that suchsecondary disease is temporary rather than alsochronic and recurrent. Finally, nancial constraints may prevent owners from being able to commit to treatment of chronic orrecurrent inflammatory ocular disease, and thus,again, a more permanent solution may be war-ranted. Sometimes owners do not have a realisticidea of the necessary duration of treatment and\"give up\" on an eye that could be saved, simplybecause the time or cost involved in therapy wasmore than they realized. In other cases, owners arereluctant to pursue a denitive solution like enucle-ation for a blind painful eye because they do notrealize that horses can have an excellent quality oflife, and even continue to perform in their intendeddiscipline, with only one eye. 13 This paper provides a detailed guide for clinical assessment of horses that present with active signsof intraocular inflammation, and horses whose own-ers know of or suspect previous intraocular inflam-mation. However, in the course of performingroutine physical examinations practitioners oftenidentify horses with one or more signs of inactiveuveitis in one or both eyes that no one has previouslynoted. A history may not be available, and theowner may be unaware that any ocular problemexists. As the historical component of the algo-rithm described in this paper is missing, the clini-cian may be uncertain of the diagnosis. Thesecases offer the opportunity to inform the owner as tothe possibility of an ERU diagnosis. The clinicianshould educate the owner about clinical signs thatmight indicate onset of an episode of active uveitisand emphasize the need for prompt veterinary eval-uation if any such signs occur. In the absence ofacute signs, frequent ophthalmic evaluation shouldbe scheduled to look for progression of disease.Cases of ERU will thus be conrmed by a lateroccurrence of an active flare, or the progression ofintraocular inflammation or inactive signs overtime. Treatment decisions can thus be made ac-cording to the parameters described previously.We know that ERU carries a guarded visual prog- nosis, but we do not currently know which cases aregoing to become blind, or how soon severe progressionwill occur. This scheme is one step in attempting tomore specically characterize disease severity, whichcan provide information about visual prognosis andultimately help guide therapy.

Introduction Umbilical remnant infections and patent urachusare an important cause of morbidity in foals. Riskfactors for post-operative complications or mortalityafter surgical removal are poorly described. 2. Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of foals undergoing umbilicalresection due to patent and/or infected umbilicalremnants at the Marion duPont Scott Equine Med-ical Center from 2004 to 2016 were included in thestudy. Associations between outcome and risk fac-tors were assessed using bivariable and multivari-able analyses. 3. Results Eighty-two foals underwent umbilical remnant re-section of which 73 (89%) survived to discharge.The urachus was the most commonly affected struc-ture being patent and/or infected in 84.1% of cases.Concurrent conditions were present in 60.6% of foalsprior to surgery, with diarrhea and septic jointsbeing most common. The presence of preoperativeseptic joints resulted in signicantly decreased sur-vival ( P/H11005.004). Development of a new septic joint after surgery was the only complication associatedwith increased mortality ( P/H11005.0041). Longer an- esthesia time was associated with increased risk forpostoperative complications ( P/H11005.0015).

Biological wound dressings, such asequine amnion, offer many advantages in themanagement of these wounds, including promo-tion of wound contraction and epithelializationwithout increasing the risk of exuberant granula-tion tissue formation. 1Amnion is the innermost layer of fetal membranes and is composed of asingle layer of cuboidal epithelial cells, a base-ment membrane, and a connective tissue layerthat is markedly thicker in the horse comparedwith other species (Fig. 1). 2Amnion contains nu- merous factors that promote growth and woundhealing, including epidermal growth factor, vascu-lar endothelial growth factor, and transforminggrowth factor beta, among others. 3It has been found to enhance neovascularization, modulateproduction of inflammatory mediators, and recruitstem cells to wound beds. 4,5 The use of amnion as a biologic dressing for the treatment of nonhealing wounds and as a surfacedressing for burns or over skin grafts has been re-ported in the human literature starting in the early1900s. 6-9In the equine literature, the use of am-nion as a wound dressing has been investigatedunder experimental conditions and reported in alimited number of clinical cases. 10In experimen- tally created wounds (2.5 cm /H110032.5 cm) over the dorsal aspect of the cannon bone in horses and po-nies with and without pinch grafting, respectively,those treated with amnion healed faster and re-quired less intervention for exuberant granulationtissue than did control wounds covered with a non-adherent dressing. 11,12The use of equine amnion to treat full-thickness experimental skin wounds indogs has also been reported to increase rates ofcontraction and epithelialization and decrease heal-ing time compared with wounds treated with alter-native dressings. 13 A commercial equine amnion product, available as a shelf-stable sheet and as a liquid, has recentlycome on the market. aHowever, during foaling sea- son, fresh amnion is readily available to many prac-titioners and can be processed and stored for lateruse. A single placenta can yield dozens of amniondressings that are easily trimmed to an appropriatesize for a wide variety of wounds. There are twopublished tissue-preparation protocols, one using di-lute chlorhexidine (rst reported by Ramsey et al 13) and the other using iodine and acetic acid (rstreported by Bigbie et al 10).

Sterile impervious drape. Towel. Mayo or Metzenbaum scissors, saline, alcohol) and 5% acetic acid. Storage containers (will vary based on size and storage conditions, but can use saline bottles,sterile specimen cups, 50-mL conical tubes,etc.) Amnion Collection and Initial Preparation Fresh amnion should be collected and processingbegun as soon as possible after foaling (preferablywithin 1 hour). Only amnion that is grossly normalin appearance should be used. If there must be adelay in processing (up to 12 hours), the amnionshould be refrigerated in a clean plastic bag or rectalsleeve. Gross debris (bedding, dirt, hair, blood,etc.) should be removed by rinsing and gentle agita-tion in cool tap water (Fig. 2). We have found thatusing warm/hot water increases tissue edema dur-ing rinsing. If there are areas of the amnion withground-in dirt or debris, these can be cut out anddiscarded. The volumes in the following protocols are suf- cient to process amnion from an average-sized horseplacenta. However, they can be scaled up or downas needed. Processing\u2014Chlorhexidine Protocol 1. Add 10 mL 2% chlorhexidine to 400 mL sterile saline (room temperature) in a pan (or bucket)to create a 0.05% solution. 2. Add amnion, allow to sit for 1 hour at room temperature, agitating periodically (Fig. 3). 3. Sequentially rinse amnion in 0.05% chlorhexi- dine and sterile saline, three times; havingtwo pans (or buckets) available, one for thechlorhexidine solution and one for the saline,facilitates this process. Each rinse shouldtake 2-3 minutes, with gentle agitation to fa-cilitate the removal of any remaining debris. 4. After nal saline rinse, spread amnion out on a sterile impervious drape (towel underneathfacilitates cleanup) and cut to desired size forfuture use. 5.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 201HOW TO a 1000-mL saline bottle is recom-mended; in this case, add 6.25 mL 2%chlorhexidine to 500 mL sterile saline in thebottle. Each bottle will easily hold approxi-mately a third to half of the amnion from anormal-sized placenta (Fig. 4). Processing\u2014Iodine/Acetic Acid Protocol 1. Add 250 mL 7.2% povidone iodine to 600 mL sterile saline (room temperature) to createa 2% solution in a 1000-mL saline bot-tle. The iodine solution used for this stepmust not contain isopropyl alcohol or thetissue will become dehydrated and not us-able. Each bottle prepared in this mannerwill hold a third to half of the amnion from anormal-sized placenta; there may be someoverflow. 2. Add amnion to the bottle, agitate gently until completely submerged, and refrigerate at 4\u00b0Cfor 24 hours (Fig. 5). 3. Create a 0.25% rinse and storage solution by adding 20 mL 5% acetic acid to 400 mL sterilesaline in a pan (or bucket). 4. Rinse the amnion three times in sterile saline, then once in the acetic acid solution. As men-tioned previously, having two pans (or buck-ets) available to transfer the amnion betweenrinses facilitates this process. Each rinseshould take 2-3 minutes, with gentle agita-tion to facilitate the removal of any remainingdebris. 5. After nal saline rinse, spread amnion out on a sterile impervious drape (towel underneathfacilitates cleanup) and cut to desired size forfuture use (Fig. 6). 6. Store samples in 0.25% acetic acid (as de- scribed in step 3; 5 mL 5% acetic acid per 100mL sterile saline). If planning to store in therefrigerator, use of a 1000-mL saline bottle isrecommended; in this case, add 25 mL 5%acetic acid to 500 mL sterile saline in thebottle. Each bottle will easily hold approxi-mately a third to half of the amnion from anormal sized placenta (Fig. 4). Storage Amnion may be stored in temperature-appropriatecontainers in the refrigerator (4\u00b0C) or freezer Fig. 4.

In the initial descriptions of these processing protocols in the literature, refriger-ated samples stored in either dilute chlorhexidine ordilute acetic acid were free of bacterial contamina-tion when tested at 6 months and 5 months afterprocessing, respectively. 10,13When using thawed frozen dressings, Bigbie et al11reported discarding any tissue that remained after 3 weeks. Storagecontainers should be labeled with the processingdate.3. Results Both amnion-processing protocols can be performedwith minimal setup and no specialized equipment.Both are effective at eliminating bacterial contami-nation from equine amnion and result in dressingsthat can be stored for prolonged periods of time. 10,13 Thus, selection of protocol may be largely dependenton personal preference. However, we have foundsome minor differences between the protocols thatmay sway a practitioner one way or another. Forexample, samples treated with chlorhexidine seemto be more prone to becoming edematous and sepa-rating (the vascular layer from the avascular layer)during processing. We have found markedly edem-atous tissue more difcult to use clinically and typ-ically choose to discard it. Although the use ofroom temperature, rather than warm saline forrinses helps to address this issue, it does not elimi-nate it completely. This does not seem to be a prob-lem with tissue processed with iodine/acetic acid,even when the tissue is from the same horse. Incontrast, there is routinely tissue debris left in thesaline rinses for the iodine/acetic acid protocol, sug-gesting that the 24-hour refrigeration in iodine mayresult in some level of damage to the surface layersof the tissue. We have not found this to be a prob-lem clinically when using amnion processed in thisway, but further investigation (i.e., histopathology)may be warranted. The iodine also stains the am-nion a yellow color with variable intensity, whichmay be cosmetically undesirable (Fig. 6) although itshould not affect efcacy. Fig. 6. Iodine-processed pieces cut into 5 cm /H110035 cm squares for future use, prior to refrigeration or freezing. Fig. 7.

We have used both of the processingprotocols described above, and prefer to refrigeratethe amnion dressings in their respective storage so-lutions in 1000-mL saline bottles until use, as shownin Fig. 4. We have also experimentally storedamnion at both /H1100220\u00b0C and /H1100280\u00b0C. Subjectively, tissue stored at /H1100220\u00b0C has a more \"wrinkled\" ap- pearance immediately after being thawed than tis-sue that has been refrigerated or stored at /H1100280\u00b0C. This makes the tissue somewhat more difcult tomanipulate; based on this experience and previousreports, 10,11thawing tissue in the refrigerator for 24 hours before use would be recommended. Amnion dressings are quite economical; following either protocol, the cost to process the amnion fromone placenta is approximately $25-30, and this tis-sue can subsequently be used for dozens of dressings(depending on wound size), making the cost perbandage change less than $1. By comparison, com-mercially available, nonbiologic, \"active\" dressingsintended to promote wound healing pricefrom $2.50-15.00 or more per bandage change.Although amnion can be glued to the skin and al-lowed to desiccate, 1we typically use it underneath a bandage, changing the dressing every 3-7 days de-pending on the type of bandage and the character-istics of the wound. Given the lengthy healing timefor many wounds healing by second intention, it isnot difcult to imagine that the cost differential canbe substantial. We have found equine amnion to be a valuable addition to our toolkit for managing wounds healingby second intention. The protocols described hereare easy to use and readily adaptable to a widerange of practice situations.

Certain abnormalities, such as longitudinal ber disruption(split) in the suspensory ligament branches may only be evident when imaged NWB. Authors'addresses: Equine Diagnostic 32618 (Werpy,Grifth); injury is oftendiagnosed with ultrasound. To provide the mostaccurate information, ultrasound examinations wouldideally correlate with MRI ndings. In certain cases,there is discrepancy between MRI ndings and ultra-sound imaging characteristics. It is proposed thatweight bearing (WB) during ultrasound examinationcontributes to obscuring certain types of abnormali-ties, specically SLB splits. 2. Methods Ultrasound examination was performed on SLBswith the limbs in WB and nonweight-bearing (NWB)positions. Splits in the SLBs were dened as linearregions of decreased echogenicity when imaged withthe limb in a WB position that increased in size andbecame anechoic with the limb in a NWB position,and were categorized as partial or complete.3. Results Ultrasound examination was performed NWB on 58SLBs, with 13 partial and 12 complete splits identi-ed. Recheck ultrasound examinations performedin four horses up to 10 months following the initialexamination demonstrated persistence of the split inone horse, partial resolution in two horses and com-plete resolution in one horse. 4. Discussion Ultrasound examination using the NWB app-roach is valuable for increasing the conspicuityof lesions that may decrease in size when WB.This technique provides a more accurate re-presentation of the lesion severity and allowsmonitoring over time. A longitudinal study isnecessary to determine the clinical relevance ofNWB ndings. 206 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLAMENESS A TO Z: NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING OLD PROBLEMS Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTESAcknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Authors have adhered to the Principles ofVeterinary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Authors have no conflicts of interest.

Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for the mostcomplete diagnostic imaging of the equine foot, butultrasound is more readily available and less expen- sive. This study compares ultrasound to MRI for diag-nosis of injuries visible with ultrasound within thepalmar foot, including the deep digital flexor tendon(DDFT), collateral sesamoidean ligament (CSL), and na-vicular bursa (NB). 2. Materials and Methods MRI of the foot and ultrasound of the foot betweenthe heel bulbs prior to MRI analysis were acquiredprospectively in clinical patients. 3. Results A total of 70 ultrasound and MRI exams of 45 horseswere included. Ultrasound had good sensitivity (85%),moderate specicity (60%), and accuracy of 70% for eval-uating dorsal DDFT. the navicular bone was identied with MRI in27 limbs, 20 of which also had dorsal damage proximalto the navicular bone identied with ultrasound. 4. Discussion Ultrasound evaluation remains a useful screeningtool, particularly for assessment of DDFT tearingproximal to the navicular bone, but risks underdiag-nosing pathology to the navicular bursa and CSL.Clinically signicant concurrent damage to the distalDDFT and other osseous and soft tissues in the hoofcapsule are unlikely to be identied without MRI.

Authors'addresses: EquiSound, Equine Medical Centre, Ursel, Belgium (Hoegaerts, Hauspie); and De-partment of Environmental and Radiological Health Science, State University, navicular bursa (NB) is a widelyused technique to diagnose and treat horses withnavicular syndrome. Multiple techniques are de-scribed for needle entry into the NB, either underradiographic or ultrasonographic control. 1,2Many of these use a (para)sagittal approach with punctureof the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), which re-mains a concern for many clinicians because it mayproduce adhesions and/or tendon degeneration.Recently, lateral approaches for centesis of the NBhave been described avoiding puncture of the DDFT,either under radiographic or ultrasonographic guid-ance. 3-5The reported ultrasonographic studies used cadaver limbs. The equine foot has a complex anatomy in which the navicular bone acts as a trochlea where theDDFT changes its angle in the foot. The NB is asynovial cavity between the navicular bone andthe DDFT, facilitating sliding of the DDFT. TheNB has a lateral and medial proximal collateralrecess (Fig. 1), which can be imaged with ultra-sound. 6,7As anatomical landmarks of the NB depend on the conformation of the foot, using im-aging to guide the injection is recommended.Based on the visibility of the NB with ultrasound,we developed the following technique for use inthe standing horse. The purpose of this article is to describe an ultra- sound-guided tendon-sparing lateral approach forcentesis of the NB that can be used in a clinicalsetting, presenting it as a valid alternative for themore commonly used (para)sagittal approaches thatpuncture the DDFT. 2. Materials and Methods The limb is clipped at the level of the lateral heel-bulb from the level of the coronary band to midpastern. The hoof and fetlock are covered withbandages and the lateral heelbulb is scrubbed andprepared aseptically. In cases where diagnostic an- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 209LAMENESS A TO Z: NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING OLD PROBLEMS NOTESesthesia of the bursa is desired, the horse is notsedated (or only mildly) and no regional block orlocal desensitization of the skin is performed. Incases where treatment of the NB is performed, thehorse is sedated and a local block or desensitizationof the skin is performed. The leg is placed in a weight-bearing stance with the hoof positioned more caudally than the con-tralateral limb to obtain hyperextension of the cofnjoint and gain better access to the palmar/plantaraspect of the pastern region, similar to the position-ing for a skyline radiograph of the navicular bone(Fig. 2). A microconvex probe, prepared asepticallywith alcohol and covered in a sterile glove, is posi-tioned between the heelbulbs and a transverse viewof the lateral lobe of the DDFT and the lateral recessof the NB is obtained (Fig. 3). A spinal needle(20-21 G, 1.5 in.) is inserted lateral to the trans-ducer and axial to the lateral ungual cartilage, po-sitioned in the plane of the ultrasound beam towardthe lateral recess of the bursa (Fig. 2). The bevel ofthe needle has to be pointed axially to allow the needleto drive toward the sagittal plane when advancingtoward the NB. When the tip of the needle is posi-tioned inside the synovial cavity, the stylette of thespinal needle is removed and a sterile injection can beperformed into the NB (Fig. 3). The injection is mon-itored ultrasonographically to ensure correct needleplacement. In the rst 10 cases, iodinated contrastmaterial was injected to assure the correct placementof the anesthetic solution in the NB by means of radi-ography(Fig. 4); this is recommended when rst using thistechnique. 3. Results During a period of 5 years, 123 feet were injectedusing this technique. In 11 cases ultrasound-guided injection of the NB was not possible because there was no fluid detected inthe NB or the heelbulbs were too narrow to obtain goodimage quality. In the remaining feet, a small (n /H11005 33), moderate (n /H1100541) to large (n /H1100538) amount of fluid was present in the lateral recess of the NB and ultra-sound conrmed the injection was within the NB. Once the needle penetrated the skin, most horses tolerated further needle positioning well. Reducedresistance was noticed when the needle penetratedthe wall of the NB. If a moderate to large amountof fluid was present in the NB, synovial fluid leakedfrom the needle after removal of the stylette (n /H1100579; Fig. 2). Injection of 2 mL was easy to perform with-out any resistance. To prevent extra-synovial leak-age, only a small amount of fluid (1-2 mL) wasinjected. Lifting the limb from the ground immedi-ately after injection is advised to reduce intrasyno-vial pressure and to prevent leakage. Correct intrasynovial injection of the NB was con- rmed by visualization of the distention of the NBduring injection, visualization of injected micro-bubbles and/or aspiration of the injected solutionthrough the needle. In the rst 10 cases, 1 mL ofcontrast agent was added to the anesthetic solution.Radiographic evaluation after injection demon-strated in all 10 cases a distinct lling of the NBwith contrast agent. In three cases a small amountof contrast material leaked from the needle tract. No severe complications were experienced (No in- fectious bursitis, no pain after injection).

In the remaining two cases, weused the technique described by Verschooten et al 8 as this allowed us to restrain the foot in a Hickmanblock. 4. Discussion Performing this procedure is facilitated when donein a dark room with a red light placed on the head ofthe operator. In doing so, the operator can main-tain an overview on both the screen of the ultra-sound machine, as well as the site of injection.Appropriate planning of needle placement is criticalto have a successful procedure. If placed at thelevel of or lateral to the ungual cartilage, needleinsertion is very difcult. If placed too dorsal, nee-dle penetration through the vascular bundle is pos-sible. Detection of fluid in the NB and subsequentneedle placement is facilitated in horses with \"lowheel\" conformation and a wide space in between thebulbs. In horses with high and narrow heels ob-taining good-quality images of the NB is challeng-ing, which compromises accurate needle placement.Therefore, when rst learning the technique, it isideal to begin with horses with a foot conformationthat promotes ultrasononographic visualization ofthe NB and eases needle placement. Puncture of the DDFT is prevented with this method by using a lateral approach and ultrasoundguidance. Recently, other ultrasound-guided DDFT- avoiding approaches were published. One approachused ultrasound guidance on the nonweight-bearinglimb. 5The authors have used this technique and have found that it is more difcult to image smallamounts of fluid and to work aseptically. Others de-scribe an ultrasound-guided approach on the weight-bearing limb. 4However, this study describes the technique in cadaver limbs. To the knowledge of theauthors, this is the rst report of an ultrasound-guidedtendon-sparing lateral approach of the NB in livehorses. 5. Conclusions Tendon-sparing NB injections can be performedwith ultrasound guidance in standing horses. Thisis a safe procedure that avoids potential DDFT com-plications caused by needle penetration.

It is usually diagnosed using a combi-nation of lameness examination, diagnostic nerveblocks, and ultrasound. 2,3The suspensory liga- ment itself is frequently not the only structure af-fected. The metacarpal/metatarsal bone can beaffected as well, and therefore multiple imaging mo-dalities, including radiographs, nuclear scintigra-phy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) areoften needed to fully diagnose the extent of the in-jury. 4,5Injury to the suspensory ligament can be accompanied by enthesopathy characterized by boneloss and/or proliferation at the ligament attach-ment as well as fluid accumulation affectingthe palmar lameness is meta-carpal/metatarsal region, there are additional ab-normalities of note that can be identied withultrasound as well as other methods of imaging.One of the abnormalities that can occur in the prox-imal metacarpal/metatarsal region with a similarclinical presentation as well as blocking pattern as ahorse with primary suspensory ligament disease ispalmar metacarpal osseous axial surface of the second fourth mtc/mtt bonesand the adjacent suspensory ligament margin. Dueto the location of this osseous proliferation, it can beextremely difcult to distinguish it from the axial sur-face of the second or fourth mtc/mtt bones without AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 215LAMENESS A TO Z: NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING OLD PROBLEMS NOTESspecic investigation of this region. The clinical rel-evance of the osseous proliferation can be variabledepending on the size, shape, location, and any adja-cent tissue abnormalities. These specic characteris-tics are evaluated, as is the relationship between theosseous proliferation and the suspensory ligament.This paper will review the anatomy of the proximalpalmar/plantar mtc/mtt region and the relationshipwith the suspensory ligament, mtc/mtt bones, and theinterosseous spaces in conjunction with the ultrasoundtechniques for identifying abnormal osseous prolifera-tion in this region, which can then be incorporated inthe standard ultrasound examination of the proximalmetacarpal region. Basic Anatomy Forelimb Proximal Metacarpus and SuspensoryLigamentThe suspensory ligament attaches at the proximalpalmar aspect of the third metacarpal bone as wellas the distal row of the carpal bones. 3The most proximal and palmar bers are fused with theaccessory ligament of the deep digital flexor ten-don and attach at the palmar tubercles of the thirdand fourth carpal bones. These bers cross thecarpometacarpal joint space and join the mainmetacarpal aspect of the ligament. The mainsagittal section of the ligament originates at theproximopalmar aspect of the third metacarpalbone with two lateral and medial attachments onthe axial surfaces of the second and fourth meta-carpal bones. At the level of the deep palmarmetacarpal artery and vein anastomosis all of theattachments become two (medial and lateral)lobes that will fuse to become the body of theligament. 3The body of the ligament continues distally until the suspensory ligament branches tothen attach on the medial and lateral proximalsesamoid bones. One of the difculties while ul-trasounding can be attributed to the three tissuetypes that make up the ligament consisting oftendon bers, striated muscle, and fat. 3 The palmar margin of the third metacarpal bone is not necessarily flat at the attachment of the sus-pensory ligament. It has a sagittal crest on mid-line, which can vary in size and shape and istypically located at the division between the medialand the lateral suspensory ligament lobes. On ei-ther side of the sagittal crest the palmar surface ofthe third metacarpal bone can be flat to mildly con-cave. At the articulation of the second and fourthmetacarpal bones with the third metacarpal bonesthe interosseous spaces become evident. The in-terosseous space (IOS) can be seen in the proximalone third of the mtc/mtt ending approximately at thelevel of the mid body of the suspensory ligament.The normal suspensory ligament has rounded me-dial and lateral margins immediately distal to theproximal extent of the attachment of the suspensoryligament on the third metacarpal bone.Hind Limb Proximal Metatarsus and SuspensoryLigamentThe suspensory ligament in the hind limb begins asa triangular shape at the proximal aspect of thethird metatarsal bone, being thinner medially thanlaterally. The suspensory ligament in the hind ismore lateral of midline with a close relationship tothe axial aspect of the fourth metatarsal bone, moreimportant proximally than as you move distally onthe leg. There is a larger amount of connectivetissue separating the second metatarsal bone fromthe suspensory ligament. The hind suspensory lig-ament is not bilobed and typically has a prominentarea of central bers as well as peripheral bers,with the fat and muscle distribution being moresymmetrical medially and laterally. As the liga-ment continues distally it becomes heart shaped toround and then oval, until it reaches the level of thebifurcation. 4 2. Materials and MethodsEquipment The ultrasound examinations were performed witha portable GE Logiq e Vet NextGen ultrasound ma-chine with a 7-to-12-MHz linear probe. A standoffpad is not typically used. Ultrasound Examination Specic evaluation of the IOS should be incorpo-rated into the standard ultrasound examination ofthe proximal mtc/mtt region as the clinical presen-tation can be similar to horses with desmopathy ofthe proximal suspensory ligament. The approachand techniques to identify palmar/plantar mtc/mttosseous proliferation and injury to the suspensoryligament are the same. However, specic evalua-tion of the interosseous spaces and the palmar/plan-tar margin of the third mtc/mtt bone is necessary tomake this diagnosis. The evaluation of this region should be performed initially with the limb in the weight-bearing positionusing the palmar approach with assessment of thesuspensory ligament and the mtc/mtt bone margins.During this examination, the probe angles should bevaried to be perpendicular to the surfaces of inter-est. In addition, on and off angle imaging shouldbe used to evaluate the soft tissues and bony sur-faces. Following completion of the standard weight- bearing examination, the suspensory ligament andsurrounding structures should be examined with thelimb in the nonweight-bearing position. This tech-nique uses the flexor tendon laxity to increase thecontact surface of the ultrasound probe allowing com-plete visualization of the suspensory ligament as wellas the axial surfaces of the second and fourth mtc/mttbones and their relationship to the third mtc/mtt bone.In addition, this technique requires less depth allow-ing the use of higher frequency resulting in betterdetail and it makes manipulation of vessels possible,decreasing edge artifact. 4When beginning this 216 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLAMENESS A TO Z: NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING OLD PROBLEMSexam, the ultrasound probe should be positioned par-allel to the third mtc/mtt bone and the focal zonesshould be positioned within the area of interest. Fol-lowing evaluation of the palmar margin of the thirdmtc/mtt bone, the relationship between the third mtc/mtt bone and the second and fourth mtc/mtt bones canbe evaluated. The normal IOSs should be evident asfocal linear echolucencies at the articulations of thethird mtc/mtt bone with the second and the fourthmetacarpal bones. The probe angle can be altered inorder to identify the IOSs and in order to evaluatedeeper into the IOS. The IOS will be identied byeither sliding the probe medially and laterally orchanging the probe angle and fanning. The appropri-ate choice is dependent on the shape and angle of theIOS, and will change with different horses and differ-ent limbs. Regardless of whether sliding or fanningthe probe is most effective, an anechoic linear regionbordered by echogenic margins should be identied.In addition, there should be a thin layer of echogenicconnective tissue between the axial margin of the sec-ond and fourth mtc/mtt bones and the adjacent marginof the suspensory ligament. In contrast, when focal osseous proliferation is present extending from the palmar medial or lateralmargins of the third mtc/mtt bone there is a step,seen as a hyperechoic horizontal line, between thepalmar or plantar margin of the splint bone and thethird mtc/mtt bone that is the result of bone extend-ing from the third mtc/mtt bone across the IOS,which is obscured (Fig. 1). This nding can bequite subtle on the ultrasound images in comparisonwith the MRI and computed tomography (CT) im-ages, given that the size of the step is determined bythe distance between the palmar/plantar margin ofthe mtc/mtt bone and the palmar or plantar extent Fig. 1.

When osseousproliferation is identied, close evaluation of thesuspensory ligament is necessary to determinewhether this abnormality is affecting the suspen-sory ligament. Evaluation of the periligamentousspace should be performed to determine the natureof the tissue between the suspensory ligament andthe osseous proliferation (Figs. 3, and 4). 3. Results Using this technique, the proximal mtc/mtt regioncan be evaluated to identify and specically palmar or plantar affecting the mtc/mttbones. If the proximal mtc/mtt regions are not spe-cically evaluated for a \"step\" as previously de-scribed and the lack of a visible IOS, the osseousproliferation will appear as the normal axial surfaceof the splint. This technique is not difcult to per-form as it is similar to the evaluation of the suspen-sory ligament region and only requires awareness ofthe shape changes in the bone surfaces. This technique has been used to diagnose 13 horses. The information obtained from the ultra-sound examination, as well as other modalitiesin certain cases, was used to determine appropriatecase management, providing information to clini-cians that could be used to determine whether the Fig. 3.

In certain cases, following con-sultation with a board-certied surgeon, surgical re-moval of the osseous proliferation was elected (Fig.6). Factors to consider with regard to this decisioninclude size of the osseous proliferation, extent ofsuspensory ligament injury, amount of periligamen-tous tissue proliferation and possible adhesions, de-gree of lameness, and whether medical managementhad already been attempted. At this time long-term outcomes have not yet been established. Ofthe two horses that had surgery, one is retired due tothe extent of the suspensory ligament injury and oneremains in low level of work. The horses that havebeen medically managed, either still remain in re-habilitation or have not yet reached their previouslevel of activity. More time is needed to determinethe outcomes of these cases. 4. Discussion Suspensory ligament injury is complex and can bethe result of soft tissue injury, osseous abnormali-ties, or a combination of the two. This techniquewill advance the diagnosis of abnormalities in theproximal mtc/mtt region. It should be incorporated Fig. 4.

The radiographs retrospectively have mild opacity superimposed over the medial IOS,although an obvious cause of lameness is not identied on the radiographs. The focal osseous proliferation on the palmar margin ofthe second metacarpal bone was not painful to palpitation and did not have increased radiopharmaceutical uptake.

Close scrutiny of this regionwill allow a diagnosis of the palmar/plantar osse-ous proliferation, which could otherwise easily bemissed. A linear probe is used by the authors to perform this examination. However, a microconvex probecould be used as angling the ultrasound beam par-allel with the IOS will be more easily accomplishedwhen compared with a linear probe. However, theauthors nd that the decreased detail of the micro-convex probe to be prohibitive. This could varyamong cases, operators, and machines. Palmar or plantar osseous proliferation can be visualized on ultrasound examination when the IOSis obscured, typically seen as a step between thethird mtc/mtt bone and either the second or fourthmtc/mtt bones dependent on either medial or laterallocation. It may not always be possible to distin-guish whether the osseous proliferation is from theproximal palmar/plantar third mtc/mtt bone or fromaxial splint bone proliferation on ultrasound exam-ination. However, advanced imaging can be usedwhen needed, and will provide more detailed infor-mation about the suspensory ligament and sur-rounding soft tissue, which will be valuableinformation in determining appropriate case man-agement. Management of these cases requires anaccurate assessment of the amount and severity ofthe suspensory ligament injury, if any, and a similarassessment of the bone. This will directly affectmanagement and prognosis. If this cannot beachieved, then advanced imaging should be used todetermine the clinical relevance of the ultrasoundndings.

Introduction A horse owner recently \"Gee it seemslike hindlimb proximal suspensory desmitis is anepidemic among horses. I do not remember thisproblem from 20 or 30 years ago.\" It is true thatsince the mid 1990s, chronic hindlimb proximalsuspensory desmitis has been diagnosed with in-creasing frequency 1,2and although it is possible that the disease process is occurring more fre-quently, it is just as likely that we are simplygetting better at recognizing and diagnosing theproblem. How to diagnose these injuries hasbeen discussed previously and is beyond the scopeof this paper. Although not discussed in this pa-per, localization and imaging remain importantbecause still, even with advanced local anestheticand imaging techniques, hind-limb proximal sus-pensory desmitis can be a hard diagnosis to make.This is due to the insidious onset of a commonlybilateral problem, which makes recognition ofovert lameness difcult, the overlap of localizingblocks with other common diagnoses, the positiveclinical response to treatments for other commondiagnoses, and the inherent difculty of imagingthe origin of the hindlimb suspensory. Once diagnosed, the majority of horses with chronic hindlimb proximal suspensory desmitistreated with rest or medical therapy remain orhave recurrent lameness after returning towork. 1,3,4The most often-cited theory for persis- tent lameness despite appropriate therapeutic pro-grams is development of a compartment syndrome,in that the enlarged proximal suspensory ligamentcauses compression of and pain from the deepbranch of the lateral plantar nerve (DBLPN), 5sus- pensory ligament, and underlying bone due to re-striction from the deep plantar fascia. SinceAndy Bathe performed his rst hindlimb fas-ciotomy and neurectomy procedure in the latenineties and reported his ndings at the annualmeeting of the European College of VeterinarySurgeons (ACVS) in 2001 and later at the annualmeeting of the American College of VeterinarySurgeons (ACVS), 6the procedure has become widespread in use. Several factors that should beconsidered prior to recommending surgery andwill be outlined here. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 227LAMENESS A TO Z: NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING OLD PROBLEMS NOTES2. Materials and MethodsHow to Select Cases Arguably the most important factor in selectingcases for fasciotomy and neurectomy is a correctdiagnosis. In a nutshell, the lameness or perfor-mance problem must signicantly improve after di-agnostic anesthesia of the suspensory ligamentregion and the imaging of the suspensory ligamentshould match the clinical problem. In other words,if the lameness is severe and the imaging abnormal-ities of the suspensory ligament are mild or equivo-cal, other causes of lameness should be investigated.Some examples of other diagnoses we have madewhen the lameness blocked to a \"suspensory block\"have been third and central tarsal subchondral bonecysts edema metatarsus, withthese pathologies blocked \"suspensoryblocks\" including DBLPN, direct suspensory liga-ment infusion and tibial nerve, it is unlikely thatfasciotomy and neurectomy would improve the asso-ciated lameness. Fig. 1 is an example of such a case: the horse was a 7-year-old Quarter Horse gelding used as aHunter, whose lameness resolved with a numberof \"suspensory blocks\" but he did not have suspen- sory injury. The horse had a moderate-to-marked3/5 right hindlimb lameness that switched to a mild3/5 left hindlimb lameness after a direct infusionblock of the suspensory ligament (6 mL). On theMRI, there are nearly matching subchondral bonecysts in the third tarsal bones with surroundingbone sclerosis (right worse than left). The suspen-sory ligaments were within normal limits. Diag-nostic blocks were repeated after the MRI. Both alow-volume (3mL) DBLPN and a tibial nerve block(repeated on a different day) resolved the righthindlimb lameness and switched the horse to a mildleft hindlimb lameness. Arthrodesis of the distalhock joints with articular drilling and application ofbone plates was performed. The horse was soundand returned to full work including jumping 8months later, and remained sound for available fol-low up of 18 months. This case is a good example ofthree different \"suspensory blocks,\" local infusion,DBLPN and tibial nerve, problem signicantly improve with diagnos- Fig. 1.

Caretshighlight the cyst-like lesions. 228 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSLAMENESS TO Z: NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING OLD PROBLEMStic anesthesia of the suspensory ligament region andthe degree of injury during imaging of the suspen-sory ligament should match the clinical problem, butsome have advocated that horses with concurrentbone lesions are not ideal candidates for fasciotomyand neurectomy. This is because of the concernthat the lameness or performance problem will notrespond as thoroughly or favorably to fasciotomyand neurectomy when there is concurrent bone pa-thology 6,7although this has not always been our experience (Fig. 2). The horse in Fig. 2 had a mod-erate-to-severe right hindlimb lameness (3/5) mL) DBLPN. On MR images, in addition to sig-nicant enlargement with abnormal signal intensityand pattern of is marked the proximal meta-tarsus. Despite severity of suspensory ligament in-jury and severity of concomitant bone lesions, therewas lameness resolution with return to upper level3-day-eventing competition for the available followup of 1.5 years following a fasciotomy and neurec-tomy. This horse is a good example of severe bonyabnormalities on MRI that did not seem to nega-tively affect prognosis after a fasciotomy and neurec-tomy. Therefore, we do not think that concomitantbone lesions of the proximal plantar metatarsus area strict contraindication for fasciotomy and neurec-tomy; rather, we discussed with the owner that itmay or may not negatively impact prognosis depend-ing on the type and severity of the bone lesion. Finally, lameness at secondary sites such as sac- roiliac- or thoracolumbar-associated lameness arethought long-standingproximal hindlimb suspensory desmitis. 8There - fore, when the history and diagnostics indicate avery chronic injury, the clinician should examine thehorse specically for sacroiliac- or thoracolumbar-associated lameness. When it is present, it maylimit the prognosis for resolution of the performanceproblem post fasciotomy and neurectomy. How-ever, without surgery, it is unlikely that thesehorses will have any improvement in the perfor-mance problem or lameness. Additionally, it hasbeen our experience and that of others (Andy Bathe,personal communication; March 12, 2017) that sec-ondary sites of lameness in some horses can improveafter the inciting problem is addressed with fas-ciotomy and neurectomy. Certainly, any other concurrent hindlimb lameness, whether secondaryto the suspensory injury or not, should be kept inmind when recommending fasciotomy and neurec-tomy. Obviously fasciotomy and neurectomy willnot address pre-existing secondary sites of lame-ness that are independent of suspensory injuryand if precludes athleticfunction, the fasciotomy and neurectomy shouldnot be recommended. How to Avoid Complications There are a few contraindications to a fasciotomyand neurectomy procedure. 1. and neurec-tomy. This conformation is known to signif-icantly increase the risk of catastrophicfailure of the suspensory apparatus followingfasciotomy and neurectomy and thus the pro-cedure should not be recommended in thesecases 8(Fig. 3 ). If this complication were to occur, the horse may require fetlock arthrode-sis of the affected limb(s) to survive long term. 2. Acute injury to the proximal suspensory liga- ment is a contraindication proximal ligamentto be rare in our practice of mainly sporthorses, if the acute vs chronic nature is notobvious based upon clinical and ultrasono-graphic examination, we always recommendMRI to further delineate acute vs chronic in-jury. We think this is because denervation ofthe acutely injured suspensory ligament couldlead to lesion expansion secondary to in-creased loading of the acutely injured suspen-sory ligament. An alternative approachwould be to perform the fasciotomy and Fig. 2. PD-weighted MR images from a 16-year-old Thorough-bred used for upper level 3-day-eventing with suspensory liga-ment injury and concomitant bone lesion. A, Dotted lines at b)and c) on the sagittal image correspond respectively to transverseimages (B and C). Carets to Z: NEW TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING OLD PROBLEMSneurectomy, followed by a signicantly longerrest and rehabilitation program. But we al-ways choose to treat the acute suspensoryligament injury rst, recommending the fas-ciotomy and neurectomy only after the acutesuspensory ligament injury has healed andbecome chronic with continued lameness. 3. Other concurrent hindlimb lameness, when not secondary to the chronic suspensory associatedlameness, should be kept in mind when recom-mending fasciotomy neurectomy. If thesecond the and neurectomy should notbe recommended. The Procedure The fasciotomy portion of the procedure is aimed atsharp transection of the plantar fascia overlying thesuspensory in immediatedecompression of the suspensory ligament, DBLPN,and bone due to the presumed compartment syn-drome. The neurectomy portion of the procedure isaimed at removal of an approximately 2- to 3-cmsection of the DBLPN from its origin off the lateralplantar nerve to just proximal to the proximal bor-der plantar fascia where the DBLPN fascia. Removal of the nerve results inimmediate desensitization of the origin of the sus-pensory atrophy of themuscle bers 9within the suspensory ligament. In our practice of mostly sport horses, bilateral fas-ciotomy and neurectomy is by far more commonthan unilateral surgery due to the preponderance ofbilateral injury. Whether an apparently normalcontralateral limb should also receive fasciotomyand neurectomy during the same surgical episodewhen the diagnosis has been made unilaterally iscurrently unknown. 8 How to Manage in Postoperative Period The postoperative care of fasciotomy and neurec-tomy is somewhat variable among surgeons, butgenerally consists of 2 to 3 weeks of bandaging fol-lowed by 2 to 6 weeks of walking and/or walking andtrotting exercise. 7,8When the suspensory lame - ness is mild, bilateral, and/or very chronic, there isoften secondary atrophy of the gluteal musculaturethat should be addressed with a longer period ofwalking under saddle and other conditioning exer-cises prior to resumption of full work. We advocate a recheck ultrasound examination prior to resumption of canter work under saddle.In our practice, this is 2 months from surgery.This exam is to check for iatrogenic lesions on theplantar surface of the suspensory ligament that canoccur but do not appear to affect prognosis 8as well as new injury to the suspensory ligament. We havebegun recommending this recheck ultrasound exambecause of rare anecdotal reports of catastrophicsuspensory ligament injury in the rst 4 monthsafter fasciotomy and neurectomy, even when thehindlimb conformation was pre-operatively. 7,8At the recheck ultrasound, if the preoperative ultrasound was abnormal, the suspen- Fig. 3.

Additionally, it is our im- pression that the area of the deep plantar hypoechoic and slightly thickened when com-pared with preoperative sonograms at early re-checks. muscle bers8,9contribute to the smaller and more normal appearance of the suspen-sory ligament after surgery. It has also been noted that some horses will need intra-articular injection of corticosteroid to the tar-sometatarsal joint as they return to full work after afasciotomy and neurectomy. 8This may be because of biomechanical changes to the suspensory appara-tus secondary to muscle ber atrophy 8or it could be due to other factors. 3. Results When cases are selected appropriately for fas-ciotomy and neurectomy, the complication rate isvery low and the prognosis for full return to work isvery good with approximately 80% of horses return-ing to the previous level of work for at least 1 year. 6,8 It has been our experience and that of others (SueDyson, personal communication; Focus of Soft Tis-sue Lameness, New Orleans, LA, 2016) that whenthe horse responds favorably to fasciotomy andneurectomy, the long-term outcome beyond 1 year isexcellent. This is in contrast with neurectomy ofthe palmar digital nerves for foot lameness, whererecurrent lameness is an expected long-term resultsecondary to re-innervation. think the im-proved ultrasonographic appearance postopera-tively of the suspensory ligament in size, shape, andpattern, or the possible permanence of the fas-ciotomy, or both, explains why the long-term prog-nosis is so good. If the ligament permanentlychanges following fasciotomy and neurectomy withresultant reduced injury risk, there may not be re-current lameness even with complete re-innervationof the proximal suspensory ligament which is possi-ble and even likely post-neurectomy.

Fasciotomy andneurectomy has become a widely accepted treatmentand results in approximately 80% of horses returningto their previous level of work. 6,8To achieve this success rate, it is critical that the preoperative diagno-sis is correct and other lesions that can also improvewith \"suspensory blocks\" are ruled out. The value ofMRI to fully rule out other or additional lesions thatimprove with \"suspensory blocks\" cannot be under-stated. Despite a very low complication rate, whencomplications occur, they can be devastating. 7,8Thus it is important for clinicians to recognize the appropri-ate indications and clearly dened contraindicationsprior to recommending fasciotomy and Clinical Checklist Prior to Recommending Fasciotomy andNeurectomy The lameness or performance problem must improve with diagnostic anesthesia to the sus-pensory ligament region and the imaging ofthe suspensory ligament should match theclinical problem (in severity, for example). There should be absence of signicant injury to other structures that could improve to a sus-pensory ligament block (bone pain from MT3,distal tarsal pain, fetlock joint pain, etc.).

Introduction Horses are exceptional athletes because of a range ofanatomic, functional, and genetic attributes that,coupled with the appropriate training, may result inthe desired level of performance. Poor performancerefers to horses that may train properly but areexperiencing a decrease in performance level orhorses unable to exercise at an expected level basedon their physical characteristics, genetic potential,and training status. The term exercise intoleranceis usually reserved for horses that are more severelyaffected and not capable of training properly, letalone performing at the expected level. A variety ofconditions are associated with poor performance inthe athletic horse. The majority of problems asso-ciated with poor performance involve musculoskele-tal, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases. Asignicant proportion of poorly performing horsesare affected by a combination of problems often in-volving different body systems. This nding under-scores the value of a systematic diagnostic approachto cases of poor performance. In order to understand what factors might nega- tively impact performance, it is important to rstrecognize the physiologic responses to exercise andadaptations occurring with training. The next stepis to appreciate the contribution of the various bodysystems to exercise and how they might impose lim-its on performance based on the type of exercise,tness level, as well as work intensity. In addition,critical assessment of performance using objective orsubjective criteria is an essential aspect of theworkup of poorly performing horses. The discus-sion that follows will be focused on the effect ofpulmonary diseases on the horse's performance.Knowledge of how respiratory diseases cause poorperformance in horses and the value of various di-agnostic tests at detecting these diseases will allowpractitioners to implement targeted therapy andmanagement strategies. 2. Assessment of PerformancePhysiology of Performance in the Horse Athletic performance is dependent on intrinsic fac-tors including physical aptitude, adequate energyproduction, An additional too familiar to horsemen and difcult to assess, isthe mental factor or the will to win. 1Energy re- quired for muscle contraction is produced in twomajor ways: anaerobic metabolism, which requires AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 235IN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSE NOTESglycogen or glucose; and aerobic metabolism, whichrequires oxygen as well as a combustible such asglucose, glycogen, or fatty acids. The source of en-ergy used depends on the intensity of exercise aswell as on its duration. Anaerobic energy produc-tion is very rapid but does not last very long. Aer-obic energy is produced at a slower pace, but yields13 times more adequate energy production and lastsas long as there is a combustible (oxygen, glycogen,fat). It is estimated that Quarter Horses runningquarter-mile races generate about 60% of their en-ergy needs via anaerobic metabolism and the re-mainder via aerobic metabolism. 1In racehorses running a mile, 80% of energy needs are derivedfrom aerobic metabolism. Fat becomes the mainsource of energy during low-intensity exercise suchas endurance racing. Aerobic energy delivery de-pends on pulmonary diffusion of oxygen, hemoglobinconcentration, heart rate, stroke volume, and oxy-gen extraction by muscles. The oxygen transportchain includes oxygen concentration in air (affectedby altitude), oxygen transport via the respiratorytract, oxygen diffusion across alveolar capillary bar-rier, oxygen binding to hemoglobin and distributionto muscle via circulation, and nally, oxygen diffu-sion from capillary to myocyte and mitochondria. There is an integrated adjustment of the various body systems in response to exercise. First of all, ahorse's athleticism is in part due to its large lungand cardiovascular capacity (the lung volume andheart weight of a 1000-lb horse are twice as large asthat of a 1000-lb steer). As the horse starts to exer-cise, there is a rapid increase in ventilation and car-diac output to match the increased oxygen demandfrom exercising muscles. 2At peak exercise, the vol - ume of air inhaled per minute increases 30-fold whilethe heart rate increases approximately 8-fold in com-bination with an increase in stroke volume that resultin cardiac output 10-fold higher than resting values. 2 Greater than 80% of cardiac output flows toward ex-ercising muscles during strenuous exercise. As a re-sult, peak oxygen consumption (VO 2max) is 40-fold higher during strenuous exercise than resting level.As exercise intensity increases, blood lactate concen-tration rises exponentially. Training results in physiological adaptations by a variety of body systems. Bone remodeling in re-sponse to the additional mechanical stresses im-posed by repeated bouts of exercise results instrengthening of bone regions subjected to highestloads. A more readily visible adaptation is the in-crease in muscle mass due to ber hypertrophy ac-companied by increased capillary and mitochondrialdensity. Similarly, cardiovascular remodeling oc-curs with training, causing a rise in heart mass andstroke volume as well as an increase in red-blood-cell mass associated with up to a 15% elevation inhemoglobin concentration. Those adaptations re-sult in a relatively slower heart rate for a givenspeed and up to a 25% increase in VO 2max; however, maximum heart rate during strenuous exercise doesnot change with training.3Unlike other organs, the respiratory tract function does not improve withtraining and vital capacity or maximum minute ven-tilation remain the same in response to exercise. How Do We Dene and Evaluate Performance? In order to determine the cause(s) of poor perfor-mance, it is essential to be in agreement with thehorse's owner or trainer concerning the complaint(e.g., fading in the last quarter mile, abnormal re-spiratory noise, coughing, etc.). This step is essen-tial to selecting appropriate diagnostic tests andassessing therapeutic efcacy. Assessment of per-formance in horses is highly dependent on the typeof athletic activity. In racehorses, performance onthe track may be measured objectively by speed,running time, nishing position, distance behindwinner, and earnings. However, standardizationof measurements is difcult because a large numberof horse-related factors (sex, age, horse quality, t-ness level, etc.) and other factors unrelated to horses(trainer, jockey, distance, purse, weight carried,track conditions, environmental conditions, etc.)may vary between races and confound results.Sophisticated statistical analyses are required tocontrol for the effects of confounders on performanceoutcomes. 4Control of confounding factors are more feasible when horses are running on a high-speed treadmill; however, most studies suffer fromlow sample size and statistical power. Also, therelevance of performance data obtained duringtreadmill studies to track performance during rac-ing has not been established for all disciplines. 5,6 In competitive sports other than racing and in plea-sure horses, measurement of performance is moresubjective and difcult to assess. An owner ortrainer's complaint of poor performance may be dueto the horse coughing while being ridden, to a per-ceived decrease in willingness to perform, because ofincreased respiratory efforts during exercise, or pro-longed recovery period following exercise. In suchcases, assessment of performance has been con-ducted by asking owners or trainers to rate perfor-mance using semiquantitative systems such asvisual analog scales or performance scores. 7-9 Alternatively, performance may be evaluated by measuring physiological parameters collected dur-ing eld or treadmill testing with portable equip-ment that now allows simultaneous recording ofheart rate and velocity data, measurement of lactateconcentration using point-of-care units, and over-ground endoscopy and measurement of respiratorygases using portable systems. 10-12Evaluation of physiologic parameters may be conducted in twoways: 1) by evaluating data from a poorly perform-ing horse against those from a database generatedfrom comparable horses using a predetermined pro-tocol; 2) by comparing parameters collected longitu-dinally on the same horse. The most challengingcases are horses that have not competed yet (\"un-proven\") and that are not performing up to the ex- 236 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSEpectation of the owner or trainer. In such cases, itis important to follow a protocol that allows system-atic evaluation of all relevant body systems in orderto rule out known causes of poor performance.In the end, the absence of evidence explaining why ahorse is not performing will suggest one of threepossibilities: 1) a behavior/psychological problem,2) limited ability, or 3) undiagnosed pathology. Poor performance can result from a variety of causes besides respiratory diseases. More impor-tantly, it is common to diagnose several problems inthe same horse. 5,6This is why it is important to perform a comprehensive evaluation of poorly per-forming horses. 3. Pathophysiology of Poor Performance Healthy and t racehorses experience markedexercise-induced arterial hypoxemia and hyper-capnia during exercise is estimated that 75% of exercise- induced hypoxemia is due to diffusion limitation and25% secondary to insufcient ventilation relative tometabolic needs. Therefore, respiratory function isthe main constraining factor to performance in tand sound horses competing in short-duration, high-intensity exercise (Quarter Horse, Thoroughbred,Standardbred racehorses). In this context, even amild degree of airway obstruction or pulmonary dis-ease may further compromise oxygen delivery totissues and potentially lead to decreased perfor-mance. 14-16For horses exercising from moderate (50-80% VO2max, e.g., - ance) to low intensity ( /H1102150% VO2max, e.g., Western pleasure, trail riding), the effect of respiratory dis-ease on oxygen delivery and performance is depen-dent on the severity of the condition in relation tooxygen demand. Fatigue results from insufcientoxygen delivery and failure to produce sufcient en-ergy for exercising muscles. Blood lactate concentration rises exponentially with running speed and this relationship is affected bytraining. Velocity corresponding to a blood lactate of4 mmol/l (VLa4) is the tness level (\"anaerobic threshold\") andperformance ability in race sports 17,18 Lactate is a by-product of anaerobic metabolism thatrises in blood as energy demand increases with exer-cise intensity while oxygen delivery plateaus. Whenoxygen delivery is further compromised by respiratorydisease, blood lactate levels increase faster resulting ina lower VLa4; however, other causes of decreased per-formance such as lameness or cardiac diseases mayalso be associated with lower VLa4 values. 12 4. Effect of Pulmonary Disease on AthleticPerformanceInflammatory Airway Disease (Mild-Moderate EquineAsthma) Horses with inflammatory airway disease (IAD)usually have a history of cough, increased airwaymucus, and decreased performance or delayed recov-ery after exercise. Scoring of tracheal mucus inhorses with chronic airway inflammation has beenvalidated. 19There is a strong association between poor performance and mucus accumulation in thetrachea, both in racehorses and sports horses. 8,20,21 Detection of more than a few blobs of mucus (i.e.,score /H110221) in the trachea after a race is associated with higher race placing in both Standardbreds andThoroughbreds. 20,21More pronounced accumula - tion of mucus that forms a continuous stream in thetrachea (score /H110222) has been associated with poor willingness to perform as assessed by riders ofhorses competing in dressage and show-jumping. 8 Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cytology al- including neutrophilia, eosinophilia, andmastocytosis. 22Neutrophilic airway inflammation (/H110225%) has been associated with poor performance inThoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses as ( /H110221%) hyperresponsiveness has been reported in some poorly performing racehorses.26 In a recent prospective study in Thoroughbred race-horses, we found a signicant negative correlationbetween performance and BALF neutrophils andmast cells (unpublished data). In racehorses, tracheal wash fluid neutrophilia has been associated with coughing; 27however, there is no association with performance.28,29Similarly, there is no correlation between tracheal wash andBALF cytology. Recurrent Airway Obstruction (Severe Equine Asthma) Recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) or heaves is anallergic disease characterized by frequent cough,excess mucopurulent secretions in the tracheobron-chial tree, abnormal respiratory sounds, and in-creased respiratory efforts. Exercise intolerance isusually marked but highly dependent on the level ofexertion required of the horse as well as severity ofairway obstruction. Horses with mild respiratorysigns at rest may show abnormally increased respira-tory efforts for a given level of exercise or exhibit pro-longed recovery post-exercise. Because of a lack of\"normal\" cardiopulmonary variables during exerciseand recovery period in healthy sports/pleasure horses,most of the assessment concerning exercise intoler-ance is based on owner or trainer's perception. Cytologic evaluation of BALF from RAO-affected horse reveal marked neutrophilia /H9262L). Similarly, tracheal an increased neutrophil percentage ( /H1102250%). Horses during an acute exacerbation of the dis- ease exhibit abnormal gas exchanges at rest leadingto hypoxemia and sometimes hypercapnia. 30,31 These blood gas abnormalities are mainly the resultof ventilation-perfusion mismatch and increaseddead-space ventilation. Horses with mild clinicalsigns usually have normal blood gases. During ex- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 237IN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSEercise, the degree of exercise-induced hypoxemiaand hypercapnia is markedly worse in RAO horsesin crisis compared with when they are in remis-sion. 32Deterioration in gas exchanges appears to be mainly due to further deterioration in ventilation-perfusion relationship and is associated with exer-cise intolerance. Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Hemorrhage The blood may be either seen directly at the nose(epistaxis) or within the tracheobronchial airwaysby endoscopy. Alternatively, pulmonary hemor-rhage may be inferred from the presence of hemo-siderophages or excess red blood cells in trachealwash or bronchoalveolar fluid. The in the pul-monary capillary circulation during strenuous exer-cise resulting in extravasation of red blood cells into the alveoli. 33Strenuous exercise is also associated with large swings in alveolar pressure. Subatmo-spheric pressure in alveoli during each inspirationadds to capillary blood pressure to generate hightransmural pressures. In chronic bleeders, pulmo-nary vein remodeling and wall thickening in combi-nation with high pulmonary artery pressure likelycontribute to more extensive pulmonary capillaryruptures. 34 Based on results from a recent systematic review, high-quality studies conducted during regular rac-ing meets have shown that EIPH is associated withworse nishing (inferior position and farther behindwinner) and lower race earnings (moderate-qualityevidence). 35Lower-quality studies failed to dem - onstrate an effect of EIPH on performance. Thereis some evidence of a dose-response relationship be-tween EIPH and performance; that is to say, moresevere EIPH is associated with worse performance.There is no doubt that severe (Grade 4) EIPH nega- tively affects performance in racehorses. However,the effect of the more common mild or moderateEIPH (Grade 1-3) on performance has been morevariable. Depending on the study, EIPH of at leastGrade 1 or at least Grade 2 severity is associatedwith decreased performance in Thoroughbred race-horses. 36,37However, EIPH severity is not associ - ated with decreased performance in barrel racers; infact, horses with Grade 4 bleeding were signicantlyfaster than horses with lower grades in one study. 38 While the prevalence of EIPH is high based on cross-sectional studies in racehorses, the number of bleed-ing episodes visible by endoscopy in a given horse isrelatively small compared to number of starts ( /H110113o f 15 endoscopies). 39Racing career duration is simi - lar among horses with no EIPH detected by endos-copy or horses with Grades 1-3; however, horseswith Grade 4 are more likely to have shorter ca-reers. 40Some studies have shown that horses exhibiting EIPH experience a more severe exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia than horses withoutEIPH. 14-15This mechanism may explain neg - ative impact of EIPH on performance.

This sectiondescribes the clinical signs and ancillary tests performed to diagnose noninfectious lung pathologiesaffecting athletic horses. Standardized techniques currently or under development to diagnoseinflammatory airway disease (IAD) and exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage Author's horses' lower air-ways have a dramatic effect on their athletic capac-ity and usually present with obvious clinical signsthat are not often representing a diagnostic chal-lenge. To the contrary, noninfectious lower airwaypathologies can induce subtle clinical signs and aremore challenging to diagnose by practitioners. This section will therefore not describe diagnostictechniques used for infectious lung diseases but willrather focus on noninfectious lower airway patholo-gies of the performance horses. Pathologies that impede airflow along the airway tract (from the nostrils down to the alveoli) willaffect the horses' athletic capacity. Horses have alarge lung capacity, with minute ventilation greaterthan 1850 L/min 1described in trained Thorough- breds during maximum exercise. Therefore, theycan easily compensate for mild-to-moderate impair-ment of their lung function when not exercised atmaximal capacity. This explains why clinical signscan be subtle and pathologies can be unnoticed if thehorses are trained in a submaximal or limited aer-obic type of exercise. This was also reflected in astudy by a very high owner satisfaction with theclinical status of their horses although they wereaffected by recurrent airway obstruction (RAO). 2 The objectives of this article are 1) to describe clinical signs that can be associated with pulmonarydisease in athletic horses and warrant further an-cillary testing, 2) describe the endoscopic and imag-ing techniques used in these horses, 3) describeairways sampling technique and interpretation ofthe results, and 4) describe the lung function testsavailable for diagnosing pulmonary diseases in theathletic horse. Clinical Signs Warranting Diagnostic Testing forRespiratory Diseases It is important for the clinicians to know the infor-mation on the clinical signs associated with lungpathologies of the athletic horse because they allowgathering the most relevant information from theowners to increase the accuracy of a diagnostic plan.Clinical signs can be subtle but they usually have a 240 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSE NOTESgood sensitivity to detect respiratory problems inathletic horses. Cough Cough has been strongly associated with pulmonaryinflammation. 3,4It is a sensitive, but not specic, indicator of lower airways inflammation when suf-cient observation time is allowed to monitor forcoughing; because of the intermittent nature of thecoughing, an observation time of at least 1 hour isrecommended to increase the sensitivity of coughdetection. 4This long observation time also ex - plains why coughing is detected more reliably byhorse owners than by the treating veterinarians.Coughing can be reported as a number of coughs perhour or more generally as a categorical scale like nocough/occasional cough/frequent cough, 2,4or by ask - ing the owner to quantify it using a \"visual analogscale.\" 5,6Coughing has been shown to be associ - ated with the presence of mucus in the trachea, aswell as with pulmonary neutrophilic inflamma-tion. 3,4,7Severe coughing has been shown to be associated with abnormal lung auscultation, laboredbreathing at rest, and decreased blood oxygenationin a controlled study on RAO horses. 2 Nasal Discharge/Mucus Mucus can be seen at the nostrils at rest, after exercise, or within the upper and lower airwaysduring an endoscopic examination. Tracheal mu-cus scoring and association with lung inflammationis described below. Nasal discharge has been re-ported by owners with a high prevalence in horseswith lung inflammation 7and with RAO.2Nasal discharge is often described as present/absent, butquantifying nasal discharge objectively is challeng-ing. To our knowledge, only one study described aclinical nostril mucus score but it needs further val-idation before it can be used in an objective mannerreliably. 8Horses with RAO that are reported by owners to have nasal discharge are more likely tohave labored breathing at rest but were not cough-ing more than control horses, 2suggesting that cough and nasal discharge should be taken into accountindependently in the clinical assessment of horses. Decreased Performance A decrease in performance can be difcult to docu-ment reliably, notably because of the complexity ofthe variables involved. Optimal performance in-volves not only athletic and respiratory capacity, butdepending on the disciplines, animal's skills canplay a major role in the performance outcome. Measurements of performance are more often de-scribed in racing horses, with the analysis of vari-ables like earnings, ranking, and number of starts,for example. Fitness and athletic capacity criteriaare presented in the previous article (by Dr. L.Cou\u00ebtil) of this in-depth series. Performance hasbeen shown to be negatively affected in racehorsesby exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH),as well as by inflammatory airway diseases (IADs).Willingness to perform is also affected in show jump-ers and dressage horses affected with tracheal mu-cus accumulation. 9Decreased performance is one of the parameters included in the denition of theIAD phenotype. 10 Labored Breathing at Rest Labored breathing at rest is not specic of respiratorydisease, but it is by denition a hallmark clinical signof severe equine asthma (RAO). 11Typically, horses with heaves will have a short inspiration but a pro-longed biphasic expiration with an active abdominallift, which can lead to hypertrophy of the abdominaloblique muscle (\"heaves line\"). 12 Clinical Scores and Questionnaires Some studies have used clinical questionnaires andperformed association analysis based on the an-swers obtained from the owners. 7,13,14These ques - tionnaires have been validated for the diagnosis ofsevere lung inflammation in RAO horses, but lacksensitivity and specicity for the detection of lowergrade inflammation and IAD. 7The questionnaires give a total score for the horses based on the pres-ence of respiratory clinical signs. Given that ath- letic horses present usually with more subtle clinicalsigns, the questionnaires are unlikely to be sensitiveenough to detect respiratory problems in this population. Based on the clinical signs and history, the clini- cians can shortlist some working diagnoses andmake a diagnostic plan. An interesting approach todecide on the choice of the most appropriate test andto interpret the results toward a diagnosis is thelikelihood ratios (LR) and Bayes' theorem. 15Using this approach, after providing a pre-test probabilityof disease, clinicians can easily calculate a post-testprobability at the animal level without taking intoaccount the prevalence of the disease. The inter-pretation of test results using the LRs method is notaffected by the prevalence of the disease, like itwould be with the traditional approach using thepositive or negative predictive values. The LR method is however based on the availability of thesensitivity and specicity of the ancillary diagnostictest to diagnose a respiratory pathology, as well ason the clinician's experience to estimate a pre-testprobability of a horse having a pathology. Unfor-tunately, few studies have investigated the sensitiv-ity and specicity of ancillary tests to diagnoserespiratory diseases in horses. The choice of testsand interpretation of results is therefore mainlybased on clinical experience. 2. Imaging Techniques to Diagnose PulmonaryDiseases in Athletic HorsesEndoscopy This section describes the information available onthe endoscopy of the trachea and lower airways.The upper laryngeal) en- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 241IN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSEdoscopy and scoring systems are outside the scope ofthis article. With the availability of more portableand affordable videoendoscopic equipment, it hasbecome routine to perform endoscopy the horses'airways.IndicationsEndoscopy of the trachea, tracheal septum, and bronchi provides valuable information in perfor-mance horses on the degree of mucus accumulation,inflammation, and to identify pulmonary bleeding.Lower-airway endoscopy is a sensitive test for detec-tion of inflammation in the lower airway tract andspecic scoring systems have been validated. Lower- airway endoscopy with scoring of the tracheobron-chial blood has also been validated to assess theseverity of EIPH. 16 EquipmentExamination of the trachea can be performed with a1.1-m-long endoscope, but the scoring and examina-tion of main bronchi re-quires a 1.25-1.4-m-long endoscope. can also be used to visualize highergeneration bronchi and to perform a bronchoalveo-lar lavage (BAL; see the paragraph below).ProcedureSedation is often not necessary when a 1.2-m endo-scope is used for a brief examination of the lowerairways. Coughing during the endoscopy proce-dure is to be expected in horses with airway mucusaccumulation or inflammation. Neuroleptanalgesiawith butorphanol and local anesthesia with lidocaineinstillation can be used to help prevent coughing andminimize patient discomfort.Lower-Airways NomenclatureFindings in the trachea and in the area of the tra-cheal septum are straightforward to describe ana-tomically, but a two-digit nomenclature system isoften used to label the bronchi in the horse. Be-cause horses' lung branches monopodially withsmaller daughter bronchi branching from a mainlarger parent bronchus, the rst nomenclature digitindicates the main bronchus (right, 1; left, 2) and thesecond digit indicates the secondary bronchus bifur-cation location (for example, 1.3 refers to the thirdsecondary bronchus in the right lung main bronchus).Scoring of Mucus, Inflammation, and BloodFindingsEndoscopic scoring systems are quantifytracheal score has been well validated usinga 0 to 5 scale system. A score 0 represents absenceof tracheal mucus, 1 is for multiple small blobs, 2 forlarger blobs, 3 for confluent/stream-forming, 4 forpool-forming, and 5 for profuse amount of mucus. 17A similar scoring system has also been used forbronchial mucus scoring. 18 Assessment of lower-airways mucus is not only for reporting purposes but has many practical clinicalimplications. Indeed, a mucus score /H113502 is associ- ated with poor performance in Thoroughbred race-horses. 19Mucus accumulation can be secondary to inflammatory processes in the lungs, as well as aresponse to airborne dust. 20In addition, the pres - ence of mucus the BAL. 17,18 Tracheal septum thickness at the level of the carina is not correlated with, and is not as clinicallysignicant as, the tracheal mucus score. A greatertracheal septum thickness score is however consistentwith a higher bronchial mucus score and is increasedin horses with severe lung inflammation. 18 The presence of blood in the lower airways is considered diagnostic of EIPH. Tracheal endos-copy has a high specicity for EIPH, but it is in theauthor's opinion highly dependent on the timing ofthe examination after exercise. It is generally rec-ommended to perform a tracheal endoscopy 30 to 90minutes after exercise to decrease the risk of obtain-ing false-negative results. Quantication of thetracheal blood has been proposed using a validatedscoring system that uses a 0-4 grading scale. Agrade 0 represents absence of blood, 1 is for at leastone fleck of blood or short narrow streams of blood, 2for one long stream of blood or more than two shortstreams occupying more than one third of the tra-cheal circumference, 3 for streams covering morethan one third of tracheal circumference with nopooling, 4 for coalescing streams covering more than90% of the tracheal surface with blood pooling. 16 The correlation between tracheal blood grade andthe amount of lung bleeding has yet to be estab-lished, but EIPH has been reported with a highprevalence in Thoroughbred and Standardbred race-horses as well as barrel racing horses. 21-24 Thoracic Ultrasonography The lung is an air-lled organ and it may thereforeseem at rst that ultrasonography may not be thebest diagnostic tool for performing a pulmonary ex-amination. However, ultrasonography is diagnos-tically valuable and more sensitive than chestradiography for detecting pathologies affecting thelung periphery by identifying some lack of ventila-tion in the affected lung areas (shown by a breach inthe normal reverberation artefact at the lung sur-face). The technique is simple and relatively quickto perform, does not require sedation and can also beperformed without clipping the horse in most of thecases. The performance of the ultrasound equipment is continuously improving, now allowing identicationof very minor lesions and therefore increasing the sen-sitivity of the technique. Caution should however beused to avoid over-interpretation of ultrasonographyndings. 242 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PULMONARY ATHLETIC HORSEUltrasonography can sensitively detect lung atel- ectasis or consolidation in the lung periphery. Tho-racic ultrasonography can also reveal nonspecicabnormalities like pleural roughening and \"comettail\" artifacts (also called B lines) but their severityremains a subjective assessment. M-mode ultra- sonography can also be used to detect pneumothorax. In racehorses, detection of the \"comet tail\" arti- facts is a highly sensitive (89%), but not specic(26%) indicator of EIPH. 25 Altogether it is the author's opinion that the tho- racic ultrasonography is better suited for assessinginfectious lung pathologies in athletic horses. Lastly, recent developments in technology now allow performing endobronchial ultrasonography inhorses, using a probe that is passed through thechannel of an endoscope. 26This technique has been shown to reliably assess airway smooth musclemass in the main bronchi of horses and could beused to monitor airway remodeling and long-termresponse to therapy. Radiography Technique and EquipmentIn practice, lung radiography is challenging to per-form and interpret in horses because of the size ofthe animal. The distance between the horse bodysurface and the screen augments magnication andgeometric distortion while decreasing image resolu-tion. Four ventral caudalprojections and dorsal and ventral cranial projec-tions) should be used to evaluate the entire lungeld in adult horses. Alignment of the generatorwith the cassette and the optional use of a grid makethis technique extremely difcult to perform in gen-eral practice. The generator should be xed andcapable of /H11022100 kVp and 30mAs. Exposure time should be kept as brief as possible. Exposureshould be taken at the end of inspiration to decreasethe degree of interstitial pattern.InterpretationAge, size, and respiratory phase should be takeninto consideration when interpreting equine lungradiographs. Of and interstitial patternssuggest less severe of a pathology than does an al-veolar pattern, and the latter is therefore not com-monly seen in noninfectious lung diseases of athletichorses. Radiographic patterns correlate poorlywith histologic lesions, and the localization of theabnormal patterns in the lung eld is important.For example, interstitial lesions, and pulmonaryedema are more commonly caudodorsal or diffuse. A mild bronchointerstitial pattern should be in- terpreted with caution because it can usually befound in healthy racehorses and may be a result ofsubclinical peribronchial brosis. 27In racehorses with pulmonary abscesses, lung radiography cou-pled with assessment of blood parameters and otherancillary diagnostic tests can be used to predictprognosis for a return to performance. 28 Lung radiography has a poor sensitivity in detecting EIPH as many horses with EIPH have no radiographiclesions or have a nonspecic mild caudodorsal bron-chial or interstitial patterns. Radiography may havesome value in identifying severe cases of EIPH. Some of the most chronic and severe RAO cases may have radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis,but in the case of athletic horses, thoracic radio-graphs are more often used to rule out pneumoniaand are of limited benet to diagnose nonseptic dif-fuse inflammatory lung diseases. 27 Scintigraphy Nuclear scintigraphy has been used in researchenvironments to study ventilation and ventilation- perfusion matching, as well as to study the efciencyof nebulizers. 29-31Nuclear scintigraphy has also been used to detect EIPH in racehorses and providesphysiological information about the perfusion andventilation of the caudal aspect of the lung in thesehorses. 32These techniques are not used routinely in practice and require safe collection of the aerosol-ized radioisotopes. 3. Sampling Techniques to Diagnose PulmonaryDiseases in Athletic Horses Techniques used mainly for microbiology culturepurposes are not specically described here. Sampling Tracheal Fluid for Cytology Tracheal fluid cytology for the diagnosis of noninfec-tious inflammatory lung diseases is controversial.The cellular composition of airway secretions differsbetween the peripheral lower airways and the tra-chea and the true bronchiolar cytology is better rep-resented in a BAL sample than in the tracheal washfluid. Tracheal fluid is better suited for bacterialculture when pneumonia is suspected and a studyfound that almost ve times as many positive cul-tures were obtained from tracheal fluid samples aswere obtained from bronchial fluid. 33The distinc - tion between an infectious and a noninfectious con-dition can be difcult, and the developments inmicrobiome analysis may provide more informationin the future about the relationship between lowerairways microorganisms and inflammation. The consensus denition of IAD and RAO is based on the use of BAL cytology to diagnose lung inflam-mation. 10,11In practice, however, tracheal fluid cy - tology is still commonly used in racehorses when theBAL cannot be performed for practical reasons.Tracheal fluid is usually collected by aspiration us-ing a catheter passed through the working channelof an endoscope when performing a tracheal endos-copy in racehorses. It is recommended that thetracheal sample be collected after the horse has ex-ercised to increase the chances of detecting airwayinflammation or EIPH. tracheal fluid cytol- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H114082017 243IN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSEogy can be challenging for the clinical pathologistbecause the cells from these samples can be quitedegenerated and embedded in mucus. Sampling Bronchoalveolar Fluid for Cytology BAL is performed when the aim is to assess cellu-larity of the peripheral lower airways of the lungand is indicated for evaluating diffuse pathologiesinvolving the small airways. A study revealing agood correlation between BAL cytology and lunghistology 34support the use of the BAL in that sense. However, others found some signicant differencebetween BAL sampled in the right or left lung. 35 The BAL is a sensitive and reliable technique fordetecting lung inflammation but attention needs tobe paid to details like the volume of fluid infusedduring the procedure and the staining and countingtechniques used at the laboratory.TechniqueThe BAL can be performed in the eld using a longtube (BAL tubes with a cuff at the tip) or under endoscopic guidance (ideally with a 2-3-m long endoscope). The key to the success of the procedureis to avoid coughing from the horse, as it compro-mises the wedge of the tube with the bronchus andaffects dramatically the amount of fluid collected.To achieve this, a good neuroleptanalgesia is re-quired (the author uses 10 mg of butorphanol com-bined with an alpha-2 agonist) and local anesthesiaof the airways is also used (lidocaine diluted to0.5%). The tube or endoscope progresses in the air-ways and usually is wedged in the caudo-dorsal lungarea because of the monopodial anatomy of the bron-chial tree in horses. There is a consensus that theBAL technique should use at least 250 mL of sterilesaline for reliable results, 10and many research studies use two consecutive lavages. The fluid canbe aspirated back with 60-mL syringes and trans-ferred to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)tubes and shipped to the laboratory with icepacks.It is important to submit samples to a laboratorywith experience in BAL cytological analysis becauseof the particular cell staining and countingrequirements.InterpretationThe staining should allow blue staining tech - nique can be used to identify hemosiderin morespecically. The most reliable cell counting technique for the BAL differential analysis counts cells in ve micro-scopic elds at 500 /H11003total magnication (50 /H11003objective and 10/H11003 eyepiece) on slides with high cell density. 37 The accepted reference values for the differential cell count in BAL fluid from healthy horses sampledwith/H11022250 mL of saline are 10 Depending on the horse populations and BAL vol- ume infused, the neutrophils can often be foundbetween 5% and 10% in horses that are deemedhealthy. 7Horses with RAO have a moderate-to- severe BAL fluid neutrophilia, typically /H1102225% and sometimes as high as /H1102280%. Horses with IAD typ- ically have a mild-to-moderate increase in neutro-phil percentage, combined or not with an increase inmast cells and/or eosinophil percentage. It is com-mon to also nd giant cells, mucus, intracellularorganic, and mineral particulates in the BAL frompatients with lung inflammation. Before a diagno-sis is made, it is very important to interpret withcaution, and in light of clinical signs, a BAL cytolog-ical analysis revealing an increased percentage ofinflammatory cells. The BAL is also a reference technique to diagnose EIPH as it is more sensitive than the tracheal en-doscopy and can detect red blood cells when no signof bleeding is observed upon tracheal endoscopy. 38 Quantication of the severity of the EIPH episode bycounting red blood cells in the BAL is not standard-ized yet. A benet of the BAL technique for EIPHis that it provides information on the recent historyof EIPH in horses by looking at the cell population ofhemosiderophages. Indeed, the fact that the hemo-siderophage count in BAL fluid remains high for 3weeks after an episode of bleeding in mild EIPH canbe used for clinical interpretation and managementof these horses. 38 Lung Biopsy The lung biopsy is a reference test for noninfectiouslung pathologies and can be performed using a trans-thoracic approach. A spring-loaded automated nee- dle system is recommended over a tru-cut system. 39 This technique provides excellent quality samplesof small size for diffuse pathologies that affectperipheral lungs, but it presents risks to inducelung hemorrhage and pneumothorax. 39The proce - dure should be performed in a hospital environmentwhere critical care monitoring and blood transfusionare available. Another technique uses the endo-bronchial approach with forceps to take a deep pieceof bronchial epithelium at various carinae underendoscopic guidance. 40,41This method is safer but provides even smaller and more supercial tissuesamples than the transthoracic biopsy technique.It is used mainly for research purposes to quantifytissue expression of RNA and protein or to measuresmooth muscle mass with morphometric analysis. 4. Lung Function Tests to Diagnose PulmonaryDiseases in Athletic Horses This section briefly describes tests that are mostlyavailable in a research environment. The most re-cent development in this area are the studies usingVO 2max measurements in the eld. 244 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSELung Mechanics and Bronchoprovocation Tests These techniques allow measuring the mechanicalproperties of the lungs, including the degree of re-sistance to airflow generally induced by a narrowingof the lower conducting airways. These techniquestypically require the use of a facemask with a flow-meter and an esophageal balloon to measure pleuralpressure. These techniques measuring standard lung mechanics at rest have been used extensively inequine research to assess the efcacy of varioustreatments for RAO where the bronchoconstrictionis severe, but they are not sensitive enough to detectmild airway obstruction. Other techniques such asforced oscillation, impulse oscillometry, forced expi-ration, and volumetric capnography were adaptedfrom human medicine to increase the sensitivity ofdetection of lung disease; however, these proceduresmay lack specicity and can be difcult to performand interpret. Bronchoprovocation tests are usedin horses suspected of having IAD, where the lungfunction is suspected to be abnormal despite theabsence of clinical signs of labored breathing at rest.Horses with IAD will show marked bronchoconstric-tion at low histamine or methacholine concentra-tions, but these tests are also difcult to interpretand are not commonly performed in practice. VO2max Tests Given that a small decrease in lung capacity has adramatic effect in oxygen consumption during max-imal intensity of exercise, measuring VO 2max may be a good way to detect early pathologies affectingthe lungs of horse athletes. A decrease in VO 2max is however not specic of a lung pathology (as it canbe affected by cardiovascular and lameness conditions)and requires a high-speed treadmill and specic flow- meters gas analyzers. Portable prototypes ofequipment allowing measuring VO 2max in eld con - ditions have, however, recently been tested and maybe promising in the near future to test the lungfunction of exercising horses. 5. Monitoring Response to Therapy After a lung inflammatory pathology is diagnosedand recommendations are provided to the caretak-ers, it is useful to establish a plan for reassessmentand monitoring of the condition. Obviously, clini-cal signs like coughing or the level of performancecan be assessed by the owner, but other advancedtests are also available. The BAL provides somepertinent information about the status of the lunginflammation when management changes have beenput in place. However, and interestingly, manystudies found that the BAL cytology still shows anaccumulation of inflammatory cells if the horses aretreated with corticosteroids but without change inthe air quality, whereas there is an improvement inthe BAL cytology when the management is address-ing environmental dust. 42-45The author will usu - ally not repeat a BAL analysis for monitoring if atreatment plan has not been in place for at least 6weeks. A bronchoprovocation test can be repeated for monitoring the respiratory condition if the tech-nique is available; corticosteroid therapy will de-crease airway hypersensitivity and hyperreactivityin 1 to 2 weeks after the treatment is initiated. 8 In cases where the bronchoconstriction is severe and is recurrent like in horses with severe asthma,the airway remodeling is a concern because it couldprevent a return to normal lung function despite asound therapeutic plan. The reversibility of thebronchoconstriction can then be assessed by induc-ing a maximal short-duration bronchodilation andobserving (or measuring) the improvement in re-spiratory function (corresponding to a decreasein lung resistance). Given that anticholinergicagents are more potent than /H9252-adrenergic drugs to induce maximal bronchodilation in RAO, atropine,orN-Butylscopalammonium be injected intravenously while the horse's respiratory mechanicsare recorded (or the effort of breathing is ob-served). 46,47Atropine has more adverse effects (tachycardia, mucosal dryness, colic, and excita-tion) than N-Butylscopalammonium bromide. 47 Clinical signs are often not reliable to monitor EIPH. Therefore, frequent assessment with tra-cheal endoscopy (30 to 90 minutes post racing) or aBAL cytology performed within a few days of racingare useful to detect episodes of EIPH. 6. Conclusion Diagnosing pulmonary pathologies in athletichorses can be challenging and should start with agood documentation of the clinical signs. The in-terpretation of the ancillary tests can be difcult if agood technique and scoring systems are not usedproperly. In addition, athletic horses may have sev-eral pathologic conditions affecting different body sys-tems altogether that add a level of complexity to thediagnostic plan. Although not discussed here, upper-and lower-airway pathologies are not uncommonlyfound together in the same horse, which will affect thetherapeutic strategy.

Introduction In considering both pharmaceutical therapy andmanagement of equine asthma, it is important toestablish reasonable goals for treatment. Al-though the goals in treating equine asthma aresimilar for both the recurrent airway obstruction(RAO) and inflammatory airway disease (IAD)subset, there are important differences in the rea-sonable expectation that the owner should havefor return to athletic function. The goals for RAO should include: 1) immediate relief of the bronchos-pasm that causes cough and excessive respiratory ef-fort, 2) reduction of lower airway inflammation, 3)long-term prevention of episodes of heaves by controlof lower airway inflammation and airway obstruction,and 4) return to limited or even full athletic potential.The goals for treatment of IAD are similar: 1) elimi-nate cough and bronchoconstriction that impair per- formance, 2) reduce mucus production and airwayplugging, 3) reduce airway reactivity, and 4) preventrecurrences. General Approach: There must be a treatment strategy with recognizable and achievable goals inplace that is approved by both the attending veter-inarian and the owner or trainer in order for RAO orIAD to be treated successfully. Treatment of thesediseases entails a team approach and an acceptancethat this may be a life-long problem that may bemodied, but that is unlikely to go away. One ofthe most important aspects to successful treatmentis establishment of a reasonable denition of returnto athletic use. It is entirely reasonable to expect that a young racehorse would be able to return toracing after a short, targeted period of treatment.The owner of the older horse with heaves, how-ever, must recognize that a much more modest return to light pleasure riding is a reasonable goal.The use of lung-function testing to assess responseto bronchodilator therapy can be very useful in iden-tifying horses that are less likely to respond totherapy. Although it is important to assess the horse's immediate clinical presentation, it is equally im-portant for both RAO and IAD to take an in-depthhistory to try to document environmental triggers.A very thorough inspection and assessment of thehorse's environment is also critical to develop aplan to achieve environmental remediation. Forinstance, if the history suggests that the horse isconsistently worse in the spring, whereas clinicalsigns are abated in the barn in the winter, itsuggests that the worst culprits for this horse arethe molds and pollens associated with moist warmweather, and the clinician may prescribe cleanindoor living for the horse during that period.It is very useful for the owner or trainer to keep a 248 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSE NOTESdiary for the affected horse, noting when exacer-bations occur. There is good evidence for the use of glucocorti- coids and bronchodilators in heaves, and thisknowledge has been extrapolated to the treatmentof IAD. For both, the mainstay of treatment hasbecome a combination of environmental remedia-tion, corticosteroid therapy, and bronchodilators.In horses with RAO, there is evidence that thecombination of these three approaches will givethe best outcome. 1-3 2. Long-Term Control\u2014Corticosteroid Therapy Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of successfultreatment for both IAD and RAO. Inflammation un-derlies remodeling of the airways with accompanyingairway hyper-reactivity, and consequent coughing andexpiratory dyspnea. Bronchodilator acute, debilitating bronchospasm, but onlyconsistent anti-inflammatory therapy, in conjunctionwith avoidance of environmental triggers, will breakthe vicious cycle of inflammation, airway hyper-reactivity, and bronchoconstriction. The anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids in both RAOand IAD is impressive. Corticosteroids activateglucocorticoid receptors, thus putting into motiona profound inhibition of the arachidonic acid cas-cade and limiting production of leukotrienes andother inflammatory molecules. Response to ste-roids can vary considerably from horse to horse.A very important caveat, however, is that usingcorticosteroids without remediating the environ-ment (see below) is like using hand sanitizer with-out washing your hands\u2014better than nothing, butmuch less effective than removing the actual prob-lem. In a study of stabled horses with heaves,treatment with dexamethasone failed to make asignicant positive difference to the airway neu-trophil counts in a subset of horses, indicatingthat corticosteroids cannot overcome environmen-tal insult in all horses with RAO. 2Moreover, a study found that although long-term corticoste-roid treatment decreased airway smooth muscle inhorses with RAO, airway neutrophilia persistedwhen horses were kept indoors. 1 Corticosteroids can be administered both system- ically and via aerosolized delivery. Depending onthe severity of disease, initial treatment may besystemic or a combination of systemic and aerosol-ized delivery and more chronic treatment may beaerosolized. The decision as to which deliverymethod is preferable may be influenced by a numberof factors, including nancial, given that aerosolizeddrugs and their delivery devices are quite expensive,as well as known and putative side effects. It isimportant to remember that corticosteroids can,among other things, adversely affect tissue growthand protein use, impair the barrier function of theintestinal mucosa, cause immune suppression, andsuppress adrenal function.Systemic Corticosteroids Multiple studies have demonstrated the positive ef-fects of corticosteroid drugs on horses with heaves,but the evidence for their use in IAD, despite goodclinical response anecdotally, is less robust. Pred-nisolone and dexamethasone are the corticosteroidsused most frequently in the treatment of RAO andIAD. Triamcinolone acetonide has also been shownto relieve airway obstruction in heaves. 4Triamcin - olone, however, is anecdotally more closely associ-ated with the development of laminitis in horses,than other corticosteroids. A recent study hasshown profound and persistent hyperglycemia andhypertriglycerridemia (3-4 days) in horses after asingle injection of triamcinolone, which may explainthe anecdotal reports. 5Thus, its use is discouraged in the treatment of noninfectious inflammatory air-way diseases. Prednisone was also frequently usedin the past, but studies have shown therapeuticfailures in heaves likely due to the horse's inabilityto absorb prednisone after oral administration. 6 In a study looking at heaves-affected horses treatedwith either oral prednisolone (1.0 (0.1 mg/kg bwt) in conjunction withenvironmental control, both drugs had similar positiveeffects on the clinical signs of heaves, endoscopicscores, and blood gases. However, dexamethasonehad a more benecial effect on bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL) cytology. pred - (2.0 mg/kg bwt, PO, once per day) and dexa-methasone (0.05 mg/kg bwt, PO, once per day)improved pulmonary function, despite continuous an-tigen exposure. However, in that study oral dexa-methasone was more effective than oral prednisolonein improving lung function in horses with heaves. 8 A study also showed that horses suffering from heavesthat were treated for 14 days with either isoflupredoneacetate (0.03 mg/kg bwt, IM, once a day) or dexameth-asone (0.04 mg/kg bwt, IV, once a day) all showedimprovements in lung function, although BAL fluidsamples were not assessed. Isoflupredone, however,resulted in hypokalemia, making it a less-than-opti-mal treatment. 9 Inhaled Corticosteroids The use of inhaled corticosteroids has truly revolu-tionized the treatment of RAO and IAD. Althoughinitial systemic tapered corticosteroid therapy is of-ten necessary with all but mild IAD, regular inhaledtherapy is important for long-term success in manycases. The most important factor that limits regu-lar use of inhaled corticosteroids is cost, becausedrugs such as fluticasone and beclomethasone, arevery expensive. When assessing the effects of cor-ticosteroids on horses with airway disease, it is im-portant to note what delivery device and drugformulation was used because certain devices de-liver more drug to the lower airways, and certaindrug formulations, such as a proprietary formula-tion of beclomethasone a, have been shown at least in humans to reach the lower airways more reliably. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 249IN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSEFor this reason it is very difcult, to make com-parisons of drugs across studies that used differ-ent delivery devices. It is also important toremember that when comparing studies, the chlo-rofluorocarbon propellants that were used in olderstudies are not directly comparable to the cur-rently used hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA). Delivery Devices There are several devices currently on the marketfor use in horses treated with pre-packaged aerosols(metered-dose inhalers [MDI]) include the Aerohip-pus band the EquineHalerc. The choice as to which to use is largely determined by cost and which devicewill best suit the particular horse in question. Arecent study compared the Aerohippus and theEquineHaler using a pressurized MDI and HFA-albuterol horses withbronchospasm associated with exacerbation ofheaves. 10There was no statistical difference in the decrease in pulmonary resistance produced by albu-terol administered using the two different devices;however, there was a more consistent response withthe Aerohippus and a study using the prototype forthe Aerohippus showed superior delivery of a radio-labeled substance to the lower airways comparedwith the manufacturer's data for the EquineHaler. 11 Regardless of the type of mask/spacer device used,actual delivery of particles to the lower airways ispoor in the horse, given that indeed it is even inhumans, and the least efcacious means of deliver-ing aerosolized drugs is by jet nebulizer. Unfortu-nately, strategies that we know improve lungdeposition of aerosolized drugs in humans, such asslow deep breathing and breath holding, are notpractical in the horse. For the competition horse it is important to remember that, even though depo-sition of aerosolized drugs in horses is poor com-pared with that in humans, residues may still befound in horse's blood and urine, leading to thepossibility of the horse testing positive for the sub-stance, given that has been found with therapeuticallydelivered doses of fluticasone propionate. 12 Side Effects Aerosolized corticosteroids are frequently preferredover systemic in order to decrease potential sideeffects. This is well documented in humans, butwhile this is a rational approach in horses, there islittle documentation to support it. However, usingthe Aeromask and fluticasone propionate at a dose of2000 /H9262g twice daily, heaves-affected horses were shown to have signicant improvement in clinicalsigns and lung function and immune responses werestill intact. 13In contrast, a single 0.025 mg/kg bwt dose of dexamethasone given IV decreased total lym-phocyte counts in horses. Although there is evi-dence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA)suppression with all clinically relevant doses of be-clomethasone, this does not seem to pose a risk ofchronic HPA suppression or Addisonian crisis. 14Likewise, inhaled fluticasone propionate every 12 hours) may cause signicant decreases inserum cortisol after 7 days. 15Thus, inhaled corti - costeroids certainly have systemic effects; the hopeis that these effects will be less profound than withsystemic therapy. Efcacy of Inhaled Corticosteroids in Horses When comparing the potency of inhaled corticoste-roids, we are obliged to look at our favorite labanimal, the human, given that no real comparativestudies have been done in horses. Fluticasone pro-pionate is thought to be the most potent, has thelongest pulmonary residence time, and causes theleast adrenal suppression. In contrast, newer for-mulations of beclomethasone dipropionate that in-corporate HFA as the propellant have more uniformparticle size, and are more uniformly mixed, requir-ing little to no agitation or waiting before actuationof the inhaler. Fluticasone propionate resulted incomplete resolution of clinical signs in horses withexacerbation of heaves, as well as normalization ofpulmonary function tests and signicant decrease inBAL neutrophilia. In humans, there is less sys-temic absorption of fluticasone, but it is not knownwhether this is true in horses. In our clinic, we useboth inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate aand in - haled fluticasone proprionatedand the deciding fac - tor as to which one is used is often the cost. Forreasons that are not well understood, some horsesseem to do better on one drug than the other, andthe clinician must maintain a certain flexibility inchoosing drugs. In our clinic, we frequently treatwith an initial course of parenteral corticosteroids,typically, a 4-week, decreasing course of pred-nisolone, followed by inhaled corticosteroids. 3. Long-Term Control\u2014Bronchodilator Therapy As with corticosteroids, bronchodilators ad-ministered both systemically and via aerosol; aerosolization is by far the preferred methodbecause it minimizes side effects. Bronchodilatorsgenerally fall albuterol, which is known as salbutamol everywhere but in the United States, isprimarily administered by inhalation, and clenbuterolis administered orally. For by andhyoscine butylbromide ing bronchoconstriction, B2-ARs also cause epitheli-ated cilia in the airways to beat faster and withgreater coordination. There is also some evidencethat B2-ARs suppress airway mucus production.A lesser but potentially useful action of B2-ARs, isinhibition of release of inflammatory mediators 250 2017 /H11408Vol. ATHLETIC HORSESystemic Bronchodilator Therapy Clenbuterolfis a B2-AR that was approved for use in horses in the United States in 1998. In addi-tion to its use as a bronchodilator, clenbuterol hastocolytic effects in both women and animals, andhas a profound repartitioning effect in muscle,although the mechanism of this latter effect ispoorly understood. Practitioners should be awarethat reports of severe toxicity in horses given im-properly compounded formulations of clenbuterolhave emerged. 16The safety and efcacy of chronic administration of even the US Food and DrugAdministration-approved formulation of clenb-uterol is controversial. Chronic administration ofclenbuterol at 2.4 /H9262g/kg (5 days on, 2 days off, for 8 weeks) was reported to have a negative effect onaerobic performance in horses; however, a recentstudy reported that no negative effects on equinecardiac or skeletal muscle were seen when clenb-uterol was administered at up to 3.2 /H9262g/kg bwt, PO, daily for 14 days.16,17Tachyphylaxis also seems to be a problem with chronic administration of clenb-uterol. For example, a recent study demonstratedthat after 3 weeks of clenbuterol administration at0.8 /H9262g/kg bwt, PO, every 12 hours increased airway reactivity was evident and the horses were refrac-tory to the bronchodilatory effects of clenbuterol. 18 Reports of the efcacy of clenbuterol are also con- flicting. A large study by Erichsen et al19showed that 25% of horses had a decrease in clinical signs ofheaves when treated with clenbuterol at a dose of0.8 /H9262g/kg bwt, but a second study failed to show any benet on clinical signs when a similar dose wasadministered. 19,20Most horses seem to tolerate the lower doses of clenbuterol well, but with higherdoses horses may have, among other signs, tremors,tachycardia, sweating, and an appearance of anx-iousness. Together, these ndings suggest that thepractice of administering clenbuterol to horses toenhance performance is probably misguided at best,and harmful at worst. It is also important to rec-ognize that the recommended duration of treatmentis 30 days. Clenbuterol is not appropriate andshould not be used as a chronic therapy. Cautions Clenbuterol should be avoided in horses with car-diac disease, given that it can cause tachycardia andin pregnant mares, given that it antagonizes theeffects of oxytocin and prostaglandin F2 /H9251(PGF2 /H9251). Short-Acting B2-ARs Therapy These agents, such as albuterol and fenoterol, are ofvital importance in treatment of acute exacerbationsof RAO. Albuterol is recognized universally as arescue drug for both human asthmatics and horseswith IAD/RAO. Horses with current exacerbationsof RAO labor to breath and experience paroxysmalcoughing; within 10-30 minutes after aerosolizeddelivery of albuterol they will experience signicantrelief. However, the effect wears off within 1-3hours. It is important to remember that the in-flammatory condition will persist despite apparentimprovement due to transient bronchodilation, andthe disease will worsen. Regular use of B2 agonistsin the absence of anti-inflammatory medication maymask symptoms that would otherwise indicate pro-gressive worsening of the disease in particular, fur-ther airway obstruction with mucus. However, useof aerosolized albuterol for 10 days seemed not airway reactivity. 11Albuterol is the most af - B2 agonists; however,levalbuterol g, the R-enantiomer of albuterol, has recently become more affordable. Albuterol isthought to cause bronchoconstriction in someasthmatics, and there are in vitro reports to sug- gest that it may do so in horse airways as well 21; this adverse event may be avoided with the use oflevalbuterol. Recently, levalbuterol was shownto produce bronchodilation for 120 minutes vs 60minutes for albuterol in horses with RAO. 22 The preponderance of evidence shows that short- acting B2 agonists are not performance enhancingin humans, and there is no evidence to suggest thatthey are performance enhancing in horses. None-theless, all equine sporting events ban albuterol,and due care should be taken to stop drug adminis-tration before competition, noting that albuterol canbe detected in urine for at least 48 hours afteradministration via metered dose inhaler. Short-acting B2 agonists can be useful in horses with RAOand underlying airway obstruction to improve thereturn to training. Short-acting bronchodilatorsare also useful during lung-function testing to as-sess the reversibility of airway obstruction in horseswith RAO. No more than 450 /H9262g of albuterol by inhalation using MDI is necessary to bronchodilatemost horses, irrespective of the delivery devicechosen. Although aerosolized B2 agonists have a rela- tively low incidence of side effects, excessive use orsensitive individuals may experience systemic ef-fects such as trembling, anxiety and cardiac ar-rhythmias. The author has noted all these inindividuals treated with 900 /H9262g of albuterol, whereas other individuals show no signs of intoler-ance. Repeated use of the drug tends to decreaseside effects as the body down-regulates receptors.Very occasionally, horses may exhibit signs of bron-choconstriction following administration of B2 ago-nists. This paradoxical response is likely due to theeffects of the drug vehicle on airways and is usuallytransient. Long-Acting Inhaled B2-ARs Therapy We treat selected cases of RAO and moderate IADwith long-acting B2-ARs therapy in addition to in-haled corticosteroids, with the initial impression ofenhanced performance and quality of life. It can-not be emphasized enough, however, that regularuse of long-acting B2-ARs must be accompaniedwith regular use corticosteroids. The AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 251IN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE THE HORSEmost commonly used long-acting B2-ARs are salme-terol and formoterol. Their duration of action inhorses is 6-8 hours. Inhaled Parasympatholytic Therapy The most commonly used inhaled parasympatho-lytic drug is ipratropium, a quaternary ammoniumderivative of atropine; which produces bronchodila-tion lasting approximately 6 hours, which is at least3 hours longer than albuterol. 23Although adverse side effects such as thickened mucus, tachycardia,and decreased ciliary beat frequency are possiblewith parasympatholytics, no such side effects havebeen reported in horses administered doses up to1200 /H9262g. Ipratropium cannot be considered a res- cue drug, unlike atropine, because it has much lon-ger onset of action; however, the effect may lastsomewhat longer than atropine. In severely af-fected RAO horses, the combination of albuterol andipratropium may be benecial. Mast-Cell Stabilizers These agents are cromones that block calcium chan-nels preventing the release of histamine and tryptase,and the subsequent downstream cascade of prosta-glandin formulation that eventuallycause bronchoconstriction. Sodium cromoglycate canbe efcacious in treating known mast cell-mediatedIAD, but will not be of use for treating the majority ofhorses with neutrophil-mediated disease, and there-fore they are less useful for RAO. It should be notedthat the best evidence for their use is quite old. 24 Moreover, use of mast cell stabilizers requires consid-erable owner compliance, given that the maximumresponse to these drugs occurs at 1-2 weeks afterbeginning treatment. Other Therapeutic Approaches There are, unfortunately, few pharmacologic treat-ments with proved efcacy other than corticoste-roids and bronchodilators. A recent approachtaken involved the attempt to shift the Th1/Th2immunologic balance by administering inhalednanoparticles of cytosine-phosphate-tuanosine oli-gonucleotides, which did result in some promisingoutcomes including decreases in tracheal wash neu-trophils and improved lung function and clinicalscores. 25Curcumin, which comes from the spice turmeric, and has been shown to be efcacious inpulmonary brosis and asthma in humans, has alsobeen used in horses with RAO by decreasing thecellularity of the BAL fluid. 26Finally, although earlier studies using sunflower oil and sealblubberas a source showed no efcacy of omega-3 fatty acidsin ameliorating signs of RAO, a study acid in addition to a low-dust envi-ronment did signicantly improve clinical signs inhorses with RAO. 27 Cell-Based Therapy The most recent and intriguing approach to equineasthma is the use of cell-based therapies. A recentin vitro study used lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated equine alveolar macrophages as a model for treated these cells with conditionedmedium from amniotic mesenchymal cells to deter-mine whether the conditioned medium was able toameliorate the effect of the inflammatory cytokinesthat resulted from LPS treatment. Their most signif-icant nding was that the conditioned medium didindeed decrease the production of TNF- /H9251from the alveolar macrophages.28This approach certainly war - rants further investigation. 4. Environmental Remediation It is important to note that a recent study demon-strated that environmental control was by far themost important means of treating airway inflamma-tion and dysfunction in horses with heaves, andthat, indeed, antigen avoidance decreases airwaysmooth muscle mass. 1The barn environment is replete with organic particulate matter, respirableendotoxin, molds, and volatile gases such as ammo-nia. The worst offenders seem to be hay and straw.Multiple studies have shown that signicant im-provements can be made by replacing dusty sub-strates and feed with less dusty substitutes. Forinstance, pelleted hay and wood shavings are oftenbetter than regular hay and straw bedding. 29,30 Indoor arenas present another high dust challengeto the horse, but good management can mitigate theproblem. 31In addition to changing to low-dust feeds and beddings, the following recommendationsto owners should be made: Feed hay from the ground, not from a hay net Soak hay well before feeding or use ensiled or baked hay products Wet any dusty grain (e.g., pellets) before feeding Sprinkle aisleways with water before sweeping Avoid storing hay overhead. If unavoidable, lay a tarp under the hay to avoid dust rainingdown on the horses Use a humectant or hygroscopic agent to re- duce dust in the indoor and outdoor arenas Remove horses from the barn while cleaning stalls or moving hay Do not use blowers to clean aisles Remove cobwebs and other dust collectors rou- tinely when horses are of the barn Keep barn doors open to promote good ventilation An overarching principle that can be derived fromthe US Occupational Safety and Health Administra-tion Dust Control Handbook is that prevention isbetter than cure. In addition to the well-knownpresentation of summer pasture-associated recur-rent airway obstruction in hot, humid southernstates, it is important to remember that horses inNew England can also have disease that presentsprimarily in the spring and summer, and that seems 252 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: PULMONARY DISEASE IN THE ATHLETIC HORSEto improve when horses are kept temporarily inclean, nondusty indoor environments. A recentstudy in the northern hemisphere conrmed thatenvironmental heat and airborne pollens are bothassociated with an increase in severity in equineasthma signs. 32 5. Evaluation of Therapeutic Outcome It is important to have a baseline assessment ofthe horse prior to initiating therapy. Ideally, thiswould include auscultation with and without arebreathing bag, careful physical examination, ob-servation during exercise, BAL, and baseline pulmo-nary function testing for horses with IAD and RAOand measurement of airway reactivity for horsessuffering from IAD or in the case of horses withRAO, post-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests.Although historically pulmonary function testingwas available only at a few specialized veterinarypulmonology clinics, user-friendly systems for eldtesting are now available, making objective baselineassessments possible for practitioners. The goal ofa thorough baseline assessment is to facilitate atreatment regimen tailored to the individual horse,and to monitor response to therapy. Horses shouldthen be evaluated 1-2 months after initiation oftherapy to assess response and guide therapy for theupcoming months. If there is poor response to ther-apy, it is important to do some detective work todetermine why treatment has been unsuccessful.For example, it is essential to check the client'stechnique for using the drug delivery device. Fail-ure to modify the environment may, in some horses,negate any attempts at drug therapy. Some horseswith chronic, severe pathology may be resistant tocorticosteroids or may have irreversible changes inthe lungs that prevent response to bronchodilators.Finally, lack of response to therapy may be due tounderlying infectious disease and may indicate theneed for further diagnostics and perhaps an entirelydifferent approach or concomitant antibiotic use.

Introduction Veterinarians who work with horses have a higherrisk of serious injury than reghters, police of-cers, and other civilian occupations, according to arecent study in the United Kingdom. 1Equine vet- erinarians suffer approximately eight injuries overtheir career, and the primary cause is from a kick or strike by the horse. Behavior problems duringveterinary care are common; a horse that is unfa-miliar with a veterinary procedure, has had anegative experience, or is frightened or injuredcan take longer to examine and cause a great dealof damage. Practices that reduce behavior prob-lems in the horse will help mitigate the risk ofinjury to veterinarians. A limited understanding of learning principles and science-based behavior modication techniquesmay be linked to the high incidence of injury. 2 A survey of veterinarians in the United Kingdomfound that most lacked education about and didnot use methods based on learning principles andscience-based behavior modication methods; instead,dangerous situations were generally managedwith chemical or physical restraint. Althoughnecessary in some situations, restraint can pro-voke even more dangerous escape responses anddoes little to resolve behavior problems, whichrequires addressing the horse's emotional stateand the environment. Handling methods that promote calm emotions and prevent stress, anxiety, and fear are recom-mended by the American Veterinary Society of An-imal Behavior. 3Positive veterinary care practices can increase caregiver safety and animal welfare,4 as well as improve diagnosis and treatment out-comes; when a patient becomes fearful or anxiousduring an exam, sympathetic arousal can interferewith accurate diagnosis. 3Even pain-free proce- dures can cause discomfort if the animal is tense, orif punishment and restraint are used to control be-havior. Fear and anxiety negatively affect futurehealth care as well; even one unpleasant veterinaryexperience can generalize to subsequent visits, andwhen an animal has a history of fear and behaviorproblems the owner is less likely to call theveterinarian. The use of behavior modication techniques based on principles of learning can reduce fear and prob-lem behaviors 5,6and promote positive veterinary care.4Low-stress handling and nonaversive be- havior modication methods have been widely ad-opted among veterinary professionals who workwith small animals 4,6and large captive land and marine mammals.7,8Similar strategies can be ap- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 255HOW TO HAVE A HAPPY EQUINE PATIENT DURING HEALTH CARE PROCEDURES NOTESplied to horses to improve caregiver safety, healthcare efciency and outcomes, as well as animal wel-fare. 5,9In fact, it can be reasonably argued that maintaining positive interaction is even more impor-tant for larger and potentially more dangerous spe-cies. The following sections describe positivemethods based on well-tested, scientically soundprinciples of learning and behavior modication andtheir application in equine veterinary practice. The Cycle of Anxiety and Avoidance: How Horses Learnto Misbehave Fear and anxiety are the root cause of behaviorproblems with veterinary care, including not stand-ing still for examination; barging or pushing; reluc-tance to enter the exam room, stocks or trailers;bolting or pulling away when led; and biting, kick-ing, or striking. These behaviors are often inadver-tently reinforced by the release of pressure (negativereinforcement) and will be repeated. Anxiety oftenbegins with normal wariness about an unfamiliarobject or situation. If the horse then also experi-ences stress or pain, it will learn to anticipate theobject or situation as a potential threat, and alsolearn to fear anything associated with it, a processcalled fear conditioning. Horses, as a prey species,are especially adept at this type of learning. Inveterinary care, things associated with an unpleas-ant procedure might include the location, veterinar-ian, or equipment. For example, a horse thatexperiences distress or discomfort during an injec-tion may become anxious simply at the sight of thesyringe because it is reliably associated with theinjection. Individual horses respond differently to various stressful situations and levels of discomfort. Mostcope with aversive conditions well, but others showextreme reactions. On one extreme are horses thatshut down and withdraw; on the other extreme arehorses that attempt to escape, and if prevented fromdoing so, may become aggressive. Fear-based de-fensive aggressive responses are dangerous; theyalmost always remove, terminate, or postpone theprocedure, if only briefly, and are thus inadvertentlyreinforced and will be repeated. The cycle of anxi-ety and avoidance (Fig. 1) will persist if a horse isput back into the same situation in which the fearand problem behavior previously occurred. Managing behavior problems with punishment and/or increased physical restraint is more likely toescalate than to break the cycle of anxiety and avoid-ance. Punishment and physical restraint add tothe horse's discomfort and anxiety. Restraining de-vices, such as a lip or ear twitch, stud chain, orantirearing bit, are conventionally used to control the horse's behavior during veterinary care. 1 It is also common practice to punish unwantedbehavior by jerking on a halter or chain, waving awhip or rope, striking the horse, or yellingsharply, despite recommendations against the useof punishment by the American Veterinary Soci-ety of Animal Behaviorists. 10 Behavior Modication: Preventing and ReversingProblems The goal of behavior modication in veterinary careis to reduce both the underlying fear and unwantedbehavior, as well as to strengthen positive emotionsand compliance. A behavior analysis of the prob-lem helps identify learned causes as well as otherpossible contributing factors such as physical pain,neurological and metabolic conditions, and infec-tious disease. 5Identifying the reasons for the fear and anxiety is an important rst step, and behaviorcan be improved by eliminating or treating them.When a learned cause is suspected, evidence-basedbehavior modication techniques can help meet be-havior-change goals. 4,5,9,11Selected techniques particularly useful to veterinarians who work withhorses are described in the following sections. 2. Monitoring for Relaxation and Recognizing EarlySigns of Fear and Anxiety Maximizing a calm emotional state and minimizingfear and arousal requires keeping the horse as calmas possible, and monitoring body language for relax-ation and early signs of anxiety. When a horse isrelaxed, unwanted behaviors are less likely to occur,and the long-term effectiveness of behavior modi-cation is improved. Animals learn best at mild tomoderate levels of sympathetic arousal\u2014when theyshow attention, without tension; at higher levels ofarousal the brain is primed for defensive action andfear conditioning. A horse's facial expressions, 12 posture, and muscle tension offer a window into itsinternal emotional state and provide a tool for as-sessing the animal's level of arousal, anxiety, andattention (Fig. 2). 13,14 3. Creating a Relaxing Environment A familiar axiom among behaviorists is \"the ABC'sof learning,\" which is an abbreviation for anteced-ents, behavior, and consequences. Arranging ante- Fig. 1. The cycle of anxiety and avoidance. 256 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO HAVE A HAPPY EQUINE PATIENT DURING HEALTH CARE PROCEDUREScedents is a powerful and effective strategy formaintaining an animal's positive emotions and calmdemeanor. Antecedents refer to any cues in theenvironment that predict whether something pleas-ant or threatening might occur, or if a response willbe rewarded or punished. If the experience is re-peated, the horse learns to anticipate the event andwill start to react sooner, in response to these ante-cedent cues. Horses often react to cues associated with veteri- nary care because they are distinctive, ritualized,and predictable. The horse is led to a particularlocation where the procedure takes place, an ambu-latory veterinarian truck is parked nearby, the vet-erinarian sets up special equipment, and the exam iscarried out in a xed order. This means that ahorse can readily learn to anticipate a veterinaryvisit and respond long before the exam or procedurebegins. Previously neutral objects will elicit fear ifthey have been associated with pain or discomfort,and through the process of generalization, othersimilar stimuli can also begin to elicit fear, anxiety,and problem behaviors. Alternatively, creating apositive association with the veterinary experiencepromotes calm emotions and behavior. The location where the veterinary exam takes place is a common trigger for anxiety if a bad expe-rience previously occurred in that area. The horsemay be more relaxed if the exam is conducted ina different location, particularly one previouslyassociated with positive experiences. Conductingprocedures in a quiet environment with few distrac-tions, minimizing noises linked to specic proce-dures\u2014for example, by using silent clippers\u2014andlimiting the use of bright lights, are recommended. 6 Emotional states are socially facilitated (contagious)in horses, so having a relaxed, familiar horse nearbycan help calm some nervous horses. Conductingveterinary exams or procedures in the horse's stall isnot recommended; this area should be reserved as asanctuary or \"safe zone\" where nothing unpleasanthappens. If a horse is overly fearful or anxious, or if its behavior is dangerous, the veterinary exam can bebroken up into multiple visits, and nonessential pro-cedures postponed for a later time. 6In some cases, anxiety-reducing medications and products can im-prove behavior in the moment, as well as increasethe effectiveness of behavior modication. 4. Habituation and Systematic Acclimation to NovelObjects and Situations The initial veterinary experience can have a pro-found and lasting effect on future behavior. At thistime, the horse's reactions to unfamiliar people, sit-uations, sensations, and equipment are unlearnedand automatic. Habituating the horse to beinghandled and examined is an important goal of pos-itive veterinary care. Habituation refers to a de-crease in the strength of a response with repeatedexposure to the object or experience, and will occurif a situation is nonthreatening. Potentially fear-inducing novel objects, situations, or mildly aversiveveterinary procedures can be introduced graduallythrough the process of systematic acclimation. If the potentially threatening situation is too strong, persists, or intensies, then sensitizationmight occur; the horse's senses become heightenedand skeletal muscles mobilize for defensive action.In horses, defensive behaviors escalate in a predict-able action sequence that includes orient, freeze,dget, avoid, flee, and ght (Fig. 2). The sequencereflects increasing sympathetic arousal and cogni-tive capacity for fear conditioning. Sensitizationcan be avoided by monitoring body language andarranging the situation to reduce levels of arousaland anxiety, but prevention is the best medicine.Taking a proactive approach with young horses byproviding positive, mildly stressful experiences willhelp build resilience to veterinary handling, equip-ment, and procedures. 5. Reducing Fear and Problem Behaviors withSystematic Desensitization Systematic desensitization works to overcome ahorse's learned fear of an otherwise-harmless objector situation through gradual, progressive exposureto the feared stimulus. The stimulus is presentedat a low intensity and/or short duration, while thehorse remains calm and without triggering fear ordefensive behavior. Through repeated nonthreat-ening experiences, the negative emotions and prob- lematic behavior decrease. The intensity andduration of exposure to the feared object or situation Fig. 2. A cartoon illustration of the equine defensive action sequence. Responses having low arousal and low perceived threat areon the left, with increasing arousal and greater perceived danger on the right. Response categories include (a) relaxation, (b)attention, (c) tension (d), avoidance, and (e) flight. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 257HOW TO HAVE A HAPPY EQUINE PATIENT DURING HEALTH CARE PROCEDURESis gradually increased, typically over multiple ses-sions, and if the horse should display stress-relatedor defensive behaviors at any time duringthe process, the intensity and duration of exposureis reduced. Systematic desensitization isoften combined with relaxation techniques andcounterconditioning. 6. Counterconditioning Counterconditioning is a treatment for phobias andconditioned fears in which the individual learns anincompatible response when presented with thefeared but otherwise-harmless stimulus. It worksby creating a new association between the fearedstimulus and a pleasant stimulus. The pleasantstimulus elicits a positive emotion and relaxed re-sponse, which replaces the fear and withdrawalbehaviors. After repeated pairings between thefeared and pleasant stimuli, the previously fearedstimulus comes to predict a rewarding rather thanan unpleasant event. In practice, countercondi-tioning is typically used in conjunction with gradualexposure to the feared stimulus (systematicdesensitization). Counterconditioning can be applied broadly to veterinary handling, procedures, restraints, andequipment. 4For example, a horse with a learned fear of injections may withdraw from the syringe bybecoming tense, raising its head, and stepping back-ward. Although the syringe is harmless, it has be-come aversive through past association with adistressing or painful experience. During counter-conditioning, the syringe would be paired with andpredict something pleasant, like a treat placed in adish on the ground, such that when the syringe ispresented, the horse remains calm, drops its head,and takes a step forward for the treat. Calm emo-tions and head dropping thus become the horse'snewly conditioned response to the syringe. By denition, counterconditioning is a classical conditioning process that involves pairing the fearedstimulus and the pleasant stimulus at the sametime. For example, with a needle-shy horse thesyringe (the feared stimulus) might be held againstthe horse's neck for 10 seconds, and at the sametime the horse would get treats (the pleasant stim-ulus). The treats would stop when the syringe isremoved. A recent study found, however, that amodied counterconditioning technique was moreeffective and resulted in a lower risk of relapse; themodied technique involves rst presenting thefeared stimulus, and then offering the reward onlyafter the animal performs a desired behavior. 15For example, modied counterconditioning could beused in a needle-shy horse. The syringe would beheld against the horse's neck for 10 seconds, andtreats presented only if the horse stands calmly (thedesired behavior). Distraction with pleasurable activities can also help to promote relaxation by shifting the horse'sattention away from the veterinary procedure.Engaging the horse in a previously trained, familiar,positively reinforced task such as touching its noseto a target for a treat reward 16will divide attention, reduce stress, and create a positive association withthe veterinary procedure. Scratches or massageare relaxation techniques that can also be used asdistracting activities. 17For example, a gelding scratched on the belly with a stiff brush when hishoof was trimmed immediately stopped dgetingand pulling his leg away. Pharmacological agentsand supplements such as calming pheromones or asedative administered orally or rectally can alsohelp reduce anxiety before veterinary procedures. 7. Overshadowing Overshadowing18is a technique used to attenuate fear and related problem behaviors that can be ap-plied to horses. The horse is lead forward withdetermination, as if going somewhere, or back andforth a few steps using forward and reverse rein cue,and at the same time the feared stimulus is intro-duced. The horse should be rst trained to stepforward and backward on light rein pressure. Themovement of the horse distinguishes overshadowingfrom other exposure methods for reducing fear-based problem behaviors. Overshadowing has been used in veterinary care on horses that are fearful during injections andwhen clipped. Reports about its effectiveness atreducing problem behaviors and decreasing sympa-thetic arousal have been primarily anecdotal, andempirical conrmation is lacking. Whether over-shadowing works via habituation, desensitization,flooding, or some other mechanism is not clear.Restraining devices, such as an anti-rearing bit, areoften used to direct the horse's movement and simul-taneously prevent unwanted responses. Becausethe horse is moving forward or stepping back andforth while being injected or clipped, implementingovershadowing requires a skilled handler to avoidflooding. 8. Avoid Flooding Flooding refers to exposing the horse to a high in-tensity of the feared object or situation until theunwanted response disappears. At the same time,the horse is typically conned or restrained to pre-vent it from escaping or even performing the prob-lem behavior. One example of flooding would be ahorse with fear of hoof trimming and severely over-grown feet who is placed in stocks with its hoofsecurely tied up with rope (response prevention) touse an angle grinder on it (high intensity of thefeared stimulus). It is called flooding because thehorse is overexposed to the feared stimulus and\"flooded\" with fear and anxiety. In theory, floodingshould lead to extinction of the fear and defensivebehavior, and break the cycle of anxiety and avoid-ance. In practice, flooding is distressing or eventraumatic, leads to behaviors that are unsafe forboth horse and caretaker, and can worsen the fear 258 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO HAVE A HAPPY EQUINE PATIENT DURING HEALTH CARE PROCEDURESand problem behavior, especially if the horse breaksfree from the restraint. The use of flooding inequine veterinary care and training is notrecommended. 5,18 9. Reinforce Desired Behaviors and Avoid ReinforcingUnwanted Behavior Strengthening desired behaviors and decreasingproblem behaviors using operant conditioning oftencalls for a two-pronged strategy. One prong in-volves positively reinforcing (Table 1) desired behav-ior, such as standing calmly or offering a hoof.Sometimes the desired behavior must be shapedrst, by progressively rewarding closer and closerapproximations of the goal behavior. The secondprong is to stop reinforcing problem behaviors,which often persist because they are accidentallyreinforced. Any behavior that delays a procedure,even briefly, will be negatively reinforced (release ofpressure; Table 1) and repeated in the future. Ide-ally the environment has already been set up tominimize fear and problem behaviors, but it is im-portant to be prepared if they occur. The needle-shy horse offers a useful example of how the two prongs of differential reinforcement canbe applied. A needle-shy horse often barges for-ward as the veterinarian approaches with a syringein hand. When the person takes a step back to getof the way, the barging behavior is reinforced be-cause the horse gains some distance from the fearedsyringe and delays the injection. Instead, the per-son should keep the syringe in a constant position,moving with the horse as it steps forward, and thenremove the syringe only after the horse stops mov-ing. Doing this will reinforce the desired behaviorof standing still, but not the unwanted behavior ofmoving away. This example incorporates two effec-tive strategies. First, the reinforced calm behavior,standing still, cannot occur at the same time as theproblem behavior, barging forward; this procedure iscalled differential reinforcement of incompatible be-havior. Second, the desired behavior is a replace-ment for the problem behavior because it leads tothe same reinforcing consequence, which is gainingdistance from the feared syringe. Compliance canbe further enhanced by applying a well-timed posi-tive reinforcement/distraction in the form of vigor-ous scratching at the withers, similar to mutualgrooming among herdmates 17or a food reward for standing still with the syringe in place. 10. Avoid Punishment Punishment stops behavior by adding somethingunpleasant after the behavior occurs. The useof punishment in veterinary care is not recom-mended. 10As a behavior-change method it is reac - tive rather than prophylactic and applied only afterthe potentially dangerous problem behavior has al-ready occurred. Punishment can suppress warningsigns of escalating anxiety but not the explosiveescape or aggressive behavior. It is also subject tomisuse and can adversely affect the horse-humanrelationship because learned fear of the individualdelivering the punishment may occur. Despite theconcerns, in practice fear-based behaviors are oftenpunished with forceful, painful, and confrontationalmethods, including yanking on a shank or bit; wav-ing a whip or rope; yelling sharply at the horse; andstriking the horse with a hand, boot, crop, or otherobject. A major shortcoming of punishment is that it does not address the fear at the root of many behaviorproblems, and fear cannot be reduced through forceor pain. Instead, punishment validates the horse'sfear and adds to the unpleasant experience. Therepeated use of punishment can also lead to an ex-Table 1. The Four Quadrants of Operant Conditioning Reinforcement Increases Behavior Punishment Stops Behavior Positive (/H11001) Something is added R/H11001Positive Reinforcement P /H11001Positive Punishment Behavior increases because it results in something pleasant being added.Behavior stops because it results in something unpleasant being added. Example: The horse drops his head because he gets scratched on the neck orwithers.Example: The horse stops raising his head because the lead rope is yanked sharply. Negative (-) Something is removed R-Negative Reinforcement P-Negative Punishment Behavior increases because it results in something unpleasant being removed.Behavior stops because it results in something pleasant being removed. Example: The horse turns her hindquarters away from theveterinarian because it delays havingthe rectal thermometer inserted.Example: The horse stops pawing at the ground because she is ignored and does notget the attention she seeks. Operant conditioning refers to voluntary behavior that is shaped by its consequences, which are pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Reinforcement refers to behavior that leads to pleasant consequences and is repeated in the future, whereas punishment refers tobehavior that leads to unpleasant consequences and is inhibited in the future. An animal's actions also add or remove something fromthe environment. When something is added the mathematical notation \"positive\" is used, and when something is removed orsubtracted the mathematical notation \"negative\" is used. This table is the denition and example of each of the four quadrants ofoperant conditioning (positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment). AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 259HOW TO HAVE A HAPPY EQUINE PATIENT DURING HEALTH CARE PROCEDURESpansion of fear conditioning and a worsening of theproblem behavior, with greater intensity and earlieronset as the horse anticipates not only the veteri-nary care, but also the unpleasant punishment.Even when punishment seems to work, fear may beinternalized and the behavior problem only tempo-rarily suppressed. 11. Use the Minimum Restraint Necessary The use of low-stress handling and minimum re-straint is encouraged in positive veterinary care. 4,6 Veterinary professionals set an example for ownersand the public about how to properly handle animalsin a safe and humane manner. Developing goodhandling skills increases the safety of caregivers,and allowing the horse to cooperate voluntarily re-duces stress by giving it greater control over thesituation. Physical restraint plays a crucial role inmanaging horse behavior and providing support,and some methods of restraint are less stressfulthan others. For example, a lip twitch seems tohave a short-term calming effect, whereas an eartwitch operates through pain avoidance. 19When re - straint is paired with discomfort or distress, simplybeing restrained can become a conditioned triggerfor fear, anxiety, and behavior problems. This ef-fect can be mitigated by knowing how to apply anduse restraints properly, as well as where to positiononeself. If the procedure is painful, chemical re-straint may be advised. 12. Conclusion The equine veterinarian plays a critical role as anagent of change by practicing positive care, educat-ing owners and trainers, and referring to behaviorprofessionals. Implementing positive methods in aveterinary practice takes patience and planning, butcan lead to increased safety and equine welfare, aswell as happier human clients. It can be accom-plished by creating a relaxing environment in whichto conduct exams and procedures, recognizing andreducing fear, applying techniques such as counter-conditioning and positive reinforcement to increasedesired behavior and stop problem behaviors, andusing low-stress restraint properly. These and other methods described in this paper are summa-rized in Table 2. When positive techniques arecontinued between veterinary visits and over thehorse's lifetime, the risk of relapse of the fear,anxiety, and behavior problems are minimized.

Behavior Modication Recommendations for Positive Equine Veterinary Care 1. Read equine body language and facial expressions, to recognize relaxation and respond to early signs of fear, anxiety, and sympathetic arousal. 2. Work in a location that is comfortable for the horse and remove triggers of fear, anxiety, and defensive behaviors from the environment. 3. Habituate horses to new procedures and equipment; use systematic acclimation when introducing young or inexperienced horses to a potentially fear-inducing novel object, situation, or aversive procedure. 4. When the horse has a learned fear from a previous aversive experience, use systematic desensitization to gradually and progressively reintroduce the feared, but harmless, stimulus, while the horse remains calm. 5. Apply counterconditioning to replace fear-based emotions and behavior to veterinary procedures and equipment, with relaxed emotions and behaviors. 6. Overshadowing involves stepping the horse back and forth while at the same time presenting the feared stimulus, such that the directed movement \"overshadows\" and prevents the fear-based defensive response. 7. Avoid the use of flooding, which triggers fear and defensive behavior, and then uses force to prevent and suppress it.8. Shape desired behavior and strengthen it with positive reinforcement; stop negatively reinforcing the problematic escape and avoidance behaviors. 9. Avoid punishing unwanted behavior using confrontational or painful methods, which increase fear, worsen behavior problems, and negatively affect equine welfare and the horse-human relationship. 10.

Introduction As a companion to Robin Foster's opening presenta-tion on scientic principles of animal learning rele-vant to handling horses for healthcare procedures,this presentation will focus on specic application ofthese principles to gaining and maintaining patientcompliance with veterinary care. In addition togeneral comments, specic recommendations will beoutlined for each of ve example common healthcareprocedures, for routine application aimed at pre-venting aversions, as well as for rehabilitation ofestablished aversions. The 2000 Proceedings of the American Associa- tion of Equine Practitioners includes a detailed discussion of rehabilitation of injection shyness and other treatment aversions using scienticallysound learning principles and behavior modicationtechniques. The Proceedings paper is available on the University of Pennsylvania Havemeyer EquineBehavior Lab web page. 1 2. General CommentsRestraint and Assistance A substantial part of the art of positive reinforcement- based behavior modication for gaining compliancewith a mildly aversive procedure involves judgingand implementing the most helpful restraint for theparticular animal, procedure, environment, andskill of personnel. For many horses, it is worth-while arranging for some wiggle room and planningto safely ride out some movement. The patient'sability to move, even a little bit, as opposed to beingtrapped, typically reduces the risk of explosive es-cape or defensively aggressive responses. Careshould be taken to survey the environment in antic-ipation of obstacles, for example a water bucket, thatif contacted could cause a commotion that would addnegative consequences (punishment). Particularlywhen rehabilitating a horse that has developed dangerous avoidance responses, personal safetygear, such as safety shoes, vest, and helmet can behelpful. The benet of one or more assistants will similarly vary with the procedure, the environment, and theskills of available assistants. When positive dis-traction and or/reward (food or scratching) is neededduring the procedure, as opposed to only before andafter, an assistant can be very helpful to hold thehorse and deliver the distraction. Shaping Compliance with Mildly Aversive Procedures When shaping compliance with a mildly aversive procedure, attention should focus on maintaining 262 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSHOW TO HAVE A HAPPY EQUINE PATIENT DURING HEALTH CARE PROCEDURES NOTESthe patient's relaxation and tolerance of the proce-dure rather than on any undesirable avoidance be-havior. This enables recognition and well-timedreinforcement of relaxation with each increment oftolerance. While it helps to be prepared for anyanticipated undesirable behaviors, simply ignoringundesirable responses whenever possible will speedprogress. The most efcient results can be ex-pected when assistants (as well as any observers)remain calm, relaxed, and non-reactive to any un-desirable responses. Those working with the pa-tient should maintain focus on prompting,anticipating, and immediately positively reinforcingprogress. Any response that can be perceived aspunishment, such as verbal or physical reprimandor punitive restraint, should be avoided. Avoiding the \"Avoidance Cycle\" It goes without saying that reactivity to aversivestimuli is a natural adaptive response. When thereaction interrupts the procedure, a common inadver-tent mistake is to keep repeating the same approach.This is essentially a negative reinforcement (pressureand release) paradigm, which is particularly effective at teaching avoidance. A good rule of thumb is thatif the patient successfully avoids more than once, itis best to discontinue or signicantly modify theapproach. Successful rehabilitation often requiresa toolbox of multiple approaches to various proce-dures, along with a variety of positive distractorsand generous rewards to offset the aversive aspect. Primary and Secondary Positive Reinforcement/DistractorOptions For most horses, a small food tidbit is an effective primary positive reinforcement, both for routinepreventative purposes or for rehabilitation of an established aversion. For extended rehabilitationsessions, a variety of treat items can be alternated tomaintain interest and higher motivation than a sin-gle type. If for any reason (e.g., owner preference;NPO restrictions) food is not an option, vigorousrhythmic scratching at the withers for most horsesmay be an effective substitute. For routine main-tenance of compliance, a reasonable percentage ofpatients will quickly learn to associate the health-care provider with food treats. To prevent the food-urgent patient from becoming nudgy or nippy, foodreinforcement can be delivered from a small feedpan, always reaching under the head to deliver thetreat on the off side. Most horses will learn toanticipate food only when the pan is presented.When expecting a reward the horse will turn thehead to the off side rather than toward the person.In some cases it may be necessary to switch fromfood to scratching at the withers as the primaryreinforcement. An auditory secondary reinforce-ment, e.g., a clicker sound or a word or short phrasespoken in consistent volume and tone, if paired withthe primary reinforcement, will quickly take on pos-itive value (conditioned positive reinforcement),such that it can be effective when used alone inter-mittently as needed.Caretaker \"Homework\"Horse owners/caretakers can often work effectivelyon their own to introduce young horses comfortably toa battery of potential health care procedures, or even to perform systematic desensitization procedures forhorses with established or developing aversions.As with any client education, clear instruction andfollow up will ensure best results.

Ann E. Dwyer, DVM Equine veterinary practices deliver a wide range of services and products to a diverse group ofpatients and horse owners. Equine practices also vary in size, ranging from solo ambulatorypractices to hospital practices that employ dozens of veterinarians. However, all equine veterinarybusinesses spend their income on a nite, consistent set of expense categories. The proportion of income that is spent on these expenses is remarkably similar in all carefully managed practices, no matter thesize or shape of the business. Understanding where the money goes is an essential part of practicemanagement that also provides the foundation for understanding the dollars that are available to be spenton veterinary compensation. Author's address: Genesee Valley Introduction Ordinary veterinary practice income is derivedfrom fees for professional services. Income re-lated to fees for veterinary services is received inthe form of credit card payments, checks, andcash. This revenue is deposited in a practice bank account, and recorded in the practice bookkeepingsystem as well as whatever practice managementsystem the practice uses to track of medical re-cords and bill clients. The most common nancial accounting bookkeeping system used by equine prac-titioners is Quickbooks. a It should be noted that \"practice income\" only occurs when revenue is actually paid to the busi-ness. Many equine practices offer extensive creditto their clients, and thus carry signicant \"accountsreceivable\", or ledgers of monies owed for servicesrendered but not yet paid for. \"Gross billings\" donot equal \"income\" until currency actually changeshands.Many veterinary practices also receive minor amounts of revenue from activity that is unrelatedto veterinary practice operations. These sourcesinclude gain on sale of assets, seminar or sponsor-ship revenues, fees for participation in clinical trials,client billing fees, bank account interest revenue,and discounts or rebates from suppliers for volumepurchases or timely payment. Accounting softwareprograms such as Quickbooks track such revenue onthe prot and loss statement separately from incomerelated to the delivery of veterinary services. Forthis paper, only income related to the actual provi-sion of veterinary services will be discussed. Practice Expense Practice management analytics are simplied if thepractice bookkeeping system is set up so that allroutine business expenses are coded and trackedconsistently. A comprehensive Equine VeterinaryPractice Chart of Accounts (EVPCOA) is availableas an 1This publication AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 269THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE NOTESpresents guidelines for the organization of the practicebookkeeping system that segregates every penny ofpractice expense into simple, logical categories enu-merated by specic numeric codes that reflect the op-eration of equine practices of all sizes. Practiceexpenses related to the delivery of veterinary servicesin equine practice can be grouped in 5 categories asoutlined in the EVPCOA: 1. Cost of professional services (COPS; or cost of goods sold [COGS]) 2. Facility expense3. Ofce expense4. Labor expense5. Depreciation expenseIntegrating categories listed the EVPCOA with the practice's Quickbooks system provides apowerful tool for practice nancial analytics. Aslong as income and expenses are entered in a timelyand consistent fashion, the Quickbooks accountingsoftware program provides reports that analyze thepercentage of income that is spent on these 5 cate-gories with the click of a mouse for any given year,quarter, month, or other interval, and readily com-pares the results to the preceding interval. COPS, also known as COGS, is one of the larg- est expense categories of any equine practice. Itcaptures the practice costs that are directly relatedto the delivery of veterinary services. In the deliv-ery of their services, equine practitioners routinelydo examinations, treatments, and surgeries. Theyalso perform a variety of imaging procedures, andadminister and dispense many pharmaceuticals.They order laboratory tests in house and send sam-ples to outside laboratories. Delivery of care in-volves the consumption of a variety of suppliesincluding bandages, catheters, suture, gloves, sy-ringes, needles, etc. Hospital practices incur coststo purchase feed and bedding. All these expensesfall into the category of COPS/COGS, which can bethought of as the direct costs relating to the \"hands-on\" delivery of patient care. Examples of expensesthat qualify as COPS/COGS include bills paid topharmaceutical distributors, bills paid to referencelaboratories, the cost of vaccines and the expensesrelated to archival and retrieval of digital images. Facility expense , as dened by the EVPCOA is the cost involved in upkeep of the various elementsof the practice that allow equine veterinarians todeliver their services. These elements include theday-to-day expenses, rent, taxes, and repair costs ofany \"brick-and-mortar\" structures associated withthe business, the expenses involved in operating andmaintaining ambulatory vehicles, the telephone andInternet costs associated with the business, and thecosts to insure the variety of elements mentioned.Examples of facility expenses include utility bills,vehicle fuel and repair bills, cell phone bills, busi-ness insurance bills, and property taxes.Ofce expense details the direct costs involved in running the business part of the practice. Thesecosts can be thought of as the expenses that areincurred that are separate from the direct delivery of patient care; costs that any business would requirejust to \"operate\" as a business that charges fees forservices. Ofce expense details the costs of provid-ing access to veterinary service, and collectingmoney. It includes costs to advertise and promotethe business, and expenses charged by bank ac-counts, credit card processers, and collection agen-cies. It also includes the cost of purchasingcomputer and general ofce supplies, postage andprinting costs and the fees paid to payroll compa-nies, accountants, and legal advisors. Labor expense includes all the costs of employ- ing and supporting the employees of the practice.Wages make up the largest portion of this part ofthis practice expense, and include both the wagespaid to veterinarians and the wages paid to varioussupport staff. Payroll taxes, including FICA, Medi-care, state and federal unemployment insurance,and other mandatory state insurance programs re-lated to payroll make up an often overlooked butsignicant portion of labor costs. Other expensesrelating to practice labor costs include the costs ofworkers compensation insurance, professional lia-bility insurance, and expense related to employeecontinuing education. Finally, premiums paid bythe employer for employee health insurance pro-grams, and contributions made to employer spon-sored retirement plans round out the large amountof money that all practices spend on labor expense tocompensate their veterinary and support staff. Depreciation expense is a system that is used for accounting and tax purposes to spread out thecost of equipment and other xed assets over time.It requires a little accounting knowledge to under-stand. Unlike the other categories that involvepaying a bill from a bank account, depreciation ex-pense is a method of cost allocation, and the expenseentries for depreciation require accountant over-sight as well as management decisions related toprevailing tax laws and codes. Depreciation expense relates to the purchase of items known as \"xed assets,\" large purchases thatwill be used in the business for more than 1 year.Accountants vary in their guidelines for what equip-ment/items constitute a depreciable asset versussmall items that can be written off the year they arepurchased, but in general, any item that costs morethan a few hundred dollars that is expected to lastmore than a year is considered for the depreciationschedule. Fixed-asset categories of depreciableitems commonly used in equine practice include pro-fessional equipment (ultrasound machines, digitalradiology equipment, laboratory equipment, etc.),computer hardware and software, ofce equipment,furniture and xtures, facility maintenance equip-ment, and practice vehicles. Large practices mayalso have livestock (e.g., embryo transfer mares), 270 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEand buildings. Some may have leasehold or landimprovements as depreciable xed assets. The concept of \"straight-line\" (SL) depreciation relates to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules thatassign an annual portion of the original cost of theitem as an expense that approximates the ordinarywear or life span of that item. The concept can beunderstood by thinking about what happens when aset of truck tires is purchased. Assume for thisexample that this set of 4 tires cost $1000 and areexpected to last 50,000 miles. The tires aremounted on a truck that travels an average of10,000 miles per year. If the tire tread is inspectedeach year, it will be apparent that 20% of the treadhas worn away, thus the useful life of each tire hasreduced by 20%. Simple math predicts that thetires will need to be replaced in 5 years. If the tireswere a depreciable business asset, they would belisted as a \"5-year asset.\" Even though the tirescost $1000 up front, the practice would not be al-lowed to deduct the full amount paid for the tiresin the year they were purchased. Instead, the ac-counting system would make an entry of a $200expense every year for 5 years to reduce taxableincome by the amount of estimated wear and tear onthe asset. The costs of purchase would be \"recov-ered\" over the estimated life of the item. The Internal Revenue Service has rules that dictate the economic life of various types of xed assets for taxand accounting purposes. Most veterinary equip-ment purchases, computers and vehicles are classed as\"5-year assets\" by the IRS (meaning that the costs arerecovered over a span of 5 years), whereas ofce fur-niture and xtures are classed as \"7-year assets\" (costsare recovered over a span of 7 years). There are otherforms of accelerated depreciation that are involved inpractice nancial management, including so called\"bonus depreciation\" as outlined by Section 179 of theIRS tax code that are beyond the scope of this presen-tation, but the concept of SL depreciation is one thatevery practitioner should understand. Bookkeeping for depreciation expense is overseen by the practice accountant, but decisions on xed-assetpurchases as they relate to the percentage of practiceincome that a practice can afford to invest over time tokeep up with technology, replace broken or outdatedequipment, and offer advanced services are the re-sponsibility of the practice owner(s). In this lecture,the economics of arriving at a reasonable budget forinvestment in xed assets over time will be discussed;this budget results in a relatively xed and predictableamount of depreciation expense annually. Where Does Practice Income Go? All equine practices must take in at least severalhundred thousand dollars of income in order to de-liver patient services and compensate the ownersand employees. The largest practices take in sev-eral million dollars of income. These numbers areintimidating for the associate practitioner whoseprimary concern is clinical management of cases,and for relatively young veterinarians contemplat-ing practice ownership or compensation negotia-tions. But just as the concept of depreciation can besimplied by thinking about the tangible example oftread wear on a tire, the \"many zeroes\" of practicenance can be simplied by scaling the big numbersdown to an easily imagined level. Practices that take in hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars do it essentially one dollar at atime. Each dollar of income can be thought of as100 pennies. Attendees for this talk will confer insmall groups to arrive at an educated guess of \"howmany pennies\" of an imaginary dollar of income arespent on each of the categories listed above. Thefollowing worksheet can be used for attendees torecord their discussion group's best guess as to theallocation of how each 100 pennies of practice in-come is spent. After the groups present their \"bestguess\" of expense allocations, the actual allocationsfrom private practice data will be presented.

The data that will be displayed isdrawn from one practice, but is consistent with met-rics published or observed by professional analystswho have tracked expense statistics and net incomefrom a broad spectrum of equine practices. b,c Acknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri-nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

Dwyer, DVM Equine practice economics dictate that approximately 25\u00a2 out of every dollar of revenue that apractitioner generates are available to be spent on veterinary compensation. Veterinary compensa-tion costs include many elements beyond the W-2 wages in a paycheck, including expense associatedwith practice-sponsored benets and the costs of payroll taxes and payroll-associated insuranceprograms. The wage portion of veterinary compensation is often incentivized by bonus offerings thatare linked to revenue generated by the employee; these compensation agreements are called \"baseplus\" wage plans. Practice owners and associates will benet from studying the details of practiceeconomics as they relate to compensation agreements. Knowledge of the laws and limitations thatapply to a given employment situation will help both sides agree on fair and affordable compensationplans. Author's address: Genesee Valley \"compensate\" is derived from the Latinword, \"compensationem,\" which means a weightingof one thing against another, a balancing. In sim-ple terms, veterinarians employed by equine prac-tices spend their professional time providingveterinary goods and services to patients. The an-imal owner(s) pay the practice money in exchangefor those goods and services; this money is practiceincome. As was explained in the previous talk,practice income is spent in many different areas,including the cost of drugs and supplies, the costs ofsupport staff labor, and the costs involved in oper-ating an ofce, providing ambulatory or hospitalservices, and the cost of purchasing equipment andassets. The mathematics of practice economicsshow that for every dollar of revenue that an equinepractice takes in, a nite amount of money, approx-imately 23\u00a2 to 26\u00a2 (or 23% to 26% of practice reve-nue) is available for veterinary compensation. Themoney that is available for compensation is spentnot only on veterinary wages but also on a variety ofbenets and perquisites. The costs of compensa-tion also include the payroll-related taxes and insur-ance payments that the practice must pay to federaland state government agencies. Most equine veterinarians are not trained in eco- nomics or business during their education, thus areeasily overwhelmed when thinking about the dollarsinvolved in managing a practice, given that thenumbers quickly amount to hundreds of thousands,if not millions, of dollars. But any veterinarian canunderstand the tangible reality of a stack of 100pennies that adds up to a single dollar. This talkwill frame the elements of affordable and fair veteri-nary compensation by explaining how each dollar that 272 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE NOTESa practice spends on compensation actually breaksdown into pennies that are spent on W-2 wages, em-ployee benets, payroll taxes, and employment-relatedgovernment insurance programs. Armed with thisperspective, a system for tracking individual produc-tion income and relating it to a variable compensationprogram will be outlined. Compensation Has Many Elements Wages, or \"W-2 income\" as reported to the InternalRevenue Service, are the largest portion of veteri-nary compensation expense. Wages are paid to em-ployees in the form of regular paychecks that areissued on a weekly or biweekly basis. AdditionalW-2 income is paid out by some practices as bonuspaychecks that are linked to employee production orperformance, emergency service compensation, orissued as discretionary compensation by the practiceowners. Bonus compensation may be issued on amonthly, quarterly, or annual basis, depending onindividual contractual agreements. Practices vary in the benets and perquisites of- fered in their compensation packages, but commonnonwage benets include employer-paid portions ofhealth insurance premiums, employer contributionsto retirement accounts, and employer paid \"timeoff \"\u2014paid days that are used for vacation, holidays,or family or medical leave. Most practices offersome compensation for the employee's professionalcontinuing education costs and an allowance for pro-fessional association dues and veterinary license ex-pense. Equine practices that offer ambulatoryservices may allow and pay for limited personal useof a practice vehicle and may either provide a cellphone or subsidize a portion of the costs of phoneand Internet usage. Many practices offer a dis-count on veterinary goods and services that are pur-chased for personally owned animals, or subsidize aportion of the costs of veterinary medical insurancepolicies. The largest sums that practices spend on em- ployee benets go toward health insurance premi-ums, contributions to retirement plans, and payingfor the costs of continuing education, but the costs ofother perquisites such as association dues and dis-counts on veterinary services are not inconsequen-tial. An example of representative total dollarcosts of common annual benets and perquisitesfrom a sample practice is listed in Table 1. Thesums listed are discretionary so they vary from onepractice to the next, but the numbers in the table arereflective of the costs of benets commonly reportedin budgets of prominent equine practices. For every dollar that is paid to a veterinarian as direct W-2 wages, the additional costs that a prac-tice spends on such benets and perquisites caneasily exceed 15\u00a2. Getting back to the \"big num-bers\" involved in practice nance, this means thatfor every $100,000 of practice income that a practicespends on W-2 wages of employed associate veteri-narians, an additional $15,000 is commonly spent onbenet programs for those team members. In ad-dition, a portion of the W-2 wages that are paid outreflect \"paid time off \" (PTO): days that are used forvacation or sick leave. Employees should realizethat such PTO is an additional benet that the prac-tice provides, and that the cost of such PTO must befactored into any discussion of compensation. Payroll tax costs and the expense of mandatory insurance programs that are based on W-2 wagescomprise another signicant element of the costs ofcompensation. Depending on the state of employ-ment, these costs may exceed 11\u00a2 for every dollarspent on W-2 wages. Table 2 outlines the current(2017) costs of payroll taxes that go to support theFederal FICA (Social Security) and Medicare pro-grams as well as employer costs levied by New YorkState (where the author's practice is located) forvarious mandatory programs. The mandatory pro-grams will vary by state. The payroll taxes andinsurance costs listed in this table are automaticallydeducted from the practice bank account with eachpayroll cycle. For every dollar that is spent on W-2 wages, note that more than an additional 11\u00a2 are spent on theseprograms. This means that for every $100,000 dol-lars that are paid to employees as wages, approxi-mately $11,500 of additional practice money is spenton mandatory Federal and State payroll taxes and Table 1.

These aretrue \"costs of compensation\" as these programs werecreated for the benet of the employees over theirlife span. The programs are in place to act as -nancial repositories that will provide compensationto the employee from the government in the event ofretirement, unemployment, medical needs in oldage, disability, or workplace injury. Employee Payroll Taxes, Income Taxes, and ElectedPre-Tax Payroll Deductions Payroll taxes are levied on individual employees aswell as employers. In fact, employees pay exactlythe same number of pennies to the government forFICA (Social Security) and Medicare that employersdo! This money is withheld automatically from theemployee's paycheck and is deposited to the respec-tive government account. Thus out of every $1.00of W-2 wage that is paid from the practice to theemployee, the government withholds 6.20\u00a2 for socialsecurity and 1.45\u00a2 for Medicare from the employee,so each \"dollar of pay\" is thus reduced to a 92.45\u00a2cash before any other withholdings. Employeesalso may see entries for minor withholdings fromtheir paycheck for other state mandated programsfor disability or unemployment. Beginning in2018, many employees may see additional deduc-tions subtracted due to recently implemented lawsrelating to the expansion of \"Family and MedicalLeave\" compensation programs. In addition to payroll taxes, all employees must pay annual federal income taxes and many states(including the author's state of New York) assessincome taxes as well. Employees who receive W-2wages have an amount that approximates the pre-dicted taxes that will be owed on each dollar ofpayroll deducted from the gross pay issued at everypaycheck as income tax \"withholdings.\" Thisamount is paid to the respective government entitiesand then the total is reconciled every year when theindividual les their tax return; in some cases addi-tional money is owed to the government and othercases the government owes the individual a refund.The amount that is withheld from the paycheck isbased on marital status, the number of dependentsthat will be claimed by the employee on their taxreturn, as well as the applicable tax bracket that isanticipated for the annual wages of the employee.Individual circumstances and the state of residencewill dictate the amount of income tax that is withheldfrom an employee's paycheck, but the amount oftenexceeds 15% to 20%, or 15\u00a2 to 20\u00a2 of every dollar. In today's nancial world the cost of the two larg- est workplace benets are rarely borne entirely bythe employer. A portion of the employee healthinsurance premiums are commonly paid by the em-ployee, and employer retirement plan contributionsfor plans such as 401Ks or SIMPLE IRA accountsare usually matched to voluntary contributionselected by the employee. In addition, many em-ployees may choose to allocate a portion of theirpaycheck to allocate some income to tax advantagedprograms such as health savings accounts. Most ofthese voluntary employee costs can be paid for with\"pre-tax dollars.\" This means that the payrolltaxes that were outlined above are taken out of theincome that is \"left over\" after deductions have beenmade for the elected benet program(s). An exam-ple of how \"pre-tax\" dollars might be earmarked forbenet programs from a dollar of a typical paycheckis outlined in Table 3. The second column of the Table 2.

The combined FICA and Medicare taxes on 90\u00a2 of payroll for the employee who opts for pre-tax deduc-tions are $0.068; the taxes on $1.00 of payroll for theemployee who does not opt for deductions are$0.077. Electing to pay the employee portion of thebenets cited in the previous example would resultin payroll tax savings of $90 for every $10,000 ofgross pay, or a savings of approximately $675 inFICA and Medicare payroll taxes on an annual W-2income of $75,000. The total effect on FICA andMedicare taxes in this example is a savings of ap-proximately 10%; the effect that similar deductionswould have on other income taxes varies with indi-vidual circumstances and state. The Reality of a Paycheck: Key Numbers to Understand The mandatory costs that both employer and em-ployee pay for payroll taxes have been explained inthe previous section, and the advantages realizedwhen employees elect to pay their portion of certainemployment programs through deductions of pre-tax payroll dollars have been outlined above. Thecosts that all employers pay to provide common ben-ets and perquisites have also been described.These \"bare facts\" of mean that nomatter whether $1, or $100, or $10,000 are spent bythe practice on associate W-2 payroll wages, theoriginal amount does NOT translate to equal addi-tions to the employee wallet, or equal subtractionsfrom the practice bank account! There are a num-ber of \"hidden costs\" of compensation as describedpreviously. Both employees (veterinary associates)and employers (practice owners) must understandthe \"reality of a paycheck,\" which can be summa-rized as follows: For every dollar of W-2 wage that is paid to an associate out of practice income revenues: 1. The employee (associate veterinarian) takes home 25% to 30% LESS cash, depending onincome taxes, employee payroll taxes, and pre-tax W-2 compensation that the employee ear-marks to spend on benets such as retirementsavings, health insurance, or a health savingsaccount. 2. The employer (practice) spends 25% to 30% MORE cash, depending on the amount paidout for employer payroll taxes, government-mandated insurance programs linked to pay-roll, and the costs of practice-benet programsand perquisites. Employers and employees who keep these \"simplenancial facts of life\" in mind during compensationdiscussions will be at an advantage when negotiat-ing a compensation agreement that is affordable tothe practice and fair for both parties.The other \"essential fact\" that all parties must understand is that equine practices can afford tospend approximately 25% of practice income on thetotal costs of compensation paid out for veterinarywork. The exact number may vary a few percent-age points up or down given the scope or size of thepractice, but this \"25% rule\" is a useful \"stake in theground\" that should be kept in mind when budgetingfor practice labor expense or entering compensationnegotiations. That gure represents the full cost ofcompensation, including wages, benets, perqui-sites, payroll taxes, and employment-related insur-ance costs. W-2 Wage Compensation for Veterinary Associates\u2014HowAre Wages Paid? Recent survey dataapolling veterinarians from all arms of the veterinary profession suggests that ap-proximately 25% of veterinarians are paid a straightannual salary, another 27% are paid strictly on pro-duction, and the remaining 48% are paid through ahybrid method that combines a guaranteed basesalary with a production incentive. The latter com-pensation scheme is often termed a \"base plus\" plan. Veterinarians who are paid W-2 wages through a straight salary arrangement know that their wagesfor a given scal year of employment will be a setamount. The compensation terms are often spelledout in a contract agreement. A certain salaryamount is agreed to be paid out for a certain timeinterval, usually a year, but sometimes broken downinto a weekly or monthly sum. W-2 wage compen-sation for any subsequent year that follows is nego-tiated between the employer and the employee.The employer may base decisions on changes in com-pensation on the length of tenure the employee haswith the practice, on practice protability, on theindividual income that is produced by the employee,on team or individual performance metrics or bysome combination of these analytics. The employeemay negotiate for changes in the base salary insequential years by citing measurable performancemetrics that have been met or by some othercriteria. Veterinarians who are paid W-2 wages that are based solely on income production receive variablepay, depending on the amount of income that iscollected in a specied period. The practice man-agement and accounting software tracks the incomethat the individual bills for and collects, and theveterinarian's paycheck is adjusted at regular inter-vals, based on the income that is generated. Inmany practices the pre-agreed W-2 wage amountthat is linked to collected veterinary service incomeis different than the W-2 wage amount that is linkedto the sale of veterinary products. The amount ofmonetary compensation linked to veterinary ser-vices is higher than that linked to product sales,because recent changes in the delivery and cost ofdrugs and certain supplies has reduced the prot-ability of product sales. In large practices, the pro- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 275THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEduction income that is paid to hospital cliniciansand/or specialists may be based on a scale that isdifferent than that used for ambulatory clinicians. Veterinarians who are paid on a hybrid \"base plus\" compensation agreement are guaranteed abase W-2 wage that is specied as an annual,weekly, or monthly salary. This base amount ispaid out no matter what level of income productionis generated by the employee. However, the com-pensation agreement promises the employee addi-tional compensation if a certain performancethreshold is exceeded. The most common perfor-mance threshold is a specied amount of collectedincome within a set time period. That period maybe tracked monthly, quarterly, or annually. Veter-inarians who enter into employment agreementswith relatively low base salaries may be eligible forbonus checks on a monthly or quarterly basis. Vet-erinarians who have agreements with relativelyhigh base salaries may only be eligible for an annualbonus check. In either case, if the individual gen-erates income for the practice that exceeds the spec-ied threshold, the employee can realize signicantincreases in take home pay. Veterinarians whoqualify for bonus payments usually reach theirthreshold income goals through a combination ofwell-honed clinical skills, increased efciency, andne-tuned skills in client relations that promote re-peat business and loyalty. The main advantage of a straight salary compen- sation method is that it provides a xed income thatis guaranteed. This method is often used for newhires or young associates who are still cultivatingtheir clinical skill set and efciency. Disadvan-tages to the employee include the risk of being un-derpaid for the contribution that is being made tothe practice. The employer, on the other hand,risks overpaying a poorly producing employee byguaranteeing a salary that may exceed the employeecontribution to the practice nancial picture. Advantages of wages that are strictly based on production are that \"pay\" is linked to actual practiceincome, which can be enhanced through effort on theemployee's part, including enhanced clinical skills,increased efciency, and the cultivation of clientloyalty. Thus, the employee has a lot of controlover the outcome, but as compensation expense isdirectly linked to actual revenue, the system pro-tects the employer from paying too much. There isno \"ceiling\" for the total sum that can be earned bythe employee beyond the volume of services that thepractitioner can realistically provide and the feesthat the practice charges for those services. How-ever, living on pay based solely on production can be challenging due to the seasonal nature ofequine practice, which always includes a \"slowtime\" where income lags and the resultant W-2income for the associate would be low. Various hybrid \"base plus\" compensation methods have become common in equine practice becausethey provide the comfort and steady cash flow of aguaranteed weekly or biweekly paycheck, yet alsooffer the incentive of extra pay for high-performingemployees. Although any production-based com-pensation method can foster unhealthy competitionwhere team members volley for clients, cases, andincome, practices that craft thoughtful \"base plus\"compensation schedules can create agreements thatreward individual excellence and efciency withoutundermining collegial teamwork and cooperation. Clarifying Compensation Expectations Whatever compensation method is agreed on be-tween employer and employee, the specics shouldbe spelled out in writing. The various elementsincluding wages, benets, and perquisites that thepractice offers are outlined for a given employmentperiod, usually 1 year. Whether in the form of acontract or an employment offer, documentation ofcompensation terms should be clear and specic.Prior to renewal of any employment agreement, bothemployer and employee should sit down and discusscompensation so that both are \"on the same page\" asto how and when the various costs of compensationwill be paid out. The employee should be updatedabout opportunities available for participation invarious pre-tax payroll deduction programs. Bothemployer and employee should be clear on issuessuch as license and dues renewal, and cell phoneusage, and the details of options for retirement andhealth plan contributions, and discounts on servicesfor personal animals must be discussed. Registra-tion and travel costs for continuing education, aswell as time off for vacation, medical or family leaveshould be clearly understood. In a nutshell, thepractice should \"say what it is going to do, and dowhat it says!\" The employee should have a clear picture of what money and benets the practice has promised andshould not be surprised by any allotments of time,resources, or money as the year unfolds and thevarious elements of compensation are paid out.The employee should also have a good grasp of theexpectations that the practice has for their contri-bution to the business. Associates and practiceowners both benet from well-designed, regular re-ports that share data on the costs of compensationas well as individual production gures that trackhow well W-2 wages and benet costs are linked tothe economic value that the employee provides tothe practice. Using Practice Financial Data to Track Production During more than 2 decades of practice ownership,the author has drafted a variety of \"base plus\" com-pensation agreements that provide guaranteed baseand incentivized bonus W-2 wages as well as a va-riety of benets to the veterinarians that haveworked within the practice. The lecture will show amethod that this practice has used to give feedbackto employees on the cost of their compensation.This method tracks income production on an indi- 276 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEvidual basis monthly, quarterly, and annually anddetails the cost of W-2 wages, various benets andperquisites on a similar basis. It provides a run-ning \"meter\" for both employer and employee totrack progress toward set goals of collected incomeproduction. The metrics used take the seasonal na-ture of equine practice into account, yet still providea barometer to predict whether a set goal is likely tobe met or not. One nal comment on setting production thresh- olds for \"base plus\" compensation strategies: a va-riety of approaches can work, but it is important forboth employer and employee to be careful in calcu-lating the costs/outcomes of various \"what-if \" sce-narios. The key fact to keep in mind is that a practice can afford to spend approximately 25% ofthe income an individual generates on direct veteri-nary compensation costs . Some practices may optto pay a bit more, some a bit less, depending ondesired prot and other factors, but no practice canafford to pay costs of compensation that total a lot more than 25% of income generated.

Author's address: the business of veterinary medicine, partner-ship with other veterinarians can create opportu-nity for growth in many ways. The synergies,access to capital, and economies of scale created byan expansion through partnership can make it adesirable option for growing your practice. Sev-eral forms of partnership exist, not only the tra-ditional partnering of two or more veterinarians,but also partnerships in a broader sense includingpotential mergers of two or more practices andcorporate partnership opportunities. When eval-uating a potential partnership, or examining anexisting partnership, of priority is the need for amethodical examination as to why the partnershipis necessary, what benets it presents, what risksit could entail, and whether the expectations ofthe partnership have been thoroughly communi-cated to all stakeholders. In any business, thealignment of values, a carefully selected leader-ship structure, and a solid legal foundation will beof value in setting the stage for a prosperous en-vironment. This presentation will focus on thesethree elements of successful business manage-ment as it applies to today's landscape of veteri-nary partnership opportunities.2. Strategic Alignment Mergers and partnerships in business have beenhappening since the beginning of trade. Here inthe Americas, European trappers strategically alignedthemselves with various Indian tribes during the17th-century fur trade in an effort to lay claim totrapping grounds, protect waterways, and ultimatelyavail themselves of the potential to receive greaterreturn for their efforts. And why not? We all wantthe maximum benet from our time and labor. Ifpartnering can create an advantage, or ensure asmoother road, it is natural to explore the possibilities. In the healthcare industries we have seen a signi- cant change in the mid-to-late 1900s from the one-doctor practices making house calls, to doctor-ownedhospitals, to the onslaught of partnership venturesincluding investor-owned healthcare organizations. As similar concepts took root in the veterinary industry, we have seen the growth of organizationssuch as VCA and Baneld create signicant corpo-rate footprints in the marketplace. This yearbrought about the acquisition of VCA by Mars Cor-poration (owners of Baneld), collectively represent-ing nearly 16% of the market 12.6% of the veterinaryjob force. 1In the equine veterinary marketplace we are beginning to see the shift as well. Joint 278 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE NOTESventures and corporate partnerships are being ex-plored with more interest than ever before. Regardless of the type of expansion you seek through a potential partnership, the key elements ofexamining any such venture are the same. Doesthis make sense nancially and can I prosper in thisnew environment? Do we share the same values?Does the leadership structure make sense? Andhow best to establish our legal framework to protecteveryone's interest in the long term? 3. Understanding What Partnership Means Partnerships are explored for one reason: an in-crease in return. Be it more time or more money,we want something more and the option of a part-nership holds that promise of return. With risk cancome reward. And partnering always carries somedegree of risk. Why? Because you are givingsomething up in the hopes of gain and the outcome isunknown. The laws of nature demand that whenyou choose to do one thing, you are in effect choosingnot to do something else. So for all of the gain thatpartnership represents, what is it that could be lost?Two things: money and control. Two things nearand dear to the heart of every current or futurebusiness owner. Regardless of how the partnership is structured, you will now be making decisions with someone elseinvolved. Even in a 50/50 partnership deal, therewill be an alpha. If you have been the sole owner,or majority owner of a practice and are bringing ona partner or looking at a partnership opportunity,your level of control will now be shared in some way.Can you accept that? Do you know what it means?How can you prepare for this inevitable change,and even more importantly, make it work to youradvantage? 4. Maintaining Your Heading Your career up to this point has likely been in align-ment with deeply held personal values. Considerwhat you value above all the rest and how thosevalues are manifest in your business? Do you valueprotability? Do you value culture? Is it havinga name in the industry? Position in the market-place? When you consider Maslow's hierarchy ofhuman needs, you'll nd that there is a similarpyramid in business. First there is the basic needof the business to support itself, to generate enoughcash flow to stay afloat. Next, the business needs toachieve some measure of protability along somemeaningful timeline in order to sustain itself longterm. But after that, it gets interesting. Mostbusinesses that have been in business over 5 yearshave demonstrated an ability to generate cash flowand to produce a prot. But the differences becomestaggering after that simple test. Are they fun placesto be? Is there much turnover? Do the employeesfeel valued? Empowered? Are there systems inplace to ensure longevity? And what of the long-term vision for the owners? What exit strategiesare they exploring? Are we in business to makemoney, or are we trying to right some fundamentalwrong in the world? Is there a culture, and what isit, and why? You can get a cup of coffee at Star-bucks or the Waffle House, but that is the likely theonly similarity in these two enterprises. Why?Culture and values. What are yours? In the business world you'll hear a lot about in- creasing protability. Financial advisors will oftentalk about EBIDA (earnings before interest depreci-ation and amortization), which is simply a truermeasurement of prot before deducting the above.It is an exercise to determine how much is left overduring a specically selected time period. It is im-portant because that gap is an indication of how thatbusiness is judged by the world. But how much arethey putting back into the company to develop thekind of culture that they want. How much is beingspent on enriching the workplace so that everybodyloves coming to work in that environment? Howmuch is spent on recruitment, staff development,team building, internal customer service, and givingback? I have seen businesses that could easily beat 20% prot margins, and by choice they are oper-ating at around 9% simply because they have madeit a priority to put money back into building a cul-ture where they can thrive. Why? They valuesomething else. They may still have their eye onbusiness value, long-term ability to sell their shares,and retire, but they see the path between here andthere differently. And it's not necessarily all abouta number. It's about a feeling. About an atmo-sphere of abundance and wellbeing, it might beabout peace and fulllment and the individual per-ception of what brings peace and fulllment to fru-ition. And let's not forget ... 9% of a billion is awhole lot more than 20% of a million. Partners need to be on the same page in that regard. These expectations of cash flow, of prot-ability, expected key performance indicators (KPIs),and of corporate culture are crucial discussions thatneed to take place at the outset of the partnership.Without these areas being thoroughly explored anddened, the alignment is likely doomed from thebeginning. The denition of each partner's successneeds to at minimum be communicated to the othersso that the rest of the partners are on notice of whateach partner requires in order to be fullled as aprofessional and ultimately to consider the partner-ship a successful venture. 5. Selecting the Captain and Crew Partnership discussions usually begin with the thrustbeing nancial gain. This is an obvious driver and itmakes sense that greater wealth be the result. As the numbers are evaluated and the potentialsynergies explored, the \"doing of it\" will ultimatelytake over as a crucial factor. Similar to a marriage,the dating period can be intoxicating, the wedding amassive celebration, and the honeymoon completebliss. But then the work starts. Someone needs to AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 279THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEsweep the floor, take out the trash, manage thenances, and so forth. It is no different in themerging of practices or the growth of a partnership.Someone has to be in charge. Too often this discus-sion of authority is treated lightly with a sense ofentitlement based on years in the profession, whohas more seniority, whose practice is worth more, orwho does a better job of selling themselves as theobvious choice during the negotiation phase. Leadership The skills required for getting a job and the skillsrequired for actually doing a job are not usually thesame thing. In 1969 a satirical little book was pub-lished by Laurence J. Peter that the world wouldcome to know as the Peter principle. It is a conceptstating that the selection of a candidate for a posi-tion is often based on the candidate's performance intheir current role, rather than on abilities relevantto the intended role. 2In other words, the fact that an owner of a practice seems to have been successfulbased on a set of nancials is not necessarily anindicator that they will be successful steering theship when the organization changes culture, doublesin size, introduces a new set of players, requiresmore systems, etc. This is important as new asso-ciates join the partnership realm or when practicesjoin forces. Determinations need to be made as towho will have managing roles, who will simply beequity owners, and how that leadership structure isto function. Confusion or surprises after the paper-work is done will lead to mistrust, disappointment,and turf wars that can result in a failed effort. In addition, owners of practices are typically the original founders of that practice and as such can beprime candidates for founder's syndrome, or found-eritis. This is a popular term for a difculty facedby organizations where one or more founders main-tain disproportionate power and influence followingthe effective initial establishment of the project,leading to a wide range of problems for both theorganization and those involved in it. 3The passion and charisma of the founder or founders, which wassuch an important reason for the successful estab-lishment of the organization, becomes a limiting anddestructive force rather than the creative and pro-ductive one it was in the early stages. 3Leaders suffering from this malady often view themselves asindispensable to the organization, they feel entitled,and do not trust anyone to do the job quite as well asthey would have done it. This presents a signicant challenge for practice owners joining forces. Personalities, egos, and lackof an in-depth look at the governance structure andleadership chain of command can create serious is-sues for joint ventures. Be cognizant of this likelyobstacle and be prepared to address it early in thegame to avoid the conflicts it represents, and theeventual loss of trust it can create.Systems Most veterinarians are technical people, they under-stand technical viewpoints and technical approachesto solving problems. Technical people are very adeptat running a clinic. They may not be as adept atrunning a business. They are likely very ill equippedto run an enterprise. 4 As described in Peter Gerber's book, The E-Myth , the most vital component of establishing a success-ful enterprise is the implementation of successfulsystems and the art of managing those systemsrather than managing people. Veterinary medi-cine lends itself well to being run according to sys-tems, to given protocol, and a set of standardoperating procedures. When the systems are inplace, it is simply a matter of monitoring the successof each system, measuring for improvement, andadjusting as necessary over time. Without sys-tems, the ship is inclined to get seriously off coursein a very short time as the leadership of the part-nership becomes a quagmire of conflicting opinions,egos, and personalities. When the systems are de-ned, agreed upon, and implemented, the likelihoodof things staying on track is greatly enhanced. Recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of your potential partners and understanding the leader-ship role (if any) that each partner is to have in theoverall scheme of the business structure will ensurethe greatest opportunity for success. The selectionof the right leadership structure and the systemsthat will be implemented to run the organizationwill likely have the greatest impact on the futuresuccess of the business, given that it will have mas-sive influence on the level of trust and transparencywithin the organization, the level of open communi-cation that is enjoyed and ultimately the core func-tionality of the executive team. Get this piece rightand you can survive almost anything. Get it wrongand the partnership is doomed. Do not overlook itsimportance and the impact of its long-term effects. 6. Building a Legal Foundation To put your business in good stead, seek out a goodattorney that understands the veterinary landscape.You would be surprised how specialized this areatruly is. Considering the complexity of non-compete provisions, the valuation methodology you select forthe sale of future interests in the company, and therestrictions on transferability that are consideredindustry norms for veterinary medicine, you willwant to work with someone who understands theindustry. Below is a checklist of the key legal ele-ments that will position your practice well. Know who your attorney is representing. Does he represent you? You and your partner com- bined? The organization? Or all three? Andare you happy with that? Ask your attorneyto describe the representation from the outset.It is a common mistake for all partners to 280 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEconsider the attorney as \"their lawyer\" only tolearn later that he was really looking out forthe interests of one stakeholder. What ismore, you do not want to be paying the bill forsomeone who is not looking out for your inter- ests. Make sure there is an appropriateengagement letter that spells out the repre-sentation so that you have assurance thatyour personal interests are being looked af-ter by a legal professional. Make sure you get input on entity selection, giving consideration to how the partnershipwill be taxed. You will want to consult yourtax advisor to give you guidance in this area toavoid any unnecessary double taxation. Con-sider whether you wish to be taxed at the en-tity level or flow through to the partnersindividually? Is this the best tax structure foryou personally? Would you rather see it han-dled differently? Remember, at the beginning is the time to ask questions and voice con-cerns. Once things are written and signed, al-though usually they are capable of beingamended, it is always more difcult and morecostly to rewrite the rules. Understand the signicance of your corporate formalities. LLCs vs corporations, vs part-nerships, there are different requirements foreach. Failure to adhere to these agreed-uponformalities can be problematic, particularly inthe event of a lawsuit. You will also need to openly agree upon what type of corporate formalities will be ac-cepted. The frequency of meetings, the placeand method of notication of meetings, andwhat will be expected at the annual meeting. How will the partnership be managed? Mem- ber managed? Manager managed? Boardmanaged? There are different rules and dif-ferent forms of management based on the statethat you live in. Be sure you read this care-fully as you want to make sure your initialunderstanding is what is being agreed to onpaper. Designate who has rights to what in-formation and how that information can beaccessed. Voting percentages are key to management and control. If yours is meant to be an equalpartnership with each partner having equalsay in all matters, make sure this is ade-quately described. At the same time, be surethat along with the percentage of ownershipdescribed, the contribution that merits thatpercentage of ownership needs to be detailedwith specicity. Avoid any generalized termsor vague language when it comes to initialcontributions. Finally, when addressing vot-ing rights make sure you understand if alldecisions will be the determination of the man-ager and that you understand who the manag-er(s) are. Know what types of decisions requirea majority, a supermajority, and unanimousconsent. Many partnerships start out as twopartners in a 50/50 deal, but soon expand toinclude more partners over time. The morecomplete and correct your agreement is in thebeginning, the less chance for errors and thelower costs you will incur regarding necessarychanges to your company agreement. How will we address a deadlock in manage- ment? In a 50/50 partnership, how do wemove pass a voting tie? Mediation? Cointoss? Turtle race? Understand capital contributions. What is con- sidered capital and who will contribute what andwhen? Will capital calls be permitted? Who canmake a capital call? What are the triggeringevents? How much more money can you be re-quired to come up with? And in what time-frame? Will the partnership be maintainingcapital accounts? Spell out what you expect in terms of nancials and the frequency with which you expect toreview them, (P&L, statement of cash flows,and balance sheets). Also, discuss what ac-counting method you will be using (cash vsaccrual). How distributions will be addressed, tax distri- butions, limitations on distributions. These areall questions that must be answered as you en-tertain your partnership. Make sure your agreement has an indemni- cation clause stating that members are indem-nied by company for acts done in good faithwithin their authority. Transfer of ownership is of utmost importance. What rules will your partnership have regard-ing transferability? And what triggeringevents should be considered (death, divorce,etc.)? Include provisions for rst rights of re-fusal along with appropriate time periods,methodology, spousal consents acknowledgingthe arrangement. How will the practice be valued? Is there an agreed upon price? If so, how long will it holdas being an accurate value for the prac-tice? Beyond that, or in absence of, how willvalue be determined? By whom? And in theevent of a sale, what payment terms will beacceptable? The more of this you have ironedout in your partnership agreement, the lesslikely there will be a signicant dispute aboutthe methodology when the time arrives tomake that determination. Include important non-compete provisions to protect the practice from future competitionshould a partner sell his interest and thenlater decide to set up shop in the vicinity. Determine who has the authority to amend the agreement, and how that amendment can bemade. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 281THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEIn the event of a dispute, what resolution mea- sures will be considered? Will you choose litiga- tion, mediation, arbitration, or arm wrestle? Doyou know the difference? Make sure you include language as to who can consent to winding up and other triggeringfactors, such as bankruptcy or judicial decreethat may bring about the end of business for agiven entity. There are many details to consider, which is whyhaving a good attorney well versed in industry stan-dards and norms is of benet to any potential part-nership in the veterinary space. Your interest in aveterinary practice is your livelihood throughoutyour professional career and is likely your retire-ment plan as well. Treat it carefully and protect itvigilantly from a legal standpoint. Be diligent inyour compliance with your organizational bylaws.By participating in making the rules, not only do youknow what the rules are, but you have an opportu-nity to be heard on the front end of any organizationissue while still in the honeymoon phase. Once yousign them as an owner and likely and ofcer ormanager, they are truly your promise to the com-pany that you will carry the torch meticulously onbehalf of the welfare of the organization. Yourcommitment to the acknowledgments you make willbear dividends down the road when you positionyourself to accept distributions, bring on new part-ners, and sell some or all of your interest in thecompany. 7. Conclusion In today's world diversity is rather en vogue. Themore different something is, the more it ts withsociety's expectations. Not everyone sees the worldthe same and while our society celebrates this as agood thing, it is not necessarily great advice forbusiness partners. Yes, we are all individuals withdifferent viewpoints, and not only do we not see itthe same today, but our viewpoint changes over theyears. What we perceive as being important todaymay become secondary to other things in the future.Aligning yourself with an organization or individu-al(s) with \"like\" values, carefully selecting a leader-ship/governance structure and implementing a solidlegal foundation will collectively achieve one thing ... it will establish the expectations. Expectationscommunicated and effectively managed, will lead toprosperity. As important as you knowing why you are inter- ested in a partnership and what your values andperceptions are with regard to the partnership is theobligation to communicate these things to your part-ner(s) so that they know where you are coming from,why you are involved in the deal, and to make surethat you understand their viewpoint in return. It has been said that good fences make good neigh- bors. Fences establish boundaries; the expectationthat you can come this far ... but no further. As youconsider your values and communicate them, youare establishing these expectations. As you explorethe leadership structure of the partnership and thepotential systems that will be employed, again theexpectations are being made known. Even if you donot get your way all the time, it is important to askthese questions and have these conversations at theoutset, to avoid a miscommunication down the roadthat can lead to mistrust. Bear in mind those lead-ership pitfalls of the Peter principle, founders syndrome, and the importance of having and man-agement systems as described in the E-Myth .A s these areas are explored and discussed, you willunveil a multitude of important factors to be consid-ered as you establish your legal foundation, whichwill lay the groundwork for many of the partnershipexpectations. When the key areas I have outlined have been discussed and decisions made after thoughtful con-sideration of everyone's view point, you will have amuch greater chance at having a successful partner-ship venture. Perhaps the most famous case in demonstrating the power of expectations is that of the \"experi-menter expectancy effect\" as was performed by Dr.Rosenthal in 1963 when he took two groups of ratsand examined the ability of each group to learn tonavigate through a maze. But it was not the ratsthat were being examined, rather, it was the \"exam-iner\" and their influence on the outcome based onwhat they had been led to believe. Rosenthal hadtwo groups of students test the rats, wrongly inform-ing them that one group of rats had been speciallybred to be \"maze dull\" and the other was \"mazebright.\" In reality, all rats were standard lab rats,and were randomly assigned to the \"dull\" and\"bright\" conditions. The results showed that therats labeled as \"bright\" learned the mazes more quickly than those labeled as \"dull.\" 5Apparently, students had unconsciously influenced the perfor-mance of their rats, depending on what they hadbeen told. The lesson in this experiment is that the expecta- tion determined the result. It is no different inpartnerships. When expectations are dened andcommunicated, they are more likely to be met.When partners know what to expect, when theycommunicate with transparency, when they do notsurprise one another, they better position them-selves to expect success.

Introduction The purpose of this paper is to give some generalinformation regarding nancial statements and theinformation they can provide about a practice.This paper will provide an overview of nancialstatements using a ctitious practice. This prac-tice has been named Mega Valley Equine Hospital(MVEH). The actual numbers come for the combi-nation of over 30 equine practices from around thecountry so the numbers and trends are representa-tive of what can have been seen in any practice.There has been, in no way, an attempt to verify theaccuracy of the information and it has simply beenused in the computations and analysis. Financial reporting refers to the way companies show their nancial performance to investors, cred-itors, and other interested parties by preparing andpresenting nancial statements. Financial report-ing summarizes a practice's operating activities (thepractice's ordinary business), investing activities(purchasing, selling, and disposing of long-term as-sets), and nancing activities (raising and repayingcapital). The role of nancial-statement analysisis to use the information in a company's nancialstatements, along with other relevant information,to make economic decisions. Stakeholders use -nancial statement data to evaluate a company's pastperformance and current nancial position to formopinions about the company's ability to earn protsand generate cash flow in the future. Generally,nancial-statement analysis uses the following -nancial statements: income statement, statementof cash flows, and balance sheet. This paper is organized based on the nancial state- ments. There is a separate section for each of thebasic nancial reports contained within a comprehen-sive set of nancial statements, Income Statement,Cash Flow Statement, and Balance Sheet. Each sep-arate report section (Income Statement, Cash FlowStatement, and Balance Sheet) has some general in-formation about what these reports contain and howthey can be used to manage your business. After thenancial statements reports, it will provide informa-tion regarding certain nancial ratios created from thenancial statements. These ratios are calculatedbased on the Income Statement and Balance Sheet. Finally, this paper contains an analysis of the value of MVEH. There has been no examination ofthe data for accuracy, and therefore no one can at-test to the information provided. 2. Income Statement The income statement reports on the nancial perfor-mance of your practice over a period of time. Inves-tors examine the practice's income statement forvaluation purposes while lenders examine the incomestatement for information about the practice's abilityto make the promised interest and principal payments 284 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE NOTESon its debt. The basic income statement equation is:Revenue - Expenses /H11005Net Income. Therefore, the elements of the income statement include revenues,expenses, and gains and losses. Revenues are inflows from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or other activities that con-stitutes the practice's ongoing major or central opera-tions. Revenues are categorized by sales, gains, andinvestment income. Expenses are outflows from de-livering or producing goods and services that consti-tute the practice's ongoing major or central operations.Expenses are categorized by cost of goods sold; selling,general, expenses; depreciationand amortization; tax expense; andlosses. Gains and losses are increases and decreasesin equity or net assets from peripheral or incidentaltransactions outside the practice's primary businessactivities. The income statement can be summarizedas follows: Gross Revenue (Cost of Goods Sold)Gross Profit (Operating Expense)Operating Profit (Interest Expense)Income Before Tax (Tax Expense)Net Income Gross prot is the amount that remains after thedirect costs of producing a product or service aresubtracted from revenue. By subtracting operatingexpenses, such as selling, general and administra-tive expenses, and depreciation from gross protresults in operating prot. By subtracting interestexpense and income taxes from operation prot re-sults in the practice's net income. Under the ac-crual method of accounting, revenue is recognizedwhen earned and expenses are recognized when in-curred. The important point to remember is thataccrual accounting does not necessarily coincidewith the receipt or payment of cash. Consequently,practices can manipulate net income by recognizingrevenue earlier or later or by delaying or accelerat-ing the recognition of expenses. 3. Cash Flow Statement Analysis Given that the income statement is usually based onthe accrual method of accounting, net income maynot represent cash generated from operations. Acompany may be generating positive and growingnet income, but may be heading for insolvency be-cause insufcient cash is being generated fromoperating activities. The cash flow statement pro-vides information beyond that available from theincome statement, which may be based on accrual,rather than cash accounting. The cash flow statement reports on the practice's cash receipts and cash payments during an account-ing period. It provides information about a compa-ny's operating, investing, and nancing activitiesand an understanding of the impact of accrual ac-counting events on cash flows. The cash flow state-ment provides insight to assess the practice'sliquidity, solvency, and nancial flexibility. Ithelps to determine whether regular operations gen-erate enough cash to sustain the business, if enoughcash is generated to pay off existing debts as theymature, if the practice is likely to need additionalnancing, whether unexpected obligations can bemet, and whether the practice can take advantage ofnew business opportunities as they arise. Items on the cash flow statement come from income statement items and balance sheet items. A prac-tice's cash receipts and payments are classied on thecash flow statement as either operating activities, in-vesting activities, or nancing activities. Cash flow from operating activities consists of the inflows and outflows of cash resulting from transac-tions that affect a practice's net income. Examplesof operating activity inflows include cash collectedfrom customer and interest and dividends received.Examples of operating activity outflows include cashpaid to employees and suppliers, taxes paid, interestpaid, and cash paid for other expenses. Cash flow from investing activities consists of the inflows and outflows of cash resulting from the ac-quisition or disposal of long-term assets and certaininvestments. Examples of investing activity in-flows include sales proceeds from xed assets andprincipal received from loans made to others. Ex-amples of investing activity outflows include acqui-sitions of xed assets and loans made to others. Cash flow from nancing activities consists of the in- flows and outflows of cash resulting from transactionsaffecting a practice's capital structure. Examples of -nancing activity inflows include proceeds from issuingstock and principal amounts of debt issued. Examplesof nancing activity outflows include principal paid ondebt and dividends paid to shareholders. The cash flow statement reconciles the beginning and ending balances of cash over an accounting period.The change in cash is a result of the practice's operat-ing, investing and nancing activities as follows: Operating cash flow /H11001Investing cash flow /H11001Financial cash flow Change in cash balance /H11001Beginning cash balance Ending cash balance AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 285THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEIt is important to understand that net income basedon accrual accounting is not the same thing as cashearnings. When the timing of revenue or expenserecognition differs from the receipt or payment ofcash, it is reflected in changes in balance sheetsitems. Just keep in mind that a practice's balancesheet, income statement, and cash flow statementare all related. 4. Balance Sheet Analysis Although the income statement presents a pictureof a practice's economic activities over a period oftime, the balance sheet reports the practice's nan-cial position at a point in time. The balance sheetis important to investors and lenders alike. Thebalance sheet consists of three elements: assets,liabilities, and owner's equity. Transactions aremeasured so that the fundamental accounting equa-tion holds: Assets /H11005Liabilities /H11001Owner's Equity or Assets /H11005Liabilities /H11001Contributed Capital /H11001 Ending Retained Earnings. Therefore, changes inthe balance sheet during an accounting period arereflected in the income statement, the cash flowstatement, and the statement of owner's equity. Assets are probable current and future economic benets obtained or controlled by a particular entityas a result of past transactions or events. They area practice's economic resources. Assets can be cre-ated by operating activities (i.e., generating netincome), investing activities (i.e., purchasing equip-ment), and nancing activities (i.e., borrowing).Examples of assets include cash and cash equiva-lents, accounts receivables, inventory, prepaid ex-penses, property plant and equipment, pensionassets, and intangible assets. Furthermore, assetsare classied as current assets, xed assets, otherassets such as intangible assets, and long-term ac-counts receivables. Liabilities are probable future economic costs and creditor claims on the company's resources.They are created by nancing activities (i.e., bor-rowing) and operating activities (i.e., generatingnet income). Liabilities arise from present obli-gations of a particular entity to transfer assets orprovide services to other entities in the future as aresult of past transactions or events. Examplesof liabilities include accounts payable, short-termnote payable, unearned revenue, income taxespayable, and long-term notes payable. Further-more, liabilities are classied as current liabilitiesand long-term liabilities. Owner's equity is the residual interest in the net assets of an entity that remains after deductingliabilities. Equity is created by nancing activitiesand by operating activities. Owner's equity con-sists of capital contributed by the practice's ownersand the cumulative earnings the practice has re-tained. Examples of owner's equity includes con-tributed capital, par value of common stock,additional paid in capital, and retained earnings.5. Financial Ratio Analysis Financial ratios are based on backward-looking datato provide insights into the nancial relationshipsthat are useful in forecasting future earnings andcash flow, information about the nancial flexibilityof the practice, and a means of evaluating manage-ment performance internally and to its peers. Fi-nancial ratios are not useful when viewed inisolation, compared with other companies using dif-ferent accounting methods and there may be dif-culty in locating comparable ratios when analyzingcompanies that operate in multiple industries.Conclusions cannot be made from viewing one set ofratios. Ratios must be viewed relative to one an-other over time, between companies, or relative tobenchmark values. Judgment is required. Deter-mining the target or comparison value for a ratio isdifcult and may actually be some range of accept-able values rather than a single target value. Asset Ratios Inventory Turnover RatioThis ratio measures the number of times, on aver-age, inventory is sold during the period. Its pur-pose is to measure the liquidity of the inventory.A high number suggests a greater sales efciencyand should be compared with industry standards.Fixed-Asset Turnover RatioThe xed-asset turnover ratio measures the compa-ny's effectiveness in generating sales from its invest-ments in plant, property, and equipment. If thexed-asset turnover ratio is low compared with theindustry, it means that sales are low or the invest-ment in plant and equipment is too much.Total Assets RatioThe total asset ratio represents the amount of revenuegenerated by a company as a result of its assets onhand. It measures how efciently a company is op-erating. A low ratio suggests that the total assets ofthe business are not providing adequate revenue.Asset-to-Equity RatioThe asset-to-equity ratio is a measure of nancialleverage and long-term solvency. A high ratio sug-gests the practice may be overall leveraged. Protability Ratios Return-on-Assets RatioReturn on assets is a key ratio of protability, indi-cating how efciently a practice's assets are em-ployed. A low ratio suggests that earnings are lowfor the amount of assets.Return-on-Equity RatioReturn on equity is a protability ratio measuringhow well equity capital is used. The higher theratio, the greater the return on the capital invested. 286 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEProt Margin RatioProt margin measures how much out of every dol-lar of sales a company keeps in earnings. A higherprot margin suggests a more protable companythat has better control over its costs compared withits competitors.Basic Earnings Power RatioThe basic earnings power ratio evaluates the effec-tiveness of a practice's operation by measuring thebasic protability of assets by excluding interest andtax expense. This ratio should be examined in con-junction with turnover ratios to help pinpoint poten-tial problems regarding asset management. Debt Ratios Total Debt RatioThe total debt ratio is a measure of a company'snancial leverage. A high ratio generally meansthat a company has been aggressive in nancing itsgrowth with debt.Interest Coverage RatioThe interest coverage ratio is a measure of the num-ber of times a company could make the interestpayments on its debt with its earnings before inter-est and taxes. The lower the ratio, the higher thepractice's debt burden and the greater the possibil-ity of bankruptcy or default.Debt/Equity RatioThe debt/equity ratio suggests what proportion ofequity and debt that the company is using to nanceits assets. A ratio greater than one means assetsare mainly nanced with debt, less than 1 meansequity provides a majority of the nancing.Capitalization RatioThe capitalization ratio measures the debt compo-nent of a practice's capital structure to support acompany's operations and growth. The higher theratio, the greater amount of leverage the practice istaking on. Capitalization ratios need to be evalu-ated over time, and compared with other data andstandards. Efciency Ratios Cash TurnoverThe cash turnover ratio suggests a practice's ef-ciency in its use of cash for generation of salesrevenue. The higher the number, the greater ef-ciency a practice is deploying cash.Days Sales in Account ReceivablesThe days' sales in account receivables ratio mea-sures how many days it takes to collect accountreceivables. The lower the ratio, the more efcienta practice is at collecting account receivables.Account Receivables TurnoverAccount receivables turnover is a measure of thepractice's ability to collect account receivables.The higher the ratio, the more efciently a practiceis at collecting account receivables.Inventory Turnover in DaysThe inventory turnover ratio represents how manytimes inventory was used and then again replaced.A low ratio suggests that inventories are not beingmanaged efciently.Days Sales in InventoryThe day sales in inventory ratio measure how manydays it takes to turn inventory in sales. The lowerthe ratio, the more efciently a practice is at con-verting inventory into sales. 6. Practice Valuation Analysis The purpose of this portion of the paper is to providean analysis of the value of MVEH. This paper isdesigned to describe the approach, illustrate thecomputations, and to provide a basis of the ndingsbased upon the facts and assumptions used in mak-ing a conclusion. The facts regarding MVEH havenot been reviewed, veried, or audited in any way. This report is not intended to be an appraisal of the value of a practice. We have not appraised apractice, nor have we gathered sufcient informa-tion in order to prepare an appraisal of a practice.In fact, we are not appraisers, and do not, in thenormal course of our business prepare appraisals.Therefore, this report is designed to simply illus-trate the potential value of the cash flows generatedby a business. 7. Computation Methodology There are many ways to analyze value. One canvalue all the assets of a business and subtract theoutstanding liabilities and consider that value.With this approach one must attempt to determinethe value of the goodwill or \"blue sky\" (because thistoo is an asset of the business) of the business inorder to approximate the value of the business.Valuing goodwill is a difcult thing to do that re-quires several subjective decisions upon which rea-sonable people could disagree. Another more objective way to value a business is to simply multiply some objective number, whetherthat number is Earnings Before Interest TaxesDepreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), grossrevenue, gross prot, or net income by a rathersubjective multiplier. These multipliers vary by in-dustry and are typically derived from historical in-formation based upon historical sales prices forsimilar businesses. Although this might be a rela-tively easy calculation, this approach tends to behistorical in its perspective. It does not take intoaccount how much the business might be makingthe in future. Because of its relative ease in calcu- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 287THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICElation, this tends to be the most widely used methodof estimating a closely held business. For businesses that are widely held and have nu- merous buy/sell transactions, historical transactionscan help one determine current value. This is mosttrue in the public markets. Because publicly heldcompanies are so widely held there tend to be mul-tiple transactions every day, and even every minute.Because all of these transactions are between a will-ing buyer and a willing seller and are all at \"arm'slength,\" these transactions create the best view of acompany's worth. Unfortunately, in your businessyou do not have any public companies and thereforethis is not a viable method of valuation. The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also developed its own method of valuing a business.In IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60 the IRS states that thevalue of a business is \"the price at which the prop-erty would change hands between a willing buyerand a willing seller when the former is not under anycompulsion to buy and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell, both parties having reasonableknowledge of relevant facts.\" This denition haswithstood numerous court challenges and remainsthe IRS standard. The problem is in the calcula-tion of this value. Although you would be hardpressed to dispute the premise of this denition, thedenition provides very little specic guidance as tohow to determine value when there is a lack of a\"willing buyer and a willing seller.\" We believe thebest way to determine what a \"willing buyer and awilling seller\" would pay for a business is based onthe protability of the company and the cash flowcreated by the business. 8. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis The best way to analyze the value of any business isbased on the money that can be made by that busi-ness. There are many things that determine howmuch money a particular business can make andthereby its value. The most basic aspect of makingmoney is cash flow. This approach to valuation isknown as discounted cash flow analysis. The cash flow of a business is determined by tak- ing the net income of a business and adjusting forthe noncash items contained within that net incomenumber. Depreciation is one of the most obviousnoncash charges against income that must be addedback to determine net cash flow from a business.There are several others including adjusting the netincome, if the business reports net income on anaccrual basis, for changes in accounts receivable andaccounts payable and other deferred or accrueditems of income and expense. Another adjustmentrelates to capital expenditures. Cash flow shouldbe reduced to the extent the business takes a portionof its prots and spends that money on capital ex-penditures such as equipment, real estate, or otherassets. Future debt principal repayment will alsoreduce the amount of cash available to be distrib-uted as a return on equity.Once a business has determined its current cash flow it must consider how that cash flow is going togrow over time. Once that is determined you canproject how much cash flow a particular businesswill generate over time. Obviously one would notpay the same for cash created 10 years from nowthat they would pay for cash created today. Thesefuture cash flows must be discounted back to today'sdollars. This is done by taking each future cash flow that the business will create and determining how muchmoney that cash flow in the future is worth today.Another way to think about this is to consider howmuch money one would have to put to work today, ata given interest rate, for that money to be worth thecash flow from the business in that future year. The \"interest rate\" one would apply today to those future cash flows is also known as the discount rate.The riskier the business, the higher the discountrate. Another way to state this is, the discount rateis equal to the risk that the future cash flows of thebusiness will not be realized. There is a readily accepted formula for determin- ing the discount rate in most situations (DiscountRate /H11005Risk Free Rate /H11001Beta (Market Return - Risk Free Rate). There are three components tothe formula. First is typical market return. We have used 10% in our calculations for market return. Over anextended period of time, the stock market has re-turned an average of approximately 10%. This rateof return in the stock market has declined duringthe last few years but we feel 10% is still an accuraterepresentation of market return. From this mar-ket return of 10% you subtract the risk-free rate ofreturn. Currently, the 10-year US Treasury bondis yielding approximately 2.0%. This results in an8% risk-adjusted rate of return. You then multiplythis risk-adjusted rate of return by the Beta of theindividual company. Beta is a factor ranging from0 to 2 and is designed to measure how much morerisk a particular stock has, when compared with anindex, for instance, the S&P 500 (0 being no risk inthe market, 1 being average risk in the stock mar-ket, and 2 being the most risk possible in the stockmarket). We have assigned a Beta of 1.04, which isthe beta for VCA, Inc, a publicly traded animalhealth care company. In order to get the nal dis-count, you must multiply the risk-adjusted rate ofreturn (8%) by the Beta of 1.04 and add back therisk-free rate of 2%, resulting in a discount rate of10.32%. This seems reasonable as an overall mea-sure of risk for your business. The other way toconsider this discount rate is asking if you would bewilling to buy your business if you knew you wouldreceive a 10.32% rate or return on that investment? Finally, the IRS allows you to apply a lack of marketability discount for closely held businesses.The discount for lack of marketability is an amountor percentage deducted from the value of an owner-ship interest to reflect absence of marketability. 288 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEA primary concern for driving this price reduction isthat, over the uncertain timeframe required to com-plete a sale, the nal sale price becomes less certainand with it a decline in value is quite possible.Accordingly, a prudent buyer would want a discountfor acquiring such an interest to protect againstvalue loss in a future sale scenario. For your price,we used a 40% lack of marketability and illiquiditydiscount. 9. Risk Factors to This Valuation The risk factors that could affect the value of yourpractice include, but are not limited to, the possibleloss and replacement of a top-producing veterinar-ian, the cost to maintaining efciencies in practiceoperations from a change in ownership and leader-ship of the practice, and maintaining cost efcien-cies in practice operations as your practice expandsor contracts. 10. Limitations on This Valuation Like any valuation analysis, the discounted cashflow analysis has its limitations. It is rather sensi-tive to variations in the data inputs. If any of theinputs are materially misstated, the resulting valu-ation will also be misstated. Due to the limitedinformation received from the various practices,very limited information on capital expenditures isreflected, so the valuation may be overstated due tothe capital expenditures within the business. Typ-ically, cash flow would be reduced for money spenton new equipment.

Colo \u00b4n, DVM, MBA To succeed as business owners, veterinarians must change their mental approach to dailywork. Veterinarians must not only see themselves as veterinarians, but as being in the businessof providing veterinary medical care; even when they sell medications to patients, they are doingso as an extension of the service provision. Author's AAEP. 1. Introduction The concept of service marketing proposes that thesuccess of any service provision should only be mea-sured by the degree of customer satisfaction created.It also suggests that a market for veterinary servicesis made up by the people who are willing, able, andcapable of purchasing the services; in other words,the people who want to buy veterinary services,have the nancial means to buy the veterinary ser-vices, and have physical access to the veterinary services. Because different horse owners havedifferent needs and wants, to develop a proper mar-keting strategy (Fig. 1) for the services that a veter-inarian would like to offer, the veterinarian shoulddivide this market or group of potential veterinarycustomers into different sets or segments of consum-ers; a process referred to as market segmentation.For example, while any horse owner willing to re-quest veterinary care for their horses is part of themarket for veterinary services, those looking for re-productive or lameness or race-track veterinary caremake up different segments within the market. After identifying the different segments of the market, the veterinarian can create a specic targetgroup or target market for a particular veterinaryservice that the veterinarian would like to provideby selecting the market segment in which to concen-trate that particular veterinary activity. For exam-ple, if the veterinarian would like to offer soft-tissuetendon and ligament ultrasonography, the practitio-ner could create a target market based on the spe-cic needs and wants of the owners of show horseswithin the practice area. Once the target market iscreated for a specic veterinary service, the veteri-narian should develop a specic positioning strategytoward that target market. Your positioning strat-egy is what allows the consumer to perceive you asdifferent relative to every other veterinarian that isattempting to provide the same veterinary service tothat specic target market. For example, client ed-ucation that goes beyond the education providedduring clinical diagnosis is a key element of thepositioning strategy of my own practice. Creating a target market and a positioning strat- egy should be the rst two steps of the practice'smarketing strategy, the nal one should be the cre-ation of a market mix which is the creation of theservice to be provided, the price for the service, thepromotion of the service and the place of distributionfor the service. aThis market mix should be specif- ically tailored to the selected target market (basedon their known needs and wants) to reinforce the 296 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE NOTESpractice's positioning strategy that will make you beperceived by the consumer as different from every-one else for that specic veterinary service. When a practice adds the tactical details regard- ing the when, who, and how of the marketing strat-egy implementation, the practice will have createdits marketing plan for that specic veterinary ser-vice. Each veterinary service to be offered requiresits own marketing plan (marketing strategy plustactical details) to maximize the success of eachparticular veterinary service provision. Understandthat the needs and wants of the show-horse ownerwanting to breed their one mare with frozen semenare not the same needs and wants of the owner of a20-Thoroughbred broodmare band. Although eachof these reproductive scenarios presents a similartype of reproductive veterinary service, the differ-ence in the target market requires different market-ing strategies and marketing plans to maximize thedegree of customer satisfaction created during theservice provision. The combination of all market-ing plans developed by the practice will make up thepractice's marketing program. Most service providers do not realize that there is a difference between nding clients that will utilizethe services they provide, and identifying a targetmarket for which the services to be provided will betailored to meet the consumer's needs. The idea ofservice marketing not only requires the strategy tobe designed based on the satisfaction of consumerwants, but should also adapt to changes in uncon-trollable factors (i.e., political, legal, economic, anddemographic changes) that ultimately change thosespecic consumer needs. 2. Service Experience Truth is, there is really not that much differencein the skill level of good veterinarians. So where'sthe difference? Differentiation can be achievedthrough the consumer's perceived quality of theservice experience; the service experience is the in-tangible process that can serve as the source ofdifferentiation. When purchasing goods, the bene-t perceived by the consumer is bundled and encap-sulated within the good itself; when buying a pack ofAAA batteries, a satisfactory experience might justbe dependent on getting a trusted brand for a rea- sonable price. Services, in contrast, deliver thebundle of benets through the experience that iscreated for the consumer; getting a good-tastingmeal at a reasonable price in a restaurant might notbe a satisfactory dining experience if it was marredby bad service, obnoxious patrons, and lthy rest-room facilities. So while the marketing strategydiscussed is essential in developing the service,there are manageable factors that can impact andinfluence the experience. 3. Servuction Model The Servuction Model (Fig. 2) provides a frameworkfor understanding the consumer experience and ba-sically relies on the fact that the quality of the ser-vice will depend on the perceived experience, notjust on the result of the service. Under this modelthere are four factors that influence the experience: 1. Servicescape: the servicescape are the non- living aspects that provide tangible cluesabout the service to be received. Is theclinic neat and tidy? Are the decorations inviting? Was the entranceway clean ofsnow in the winter? All these things givethe client a clue about the service to be re-ceived and make a difference in the percep-tion of quality by the consumer. 2. Contact personnel: what are the interper- sonal skills presented by the service providerand assistants? Their appearance? Thecontact personnel are the public face of thepractice; they are the practice's representa-tion in the implementation of the marketingstrategy. 3. Other customers: other customers can im- pact the service experience through theirability to disrupt the experience or throughtheir positive or negative comments abouttheir own experience. You will have a 100%chance of someone chiming in with theiropinion if you discuss a case with a horseowner in the middle of the riding barn on abusy Saturday afternoon. Although a veter-inarian can control the message provided bythe servicescape and the contact personnel, Fig. 1. Steps for creating a marketing strategy. Fig. 2. Servuction Model framework. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 297THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEthe potentially unwanted influence comingfrom other customers will not be controllableunless you take preemptive action. If possi-ble, the veterinarian should make an effort toisolate the service experience from this out-side influence to better control the delivery. 4. Invisible organization and systems: there are behind-the-scenes things that the cus-tomer never sees that impact the customerexperience. Was your appointment bookkept updated or did you just forget that thefarm call was scheduled for noon and not2:00 pm? Was a payment not properly re-corded and the client got a past-due bill for aservice already paid? Systems that are in-visible to the customer can easily and rapidlyalter the perceived experience. The reasons why controlling the service experienceis so essential are directly interrelated to the char-acteristics of service that differentiate it from thetransfer of a good: 1. Intangible: unlike a good, a service is an intangible that cannot be stored; the cus-tomer cannot touch it or inspect it beforeconsumption. For this reason, the customerdoes not own the service after provision, theyjust experience it. The veterinarian willnot necessarily have a happy horse owner after saving the animal's life if the veterinar-ian was rude and disrespectful during theemergency. 2. Inseparability: the service provider and the customer are both directly involved in theservice production process. The customer'spresence is a factor that somewhat inhibitsmass production of the service as both par-ties must be present simultaneously. Inaddition, the length of service delivery is dic-tated by the customer's presence and needs;explaining and communicating are as impor-tant to the experience as the veterinary ser-vice itself. 3. Heterogeneity: standardization of the ser- vice provision is difcult to achieve and con-trol because there is an inherent variabilityin the people factor related to the productionof the service. A customer will have a zoneof tolerance based on a range between ex-pected and adequate service. As long as thedelivered service falls within this range, avariation in quality will still be acceptable. 4. Perishability: a service is consumed at the time of production and therefore productionand consumption cannot be separated bytime and space. This creates a problem re-lated to supply and demand as the serviceprovider will nd a time-related ceiling inthe physical ability to fulll rising de-mand. The inability to inventory the ser-vice means that its quality cannot bemeasured prior to consumption, the mea-suring occurs during and after the serviceexperience. Overall, there are strategies that can be imple-mented to address these service characteristics liketactics to smooth out demand (i.e., pricing strategieson dental services during the slow season) or tomanage the supply (i.e., practice expansion or part-time employees). As previously mentioned, when itcomes to service provision, the satisfaction is notjust with the outcome, but also with the process. 4. Customer Satisfaction The customer's satisfaction is based on the experi-ence with the outcome and the process. Attentionto the process is the way to achieve that desireddifferentiation; therefore the veterinarian has to de-velop behaviors that will improve the customer'ssatisfaction with the process. Among the many dif-ferent theories of how to explain customer satisfac-tion, the expectancy disconrmation perspectivepresents a simple way for a veterinarian to visualizehow to positively affect the experience. Althoughexpectations are dened by what the customerthinks he is going to get from the service experience,perceptions are what the customer believes he gotfrom the service experience. For the customer,perceptions dene reality. The expectancy discon-rmation perspective suggests that customer satis-faction is the result of perceptions meeting orexceeding expectations. The practitioner needs tounderstand what the client's expectations are, thengure out ways to deliver a service experience thatwill equal or exceed those expectations. So where do the customer's expectations come from? There are explicit service promises based onadvertising, communications, and contracts. Thereare also implicit service promises based on thingssuch as price and servicescape. Expectations arealso affected by promises created by word of mouthand by past experiences. Put together, these prom-ises impact the predicted level of service expected bythe customer. If this expectation fullls the needsof the customer's desired service, then the veterinar-ian will have the opportunity to provide the serviceand hopefully do his part to meet or exceed thoseexpectations. The reasons to achieve customer satisfaction should be obvious: unhappy customers do not re-turn and spread negative word of mouth; satisedcustomers bring repeated and more frequent busi-ness together with positive word of mouth. In ad-dition, satised customers are not only less likely tobe lost to competition, but they will also be moreinsulated from price competition; meaning that notonly will they not want to leave you, but they areless likely to be tempted to leave because of lowerprices. 298 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE5. Dissatised Customer It would be impossible to meet or exceed every cli-ent's expectations. Although counterintuitive, theveterinarian should encourage all clients to com-plain about any unsatisfactory perception of experi-ence. A complaint is an opportunity for recovery.Although dissatised noncomplainers just walkaway, marketing studies have shown that custom- ers who have had their complaints heard and re-solved are more likely to provide repeat business,together with positive word of mouth about the pos-itive resolution of a dissatisfaction. In fact, a com-plainer who has had his issue resolved mightbecome a better client and practice promoter thanthe client who never had an issue with the service inthe rst place. The complaint also provides cluesas to what part of the expectation creating promisesneeds to be addressed. You cannot control someonecreating a superhero image of you to a horse-owningfriend that leads to unrealistic expectations of theservice they, in turn, may receive; but you cancontrol making an explicit service promise if, forexample, a previous experience has brought aboutthe realization that the specic promise cannot befullled. Key to the ability to resolve a customer's com- plaint is the development of a service recovery pro-gram that will actually allow for differentiation inthe face of a dissatised customer. The service re-covery program should create an opportunity to sat-isfy the customer's needs and wants within theperiod of dissatisfaction. The goal is to avoid clientdefection and the loss of the customer's lifetimevalue to the practice. The program should encour-age complaint feedback and provide a framework forthe process of response and resolution. Though notall negative disconrmation scenarios will be re-solved effectively, positive resolution of some of them will lead to positive differentiation because theservice process during recovery from a dissatisfac-tion will always be part of the customer satisfactionequation. 6. Conclusion Veterinarians have not been trained to be businesspeople. In order for veterinary businesses tothrive, veterinarians must change their mindset andrealize that veterinary medicine is not just about theoutcome of a procedure, but also about the experi-ence perceived by the client during the process.If you become an astute clinician through trainingand experience, you will satisfactorily compete withother equally good veterinarians. But if you de-velop service delivery skills that will enhance theclient's perceived experience during the service pro-vision, you will differentiate yourself from the crowdand create satised clients that will never want toleave you.

Ramey, Ordal, MSc; and Martin Lee, PhD, CStat, CSci Online survey tools can provide equine practitioners valuable information about horse owners that can beused to improve the quality of veterinary care provided.

Introduction Anonymous feedback surveys provide valuableinformation for businesses. They can assist in as-sessing employee satisfaction, helping to understandthe dynamics of the workplace, and in assessing theperformance and productivity of the company. In human medicine, patient satisfaction surveys are commonly performed to improve the care andexperience of patients. Although disconnect be-tween patient satisfaction and health outcomes hasbeen reported, 1medical patient satisfaction surveys can nevertheless provide useful insights into differ-ent aspects of a health care business, including per-sonnel, facilities, and procedures, and can thusidentify areas that need improvement. Even theact of soliciting feedback can help create an image oftrustworthiness. Although individual veterinary practices may col- lect satisfaction surveys, the extent and manner inwhich such surveys are conducted is largely un-known. Online survey tools are widely availableand easy to use and they may offer a potentialmethod to help veterinarians gain a better under-standing of their clients. This survey of 8069 horseowners was conducted using one such online surveysoftware and questionnaire tool. The objective ofthis survey was to obtain information about veteri-nary clients and certain preferences relevant to clin-ical equine veterinary practice. 2. Materials and Methods A survey with 23 questions about veterinary careprovided to horse owners was developed and postedto SurveyMonkey, an online survey site. aTwo questions, pertaining to equestrian activities, andreasons that horses were examined (Questions 1 and5) allowed more than one answer. Prior to the sur-vey the questions were reviewed by a biostatisticianand two experienced equine practitioners, all atarm's length, to assess wording, relevance, and in-terest to horse owners. The survey was posted on December 19, 2016, and closed on March 6, 2017, having been promoted onthe lead author's Facebook blog page and shared ina snowball sampling fashion. Results from the -nal tally of 8069 respondents were analyzed withsimple descriptive statistics. Some questions wereskipped by respondents; the number of responses isindicated with each 300 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE NOTES3. Results (Ordered by Survey Question) Those identifying as \"Other\" were 22.43% of re-spondents and included the use of horses as com-panions, and for polo, clicker training, saddle seat,fox hunting, pleasure driving, equine-assistedtherapy, and reining. \"Other\" had considerableoverlap with other disciplines; for example, peoplemay have identied themselves as barrel ridersrather than participants in Western PerformanceHorse events. Acute illness included colic, respiratory disease, and skin problems. \"Other\" reasons to see veter-inarians came in at 23.01% of respondents, andincluded examinations fullling requirements forinterstate transport, choke, wound management,application of various \"alternative\" therapies, andbreeding. \"Other\" reasons for satisfaction were selected as 7.17% of responses, and included peace of mindand reassurance. A small number of individualrespondents expressed dissatisfaction with their AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 301THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICEveterinarian(s); this was not tabulated as apercentage. Various reasons were given for not using the same veterinarian again, including an inabilityto have service from the same veterinarian (inmulti-veterinarian practices), poor communica-tion skills, failure to come up with a diagnosis,failure to attend to emergencies, cost, and billingproblems.\"Other\" ways respondents found their veterinar- ian (16.85%) included limited choices, and referralby barn owners or trainers. Questions 12 to 18 were posed on a star scale format, with 1 star being the lowest level of agree-ment and 5 stars being the highest. These werestatements meant to assess what was important tothe respondents, as opposed to an evaluation of theservice they received. 302 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE4. Discussion During the past 10 to 15 years, the use of online andmobile methods for survey research has allowed do-it-yourself researchers to design, conduct, and ana-lyze surveys for a relatively small cost. Surveys area powerful research tool, as long as their limitationsare understood. Online surveys in particularly canreach very wide audiences, exploiting the \"viral\"phenomenon as posts are shared via social media.Respondents input their own data, and it is auto-matically stored electronically. Analysis thus be-comes easier and is available immediately. Suchsurveys are convenient for respondents, who cananswer questions on their own schedule, and attheir own pace. Surveys can be designed with vary-ing degrees of complexity. In an online format, re-spondents may be more willing to share informationsince that information is not being disclosed directlyto another person. The anonymity provided by theonline platform also restricts the influence of inter-viewers on responses. Online surveying has some disadvantages. For example, certain populations may be less likely tohave Internet access and may not be able respond toonline questionnaires. It is also harder to drawprobability samples based on email addresses orWeb site visitations. Although interviewers can in-fluence responses, the lack of a trained interviewerto clarify and probe can possibly lead to less reliabledata. It is not possible to verify identity in anyway, and there is no guarantee that the responseswill be equivalent to those that would have resultedfrom a paper-based survey. The resulting sample,as noted in the responses, was overwhelmingly fe-male adults (over 21 years of age), who owned horsesfor more than 5 years. The majority were pleasure/trail riders and owned at least 2 horses. As a re-sult, the ndings from this survey would reflect thatpopulation. Online surveys are highly prone to sample bias, given that they are often shared among people withsimilar interests and attitudes; this, however, mayalso work in the researchers' favor if they are inter-ested in the opinions of a certain homogenous group. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 303THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: FINANCIAL BASICS FOR A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICESurveys that are particularly long or require a greatdeal of free text answers are especially vulnerable tosample bias, given that they naturally select forrespondents with strong opinions on the survey sub-ject. For these reasons, this survey was designedto be fairly short, with relatively simple answerchoices. Recall bias, that is, systematic error due to differences in accuracy or completeness of recall tomemory of past events or experiences is another po-tential bias, 2as is the \"halo effect,\" where the overall impression of a person, company, brand, or productcan influence the observer's feelings and thoughtsabout that entity. 3 Ethically, one of the key advantages to using on- line methodology is that given that IP numbers aretypically not collected, there is no way of tracingrespondents. There is no need to use email ad-dresses unless follow-up questions are part of thesurvey design, and there is less likelihood of invad-ing privacy. 4Respondents can be advised of the uses that will be made of the data (including publi-cation and other forms of dissemination), which iscentral to informed consent. This can be presentedand explained on the rst page of the survey prior toanswering questions, making use of the \"impliedconsent\" model wherein completion and submissionof the survey implies consent to use the data forresearch purposes. Relatively few marketing/satisfaction surveys of horse owners seem to have been published. In2012, the American Association of Equine Practitio-ners conducted a survey of 6148 horse owners andtrainers, in response to concerns about decreasingfrequency of use of equine veterinarians. 5Ameri - can Horse Publications has conducted 3 such sur-veys, with the most recent survey of 10,662 horseowners being completed in 2015. 6 This survey identies some interesting areas of consideration for equine veterinarians, especiallyfor those with practices covering the main demo-graphic groups identied in this survey (primarilyfemale, employed, 40 to 60 years of age, with one ormore pleasure or performance horse competing invarious disciplines). Many of these areas havebeen highlighted in other surveys. For example: Equine veterinarians who do not practice equine dental care might consider adding thisexpertise to their practice, given that 77.19%of respondents saw their veterinarians forequine dental work. Clients seem to be more interested that their horse be treated with kindness, as opposed tokindness shown by the veterinarian tothemselves. Clients value discussing the cost of treatment, as well as treatment options, prior to treat-ment being performed on their horses. Most veterinarians seem to communicatefairly well, but communication is important tomost horse owners. 5-7 Clients appreciate being educated about their horses by their veterinarians. A majority of clients want the veterinarian to do what they think is best, even if they thinkthey know what is best for their horses. A signicant number of clients (43.6%) feel that they know what is best for their horse,and want their veterinarian to act accordingly. The treatment received by the horse seems to be far more important than the value for treat-ment received. Recommendations from friends, family, barn owners, and trainers are a far more importantsource of business than is advertising or Inter-net presence. The potential exists for online surveying to be apowerful tool in assessment of a variety of areas ofequine veterinary medicine, including after-marketproduct assessment, customer satisfaction, andidentifying sources of information from which horseowners are educated about their horses (to name afew). Equine veterinarians may want to make useof such surveys to improve their practice and clientsatisfaction.

However, due to anatomic complexity,superimposition of osseous, soft tissue, and dentalstructures, accurate diagnosis and thus effectivetreatment can be challenging. 6This in part might be responsible for the relatively high percentage ofcases, as high as 47%, that historically have beenreported to develop complications following surgicaltreatment. 2 2. Imaging of the Paranasal Sinuses Although an accurate diagnosis can be made usingconventional imaging modalities such as radiogra-phy and nasal endoscopy, in certain cases these failto give the clinician an accurate idea regarding theextent of the lesion and the structures affected.Other imaging modalities, such as sinoscopy andnuclear scintigraphy can provide useful informationalthough not without limitations. Perkins and col-leagues reported on their experience visualizing theventral conchal report they to be particularly useful in cases ofprimary sinusitis from both a diagnostic (82%) andtherapeutic (77%) standpoint; however, this tech-nique did not demonstrate of secondary sinusitis such as tooth-root infec-tions. 9Nuclear scintigraphy has been shown to be an extremely sensitive diagnostic imaging techniquefor identifying areas of bony inflammation and remod-eling. 10In the equine head it can be used to identify and distinguish primary sinusitis from secondarysinusitis due to dental disease or neoplasia. Al- 99Tc-methyl disphosphonate (MDP) is typically used, 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO)-labelled be used success-fully to identify tooth-root abscess. Scintigraphy has the disadvantages of lacking a good three-dimensional representation of the sinuses and thepotential for both false negatives and positives dueto artifacts. In particular, when dealing with cases AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 305IN-DEPTH: INTERACTIVE CASE DISCUSSIONS - UPPER RESPIRATORY NOTESof dental disease scintigraphy can fail to discern withcertainty the specic tooth root affected. However,when combined with radiography and in some in-stances sensi-tivity and specicity. Computed tomography (CT; and to a lesser ex- tent magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is consid-ered by many to be the current gold standard for a complete evaluation of the sinus cavities in equinepatients. 6,7,11-14Major advantages include the lack of superimposition of structures or summation of bonydensities seen with radiographs. In addition, there ispotential for the characterization of fluid densities,good visualization of the individual tooth roots, andthe condition of the various communications betweenthe different sinus cavities. 11There are a number of recent publications in the past 2-3 years that describethe CT (and MRI) characteristics of conditions com-monly affecting the paranasal sinus region that will bediscussed in this presentation. 6,11-13In addition, with the increased prevalence of multi-slice helical CTscanners and sophisticated processing software, im- age reconstruction, and manipulation offers the sur-geon a unique perspective of the affected area priorto surgery. 3. Anatomy of the Paranasal Sinuses Six paired sinuses make extends from the rostral aspect of the calvarium up to half the distance between theinfraorbital foramen and the orbit, and is contiguousrostrally with the dorsal conchal sinus (thus formingthe conchofrontal sinus as it is also known). Theventral conchal sinus lies axially, slightly dorsalto the rostral maxillary sinus with whom it commu-nicates. The boundaries of the maxillary sinusesare the following: the dorsal limit is represented bya line drawn from the infraorbital foramen caudallyparallel to the facial crest in line with the medialcanthus of the eye; the rostral limit is representedby a vertical line from the facial crest to the infraor-bital foramen; the caudal limit is slightly rostral to the root of the orbital process of the zygomaticbone; the ventral limit is at the level of the teethroots. The maxillary sinuses are divided into ros-tral and caudal compartments by a complete obliquebony septum that begins approximately 5 cm caudalto the rostral extent of the facial crest. The rostral maxillary sinus communicates with the ventral conchal sinus and the caudal maxillarysinus communicates with the frontal sinus via thefrontomaxillary aperture. Drainage into the nasalcavity occurs via a common nasomaxillary aperturethat enters the middle nasal meatus at the canthus of inflammationmay occlude either duct or common aperture, thusperpetuating the disease or making lavageor drainage difcult.4. Bacterial Sinusitis Bacterial sinusitis can be primary or secondary innature; secondary include dental disease,trauma, paranasal sinus carci-noma. 3-5,9,15Clinical signs include unilateral nasal discharge, dullness of the sinus on percussion, andrarely, facial deformity. The most common sinusesaffected in cases of primary sinusitis are the rostraland caudal maxillary sinuses as well as the ventralconchal sinus. This is a consequence of all sinusesdraining through the two maxillary sinuses, and thesusceptibility of the nasomaxillary opening to muco-sal inflammation and obstruction. Upper respira-tory tract infections such as influenza and equineherpes virus-4 can also create enough mucosal in-flammation to obstruct drainage from the sinuseswhile concurrently increasing mucous production bythe sinus mucosa. Once that happens, a secondarybacterial infection can ensue resulting in sinus em-pyema. These infections can be self limiting; how-ever, if inspissated pus accumulates and drainage isnot efcient a chronic primary sinusitis willdevelop. In chronic sinusitis, purulent material commonly collects in the ventral conchal and rostral maxillarysinuses due to their poor drainage. Once this pusbecomes inspissated, removal by normal physiologicmechanisms is practically impossible. In addition,due to the axial location of the ventral conchal sinus,inspissated pus becomes trapped on the floor of thissinus and even regular lavage has been proven to bean ineffective method to clear it. If CT is not avail-able, the use of combined imaging modalities such asradiography and in particular sinoscopy through afenestration of the ventral conchal bulla as de-scribed by Perkins and colleagues cannot only bediagnostic but potentially therapeutic to remove in-spissated material. 9 Treatment of bacterial sinusitis will depend on the underlying etiology. Although cases of acute primarysinusitis will usually resolve spontaneously, the use ofantibiotics and sinus lavage can help resolve somecases faster. Lavage of the sinus is also a criticalaspect of effective management of sinusitis. How-ever, in order for lavage to be effective, a patent naso-maxillary opening is needed to ensure drainage intothe nasal passage; if the nasomaxillary opening isnot patent, it can be potentially dilated 16or an open - ing in the rostral aspect of the conchal sinus can becreated. Lavage should be performed once or twicea day with 1-3 L sterile saline with or without of dilute cases an abscess, inspissatedexudates, or infected tooth root is the primary cause ofthe condition, debridement of the affected area via afrontal or maxillary sinusotomy (either standing or under general anesthesia) will be necessary as theuse of antibiotics alone will be ineffective. 1,2,5,15,17 Prognosis for cases of primary sinusitis is typically 306 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INTERACTIVE CASE DISCUSSIONS - UPPER RESPIRATORYexcellent; cases of secondary sinusitis will have avariable prognosis based on the underlying cause. 5. Sinusitis Secondary to Dental Pathology The most common of dental pathology affecting theparanasal sinus region is tooth root abscessationinvolving the third through sixth maxillary cheekteeth, which reside the rostral and caudalmaxillary sinuses. 1,2In these cases, nasal dis - charge is typically copious and malodorous due tothe anaerobic bacterial component that these ab-scesses regularly will have. In these cases radio-graphic identication of the precise affected toothroot can be challenging and other imaging modali-ties such as nuclear scintigraphy, but in particularCT can be critical in coming up with an accuratediagnosis and location of the affected tooth, includ-ing the presence of small stulas that communicatewith the oral cavity. These cases will only tran-siently benet from antibiotic administration andsinus lavage; removal of the affected tooth root anddebridement/removal of the abscess is necessary forcomplete resolution. It is this author's opinion aswell as others that these cases benet greatly fromperforming a CT study preoperatively to accuratelyidentify and develop an effective surgical plan.Subjectively this has resulted in a reduction in post-operative complications and recurrence, which inthe long run is more cost effective. 6. Paranasal Sinus Cyst Cysts within the paranasal sinuses are not and unknown etiology. As they en-large they can cause occlusion of the nasomaxillaryopening precluding drainage and resulting in fluidaccumulation within the sinus that may obscure theradiographic appearance of any cystic structures.Cysts can also create variable amounts of mucosalinflammation and can create signicant facial swell-ing. Because of the aforementioned occlusion of thenasomaxillary opening, these cases will typicallyshow little to no nasal discharge. When present,this discharge is not quite as purulent as with otherconditions affecting the sinus and will not be mal-odorous. In some cases, completing nasal endos-copy is not possible due to obstruction of the affectednasal passage from mucosal swelling and turbinatedistortion. In cases with facial swelling, aspirationof the cyst can be performed with a 14-gauge needleas the deformed bone is typically thin; aspirationwill usually reveal a white or clear yellow fluid.A full radiographic series including lateral, obliqueand dorso ventral projections show a homogenous,rounded, soft-tissue-density mass with occasionally apartially mineralized capsule. In addition, fluid lines are commonly seen due to the secondary empyemathat these cysts create. On occasion it can be dif-cult to identify or differentiate a paranasal sinuscyst from other pathologic conditions due to similarsoft-tissue-density characteristics or because ofthe presence of abundant empyema. In these in-stances, the use of CT can be tremendously bene-cial to characterize the lesion type as well as deneits exact location, which will dictate treatment andsurgical approach. The ideal course of treatment for paranasal sinus cysts is surgical removal via the appropriate sinusflap. To reduce the chance of recurrence, as muchof the capsule and lining of the cyst should be re-moved. Prognosis in these cases is typically excel-lent with adequate management. 7. Progressive Ethmoid Hematomas Progressive ethmoid hematomas (PEHs) are de-ned as expansive hematoma that devel-ops under the respiratory mucosa in the area of theethmoid labyrinth. 1In these cases the mucosa stretches to accommodate the expanding hematoma.Although most PEHs occur in the caudal nasal pas-sage, they can also occur within the paranasal si-nuses. Clinical signs include serosanguineous tosanguineous discharge, respiratory stridor, or exer-cise intolerance for those that expand sufcientlywithin the nasal passage and rarely facial distortion(when present within the maxillary sinuses). Na-sal endoscopy will the ethmoidal conchae. Whenperforming endoscopy in these cases, it is importantto examine both nasal passages given that bilateraldisease can exist without bilateral clinical signs andthis can have a signicant effect on prognosis andrecurrence. Radiographs can also be effective withdorsoventral and oblique projections typically yield-ing the best results. However, small PEHs can bemissed based on their location within the sinuses.A CT scan of these cases when a PEH within thesinuses is suspected can be invaluable in ruling in orout this condition. Treatment of PEH within thenasal passage can performed with sequential buffered formalin injection treat-ments spaced once every 2-3 weeks for an average ofthree to seven treatments. Alternatively, PEHswithin the nasal passages can be ablated with theuse of sequential Nd:YAG laser treatments in non-contact mode. In cases of PEHs within the parana-sal sinuses, removal via sinusotomy with or withoutthe use of a laser is recommended. Prognosis istypically guarded as recurrence can be high, espe-cially in bilateral cases.

Standing equine sinus 2017 the nasophar-ynx and larynx in horses presented for investigationof abnormal respiratory noise and/or poor perfor-mance during exercise are performed for two prin- cipal reasons: rst to identify gross structuralabnormalities that are apparent at rest, and secondto use the appearance and function of the larynx ornasopharynx at rest as predictors for their functionduring exercise. Endoscopic examination of horses running on the treadmill was the sole method for evaluating theupper respiratory tract (URT) at exercise untilthe late 2000s when mobile over-ground endos-copy units began to be developed. During the last7-8 years there has been a considerable increasein the availability of these remote over-groundendoscopic systems. This has made exercisingendoscopy accessible to a wider variety of opera-tors and clients than previously, because tread-mill examination is restricted to a handful ofveterinary schools and larger private practices. 2. Resting Endoscopic ExaminationLaryngeal Function at Rest Resting laryngeal function grading systems are usedto make an informed prediction of the likelihood ofdynamic laryngeal collapse occurring during exer-cise. Several grading systems for laryngeal func-tion at rest have previously been described in theliterature. In 2003 a consensus system of endo-scopic laryngeal grading (the Havemeyer system)was special-ists. 1The Havemeyer laryngeal grading system (Table 1) is loosely based upon the 4-grade systemoriginally described by Hackett et al 2but has addi- tional sub-grades in grades 2 and 3. The Have-meyer system has become widely utilized, withseveral large clinics in the United States, UnitedKingdom, Australia, and other countries now usingit routinely. This grading system has been corre-lated with severity of pathological chances laryn-geal muscles interobserver, intra-observer, and intrahorse repeatability has been investigatedin horses at rest and at exercise. 4,5In addition, the Havemeyer resting subgrades have been correlatedwith exercising endoscopic ndings. 6,7 Generally speaking, horses with grade 1, 2.1, and 2.2 laryngeal function are deemed to be within nor-mal limits and have a fairly low prevalence (3-7% 6,8,9) of dynamic laryngeal collapse (vocal fold or arytenoid cartilage collapse). At the other end ofthe scale, horses with grade 4 laryngeal function atrest ubiquitously experience complete collapse(grade C) of the left arytenoid and often bilateralvocal fold collapse. Horses with Havemeyer grade3 laryngeal function, often referred to as the \"equiv-ocal\" grade, present the most challenges to clini- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 309IN-DEPTH: INTERACTIVE CASE DISCUSSIONS - UPPER RESPIRATORY NOTEScians, given that they can exhibit a wide range oflaryngeal appearances during exercise. Choosingan appropriate surgery for these horses shouldbe reliant on the results of exercising endoscopy.Hackett et al 2and Hammer et al10found, respec - tively, that 1/6 (16%) and 25 of 26 horses (96%) withresting grade 3 laryngeal function experienced dy-namic laryngeal collapse during treadmill endos-copy. A larger study by Martin et al 8reported that 29 of 36 horses (80%) with resting grade 3 laryngealfunction developed arytenoid collapse during exer-cise. The largest published study to date 9used a different endoscopic grading system at rest, butfound that 57 of 141 horses (40%) with resting la-ryngeal function grades approximately equivalent toHavemeyer grade 3 function experienced dynamiclaryngeal collapse during high speed treadmill exam- ination (HSTE). In the study by Barakzai andDixon, 666% of the 51 horses with resting grade 3 laryngeal function exhibited either partial or completearytenoid collapse during exercise. These authorsalso reported that the resting subgrades of grade 3were signicantly correlated with an increasing likeli-hood of arytenoid collapse occurring during exerciseand with the severity of the collapse that occurred.Vocal fold collapse is reported to occur with increasingfrequency as the resting laryngeal function grade in-creased from 1 to 4, and with increasing subgrades ofgrade 3. 6 Palatal Function at Rest Exercising endoscopy is required to make a deni-tive diagnosis of palatal dysfunction; however, inthe clinical situation, access to such facilities andequipment may be limited, and it can be challengingto persuade some owners and trainers of the valueof such examinations. There is contradictory evi-dence regarding the usefulness of resting endoscopicndings in predicting the development of dorsal dis-placement of the soft palate (DDSP) at exer-cise. 9,11,12The two largest studies to date have reported marked differences in the percentage ofhorses denitively diagnosed with DDSP that exhib-ited either persistent duringtheir resting examination: 51 and 11%,respectively, by et al.9 Lane et al9and Barakzai and Dixon6both found that the presence of spontaneous DDSP during restingendoscopy was a highly specic (95%) but extremelyinsensitive (15-26%) test for the gold standard ofDDSP occurring during HSTE. Therefore, use ofresting endoscopy alone as a diagnostic test for ex-Table 1.

When consideringthe implications of using this test in an individualhorse, the positive and negative predictive value(PPV and NPV) of the test should be examined,rather than sensitivity and specicity. If an indi-vidual horse making abnormal respiratory noise atexercise exhibits DDSP on a resting endoscopic ex-amination, this test would be correct in predictingDDSP at exercise in approximately half of cases(PPV /H110050.57). 6Conversely, the absence of DDSP at rest is a slightly more accurate predictor that anindividual horse will not experience DDSP duringexercise (NPV /H110050.83). 6 Persistent DDSP is a different syndrome to inter- mittent idiopathic DDSP at exercise, and is obviousin horses at rest, given that the palate remainsdisplaced almost all the time, including after swal-lowing. 13When persistent DDSP is seen on a resting scope, further manipulations should beperformed to examine the epiglottic cartilage andsub-epiglottic area, usually possible by topicallyanesthetizing the area and using broncho-oesopha-geal forceps to manipulate the palate and epiglottis,or by passing the scope per os. Other Resting Abnormalities Some abnormalities of the URT are evident imme-diately using resting endoscopy and in most ofthese cases, exercising endoscopy is not requiredto make a Over-ground exercising endoscopy is now availableto a wide variety of veterinarians, and this has im-proved our ability to denitively diagnose a greaterproportion of horses with upper respiratory tractdisorders prior to surgery. In the past, it would befair to say that the majority of horses undergoingrespiratory surgery had a diagnosis made using aneducated guess of the most likely pathology present,based upon their history and results of resting en-doscopy. In some cases, the driver's influence,changes in head and neck position, the track sur-face, or running in company are key to reproducingthe respiratory obstruction, and over-ground endo-scopic examination is the only way to make a diag-nosis. Similarly, over-ground endoscopy has lentitself to use in situations that were hitherto unheardof\u2014such as when horses are show jumping or duringStandardbred racing. 14Theoretically, more tar - geted treatment should improve our surgical successrates, although this remains to be seen. There are many variables that can affect the examination protocol for over-ground endoscopy,which subsequently affect the diagnoses and man- agement of individual cases. Problems includetrainers who are unwilling to work their horses fastto simulate race conditions because of the perceivedrisk of injury, doing multiple runs up short trainingtracks rather than exercising continuously over alonger distance (equivalent to race distance), andlack of an incline at some training gallops. If theexercise test is not a true replication of conditionsexperienced during competition, false-negative nd-ings can occur. For clinical researchers, using postoperative exer- cising endoscopy to evaluate a response to treatmentis far preferable to using a proxy measure of thepostoperative absence of disease, such as racing per-formance, or subjective assessment of success usingclinical parameters such as reduction in respiratorynoise, both of which may be influenced by numerousother factors. Cross-sectional studies investigatingthe appearance of the pharynx and larynx duringexercise in horses that have previously undergonelaryngoplasty have revealed important new infor-mation. 15-19Other such studies following up dif - ferent upper respiratory tract surgeries are inprogress 20,21and will be imperative for assessing these procedures in an objective way. Dynamic Laryngeal Collapse Dynamic laryngeal collapse is most commonly asso-ciated with recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN),and principally affects the left side of the larynxarytenoid function at exercise is graded at A-C us-ing the Havemeyer system (Table 1), and it hasrecently been proposed to add an additional grade(D) to differentiate between horses with relativelystable arytenoids that are held in the cadaveric po-sition (C) from those which are unstable and are\"sucked\" across into the contralateral rims glotti-dis 22(grade D). Vocal-fold collapse is also catego - rized as a form of dynamic laryngeal collapse. Palatal Dysfunction Palatal dysfunction at exercise incorporates the syn-dromes of DDSP and palatal instability (PI). 9,23 Although diagnosing DDSP during over-ground en-doscopy is generally clear cut, diagnosing PI is rel-atively subjective. PI has been shown to negativelyaffect ventilatory parameters in exercising horses 24 and observation of PI is sometimes described asequivalent to a \"presumptive\" diagnosis of DDSP. 25 However, not all equine clinicians are in agreementthat the two disorders are linked, because DDSPmay occur without being preceded by PI. It is alsounclear what degree of exercise-related soft-palateinstability can be regarded as normal or physiolog-ical, and what percentage of horses diagnosed withPI on exercising endoscopy might experience DDSPunder different conditions, such as racing. Medial Deviation of the Ary-Epiglottic Folds This condition was previously referred to as axialdeviation of the ary-epiglottic folds, 26but it has now AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 311IN-DEPTH: INTERACTIVE CASE DISCUSSIONS - UPPER RESPIRATORYbeen suggested that medial is the correct term asaxial and abaxial should only be used with skeleton 27(Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria ). The ary-epiglottic folds in the horse do not have a muscular component to them, in con-trast with other species. Medial collapse is seen inhorses at fast work, can cause signicant obstruc-tion, 26and is often associated with other abnormal - ities such as DDSP.28 Nasopharyngeal Collapse Nasopharyngeal collapse has also been referred toasnasopharyngeal obstruction orpharyngeal wall collapse , and is characterized by ventral displace- ment of the dorsal wall of the nasopharynx or axialdisplacement of the lateral pharyngeal walls, occur-ring during early inspiration. 29It is rarely diagnosed as a standalone condition, being more frequently ob-served in complexes of upper airway obstructions. 30 It has also been implicated as a precursor to forms ofDDSP. 29In fact, DDSP has been considered a type of pharyngeal collapse (because the soft palate consti-tutes the ventral wall of the nasopharynx), along withcollapse of the nasopharyngeal roof and dorsal eleva-tion the epiglottis. 29A grading system for Boyle et al.30 Ventro-Medial Luxation of the Apex of the CorniculateProcess This describes the collapse of one corniculate processbeneath the contralateral one during resting and/orexercising examination. 31,32It has been suggested that this is an unusual manifestation of RLN, or anadvanced stage of adductor muscle dysfunction dur-ing the progression of RLN before full abductordysfunction is appreciable. 31Abnormalities of the interarytenoid ligament32or of the constitution of the corniculate process of the arytenoid cartilagehave also been proposed. Other Abnormalities Uncommon abnormalities that can be identiedwith exercising endoscopy include a range of dy-namic abnormalities seen as part of the laryngealdysplasia complex, cricotracheal ligament collapse,epiglottic retroversion, and intermittent epiglotticentrapment among others.

Introduction The challenge of laryngeal surgery is to create alarge stable airway that can be maintained underhigh negative pressures, while also maintaining thefunctional ability to close or protect the airway dur-ing swallowing. These somewhat-conflicting goalslead to the fairly high rate of complications associ-ated with laryngeal surgery relative to other types ofsurgery. This also makes resolving complications with laryngeal surgery more challenging. Likeany surgery, having a good understanding of thepotential sand traps can minimize the risk ofcomplications. 2. Recurrent Laryngeal Neuropathy One of the most common abnormalities promptinglaryngeal surgery is recurrent laryngeal neuropathy(RLN), often referred to as laryngeal hemiplegia.Determining a denitive diagnosis of RLN prior todeciding on a method of treatment may seem easybut can be difcult in the milder conditions. Mildarytenoid chondropathy and mild laryngeal dyspla-sia are frequently mistaken for RLN and if improp-erly diagnosed can lead to potentially inappropriatetreatment. A critical resting endoscopic examina-tion evaluating structure and function, in conjunc-tion with physical examination ndings are usuallyall that is necessary to make the correct determina-tion. Other ancillary procedures such as ultra-sonography or magnetic resonance imaging can behelpful if there is any question. 1,2Furthermore, dynamic endoscopy can be useful in determining thedegree of obstruction for any of the above-mentioneddisorders and will allow the abnormality to be seenin the appropriate context of the stress on the upperairway with the expectations for the horse postoper-atively. In other words, with dynamic endoscopyyou can see that a moderate degree of RLN based onresting endoscopy will likely result in less clinicallysignicant respiratory compromise for a jumperthan a racehorse. Yet, it should also be kept inmind that severity of the disease may progress overtime, and while a recommended treatment may beeffective at the initial evaluation, it may not beeffective several months later. Once a diagnosis of RLN is made, the proper course of treatment is still debated\u2014either by vocalcordectomy or a method of laryngoplasty. 3-5The reported success rate of the laryngoplasty varieswidely. 6-11Successful results vary depending on the outcome variable evaluated and the breed oroccupation of the surgical population. Thorough-bred racehorses generally have a lower success raterelative to non-racehorses, which is likely a reflec-tion of the relative demand on the upper respiratorytract. This difference in conjunction with the rela-tive risks and costs of the procedures will affect thedecision to pursue one treatment over another. 314 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIN-DEPTH: INTERACTIVE CASE DISCUSSIONS - UPPER RESPIRATORY NOTESComplications Associated with Laryngoplasty The likelihood of complications is signicantly re-duced with increasing surgical laryngoplasty expe-rience. A thorough knowledge of surgical anatomyand understanding of the mechanical forces involvedis essential for maximizing the probability of suc-cessful abduction. Despite this the most commoncomplication of laryngoplasty is loss of abduction. Loss of abduction can be seen in the immediate postoperative period, or progressively over severalmonths postoperatively. 9Intraoperative endos - copy during suture placement will allow for the de-gree of abduction to be carefully controlled. Alsoachieving abduction with a standing awake animalmay be benecial in assessing the degree of abduc-tion. 12Yet the degree of abduction achieved at surgery is an inexact science. Although greater ab-duction has been associated with a greater likeli-hood to return to work and improved performance ithas also been associated with higher rates of com-plications 7and there are several potential sources of immediate abduction loss. Suture pull-through atthe cricoid or muscular process variability are likelymost common. 13Regardless of the specic cause (which often can only be speculated with individualcases), a large percentage of horses are expectedto lose some abduction postoperatively. 9Methods have been implemented to minimize the postopera-tive abduction loss. 14 Postoperative aspiration is the next most common serious complication associated with laryngoplasty.Although the degree of abduction likely is a factor inthe risk of aspiration, surgical technique can alsoaffect the horse's ability to swallow appropriately.If a horse experiences aspiration in the immediatepostoperative period, particularly if there is \"exces-sive\" abduction, it is advised to allow time for ab-duction loss that may mitigate the problem. Ifaspiration persists, further procedures to protect theairway or reversing the laryngoplasty should beconsidered. 3. Epiglottic Entrapment Entrapment of the epiglottis with a fold of sub-epiglottic tissue is a common abnormal ndingin racehorses, and infrequently seen in non-racehorses. 15Although in non-performance horses it is usually associated with coughing; it is oftenassociated with poor performance in racehorses.Yet, thin uncomplicated entrapments in themselvesdo not cause signicant respiratory obstruction 16so there is some presumption that any poor perfor-mance subsequent to entrapments is associatedwith secondary intermittent displacement of the softpalate during exercise. 17Axial division of the en - trapping tissue without sub-epiglottic resection iscurrently advocated in most conditions. Laryngot-omy and excision of redundant tissue, which hasbeen performed historically, should be avoided inuncomplicated cases of entrapment due to a lowerpostoperative prognosis for racing successfully(27%) in comparison with axial division. 18There are multiple methods of surgical division, each withinherent risks. Surgical trauma to adjacent soft-tissue structures can be performance limiting, andinfrequently the entrapping membrane can result inepiglottic deformation that is performance limitingeven before any surgical intervention. 4. Arytenoid Chondropathy Arytenoidectomy is most commonly performed fortreatment of arytenoid chondropathy or less fre-quently for failed laryngoplasty. It is well acceptednow that a partial arytenoidectomy is the preferredform of arytenoidectomy with varying descriptionsof the technique and varying results. 19-22Success in racehorses is reported in 60-80% of cases.22-23 Experimental evidence shows that partial aryte- noidectomy closely restores most respiratorymechanics to normal, but not all respiratory pa-rameters are returned to normal. 19,24 The most common postoperative complication is poor performance. Poor postoperative performancecan be secondary to an inadequate airway and pos-sibly some degree of lower airway inflammationfrom dysphagia. Creating an adequately sized dy-namically stable airway without any aspiration ischallenging. Cytological evidence of lower air-way inflammation has been reported in almostall cases postoperatively. 19Presumably, surgical techniques that minimize soft-tissue damage willlimit the disruption to swallowing and decreasepostoperative dysphagia. Another factor whichcould adversely affect airflow is the presence ofintralaryngeal granulation tissue. Horses shouldbe evaluated postoperatively and any intralaryn-geal granulation tissue can be removed by tran-sendoscopic laser surgery at that time. Delay inremoving any tissue that is present may result ina more cartilaginous mass that is difcult to re-move at a later date. In one study that a mucosalflap was employed, 17% of the horses had intrala-ryngeal granulation tissue that warranted laserresection. 23 The nal postoperative complication that should be considered is airway noise during exercise.There is only one report that comments on noise inthe post arytenoidectomy patient. They reportabnormal noise in most patients. 21Given that even in the best case scenario the airway will nolonger have normal contour, it is not surprisingthat abnormal respiratory noise is present in theexercising horse. Clearly if there is extraneoussoft tissue that can dynamically deviate into theairway on inspiration the noise will be worse, butit is possible that the horse can still perform with-out signicant airway obstruction and soundabnormal.

Among the ancient Romans, the symbolsused for brands were sometimes chosen as part of amagic spell aimed at protecting animals from harm. 1 By the European Middle Ages, hot brands were com-monly used on cattle to identify ownership, espe-cially in nations with large cattle-grazing regionssuch as Spain. These European traditions were im-ported to the Americas and were further rened bythe vaquero tradition of the southwestern United States and included the branding of horses in orderto trace animals back to specic ranchers or owners.In the 1950s the federal government required iden-tication of animals being transported to differentstates. In the 1980s the United States AnimalHealth Association stressed that animals be individ-ually identied in order to trace them back to theowner in case of emergencies or disease outbreaks.Today, equine identication and traceability arecore fundamentals equine in-dustry. Identication is dened as the veriableevidence of a horse's identity. Traceability is de-ned as the ability to use individual unique identi-cation to track a horse in all areas of its life frombirth to death. 2 Accurate, veriable, permanent, unique individ- ual identication of horses helps to ensure the accu-rate registration of horses and ensures the rules of acompetition such as age or class restrictions for thehorse showing or racing are being met, promotessports integrity, which ultimately leads to consumercondence. Implementing accurate unique horseidentication on certicates of veterinary inspection(health assist in biosecurity and dis-ease-control efforts, specically enables governingbodies to rapidly identify horses that may have beenexposed to an infected horse at an event. In addi-tion, horse welfare is of the utmost importance to theindustry, and proper identication and traceabilityof horses enables authorities to hold horse ownersaccountable in cases of neglect and cruelty. Incases of a natural disaster or theft, properly identi-ed animals can be promptly reunited with theirowners when found. Verication of the horse'sidentication at the time of sale prevents fraud as itassures the buyer of the horse's true identity. Currently, there are multiple methods of equine identication, each with its own unique advantagesand disadvantages. Popular ones include ofcialidentication documents, such as breed registrationpapers, certicates of veterinary inspection, physi-cal description, photographs, lip tattoos, brands,DNA tests, iris scans, and microchips. According toa National Animal Health Monitoring SystemEquine 2005 study, the most common forms ofequine identication (ID) were registration papers Cog-gins tests papers (40.0% of operations and 27.2% ofequids). The least common forms of unique IDwere microchips (3.1% of operations and 1.5% ofequids). Freeze brand and hot-iron brand wereused as unique IDs on 13.8% and 12.2% of opera-tions. Of the 3.9% of operations that had \"other\"unique IDs, DNA and blood testing were commonforms of identication. 3 Physical description incorporates the horse's age, breed, sex, coat color, markings, whorls, cowlicks,scars, and chestnuts. One disadvantage of a phys-ical description as a unique identier is these fea-tures may be subjective and differ depending on whois describing the horse. Many times, written de-scriptions lack detail, which leads to ambiguity.In addition, many horses look alike as they may besolid colored with no distinguishing markings.Therefore, a written physical description would notbe sufcient in identifying individuals. For exam-ple, a written physical description is unable to dis-tinguish a group of 3-year-old black Friesian llies. Another method currently used to identify horses is branding with either hot-iron or freeze-brandtechnique. The hot iron is an invasive procedurethat produces a third-degree skin burn and localizedskin necrosis. 4Freeze branding utilizes a branding iron that has been chilled with a coolant such asliquid nitrogen or dry ice. Rather than burning ascar into the animal's skin, a freeze brand damagesthe pigment-producing hair cells, causing the ani-mal's hair to grow white where the brand was ap-plied. Freeze brands, if applied properly, cause lessdamage to the animal's skin than hot-iron brandsand are usually more visible. An advantage ofbranding is that it is relatively inexpensive and gen-erally difcult to alter. However, the techniquecomes with disadvantages, including pain, stress,and inherent safety issues associated with the pro-cedure. In addition, brands are sometimes un-sightly and difcult to read, and may be used toidentify an owner or registry, not an individualhorse. However, unique freeze brands have beenused by the Bureau of Land Management to identifyindividual horses and the United States TrottingAssociation has used unique freeze brands to iden-tify racing Standardbreds in recent years. Since the late 1800s, lip tattooing has been used as a means of identifying individual horses. Thismethod was adopted by the Jockey Club in the early1900s to eliminate cheating and is applied inside theupper lip of the horse. Lip tattoos are currentlybeing used in Thoroughbreds, racing Quarterhorses, and Standardbreds. A Thoroughbred tat-too has one letter, which indicates the year of birth,followed by four or ve numbers. Horses foaledoutside North America will also have an asterisk (*)at the beginning of the tattoo. A Standardbred tat-too always has ve characters, either a letter andfour numbers or two letters and three numbers.The rst letter in the tattoo indicates the year ofbirth. A racing Quarter Horse tattoo has four orve numbers followed by a letter, making it easy totell from a Thoroughbred tattoo. Some advantagesof lip tattooing are that lip tattoos are permanentand difcult to alter. However, the lip tattooingprocedure is invasive and has the potential to spreaddiseases, such as equine infectious anemia and equine piroplasmosis. In addition, as the horse ages, the liptattoo can fade and become difcult to read. There isalso a potential that a lip tattoo can be altered so thatthey are completely illegible. 5The Jockey Club has a free tattoo lookup and research service called Interac-tive Registration at www.registry.jockeyclub.com aswell as a Tattoo Frequently Asked Questions , which includes a video on how to read a lip tattoo. You canlook up a Standardbred tattoo online at https://pathway. ustrotting.com and you can get information aboutQuarter Horse tattoos www.aqua.com/racing/pages/ hoseman-info/tattooer/identier. Newer noninvasive techniques for equine identi- cation include iris scanning developed in 2000 byJapanese researchers. An infrared camera is usedto map the unique pattern of the iris of the eye, whichis then translated into an alphanumeric code. Thecode then serves as the horse's identication number.This technology is benecial given that it is highlyaccurate, noninvasive, and has a low probability ofbeing altered, except with damage to the eye. Unfor-tunately, the technology is relatively expensive andthere is limited access to reading equipment. DNA typing using hair samples is another com- monly used way of identifying individual horses.It is most commonly used by breed registries forparentage verication of foals. The DNA of eachhorse contains a unique genetic code that can bemeasured by gel electrophoresis and computer anal-ysis. The advantages of DNA individual horseidentication are accuracy and limited invasiveness.However, DNA testing is expensive and does notoutwardly identify the horse. Microchips are a relatively new form of individual unique horse identication that are highly accurate,convenient, with minimal risks of transmitting dis-ease and impossible to change. On the downside,they are invasive and microchip readers may beconsidered relatively expensive. However, micro-chipping could be the best technology for the futureof unique equine identication and as such are thefocus of this paper. 2. Discussion Veterinarians play an important role in microchip-ping horses as they are often called upon to insertthe microchips and often to register them. There-fore, it's important that they be knowledgeable onthe use and capabilities of microchips. This paperwill serve to provide that information. Microchipsused in horses come in various sizes and materialsbut share a common appearance. The structure ofthe microchip includes the E-Unit, or \"intelligent\"portion of the microchip, which consists of a passive 318 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIDENTIFICATION, TRACEABILITY, a Ferritecore. This component transmits the radio fre-quency signal, which is received and read by a mi-crochip reader. The E-Unit is housed within resinand a biocompatible material, such as glass or poly-propylene. Most of the microchips used in thehorse range in length from 8 to 13 mm and width of1.4 to 2.1 mm. The microchips are typically admin-istered using a 12- to 15-gauge needle, depending onthe specications of the microchip. A detailed viewof a standard equine microchip is detailed in Fig. 1. Equine microchips are radio frequency identica- tion devices (RFIDs) that are inactive until stimulatedby a microchip reader. Once the power button on themicrochip reader is pushed, it emits a low-frequencyradio wave that activates or wakes up the microchip. The microchip then responds by transmitting thenumber embedded in the IC unit and the number isdetected by the reader. This two-way communicationis classied as full duplex communication, which isdifferent from the half duplex, which is the one-way communication commonly found in cattle ID tags.Cattle ID RFID devices transmit a signal constantly. The radio frequencies utilized by the microchips in horses are low frequency, between 120 and 140 kHzthat can only be read by a scanner held within 10centimeters of the chip. In comparison, some live-stock RFIDs utilize the ultra-high frequency of 1GHz which increases read range distance to 15 /H11001feet. To assure quality in manufacturing of micro-chips, the International Organization for Standard-ization (ISO) and the International Committee forAnimal Recording (ICAR) developed a set of stan-dards for microchips used in animals. To be mar-keted as an ICAR/ISO-compliant microchip, the chipmust meet ISO Standards 11784 and 11785. ISO11784 references the microchip's unique numeric15-digit species how thetransponder activates and transmits information.The unique code structure consists of a header,which is used to assist the reader in nding themicrochip, an identication code, which includes theunique 15-digit code for the individual animal, and aseries of cyclic checks followed by an extension por-tion that can include other microchip features suchas biothermal data or data storage. This codestructure is illustrated in Fig. 2. The identication code contains the manufacturer or country code (three digits), followed by a uniqueidentication code (12 digits). The 15-digit code re-layed to the reader represents the unique individualhorse identication number. Each country has acountry code, which for example is 840 in the UnitedStates, 276 in Germany, 056 in Belgium, etc. If themicrochip is not correlated with a specic countrycode, a manufacturing code beginning with 9 is used.The 900 code is a designated shared code, and 999 isused for research or special use. Due to the poten-tial for duplication numbers and the lack of associ-ation with a specic country or manufacturer, theuse of shared 900 manufacturing code microchips inhorses is discouraged. The 15-digit microchip con-taining a 12-digit identication code is guaranteedto be unique in ISO-certied chips and can thereforebe veried as a unique identication code for theindividual horse that receives the microchip. ICARcompliance also requires that microchips can beread by all ISO readers at 134.2 kHz, ensuring thatinformation is standardized and universally avail- Fig. 1. Common equine microchip structure.

To manu-facture with the ICAR Certication ofConformance. This requires that they test the mi-crochips at an ICAR-approved testing center andhave signed the Code of Conduct to respect ISOregulations. It is important to note that not allmicrochip manufacturers are ICAR certied, andare therefore not required to meet ISO standardsand so it is important to ensure that an ICAR-certi-ed microchip is being used. According to a 2015 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Baseline Reference of EquineHealth and Management in the United States Sur-vey, which was conducted in 28 states and included71.6% of the equine population, only 3.4% of equineoperations containing 1.6% of the equine populationuse microchips as an identication method. 6Al- though this population is small today, large equineorganizations such as the United States HunterJumper Association and The Jockey Club are begin-ning to mandate the use of microchips for perma-nent equine identication. 7 With the growing use of microchips in horses, there are many decisions to be made regarding stan-dardization of the practice. One topic up for debateis the use of country-coded vs manufacturing-codedmicrochips. The use of an 840-coded microchip(country coded) would provide some assistance inequine traceability, since these microchips can betraced to the United States. Ofcial 840 micro-chips fall under the jurisdiction of the USDA, whichrequires ofcial 840 microchips that meet the ISO/ICAR standards. The use of ofcial 840 microchipsin the United States requires registration of thepremise prior to the time of implantation. Al-though the premise ID requirement is benecialfrom a traceability standpoint, the concept has stim-ulated pushback in the equine industry given thatmany horse owners are reluctant to share personalinformation, such as their physical address. Enti-ties such as breed registries and racing venues haveworked around the issue by assignment of micro-chips to the premises of the breed registry or theracetrack. This eliminates the assignment of themicrochips to the horse owner's premises. The useof microchips with the manufacturing code begin-ning with a \"9\" does not require a premise ID.These microchips trace back to a specic manufac-turer instead of the premise where it was adminis-tered. Microchip numbers beginning with 9 couldbe tied to the horse's registration papers, show pa-pers, Coggins tests, etc. and could be led with thebreed association. Given the permanence of microchips once im- planted into a horse, correct implantation techniqueis important. Currently, guidelines for microchipimplantation are intended for administration by vet-erinarians or in accordance with state laws. Inmost cases, sedation is not required, although localanesthesia applied prior to implantation is oftenutilized. Prior to inserting the microchip, it is im-portant to scan the horse rst to identify whether amicrochip has already been implanted. A universalreader should be used that can identify various fre-quencies, and the user should be familiar with thereading distance of the reader. The horse should bescanned along the left side of the horse's neck frompoll to withers in a parallel and perpendicular mo-tion that includes the entire neck. Be aware thatsome Thoroughbred racehorses in Canada have themicrochip inserted in their upper lip so that areasshould be also scanned in these horses. If a micro-chip is not detected, the technician can move for-ward with the microchip administration. Correctmicrochip administration technique is outlined asfollows: 1. Scan microchip inside packaging to ensure correct code. 2. Identify correct placement in the nuchal liga- ment on the left side of the neck, halfwaybetween the poll and withers, and approxi-mately 1.5 to 2 in below the mane. 3. Aseptically prepare the implantation site.4. Remove administration needle from packag- ing and remove needle cap with bevel facingup. 5. Insert needle perpendicularly to the horse as an intramuscular injection. 6. Once completely inserted, depress plunger and remove the needle. 7. Scan the horse again to ensure correct micro- chip placement. Some minor health concerns are possible followingmicrochip administration, including pain or inflam-mation at the implantation site and migration of themicrochip. These health factors have been investi-gated in several research projects. In 2007, Gerberet al 8investigated the inflammatory and pain re - sponse associated with microchip administration.Skin temperature, swelling area, and pressurethreshold were measured for 2 weeks following im-plantation of a microchip. Results of the study in-dicated swelling and sensitivity were apparent forup to 3 days following microchip implantation. 9 Another study by Gerber et al investigated migra-tion probabilities of microchips at 1, 2, 4, and 6months after implantation. 8Radiographs measur - ing the distance between the most cranial point ofthe fourth cervical vertebrae and the microchip in-dicated the microchips did not migrate. A similarstudy by Stein et al 9investigated the incidence of microchip migration in horses, donkeys, and mulesover a 4-year period. There was no evidence ofmicrochip migration at the conclusion of the study. 9 Therefore, investigations indicate that microchipadministration yields minor pain and inflammationat the injection site and microchip migration should 320 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIDENTIFICATION, TRACEABILITY, AND BIOSECURITYbe minimal following the correct implantation in ahorse. An additional feature available in some microchips is temperature-sensing technology. Currently, mar-keted equine Biothermal microchips are canalso report an animal's body temperature wheneverthe device is scanned. The original technologyyielded inconsistent results, so the chip has beenrecalibrated to improve accuracy. The currenttechnology is calibrated to an ideal temperature of38\u00b0C to give more consistent readings. A study byLanger and Feitz 10evaluated the reliability of mi - crochip temperature readings when measured every30 seconds. Results indicated that the accuracywas within 0.07 /H110060.12\u00b0C. 10Similar studies per - formed in foals and performance horses yielded sim-ilar results. Anecdotal reports by veterinariansusing thermal chips indicate that ambient temper-ature and direct sunlight on the horse may affect theaccuracy of thermal chips and should be taken intoconsideration when recording results. Given thatbiothermal chips can be scanned frequently withease and are accurate in demonstrating tempera-ture changes over time or trends, they are a valuableoption as a monitoring tool for equine health. 3. Conclusions At a recent US Animal Health Associating and Na-tional Institute of Animal Agriculture sponsored Equine Identication Forum attended by representatives fromthe breed associations, regulatory agencies, veteri- narians, owners, and microchip companies, the gen-eral consensus was that now is the time to advanceequine identication and traceability. The attend-ees also agreed the identication technology andsoftware to manage data from microchips is avail-able and ready to be used but there is little supportfor a national database. Rather, individual breedsand disciplines will be charged with maintainingshow/race records. There was support for a searchengine much like that used by the American AnimalHospital Association in small animals, that would al- low input of the horse's microchip number in order toconnect horses lost due to theft or natural disasterwith their owner. The presentations and white paperfrom the forum can be found at https://animalagricultrure.org/proceedings/equineidforum. A work-ing group has been formed to identify, develop, and im-plement a strategy for advancing equine identication.

Although the safety, practical-ity, and usefulness of this practice has been wellestablished, there is little information availableabout the actual traceability of equine microchips inthe long term. Given that the life span of horsestoday is generally quite long, often up to 20 years ormore, and that the percentage the U.S. horse popu-lation over the age of 20 years is steadily increasing(now comprising up to 11.4% of the total popula-tion), 1it is clear that long-term traceability of equine microchips is necessary now and in thefuture. Reasons for needing to trace a specic equine microchip at this time are limited, but vital whenencountered. State and federal animal-health of- cials often need to use the microchip of a specichorse involved in a disease investigation to trace thehorse's history and potentially identify additionalexposed horses or equine premises. First respond-ers to natural disasters who are tasked with collect-ing and managing displaced equids have signicantchallenges in identifying ownership of horses inthese situations and need the traceability of micro- chips to return these animals to their rightful own-ers. Individuals searching for a lost or stolen horsehave a critical reliance on the potential traceabilityof equine microchips for the purposes of having theirhorse found and returned to them. Equine rescuegroups often encounter horses that have lost theiridentity and endeavor to trace any unique identi-cation associated with the horse, be it a brand, atattoo, or a microchip in an effort to restore thehorse's identity and uncover its history. The current methods available for tracing an equine microchip are also limited, which presents asignicant challenge. The scenarios described aboveeach begin with someone scanning the horse in ques-tion and obtaining a unique microchip number. But what is the individual to do with this numbernow? How does one go about tracing this micro-chip? If the phenotype or known history of thehorse itself presents some clue as to a specic breedregistry or discipline group that might have infor-mation connected to the microchip, then that is oftenthe best place to begin a search. If, however, thereis no known entity with which to begin the inquiry,then the individual is forced to begin at the beginning;with the manufacturer of the microchip. Most com-monly, the rst three digits of the microchip numberwill indicate the manufacturer of the chip. The nameand contact information for the manufacturer can be obtained online by looking up the three-digit code on 322 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP Web site. 2Upon contacting the manufac - turer, a service representative can provide the searcher with the name and contact information for the distributor or company to which the manufac-turer sold the microchip. The searcher must thencontact the distributor or next entity in line andobtain the name and contact information for thegroup to whom they next sold the microchip and soon down the line until an actual entity is identiedthat maintains specic data on the horse in whichthe microchip was implanted. Successful traceback of an equine microchip relies upon whether the searcher ultimately reaches anentity that had conrmed specic information aboutthe horse in question and how long it actually took toacquire that information. Several case studies ofactual attempted microchip traces are presentedherein to demonstrate the current status of equinemicrochip traceability in the United States. 2. Case Study 1 A load of 10 adult horses in a trailer was interceptedin south Texas by the U.S. Department of Agricul-ture (USDA)-Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS)-Veterinary Services (VS) in theprocess of being smuggled across the Texas-Mexicoborder. The horses were noted to be in poor bodycondition and the examiners were unable to agree onthe likely breed of the horses, but routine radiofre-quency identication (RFID) scanning as part of theexamination revealed that most of the horses wereimplanted with microchips. The horses were con-scated and tested glanders, protocols. All tested for Theileria equi , an etiologic agent of EP, for which horses presented at ofcialimportation are rejected entry. The horses wereeuthanized as a result, but tracing of the microchipswas attempted by APHIS-VS as part of the Investi-gative and Enforcement Services investigation ofthe illegal movement to ascertain the origin of thehorses and potentially other individuals involved inthe illegal movement. Online lookup of the three-digit prexes of the microchips on the ICAR Web site led to identica-tion of the manufacturer. 2Contact of the manufac - turer by phone provided the identication of thedistributor of the microchips, a company located inEurope. Telephone and email contact with the dis-tributor in Europe revealed that the microchips hadbeen sold to a breed registry in Spain, the AsociacionNacional de Criadores de Caballos (ANCCE) registry's Web site to nd contact infor-mation for the group led to identication that theregistry had an online microchip lookup page ontheir Web site. 3Search of the microchip numbers through the lookup page conrmed the interceptedhorses to be registered Spanish PREs, born in Spain,with several of the horses pictured at ofcial showsin Spain just 2 years prior to their being interceptedin Texas. This traceback was considered fully successful in that the entity with conrmed information on theindividual horses was located and the time it took toacquire the information beginning from the rst con-tact with the manufacturer was approximately 4days. In addition, this particular traceback was eventually responsible for uncovering a long-standingroute of illegal movement for Spanish PREs into theUnited States and also led to the identication oftwo additional EP-positive horses in California thathad been previously smuggled from Spain via Mex-ico. The discovery that microchips of Spanish PREs registered with this particular breed registrycan be directly searched on the registry's Web sitewas an additionally valuable piece of informationshould a microchipped horse with that suspectedbreed lineage and no other history available be en-countered and need to be traced in the future. 3. Case Study 2 A grade stray horse was intercepted by APHIS-VSpersonnel on the Texas-Mexico border and physicalexamination including RFID scanning revealed thepresence of a microchip. Although the horse wasultimately conrmed to be test negative for the U.S.import diseases of interest, it was necessary to tracethe microchip in an attempt to locate the owner ofthe horse. With no obvious indication of a specicbreed registry or other entity which may hold infor-mation on the stray horse, the traceback was begunwith the manufacturer of the microchip. The man-ufacturer name and contact information was ob-tained by online lookup of the three-digit prex ofthe microchip number on the ICAR Web site. 2Tele- phone contact with the manufacturer yielded thename and contact information of the distributor towhich the microchip was sold. Telephone contact with the distributor led to sev- eral problems with continued traceback. First, thedistributor asked if the microchip in question was a2-mm chip or a 4-mm chip. Upon being informedthat we did not know the size of the microchip andthat it could not be visualized because it was stillimplanted in a live horse, the representative for thedistributor was surprised by this information. Hethen claried that the microchip in question was awildlife microchip and was intended to be implantedinto a sh. This was the rst instance we hadidentied in which a microchip intended to be im-planted into a different species was actually found ina horse. In addition, the distributor indicated thatthis particular chip was rather old and pre-datedtheir current company software by several itera-tions. In fact, the chip could only be searched in anoutdated computer that the company kept in anunused corner of the ofce and which only the ownerof the company knew how to access. Given that theowner of the company was only present in the ofce AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 323IDENTIFICATION, TRACEABILITY, AND BIOSECURITY1 day per week, arrangements were made for thechip to be searched in their old computer on anotherday and a callback was promised. Unfortunately,the callback 2 weeks later conrmed that the micro-chip was not found in the database of the old com-puter system and was deemed untraceable at thatpoint. The time to determination that the micro-chip was untraceable was 2 weeks and the owner ofthe stray horse was never determined. 4. Case Study 3 A cluster of 17 EP-positive bushtrack (unsanctioned)Quarter Horse racehorses was identied on a prem-ises in Tennessee with iatrogenic transmission con-rmed as the source of spread through the owner/trainer's repeated reuse of an IV administration setbetween horses. Traceback of each of the infectedhorses to their previous owners/trainers/premiseswas needed in an attempt to identify not only theoriginal source of the infection in the cluster, butalso to nd other horses that may have been previ-ously exposed and required testing. In addition tolip tattoos present in some of the infected horses,two of the horses were also found to have micro-chips. Although most of the infected horses weresuspected to have been ofcially registered as foalswith the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA)and the horses with lip tattoos were likely to alsohave previously been active in sanctioned QuarterHorse racing, all of the horses had since lost theirAQHA registration papers and registered namesalong the way. Traceback of EP and/or EIA- infected racehorses has been most effectively carriedout the past few years using registered names ofhorses and online race history lookup through Equi-base. 4Without the registered name of the infected horse, the nding of previous owners and trainersand ultimately identication of other exposed horsesthat need to be tested is often unsuccessful. In this case scenario, the quickest and most effec- tive way to approach individual traceback of theinfected horses in question was via the lip tattoos.Contact directly with AQHA for identication of theregistered names of some of the horses with liptattoos was conducted and a few of the horses wererestored to their ofcial identication through thismethod. The time to conrmation of a horse's iden-tity through lip tattoo was very short and took usu-ally only 1-3 hours. Unfortunately, several of thehorses with lip tattoos had evidence that their tat-toos had been specically altered and/or tattooedover previously in an apparent attempt to change orconceal the identity of the horse. Most of the horseswith altered lip tattoos could not ultimately be iden-tied or traced. Individual traceback attempts onthe two horses with microchips present is outlinedbelow. Case Study 3A Traceback on the microchip of the rst horse beganwith online lookup of the manufacturer on the ICARWeb site using the three-digit prex of the microchipnumber. 2The manufacturer provided information that the chip had been sold to a veterinary supplycompany which they knew to have since gone out ofbusiness. The manufacturer then provided thename and contact information for a second veteri-nary supply company that was known to have bought out the original veterinary supply company.Contact with the second veterinary supply companywas difcult and circuitous; it took discussions withfour different employees at the company over sev-eral days before an individual was identied whoknew anything about the equine microchips beingsold. It was then ascertained that no records fromthe original veterinary supply company were main-tained by the new company and the chip beingsearched was deemed to be untraceable beyond thatpoint. Out of curiosity, a query was made regard-ing whether the current veterinary supply companywould be able to provide information on any of thespecic microchips they currently sell. The answerwas that the company maintained absolutely no re-cords indicating to whom a specic microchip orseries of chips was sold. Thereby, any microchipsold through this particular veterinary supply com-pany would be immediately rendered as furtheruntraceable. Case Study 3B Traceback on the microchip of the second horse like-wise began with online lookup of the manufactureron the ICAR site using the prex ofthe microchip number. 2The manufacturer pro - vided the name and contact information of a smallprivate distributor to whom the chip was sold.The distributor had no staff to answer the phone anda voicemail message was left for return contact,which occurred the next day. The distributor hadexcellent records and was able to provide the nameand contact information for the veterinary practiceto which the microchip had next been sold. Contactwith the ofce manager at the clinic revealed thatthis was a small mixed animal practice and that noelectronic medical records on any of the patientswere kept, so the microchip number could not besearched electronically. The ofce manager offeredto have the veterinarian return the call to investi-gate the matter further. Since the state in which the veterinary practice was located is known to be one that uses microchipsin connection with a state EIA program, an addi-tional call was placed to the state animal healthofcial's ofce in the hope that a search of the statedatabase might locate the chip in question. A quicksearch of the state's database system yielded nomatches to the microchip number being sought.When information was provided about the reportedveterinarian likely involved in placing the chip, thestate veterinarian commented that that particularveterinarian often did not send in their paperworkto properly record the chip with the state. 324 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIDENTIFICATION, TRACEABILITY, AND BIOSECURITYThe veterinarian did return the phone call the following day, but was ultimately unable to locateany records associated with the microchip that hehad purchased and implanted presumably for anofcial state EIA program. Even given additionalinformation about the horse, whose registered nameand previous owners had actually already been as-certained through his lip tattoo number, and thepotential date range in which the veterinarian likelywould have seen the animal, he was unable to ndanything in his paper medical records that matchedthe horse. So, the traceback of this microchip number also reached a dead end with approxi-mately 1 week lapsing from the beginning of thetrace to the time when the chip was determined tobe untraceable. 5. Conclusions from the Case Studies The above case studies and many similar attemptsat tracing equine microchips for state and federalregulatory purposes over the past few years havehighlighted some signicant challenges. There aremultiple parties involved in and expectedly respon-sible for keeping records associated with the life ofan equine microchip. Failure to either keep ortransfer records at any single step in the pathwayyields a permanent dead end to the traceability ofthe microchip, rendering it almost essentially use-less. So far, the best outcomes in tracing a micro-chip have been achieved when the end informationis maintained by breed registries or other equineindustry groups that have a vested interest in con-necting data for the individual horse to its uniqueidentication. Although in nearly all instances,contact with the manufacturer has been successfulin obtaining the next distributor or entity to whomthey sold the specic microchip, traceback in a step-wise manner beginning at the chip manufacturer istime consuming and is not practical in the event ofan urgent traceback need, such as a highly conta-gious disease outbreak. The revelation that somemicrochip manufacturers are not meeting their in-ternational industry standard of requiring their dis-tributors to maintain records on each microchip soldis a crippling inadequacy that must be rectied.Finally, it seems clear that a publically accessibleinteractive online microchip lookup tool for equinemicrochips is desperately needed to streamlinethe traceback process. Such a lookup tool couldprovide quick identication and contact informa-tion of the ofcial entity or group (breed registry,discipline group, state/federal program, etc.) thatmaintains information related to that particularmicrochip number while maintaining the securityand condentiality of that data until a specicrequest or need is presented and considered forinformation disclosure. 6. The Future of Equine Microchip Traceability In January 2017, the National Institute for AnimalAgriculture and the U.S. Animal Health Associationjointly hosted an Equine Identication and Trace-ability Forum in Denver, Colorado. More than 100individuals attended the forum representing stateand federal animal health ofcials, microchip man-ufacturers and distributors, and leaders of equineindustry organizations. Although a comprehensivesummary of the meeting outcomes are still forth-coming, overall conclusions included that micro-chipping should be the goal for universal equineunique identication and that this goal should bean equine industry-driven initiative. Also pre-sented was the idea that individual equine indus-try entities or \"silos\" should maintain and protecttheir own data and that an online equine micro-chip lookup tool indicating which \"silo\" or \"silos\"maintains the data pertaining to that microchipwould be a safe and effective method for microchiplookup and traceback. Several equine industry initiatives have already begun which support these long-term goals. TheJockey Club has implemented microchipping as arequirement of registration for Thoroughbredfoals born in 2017 and thereafter. The U.S.Equestrian Federation has a series of initiativesproposed which will eventually require a micro-chip for participation in their sanctioned events.The U.S. Trotting Association is conducting a testprogram to use microchips for identication ofStandardbred racehorses in place of the currentlip tattoos or freeze brands. Other breed and dis-cipline groups are entering into active discussionsregarding the future of equine microchips as partof their programs. Also now available is an online equine microchip lookup tool created by Microchip ID Systems, Inc.and intended in the future to be hosted by animpartial third party outside of the microchip-manufacturing industry. 5This lookup tool is publically available and accessible online free ofcharge. Although the current version of the lookuptool is not yet linked to any equine industry data-bases, it does now provide one-step access to thename and contact information for the manufacturerof the microchip number being searched without theneed to visually search the list of manufacturercodes posted on the ICAR Web site. In the future, it is hoped that equine industry groups would allow for their databases to be securely \"pinged\" by themicrochip lookup tool in search of a specic micro-chip number. If the number is found, the lookuptool could display the equine industry group nameand contact information whereby the searcher coulddirectly contact the group and request assistancewith tracing of a specic microchip. Above all itmust be recognized by the equine industry that sim-ply implanting microchips in horses is not enough.There must be maintenance of data and structure oftraceability built-in behind the microchips for theirintended purposes PROCEEDINGS TRACEABILITY, AND BIOSECURITYAcknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veteri- nary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

Ultimately, collaboration and communication on biosecurity betweenequine private practitioners and the equine industry are essential for protecting and promotingthe health of the U.S. equine population.

Thesebiosecurity practices target the ecology of the animaland human population, the characteristics of thepathogen, or the complexity of environmental evolu-tion and diversity. Veterinarians should routinelyperform biosecurity practices to decrease risk of dis-ease transmission (i.e., cleaning and disinfection ofequipment between uses, properly disposing of nee-dles and syringes after single use, performing handhygiene, and assuring the cleanliness of footwearand clothing); however, these individual actions arenot currently recognized as the standard of practicesby all members of the equine industry. 1,2 Trends in equine management are transitioning to expansive transportation of horses and intensivecommingling of horses in conned spaces that haveundoubtedly increased the risk for introduction andtransmission of infectious agents. In evaluatingthe industry need for enhanced biosecurity at equineevents, it is useful to consider the 2011 equine her-pesvirus-1 (EHV-1) multi-state outbreak associatedwith horses having attended National CuttingHorse Association Western National Championshipin Ogden, UT. According to the U.S. Department ofAgriculture, Animal Plant Health Inspection Ser-vices, Veterinary Services, published case-controlstudy, the risk of equine herpesvirus myeloencepha-lopathy (EHM) increased with the increasing bios-ecurity risks while at the Ogden Event. Some ofthe cited biosecurity risks included horses being tiedin the barn, use of shared water, and use of commu-nal wash racks. 3 Biosecurity risks are not limited to equine events, but are also prevalent at large equestrian facilities.The January 2003 outbreak of the neuropathogenicstrain of EHV-1 at the University of Findlay'sEquestrian Center highlights some additional bios-ecurity risk factors associated with large equestrianfacilities, such as changes in horse populations, un-restricted movement of horses within a facility, andenvironmental conditions leading to reduced venti-lation in shared air space. Both incidents demon- 63 importance of biosecurity measures toprotect the horse, to eliminate the infectious agent,and to improve the environmental conditions. 4 The equine industry has always recognized the veterinarian as the trusted resource for informationand guidance related to the health of the horse. 5 The veterinary practitioner has a unique opportu-nity to educate the industry on the need and benetof biosecurity plans. Equine veterinarians nowhave an expanded role in protecting the health ofhorses by performing biosecurity risk assessments,developing and implementing biosecurity plans, androutinely evaluating the plans. The intent of this paper is to provide guidance and resources related to performance of biosecurity riskassessments, identication of appropriate biosecu-rity measures, and evaluation of biosecurity mea-sures. The paper will provide guidance on routinebiosecurity and enhanced biosecurity measures nec-essary for a disease outbreak investigation. 2. Biosecurity Risk AssessmentGeneral Considerations Similar to a physical exam of an individual horse, afacility can be assessed to determine the biosecurityrisks it has based on current practices. The ulti-mate objective of a biosecurity risk assessment of a farm or event is to identify potential points of diseaseagent entry and potential points of disease-agenttransmission on the premises. A risk-assessment site visit should include evaluation of the following: Premises layout Infrastructure and design (stabling, storage) Standard operating procedures (documented and observed) Equine turnout and exercise routines Equine movement within the facility Equine movement onto and into the premises Visitors and service providers to the operation Practices for delivery of feed and removal of manure Water and feed sources Control of wildlife and insects/ticks Planning Risk Assessment Visit Every facility is unique, so a biosecurity risk assess-ment requires a dedicated appointment for an onsitevisit and assessment. All involved parties shouldunderstand the importance of the assessment, theobjectives of the assessment, and the plan for theassessment. Key personnel to include in the riskassessment site visit are listed below. The facility owner The facility manager The event manager (for event grounds) Employee supervisors Since the risk assessment will include observationsof daily practices on a farm, the facility manager orowner may consider notifying employees, trainers,horse owners, and riders of the planned site visit.Involvement of all stakeholders enhances stake-holder buy-in on the ultimate plan. The veterinar-ian should schedule and allot adequate time for thebiosecurity assessment. The length of appoint-ment will be dependent upon the size of the prem-ises, the number of personnel to interview, and thecomplexities of facility management. The clientshould understand that the objective is to observecurrent routine practices, so practices should notchange before or during the assessment visit. 6 Before entering the premises, consideration must be given to the disease agents of concern; this is ofimportance for determining potential entry pointsand mechanisms of spread. Is the client interestfor a biosecurity plan for one disease, such as equineherpsesvirsus-1, a plan for all endemic contagiousdiseases of concern, such as strangles, influenza,and equine herpesvirus-1, or a plan for equine for-eign animal diseases, such as African Horse Sick-ness? The more inclusive and complex the needs ofthe plan, the greater the time investment necessaryto address the disease agent entry and transmissionpoints. Clearly outlining the parameters at thestart of the visit will ensure that the nal writtenbiosecurity plan will meet the client's need. Veter-inary knowledge and expertise are valuable, socharging for the time conducting the assessment,identifying and recommending biosecurity mea-sures, and implementing the biosecurity plan is appropriate. A published article provides recom-mended pricing structure for work associated withbiosecurity risk assessment and biosecurity plandevelopment. 7 Approach to On-Site Risk Assessment The objective of the on-site risk assessment is toidentify potential disease entry points and potentialmechanisms for disease spread on the premises.Knowledge of the general transmission routes for thedisease agent(s) of concern is useful during the assess-ment. Development of a systematic approach to the risk assessment assures evaluation of all criticalareas. The \"follow-the-horse approach\" starts with the arrival of the horse on the grounds and follows thehorse through the facility until its departure fromthe facility. As management of horses may varyfrom trainer to trainer or by horse discipline, it maybe necessary to follow several horses to determinethe extent of the risk. This assessment approach issuccessful for evaluation of the equine eventgrounds during the show. However, care must betaken when evaluating an event grounds duringnon-competition times as the assessment is thenbased on assumption that the reported standardpractices actually occur during an event. For a farm, ranch, or boarding facility evaluation, the basis of the systematic approach may be ongeographic divisions of the property or the manage- 328 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSIDENTIFICATION, TRACEABILITY, AND BIOSECURITYment divisions (i.e., divisions by trainer or owner).It is important to evaluate all areas of the premises,including grazing areas, pastures, turn-out facili-ties, hay elds, feed storage locations, and equip-ment storage areas. The client copy of the nal risk assessment report should include documentation and photographs ofkey observations made during the site visit. 3. Performing Risk Assessment The transmission routes of the disease agents ofconcern are the basis for the various ways a diseasemay enter an equine premises. Once a diseaseagent gains entry to an equine premises, there maybe various modes for disease transmission. Criticalassessment for potential entry points of diseaseagents include the horses, animals, wildlife, people,trucks, equipment, feed, and supplies. Knowledgeof the modes of disease transmission for the diseaseagents of concern is the basis for the premises riskassessment, which includes evaluation of the facilitylayout, the horse health protocols, points of animal-to-horse contact, points of human-to-horse contact,protocols for handling of manure, soiled bedding,hay handling and disposal, feed storage and han-dling procedures, trafc control, and recordkeeping. Disease Agent Entry Risk Assessment Based on the transmission routes of the diseaseagents of concerns, there are various ways for thedisease agent to enter the premises. Key aspects toassess include the following: 1.Horse entry: Any horse entering the premises can be a potential source of disease agent entrygiven that the horse could be shedding the dis-ease agent if precautions are not taken to man-age the potential risk they pose. Whenassessing the risks of horse entry, the goal is todocument the following:a. The origin of horses entering (i.e., sales auc- tion, equine event, private facility, etc.) b. The mode of entry (i.e., transported onto premises or ridden onto the premises) c. Documentation requirements for entry to the premises (i.e., certicate of veterinaryinspection, owner/agent health declaration,etc.) d. Diagnostic test requirements for entry to the premises (i.e., equine infectious anemia(EIA) test, strangles testing, etc.) e. Entry inspection protocols (i.e., physical ex- amination of horse upon entry), and f. Destination stabling for newly arriving ani- mals (i.e., isolation stabling, designated sta-bling with cohort animals, any open stall,etc.). 2.Other animal entry : Animals entering the premises can act as mechanical or biologicalvectors. Document observations of the loca-tion and number of pets, feral animals, live-stock, poultry, and feral animals. Identifyand document potential points of animal entryto the facility, such as incomplete perimeterfencing, lack of an entry gate, a consistentlyopen entry gate, or regular shipment of live-stock or poultry. 3.Wildlife entry: Wildlife, such as rodents, birds, wild cervids, opossums, and raccoons may carrydisease agents onto the premises. Assessmentand documentation for wildlife entry should besimilar to domestic animal entry. 4.Human entry : Many people visit equine prem- ises each day. Accurately recording the catego-ries of people that enter the premises is essentialfor identifying potential sources of disease-agentintroduction. Typical categories of people enter-ing an equine facility include the horse owners,facility employees, veterinary professionals(veterinarians, technicians, and assistants),horse-care professionals (groomers, massagetherapists, chiropractor, farriers, dentists, etc.),industry representatives (nutritionists, phar-maceutical representatives), and supply deliv-ery personnel (feed, shavings, hay). 5.Vehicle entry: Vehicles can carry a disease agent to a premises on the tires, on externalsurfaces, or in the load being carried. Obser-vation and documentation of vehicle entry on tothe premises should be performed for all thecategories of personnel that enter the premises. 6.Equipment entry: Contaminated equipment can carry a disease agent on to a premises. Ob-servation and documentation of equipment en-tering with all categories of personnel should bedone. 7.Feed, hay, and supplies entry: Contaminated feed, hay, or supplies can carry a disease agenton to a premises. Documentation should in-clude the source of feed, hay, and supplies, andany requirements for evaluating quality ofthese products entering the premises. 8.Water sources: Surface water presents a po- tential for risk because quality is difcult toassess and control, i.e., streams, irrigationditches, lakes, ponds, etc. Disease Agent Transmission Risk Assessment Once a disease agent gains entry on to an equinepremises, there are various modes of disease trans-mission. Knowledge of the modes of disease trans-mission for the disease agents of concern is the basisfor the facility disease agent transmission risk as-sessment. 1.Facility layout: A complete biosecurity as- sessment of the facility should include thefollowing: a. Assessment of stalls (i.e., location, number, size, construction, sanitation, extent of horse-to-horse contact, etc.) AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 329IDENTIFICATION, TRACEABILITY, BIOSECURITYb. Availability of an isolation area (i.e., loca- tion, access, suitability) c. Feed and water areas (i.e., location, storage, access, handling) d. Communal areas (i.e., location, separation, access, sanitation, construction, sanitation,extent of horse-to-horse contact, etc.) e. Exercise areas (i.e., location, separation, ac- cess, sanitation, extent of horse-to-horsecontact, etc.) f. Parking areas (i.e., location, access, separa- tion, signage). The assessment report shouldinclude a map of the venue, which designatesstables, fence lines, trafc flow, water sources,and parking. 2.Horse health protocols: Horses shedding in- fectious disease organism on the premises are arisk to the other horses on the premises. Toidentify potential disease organism transmis-sion risks, assess existing protocols for main-taining horse health plans, monitoring horsehealth, and isolating sick horses. 3.Animal-to-horse contact: Assess the stabling area, paddocks, pastures, wash racks, and exerciseareas for the potentials for horse-to-horse contact. Additional consideration should be given tolocations where other animals have potentialfor direct contact with horses on the prop-erty. Document the locations for animal-to-horse contact and describe the frequency andduration of the contacts. 4.Human-to-horse contact: The transmission risk depends on the frequency, duration, andlocation of contact (i.e., muzzle, head, neck,etc.). The frequency and duration of humaninteraction varies across equine proper-ties. For example, employees responsible forcleaning stalls and/or feeding horses interactdirectly with multiple horses on a routine ba-sis, whereas a trainer may interact directlywith a subset of the population. To ensurecomplete assessment of potential transmissionrisks, the report should document any contactswith a horse on the property. 5.Manure, soiled bedding, and hay dispos-al: Given that manure, soiled bedding, and hay have the potential to transmit disease or-ganisms, the handling and disposal of theseproducts influences disease transmission risks.Document the protocols and frequency of ma-nure, soiled bedding, and hay removal from thestall, their delivery to the holding area, andtheir removal from the property. 6.Feed storage and handling: Contamination of feed or hay with an infectious disease agentduring the storage and handling of product isalso possible. Evaluate feed and hay storagearea location, security, and level of sanitation.Assess employee feed distribution protocols fordisease transmission risk factors.7.Trafc: The movement of trucks, trailers, tractors, golf carts, wheelbarrows, and bicyclesaround an equine premises have the potentialto spread infectious disease agents. Evaluatethe types of vehicles and wheeled equipmentthat move around on the premises, the fre-quency of vehicle use, the locations of vehiclemovements, and the sanitation practices on thevehicles. 8.Recordkeeping: Review facility records for horse movements (entering, remaining on, and exitingthe premises), location of individual animals, andhorse health status procedures (monitoring andtreatment records). 9.Written protocols: For large operations with multiple employees, determine whether thereare written instructions on what to do if thereis a febrile horse, a horse with nasal dischargeor a horse with signs of abortion, horses dis-playing diarrhea or neurologic disease on thepremises. Assigning Risk Levels After identication of risk factors, classify the risksas high, medium, or low risk. The basis for theassignment of level of risk should be the potentialfor disease introduction and spread. Assignmentas high risk would suggest that there is a very highlikelihood of disease entry or spread, whereas a low-risk assignment would suggest there is a low likeli-hood for disease entry or spread. For example,stabling an arriving horse that has a nasal dis-charge and temperature of 102\u00b0F in the main sta-bling area would be a high-risk practice with a highpotential for disease agent entry and transmission.Stabling the arriving horse with nasal discharge anda temperature of 102\u00b0F entry in the isolation areawould be a moderate-risk practice, given that thereis potential for agent entry to the premises, but thedisease transmission risk is signicantly lower withthe current biosecurity protocol for isolation. 4. Implementing Biosecurity Measures for IdentiedRisksGeneral Considerations Disease risks are inherent when animals commin-gle. The assessment may identify transmissionrisk areas that cannot be eliminated by a practicalday-to-day routine biosecurity mitigation program.It is not feasible to eliminate all disease risks at anequine facility completely, so the client must deter-mine the acceptable level of disease risk for theirpremises; the practitioner can then develop a risk-tolerant plan with policies and procedures suitableto attain the appropriate level of biosecurity. Im-plementing biosecurity measures to address risksmay require a signicant expenditure of nancialand human resources. An enhanced biosecurityplan, for implementation during an infectious dis-ease outbreak, can address the biosecurity gaps. 330 2017 /H11408Vol. section recommen-dations resources to address the identied risksthrough implementation of biosecurity measures forroutine use and/or in response to a disease outbreak. Routine biosecurity measures generally focus on limiting horse-to-horse contact, limiting human-to-horse contact, avoiding sharing of equipment, tack,and grooming supplies unless cleaned and disin-fected between uses, monitoring horse health, andisolating horses with clinical signs of disease. En-hanced biosecurity measures during a disease out-break require stricter enforcement of all the routinemeasures and implementation of more costly andtime-consuming disease-barrier precautions anddisease-control measures. Case Scenario This scenario focuses on practical, implementable,real-world biosecurity measures for routine use andfor use during a disease outbreak. The example:a large boarding facility with stabling for 700 horsesin three stabling areas. On the facility, there weresome private boarders as well as horses afliatedwith 21 horse trainers.Routine Biosecurity Measures Stabling: There were designated separate stabling areas for each trainers' horses. Eachtrainer attempted to house horses by risk-levelgroup (i.e., young horses in training, schoolinghorses, and show horses that travel). Eachgroup is typically handled in order of risk. Feeding and cleaning equipment: There were color-coded feed buckets, water buckets, muckbuckets, and rakes for each designated trainer/area. The color coding was either with tapeapplied to the items or with use of differentcolored items (i.e., buckets, rakes). The colorcoding was a visual deterrent to help preventaccidental sharing of equipment. Grooming equipment: There were some color- coded or labeled individual pieces of groomingequipment in the tack room or on the stall doorfor each horse. Some equipment was sharedand was cleaned and disinfected between use. Routine health monitoring: Some trainers maintained daily logs for horse temperatureand treatment. Personnel: Some stabling areas had dedi- cated personnel to handle each group of train-ers' horses. If that was not possible, frequentuse of hand sanitizer and cleaning of boots wasrecommended. Disease Outbreak-Enhanced Biosecurity MeasuresAn EHM case was conrmed stabling area onthe premises and enhanced biosecurity measureswere required to control the disease. Ensuringhorse health and business continuity were critical toall trainers on the property. The intent of this sec-tion is to provide insight on the type of enhancedmeasures implemented during a disease outbreak. Restricted access in stabling area: A physical barrier separation prevented access of peopleand additional bisoecurity signage was postedwith restrictions (Fig. 1). Restricted entry of horses: Initially, horses were not allowed entry into the affected sta-bling areas on the premises. However, horsescould enter stabling areas with no known in-fection. Horses were required to remain intheir designated stalls and to request permis-sion to change stalls (Fig. 2). Designating exercise areas: Restricted exer- cise of horses in affected barns to designatedareas with limitations on the number of horsesin the exercise areas at one time. Restricted human access: Access to the af- fected stabling area was restricted to person-nel directly responsible for the care andtraining of the horses in that stabling area(Fig. 3). Individuals were not permitted to Fig. 1. Restricted access in stabling area. Fig. 2. Restricted entry of horses.

Checkpointswere set up to log personnel movement in andof the affected stabling area. All personnelentering and exiting were required to use footbaths, disinfectant spray, and hand sanitizer. Restricted dog access: No dogs were permit- ted in the horse-stabling areas. Dogs on thepremises were restricted to paved parking lotareas. Monitored horse health: Temperature monitor- ing of all horses was required two times eachday. The temperatures were noted on the tem-perature logs posted on each stall door. Person-nel monitored temperature logs daily to ensurethat horse temperatures were being re-corded. Elevations in horse temperatures were discussed with the attending practitioner. Sick horse isolation: Any horse with a tem- perature at or above 102\u00b0F and any horse dis-playing neurologic signs was immediatelymoved to a temporary isolation stabling areaset up in a parking lot (Fig. 4). The perimeterof the isolation area was fenced off and onlydesignated personnel dressed in disposablecoveralls, disposable boots, and gloves werepermitted to enter the isolation area. Strict cleaning and disinfecting protocols im- plemented: (Fig. 5) Thorough cleaning and disinfection of equipment, stalls, trailers, andvehicles were required to ensure disease con-tainment at the time a suspect or conrmedtest positive exposed horse was identi-ed. Tack, bridles, grooming equipment, andbandages were also exposed to direct sunlightto reduce risk of virus survival. Re-routing, cleaning, and disinfection of vehi- cles: All feed, hay, shavings, and manure trucks were rerouted to prevent disease trans-mission from high-risk stabling areas to low-risk stabling areas. To contain the virus,trucks were cleaned and disinfected betweenstabling areas. Access of vendor trucks: Local vendors who were aware of the situation were reluctant toenter the premises. Delivery protocols toclean and disinfect trucks upon entry and exitwere implemented. Vendor personnel wouldalso use disposable coveralls and disposablefootwear covers when delivering supplies (i.e.,grain, hay, supplements, bedding). Equine service providers: Protocols were imple- mented to permit service providers such as far-riers to enter the premises. The farrierappointments were made for the end of the far-rier workday, so the affected facility was the laststop for the farrier. Farrier parking was re-stricted to the premises perimeter. Work wasdone in the stabling area, with cleaning and dis-infecting of all equipment between horses andwith the farrier required to change clothes be-tween horses. Disposable coveralls and bootswere made available for service providers. Biosecurity oversight: Trained personnel were designated to continually walk through Fig. 3. Restricted human-access area.

Biosecurity Resources and Supplies The American Association of Equine Practitioners(AAEP), the U.S. Equestrian Federation, and the Amer-ican Quarter Horse Association are encouraging theequine industry to work with their veterinarians to implement biosecurity plans. Historically, biosecu-rity assessments and plans focused primarily onequine veterinary hospitals. Practitioners are nowbeing asked to develop biosecurity plans for venuesand large equine facilities. What biosecurity re-sources are available for the veterinary practitioner?The AAEP Web site has biosecurity resources thatare reviewed at least annually and updated asneeded based on new information and lessonslearned. Under the Infectious Disease ControlGuidelines, there are specic biosecurity guidelines,which address the risks and biosecurity measuresdiscussed in the previous section. Ideally, routineand enhanced biosecurity protocols documents areput in place before a disease outbreak given thatthese are difcult to produce in a timely mannerwhen other disease control issues take priority. Isolation of a sick horse is the most important immediate action necessary during a disease out-break. It is essential to identify potential areas forisolation of a sick horse in an area away from theremainder of the equine population. Most equineboarding facilities lack appropriate isolation sta-bling and may require construction of a temporarypipe coral isolation pen in a parking lot. Identi-cation of a source for pipe corral fencing is essential.Isolation of a sick horse may require off-site isola-tion stabling. Advance sourcing of such appropri-ate alternate stabling in your area will allow forrapid isolation of a sick horse and decrease potentialdisease transmission risks. Vacant horse stables,vacant livestock facilities, empty vacated supplysheds, or local fair county fairgrounds may be avail-able for use in these situations. Contacting ownersof such facilities in advance and maintaining a cur-rent available list of optional housing areas for iso-lation is recommended. Large facilities should prepare in advance for set- ting up an isolation area. The Center for EquineHealth at the University of California-Davis pro-vides valuable guidance on this topic in a documenttitled, \" How to Set Up a Disease Isolation Unit at Farm or Horse Show \" (https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ ahfss/animal_health/pdfs/S.pdf). Large facilities should have a biosecurity supply kit available for an emergency disease outbreak sit-uation. The kit should include disposable gloves,disposable coveralls, disposable boot covers, andpossibly disposable head covering. 8The supply kit should include a disinfectable (or disposable) halterand lead rope, grooming equipment, water and feedbuckets, and a thermometer for clinical high-riskhorse(s). For barrier protection, the supply kit shouldinclude a foot bath container, appropriate disinfectant,a boot brush for cleaning soles for the boot, and trashbags. Table 1 provides a list of biosecurity supply kitsupplies and potential sources. 6. Summary The equine industry is recognizing the need to imple-ment biosecurity measures, particularly at equineevents and large boarding facilities. The future ofequine practice includes the provision of services fordisease risk assessments with recommendations for best management practices and implementation ofbiosecurity measures. Assessments and imple-mentation of routine biosecurity measures willdecrease the potential for disease incursion. Devel-opment of plans and identication of resources forenhancement of biosecurity in the event of diseaseincursion will facilitate the timely control of a dis-ease incident.

Introduction Sound is a type of acoustic energy produced by vi-brating bodies and propagated by various transmis-sion media in the form of sound waves. 1These waves are longitudinal (plane) and have a sinusoidalshape as well as four generic properties: period,frequency, length, amplitude, and velocity. The human ear can detect sound waves with frequenciesbetween 20 Hz (20 cycles per second) and 20 KHz(20,000 cycles per second). 2Sound waves that have frequencies above 20 KHz are categorized as ultra-sound waves, whereas waves that have frequenciesbelow 20 Hz are categorized as infrasound waves.Wavelength is the distance traveled by sound withinone cycle. This parameter is inversely proportionalto frequency. The amplitude or height of the soundwave is correlated with the intensity of the signal.Strong or loud sound signals are created by soundwaves of high amplitudes. Velocities vary depend-ing on the density and compressibility of the me-dium through which the sound wave is traveling.Medical imaging uses ultrasound waves with fre-quencies between 1 MHz (1 million cycles per sec-ond) and 20 MHz. 3These waves are produced by the piezoelectric effect (from the Greek, piezein,t o squeeze or press),4namely the ability of certain non- conducting materials to generate an electric chargein response to applied mechanical stress (pressure-electric or squeeze-electric). Disk-shaped piezoelec-tric crystals (elements) change their volume andvibrate when an electric current is passing throughthem, which causes the media in front of them todeform and vibrate, thus producing ultrasoundwaves. 5In this way, electric energy is translated into mechanical energy. The same crystals are physicallycompressed by the incoming ultrasound wave (echo),which causes a voltage change on the electrodes aswell as an electric impulse. Four main modes of ultrasonography are used in veterinary medicine: A-mode, acoustic signal penetrates the evaluated tissuesand returns as an echo displayed on the monitor asa horizontal waveform. 2The amplitude changes in accordance with a degree of the acoustic mismatch of AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 335BACK TO BASICS: MAKING THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICE NOTEStwo media (tissues) at their interface, in variousdepths. This mode has rather limited applicationsand is occasionally used to detect fluid-lled structuressuch as the conceptus in pigs and small ruminants.The most frequently used mode of ultrasonography isB-mode, or brightness mode. A two-dimensional im-age consisting of a collection of dots (pixels) is dis-played on the monitor. The brightness of each dotindicates the amplitude of the reflected (returning)wave, which is proportional to the difference in theacoustic impedance of the two materials (media). 1 M-mode, or motion mode, allows us to visualize themovement of the selected objects graphically. Nu-meric measures can then be objectively derived fromthis graph, such as heart rate. Finally, D-mode, orDoppler mode, uses the Doppler phenomenon to dis-play blood vessels in colors (red and blue) of variousintensity correlated with blood flow velocity. To ob-tain accurate measures of blood flow velocities andindices of tissue perfusion, spectral Doppler or pulse-wave Doppler modality needs to be available as well. 2. Equipment A large variety of stationary and portable machinescan be used for various applications in equine prac-tice. However, portable units are more commonlyused in equine reproduction, given that mares areoften examined in the barn in eld conditions.Battery-operated units can be used in places whereelectricity is unavailable. The majority of ultra-sound machines have several modalities that can beactivated when needed: B-mode (basic, most oftenused), M-mode (usually present a basic version),and D-mode (usually optional). The \"best\" ultra-sound machine for equine practice is dependent on anumber of considerations. Each veterinarian mustrecognize his/her own needs, priorities, and applica-tions to identify the most suitable machine for theseparticular uses. Some machines are simple to useand have numerous pre-programmed settings butlack manual setting options. Although these ma-chines are user friendly, they do not allow for cus-tomized/sophisticated settings or advanced imageprocessing. Other machines have many options,manual settings, and post-processing packages butare more difcult to operate, which could be a prob-lem for less advanced operators, especially in eldconditions. The main part of the ultrasound machine is the transducer, which emits ultrasound waves to tissuesand receives a returning echo. The two basic typesof transducers are mechanical and electronic. 2 In mechanical transducers, one or more crystals ro-tate or oscillate. These constantly moving objectstend to wear faster than the elements in electronictransducers. Hence, mechanical transducers arerarely used. Electronic transducers, by contrast,are more popular and provide a better-quality im-age. In array transducers, up to several hundredelements are arranged in a linear (linear trans-ducer) or curved fashion (curvilinear or convextransducer) and connected to a multichannel trans-mitter/receiver (Fig. 1, A and B). A subset of ele-ments is \"red\" at once to form a single beam (singleline). The next subset is \"red\" immediately afterthe rst one and so on. In this way, the entire areaof interest is consistently swept from one side toanother to form a two-dimensional image, which ischanging in \"real time.\" The shape, direction, andlocation of the ultrasound beam can be controlledelectronically without using mechanical parts. Bycontrast, in phase array transducers, all the ele-ments are \"red\" at all times, and the beam issteered electronically in different directions tosweep the entire area of interest (Fig. 1C). 5Linear transducers (probes), which produce rectangular im-ages, are most commonly used for transrectal exam-inations of the reproductive tract of mares andstallions (Fig. 1A). During these examinations, thelinear transducer is placed almost directly on theregion of interest such as a mare's ovary or uterus tovisualize the ne details of its structure. It thengenerates ultrasound waves of high frequency (5 to10 MHz on average). Although these waves gener-ate images of high axial resolution, they are atten-uated quickly and thus do not penetrate deeply.Sector transducers (curvilinear/convex or phase ar-ray) produce fan or pie-shaped images that offer abroad view of structures from a small area of contact(Fig. 1, B and C). These transducers are most often Fig. 1. Distribution of piezoelectric elements and direction of their activation in three different ultrasound transducers: (A) lineartransducer; (B) curvilinear/convex transducer; 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: MAKING THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEused to evaluate late pregnant mares, with a focuson the fetal and placental structures. They mustgenerate ultrasound waves of low frequencies (2 to 4MHz on average) that penetrate deeply, even up to35 mm. The tradeoff of such deep penetration is alow-resolution image. Smaller curvilinear trans-ducers (micro-convex) are occasionally used inequine reproduction for the evaluation of the scrotalcontents in the stallion or the mare's reproductivetract (small \"nger transducer\"). The main role of the console of the ultrasound machine is initiating, receiving, and processing ul-trasound signals. The electric signal is ampliedand converted by an analog or digital converter intoa two-dimensional image that consists of numerouspixels or dots. The brightness of this grayscale im-age depends on the amplitude of the returning sig-nal (echo). 5 Dense tissues are strong reflectors and create a bright image; on the contrary, less dense tissues areweaker reflectors and the resulting image is darker.Structures lled with clear fluid do not create anyecho; these are called anechoic, echolucent, ornonechogenic. They appear on the screen as black.The best examples of these structures are ovarianfollicles or early embryonic vesicles (Fig. 2). Allother images are echogenic and consistent withdenser tissues, which send an echo of the ultrasoundwaves back to the transducer. They appear as acollection of pixels in different grades of gray. Verydense tissues will appear almost white (hyperechoic)and tissues with low density will show as very dark(hypoechoic). Some tissues cannot be penetratedby ultrasound waves and their structures cannot bevisualized given that the entire pulse is reflectedback to the transducer. Good examples of thesetissues are bones (Fig. 3). 3. Optimizing Ultrasound Images Simple ultrasound machines have only a few knobsand buttons or keys on the consoles that allow forbasic adjustments of monitor brightness, signalgain, image depth, freezing and saving images, aswell as taking measures of various objects. Othermachines have more elaborated consoles with nu-merous knobs for manual settings. Regardless of atype of the machine, monitor brightness should beadjusted rst before any other settings are changed.This should start from setting brightness to its high-est level, followed by turning brightness down grad-ually until the darkest level on the gray scale barbecomes black. The next step of setting up theultrasound machine is adjusting gain. There is nospecic way of doing it correctly, each ultrasonogra-pher adjusts it to his/her liking. Increasing gainresults in processing of more incoming echoes by theultrasound machine, thus producing overall brighterimages. 6There is usually one knob to decrease or increase an overall gain, as well as two or moreknobs to adjust neareld and fareld gain sepa- rately. Many machines have time gain compensationsystem with ve to 10 sliding knobs, similar to anequalizer on a stereo, which allows for very subtleadjustment of gain in specic areas/layers of the im-age. It is recommended that the top (neareld) knobis set off center to the left, with next knobs graduallymoved toward the center and then off center to the Fig. 2. Ultrasonographic image of early equine pregnancy (14days): (1) hypoechoic embryonic vesicle; (2) uniformly of echo below the embryonic vesicle(artifact); (4) specular echoes (artifact). Fig. 3. Ultrasonographic image of the fetal chest in late preg-nancy: (1) images of the fetal ribs; (2) shadowing generated bythe fetal ribs. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 337BACK TO BASICS: MAKING THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEright. In contrast with the neareld, the fareldneeds high gain due to attenuation of the signal athigher depth. 7Unexperienced ultrasonographers have a tendency to use too high gain, which leads toloss of contrast and ne details on the image, as well asto increased production of noise and artifacts. Depthof the image is often changed several times duringeach examination. Too shallow depth is not recom-mended. An area of interest should be visualized atapproximately 3/4 depth of the screen, with enoughspace for useful artifacts (shadowing or enhancement),just below this area. Many ultrasound machineshave an option to manually control location of the focalzones, dynamic range, and gray maps. It is impor-tant to make sure that an area of interest is within thefocal zone, which provides the greatest lateral resolu-tion of the image. 6This can be obtained by adjusting depth of the image or changing position of the focalzone. Many machines have an option to add one, two,or more focal zones. However, this results in de-creased frame rate and \"jerky\" flow of images on thescreen. Another important parameter, which is es-sential in achieving desired quality of the ultrasoundimages, is dynamic range. High value of dynamicrange is consistent with a wide range of shades of grayand overall smooth image. Low value of dynamicrange means that there is a low range of shades ofgray, which appears as a higher contrast on the image.Dynamic range is often called \"compression.\" The lastof the most common adjustments of the ultrasoundimage is a gray map, which determines brightness ofeach shade of gray on the image. 4. Artifacts The interpretation of ultrasound images is relativelyeasy for an inexperienced ultrasonographer; how-ever, many artifacts, or the articial results of im-aging technology, can be misleading. 8Therefore, a basic knowledge of the most commonly occurringartifacts on ultrasound images is necessary for prac-ticing veterinarians. Initially, a specular echo in early equine embryos was interpreted as an embryonic disk, and onlymuch later this misinterpretation was discovered 9 (Fig. 2). This artifact occurs when a beam strikes asmooth surface, wider than the beam, parallel to thetransducer. 8A small part of the beam is reflected back to the transducer, producing a strong echo,while the rest travels through the tissue (fluid in theovarian follicle, uterine cyst, or embryonic vesicle)and strikes another reflecting surface at the bottomof the structure. In this way, two specular echoesare produced as bright straight lines. Shadowing effects are often seen on ultrasound images (Fig. 3). These are produced either by thecomplete blockage of the ultrasound signal, or by itsdeviation (reflection or refraction). This phenomenonoccurs when there is a signicant difference in theacoustic impedance of two media at their interface.The acoustic impedance (z) of different tissues dependson their density (p) and compressibility or stiffness (k):z/H11005/H20844 (p /H18528k). 1Bones are good examples of materials with high impedance whereas air has very low imped-ance. Therefore, there is little or no transmission ofthe ultrasound wave through the soft tissue/air or softtissue/bone interfaces. Almost entire ultrasound sig-nal is reflected back to the transducer, and a shadow iscreated just below the interface of the two media. 1 A shadow is also produced as a result of reflectionof the ultrasound beam to the surrounding tissueby a spherical structure such as the ovarian folli-cle. 6Part of this beam is often refracted into a fluid-lled structure, contributing to shadow for-mation as well. If the signal travels through theanechoic structure, such as an embryonic vesicleor an ovarian follicle, it is not subjected to atten-uation like the signals traveling through echo-genic tissues. Therefore, an echo coming fromunderneath the early embryonic vesicle is stron-ger (i.e., it has a higher amplitude) than that fromother tissues (uterine wall) on both sides (Fig.2). 8,9Although many other artifacts can be dif - cult to interpret, the above-described effects arecommonly seen during the reproductive examina-tion of the mare. 5. New Developments In the past decade, new technologies such as har-monic and spatial compound imaging have been introduced to eliminate artifacts, decrease the\"clutter\" in near surface tissues, and reduce the\"noise\" level. 3There are two components in har - monic imaging: the rst harmonic (original fre-quency wave) and the second harmonic (a wavefrequency that is twice the original). The returningsignal is the combination of these two signals thatforms one \"distorted\" wave. The ultrasound sys-tem processes each component separately, whichprovides more information than regular imaging.In spatial compound imaging, the beam is steered invarious directions, thus scanning the same areamultiple times. The echoes from these different di-rections are compounded together into a single im-age. In this way, the image is less \"grainy,\" andhas higher resolution and fewer speckles.

Pozor, DVM, PhD, DACT The ultrasound evaluation of the reproductive tract of the mare has become an integral part of aroutine reproductive evaluation. Ultrasonography is used for daily evaluations prior to and afterbreeding, as well as for assessment of pregnant and postpartum mare. This paper describes thecommon ultrasonographic ndings in equine reproduction. Author's address: Department of LargeAnimal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL32611; e-mail: pozorm@ufl.edu. \u00a9 2017 AAEP. adds to the ndings gath-ered by other methods of clinical evaluation, but alsoprovides valuable information that an equine prac-titioner cannot obtain in any other way. Therefore,it is imperative that all equine veterinarians thatwork in reproduction equip themselves with an ul-trasound machine for everyday use. Having saidthat, ultrasonography cannot replace skilled man-ual palpation of all the structures of the reproduc-tive tract. The complete manual palpation \"perrectum\" of the ovaries, uterine horns, uterine body,and the cervix has to be performed before the ultra-sound examination. The ideal setting for this pro-cedure is proper restraint of the mare in stocks,preventing the operator from injury due to kicks.Even with the mare restrained in stocks, cautionstill has to be taken since some mares tend to \"sit\"during examination, which can injure the operator'sarm. If stocks are not available, a mare is posi-tioned at the door of the box stall, with her hind legsslightly outside the stall door. The door frame par-tially restrains the mare's movement and the oper-ator stands beside the mare's hip while palpating.A twitch can occasionally be used to further immo-bilize the mare. Light tranquilization is applied ifnecessary; however, one should keep in mind thattranquilization will affect the uterine tone. Prior toultrasonography, the mare's rectum has to be com-pletely evacuated of fecal material using a copiousamount of lubricant; the lubricant also must be usedto allow the penetration of the ultrasound beam.A thorough palpation of all the structures of the repro-ductive tract is always performed before the ultra-sound evaluation. After localizing all the structures of the reproductive tract and assessing their sizeand texture as well as the presence of normal andabnormal structures, the probe is introduced intothe rectum. The transducer must always be cov-ered dorsally by examiner's hand and movedslowly to avoid traumatizing rectal mucosa or caus-ing rectal tear. The examiner moves his/her handwith the transducer from one structure to another 340 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: MAKING THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICE NOTESslowly and smoothly, making sure that the entirereproductive tract is continuously and consistentlyscanned. A thorough exam is particularly impor-tant during pregnancy diagnosis when the entireuterus has to be visualized to nd a mobile embry-onic vesicle and diagnose early twin pregnancy.During the ultrasound evaluation of the uterus, thetransducer is usually held in a position parallel tothe long axis of the animal. Given that the equineuterus is T- or Y-shaped, the image of the longitu-dinal section of the cervix and uterine body is visu-alized. The uterine horns are visualized in theform of a series of cross sections, whereas the ovariesare visualized from the medial side when the probeis slightly turned sideways. 2. Physiological Changes in the Reproductive Tract ofthe Mare The ovaries are dynamic organs that undergo cyclicchanges during estrous cycles. Active ovaries con-tain follicles of different sizes. Multiple small fol-licles may be present on one or both ovaries, one ortwo dominant follicles are found during estrus, andsome found duringdiestrus. Subordinate during thefollicular phase. Several days before ovulation, adominant follicle reaches a size of approximately 25mm. It appears as a fluid-lled anechoic structurethat consistently increases its size until ovulation.The average growth of the pre-ovulatory follicle is 3mm per day, 1,2until 1 to 2 days before ovulation when the follicle rarely increases its size any fur-ther. Occasionally, a slight decrease in size may beobserved on the day of ovulation. The ovulatingfollicles in the mare are broad in size (20 to 70 mm);however, the majority of light breed mares ovulatewhen their follicles reach a diameter between 40 and45 mm (rarely when their diameter is less than 35mm). 2-5Friesian mares grow larger follicles thanother breeds, reaching 52 mm at 48 hours prior toovulation. 6Individual mares tend to ovulate the same size follicle from cycle to cycle. Changes in follicular diameter and other charac- teristics can be accurately assessed by using ultra-sonography (Fig. 1). The diameters of the ovarianfollicles are obtained by using calipers to monitortheir growth. 7In addition, changes in shape can be easily assessed. Pre-ovulatory follicles in the marelose their round shape and become irregular, devel-oping a \"point\" or \"cone\" toward the ovulation fossaand may have a slightly thickened follicular wall(Fig. 1, C and D). The shape changes due to adecline in antral fluid pressure shortly before ovu-lation. 8The avascular granulosa layer of the follic echogenic in the pre-ovulatory follicles, whereas appear as anechoicband. 9,10Color Doppler signals are strong within the anechoic band, and their intensity increase dailyas the follicle matures. However, an abrupt de-crease in blood perfusion of the follicular wall occursa few hours before ovulation, as shown using colorDoppler ultrasonography. 11The rectal palpation of pre-ovulatory follicles reveals a softening textureand increased sensitivity. Ovulation in the mare may be abrupt (60 seconds), or gradual (6 to 7 minutes). 2As a result, the follic - ular fluid is evacuated, but the follicular cavity mayll up with blood or a mixture of follicular fluid andblood soon afterward, forming a corpus hemorrhagi-cum (CH). Therefore, the actual collapse of thefollicle is rarely observed during ultrasound exami-nation. During the rectal palpation of the CH, asoft and sensitive indentation can be felt. In someinstances, however, a follicle-like structure is felt,which is difcult to differentiate from the pre-ovulatory follicle without the aid of ultrasonogra-phy. The ultrasonographic images of the CH in Fig. 1. Ultrasonographic images of the ovarian follicles in mares: (A) multiple, small follicles; MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEmares are variable.7The most typical ultrasono - graphic appearance of a fresh CH is spider web-like(blood clot), but it could also be uniformly echogenic(Fig. 2). A fresh CH may look almost like a follicle,but with numerous hyperechoic spots or bands.The luteinization of the ovulated follicle occurs granulosa cells in the mare), the corpus lu-teum (CL) is formed, progesterone is secreted by theluteal cells, and a mare enters the luteal phase(diestrus). The uterus undergoes changes concurrently with the ovarian activity. During estrus, ovarian folli-cles produce large amounts of estrogen and a mare'suterus develops a pronounced edema of the endome-trial folds (Fig. 3B). A uterus with estrous edemaappears on the ultrasonographic image as an \"or-ange slice\" or \"cartwheel.\" Occasionally, the exam-iner can see a small amount of anechoic intra-luminal fluid, which is normal during estrus. Theintensity of the uterine edema subsides approxi-mately 24 hours before ovulation (Fig. 3C). A mature CL in the mare cannot be detected by palpation. Ovulation occurs only in the ovulationfossa, and therefore the CL is completely buriedwithin the ovary. However, the introduction of ul-trasound has allowed the accurate detection of ovu-lation as well as of the development of the CH andCL (Fig. 4). The CL usually appears as a uniformlyechogenic, even hyperechoic, roundish structurewith or without a central cavity (Fig. 4, C and D).A blood clot in the center may persist throughout theentire luteal phase of the cycle or become progres-sively smaller to nally disappear. Progesteroneconcentrations are closely associated with the amountof luteal tissue, which can be objectively measuredusing ultrasonography. The cross-sectional area ofthe CL decreases progressively in mares during latediestrus in parallel to changes in progesterone concen-trations. 12These changes can also be observed sub - jectively during frequent ultrasound examinations.Furthermore, changes in vascularization of the CL canbe evaluated using color Doppler ultrasonography.It was shown that a decline in the luteal blood flowduring diestrus proceeds changes in concentration ofprogesterone, which can be useful in practice in earlydetection of failing CLs. 13 Follicular growth is also observed during diestrus. Each follicular wave has one dominant follicle and anumber of subordinate follicles. 2The follicular wave occurring during estrus and producing an ovu- Fig. 2. Ultrasonographic image of CH. Fig. 3. Ultrasonographic images of equine uterus in different stages of the estrous cycle: (A) mild edema on the beginning of estrus;(B) pronounced edema in mid-estrus; (C) decreasing edema 63 /H11408AAEP OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICElating follicle is called the primary wave, and thenext wave (during diestrus) is called the secondarywave. There are occasions when the secondarywave does not occur. The dominant follicle of thesecondary wave may regress, ovulate, or the large follicle, either by palpation or by usingultrasonography, is not evidence that the mare is inestrus. Other signs of heat must be found to con-rm that the mare is ready to be bred (positiveteasing by the stallion, uterine edema, and relaxedcervix). Breeding a mare that has a large follicleduring diestrus is still a relatively common errorand should be avoided. Additional follicular wavesmay also occur during diestrus in mares withoutproducing a dominant follicle and these are calledminor waves. Progesterone production affects uterine tone and ultrasonographic appearance in the mare. Theuterus becomes toned, the uterine edema disappears (Fig. 3D), and the cervix elongates and closes. Acharacteristic hyperechoic line is visible on the im-age of the longitudinal section of the uterine body,which is the effect of the interface of the uterinewalls. 7No fluid should be visible in the uterine lumen at this stage of the cycle. The above-described changes in equine ovaries and in the uterus, occur during the breeding season.Ovarian activity is less regular during the transi-tional period, which happens in the fall and spring. 2 In the fall, mares undergo a seasonal decrease inovarian activity, which ends in an anestrous period.A similar situation happens in early spring whenthe length of daylight increases and a resurgingphase occurs, followed by the transitional period;then, regular ovarian activity restarts. Duringearly transition, mares' ovaries are signicantlylarger than during normal breeding season. Thishappens due to the large number of follicles, whichstart developing rapidly (Fig. 5). At rst, these fol-licles have a mean size smaller than 20 mm in di-ameter. Later in transition, some follicles grow topre-ovulatory sizes ( /H1102235 mm), whereas others re- gress. Some follicles may even grow to 60 to 70 mmin diameter. This emergence of new follicles andthe regression of others occurs until one dominantfollicle nally ovulates. It is difcult to assesswhen a transitional mare ovulates for the rst time.Therefore, only the detection of the rst ovulation inthe season, by either using palpation with ultra-sonography (detection of the CL) or measuring pro-gesterone concentration ( /H113502 ng/mL), is proof that the mare is through the transitional period and hasjust entered the breeding season. During transi-tion, the uterus has a variable texture on palpationand an echotexture on ultrasonographic images.Initially, it is often small and flaccid, but later de-velops a massive edema, which may be present for a Fig. 4. Ultrasonographic images of corpora lutea: (A) fresh fluid lled cavity; (D) mature CL with small central cavity. Fig. 5. Ultrasonographic image of the transitional ovary 63 /H114082017 THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICElong time or come and go multiple times. The mareis under the influence of estrogens produced by mul-tiple follicles, and no progesterone is produced bythe CL. Therefore, mares usually show signs ofestrus for a prolonged period of time. In contrast with transitional periods, anestrus is a quiet time for the ovaries. During this phase, ovu-lations do not occur. In fact, anestrus is dened asextending from the last ovulation of the ovulatoryseason to the rst ovulation of the subsequent ovu-latory season. 2It is a common belief that mares' ovaries are almost completely inactive duringanestrus. However, the numbers and sizes of ovar-ian follicles may still change, except that none ofthem grow to the pre-ovulatory size. Ovarian folli-cles rarely exceed 10 to 15 mm in diameter duringthis stage of mares' reproductive cycle. 2During anestrus, a mare's uterus is flaccid, does not havetone, and does not develop a uterine edema. Infact, the uterine wall is so thin that it may be dif-cult to palpate it rectally. In addition, it has anirregular appearance on the ultrasonographic im-age, being pressed by the abdominal contents. Incontrast with the anestrous ovary, an inactive ovaryhardly has any follicles at all and the ovaries are very small. This nding in sexually maturemares may be due to malnourishment or chromo-somal abnormalities. 3. Abnormal Findings in the Reproductive Tractof the MareOvarian Abnormalities Anovulatory FolliclesSome dominant follicles continue dur-ing estrus, become abnormally large, and do notovulate (Fig. 6). They may even reach 60 to 100mm in diameter. In contrast with transition, whenthis is a normal process, these events should notoccur during the breeding season. Initially, anovu-latory follicles have a normal texture and ultrasono-graphic appearance, indistinguishable from thenormal ovulatory follicle. Later on, numerous hy-perechoic reflections in the shape of small specklesor a spider web-like structure are seen in the an-echoic fluid 7,14(Fig. 6). These reflections may cor - respond to bloody contents (as in the CH shortlyafter ovulation) or may represent the onset of follicles often continue hav-ing hemorrhagic contents (hemorrhagic anovulatoryfollicles), which form a blood clot and do not signif-icantly change their ultrasonographic appearance orsize for a prolonged period of time (nonuniformlyechogenic contents, numerous hyperechoic reflec-tions that do not move during the ballottement ofthe follicle). 15Others slowly luteinize (without ovulation) and may look similar to the CL with acentral cavity. The presence of anovulatory folli-cles may be frustrating for reproductive specialists,given that they rarely respond to treatment (i.e.,human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]), and sponta-neously regress after 3 to 6 weeks. Secondary fol-licles may develop and ovulate despite the presenceof anovulatory follicles, but this does not alwayshappen. Therefore, mares should be monitored closely.Ovarian HematomasOccasionally, hemorrhagic anovulatory follicles un-dergo more dramatic Bleedingmay continue via diapedesis into the follicular lu-men, which expands considerably until it reaches alarge size (100 to 300 mm). This expansion oftenleads to atrophic changes in the ovarian stroma and Fig. 6. Ultrasonographic images with anovulatory 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO IN EQUINE PRACTICEthe hemorrhagic follicles become ovarian hemato-mas (Fig. 7). These luteinize andinitially appear echo-genic or hyperechoic once they start organizing (Fig.7). Occasionally, ovarian hematomas may be pain-ful, especially during rectal palpation. They resolveslowly, slower than anovulatory follicles.Ovarian TumorsOvarian tumors occur relatively often in the mare,with granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) most commonlydiagnosed (Fig. 8). Although the results of the ul-trasound evaluation of the ovary with this tumormay be suggestive, it cannot be reliably diagnosedby ultrasound examination alone. Other diagnos-tic methods must also be used. A GCT is derivedfrom hormone-producing tissue, and therefore pro-duces increased amounts of steroid hormones. De-pending on the endocrine prole, the mare mayexhibit a wide of behavioral symptoms:stallion-like behavior, nymphomania, anestrus, andincreased aggression. 16This tumor has been diag - nosed in mares of all ages and in various stages oftheir cycle, even in pregnant mares. However, itmost often occurs in middle-aged, anestrous, barrenmares. A GCT is usually benign and grows slowly,but it may reach a large size and affect the otherabdominal organs (small colon obstruction, hemo-peritoneum, etc.). Rectal palpation reveals an en-larged, smooth ovary on one side and a small,inactive ovary on the other. The affected ovary hasa fossa. The mostcharacteristic ultrasonographic appearance thismass is multicystic, but it may also be completelysolid or have only one large fluid-lled cavity (Fig.8). The walls separating the cystic structures arethicker than those between the follicles within nor-mal ovaries or between cysts. A denite diagnosis of a GCT is usually made based on the results of endocrine evaluation. Highinhibin concentrations are produced by neoplasticcells and inhibit follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),which leads to the inactivity of the contralateral ovary.Inhibin serum concentration is considered to be posi-tive for a GCT when it is /H113501 ng/mL and suspicious at levels of /H113500.7 ng/mL. 17Testosterone is often ele - vated, especially behavior is exhib-ited (/H11022 100 pg/mL), and estrogens tend to be higher than in a normal cycling mare, especially when themare exhibits nymphomania. More recently, mone additionaldiagnostic test for GCTs. 17This hormone is pro - Fig. 7.

Ultrasonographic images of ovaries from a mare that has GCT on one of her ovaries: (A) OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEduced by granulosa cells; its concentration is GCT ( /H110224.2 ng/mL). Currently, the AMH assay is the most reliablemarker of a GCT in because it has inhibin(80%), and testosterone and inhibin combined (84%). Other ovarian tumors are seen rarely in mares. Among them, the most commonly diagnosed is theovarian teratoma. This tumor is derived from plu-ripotential germ cells, 18is benign, and is nonsecre - tory. Given that it contains a mixture of variousstructures (cartilage, skin, bone, hair, nerves, seba-ceous material, teeth, etc.), its ultrasonographic ap-pearance is variable. However, it usually containsnumerous by variablyechogenic or chambers also have echogenic contents thatare often shadowing due to the presence of bonesand teeth. The serous cystadenoma of a mare's ovary can be easily misdiagnosed as a cystic ovary. It developsfrom the epithelium of the various ovarian struc-tures. 18It may produce testosterone, but a con - tralateral ovary usually functions normally and themare's behavior is unaffected. On ultrasonography,this neoplastic mass appears as a collection of multiplefluid-lled structures separated by thin walls.Periovarian and Fossa CystsEmbryonic oviduct are commonin mares. 19They may have a similar appearance and texture to ovarian follicles, and therefore maybe easily confused even when ultrasonography isused. In fact, it is easier to differentiate ovarianfollicles from periovarian cysts during manual rectalpalpation than using ultrasonography. cysts adjunct to the ovary, but are the follicles are imbedded within the ovary.Furthermore, periovarian cysts do not change theirsizes and echotexture during the estrous cycle asfollicles do, and therefore a series of ultrasono-graphic evaluations is helpful for differentiation.Periovarian cysts rarely affect a mare's fertility unless they are large. However, so-called fossacysts may impede the release of the oocyte from theovulation fossa and be detrimental to fertility.These are usually quite small (a few millimeters)and localized right at the ovulation fossa. Ultra-sonography may be helpful for visualizing them, butthey are often missed due to their small size. Uterine Abnormalities Abnormal Uterine ContentsThe presence of intraluminal fluid in the uterus inthe mare is not always abnormal. A very smallamount of fluid may be present during estrus andthe early postpartum period (Fig. 9A). However,the large accumulation of uterine fluid in a nonpreg-nant mare is always a sign of pathology and shouldbe diagnosed and treated (Fig. 9B). Uterine fluid, which appears during estrus in the mare, is usually anechoic and it disappears sponta-neously without consequences. Increased echoge-nicity is consistent with increased cellularity andmay be suggestive of an inflammatory process asso-ciated with an infection or transient inflammatoryprocess shortly after breeding. Uterine infectionsrequire treatment, whereas normal nonsusceptiblemares should recover from post-breeding endometritiswithout intervention. Some older, multiparousmares have problems with uterine clearance and theserequire specic treatment after breeding as well as theclose monitoring of their uterine contents using ultra-sonography. There should be no fluid in the uterusduring diestrus. The presence of fluid in this stage ofthe cycle is usually associated with infection. Small to moderate amounts of fluid are usually seen shortly after parturition. This fluid may beechogenic due to high cellularity. Hence, thisshould be cleared up spontaneously within a fewdays and before a foal heat. However, mares thathave limited exercise and do not have suckling foalsby their side may have problems with uterine clear-ance and require treatment. A large amount of Fig. 9. Ultrasonographic images of uterine fluid: (A) uterus with small amount of fluid; (B) uterus with large amount of fluid. 346 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: MAKING THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEechogenic, foul-smelling fluid in the uterus of a post-partum mare is usually a sign of metritis, which is alife-threatening condition and should be promptlydiagnosed and treated. Some mares accumulate a large amount of fluid in the uterus (even 60 L) for prolonged periods of timeand do not become sick. Depending on the charac-teristics of this fluid, this condition is called pyome-tra, mucometra, or urometra. Pyometra is oftenassociated with the physical or functional obstruc-tion of the cervix, which does not allow drainage.Mucometra may be a result of an imperforate hymenin llies and the backflow of uterine secretions pro-duced once puberty is reached. The ultrasono-graphic image of pyometra in the mare shows highlyechogenic uterine contents and a stretched, thinuterine wall. Occasionally, the uterus is hangingfar into the abdominal cavity, beyond the pelvicbrim, and may be inaccessible from a transrectalapproach. Therefore, transabdominal ultrasonog-raphy may be necessary for diagnosis. Once diag-nosed, pyometra should be treated by drainingthrough the cervix and/or hysterectomy. Openingthe obliterated cervix may be challenging and thisrequires the application of force and/or surgical in-struments. Partial drainage may be necessary forsuccessful ruptured torelease fluid pressure, but a thickened, persistenthymen may need to be removed using simple surgi-cal instruments. Urine is often accumulated in theuterus of mares with the cranioventral displacementof the vagina and uterus. Given that urine is echo-genic, uterine content has a similar echotexture inthe case of pyometra. Urine should be removedfrom the uterus and uterine contractions have to beinduced/hastened using oxytocin treatment. Thesurgical repair of the anatomical defect preventingthe further accumulation of urine in the uterusshould also be considered (urethral extension).Uterine CystsUterine cysts are often for equine prac-titioners pregnancy diagnosis in mares.Their ultrasonographic appearance is toand often undistinguishable from an early embry-onic vesicle 7(Fig. 10 ). They may be very small, medium-sized, or large; perfectly round, ovaloid, orirregular; single, multiple, or with multiple compart-ments; localized in one uterine horn, or disseminatedthroughout the entire uterus; luminal, transmural, orsubserosal. Their contents are anechoic and theirwalls, to an early embryonic vesicle, often gen-erate strong specular reflections. endometrial or lymphatic origin. Endometrial cysts are derived from the en-dometrial glands and are usually quite small ( /H1102110 mm in diameter). 20Lymphatic cysts come from the system but are associatedwith dilated lymphatic lacunae in uterine biopsies.These cysts occur older mares; they areusually larger than endometrial cysts and may reach30 to 50 mm in diameter. Some cysts progressivelyincrease in size, but not at a rate comparable with theembryonic vesicle. Therefore, the follow-up evalua-tion of an early pregnancy in the mare is usuallydiagnostic, given that an early embryonic vesiclechanges its size, shape, and structures in a character-istic manner, whereas cysts do not. It is good practiceto identify all uterine cysts in the mare's uterus beforeeach breeding season to avoid confusion and errorssuch as misinterpreting a cyst as a twin embryo. Cysts by themselves are rarely detrimental to fer- tility. Only large cysts can affect the mobility of anearly embryo, which is necessary to signal preg-nancy to the mare. Occasionally, the absorption ofnutrients may be affected if the cyst is adjunct to thewall of the yolk sac or allantois. Several treatments of large uterine cysts have been attempted with various degrees of success.Just rupturing or puncturing is ineffective (cystswill ll up again). Electrocoagulation or hystero-scopic (laser removal) seems to be a much moreeffective technique. 21 Uterine TumorsUterine tumors are rare in mares. They are usu-ally leiomyomas, which are slow growing and be-nign. 22These tumors are usually relatively small (5 to 15 cm in diameter), become necrotic, and causeuterine bleeding. Leiomyomas are palpable rec-tally as hard nodules or a distinct bulge of the uter-us; however, their exact size and nonuniformlyechogenic echo structure can be easily visualized byusing ultrasonography.Various Echogenic Reflectors 7 Air appears as hyperechoic spots or lines due to largedifferences in the acoustic impedance generated by airand reproductive tissues (Fig. 11A). It is often seen inthe uterine lumen shortly after breeding or othertransvaginal manipulations such as taking a uterine Fig. 10.

Bone fragments completely block the penetration of the ultrasound waves and create shadow effects.If found in the uterus, they are usually remnants ofthe macerated fetus. 20They remain in the uterus for prolonged periods of time, causing infertility, andare difcult to remove\u2014long grasping instrumentsmay be necessary. Endometrial cups that form in the uterus of a pregnant mare between the 36th and 38th days ofgestation 23,24have a limited life span of 50 to 90 days25,26and disappear between the 100th and 120th days of gestation. If a mare loses her pregnancy afterthe 35 thday of gestation, the endometrial cups are present in the uterus for the same period of time as ifthe mare was still pregnant, which affects her abilityto cycle normally and become pregnant soon. Occa-sionally, the cups are present for a prolonged period oftime (beyond the 120th day of the pregnancy). Insuch a case, they are called persistent endometrialcups. 22These are usually degenerating, calcied structures that ultrasonographic imageas bright (hyperechoic) coma-shaped structures lo-cated around the base of the formerly pregnant horn(Fig. 11B). They are difcult to terminate. Somesuccess in removing them has been reported by usinghysteroscopic laser procedures. Foreign bodies are occasionally found in the mare's uterus. The tips of uterine swabs may belost during the swabbing procedure 22(Fig. 11C). These may cause massive inflammation, which af-fects ovarian function and fertility. 27,28After local - izing a foreign body by using ultrasonography (swabhas hyperechoic appearance), it should be removedmanually, or, if this is not possible, by using hyster-oscopy and grasping instruments.4. Equine PregnancyUltrasonographic Diagnosis of Pregnancy 7 The introduction of ultrasonography to equine prac-tice revolutionized the approach to the diagnosis,monitoring, and management of equine pregnancy.The reliable detection of equine pregnancy by pal-pation \"per rectum\" is possible by approximately the28th day of gestation, when a distinct bulge is de-tectable at the base of one of the uterine horns.At that time, the nonpregnant mare has alreadypassed a deadline for her second breeding, giventhat the interovulatory period in the mare is approx-imately 21 days. Therefore, the ability to reliablydiagnose pregnancy by day 14 using ultrasonogra-phy is a great asset for the equine breeder (Fig. 12). An equine embryo descends to the uterus by days 5 to 6 after ovulation. However, it is too small to bevisualized, even when using sophisticated ultra-sound equipment. It may become visible at day 9as a small fluid-lled vesicle in any area of theuterus (horns and body) 21(Fig. 12). It is growing in size, retaining its distinct spherical shape up to days16 to 17 post-ovulation, after which the shape of theembryonic vesicle starts changing. The early em-bryonic vesicle is mobile in the uterine lumenthrough days 16 to 17 post-ovulation, 21which is necessary for pregnancy recognition and the preven-tion of early luteolysis. Smaller (younger) embryosspend more time in the body than in the horns, 29 probably due to their small size. The ultrasono-graphic image of an early spherical equine embry-onic characteristic specular ventral poles, is contained in theuniformly echogenic thick circle of the uterine wall,and has anechoic contents (yolk sac). 7The ventral uterine wall appears hyperechoic due to an echo Fig. 11. Ultrasonographic images of uterine reflectors: (A) air bubbles in the uterus; (B) persistent uterine cups; (C) tip of theuterine swab broken off in the uterus. 348 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: MAKING THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEenhancement (artifact), and two lines of shadowsare seen on both sides below the vesicle (artifacts). Most equine practitioners choose day 14 for an initial pregnancy diagnosis because it is reliable atthis time, but also because this is the optimal timefor diagnosing and managing twins. The embry-onic vesicle starts changing shape by days 16 to 18from round to triangular (\"guitar-pick shaped\") (Fig.12). The vesicle becomes less turgid and the uter-ine wall becomes thinner on the ventral side. Theventral side of the uterine wall and embryonic ves-icle remain roundish, whereas the dorsal side mayappear thicker and irregular. The embryo propercan be detected by days 20 to 21 as a small protru-sion on the ventral aspect of the vesicle, but theheart beat is not seen before days 24 to 25 (it may bevisualized earlier with ultrasound machines withsuperior resolution). Simultaneously, the allantoiccavity starts to ll up with fluid and is readily visibleat the bottom of the vesicle. The embryo is lifted up and suspended between the shrinking yolk sac andexpanding allantoic cavity. This process providesuseful yardsticks for estimating the age of the earlypregnancy in the horse. At day 27, the allantoic cav-ity takes approximately one third of the embryonicvesicle, whereas by day 30, it occupies half of the Fig. 12. Ultrasonographic images of equine pregnancy in various stages of development. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 349BACK TO BASICS: MAKING THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEvesicle already, with the embryo suspended in thecenter. The embryo is pushed up into the upper thirdpart of the vesicle by day 33 and almost all the way upat the dorsal pole by day 35. A small remnant of theyolk sac is still seen by the dorsal pole, but this disap-pears completely by day 40 when the umbilical cord isfully formed. From that time, the conceptus is nolonger called an embryo but a fetus and it starts \"sink-ing\" down toward the ventral side again. 2,30This \"migration\" to the bottom is completed by approxi-mately day 45 of gestation. Ultrasonographic Monitoring of Equine Pregnancy The fetus and fetal membranes continue to developduring gestation, and the uterus enlarges in size andshape. The main value of the ultrasound evaluationat this point is detecting fetal sex, diagnosing abnor-malities, and monitoring high-risk pregnancies.Fetal Sexing 31-33 The detection of fetal sex in the horse can be suc-cessfully done by day 55 of the pregnancy, when thegenital tubercle can be clearly visualized by usingultrasonography. 7,34The genital tubercle is the embryonic precursor of the penis in males (Fig. 13)and clitoris in females. It migrates during embry-onic development to its nal destination dependingon the fetal sex and appears on the ultrasonographicimage as a hyperechoic, bilobed structure. in equine fetuses between days 59 and68. Beyond that time, it is difcult to visualize thevesicle with the fetus in its entirety due to the lim-ited penetration of ultrasound waves when using atransrectal approach. The genital tubercle in fe-male fetuses is found under the tail heads, and inmale fetuses, just caudally to the umbilicus. Fetalsexing is more difcult after day 70; however, it canstill be done after day 90 by using the transrectalapproach, based on the detection of the scrotum inmales and the mammary gland in females. 34Thepenis also be identied in malefetuses, using transabdominal ultrasound evalua-tion between the 100th and 240th days of the preg-nancy, whereas mammary glands with teats can beidentied in female fetuses between days 90 and230 35(Fig. 14 ). Furthermore, large fetal gonads can be visualized after the 90th day of the preg-nancy. Female gonads have a central circular echo-genic structure surrounded by a hypoechogenicexternal hallow, whereas male gonads have a homo-geneous echotexture and thin echogenic centrallongitudinal line (Fig. 15). Color Doppler ultra-sonography allows us to visualize the characteristicvascularization of the fetal gonads: cortical vesselsin the periphery of the fetal ovary and the centralvein that runs through the fetal testis. 35,36 Early that approximately 5% to 15% of equine preg-nancies are lost between the 10th and 50th days ofgestation, 37the early identication of embryonic de - mise is important to enter the mare back into thebreeding program before the breeding season ends.It is difcult to visualize the signs of early embryonicdeath (EED) between the 10th and 20th days ofgestation given that the embryo proper is not yetvisible on the ultrasonographic image. However,any signicant changes in the spherical shape of anearly embryonic vesicle (under the 16th day of preg-nancy), abnormal echogenicity of fluid, or smallersize of the embryonic vesicle than expected, may be Fig. 13. Ultrasonographic image of the genital tubercle in thefetus at 65th day of gestation. Fig. 14. Ultrasonographic image of the mammary gland in fe-male fetus at 93rd day of gestation. 350 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: MAKING THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEwarning signs of an impending embryonic death(Fig. 16). 37,38It has been suggested that equine embryos that are small for their day of gestationmay not be able to block luteolysis and maintain CLfunction. 37Degenerating embryos may be found in the body of the uterus beyond day 16 due to thefailure of xation. However, given that the normalembryonic vesicle in the horse looks misshapen atday 17, a particular caution must be taken wheninterpreting ultrasonographic images of equinepregnancies at this stage. The lack of a heartbeatin the embryo proper seems to be the best indicatorof embryonic death. A decrease in the embryonicheart rate can often be seen just before death.In addition, the disorganization of embryonic mem-branes, slow or lack of growth of the vesicle, lowvolume of embryonic fluid, and increased echogenic-ity of embryonic fluids can be observed. Mares maystart coming to heat early and build up uterineedema and fluid. There are various causes of early embryonic loss in the mare. Reduced progesterone concentrationsin the mare are not compatible with the mainte-nance of pregnancy and these lead to embryonic loss.This may be due to the failure to recognize thepregnancy, primary luteal insufciency, or endome-trial irritation causing luteolysis Endometritis a hostile uterineenvironment and induces luteolysis. Even a briefepisode of endotoxemia may stimulate prostaglan-din release, which causes the lysis of the CL. Agedmares have a signicantly higher occurrence of EEDthan young mares. Various factors contribute tothis such as aged gametes leading to chromosomal Fig. 15. Ultrasonographic images of fetal gonads: (A) fetal ovaries; (B) fetal testes. Fig. 16.

Someincidental embryonic causes factors, are also identied. The morpho-logical defects of chromosomal aberration may occurspontaneously without maternal involvement.TwinsUltrasound imaging is crucial for detecting andmanaging twin pregnancies in the mare. 39It has been reported that the incidence of double ovula-tions in Thoroughbred and draft mares is as high as15% to 25%, but in Quarter Horses, Appaloosa, andponies, double ovulations occur in 8% to 11%. 40 Diagnosis is relatively easy between the 13th and15th days of gestation; however, only if the examinerpays attention to the details, screens the entire re-productive tract several times, and documents theuterine cysts well. Embryonic vesicles migratethrough the uterine lumen until the 16th to 17thdays of the pregnancy, after which they are xed atthe base of the uterine horn. Twin vesicles aremost often xed in the same horn (unilateral, 70%)but one of them is usually naturally reduced by day40 (85% of cases), while the remaining embryo sur-vives. 41-43The majority of twins that do not un - dergo natural reduction by day 40 survive as twinsuntil late pregnancy. Late-term twins are usuallyaborted, often causing severe dystocia. All bilat-eral twins (localized in separate horns) survive untillate pregnancy and have a similar outcome to thatdescribed for surviving unilateral twins (fetal deathand abortion). Both fetuses survive to term onlyrarely and live foals are usually smaller, weaker,and do not perform in their adult life as other horsesin their age classications. This effect is associatedwith the mare's placentation and the necessity touse the entire uterine surface to properly nourishone fetus. In the case of twins, two fetuses wouldshare the mare's uterus, which leads to the insuf-cient exchange of nutrients and waste between fetaland maternal circulations. The early detection and management of twins is a routine task for the equine reproductive specialist.Although research has shown the high incidence ofthe natural reduction of unilateral twins, it is highlyrecommended to perform the early reduction of alltwins regardless of their location. The best time formanual embryo reduction is during the mobilephase (up to days 16 to 17). The operator can ma-nipulate the uterus and manually separate the em-bryos, even if they are unilateral, move the targetedembryo to the most desirable location (very tip of theuterine horn), and crush it by using the palm ofthe hand, ngers (a thumb and an index nger), orthe ultrasound probe. This procedure yields a veryhigh success rate if performed before day 20 (90% to95% survival rate of one embryo). 44-46The reduc - tion of unilateral twins beyond day 17 may be dif-cult and frustrating, given that embryos are nolonger mobile and the success rate of this proceduresignicantly decreases. Bilateral twins can still becrushed at day 20, but it should not be attempted afterday 25. Since the aggressive manipulation of theuterus during manual embryo crush may cause pros-taglandin release, the administration of anti-prosta-glandin medication (flunixine meglumine) followed byprogestagens (Altrenogest) is highly recommended. If a twin pregnancy is not detected and reduced on time (by days 20 to 25), other methods are available.Dietary restrictions have not proven to be effective.Blind aspiration of fetal fluids via transvaginal as-piration or surgical removal of the twin is traumaticand should not be used. The transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration of the allantoic fluid has a successrate that is lower than manual crush; however, itmay be attempted in valuable horses, especially ifthis is the last chance for this mare to have a foalthis season. This method has a variable successrate depending on the gestation age, localization ofthe vesicles, and experience of the operators. Thebest results are obtained if performed between days25 and 35 of gestation, particularly in the case ofunilateral twins. 46In general, the procedure yields a successful outcome in approximately 50% of cases(20% to 70%), with unilateral twin pregnancy hav-ing a signicantly lower success rate than bilateraltwins. 45Specialized equipment is needed for this procedure with a long extension of the ultrasoundprobe and a long needle. The embryonic vesicle ispunctured under the direct guidance of the ultra-sonographic image, with the puncture guide dis-played on the screen, while the uterus is held closeto the vaginal wall by the hand of the operatorintroduced into the mare's rectum. The ultrasoundtransducer is inserted into the mare's vagina in anaseptic way and is held next to the wall of thecranial vagina. A needle is inserted by using asingle strong thrust through the vaginal wall, peri-toneum, and uterine wall, directly into the allantoiccavity or the yolk sac, and the fluid is completelydrained. Additional damage to the embryo/fetuscan also occur by direct punctures. An ultrasound probe and the ultrasonographer's hand can be utilized in an attempt to irreversiblydamage equine twin fetus between days 60 and 100of gestation. A smaller fetus is identied and re-peatedly traumatized by oscillation or percussionwith the ultrasound probe, which may be combinedwith a membrane slip. Multiple attempts oftenhave to be performed to obtain a desired effect.Approximately 50% of targeted fetuses become un-viable after this procedure. 47 Craniocervical dislocation can be performed on the fetus between days 60 and 110 of gestation.48,49 It is important to perform this procedure before theplacentation process is completed so that the re-maining fetus can still \"claim\" the entire uterinesurface for its placental exchange. Initially, thisprocedure was performed by using both the trans-rectal and the transabdominal (surgical) ap- 352 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO BASICS: MAKING THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEproaches. Currently, veterinarians that perform this procedure choose thesurgical method, given that ityields signicantly better results (70% to 80% success rate). Aflank incision ismade, the uterus is identied by using one arm introduced intothe abdominal cavity, and craniocervical dislocationis performed manually on one fetus without incisingtheuterine wall. The affected fetus may live fora be performed in mares between days 66 and168 of gestation. However, this procedure is usually performed between days 115 and 130 ofgestation 50 this is lined up with the fetal heart and the spinal needle isintroduced into the fetal heart with just one or a fewfast thrusts. Needle insertion canalso besuccess- fully performed without abiopsy onthescreen (Fig. 17). Potassium chloride or penicillin procaine isinjected into the heart, 50,51causing fetal death during the procedure or soon after. This procedure has to be performed by an experienced, skilled opera-torand inavery clean, aseptic manner. Treatment with anti-inflammatory/anti-prostaglandin medica- tions progestagens is initiated, as for otherabove-described procedures.Late Pregnant Mare Ultrasonography isused routinely formonitoring high-risk late pregnancies inmares. During this period oftime, aveterinarian focuses attention primarily onplacental abnormalities and fetal ultrasound examination ofthelate pregnant mare. Transrectal ultrasound examination can visualize most of the caudal part of the uterus and fetal mem-branes, called theutero-placental unit. The orseparation ofthechorio-allantois from theuterine wall. combined thickness of the uterus and placenta (CTUP) ismeasured by using ultrasound calipers and compared with estab-lished normal reference values (271 to300 days of gestation /H110218 mm; 301 to 330 days of gestation /H1102110 mm; beyond 330th day ofgestation /H1102112mm). 53 This measure side oftheplacental sac, just between thewall ofthe urinary bladder and a uterine vessel (uterine branchofthevaginal vein), running parallel totheurinary bladder wall (Fig. 18). The increased thickness of Fig. 17. Ultrasonographic image ofultrasound guided injection ofpenicillin procaine into thefetal heart. Fig. 18. chorio-allantois fromthe endometrium are usually associated with as-cending placentitis, which needs to be immediatelyaddressed by aggressive treatment to save the preg-nancy. 53-55Allantoic fluid is usually clear during the ultrasound evaluation of a normal pregnancy;however, it may have an increased number of \"free-floating particles\" later on in pregnancy, especiallyafter fetal or the mare's transportation.These particles appear hyperechoic. Amniotic fluidcan be slightly more cellular than allantoic and cre-ate a slight echo on the ultrasonographic image;however, a signicant increase in cloudiness (in-creased echogenicity) and/or thickening of the amni-otic membranes are usually associated with thepathological process, often of an infectious nature.Only part of the fetus can be visualized by using thetransrectal ultrasonographic approach in the latepregnant mare. The equine fetus usually has ananterior presentation, and therefore the fetal skullis often visualized. Given that the size of the fetalorbit correlates with fetal age, the measurement ofthe fetal orbit may be obtained to estimate the fetalage in the mare. 56,57Fetal movements can also be detected during rectal palpation. A more detailed examination of the equine fetus can be performed by using transabdominal ultra-sound examination. The measurements of CTUP can be taken, assessments of the echogenicity ofthe fetal fluids done, and fetal organs visualized.The ribcage creates multiple artifacts in the formof black lines, which are the effect of a completeblockage of the ultrasound waves by the ribs. 7 These shadowing effects obscure the visualizationof the fetal internal organs. However, the heartcan be clearly visualized in the chest cavity and itsmovement can be seen. The heart rate is objec-tively measured by using M-mode (Fig. 19). Thefetal heart rate in the horse steadily decreasesduring pregnancy, starting from 150 to 190 beatsper minute (bpm) and decreasing to 60 to 80 bpm(average 75 /H110067 bpm; 58) in late pregnancy. How - ever, it varies considerably depending on the fetaland mare's activity and should temporarily accel-erate after fetal movement. A consistently slowor very high fetal heart rate is a sign of fetaldistress. 58-60If diagnosis is not made early enough and/or treatment is ineffective, the fetusdies and does not have any spontaneous move-ment and there is no heart beat (diagnostic if theheart is clearly visualized, but no movementand/or Doppler signal seen). Summarizing, ultrasonography is routinely used for the examination of the reproductive tractin mares. This technique allows the close moni-toring of physiological changes during the estrouscycle and diagnosing various pathologies. Fur-thermore, ultrasonography is necessary to diag-nose early pregnancy in the mare and is used forthe diagnosis of twins. This technique also al-lows the close monitoring of late pregnancies andis useful when performing ultrasound-guided re-productive procedures.

Lester, BVMS, PhD, DACVIM (LAIM) Author's address: G.Lester@murdoch.edu.au. \u00a9 2017 AAEP. 1. Introduction Abdominal ultrasound in adult horses is limited bybody size. In addition, attenuation of the ultra-sound beam and resultant poor image quality iscommon when the body wall is thick and/or the skinis poorly prepared. Fat in the abdominal wall notonly displaces the tissue of interest further from thetransducer but fat signicantly attenuates the ultra- sound beam. In most circumstances clipping shouldnot be required in order to achieve a diagnostic scan but aids in performing scans on obese animals.Isopropyl alcohol is typically applied to skin to im-prove contact. Ultrasound coupling gel can also beused to further improve contact if necessary. Ide-ally the scanning depth should be a minimum of 24 cm in adult horses, although 30 cm or greater ispreferred. The ideal probe is a low-frequencycurved array (curvilinear) probe although a small-footprint phased array probe is also effective.Valuable information can be achieved using 5 to7.5 MHz linear rectal transducer, although for acomplete examination, a lower-frequency probe isrequired. Normally a small volume of anechoic peritoneal fluid can be located in most normal horses, typicallyventrally or around the duodenum. Failure toidentify peritoneal fluid can be normal as the fluid isoften transiently located. Furthermore, failure toimage fluid should not preclude abdominocentesis ifdeemed important to the diagnostic evaluation. 1,2 Peritoneal fluid should be assessed for volume, echo-genicity, brin, and gas. Blood has a characteristicechogenic swirling pattern on ultrasound. Thepresence of hyperechoic fluid with brin attached tothe peritoneum is common after rupture of an ab-dominal viscus (Fig. 1). The liver is most easily imaged on the right side of the abdomen. It can usually be located between the5th and 16th intercostal spaces (ICSs) from the rightcranioventral abdomen through the mid to upperabdomen caudally. Adjacent structures include theright colon and the duodenum (Fig. 2). The livershould not be found ventral to the costochondraljunction and if found in that location may inferhepatic enlargement. There is evidence of right he-patic lobe atrophy associated with aging in normalhorses, 3such that the number of ICSs where liver is identied on the right side is reduced in horses olderthan 24 years. 4In a study of normal horses, the liver was observed on the right side in 97% of horsesand on the left in 71% of animals. 4Consequently, failure to identify liver on the left side does not inferdisease. On the left side the liver can be imagedfrom the 4th to the 11th ICSs. The liver should behomogenous and diffusely hypoechoic relative to thespleen, and hyperechoic relative the renal cortex.The portal vein and caudal vena cava may be seenon the right side walls, AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 357BACK TO BASICS: THE MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICE NOTESwhereas hepatic veins do not. Biliary ducts canalso be identied throughout the liver in normalhorses. The spleen is easily located between the 7th ICS and paralumbar fossa on the left side. The organinterfaces dorsocaudally with the left kidney andcranially with the stomach and liver. It is not un-common for the spleen to cross the ventral midlineand extend over to the right side of the abdomen insome normal horses and this does not imply spleno-megaly. The caudal border of the spleen should besharp. Splenic disease can include megaly, neopla-sia, abscess, or haematoma (Fig. 3). The spleen ishyperechoic relative to the liver; the organs can beseen in apposition in the left cranial section of theabdomen (Fig. 4). The left kidney lies deep to the spleen and can be difcult to image in some normal horses, particu-larly obese animals. Direct apposition of the spleenand kidney is important in ruling out a nephro-splenic entrapment (Fig. 5). In Thoroughbred-typehorses the left kidney is approximately 16 /H1100311 cm and is typically located from the paralumbar fossathrough to the 15th ICS, 2 cm dorsal to 15 cm ven-tral to the dorsal aspect of the tuber coxae. 5The right kidney is slightly smaller measuring 15 /H1100310 cm. It is located beneath the transverse processesfrom the 16th to the 14th ICS, again from 2 cmdorsal to the dorsal margin of the tuber coxae to apoint approximately 12 cm ventral. 5 The stomach is adjacent to the spleen on the left side of the abdomen. In normal horses it is typi-cally found over 2 to 4 ICSs, although this mayincrease to 5 in normal ponies. 1The probe should be centered on the 10th ICS in the middle third ofthe abdomen (in a dorsal to ventral plane) andmoved 2 to 3 spaces cranially and caudally. Detec-tion over more than 5 ICSs is consistent with gastricdistention in adult horses. Enlargement of thestomach is most commonly due to fluid, but can alsobe associated with ingesta, gas, or neoplasia (Fig. 6).Distention with fluid is easily seen as a large fluidgas interface. The gastric wall should be less than7 mm thick. Fig. 1. Septic peritonitis after gastric rupture. Fig. 2. A right-sided image with liver and duodenum. Fig. 3. Left-sided image of a spleen with discrete multifocallesions due to melanoma. Fig. 4.

The duodenal wall is 3mm (3.0 /H110060.4 mm) thick in normal adult horses. 8 Wall thickness may be thinner in ponies, particu-larly younger animals. 1Intestinal wall thickness is influenced by the degree of distention (thinning)and relative stage of contraction (thickening) socare is required in performing and interpretingmeasurements. The jejunum is commonly located in the left cau- dal abdomen, ventral and medial to the spleen, oftenaround the costochondral junction. It is easilyidentied by its size, shape, and characteristicmovement. Variation in position within the abdo-men is common and it can be found in multipleregions, although it is uncommon to identify smallintestine in the right caudodorsal abdomen. 9Accu - mulation of distended motile small intestine in thecranioventral abdomen can be consistent with gas-trosplenic or epiploic foramen strangulating events(Fig. 7). The large intestine is recognized by the acoustic shadowing of contents and its large diameter. Thepresence or absence of sacculations should be noted.The wall thickness of the cecum (4.2 /H110060.3 mm) and ventral colon (3.7 /H110060.1 mm) is greater than the small intestine. 8Cecal wall measurements are subject to variability between and within studies.The left and right ventral colon are consistentlylocated in their respective caudoventral and ventralregions. They also feature prominent haustra-tions. Although the dorsal colon is typically consid-ered to be lacking these structures there are somesacculations at the diaphragmatic flexure and in theright dorsal colon, but these are wider and lessprominent than in the ventral colon. 9 There are a number of conditions that affect the ultrasonographic appearance of the large colon.These include fluid accumulation, tympany, wallthickening due to inflammation or strangulation,and displacement (Fig. 8). Animals with strangu-lating obstruction of the large colon will have athickened wall. Horses with colitis are often easyto scan because fluid accumulation within the colonfacilitates penetration of the ultrasound beam be-yond the mucosa into the lumen. The fluid alsoacts as a nice contrast agent to better assess thecolonic wall. The lower right abdomen should beexamined over several ICSs (10th to 14th ICS) at thecostochondral junctions for evidence of a right dorsaldisplacement of the large colon (RDDLC). This isreflected by identifying the colonic vasculatureagainst the body wall, instead of in its normal me- Fig. 5. A left-sided image with the spleen in direct apposition tothe kidney. Fig. 6.

Although abdominal radiography isthe preferred method for detecting sand the accumu-lation of geosediment in the colon can also beachieved with ultrasound, by identication of hyper-echoic colon against the body wall with extensivereflection of the ultrasound beam causing variableshadowing. 10 The concept of performing a rapid ultrasound examination of the abdomen in colicky animalsresulted in development of the Fast Localized Ab-dominal Sonography of Horses (FLASH) examina-tion protocol. 7The concept is loosely based on the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Traumaprotocol in humans, where 5 views are rapidly ob-tained from humans in the emergency room (ER)and assessed for fluid in spaces and movement of thelung edges in the pleural cavity. The originalFLASH protocol evaluated 7 sites, 4 from the left:ventral abdomen, stomach, renosplenic window, andthe left middle third of the abdomen; and 3 from theright: duodenal window, right middle third of theabdomen, and the cranioventral thorax. The au-thors reported a scan time approximately 10 min-utes and good positive (89%) and negative (81%)predictive values for detecting disease. A recentre-examination of the protocol indicated that it was likely to identify small intestinal lesions and mostlarge intestinal problems, although the horseswith RDDLC might be missed as the vessels areoften located lower in the right abdomen aroundthe costochondral junctions. 11 Thoracic Ultrasound The thorax should be scanned in a methodical man-ner given that pulmonary lesions can often be focal.Most equine vets scan in a cranial direction begin-ning at the 17th ICS and moving through to the 3rdICS. The probe is orientated within each ICS par-allel to the ribs and moved in a dorsal to ventraldirection until the diaphragm is reached. The dia-phragm inserts on the thoracic wall, and from the8th costal cartilage it curves across the costochon-dral junctions of the 9th to the 15th ribs to a pointmidway on the last rib before moving craniomediallyto end at the 17th ICS. 12The probe can be oscil - lated forward and backward to assess lung and pleu-ral tissue underlying the ribs. The most cranialaspect of lung and the mediastinum can be imagedthrough the triceps brachii and deltoideus musclesof the shoulder. Alternatively a window under thetriceps brachii muscle can give access to this regionassuming the leg can be brought forward and theprobe orientated toward the cranial mediastinum.For most of the examination a linear or curvilinearprobe can be used at a high frequency and reduceddepth. A rectal transducer can adequately scan themajority of the lung elds. The visceral pleura of the normal lung slides evenly over the parietal pleural surface in syn-chrony with respiration. It has a consistent brightinterface indicative of a reflective surface. Associ-ated with this normal interface are horizontal, reg-ularly spaced hyperechoic lines deep to the pleuralline that represent reverberation artifact. Theseare called A lines and are motionless. There isoften minimal to no pleural fluid imaged, although asmall volume (/H110213 cm) of anechoic fluid can be found ventrally in normal horses. It is common to ob-serve fat in the ventral thorax in normal horses,which will cause the lung to be displaced medially. \"Comet tails\" or \"ring-down\" artifacts are hyper- echoic reflections that originate from the visceralpleural and travel perpendicular to the pleural lineinto the lung. In the perfectly normal lung thereare no \"comet tails\" because there are no acousticmismatches as the ultrasound beam passes throughthe sub-pleural space. In circumstances where ab-normal regions in the lung are in contact with thepleural lining there are acoustic mismatches, whichcause the artifacts to form (Fig. 9). The reflectionsare transmitted back to the probe where they arefalsely interpreted as hyperechoic structures deeperin the tissue. There are numerous causes of \"comettails\" including diseases of the pleural surface and avariety of lung parenchymal conditions. Artifactshadowing can also occur if the beam is not perpen-dicular to the pleural line, as commonly occurs in thevery dorsal aspects of the lung elds. It is not uncommon to nd a few narrow-based \"comet tails\" in clinically healthy horses, especiallyventrally in aged animals. Broad-based \"comettails\" or numerous narrow-based artifacts are prob-ably more signicant, but ultimately importanceshould be based on history and clinical ndings. Lung consolidation can lead to pulmonary hepati- zation, where the ultrasound beam can penetratethe lung because the tissue is devoid of air, giving itan appearance similar to liver (Fig. 10). This canoccur with pneumonia or compression atelectasis(see below). Pulmonary abscesses can be seen if indirect content with the pleural surface. They typi- Fig. 8.

Echodensity varies depend-ing on contents. Rhodococcus equ i abscesses com- monly occur at the periphery and are thereforeeasily detected with ultrasound (Fig. 11). Scanningof at-risk foals is an excellent method of detectingdisease before clinical presentation, although thediagnosis cannot be denitively conrmed with ul-trasound. 13The number and size of abscesses may be important in determining whether treatment isrequired.Accumulation of pleural fluid is the most common pleural abnormality. Fluid can vary from anechoicthrough to hyperechoic. Blood in the pleural cavitywill appear as a highly cellular, variably echogenicmaterial with swirling pattern. Neo- plasia (hemangiosarcoma) suspectedwith hemothorax in adult horses, and rib fracturein foals. It is common to scan ribs in foals afterdystocia; costochondral dislocation is common,whereas rib shaft fractures are rare but are oftensymptomatic. If the volume of fluid is moderate there will be compression atelectasis of healthy lung, lung dis-placement, and the ventral lung will appear floatingin the accumulated fluid (Fig. 10). The effusion willalso make 2 normal structures more obvious: thepericardial-diaphragmatic ligament and the tissuethat divides the heart.Infectious pleural effusion is typically echogenic al-though this may be layered with a greater cell con-tent ventrally. Fibrin can form and attach to thevisceral and parietal pleural surfaces. With timethe brin will become more organized adhering thelung to the thoracic wall and potentially isolatingareas leading to focal pleural abscesses. Free gasbubbles in the fluid are often associated with anaer-obic bacterial infections. Pneumothorax is detected by scanning from the most dorsal aspect of the thorax and moving ven-trally, carefully looking for a break in the reverber-ation air artifact. The aerated lung will move withventilation whereas the air in the pleural space willbe static. The lung interface will appear brighterthan normal due to atelectasis. Vascular Ultrasound The jugular vein is the most common vascular struc-ture that is imaged in clinical practice. This vein Fig. 9. Lung narrow and broad-based \"comet tails.\" Fig. 10. Pleuropneumonia case illustrating collapsed triangularlung pleural fluid, and brin. Fig. 11. A nodular lesion in lung OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICEcommonly develops thrombophlebitis associatedwith catheterization, particularly in horses that aresystemically unwell (Fig. 12). The vein can be im-aged from the thoracic inlet proximally to the bifur-cation into internal and external jugular branchescaudal to the vertical ramus of the mandible. Thevein is easily collapsed under pressure of the probeso imaging is enhanced with the vein distended.Images should be obtained in transverse and longi-tudinal planes. A high-frequency (10 to 15 MHz)linear transducer is preferred but a linear rectaltransducer can provide diagnostic images. Thenormal vein has a thin and echogenic wall and thecontents will be visible with varying echo densitydue to restriction of flow. In longitudinal imagessmall venous valves can be seen extending from thewall in normal horses. The carotid artery lies be-neath the jugular vein. Flow in both vessels is bestassessed with Doppler imaging. Early changes associated with phlebitis include thickening of the vessel wall, including both thetunica media (middle layer) and the tunica intima(inner layer). Intraluminal thrombi tend to form atthe point of vessel damage (catheter entry) and canprogress in both directions. Older clots tend to bewell organized with smooth margins; active prolifer-ating thrombi on the edges tend to have a moreirregular surface. Flow is initially restricted butongoing proliferation may lead to complete occlusionof the vein. In a transverse view, mature thrombiwill have a characteristic laminar pattern. Differ-entiation of septic from nonseptic thrombophlebitisis important and is supported by clinical and labo-ratory ndings, local heat and pain on palpation andfever, and leukocytosis with a mature neutrophilia,hyperbrinogenemia, and increased serum amyloidA. On ultrasound, sepsis is a pro-nounced perivascular swelling, echogenic foci withinthe thrombus, and fluid accumulation within theclot.Ocular Ultrasound Scanning of the eye and orbit is performed in thestanding, sedated horse. It is particularly impor-tant to perform in horses with ocular trauma or withevidence of intraocular masses. The examinationis facilitated by an auriculopalpebral block and ap-plication of a topical aesthetic agent to the cornea.The examination is usually performed through theclosed eyelid, although better images are achievedwith the probe directly on the cornea if it is free ofdisease. 14Standard ultrasound contact gel should not be placed directly on the globe. A safer alter-native is a sterile gel, such as KY jelly. Ideally ahigh-frequency ( /H1102210 MHz) linear transducer is used. and posterior lens cap-sules, retina/sclera, and ciliary body structures globe.The corpora nigra is located at the pupillary marginwithin the anterior chamber; these are subject tocyst formation with a characteristic anechoic center.Intraocular neoplasia is more commonly homoge-nous. The anterior chamber is hypoechoic andtherefore the accumulation of brin, blood (hy-phema) or white blood cells (hypopyon) increases theechodensity of the aqueous humor. Cellular re-sponses (hyphema, hypopyon) tend to settle ven-trally within the chamber. The body of the lens isnormally anechoic; cataract formation will result inincreased opacity and the lens may vary in size.The lens capsule may also appear brighter. Ultrasound permits some assessment of the pos- terior segment if there is anterior chamber diseaseor cataracts preventing ophthalmoscopic examina-tion of the fundus. Retinal detachment is seen as athin hyperechoic structure prolapsing into the vitre-ous. The retina often maintains attachment at theoptic nerve and ora ciliaris retinae, producing a\"seagull\" sign. 14Smaller degrees of detachment will not have this appearance.

Introduction Although ultrasound technology has improved sub-stantially during the past 2 decades, with an asso-ciated reduction in cost, scanning and interpretationof the heart in all aged animals remains a majorchallenge for even experienced practitioners. Theneed for echocardiography is typically due to persis-tent or atypical cardiac murmurs. This examina-tion requires good equipment, experience, andexpertise for accurate interpretation. Much of theage-related changes in heart size was published byStewart and others in 1984 1, who reported M-mode parameters from birth through 3 months of age.They reported a number parameters that were pos-itively correlated with age and body weight, includ-ing both left ventricular (LV) and right ventricularend-diastolic diameters (EDDs), the thickness of theinterventricular septum, and the thickness of LVfree (posterior) wall. LV to 7.76 and 6.92 cm, respectively,during the rst 3 months of life. For comparison,the LV EDD and LV ESD in a typical adult Thor-oughbred is 12 and 7.5 cm, respectively. Foals by their relatively small size and limited adipose tissue are usually amenable to comprehen- sive abdominal ultrasound examinations. Examplesof diseases detected on abdominal ultrasound in-clude uroperitoneum, necrotizing enterocolitiswith gas shadows seen in peritonitis, and intussusceptions. Inolder foals to Lawsonia can be easily imaged(Fig. 2). 2. Umbilical Scanning in Neonates Scanning of the umbilicus is recommended in allsick foals, particularly those with localized or sys-temic evidence of sepsis. Ideally the hair on theventral midline of the abdomen is clipped from thexiphoid to the inguinal area, but application of iso-propyl alcohol is often adequate without clipping.The scan can be performed with the foal standing orin lateral recumbency. Dorsal recumbency affordsthe best access but care should be taken as thispositioning has an adverse effect on ventilation.The preferred probe is a high-frequency (10 to 14MHz) linear transducer, although diagnostic scanscan be performed with a 5-to-7.5-MHz linear rectalprobe. Structures are imaged in both longitudinal and transverse planes. It is helpful to adhere to a rou-tine so as not to miss any structures. The externalumbilical remnant contains the two umbilical arter- 364 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBACK TO MOST OF ULTRASOUND IN EQUINE PRACTICE NOTESies, the umbilical vein and the urachus. In thenormal foal the structures will rapidly atrophy afterthe cord has naturally severed; sharp transection ofthe cord will delay this normal response. Infectionof this structure is usually easily identied throughpalpation and ultrasound. The stump may bethickened with a core with variable echogenicity.Gas may be present and is seen as bright hyper-echoic flecks. The umbilical vein lies cranial to the umbilicus and is very supercial running in a reflection of theperitoneum (Fig. 3). As you approach the xiphoidcartilage the vein will move deeper and enter theliver. The vein has a flattened, elliptical shapewith a thin wall and hypoechoic center. The diam-eter should not exceed 10 mm and does narrow as itmoves cranially. In contrast the paired umbilicalarteries run caudally from the umbilicus. The ar-teries separate and move deeper into the abdomenwhere they run on the lateral walls of the bladder,ultimately becoming the round ligaments of thebladder. The arteries in isolation should be lessthan 10 mm diameter. Asymmetry of arteries iscommon and is normal. The urachus, the anatomical connection between the bladder and the allantois, is located between thearteries. A combined measurement of the arteriesand urachus just caudal to the umbilicus is madefrom a transverse view and should be less than 25mm (Fig. 4). Reopening of the urachus is commonafter birth in sick foals, possibly associated withmuscular weakness. Ultrasound examination istypically normal, i.e., thin walled with a hypoechoiccenter, although in some cases patency may be as-sociated with infection. Infection will often causethe combined measurement of arteries and urachusto increase. Disruption of the urinary tract most commonly involves a tear of the urinary bladder, but in somecases the tear may be in the urachus. If the Fig. 4. Paired umbilical arteries and urachus. Fig. 1.

It is important to note that infection of the umbil- ical remnants can be obvious externally (Fig. 5), butoften is only apparent on ultrasound examinationwhen internalized (Fig. 6).Acknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veter-inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

To investigate the source of infec-tion, we examined the nasal MRSA colonization inhealthy Thoroughbred racehorses, veterinarians, andofce staff at the racehorse hospitals of the two train-ing centers. 2. Materials and Methods We took the nasal swabs from 600 healthyThoroughbred racehorses, 53 veterinarians, and 16ofce staff. SCC mec, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and electrophoresis performed for genetic characterizations of MRSA strains. Nine MRSA isolates from infected horses hospitalized at these hospitals were used forcomparisons of genetic characterizations.3. Results MRSA was not isolated from the healthy racehorsesand ofce staff, but was isolated from 16 veterinar-ians (30.1%). Ten of 16 strains were classied asSCCmec type II-ST5 and 6 of 16 were classied as SCCmec type IV-ST8. All nine strains isolated from the infected horses were classied as SCCmectype II-ST5. PFGE typing indicated that 19 strainsof the SCC mec type II-ST5 strains isolated from veterinarians and infected horses were geneticallyidentical or highly similar. 4. Discussion These results indicated the occupational risk ofMRSA colonization in veterinarians. Moreover,PFGE typing suggested that SCC mec type II-ST5 strains were transmitted between veterinariansand infected horses. Hygiene management maybe required to prevent MRSA infections in horsesand colonization in veterinarians.

Our objective was to evaluate two grain-feeding reg-imens: traditional grain feeding (twice a day; TF)compared with horses fed with an automated feederprogrammed to deliver grain in 20 equal aliquots(FF) throughout the day and its effects on gastriculceration, body weight, and body condition score(BCS). 2. Materials and Methods Thirty-one Quarter Horses were maintained in in-dividual stalls during the experimental period andworked at moderate exercise intensity. Sixteenhorses were fed via FF having its total daily grainamount aliquoted and released every hour for 20consecutive hours. Fifteen horses were fed via TFtwo times a day. Both groups received 60% of drymatter intake (DMI) as forage split into two feed-ings. Gastroscopies were performed before grain adaptation (0), 30, and 60 days. Weight and BCSwere evaluated biweekly with feed intake mea-sured daily. 3. Results There were no changes in gastric ulcer scores in FFhorses and higher gastric ulcer scores in TF horsesover time. No signicant differences were foundwhen comparing the two groups for BCS, bodyweight, and feed intake/wastage throughout thetime period. 4.

NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury is a frequent ad-verse event associated with NSAID use and evidenceexists that NSAIDs induce GI microbial imbalance(dysbiosis) in other animals and people. Cyclooxy-genase (COX)-2-selective NSAIDs are thought to re-sult in less GI damage. It is unknown, however,whether NSAIDs alter the fecal microbiota of horses.Therefore, our objectives were to determine whetherthe composition and diversity of the fecal microbiotaof adult horses were altered by NSAID use andwhether these effects differed between COX-2-selective NSAIDs and nonCOX-selective NSAIDs. 2. Materials and Methods Twenty-ve adult horses were randomly assignedto one of three groups: control (n /H110055), phenylbu- tazone (n /H1100510), or rocoxib (n /H1100510). Treatments were administered for 10 days. Fecal samples werecollected on days 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. DNA wasextracted from feces and the 16S rRNA gene ampli-ed and sequenced to determine the compositionand diversity of the microbiota. 3. Results and Discussion Although the fecal microbiota prole of the controlgroup remained stable over time, the phenylbutazoneand rocoxib groups had decreased diversity and al-teration of their microbiota proles that were mostpronounced at day 10. Dysbiosis has been linked toseveral important diseases of horses including colic,laminitis, and infections from enteric pathogens andthese ndings suggest that commonly administeredNSAIDs result in dysbiosis of horses.

Introduction There is growing pressure in the United States toeliminate race-day furosemide administrationdespite its efcacy in exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH). No effec-tive alternative therapies have been identied.We investigated some alternatives that might atten-uate EIPH. 2. Methods Six horses underwent treadmill exercise to fatigue24 hours after the initiation of seven treatment pro-tocols: 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg furosemide IV with andwithout controlled access to water; 24-hour access to water; 4 hours after 0.5 furosemide IV, and a placebo. Bronchoalveolar la-vage (BAL) erythrocyte was determined beforeand 45-60 minutes post-exercise. The latter fol-lowed an endoscopic examination for assignment of an EIPH score. Body weight, urinary volumes and ion excretions, plasma and intraerythrocytic ionconcentrations, and fecal water and water intakewere monitored from beginning treatment until just before exercise. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, and the most promising treat-ment further evaluated using endoscopy and BALfollowing simulated races. 3. Results Furosemide, 0.5 mg/kg, combined with controlledaccess to water signicantly reduced the severity ofEIPH. No ill effects were no detected in the horses. 4.

Discussion These ndings suggest that COX-2-selective NSAIDsresult in less ulceration of the glandular mucosathan non-COX selective NSAIDs. Fecal albuminwas associated with glandular ulcer scores and didnot differ between treatment groups.

Unfortunately, there is limited informationregarding the impact that feeding may have on oralbioavailability of this drug in adult horses. 2. Materials and Methods Six healthy adult horses were administered intrave-nous (2.2 mg/kg) and oral minocycline (4 mg/kg) withaccess to hay provided at the time of oral drug admin-istration (fed group) and with access to hay delayed for2 hours after oral drug administration (fasted group)using a Latin Square crossover design and a 7-daywashout period between treatments. Plasma concen-tration versus time data was analyzed based on non-compartmental pharmacokinetics. 3. Results When comparing fasted to fed horses, mean /H11006SD bioavailability (fasted, 38.6% /H110064.6; 0.281 /H110060.157 /H9262g/mL) were both greater in fasted horses (P /H11021.05, both). Median (range) time (h) to maximum plasma concentration(T max) in fasted horses was 2.0 (1.5 to 3.5) and in fed horses was 5.0 (1.0 to 8.0) and was not signicantlydifferent between groups. 4. Discussion In adult horses, delaying access to hay for 2 hoursafter oral minocycline administration improveddrug bioavailability. This has important implica-tions given that optimizing antimicrobial plasmaconcentrations is critical for effective treatment ofbacterial infections in adult horses.

Introduction Antibiotic therapy for horses has made many ad-vances that have provided equine practitioners moreoptions for treatment and accurate information toguide dose selection for the appropriate antibioticregimen. Signicant advances in pharmacokinet-ics, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD)exposure relationships, and susceptibility testingare among the developments that have contributedto this knowledge. Although there are few (if any)new antibiotics approved for equine use in the past20 years, we have learned to use the existing agentsmore effectively and learned more about extra-labeldrug uses from agents approved for people or otheranimal species. This discussion will review some ofthe important strategies for antibiotic use, PK-PDexposure relationships, and new advances in inter-pretation of susceptibility tests. 2. Activity of Antimicrobial Agents Against CommonBacteria If the bacteria are accurately identied, antibioticselection is simplied because the susceptibility pat-tern of many organisms is predictable. For exam-ple, if Streptococcus equi is identied, it is typically susceptible to penicillin, penicillin derivatives, andtrimethoprimsulfonamides. If Pasteurella multocidais identied, it tetracyclines, trimethoprim-sulfonamides, cephalosporins). On the other hand, ifStaphylococcus species are identied (methicillin- susceptible strains), they are often not susceptible topenicillin or tetracyclines, but should be fluoroquinolones, a few other classes suspected, the Bacteroides fragilis group), predictable results can be attained by administering penicillin and deriva-tives (ampicillin), chloramphenicol, metronidazole,and Pseudomonas aeruginosa represent bacteria frequently resistant to commonlyused antibiotics. Susceptibility is not predictable anda susceptibility test is be initiated with a fluoroquinolone 2017 However, if initial treatment is not effective,guidance from a susceptibility test is advised. ForPseudomonas aeruginosa , a susceptibility test is al- ways advised. 3. Basic Pharmacokinetic Principles The primary pharmacokinetic parameters of rele-vance to selecting doses for antimicrobial agents forhorses are absorption, distribution, metabolism, andclearance. Oral absorption is more of a challengein horses compared with people or small animals.Low oral absorption limits the use of this route toonly a few drug classes. Studies on distributionallow predictions of where the drug will distribute to(or not), in order to predict effectiveness. 4. Penetration to the Site of Infection For most tissues, antibiotic drug concentrations inthe serum or plasma approximate the drug concen-tration in the extracellular space (interstitial fluid).This is because there is no barrier that impedes drugdiffusion from the vascular compartment to extra-cellular tissue fluid. 1There is really no such thing as \"good penetration\" and \"poor penetration\" whenreferring to most drugs in tissues. Pores (fen-estrations) or microchannels in the endothelium ofcapillaries are large enough to allow drug moleculesto pass through unless the drug is restricted byprotein binding in the blood. If adequate drug con-centrations can be achieved in plasma, it is unlikelythat a barrier in the tissue will prevent drug diffu-sion to the site of infection as long as the tissue hasan adequate blood supply. Drug diffusion into anabscess or granulation tissue is sometimes a prob-lem because in these conditions, drug penetrationrelies on simple diffusion and these sites of infectionlacks adequate blood supply. In some tissues, a lipid membrane (such as tight junctions on capillaries) presents a barrier to drugdiffusion (Table 1). In these instances, a drug mustbe sufciently lipid soluble, or be actively carriedacross the membrane in order to reach effective con-centrations in tissues. These tissues include thecentral nervous system, eye, and prostate. A func-tional membrane pump (p-glycoprotein) also contrib-utes to the barrier. There also is a barrier betweenplasma and bronchial epithelium (blood:bronchusbarrier). This limits drug concentrations of somedrugs in the bronchial secretions and epithelialfluid of the airways. Lipophilic drugs may bemore likely to diffuse through the blood-bronchusbarrier and reach effective drug concentrations inbronchial secretions. 5. Local Factors that Affect Antibiotic Effectiveness Local tissue factors may decrease antimicrobial ef-fectiveness. For example, pus and necrotic debrismay bind vancomycin or aminoglyco-side antibiotics (gentamicin or amikacin), causingthem to be ineffective. Cellular material also candecrease the activity of topical agents such as poly-myxin B. Foreign material in a wound (such asmaterial surgically implanted) can protect bacteriafrom antibiotics and phagocytosis by forming a bio-lm (glycocalyx) at the site of infection. Cellulardebris and infected tissue can inhibit the action oftrimethoprim-sulfonamide combinations throughthe secretion of thymidine and PABA, both known tobe inhibitors of the action of these drugs. This mayexplain why trimethoprimsulfonamide combina-tions have not been effective in some infected tis-sues. Cations can adversely affect the activity ofantimicrobials at the site of infection. Two impor-tant drug groups diminished in activity by cationssuch as Mg iron, aluminum also can inhibitoral absorption of fluoroquinolones.) An acidic environment of infected tissue may decrease the effectiveness of clindamycin, erythro- mycin, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. Ananaerobic aminoglycosides because oxygen is necessary fordrug penetration into bacteria. As mentioned pre-viously, an adequate blood flow is necessary to de-liver an antibiotic to the site of infection. Effectiveantibacterial drug concentrations may not be at-tained in tissues that are poorly vascularized (e.g.extremities during shock, sequestered bone frag-ments, and endocardial valves). 6. PK-PD Optimization of Doses To achieve a cure, the drug concentration in plasma,serum, or tissue fluid should be maintained aboveTable 1. Tissue Barriers to Drug Diffusion Tissue Barrier Drugs that will Penetrate Brain Blood-brain barrier Fluoroquinolones (minimal), chloramphenicol minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), orsome multiple of the MIC, for at least a portion ofthe dose interval. PK-PD relationships of anti- biotics explain how these factors can correlate with clinical outcome. 2The parameters that dene an - tibacterial activity are taken from the shape of theplasma concentration vs time prole. The C MAX is simply the maximum plasma concentration attainedduring a dosing interval. The C MAX is related to the MIC by the CMAX:MIC ratio. The AUC is the total area under the curve. The AUC for a 24-hourperiod is related to the MIC value by the AUC:MICratio. The time-above-MIC is the relationship oftime to MIC measured in hours (T /H11022MIC; Fig. 1). Rather than consider a drug as simply bacterio- static or bactericidal, it is more useful to categorizedrugs as either concentration dependent or time de-pendent in its action. If concentration dependent,one should administer a high enough dose to maxi-mize the C MAX:MIC ratio or AUC:MIC ratio. If time dependent, the drug should be administeredfrequently enough to maximize the T /H11022MIC. Examples of how these relationships affect drug regimens are the drug concentration, the greaterthe bactericidal effect. This property is more im-portant for gram-negative than gram-positivecocci. An optimal bactericidal effect occurs if ahigh enough dose is administered to produce a peakof 8 to 10 times the MIC. This can be accomplishedby administering a single dose once daily. 3This regimen can be more effective and less nephrotoxicthan lower doses administered more frequently.The current regimens in horses employ this strategy.Fluoroquinolones For the fluoroquinolone antimicrobials, as reviewedby Wright 4and others, investigators have shown that either the peak plasma concentration abovebacterial MIC, also known as the C MAX:MIC ratio, or the total AUC above the MIC (also known as theAUC:MIC ratio), may predict clinical cure in studiesof laboratory animals, and in a limited number ofhuman clinical studies. There are no publishedstudies involving horses that indicate which of theseparameters are the best predictor of clinical cure, orwhat the respective target ratios might be. There-fore, the optimum value for these surrogate markershas not been determined for infections in horses.However, derived from other studies, a C MAX:MIC of 8 to 10, or a AUC:MIC of 75 to 100 have beenassociated with a cure. As reviewed by Wright, 4for some clinical situations AUC:MIC ratios as low as30 to 55 for a clinical cure. Beta-lactam Antibiotics /H9252-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, potentiated- aminopenicillins, and cephalosporins are bacteri-cidal but the process is slow and time dependent. Their concentration should be kept above the MIC throughout most of the dosing interval (long T /H11022 MIC) for the optimal bactericidal effect. 5Dosage regimens for the /H9252-lactam antibiotics should con- sider these PD relationships. To avoid the need forfrequent injections, some long-acting formulationshave been developed to prolong plasma concentra-tions (e.g. ceftiofur a). Gram-positive organisms are more susceptible to the /H9252-lactams than are gram- negative bacteria and lower doses and longer inter-vals are possible when treating these bacteria.Additionally, because antibacterial effects occur atconcentrations below the MIC (post antibiotic effect)forStaphylococcus , longer dose intervals may be possible for staphylococcal infections. Other Time-Dependent Drugs The drugs such as tetracyclines, (erythro-mycin and derivatives), sulfonamides, lincosamides(lincomycin act in a time-dependent manner againstmost bacteria. Either time above MIC (T /H11022MIC) or total drug exposure, measured as AUC/MIC, has beenused to predict clinical success for these drugs. The time-dependent activity is demonstrated by studies in which effectiveness is highest when thedrug concentrations are maintained above the MICthroughout the dosing interval. Drugs in this group should be administered frequently to achievethis goal. However, a property of some is that theypersist in tissues for a prolonged time, which allowsinfrequent dosing intervals. The macrolide deriva-tive azithromycin bhas a long half-life and long persistence in leukocytes to permit infrequentdosing. Most published dosage regimens are de-signed to take the PK properties of these drugs intoaccount. Fig. 1.

Application of Antibiotic Pharmacology Principlesto Susceptibility Testing Empirical treatment of common infections in ani-mals can be accomplished by selecting the antimi-crobial agent with a high likelihood of success for thesuspected clinical infection. Many guidelines haveappeared in published proceedings, review papers,consensus documents, and textbooks. But whenempirical treatment fails, or when resistance is sus-pected, a culture and susceptibility test is needed toguide therapy. Culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) will provide the best guidance for drug selec-tion. However, it is also understood that evenwhen an agent is selected from the \"susceptible\"category, treatment may not always be successful.The prediction of whether the bacteria will, or willnot respond to treatment is commonly referred to asthe \"90/60 rule.\" 6The 90/60 rule was derived from the observation that, in general, bacteria treatedwith antimicrobials to which the strain is suscepti-ble will have a favorable therapeutic response inapproximately 90% of the patients. On the otherhand, when the bacteria are resistant to the antimi-crobial administered, despite the susceptibility re-sult, approximately 60% of patients will respond totherapy. In veterinary medicine, we have no datato conrm or challenge the 90/60 rule. The most important information for the clinician is simply which drugs have an \"S\" and which oneshave an \"R.\" These results then guide their treat-ment. What really goes into this interpretation?The standards for interpretation are available fromthe Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute(CLSI) 7,8(found at http://www.clsi.org/). Not all laboratories use CLSI standards. It is a voluntaryprogram. However, it is the only global organiza-tion that develops susceptibility testing standardsfor animals. If a laboratory does not adhere to apublic standard such as CLSI, breakpoints may varyand interpretation may be inconsistent from labora-tory to laboratory. Microdilution Test for Determination of MIC It is becoming more common for laboratories to di-rectly measure the MIC of an organism with anantimicrobial dilution test. Zone inhibition (alsoknown as the Kirby-Bauer test) also is performedbut provides only qualitative information. TheMIC dilution test is performed by inoculating thewells of a plate with the bacterial culture and dilu-tions of antibiotics are arranged across the rows.The test is usually performed in modern laboratoriesusing high-throughput plates, but individual tubesor plates can be used for dilution tests also. Anti-biotic drug concentrations are arranged in serialdilutions, with each concentration doubled from low-est to highest in a range. The MIC is not a measureof efcacy, but instead it is simply an in vitro mea- surement of drug activity and bacterial susceptibil-ity. The lower the MIC value, the more susceptiblethe isolate is to that drug. The MICs are deter-mined using serial 2-fold dilutions (Log 2) of drug to which is added a standardized inoculum that is in-cubated for a prescribed time. Concentrations arealways listed in /H9262g/mL (mg/L). For example, if one were to start at a concentration of 256 /H9262g/mL, the MIC dilution series would be as follows: 128, 64,32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.12, and 0.06 /H9262g/mL, etc. If, for example, bacterial growth occurs at adilution of 0.12 /H9262g/mL for a specic drug, but not at 0.25 /H9262g/mL and above, the MIC is determined to be 0.25 /H9262g/mL. The MIC dilution test is only semi-quantitative because there are gaps betweeneach dilution. Realistically, the true MIC liessomewhere between these values, but the MIC isrecorded as the lowest concentration that inhibitsgrowth. Interpretation of Susceptibility Tests Resistance and susceptibility are determined bycomparing the organism's MIC to the drug's break-point as established by the Clinical and LaboratoryStandards Institute. 7,8After a laboratory deter - mines a MIC, it may use the CLSI \"SIR\" interpretivecategories: S, susceptible; I, intermediate, or R, resis-tant. In practice, if the MIC for the bacterial isolatefalls in the susceptible category, there is a greaterlikelihood of successful treatment (cure) than if theisolate were classied as resistant. It does not assuresuccess; drug failure is still possible owing to otherdrug or patient factors (for example, immune status,immaturity, or severe illness that compromises theaction of antibacterial drugs), and interactions. If theMIC is in the resistant category, bacteriologic failure ismore likely because of specic resistance mechanismsor inadequate drug concentrations in the patient.However, a patient with a competent immune systemmay sometimes eradicate an infection even when theisolate is resistant to the drug in the MIC test. The intermediate category is intended as a buffer zone between susceptible and resistant strains.This category reflects the possibility of error whenan isolate has a MIC that borders between suscep-tible and resistant. If the MIC value is in the in-termediate category, therapy with this drug at theusual standard dosage is discouraged because thereis a good likelihood that drug concentrations may beinadequate for a cure. However, successful ther-apy is possible when drug concentrates at certainsites\u2014in urine, or as the result of topical therapy,for example\u2014or at doses higher than the minimumeffective dose listed on the label. For example, pre-scribing guidelines for some antimicrobials allow for an increase in dose when susceptibility testingidenties an organism in the intermediate rangeof susceptibility. MIC data should not be used in isolation, but by coupling the MIC from a laboratory report withCLSI breakpoints and other important informationsuch as the virulence of the bacteria and the phar-macology of the antibiotics being considered, the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 387JUDICIOUS USE OF ANTIMICROBIALSclinician can make a more informed selection of anantibacterial drug. Does the Susceptibility Test Provide Tissue-SpecicInterpretation? The susceptibility interpretation is based on plasma/serum concentrations. No tissue-specic interpre-tation can be provided that accounts for differencesin drug distribution among tissues (exception forurine isolates for some agents). A frequent mistakein MIC interpretation is to compare the MIC withpublished tissue concentrations that are derivedfrom whole-tissue homogenized samples. Tissueconcentration data are often published by pharma-ceutical companies in their product information. Tissue concentrations may be misleading because they may either underestimate or overestimate (de-pending on the drug's afnity for intracellular sites) the true drug concentration at the site ofinfection. In most instances the clinician should not be con- cerned with the question of whether or not there are tissue-specic susceptibility interpretations.As discussed above, for most tissues, antibiotic drugconcentrations in the serum or plasma approximatethe drug concentration in the extracellular space(interstitial fluid). If adequate drug concentrationscan be achieved in plasma, it is unlikely that abarrier in the tissue will prevent drug diffusion tothe site of infection as long as the tissue has anadequate blood supply. Is Susceptibility Interpretation by CLSI Specic forVeterinary Species? In past years, the veterinary diagnostic laborato-ries had to rely heavily on the CLSI interpretationfrom the human standards. There were not enough veterinary-specic breakpoints in the interpretivecategories available for veterinary drugs and veter-inary species. This is now changing. The currentedition of the CLSI standard document 7,8for veter - inary drugs has the tables clearly separated intothose drugs with veterinary interpretive criteria,and drugs that still rely on human standards forinterpretation. In the last several years, CLSI hastremendously expanded the list of drugs for lished for other antibiotics used in horses, we willcontinue to rely on the human breakpoints in these gaps. How Are Breakpoints Derived? The paper by Turnidge and Paterson9describes in detail the process of setting breakpoints. The CLSIsubcommittee for Veterinary Antimicrobial Suscep-tibility Testing (VAST), uses strict criteria to estab-lish and evaluate breakpoints. Sponsors arerequired to follow guidelines provided by CLSI andmust submit data to support a proposed breakpoint.The data includes PK data in the target species,MIC distributions for the pathogens targeted, clini-cal data from the drug used under eld conditions atthe approved dose, and PK-PD analysis, usingMonte Carlo simulations 10to show that at the ap - proved dose the drug attains PK-PD targets for thelabeled pathogen. 2 Are These Standards or Guidelines? The CLSI is a consensus-driven process and afterapproval by the subcommittee the standards becomepublic documents. The consensus process involvesthe development and review of documents, revisionof documents in response to discussion, and, nally,the acceptance of a document as a consensus stan-dard or guideline. The CLSI documents used forculture and susceptibility testing should be re-garded as a public standard, not a guideline. A Standard is a document developed through the consensus process that clearly identies specic, es-sential requirements for materials, methods, orpractices for use in an unmodied form. A Stan- dard may, in addition, contain discretionary ele- ments, which are clearly identied. A Guideline is a document developed through the consensus pro-cess describing criteria for a general operating prac-tice, procedure, or material for voluntary use. AGuideline may be used as written or modied by theuser to t specic needs.

The Relevance of Antimicrobial Resistance It is useful to consider what antimicrobial resistancemeans from microbiological and clinical stand-points. Resistance simply means that a bacterium has an inherent or acquired ability to evade inhibi-tion or killing by an antimicrobial. This does notnecessarily mean there is any difference in ability tocause disease, likelihood of causing severe disease,or other clinically relevant factors. Antimicrobialresistance in itself is not a virulence factor. How-ever, resistance can affect clinical outcome. It isimportant to note that beyond the need for a differ-ent drug, the overall approach to resistant infectionsdoes not differ from infections caused by susceptiblepathogens. This highlights the importance of prompt identication of resistant infections, so thatproper treatment can be initiated. Similarly, if anantimicrobial susceptible pathogen would be dis-missed as irrelevant based on a culture result, thesame approach is almost always indicated for a resistant pathogen. Treatment decisions, bothwhether to treat and what to do in addition to anti-microbials, are not inherently different in infectionscaused by resistant vs susceptible bacteria. Con-cerns about untreatable infections caused by bacte-ria that are resistant to all available antimicrobialscontinue to increase, and are approaching reality inhuman medicine. The same degree of resistance isnot typically identied in equine pathogens; how-ever, the limited number of drugs that can be safelyand effectively used in horses means that infectionswith few viable options may be encountered. Yet, itis important to remember that the vast majority ofinfections are treatable with routinely used drugs,and there is almost always a viable antimicrobialoption. The key aspect, and one that cannot beoveremphasized, is the need for early recognition ofresistant infections so that proper treatment can beinitiated. Although resistant pathogens are nomore inherently virulent than their susceptiblecounterparts, empirical treatment using ineffectivedrugs can certainly worsen the prognosis. In es-sence, horses do not die or have poor outcomes from 390 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSJUDICIOUS USE OF ANTIMICROBIALS NOTESantibiotic resistance, occur because of an un-treated disease process. Antimicrobial resistanceincreases the likelihood that initial antimicrobialsare ineffective, highlighting the value of prompt andeffective diagnostic testing. 3. Notable Antimicrobial Resistant Pathogens Although antimicrobial resistance of some form maybe present in virtually any bacterial species, themain effect of resistance comes from a relativelylimited number of bacteria. These tend to be bac-teria that commonly cause opportunistic infectionsand that are often present as part of the commensalmicrobiota. Those properties mean that there canbe abundant exposure to antimicrobials over time,and that resistant forms can spread silently in thehealthy horse population. Staphylococci Staphylococci are classical opportunistic pathogensthat are particularly adept at causing skin and skinstructure infections. From the rst emergence ofpenicillin resistance shortly after the discovery ofpenicillin to identication of virtually pan resistantstrains in humans, staphylococci have createdsubstantial challenges. The emergence (MR) staphylococci, particu-larly S.aureus (MRSA), as important veterinary pathogens in the 1990s and 2000s, ushered in a newera of concern about difcult-to-treat and zoonoticinfections. Staphylococci are common mucosal col-onizers, and most (if not all) horses harbor one ormore Staphylococcus at any time. Methicillin re- sistance is not uncommonly found in staphylococcifrom healthy predominantly minimallyvirulent but occa-sionally in S.aureus (a coagulase-positive be found in the nasal passages, orophar-ynx, or gastrointestinal tract of a small percentageof horses, with most reports describing prevalencesof 0% to 5% in the general horse population. 1-5 Higher rates can be found in certain populations,such as hospitalized horses. 1,6,7While antimicro - bial exposure and hospitalization are risk factors forMRSA shedding, 1,8MRSA can be isolated from horses in the absence of known exposure or riskfactors. MRSA colonization can be found in horsesinternationally, although the relative strain distri-bution tends to vary. In North America, MRSAstrains found in horses are typically human clones,particularly USA500 (an uncommon human strainthat may be horse adapted) and USA100 (the lead-ing MRSA strain in human healthcare facilities inthe United States). 5,9,10In contrast, the livestock associated sequence type 398 clone tends to predom-inate in Europe. 11-14A rarer variant of MRSA containing a different (and more-difcult-to-detect)methicillin-resistance gene, mecC, has been identi- ed in a small number of European horses. 15 In horses, skin and wound infections (including surgical site infections) along with infections associ-ated with joint injections are the most commonlyencountered staphylococcal infections, with S.au- reus being the main species involved. The canine- origin S.pseudintermedius , including its MR variant (MRSP), are occasionally identied inequine infections. 16-18A wide range of other staphylococci, predominantly coagulase-negativespecies, can be isolated from clinical infections.However, this group of staphylococci is commonlyfound on the skin and tends to be of limited viru-lence. Therefore, coagulase-negative staphylococci are often present as commensals or contaminants,rather than causes of disease. This is important todifferentiate because coagulase-negative staphylococciare often multidrug resistant, and it is important todetermine whether they need to be targeted or ignoredclinically. Most MRSA isolates found in horses are suscep- tible to one or more drugs that can be used inhorses, such as aminoglycosides or chloramphen-icol. Although sometimes undesirable, thesedrugs can be effective, and drug selection forMRSA infections must consider the susceptibilityprole of the isolate, the location of infection, andissues relating to the different drug options (e.g.,safety, penetration, route of administration).Limited systemic options highlight the potentialusefulness of local therapy. This can include top-ical therapy for skin and supercial soft-tissueinfections gel matri-ces). These can deliver high local concentrations,sometimes for sustained periods, with limited sys-temic exposure.PseudomonasPseudomonas is a genus of gram-negative bacteria that thrives in moist environments, both on and offthe host. As with staphylococci, Pseudomonas in- fections are almost always (if not always) in re-sponse to an underlying disease process, with woundinfections being a common manifestation of Pseu- domonas in horses. Pseudomonas infections can be challenging to treat for many reasons. Pseudomo- nasspp. are intrinsically resistant to many antimi- crobials (e.g., most penicillins and cephalosporins)and often acquire Susceptibil-ity to anti-pseudomonal cephalosporins (e.g., cefta-zidime) and aminoglycosides remains high, 19,20 although resistance to either can be found and thismay vary geographically. Fluoroquinolone resis-tance is relatively common 19,21-23and can develop quickly during monotherapy. Combination ther-apy is often used when treating Pseudomonas infec- tions in humans, both for synergistic effects and toreduce the likelihood of emergence of resistance.This is less commonly used in horses, probably AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 391JUDICIOUS USE OF ANTIMICROBIALSmainly because of cost rather than lack of need, butshould be considered when parenteral treatment isneeded. Pseudomonas also tend to be heavy biolm producers, and biolm can inhibit the activity ofantimicrobials and the immune response, leadingto poor response despite in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility. Topical therapy for supercial infections can be useful to overcome resistance, allow for the use of antimicrobi-als that are not safe to use systemically (e.g., polymixinB) or avoid the need for systemic drugs. Topical ther-apy can involve biocides (e.g., chlorhexidine) or antimi- crobials (e.g., polymixin, gentamicin). Resistance toboth can be present but clinically relevant resistanceto the concentrations that can be delivered locally israre. Adjunctive therapies, such as the use of Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to enhanceantibacterial effects 24,25may be useful locally. An - other aspect of note about Pseudomonas is its ability to survive in water, be resistant to some disinfectantsand be a source of hospital- and equipment-associatedinfections. Enterobacteriaceae Enterobacteriaceae is a family of Gram-negativebacteria includes and human pathogenssuch as E.coli, Enterobacter ,Proteus ,Salmonella , and Klebsiella . These bacteria can be involved in a variety of infections, and antimicrobial resistance isof increasing concern. Multidrug-resistant Entero-bacteriaceae might represent the most dramatic and important shift in resistance patterns inhorses during the past few years. A few differenttypes of resistance, mediated by a wide (and some-time confusing) collection of resistance genes, canbe involved. Beta-lactamase production is common among Enterobacteriaceae and confers resistance to peni-cillins (e.g., ampicillin, amoxicillin) but not cephalo-sporins. It can often be controlled theaddition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (e.g., sulbac-tam). Beta-lactamase-producing known and widely disseminated. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes that confer a broader degree of resistance.ESBLs are effective against extended-spectrumcephalosporins (e.g., ceftiofur, by beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanicacid or sulbactam although clinical response to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations canbe unpredictable. ESBL-producing bacteria aredisseminated widely in humans in a highly diversepopulation of Enterobacteriaceae, and are signi-cant causes of disease, particularly in hospitals andlong-term care facilities. Although currently less ofa concern than in humans, ESBLs are increasinglybeing identied in horses, both in equine hospitalsand on farms. The ongoing emergence of ESBLsmay represent a greater threat to horses than thehigher-prole emergence of MRSA in the horse pop-ulation. The emergence of ESBLs may be both aresult of emergence of resistance in the horse popu-lation and transmission of resistant strains fromhumans, given that the same ESBL-containingbacteria have been found in both humans andhorses. 26,27 ESBL-producing bacteria cause the same types of infections as their susceptible counterparts, such aswound infections, neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, andurinary tract infection. Because ESBL-producingbacteria tend to be species that are common gutcommensals, accumulation of ESBLs in the gut ofhealthy horses and dissemination throughout thehorse population is a concern. Surveillance studieshave identied highly concerning ESBL prevalencerates in some populations, such as a study thatfound ESBLs in 84% of horses at an equine clinic inThe Netherlands. 28Reports from only a few years prior in other countries identied much lower rates(e.g., 6.3% in the United Kingdom). 3Whether that represents marked geographic variation or a pro-found increase in a short period of time is unknown,but it is hard to deny that ESBLs are more fre-quently identied in horses internationally. A ret-rospective study of E.coliisolates from horses in Switzerland reported an ESBL prevalence of 60%, 29 with even higher rates noted elsewhere,30highlight - ing the potential clinical challenges. Antimicrobialexposure has been shown to increase the risk ofESBL shedding 3,31; however, fecal shedding can be detected in the absence of known antimicrobial ex-posure or hospitalization, as is also the case withMRSA. Management of infections caused by ESBL produc- ing bacteria can be complicated because of limiteddrug options. Antimicrobial options depend on sus-ceptibility to other antimicrobials as ESBL-producingbacteria have often also acquired resistance to otherantimicrobials (e.g., fluoroquinolones). 32Cefoxitin (a cefamycin, not a cephalosporin) can be an effec-tive option in some situations; however, response tothis antimicrobial can be unpredictable. Dosingregimens (route and frequency) are also problematicfor outpatients. Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhib-itor (e.g., beta-lactam with clavulanic acid, sulbac-tam, and tazobactam) combinations may beeffective, but that depends on the amount of ESBLproduction, as high production of ESBLs (especiallywhen more than one gene is involved) can over-whelm the beta-lactamase inhibitor. Amikacin andcarbapenems are often the main viable choices, bothof which can be clinically effective but are oftenundesirable because of factors such as the need forparenteral injection, toxicity, and for carbapenems,their importance in human medicine. Some iso-lates may be susceptible to other drug classes thathave activity against Gram-negative bacteria (e.g.,tetracyclines, /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSJUDICIOUS USE OF ANTIMICROBIALSrently acquired resistance to many or all of theseother classes. The similarity of some ESBL genes and ESBL- producing bacteria found in humans and horses in-dicates that human-animal transmission may be animportant route of infection of veterinary patients,but also indicates that there must be concern aboutthe potential for zoonotic transmission from infectedor colonized animals, although the true role of ani-mals in human infections is not known. Similar to (and sometimes confused with) ESBLs, AmpC (CMY-2) beta-lactamases confer resistance topenicillins and cephalosporins, addition theyconfer resistance to cephamycins such as cefoxitin.They are also resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitors.Carbapenems or aminoglycosides tend to be themain options for treatment of infected horses, al-though as with ESBLs, other drugs such as trim-ethoprim-sulfa, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, andfluoroquinolones may be effective in some situa-tions. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing resultsare needed to guide effective therapy. Carbapenems are uncommonly used in horses, and mainly in neonatal intensive care units. Emer-gence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteri-aceae (CPE) is a critically important emerging issuein human health care. Carbapenemases are a di-verse group of enzymes with variable efcacyagainst carbepenems (e.g., meropenem) as well asmost other beta-lactams. They confer resistance topenicillins, carbapenems, and, depending on thegene that is involved, potentially all cephalosporins,and therefore have a broad range of resistance thatis often complemented with acquired resistanceto various other drug classes. The effect of beta-lactamase inhibitors is variable and often weak,leading to CPE infections where there may be fewviable treatment options. There are only rare re-ports of CPE in animals 30,33but CPE have been identied in a horse in Europe,30with anecdotal reports on infections in horses in North America.This may relate to \"spillover\" from humans, withCPE in animals reflecting movement of CPE intohumans in the community, but that has yet to beconrmed. Although CPEs constitute a critically important human health care issue, they are not the \"ultimatesuperbug.\" In the past few years, Enterobacteri-aceae resistant to almost all, or all, antimicrobialshave been identied, with particular emphasis onthe emergence of colistin resistance. 34,35These have also been found in animals, including compan-ion animals, 36and although these highly resistant pathogens are unlikely to become important equinepathogens, the potential role of animals as reser-voirs and sources of human infection is of muchconcern. From a more common and clinically important standpoint, fluoroquinolone resistance continues tobe a problem. Fluoroquinolones can be excellentdrugs against Gram-negative pathogens but resis-tance can emerge through various mechanisms, in-cluding mutation (e.g., mutations in DNA gyrase ortopoisomerase IV genes) or acquisition of genes (e.g.,those that decrease drug uptake or mediate effluxpumps). Single-step mutations may have variableeffects on bacterial minimum inhibitory concentra-tions (MICs), ranging from subtle changes in MICwith continued susceptibility to resistance. Accu-mulation of multiple mutations is most often asso-ciated with clinical resistance, with resistance to onefluoroquinolone typically meaning that resistance ispresent to all fluoroquinolones (albeit there is somepotential variability between drugs, with MICs oftenbeing lower to newer fluoroquinolones). 37 Enterococcus This genus includes a variety of species of varyingclinical relevance. Most infections are caused bytwo species, E.faecium and E.faecalis , both of which can often be associated with multidrug resistance.Enterococci are inherently resistant to a variety ofdrug classes (e.g., penicillin, trimethoprim), somedrug classes have poor efcacy vivo (e.g., cepha- losporins, fluoroquinolones) and acquisition of resis-tance genes is not uncommon. Therefore, they areat best potentially susceptible to only a limitedrange of \"routine\" veterinary drugs, and multidrugresistance is not uncommon. Enterococci resistantto all routinely tested drugs are not unusual andpose challenges. Yet, despite the commonness of antimicrobial re- sistance, enterococci tend to be of limited virulence.A major challenge in dealing with cultures yieldingenterococci is determining the clinical relevance.Enterococci can cause opportunistic infections suchas wound infections and neonatal sepsis. 38,39How - ever, they are often present as contaminants, com-mensals, or co-infections, and isolation of anEnterococcus from an infected site does not always mean that treatment is needed. That is particu-larly true when an Enterococcus is isolated along- side a more convincing pathogen (e.g., S.aureus, Enterobacteriaceae) and treatment of the other organ-ism will often result in clinical cure. Thus, decidingwhether to treat an Enterococcus , particularly a highly drug-resistant isolate that may require an undesirabledrug, is an important factor. Others Antimicrobial resistance is not restricted to the above-described groups. Some, such as Serratia and Acin- etobacter , are commonly multidrug resistant. These are uncommon causes of infection, but can be difcultto treat. Virtually any clinically relevant bacteriumcan be resistant to antimicrobials, and on the individ-ual patient level, that resistance may range from in-nocuous to life threatening, largely based on theseverity of disease, rapidity of identication of resis-tance, and time to start of appropriate therapy. How-ever, in contrast, antimicrobial resistance is rare zooepidemicus ,40-42despite the widespread presence of this bacterium and frequent antimicrobialexposure. Why resistance has developed so widely toS.aureus but not S.zooepidemicus , bacteria that are both common mucosal commensals and widely dis-persed in the horse population internationally, is enig-matic, and is one of many interesting and unansweredquestions. 4. Conclusions Antimicrobial resistance is a problem that will con-tinue to challenge veterinarians and antimicrobialuse in veterinary medicine will continue to comeunder scrutiny. Although currently limited in vet-erinary medicine, efforts to move toward a broader\"antimicrobial stewardship program\" approach arebecoming prominent in human medicine and bearconsideration for equine medicine. This includesvarious approaches to optimize (not just restrict)antimicrobial use and is beyond the scope of thisdiscussion. However, basic aspects such as ensur-ing prompt collection of culture specimens wheneverpossible, collecting samples from appropriate sitesto reduce the risk of contamination, use of a labora-tory that follows standardized testing and reportingguidelines, scrutinizing culture results to identifypotential contaminants or spurious results, usingresources to ensure proper dosing regimens andremembering to assess the patient as a whole, notjust the laboratory result, are practical yet impor-tant measures to optimize treatment of bacterialinfections.

The most common manifestation of R. equi infections in foals is a chronic suppurative bron- chopneumonia with extensive abscessation. Theslow spread of the lung infection combined withthe remarkable ability of foals to compensate for theprogressive loss of functional lung, make early clin-ical diagnosis difcult. Early clinical signs oftenonly consist of a mild fever or a slight increase inrespiratory rate that may not be apparent unlessfoals are exercised or stressed by handling. As thedisease progresses, clinical signs may include de-creased appetite, lethargy, cough, fever, tachypnea,and labored breathing. Nasal discharge is an incon- sistent nding. Because ultrasonographic screeningfor early detection has become routine practice atmany farms endemic for pneumonia caused by R.equi, the most frequently recognized form of R.equi infec- tion on those farms is a subclinical form in which foalsdevelop sonographic evidence of peripheral pulmonaryconsolidation or abscessation without manifestingclinical signs. 1,2R.equi can also be cultured from alarge variety of extrapulmonary sites of infection.Extrapulmonary disorders might occur concurrentwith or independent of pneumonia, and some foalshave multiple extrapulmonary disorders concur-rently. 3,4This article reviews recent data document- ing spontaneous resolution of pulmonary lesions in ahigh proportion of subclinically affected foals and ad-dresses current controversies in the treatment of in-fections caused by R.equi. 2. Not All Foals with Subclinical Pulmonary LesionsNeed to be Treated Over the past 17 years, control of R.equi infections at many farms where the disease is endemic hasrelied on early detection of subclinical pulmonarydisease using thoracic ultrasonography and initia-tion of treatment with antimicrobial agents prior todevelopment of clinical signs. 1,2,5The rationale for screening is the assumption that detecting foals inthe early stages of disease along with appropriatetreatment of affected foals will improve outcome.Although controlled studies are lacking, periodic ul-trasonography of the chest seems to have decreasedmortality due to R.equi pneumonia at some farms relative to historical controls. 1,2,5However, ultra- sonographic screening has resulted in an presumptive use of macrolides and rifampin becauseof ultrasonographic screening and a perceived in-crease in the frequency of detection of resistant iso-lates in the last decade 6suggest that this practice might not be innocuous. Emergence of widespreadmacrolide- and rifampin-resistance at a farm afterwidespread use of these drugs was instituted as partof an ultrasonographic screening program has beendocumented. 7 Recent controlled studies have documented that approximately 70% to 88% of foals with smallpulmonary lesions (sum of lesion diameters [orlesion score] of 1 to 10 cm) recover without anti-microbial therapy. 8-10In addition, antimicrobial treatment of foals with such small ultrasono-graphic lesions does not signicantly hasten lesionresolution compared with administration of a pla-cebo. 8,9In contrast, studies performed at the same farm documented that treatment of foalswith lesion scores /H1102210 cm provides a signicant benet relative to administration of a placebo. 11,12 Additional studies are needed to establish bettercriteria to determine the need for therapy in sub-clinically affected foals and to better quantify therisks vs benets of treating foals with subclinicalultrasonographic lesions. 3. The Combination of a Macrolide with RifampinRemains the Treatment of Choice for ClinicallyAffected Foals A wide variety of antimicrobial agents are activeagainst R.equi in vitro. However, because R.equi a facultative intracellular pathogen surviving and rep-licating in macrophages and therefore causes granulo-matous lesions with thick caseous material, manyof these drugs are believed to be ineffective in vivo . The combination of rifampin and erythromycin be-came the treatment of choice in the 1980s and hasreduced foal mortality relative to historical data sinceits introduction. years, clarithromycin orazithromycin, two rifampin are highly activeagainst R.equi in vitro but only exert bacteriostatic activity. Of the three macrolides listed above clari-thromycin is the most active against R.equi in vitro . The combination of a macrolide and rifampin is syn-ergistic both in vitro and in vivo 13-15and the use of the two classes of drugs in combination reduces the likeli-hood of R.equi resistance to either drug. Recent studies demonstrate that concurrent ther- apy with rifampin considerably decreases plasma, pul-monary epithelial lining fluid, and bronchoalveolarcell concentrations of clarithromycin and possiblyother macrolides most likely through inhibition of in-testinal-uptake transporters. 16,17These ndings have led many to question the value of the combina-tion. A well-designed, large-scale blinded clinicaltrial is needed to determine the benet (or detriment)of combining a macrolide with rifampin for treatingfoals with severe R.equi pneumonia. However, such a study is unlikely to be performed owing to the verylarge sample size that would be required, clinicianpreferences, and logistical and nancial requirementsfor its conduct. In the meantime, we have over 30years of experience and retrospective data 18-21sup- porting the efcacy of the combination as well as ani-mal models documenting the superiority of thecombination 22,23vs a complete lack of evidence that macrolide monotherapy is effective in foals with severeclinical pneumonia. Until it is documented that amacrolide alone is as effective as the combinationwith rifampin, the combination of a macrolide(erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin)with rifampin remains the recommended treat-ment for foals with clinical disease resulting frompneumonia. 24 Acknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Author has adhered to the Principles of Veter-inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Author has no conflicts of interest.

Introduction Bacterial sepsis leading cause of morbidityand mortality in neonatal foals. 1Many of the the neonatal of foals less a high likelihood of bacterial sepsisand antimicrobial therapy is often indicated. Theneonatal period represents a time of rapid growthand development. Changes in body compositionand proportions, liver mass, metabolic activity, andrenal function collectively affect the pharmacoki-netic behavior of many antimicrobial agents. Thistext summarizes the age-related differences in thebioavailability and disposition of antimicrobialdrugs and reviews the principles of antimicrobialtherapy in equine neonates. 2. Absorption beta-lactam and cause digestive disturbances inadult horses can be administered orally to neonataland young (up to approximately 4 months of age)foals for the treatment of systemic bacterial infec-tions caused by susceptible microorganisms. Forexample, oral bioavailability of amoxicillin is 30% compared 5% to15% in adult horses. 2Similarly, oral bioavail- ability (5% at1 at 2 months, 20% at 3 months, and15% at 5 months of age. 3This progressive decrease in oral bioavailability with increasing age does notoccur for all beta-lactam antimicrobial agents. Forexample, the relative oral bioavailability of cefpo-doxime proxetil is similar between 7- to 14-day-oldfoals, 3- to 4-month-old foals, and adult horses. 4 The effect of age on oral bioavailability has not beenstudied as extensively for other classes of antimicro-bial agents. Given that disposition refers to the simultaneous effects of distribution and elimination, it is neces-sary to consider both components of the processwhen interpreting changes that occur during theneonatal period or in the presence of a disease state.In contrast with neonates of other domestic animalspecies, glomerular ltration rate and effective renalplasma flow remain relatively constant throughoutthe postnatal period in foals and are similar to orhigher than that of adult horses. 5,6Less is known regarding hepatic maturation of the equine neonatein the perinatal period but evidence from the study PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 conjugation)suggest that the microsomal-associated metabolicpathway develops far more rapidly in foals (within 1week) than in neonates of other species. 7The - macokinetic parameters describing the dispositionof gentamicin or 12 mg/kg, IV) indicate aprofound and signicant decrease in eliminationhalf-life and apparent volume of distribution withincreasing age with most changes occurring withinthe rst 2 to 4 weeks of life. 8,9Given that the distribution of gentamicin is virtually restricted tothe extracellular fluid (ECF), these ndings are con-sistent with the fact that ECF volume is larger inyoung foals than in adult horses. As a result of thelarger volume of distribution, higher doses of ami-noglycosides are recommended in foals less than 2to 4 weeks of age. After 2 to 4 weeks of age,dosages recommended for adult horses are ade-quate (Table 1). The direct effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents in the neonatalperiod has not been studied extensively. As ex-pected, the volume of distribution of ticarcillin andcefquinome was signicantly larger in neonatal (/H113493days) than in older foals (4 to 6 weeks). 10,11In contrast, half-life, systemic clearance, and volume ofdistribution of desfuroylceftiofur acetamide after in-Table 1.

Thecombination of an aminoglycoside (preferably ami-kacin or gentamicin) with either penicillin, ampicil-lin, or ceftiofur is often initiated until culture resultsare available (Table 2). Such combination providesadequate coverage against approximately 90% ofbacterial isolates recovered from blood cultures. 16,17 Amikacin, although more expensive, is preferred togentamicin because of its lower frequency of resis-tance among Enterobacteriaceae. 13,17,18Similarly, ampicillin is preferred to penicillin or ceftiofur be-cause of its higher activity against enterococci. 17 In situations when an aminoglycoside should not beused such as renal failure, adequate coverage isprovided by a third- or fourth-generation cephalo-sporin such as cefotaxime or cefepime, respectively.Suggested for pathogens foals are presented inTable 3.

Recumbent horses are fractious, frustratingly dif-cult, and very dangerous to handle. Even dead horses represent a signicant challenge to manipu-late for staff safety due to their great weight andsize. 1Safe manipulation requires knowledge of anatomy and physiology to prevent injury when em-placing webbing or slings, 2as well as proper person- nel positioning (Table 1). The conned spaces thatanimals commonly are found (inside stalls, trailers,or entrapped in equipment or topography) requireappropriate personal protective equipment such ashelmets; and may require reaching, prying, and cut-ting tools (Fig. 1). Strategies and equipment tomitigate these situations in various recumbent po-sitions (Table 2) are available but underutilized byresponders; the effectiveness of proper response sys-tems is further emphasized by appropriate proce-dures, equipment, training, and emergency drills. Slides, drags, vertical lifts, and assists are basic to technical large animal emergency rescue\u2014a spe-cialty form of heavy rescue in the Fire and RescueServices that is intimately tied to the veterinarypractitioner's expertise and advice. Some poorermethods that well-intentioned \"rescuers\" have usedin the past reflect our predatory human instincts tosolve the problem\u2014but have caused iatrogenic in-jury in (traumatic amputations,lacerations, asphyxiation, corneal damage, myop-athy, neurologic injury, etc. 3). Ironically, horses do not instinctively understand how to help them-selves, or have the capacity to understand that re-sponders are there to help. The use of the methods presented here represent viable options for the successful extrication andtransport of horses 4trapped during a disaster or emergency, or dead. Use of these equipment andprocedures requires planning, coordination of re-sources, and personnel placement. For these rea-sons there is a need to coordinate the effort better tokeep the victim, the practitioner, and their staff outof harm's way. Many animals, when manipulatedout of the entrapment or enabled to roll to sternal,will rise and stand on their own; thus, facilitatingself rescue is the best use of manipulations methods. The purpose of this article is to suggest methods for response to horses that are recumbent due tobeing geriatric, debilitated, injured, or in daily /H114082017 403MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEM NOTESclinical situations or as part of a technical rescueresponse scenario, while presenting simple tech-niques for manipulation of recumbent horses, andwill place emphasis on the use of simple tools, web-bing, equipment, and proper positioning of person-nel to achieve safer and more effective results whenmoving recumbent (live or dead) horses in varioussituations commonly encountered in the practitio-ners' daily work. 2. Materials and Methods Two pieces of 5-m-long, 10-cm-wide webbing or 2.5-cm-thick cotton rope (ponies Two pieces of 10-m-long, 10-cm-wide webbing or 2.5-cm-thick cotton rope (draft horses). Cane or Boat Hook or Painters Pole for exten- sion of the arm and guidance of webbing. Two pieces of 2-m-long, 10-cm-wide webbing with looped chest stra p 1 m long; two prussick hitches 20 cm long, and overheadspreader bar for attachment to tractor/backhoeor chain hoist\u2014or Hast Becker Sling System. Rolling a Cast Horse Horses commonly get \"cast\" in various positions installs (up against the wall), in depressions or ditches(in pastures and paddocks), and trapped where theycannot right themselves (fences or other obstacles)(Fig. 2). Since this often occurs to a horse that isnot otherwise injured or sick, the animal is \"fullycharged\" and capable of injuring a person easily.Geriatric or debilitated animals may need medicalattention immediately. There are conditions where Fig. 1. Preparing a recumbent horse in a conned space of a stallfor transportation on a Rescue Glide to denitive veterinarycare. Attendants are approaching from the dorsal side of theanimal, which is sedated, blindfolded, and hobbled for physicaland chemical restraint.

Do not attach anything to the head, neck, or legs to pull on (only for guidance as in a halter). If you must use the legs (dorsally recumbent) then use webbing and padding to protect the delicate structures of the legs, but be very cautious of beinginside the kill zone while attaching anything to legs or feet\u2014Best Practice\u2014approach from the dorsal side of the animal. 2. Use webbing with looped ends (instead of ropes) for any type of manipulation. The greater surface area and flat surface of the webbing will minimize injury to the skin and underlying structures. Or use padding to protect soft tissue structures. 3. Best Practice\u2014use the pectoral and pelvic girdles as the attachment point for any manipulations. The muscle and bone structures here will protect the delicate soft structures (nerve, blood vessels, tendons, and ligaments) beneath. 4. Do not use the tail as an attachment point for any mechanical manipulations\u2014only careful manual movement of the recumbent horse by no more than two people. It can be broken, injured, or traumatically amputated by application of excessiveforce. 5. Use a blindfold while horses are recumbent, to protect the downside eye and relax the animal. Ensure it is easily removable\u2014a blindfold should be fastened so that it will fall off if the person handling the animal loses control of theanimal. Panicked horses that get up and run loose with the blindfold still on will run in a straight line in fear until hitting asolid object or falls. The danger to people and the horse is palpable. 6. Whenever possible\u2014allow the animal to self rescue\u2014leave the legs free and the head and neck should have free movement so that the animal can balance and use their legs to assist themselves to get up and move out of the entrapment. A halter andlead rope are not intended for pulling the animal out\u2014they are for guidance only. 7. Sedation and/or anaesthesia should be carefully evaluated by the practitioner based on the animal's medical status, time in situ, and potential for injury to a person or itself. Helmets should be worn when working with recumbent animals, especiallyby the animal handler. 8. Protection of the downside eye is assumed in all of the methods described herein\u2014horses use their head and neck as a lever to rise and when struggling may cause serious injury to an unprotected eye. 9. Always treat even dead animals with respectful and professional methods\u2014you never know who is watching or taking a video. Social media is ever present. 404 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMthe attending practitioner may not wish to roll theanimal out of this position for medical reasons\u2014inthose cases one of the variations of the ForwardAssist, Sideways Slide, or Backwards Drag shouldbe selected. There are three efcient congurations of correct- ing this cast entrapment position\u2014SIMPLE ONELEG, SIMPLE TWO LEG, and WEB ASSIST ROLL.In each case, pieces of 5-m-long, 10-cm-wide web-bing or 2.5-cm-thick cotton rope may be used to rollthe animal over the dorsum (use the longer webbing:10 m for draft horses). This procedure assumes that if the animals' leg(s) or head are entrapped that they are going to becorrected rst, before attempting to solve the castcondition. It also assumes that before the animalis rolled in a conned space (trailer, stall, ditch)that people performing the procedure have a pre-dened escape route\u2014as the animal comes over, itwill often frantically attempt to stand. Afxing ahalter with leadrope on the animal before rollingit and assigning one person as the animal handlerwill ensure better control of the horse when it getsup. SIMPLE ONE LEG (Fig. 3)\u2014 This method allows a limited number of people to be successful atrolling the horse out of the cast position, or can beused in conned spaces where there is minimalroom for an escape route by people. Because thepelvis of the horse is xed, attaching rope or web-bing to the downside hind leg at the pastern, thenrolling the animal over the dorsum at a 45\u00b0 anglefrom over the shoulder will ensure that the rest ofthe horse easily rolls when pulled. The rope orwebbing should be placed on the pastern from asafer position at the dorsum\u2014using a cane or longTable 2. Recumbency Denitions Anterior: Occurs most often in animals involved in transportation incidents where the trailer goes nose down into a ditch, waterway, hole, or embankment and horses are not able to rise, where their heads are well below the rest of theirbodies. Often the neck will be found at strange angles which impacts breathing, and the sheer weight of the abdominalcontents pushes down on the lungs. A very rarely survivable scenario unless attended efciently. Posterior: Common in animals that fall into holes, ditches, or other obstacles where the rump is well below the rest of their body. Dorsal: Befalls horses that fall or are thrust into a tight space and end up on their backs with their hooves pointed upward\u2014 this might be a water tank, feed bunk, ditch, horse trailer wreck, hole, or creek. Lateral: Most common position for a \"downed\" animal due to various scenarios from geriatric inability to get up, to injured, to debilitated to technical rescue scenarios. The sheer weight of the animal contributes over time to compartment/crushsyndromes, myopathies, neuropathies and requires that the animal be attended quickly\u2014within 4 hours of being down for thebest opportunity at recovery. Sternal: The animal is laying on its ventral surface with legs either trapped in a downward position or folded and resting upon them. This is a preferred position for completing technical rescue scenarios at hand off to the veterinarian, and is consideredthe \"recovery position\" for downed equines. Fig. 2.

SIMPLE TWO LEG (Fig. 4)\u2014When more people are available to assist with rolling the animal, orwhere the rescuers have more room for an escaperoute, this method is useful. Attaching rope orwebbing to the downside legs (front and rear) from asafe position at the dorsum\u2014using a cane or longboat hook or painter's pole to position it around thepasterns, then pulling both pieces of the webbingaway from the animal toward the dorsal aspect sothat it rolls over the dorsum will easily free theanimal. (If there are sufcient personnel to assist,three or four legs may be used.) This is similar to the girth hitch used by many practitioners to tie off ahind leg and prevent kicking during eld surgicalprocedures (Fig. 5). WEB ASSIST ROLL\u2014This method may be useful in entrapment situations (especially slick mud)where it is easier to manipulate webbing under thedownside legs, then pull the legs up and over to rollthe entire animal onto better footing where it canstand. Use one piece of 10-m webbing under allfour legs slightly above the hocks and carpus, andagainst the ground surface. Then the front portionof the strap is fed over the neck, while the backportion is fed over the buttocks of the horse. Work-ing together, at least two persons pull from thedorsal area in a straight line and pull the animalover on its body axis. FORWARD ASSIST\u2014allows the legs to be free so that the horse can use their muscular effort to moveforward, usually to solid ground. There are THREEcongurations of this method: SIMPLE/BASIC, CINCH/LARKSFOOT, and WIDENER/SWISS SEAT.In each case, the webbing that runs in front of theanimal should be kept out of the way of the animal's Fig. 3. Preparing for a Cast Horse Roll using a simple onewebbing looped around the pastern of a mannequin for demon-stration.

The permission assumes that rescuershave assigned an animal handler, who has attachedan emergency rope halter or typical halter to theanimal for guidance and control. It is crucial thatno one pulls on the animals' head during the rescue,or else the animal will ght the assistance effortusing opposition reflex. Once the animal begins tomove forward it will often use its muscular power tomove forward so egress routes should be clearedbefore asking the animal to move forward. SIMPLE/BASIC FORWARD ASSIST (Fig. 6)\u2014 This conguration of the forward assist is the sim-plest to attach and remove, and the easiest to learnto use; however, it is also most subject to slippingand is not appropriate for vertical lift from posteriorrecumbency (out of manholes, etc., where only theforequarters and head are within reach.) A 10-mpiece of webbing is laid over the animal's withers atthe halfway point, then each end of the webbing iswrapped under the chest at the sternum and pulledanteriorly between the legs, then attached with acarabiner to a long rope for manual pulling. CINCH/LARKSFOOT FORWARD ASSIST\u2014This conguration of the forward assist literally cinchesdown around the animal's chest, minimizing thechance of slippage. It is commonly used to tie ananimal off in its current position (on top of a bridgeor trestle for example) so that it cannot fall furtherinto trouble. It is also recommended for verticallifts from posterior recumbency (when a simple ver-tical lift with simple web slings is not possible, orwhen the equipment is not available.) One 10-mpiece of webbing with loops at each end is wrappedaround the animals' chest at the withers, then oneend of the webbing is fed through the loop at theother end, fed anteriorly between the front legs, thenattached with a carabiner to a long rope for manualpulling (Fig. 7). For horses trapped in posterior recumbency (wells, manholes, etc.) the loop of webbing comingfrom between the front legs may be attached to anoverhead lifting point to perform a vertical lift.We are aware of ve occasions of live rescues usingthis method that were very effective. However, weprefer that the rescuer should use the Widener/Swiss Seat method described below because it dou-bles the surface area and ensures the horse'spectoral girdle is locked in and cannot fall out.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 407MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMNote: A variation of this method has been used to lift cattle, elk, moose, and other bovids by usingthe 10-m piece of webbing with loops at each end,wrapped around the animal's chest at the withersand one end of the webbing fed through the loop atthe top of the withers, then attached with a carabi-ner to an overhead crane for a vertical lift. Theauthors are not aware of any successful live rescuesof horses using this method, but it represents aconsideration in situations where there may not beany other option as an attachment point. WIDENER/SWISS SEAT FORWARD ASSIST\u2014 This conguration of the forward assist cinchesaround the animal's entire forequarters and pectoralgirdle, effectively doubling the surface area of thewebbing on the animal's skin, therefore reducing thechance of injury from pressure used to pull the ani-mal out of its entrapment. It also cinches downonto the chest, minimizing slippage. Highly recom-mended for posterior recumbency vertical lifts, thisconguration is slightly more difcult to envelopearound the animal, and does take more time to re-move. However, it does not come off the animal ifproperly emplaced (Fig. 8). One 10-m piece of webbing is held at the animal's chest below the thoracic inlet at the halfway point,then each end of the webbing is wrapped over thewithers, around each side of the animal, down thenunder the chest at the sternum, then pulled anteri-orly between the front legs; lastly, it is fed upthrough the existing webbing at the thoracic inlet;then both looped ends attached with a carabiner to along rope for manual pulling. SIDEWAYS SLIDE\u2014this drag method is useful for minimizing the animal's instinct to struggle byadding pressure to the chest and abdomen whilemoving the animal up or to the side (trench, surfaceice, ditch, flat ground, mud, etc.). There are twocongurations of this method: SIMPLE/BASICand HAMPSHIRE SLIP. Both require two pieces of 5-m-long, 10-cm-wide webbing (10-m length for drafthorses). In both cases it is preferred that the head becontrolled by the animal handler to reduce possibleinjury to the eye or facial paralysis. The weight of theanimals' body is used to the advantage of the rescuersto keep it recumbent, and increases the surface area ofthe animal on the unstable ground surface (mud, etc.)while being moved to safe ground. SIMPLE/BASIC (Fig. 9)\u2014This conguration can be used to pull the animal sideways along theground or on the surface of mud, or upward in amodied vertical lift from surface ice, ditch/trench orpool; or to roll and maneuver the animal into differ-ent positions on the ground (example: for place-ment onto a Rescue Glide). Two pieces of 3-mwebbing are separately flossed under the animal into position (front position) around the abdomen directlybehind the front legs, and (back position) around theabdomen directly in front of the back legs. HAMPSHIRE SLIP (Fig. 10)\u2014This conguration can be used to pull the animal sideways withoutcausing it to roll or struggle out of position. Thismethod has been used in serious mud entrapmentscenarios to move a floundering horse over 200 m tosafe solid ground. Two pieces of 3-m webbing areseparately flossed under the animal into position(front position) around the abdomen directly behindthe front legs, then the top portion of the strap is fedbetween the front legs, under the neck of the animal,and then back to the rescuers at the dorsal aspect ofthe animal; and (back position) around the abdomendirectly in front of the back legs then fed betweenthe back legs, under the tail, and back to the rescu-ers at the dorsal aspect of the animal. BACKWARD DRAG (Fig. 11)\u2014for removing an animal that is recumbent in a trailer or other en-trapment where the only access is to the rear end/posterior of the animal (horse trailer, culvert, etc.)There is only one conguration of this method\u2014a10-m piece of webbing is encircled around the ani-mal's pelvis with the center of the webbing at thedorsum above the spine at the loin. The pieces ofwebbing with loops on the end are fed toward the Fig. 8. Horse in simulated posterior recumbency for training.\u2014webbing has been placed in the Widener/Swiss Seat congurationaround the chest and pectoral girdle to double the surface areaand provide better support to the vertical lift. Note: the headMUST BE SUPPORTED with an overhead attachment point or itwill fall to the side and injure the animal.

This can often be easily effected bythe use of extension poles or canes to move the legswithout harming a rescuer. It is preferred that thehead be controlled by the animal handler to reducepossible injury to the eye or facial paralysis. VERTICAL LIFT is the last option because it usu- ally involves heavy equipment and greater coordina-tion and expense. When considering situationsthat require this method, ensure there is an alter-nate plan if the animal cannot stand on its own afterlifting (Anderson Sling afor long-term support, re - cumbent transport, or euthanasia). Sedation is almost always required, and close coor- dination between the operator of the equipment andthe animal handler. Vertical lifting has been wellcovered in the veterinary literature for a large varietyof simple to complicated slinging equipment a,b,cand methods5,6of horses, but one that is most commonly used by emergency responders and veterinarians intechnical rescue scenarios is the Simple Vertical LiftWeb Sling (Figs. 12 and 13; a commercial versionavailable is the Becker Sling d). Use of 2-m webbing directly behind the front legs supported with a cheststrap across at the thoracic inlet to keep it in place,and another 2 m directly in front of the hind legsensures the animal cannot escape. These webbingsare connected to the spreader bar overhead with theprussick attachments, then the spreader bar is con-nected to the tractor/backhoe or chain hoist for lifting. Benets of Simple Vertical Lift Web Slings include equipment that is simple to employ, cheap to acquire,and the practical use of the Simple Vertical Lift sys-tems has been shown in numerous situations. Thetechnique makes the animal feel trapped and usuallycauses the horse to sulk or hang quietly during thelifting procedure due to the physical sedative effect,minimizing risk to itself and others. A concern with implementing the Vertical Lift Sling is that personnel must be trained in its use tomaximize safety when working around a trapped orrecumbent, frightened animal to prevent beingkicked or crushed. Initial sedation or light anes-thesia of the animal is essential to allow the animalto be placed in the sling and to prevent it fromstruggling and injuring itself or the rescuers. Lastly, vertical lift systems visually appear to place signicant pressure on the abdominal area ofthe animal; however, abdominal, thoracic, and pul-monary perfusions have not been observed to besignicantly impaired in rescued animals lifted inthis manner for 2-12 min ( /H1102220-min lifts in training scenarios with demonstration animals over 200training evolutions). Pregnant mares have beensuccessfully lifted using this technique. Contactpressure is minimized when using wider straps forthe lift because they increase the surface area of thecontact points on the animal. When used in con- Fig. 9.

RESCUE GLIDE SYSTEMS\u2014Horses are notori- ously difcult to move or transport when sternally orlaterally recumbent. Their tendency to thrash inan attempt to stand can lead to further injury.There is little information in the literature provid-ing viable solutions to this problem. Attempts byearly practitioners to use low-wheeled tables, tarps,or simple plywood for this purpose were impracticalor unprofessional in the eld, at shows, in the clinic,and on racetracks. 7 The L.A.R.G.E. Rescue Glidee, Resquip Systemf, CDA Products Rescue Glideg, andLARRCO Rescue Glidehall provide practical means of moving a recumbent, nonambulatory horse.

These skeds have specialty access points,rachet or webbing tie-down anchor straps, and metalattachment points for loading into an equine ambu-lance. A horse must usually be sedated during trans-port on these skeds to prevent further injury to itself orpersonnel. Use of Rescue Glide systems in both med-ical emergencies and technical rescues of trapped an-imals has been extremely successful for transport ofhorses with severe tendon lacerations, neurologic in-juries or diseases, broken pelvises and extremities, orshock, to veterinary facilities. 3. Results Collecting the actual number of recumbence eventsis impossible because it is such a common part ofclinical practice, and prevents documentation of thesuccess rate of using these methods. A literaturesearch revealed a small pool of information aboutmethods of moving horses that are recumbent, andan inconsequential amount of research into physio-logic responses to these methods. Collection of an-ecdotal information on recumbent horses by thepermission has revealed that numerous incidentsoccur; however, the reporting subject often does nothave access to or receive the details that are mostimportant to disaster scientists, technical rescue re-searchers, or veterinary epidemiologists. Manipu-lation methods training is not currently a part of thestudent curriculum of veterinary schools or veteri-nary technician programs, but could be extremelyhelpful to reduce injuries to employees and studentsassisting with horses in these situations, particu-larly to reduce work-related exposure to injuries.(These techniques work equally well on bovine,caprine, porcine, llamoid, and large exotics with mi-nor modications for behavior and anatomy.)Much knowledge of how horses may be manipu- lated, and suggestions for better response proce-dures, come from a combination of knowledgeableveterinarians, horsewomen/men, actual accountsand photos/videos, and reports police,animal control and sheriff's ofcers) that have re-sponded to these incidents. For example, whenpressure is applied on the chest and abdomen of ahorse, it causes a physiological response that mini-mizes effort to struggle, resulting in a lessened abilityof the animal to get up, especially if the head is man-aged well by the animal handler. This physical sed-ative effect has been utilized by farriers, veterinarians,and horsemen throughout history to cause horses tobecome quiescent for various procedures. During the last 25 years much of the research and development of these procedures and methods hasbeen documented by colleagues in large-animal andtechnical emergency rescue, not within the veteri-nary community. The authors' experiences provid-ing student training in Technical Large AnimalEmergency Rescue with practitioners, veterinarytechnicians, re/rescue professionals, animal con-trol, and law enforcement ofcers have demon-strated that many people are assumed to know\u2014butactually do not know\u2014how to help a recumbent horsein an emergency situation without putting themselvesor the animal at risk. Fallacies related to recumbentanimal response and poor understanding of correctmethodologies in the general equine industry havegrown out of the lack of scientic rigor available. 4. Discussion Recumbent horses are very dangerous to manipulate.Injuries sustained by practitioners, their staff and cli-ents (well-intentioned rescuers) on scene can have de-bilitating long-term effects on health, safety, andwellness of people. Slides, drags, vertical lifts, andassists are basic to technical large-animal emergencyrescue\u2014a specialty form of heavy rescue in the Fireand Rescue Services that is intimately tied to the vet-erinary practitioner's expertise and advice. Past useof methods such as pulling on the head, tail, or feetwithout relieving pressure points reflect our predatory human instincts to solve the problem\u2014but have caused iatrogenic injury in the equine victim (traumaticamputations, lacerations, asphyxiation, age, myopathy, neurologic injury, etc.). When em-placing webbing or slings, extensions of the armshould be used, and before pulling proper personnelpositioning should be considered to get the correctangle to effect rescue. Many animals, when manipulated out of the en- trapment or enabled to roll to sternal will rise andstand on their own; thus, facilitating self rescue isthe best use of manipulations methods (Fig. 15).It prevents the practitioner from having to use morecomplicated slings or methods to effect extrication orrescue. Horses in emergency or clinical recum-bence scenarios may have special medical concerns Fig. 14.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 411MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMsuch as severe injuries, stress, hyper- or hypother-mia, dehydration, shock, and exhaustion. Coordi-nation between the veterinarian and the responseteam is important to increase the efciency of treat-ment on scene, facilitate the extrication and allow vet-erinary medical attention to be administered. Theincreased chance of shock when combining sedationwith rescues is because the veterinarian may not benotied or physically able to arrive to treat the animaluntil several hours after the incident occurs. Some animals in recumbency will need to be ag- gressively treated or euthanized based on the extentof their internal or external injuries\u2014this is wherethe crucial involvement and advice of the attendingveterinarian is mandatory. The use of sedationshould be carefully evaluated when recumbence sce-narios occur in wet or muddy environments, becausethe sedated horse could drown or cause physiologicthermal maintenance issues. Large animals when recumbent represent a challenge to extricate from the numerous and common entrap-ments that they occur in. However, procedures used tosafely and simply remove the animal from the situationrequire use of simple webbing, extension/reach tools foremplacement of webbing or slings, helmet for the han-dler and operational personnel, a halter for guidance andcontrol by the animal handler, and coordination of per-sonnel to pull or manipulate the animal. By success-fully manipulating the body of the horse, the responderscan encourage the animal to self rescue where possible,and minimize iatrogenic injury to the animal victim.The suggested methods provide a more professional,safe, and efcient response to horses that are recum- bent due to being geriatric, debilitated, injured, or indaily clinical situations or as part of a technical rescueresponse scenario. With emphasis on the use of sim-ple tools, appropriate protective equipment for person-nel (i.e., helmets), looped-end webbing, equipment,and proper positioning of personnel, the practitionerand their staff can achieve safer and more effectiveresults when moving recumbent (live or dead) horsesin various situations commonly encountered in thepractitioner's daily work.Acknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Authors have adhered to the Principles of Veter-inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Authors have no conflicts of interest.

AAEP. Introduction Identication of a cardiac arrhythmia in the horsecan be a confusing and sometimes startling nding.Certain cardiac arrhythmias, such as second-degreeatrioventricular block, might be recognizable basedon auscultation alone. Many other rhythm irregu-larities, however, are impossible to decipher withonly a stethoscope. In any scenario, an abnormalcardiac rhythm can trick even seasoned clinicians.Thorough physical examination and careful cardiacauscultation can aid a practitioner in determiningcardiovascular stability and signicance of a cardiacarrhythmia. However, electrocardiography is the most appropriate means to conrm or achieve arhythm diagnosis and should be employed whenevera cardiac arrhythmia is appreciated. Despite the obvious benets of performing electro- cardiography, rhythm diagnosis can be difcult toachieve in an ambulatory setting. Portable electro-cardiography machines occupy valuable truck space,often require electricity, and are hampered by tangledwires. Because indications for electrocardiographydo not occur daily and are frequently unforeseen,veterinarians in the eld are often caught in scenar-ios in which access to this diagnostic tool would behelpful but would require an additional farm calland additional time that can be difcult to justify.The introduction of the AliveCor Veterinary Heart Monitor a, a handheld wireless portable electrocardi- ography device, has helped to circumvent some ofthe obstacles that hinder the equine ambulatoryveterinarian's routine access to electrocardiography.This device can be used to capture a reliable electro-cardiographic tracing that will, in many instances,allow for cardiac rhythm diagnosis to be performedin the eld. 2. Materials and Methods The AliveCor Veterinary Heart Monitor can be pur-chased online through specic distributors. At thetime of publication, the AliveCor Web site only dis-tributes its newer Kardia Mobile model. Unlike theVeterinary Heart Monitor, Kardia Mobile has not beenvalidated for veterinary use. Before using the Veter-inary Heart Monitor, it is necessary to download thedevice's corresponding application onto a smartphone(Fig. 1). Most platforms require creation of a user-name and password; this helps to maintain a catalog ofa user's recorded electrocardiograms. The heart monitors are effectively smartphone cases; they t appropriately onto the phone modelfor which they are compatible. If a standard smart-phone case is already in place, it is not mandatory toremove that case and replace it with the heart mon- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 413MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEM NOTESitor case. Most heart monitors can transmit a sig-nal to the smartphone as long as they are in physicalcontact, even across a standard smartphone case(Fig. 2). After auscultating the horse's heart, open the ap- plication on the smartphone. With the VeterinaryHeart Monitor in contact with the smartphone, ap-ply the electrodes of the device to the horse's skin.Amplitude of the electrocardiogram can be adjustedmanually; importantly the amplitude of the tracingis also directly related to the proximity of the mon-itor to the horse's heart. As such, the device is mostappropriately applied to the left cranioventral tho-rax near the fth intercostal space. Once contactwith the horse's skin is established, the smartphoneapplication should begin recording the electrocardio-gram (single lead). If a tracing does not register,apply 70% isopropyl alcohol to the skin and place theVeterinary Heart Monitor on the skin (Fig. 3). Duration of the recording is preset (typically 30 to 60 seconds) within the application and can be ad-justed on the application's settings menu. At theconclusion of the recording period, the entire tracingcan be reviewed in the application (Fig. 4). The Fig. 1. Screenshots from iPhone 5SbApp Store to purchase AliveCor apps. Fig. 2.

Application of isopropyl alcohol and veterinary HeartMonitor HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMelectrocardiogram can also be immediately exportedand/or emailed as a PDF le (Fig. 4). In the author's opinion, the recorded electrocar- diogram is best reviewed in PDF format. Once aclear tracing has been obtained it is ready to beanalyzed. The rst step in a systematic approachto electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is to mea-sure the heart rate. The AliveCor application iscapable of calculating the heart rate; this should becompared with ndings from cardiac auscultation.Each dot on the electrocardiogram marks 1 mm.Each small box is 5 mm across; each large box is 25mm across. If the paper speed of the electrocardio-gram is 25 mm/s, each large box represent s 1 s (Fig. 5). The number of QRS complexes in six consecu-tive large boxes should be counted and multiplied by10 to estimate a heart rate. Once heart rate is veried, cardiac rhythm should be categorized as regular or irregular. To objec-tively determine this, the R-R interval should beidentied (distance between the peaks of QRS com-plexes) (Fig. 6). Whenever possible, calipers shouldbe used to measure each R-R interval as even subtleirregularities may be present but not apparent tothe naked eye. If R-R interval is consistent, cardiacrhythm is considered regular. The most frequentlyidentied regular cardiac rhythms in equine medicineinclude normal sinus rhythm, sinus tachycardia, su-praventricular tachycardia, and isoform ventriculartachycardia. If R-R interval has any irregularities,cardiac rhythm is considered irregular. The most fre-quently identied irregular cardiac rhythms in equinemedicine include premature complexes, ventricular prematurecomplexes, and multiform ventricular tachycardia. Next the electrocardiogram should be evaluated for the presence of P waves, QRS complexes, and Twaves (Fig. 7). In normal sinus rhythm, every Pwave is associated with a QRS complex and everyQRS complex is associated wit h a P wave (Fig. 8). P waves (atrial depolarization) that are not associ-ated with QRS complexes (ventricular depolarization) represent some form of atrioventricular block. QRScomplexes that are not associated with P waves rep-resent some form of junctional (arising from the atrio-ventricular node) or ventricular ectopy. Importantly,it is physiologically impossible fo r a T wave (ventricu- lar repolarization) to be present without a precedingQRS complex; this concept can be helpful when inter-preting complicated electrocardiograms. The electrocardiogram must also be evaluated for P wave, QRS complex, and T wave morphology.The three primary components of wave morphologyinclude polarity (positive or negative), amplitude(height), and duration (width). Among P waves,QRS complexes, and T waves, QRS complex mor-phology is arguably the most variable and clinicallyrelevant in ECG interpretation in equine medicine. Fig. 4.

PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 415MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMIn normal sinus rhythm, QRS complexes should not only be paired with P waves but must be mor-phologically similar with respect to polarity, ampli-tude, and duration. Normal QRS complexes arisefrom the atrioventricular node and are conductedrapidly; as such these complexes are narrower thanQRS complexes that arise from elsewhere in theventricular myocardium. Ectopic ventricular beatsare wider and are not preceded by P waves. Asingle ectopic ventricular beat is designated as ventriculartachycardia refers to multiple consecutive ventricu-lar beats that all have identical QRS morphology.Multiform ventricular tachycardia refers to multipleconsecutive ventricular beats that are of differentQRS morphologies. The reader is directed to thereference below for a more extensive discussion ofECG interpretation. 1 3. Results A recent study suggested that intra-observer agree-ment for rhythm assessment was very high whenequine patients were evaluated using the AliveCorVeterinary Heart Monitor. 2In this study, electro -cardiography was performed on twenty horses usingboth the Veterinary Heart Monitor and a referenceelectrocardiography machine (base-apex lead). In-stantaneous and average heart rates were withinone beat in all horses when calculated. There wasno disagreement with rhythm diagnosis between thetwo machines in any of the horses that were evalu-ated. As previously mentioned, AliveCor KardiaMobile has not yet been validated in veterinary spe-cies. Although the Veterinary Heart Monitor seems to be a reliable assessor of cardiac rhythm, it is onlycapable of recording a single lead and might overlooksubtle electrocardiographic disturbances that wouldbe detected by machines that measure on six or 12leads. Regardless, in practice the Veterinary HeartMonitor can aid in the diagnosis of many equine car-diac arrhythmias. Of these arrhythmias, second-degree atrioventric- ular block is probably the most common in horses.It is associated with high vagal tone and shoulddisappear with exercise and/or sympathetic stimu-lation. This rhythm is characterized by a consis-tent R-R interval. Occasionally a beat is \"dropped,\"meanin g a P wave occurs with no successive QRS complex (Fig. 9). The distance between the preced-ing QRS complex and subsequent QRS complex Fig. 8. PDF layout of an AliveCor electrocardiogram in a horse in normal sinus rhythm. P wave, QRS complex, and T wave areidentied. Fig. 9. AliveCor electrocardiogram in a horse with block. /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICAL THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMshould be exactly twice as long as the other R-Rintervals. Infrequently two consecutive droppedbeats may occur normally; three or more consecutivedropped beats are not normal. Second-degreeatrioventricular block is not pathologic in horses anddoes not warrant treatment. Third-degree atrioventricular block is very uncom- mon in horses and might occur due to degenerative orinflammatory changes in the atrioventricular node. As such, multiple P waves will be observed withoutassociated QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram(Fig. 10). QRS complexes that are observed mayhave been conducted through the atrioventricularnode or may be \"escape\" beats. This arrhythmiamay precipitate signs of collapse in affected horsesand should prompt consultation with an internalmedicine specialist or cardiologist. Atrial brillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia in horses. It might be \"lone\" (occurring with noapparent underlying cause) or it might occur due toleft characterized an irreg-ularly irregular rhythm; the R-R interval is neverconsistent (Fig. 11). Importantly, no P waves arepresent. P waves are replaced by 'f' (brillation)waves in in the author's are difcult to identify with the Alive-Cor Veterinary Heart Monitor. The absence of Pwaves and the presence of an irregularly irregularrhythm is consistent with a diagnosis of atrial bril-lation. Although not an emergency, atrial brilla-tion that persists for longer than 24 to 48 hoursshould prompt consultation with an internal medi-cine specialist or cardiologist. Atrial brillationmight represent structural heart disease, especiallyif it is associated with a cardiac murmur. Echocar-diography is indicated in these cases. Atrial bril-lation can possibly be corrected by treatment withquinidine or by transvenous electrical cardioversion. Sinus tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia are indistinguishable on cardiac auscultation. Electro-cardiography is the primary means of differentiat-ing these two rhythms and is a helpful diagnostictool in horses with sustained tachycardia (Figs. 12and 13). Isoform ventricular tachycardia is charac- Fig. 10. AliveCor electrocardiogram in a horse with third-degree atrioventricular block. Fig. 11.

QRS complexes are wider butwidth and polarity should be consistent from beat tobeat (Fig. 12). QRS complexes that vary in widthand polarity from beat to beat more likely representa multiform ventricular tachycardia.Rapid ventricular rhythms failure and/or arrest. Identication of aventricular rhythm may warrant immediate treat-ment and, if needed, should prompt consultation witha consulting veterinarian or cardiologist. Sinus tachycardia is also characterized by a reg- ular R-R interval. The presence of P waves andnarrow QRS complexes differentiates this rhythmfrom ventricular tachycardia (Fig. 13). Lastly, changes in electrocardiographic morphol- ogy may be related to the Veterinary Heart Monitoritself. Polarity of all electrocardiographic waves isinverted by rotating the Veterinary Heart Monitor180\u00b0. Width (duration) of electrocardiographicwaves is not affected by position of the VeterinaryHeart Monitor and will only be influenced by paperspeed. Amplitude of all electrocardiographic wavesincreases as distance between the Veterinary HeartMonitor and the heart decreases. The QRS ampli-tude tends to be greater in foals and smaller horses,probably because of their smaller body size. In theelectrocardiogram in Figure 14, note irregular R-Rintervals that are consistent with a rhythm diagno-sis of atrial brillation. 4. Discussion The use of the AliveCor Veterinary Heart Monitor isa reliable means of establishing cardiac rhythm di-agnosis in the eld and is a helpful component to acomplete cardiovascular examination. The Veteri-nary Heart Monitor's ability to create electrocardio-graphic tracings with a smartphone in an ambulatorysetting facilitates immediate consultation with col-leagues. Moreover, the apparatus is small, afford-able, and can be purchased readily online. Althoughthe device can only provide electrocardiographic trac-ings in a single-lead format, it offers substantiallymore information to the ambulatory veterinarian whois equipped with simply a stethoscope. The AliveCorVeterinary Heart Monitor provides a new dimensionto cardiac evaluation in an ambulatory setting and caninfluence decisions to properly treat and/or refer af-fected patients.

FIND AND TREAT THEMHow to Perform Abdominocentesis UsingOne-Handed Sterile Technique and Field Jean-Yin Tan, DVM, DACVIM-LA Author's address: University of Calgary Faculty of Veterinary decision to euthanize a horse with aruptured gastrointestinal tract to diagnosing uro-peritoneum in a foal, abdominocentesis is a valuablecomponent of the complete examination of the abdo-men. Abdominocentesis can be used as a) part ofthe acute abdominal diagnostic work-up to assess forintestinal compromise and indications for surgery oreuthanasia, b) as a diagnostic tool to differentiate peri-tonitis, neoplasia, and abdominal abscesses in horseswith complaints such as chronic weight loss, and c) todiagnose hemoperitoneum or uroperitoneum in adultand neonatal patients. Despite its obvious benets to case management, equine practitioners may be reluctant to performabdominocentesis in the eld due to several limita-tions, including safety, inability to maintain a clean oraseptic environment, limited access to skilled helpers,and inability to interpret results in the eld. This paper describes the use of a one-handed ster- ile technique to perform abdominocentesis asepti-cally and easily in an ambulatory setting with simply a handler and a veterinarian present. Thispaper will also discuss how to form a \"eld diagnosis\"based on gross characteristics of peritoneal fluid.2. Materials and MethodsConsiderations CleanlinessIdeally, abdominocentesis is performed in a dust-free and clean environment to decrease the possibil-ity of contamination. The horse should be removedfrom the stall and the procedure performed in thecleanest area of the barn, with ample space for theveterinarian and handler to work safely. In manybarns, this may be the wash stall or a groomingstall.SafetyThere are many advantages to performing techni-cally challenging or invasive procedures in the hos-pital setting. The availability of skilled personnelwho can handle the horse is one of those advantages.Abdominocentesis should only be performed in theeld if the veterinarian feels that with the horsesedated and restrained that the handler is suf-ciently capable of keeping both horse and veteri-narian safe. Besides sedation, skin twitches, liptwitches, nose chains, and other distraction tech-niques be helpful. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 419MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEM NOTESSupplies This paper will focus on abdominocentesis using ateat cannula. Advantages of the teat cannula in- clude the blunt end, which may decrease the risk ofinadvertent enterocentesis, and the larger bore, whichallows greater chance of peritoneal fluid retrieval.However, the same procedure may be adapted for useof the bitch catheter, 18-gauge /H110031.5-inch needle, and 18-gauge /H110033.5-inch spinal needle. The following supplies are gathered prior to be- ginning the procedure: Table (in the absence of a table, a tack trunk, straw bale, bag of shavings, grain bin, or gar-bage can with lid flipped over and blue towelplaced on top may sufce) Chemical and physical restraint (the author typically uses 0.01 mg/kg detomidine IV and anose twitch on the average-size horse) Materials for Sterile 4 /H110034-inch gauze tube Serum clot tube /H11006heparin tube Preparation Once the materials have been gathered, EDTAshould be shaken out of the EDTA tube. When lessthan 2 mL of peritoneal fluid is obtained, the EDTAcan excessively dilute the sample by falsely decreas-ing cell counts, and can also falsely elevate totalprotein levels. 1,2,3 A site is selected for abdominocentesis at the most dependent portion of the abdomen for a greater like-lihood of fluid accumulation, and to the right ofmidline to avoid the spleen and to avoid the surgicalsite if the horse undergoes a laparotomy. 1This is typically 5 cm caudal to the xiphoid process and 2 cmto the right of the median raphe. 4This site is also easily recognizable by its location within a triangleformed by the insertion of the deep pectoral muscle,the ventral midline, and an imaginary line drawnfrom caudal aspect of the pectoral muscleto the midline (Figs. 1 and 2). The following steps may be followed in prepara- tion for the procedure: 1. Sedate the horse and apply a distraction technique if desired. 2. Clip the selected site for abdominocentesis and gather materials on the table (Fig. 3).3. Prepare the site with sterile scrub. The au- thor scrubs the area using 4 /H110034-inch gauze sponges soaked in 2% chlorhexidine or 1%betadine scrub, followed with 4 /H110034-inch gauze sponges soaked in sterile saline (if chlorhexidine is used) or alcohol (if betadineis used). 4. Before gloving, loosen the caps of the EDTA and serum clot tube so they can be easilyremoved using one hand. 5. Open sterile gloves on the previously prepared table to create a sterile eld for working. 6. Open the 3-cc syringe, 6-cc syringe, sterile No. 15 blade, sterile teat cannula, and sterile4/H110034-inch gauze sponge onto the sterile eld created by the packaging for the sterile gloves(Fig. 4). 7. Using open-gloving technique, don a sterile glove onto the dominant hand (Fig. 5). 8. Prepare the teat cannula by using the gloved hand to thread the teat cannulathrough the single 4 /H110034-inch gauze sponge (Fig. 6). The gauze will serve to soak up Fig. 1. The horse's abdomen is clipped to center around the siteof abdominocentesis. In this image, the median raphe is beingtraced. The approach would be caudal to the xiphoid process, tothe right of midline. Fig. 2. The \"triangle\" formed by the deep pectoral muscle, mid-line, and imaginary line from caudal extent of the muscle to themedian raphe are outlined. The procedure can be performed atany site within this triangle. 420 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMblood and prevent contamination of theperitoneal fluid sample. There is a palpa-ble and audible \"pop\" as the cannula pops through the gauze. This sensation is similarto the \"pop\" felt when the peritoneum is en-tered during abdominocentesis. 9. Holding the sterile 3-cc syringe using the sterile gloved hand, attach the 25-gauge nee-dle using the ungloved hand. 10. Using the ungloved hand to hold the bottle of 2% lidocaine (or 2% mepivacaine) upsidedown, use the gloved hand and sterile 3-ccsyringe and 25-gauge needle to withdraw 3cc of lidocaine (Fig. 7). Technique 11. Standing on the right side of the horse as closely as possible to the forelimbs for safety,select a site for abdominocentesis within thearea that has been aseptically prepped. Se-lect a site that has no supercial bloodvessels. 12. Let the handler know that the horse is about to receive an injection. Inject the lidocainesubcutaneously until a visible bleb forms(approximately 1 mL), then direct the needleperpendicularly through the site to block themuscle. Inject approximately 2 mL as theneedle is withdrawn, to block the entire areathat the teat cannula will advance through(Fig. 8). 13. Using the gloved hand, pick up the No. 15 blade and the sterile teat cannula with 4 /H11003 4-inch gauze threaded through. Use thethumb and forenger to hold the blade and Fig. 3.

Using the unglovedhand, pick up the EDTA and serum clottubes. Hold them at an angle such that thecaps can be removed by gently removing ontothe table (Fig. 9). 14. Let the handler know that you are about to begin the procedure. Holding the No. 15blade between the thumb and forengerwhere the shank meets the blade, make avertical stab incision through the lidocainebleb, to the depth of the sharpened blade(Fig. 10). This will allow easier passage ofthe blunt teat cannula. The No. 15 bladecan be disposed of. 15. Push the teat cannula vertically through the muscle of the belly wall using gentle upwardpressure, taking care to hold it closer towardthe tip so that it cannot be accidentally ad-vanced too quickly. There are two points of resistance felt as the abdomen is en-tered: one point as the teat cannula ad-vances through the body wall, then a point ofresistance before there is a \"pop\" sensa-tion. This corresponds to the loss of resis-tance as a teat cannula enters the abdomen(Fig. 11). 16. Use the ungloved nondominant hand to catch peritoneal fluid as it drips out (Fig.12). Collect samples in the EDTA tube (andheparin tube, if used) before the serum clottube, given that the fluid can be analyzedfrom the EDTA tube while culture and sen-sitivity analyses are less often performed us- Fig. 7.

When the procedure is complete, usea swift downward motion to remove thecannula. Troubleshooting The author has performed abdominocentesis usingthe one-handed sterile technique extensively withno adverse effects. As depicted below (Fig. 13), there are a variety of strategies that may be employed when no fluid isobtained during abdominocentesis. First, evaluatethe size and body condition of the horse. If thehorse has thick retroperitoneal fat layers, a spinalneedle or bitch catheter of longer length may need tobe used. If the teat cannula seems to be the correctlength for the size horse, the tip of the teat cannulamay be pushed against the omentum inside the peri-toneal cavity. Flicking or twirling the end of theteat cannula or using the 6-cc sterile syringe to pushin 5 cc of air can serve to \"blow\" the omentum off thetip. This step also conrms entrance through theperitoneum. If the cannula is outside of the perito-neal lining, the air will be expelled. If the cannulais inside the peritoneal cavity, the air will be re-tained. If these steps do not result in fluid recov-ery, a second teat cannula or 18-gauge /H110031.5-inch needle may be placed immediately caudal to the rstteat cannula. This will help to overcome the nega-tive pressure in the abdomen. 2Pushing gently on the side of the horse may also allow more flow ofperitoneal fluid. 2If no fluid is obtained after these techniques are employed, abdominocentesis may berepeated at a different time after rehydration withIV fluids if the horse is dehydrated. Note that nor-mal horses with normal amounts of peritoneal fluidmay not yield a sample on abdominocentesis. 3 Occasionally, splenic puncture may contaminate a peritoneal fluid sample. Gross characteristics canaid with a eld diagnosis. For example, a splenictap tends to yield a dark red opaque color and tur-bidity, small volume of blood, and ability to clotwhen settled out, as compared with peritoneal fluidand true hemorrhagic effusion. 3When a centrifuge and refractometer are available, splenocentesis maybe differentiated from blood contamination andhemorrhage through centrifugation, the identica-tion of platelets (as compared with erythrophagocy-tosis), and comparison of packed cell volume (PCV)as depicted below 2,3(Figs. 13 and 14 ): When PCV /H11022peripheral PCV, the peritoneal fluid likely reflects a splenic tap When PCV /H11005peripheral PCV, the peritoneal fluid likely reflects blood contamination When PCV /H11021peripheral PCV, the peritoneal fluid likely reflects hemoperitoneum As an invasive procedure, abdominocentesis may beassociated with other adverse events. For exam-ple, contamination during the procedure may resultin cellulitis of the abdominal wall. This may betreated using a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics.In addition, omental herniation may occur, espe-cially in young foals. This may be treated by re-moving the omentum just as it exits the body wall.Enterocentesis can be treated using a 3- to 5-daycourse of antibiotics. This can be differentiatedfrom a rupture through systemic clinical signs andthe absence of neutrophils on cytology (Fig. 13). 3. Results One of the limitations of performing abdominocen-tesis in the eld is the lack of resources for labora-tory analysis. However, the author has been ableto gain diagnostic and prognostic information fromgross characteristics of peritoneal fluid and labora-tory parameters that may be measured in the eldusing portable equipment. Fig. 11. The teat cannula is advanced through the peritoneallining using the gloved hand. Fig. 12. The peritoneal fluid sample is collected using tubes heldin the ungloved nondominant hand. HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMThe rst parameter that may be evaluated in the eld is volume of peritoneal fluid collected.When greater than 100 mL of fluid is collected,this may suggest the presence of effusion or in-creased abdominal pressure from intestinaldistention. 3,5 Together with volume, the color and clarity of peritoneal fluid can lead to a eld diagnosis (Fig. 15), Fig. 13. Techniques used for troubleshooting abdominocentesis. Note that some of these techniques may require further laboratoryanalysis, beyond what is available in the eld. Fig. 14. Gross characteristics of peritoneal fluid leading to a eld diagnosis.3 424 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMallowing an ambulatory practitioner to make diag-nostic and prognostic decisions. During intestinalcompromise, duration and severity are reflected inturbidity (increasing turbidity suggests increasingcellularity or protein levels) and color (reflecting thetype of cells present). 2,5Normal peritoneal fluid is light yellow (color of straw) and clear. During therst 2 hours of compromise, total protein increases,causing an increase in the intensity of the yellowcolor. Red blood cells begin to leak in the rst 4hours, resulting in a serosanguinous color, and after6 hours of compromise, white blood cells increaseduring intestinal necrosis. 1Particulate matter in the fluid may represent brin from inflamma-tion and plant material from enterocentesis orrupture. Peritoneal fluid color correlates withprognosis for survival, with the dark red color(color of port wine) suggesting tissue ischemia andnecrosis and being associated with strangulatinglesions and nonsurvival. 3,6 By allowing peritoneal fluid to sediment by grav- ity in the eld, a rough estimate can be made of thecellularity of the fluid. The height of the sedimentis generally proportional to the cellularity, and dif-ferent colors correlate with the ratio of red bloodcells and nucleated cells. 3 Further information to conrm a eld diagnosis can be obtained using small portable equipment such as a refractometer, glucometer, or lactate me-ter. Normal peritoneal fluid has a total protein ofless than 2.5 g/dL and protein increases with in-testinal compromise. 3,5For example, horses with septic peritonitis yield total protein levels of greaterthan 3 g/dL. 5They also yield glucose levels lower than that of peripheral blood, often exhibiting glu-cose concentrations of less than 40 mg/dL. 3Perito - neal lactate should be less than 2 mmol/L and ifgreater than peripheral lactate, can indicate intes-tinal compromise and ischemia. Peritoneal lactateof/H110229.4 mmol/L has been correlated with no chance of survival. 6In cases of sepsis, a peritoneal sample in a serum clot tube can be saved for culture andsensitivity. Some cases may be more complex due to ambigu- ous results, results that conflict with the clinicalpicture, compartmentalization of severe disease, or Fig. 15. Ancillary diagnostics performed in a reference laboratory can be used to further characterize peritoneal fluid after apresumptive diagnosis achieved in the eld. 3,4 AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 425MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMvalues may be within reference range due to earlydetection of severe intestinal compromise. 2In these cases, further information may be garneredthrough laboratory analysis, including nucleatedcell count and cytology. The nucleated cell count ofnormal fluid is 5000 cells/ /H9262L3and septic peritonitis may yield cell counts of upward of 20,000 cells/ /H9262L5. Furthermore, creatinine can be measured and whengreater than twice systemic creatinine, can indicateuroperitoneum. 7Although cell count and cytology cannot typically be performed in the eld, a refer-ence is provided (Fig. 15) for further diagnostics thatmay occur if the samples can be submitted to alaboratory. 4. Discussion Many equine ambulatory practitioners hesitate toperform abdominocentesis in the eld due to inabil-ity to maintain aseptic technique, concerns aboutnumber of people present, and the perception thatlimited information can be gained from the perito-neal fluid in the eld. The author has performed numerous abdomino- centesis procedures in the eld with no reportedinstances of cellulitis, infection, or swelling. The au-thor chooses locations within the barn that are the most dust free, such as a matted wash stall, and theuse of the one-handed sterile technique eliminatesthe need for an assistant. Using this technique, theprocedure can be performed with simply a handlerpresent, while preserving aseptic technique. The author has been able to use the physical char- acteristics of peritoneal fluid to guide treatment de-cisions in the eld, without access to laboratoryequipment. Decisions for surgical referral and eu-thanasia decisions have been made promptly basedon peritoneal fluid volume, color, clarity, and sedi-mentation by gravity. In the author's experience,eld diagnoses have correlated well with resultsfrom surgery and post-mortem examination. However, cases are not always straightforward, and as a horse's clinical signs progress during asevere colic episode, the character of the peritonealfluid may change as well. Field diagnostics are lim-ited in the early detection of severe disease. Inthese cases, access to laboratory equipment to ana-lyze protein levels, cell counts, and cytology can bemost valuable. When clinical signs are more severethan eld assessment of the character of peritonealfluid, the author relies more heavily on the clinicalsigns of the patient and when referral to a facility isavailable, this recommendation is made. Despitethese limitations for specic cases, collection andinterpretation of peritoneal fluid in the eld is in-valuable for the vast majority of horses who presentwith colic and chronic weight loss. 5. Conclusion In summary, abdominocentesis can be performedsafely, efciently, and aseptically in the eld usingthe one-handed sterile technique and the assistanceof only a handler. Using gross visual characteris-tics and minimal portable equipment to evaluate theperitoneal fluid, a general equine ambulatory veter-inarian can arrive at a eld diagnosis and makeinformed decisions, from the surgical referral of ahorse with compromised intestine to a euthanasiadecision on a horse with a ruptured gastrointestinaltract.

Prevalence and Risk Factors Prevalence of EGGD is variable, depending uponbreed and discipline of horse. Interpretation of prev-alence is confounded by the fact that different studiesreport prevalence including any type or severity ofglandular disease, and other studies report only grade2 or greater. Prevalence of glandular disease rangefrom 10% to 65%. 2-8Higher prevalence of EGGD with EGGDgrade/H113502 of 46% to 65%. 4,6A recent study suggested that Warmbloods are at increased likelihood for gas-tric glandular disease compared with other breeds. 9 In that study, the only other variable associated withincreased likelihood of EGGD was increasing numberof caretakers. 9In increased glandular gas-tric disease. 4In Thoroughbred racehorses, factors identied as associated with increased likelihood ofEGGD include sex, trainer, direct contact betweenhorses, absence of grass turnout, being fed unpro-cessed grain, not being fed haylage, and decreasingdays spent exercising at a high intensity, andswimming. 10 Pathophysiology: Naturally Occurring Disease There is limited information on the pathophysiologyof gastric glandular disease. In squamous disease,increased exposure to hydrochloric acid has beenproposed to contribute to lesion formation. How- ever, given that the glandular mucosa is continu-ously exposed to hydrochloric acid, it is more likelythat breakdown of normal mucosal barriers is pri-marily responsible for initiation of lesion formationrather than exposure to acid alone.Glandular mucosal blood flowand mucous secretion. In other species, prosta-glandins have been demonstrated to be key tomucosal defense. In humans, Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastritis and gastric ulcers. Several studies in AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 427MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEM NOTEShorses have investigated the role of Helicobacter spp. in formation of gastric ulcers and/or gastritisin horses. One study demonstrated that 90% ofhorses with gastric lesions had Helicobacter-likeDNA, whereas 39% of horses without gastric lesionshad Helicobacter-like DNA. 11However, lesions of affected horses were not stratied by location (squa-mous versus glandular). Administration of Helico- bacter equorum to a small number (n /H110054) of healthy horses did not lead to gastric colonization. 12Helico - bacter pylori DNA was isolated from the glandular mucosa of 3/8 horses with grade 4 glandular disease,and in 0/5 horses with grade 1 to 2 EGGD and 0/9horses with normal glandular mucosa. 13H.equorum was not identied in 10 horses, including ve withgrade 4 glandular disease. 13The role of Helicobacter spp. in gastric glandular disease remains unclear. To date, there has been one study evaluating the histologic appearance of glandular lesions.This study demonstrated that most horses withglandular disease have histological evidence ofgastritis. 14 Pathophysiology: NonsteroidalAnti-Inflammatory-Induced Lesions Administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory(NSAID) drugs can induce lesions of the stomachwhich are primarily, but not exclusively, glandularin location. 15-19Although gastric ulcers in other species are primarily associated with inhibition ofprostaglandin synthesis, other mechanisms maycontribute mucosal barrier,21,22 and topical cytotoxicity.23Furthermore, the one study performed to date in horses suggest that de-creased glandular prostaglandin E (PGE) or prosta-glandin I (PGI) concentrations are not associatedwith formation of glandular lesions following phe-nylbutazone administration. 24However, adminis - tration of a PGE analogue prior to phenylbutazoneadministration did prevent the formation of glandu-lar lesions, suggesting increased prostaglandin E isprotective against lesion mecha - nism of NSAID-induced equine glandular gastricdisease remains to be determined. 2. Materials and MethodsDiagnosis Clinical signs are nonspecic for diagnosis of gastricdisease, whether glandular or squamous. Diagno-sis is conrmed via gastroscopy. There are cur-rently two glandular disease scoring systems: adescriptive, which was proposed in the recent European College of Equine Internal Medicine(ECEIM) consensus statement, 4and a quantitative 0 to 4 scale,10which was adapted from the EGUS Gastric Ulcer council scoring system25on squamous ulceration (Tables 1 and 2). As the relationship be-tween disease pathophysiology or severity and eitherscoring system remains to be established, scoring us-ing both systems may be prudent. Representativeimages of the different scoring systems are presentedin Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.Table 1.

ResultsTreatment of Naturally Occurring Disease There have been several prospective studies evalu-ating treatment of equine gastric glandular disease.Gastrogard aremains the treatment of choice for gas - tric ulcers of any type due to the large number ofstudies supporting its efcacy. A recent study sug-gests that several different commercially availableoral formulations of omeprazole were not bioequiva-lent, although differences between formulationswere relatively minor. 26Although no large-scale studies have been performed to compare healingrates between Gastrogard aand other commercially available products, one study using a formulationof enteric-coated granules suspended in a paste hadhealing rates that were similar to those previous-ly reported for Gastrogard. a27In contrast, com - pounded omeprazole has been shown to be less ef-fective than Gastrogard, awhich may in part be due to the pH of the formulation.28Recommended dos - ing regimens may differ among available omepra-zole products, and compounded formulations aretypically less effective.Regardless of the product used, glandular disease seemed to be more difcult to treat than squamousdisease. In one study, healing of EGSD grade /H113502 was observed in 86% of horses administered 1, 2, or4 mg/kg omeprazole for /H1101128 days, whereas healing of EGGD grade /H113502 was only observed in 14% of horses. 27Improvement was also better in horses with EGSD (96%) compared with EGGD (34%).27 The reason for the difference in healing is unknown,but it may be that either acid suppression alone isinsufcient for glandular lesion healing or that moreprofound acid suppression than what is achieved atstandard dosing regimens is required for glandularlesions. Recent data suggest that both type of diet and/or duration of fasting prior to omeprazole adminis-tration may impact both pharmacokinetics andpharmacodynamics of omeprazole. 29,30Importan- tly, feeding free-choice hay leads to decreased timeof acid suppression (30% to 40% of time of pH /H110214) compared with feeding a combination grain and haydiet (80%). Therefore, fasting horses prior to ad-ministration of omeprazole may be warranted.Exact time of fasting necessary to promote enhancedacid suppression is not known, but it is currentlyrecommended to fast overnight prior to Gastrogard a Fig. 2.

Right, ECEIM description,focal, 4. 429MEDICAL OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMadministration and then for approximately 90 min-utes afterward. bIf fasting is not possible, then in - creasing dose or increasing frequency may bewarranted. Other treatments that have been evaluated in healing of glandular lesions include sucralfate, mi-soprostol, and trimethoprim-sulphadimidine, anddietary supplements. Omeprazole plus sucral-fate 65% healing rate. 31Another study suggested that misoprostol may be superior toomeprazole plus sucralfate in healing, but not im-provement, of glandular disease. 32One study in a small number of horses suggested that combinationtrimethoprim-sulphadamidine with omeprazole didnot result in superior healing compared with healingwith omeprazole alone. 33Therefore, routine use of antimicrobials in treatment of glandular disease isnot presently recommended. A study in a smallnumber of horses suggested that treatment with apolysaccharide may be benecial. 34However, this study was neither blinded nor placebo controlled, making interpretation of results challenging. Basedupon the studies to date, the authors recommend using combination therapy of omeprazole withsucralfate, or omeprazole with misoprostol, asrst-line therapies. Due to the poor healing rateobserved with glandular compared with squamousdisease, it is important to perform gastroscopy inhorses with glandular disease at 4 to 6 weeks, priorto discontinuing treatment. Total duration oftreatment would be expected to be at least 6 to 8 weeks. If no response is observed at repeat gastros-copy, adding in additional treatments (i.e., adding inmisoprostol if initial therapy consisted of omepra-zole and sucralfate) may be warranted. Unfortu-nately, there is no data on the pharmacokinetic orpharmacodynamic interactions between these drugswhen used in combination therapy.Treatment of NSAID-Induced Lesions For NSAID-induced lesions, misoprostol (Table 3) isrecommended, although there is limited data to sup-port its use. There is one study that suggests it iseffective for prevention of phenylbutazone-inducedglandular lesions. 18The author (HEB) evaluated efcacy of misoprostol in healing of phenylbutazone-induced lesions in six horses. Following 2 weeks oftreatment, (5 /H9262g/kg PO every 8 hours in molasses), 2/3 misoprostol-treated horses and 0/3 placebo (mo-lasses only) horses healing.In horses with NSAID-induced mucosal erosion orulceration, omeprazole may be helpful in reducingacid exposure and additional damage. Followingdiscontinuation of NSAIDs, it is anticipated that 2 to4 weeks of treatment would result in resolution ofNSAID-induced EGGD. The authors recommendrepeating gastroscopy to evaluate lesions prior tostopping treatment. 4. Discussion Glandular disease can be more difcult to treat thansquamous disease, and may require ancillary ther-apies. Duration of treatment prior to resolution ofEGGD is typically longer than that observed forEGSD. Type of feed and duration of fasting shouldbe considered when determining treatment protocol.

Results Quarter Horses were younger (mean /H110214 years; range, 3 months to 21 years) than other breeds(mean /H1102110 years; range, 1 to 23 years). Pathogens causing concurrent or recent infection signsconsisted of rapidly progressive diffuse symmetricalmuscle atrophy (80%), stiff gait (74%), and fever(44%). All horses that received medical therapyimmediately upon admission survived to discharge(survival proportion, 87%). Leucocytosis was a common nding (60%).

Introduction Lameness is a frequent medical problem in horses.Aside from localizing techniques such as palpationand subsequent diagnostic blocking, radiographicinvestigation of the limbs, neck, and back is oftenthe rst choice in diagnostic testing. Digital radi-ography is widespread and arguably considered thestandard of practice. The advantages of digital sys-tems include the ability to manipulate images, applypost processing, centrally store, and quickly obtainand review images immediately after acquisition.Despite these advances in technology, the basics ofradiographic exposure and patient positioning havenot changed. When producing radiographic imagesusing digital technologies, the veterinarian or tech-nician must still correctly position and choose atechnique appropriate for the body part being im-aged. Faulty imaging due to poor positioning orinappropriate exposure can lead to under- or over-diagnosis of pathologic changes. The goal of diag-nostic imaging is to reach an accurate diagnosis totarget treatment specically. Well-positioned ra-diographic images acquired with the appropriatetechnique are a key component to reaching the cor-rect diagnosis. 2. Principles of X-Rays When a radiographic image is obtained, approxi-mately 90% of the x-ray photons are absorbed by thetissue and 10% of the photons pass through thepatient and reach the detector. Many of the ab-sorbed photons generate scattered radiation (Comp-ton scatter). These scattered photons travel in alldirections creating noise and degrading image qual-ity. The effect of scattered radiation can be mini-mized by collimating the x-ray beam to reduce thenumber of scattered photons (Fig. 1). The inverse square law states that the intensity or quantity of photons reaching the x-ray detector isinversely proportional to the square of the distancefrom the source. In other words, the farther awayyou are from the patient the less intense the photonsare that strike the plate. This is especially impor-tant for obtaining radiographic images in large bodyparts with portable generators. The typical lm 436 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEM NOTESfocal distance (distance from the plate to the gener-ator) is 60 cm. When imaging larger body partssuch as the caudocranial stifle, neck, or back it isimportant to maintain this distance. We can alsouse the inverse square law to our advantage andstand closer to the image detector and patient toimprove image quality when imaging larger bodyparts. By standing closer when obtaining radio-graphs of larger body parts, the increased quantityand intensity of photons reaching the plate will helpto reduce the commonly obtained gray, grainy im-ages (also known as quantum mottle; Fig. 2). Despite the ability to use electronic markers, the lead marker is still the gold standard in displayinglaterality. The positioning of the plate can vary theplacement of the electronic marker, making it unre-liable for denoting laterality. Although a properphysical label (displaying limb and projection) isideal, even a penny or paperclip taped to the plate todenote lateral is better than no marker at all. A large amount of patient data can be displayed on the digital image. Although it is essential toinclude patient information in the radiographicstudy, the amount of text burned onto the subjectmatter of the image should be minimized. Theoverlaying patient demographics, if burned into theimage, can superimpose on the included anatomyand mask pathologic change; this is especially truewhen collimating as the resultant image is small inrelation to the text size. Thus, take care not tocompromise the value of the radiograph by poorpositioning of study labeling, particularly as thisinformation is readily available in all Digital Imag-ing and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)viewers and is not necessary to include on theimages. 3. Patient and X-Ray Positioning The ideal conditions for obtaining most radiographsof equine joints is with the horse standing squareexcept for non-weight-bearing views. Unfortu-nately, not all of our equine patients are willing to stand square. As such, the equine practitionermust accommodate the patient to make quality ra-diographs. Radiographic examination of the stifle,especially the caudocranial image is a good exampleof this principle. For example, the optimal anglefor the the horse standing square (the tuber calcaneus is in line with the tuberischii). However, if the limb is slightly behind thevertical (camped out), or under the horse (campedunder), the angle must be adjusted to accommodatethe stance of the horse. If the horse is standingwith the limb behind it, the angle (caudoproximal tocraniodistal) will increase (be steeper) and viceversa for the horse that is stood under itself (Fig. 3).When evaluating the caudocranial stifle image foradequate positioning, the tibial plateau should su-perimpose itself from cranial to caudal and the tibialtuberosity should be distal (10 to 15 mm) to thetibial plateau (Fig. 4). If the tibial tuberosity isproximal to the tibial plateau, the angle is typicallytoo steep. The x-ray generator should be centeredapproximately 8 to 10 cm proximal to the indenta-tion created by the distal aspect of the thigh muscu-lature as it transitions to the proximal crus area.Joint narrowing in the stifle may be masked orfalsely created by inadequate positioning. Themost common areas of pathologic change in the stifleare associated caudal to Fig. 1. DP tarsus images. The image on the left is obtainedwith the collimator left open. The image on the right is obtainedwith the collimator narrowed to the boundaries of the tar-sus. There is moderate improvement of contrast and ne detailin the image obtained with the narrowed collimator. The bottomimages represent the corresponding images magnied to betterillustrate the improved detail and contrast due to the reduction inscatter. This is best seen in the medial malleolus and medialaspect of /H114082017 437MEDICAL MALADIES HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMthe tibial eminence and show the joint clearly (Fig.5). The superimposition of the medial femoral con-dyle with the tibial eminence can mask subtleconcave defects. Just as with the caudocranial pro-jection of the stifle, the angle of the x-ray generatorshould be 5-10\u00b0 proximal to distal in a square stand-ing horse. The most common mistakes are to be attoo steep of an angle or being too lateral. TheCd60L-CrM oblique seemingly highlights the lateraltrochlear ridge. However, a well-positioned lateralprojection has a similar sensitivity to the Cd60L-CrM oblique projection 77% vs 84%, respectively. 4 Limb positioning also affects acquisition of the lat-eral radiographic projection. If the horse is stand-ing base wide the x-ray generator will have to beangled distally; if base narrow, the generator anglewill be slightly proximal. Judging placement of thex-ray generator in a cranial-to-caudal fashion is bestdone by lining up with the heel bulbs and tarsus.The most common mistake is being too far cranial. Just as with the stifle, the x-ray generator angle on dorsoplantar radiographic projection of the tar-sus must change depending on conformation andstance. A horse with a normal angle to the tarsus,standing square, will require a 5-10\u00b0 proximal todistal angle, centered on the central tarsal bone tosee the distal joints. If instead the horse has apost-legged conformation the x-ray generator angleshould be relatively parallel with the ground. Sim-ilarly, if the limb is held behind the vertical, and hasa normal tarsus angle, the x-ray generator will beparallel with the ground. It is also important tonote that on the true dorsoplantar (DP) over the distal masking lesions found there (Fig. 6).

The image was obtained centering the x-ray beam just proximal to the 4th metatarsal bone and PROCEEDINGSMEDICAL TO FIND AND TREAT THEMimposed and the distal joints well visualized. Thisis performed by centering the x-ray beam at the levelof the central tarsal bone. The dorsal-plantar posi-tioning can be by palpating Laying a nger across the trochlea willgive you a guide for the position of the x-ray gener-ator. In addition, using the heel bulbs to line up will also help to direct positioning of the x-ray generator ina cranial-to-caudal fashion. The most common errorin positioning is obtaining the radiography too far dor-sal. This will project to the medial trochlear ridgedorsal to the lateral trochlear ridge (Fig. 7). Failingto be tangential to the distal joints is typically a result of beam angle. More often than not, the beam isangled slightly proximal, or up the leg. This istypically secondary to horse stance (wide base).Correction can be achieved by angling slightly dis-tal, or by repositioning the leg. The image high-lighting the dorsolateral and plantaromedialsurfaces of the tarsus is generally referred to as theDorso 55 medial-Plantarolateral oblique (DMPL-O),suggesting that the image is obtained with the beamon the dorsomedial aspect of the joint. However, itis typically easier and faster to transition from lat-eral positioning to Plantar 55 lateral-Dorsomedialoblique (PLDM-O) positioning, by staying on thesame side of the horse rather than adjusting to shootfrom underneath the horse with a DMPL-O projec-tion. Ideal positioning of the PLDM-O (5\u00b0) plantarolateral distal to dor-somedial tangentialto the distal tarsal joints. Radiographic examination of the neck has seen a dramatic increase in frequency in recent years.Unlike the distal extremities, the radiographer can-not see the x-ray detector on the opposite side of theneck. This creates positioning problems and oftenresults in images with one vertebral body or facetjoint that is not centered on the x-ray detector.Furthermore, the articular facets on the lateral ra-diographs may not be perfectly superimposed, whichcan lead to interpretation errors. However, if amoment is taken to palpate the transverse processesand apply white tape to these sites, this can serve asa guide to detector placement and x-ray generatorfocus (Fig. 8). Centering just proximal to the trans- verse process will render well-positioned radiographs,when the horse's poll is in line with the withers.Articular facets at the cranial and caudal aspect of the plate may not be superimposed, however, due tobeam divergence or parallax. This issue is typi-cally exacerbated with the short lm focal distanceused with portable x-ray generators. Symmetricalanatomy of the neck can make lesions difcult tolateralize. Oblique obtained canhelp localize lesions 5(Fig. 9 ). The x-ray generator is typically centered at the jugular furrow and thex-ray detector is placed with the transverse process Fig. 9.

The blue arrow is showingthe left articular facet joint and periarticular margins. The yel-low arrows highlight the right articular facet joint and jointspace. The red arrows are highlighting the shoulder muscula-ture, which summates with the C6-7 articular facets joints. Fig. 8. Tape has been applied to the skin at the level of thetransverse processes. The transverse process of the 3rd cervicalvertebra is typically the 1st process easily palpated. This 3rdcervical is the transverse processes are centered on the vertebralbody. Centering the x-ray just dorsal to the transverse processshould center the vertebral body /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 441MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMcentered at the bottom third of the x-ray detector.Radiographic images are named from where the x-generator is located and subsequently where thex-rays enter to where the x-rays exit the neck, andwhere the x-ray detector is located. In the exampleof a L55V-RD oblique the left articular facets will beprojected dorsally and the right transverse pro-cesses will be projected ventrally. Properly labeled,opposite oblique radiographs should be obtained to accurately localize the lesion. Well-positioned obliqueradiographs should project one side of the articularfacets dorsal and show the intervertebral foramenwell. The other articular facet joint will be super-imposed over the vertebral body highlighting thejoint width. Oblique radiographs obtained withportable units centered at the articular facets atC6-7 are challenging due to the shoulder superim-position. This may be overcome by offsetting theforelimbs, with the leg near the x-ray generatorpulled caudally.Radiographic projections are used to highlight specic areas and document pathologic change.The fetlock is an area with a multitude of pathologicchange in which appropriately positioned radio-graphs make the pathologic change easy to identify.For example, palmar/plantar process osteochondralfragmentation is a common abnormality in the fet-lock and depending on the location may be a sourceof lameness. The oblique views (dorso 20 proximo45 lateral-palmaromedial dorso 20 prox-imo 45 medial-palmarolateral oblique) should showthese lesions best. However, if the proximal sesa-moid bones superimpose this area, the fragmenta-tion could be easily missed. Ideal oblique and DPradiographs of the fetlock project the proximal ses-amoid bones proximal to the joint margin (Fig. 10).The flexed lateral of the fetlock highlights the sag-ittal ridge to document subchondral bone defectsand fragments.

The joint between the middle phalanx and navicular bone is artifactually narrow and the corti-cotrabecular bone is obscured due to summation of the cortex and trabecular bone. The bottom images are well positioned lateralprojections of the foot with different conformations. The left image has a foot that has a slightly broken back hoof-pasternconformation. The right image has a foot that has an upright conformation. The yellow line in the left shows a slight less angleneeded to be tangential to the navicular cortex, while the upright conformation requires a steeper angle (red line).

This will allow visualization of themid-to-dorsal aspect of the sagittal groove withoutsuperimposition. Obliquity is the most commonchallenge with this projection and can superimposelesions in the sagittal ridge, masking their appear-ance. More often the obliquity in the flexed lateralimage arises from the x-ray generator angled in adorsomedial to palmarolateral fashion. This maybe due to limb positioning or angle of the x-raygenerator. Although in the flexed position, the me-dial and lateral aspects of the condyle are typicallymore conspicuous and are easier to palpate to helpguide the angle at which the x-ray generator shouldbe to acquire a well-positioned radiograph (Fig. 11). The typical digital radiographic protocol for the foot is four views (lateromedial palmaro- proximal-palmarodistal oblique/skyline, dorso60proximal-palmardistal oblique). be one of the more difcult views toobtain, and is often the go to projection for assessingpathologic change. The lateral projection can aid inobtaining well-positioned skyline radiographs. Theangle of the bony column and navicular bone flexorsurface can be judged on the lateral images to guidethe angle of the skyline. Typically, the angle is 55\u00b0.However, in the upright or low-heel-conformed footit is necessary to change the angle of the x-ray gen-erator to get a well-positioned radiograph. Whenevaluating for radiographic positioning, you shouldsee the joint space between the middle phalanx andthe navicular bone well, and mild summation withthe distal phalanx centrally and at the level of thepalmar processes. Pseudo sclerosis of the trabecu-lar bone of the navicular bone caused by summationof the flexor cortex can lead to misinterpretation(Fig. 12). Thus, proper positioning is paramountfor judging corticotrabecular bone Theaddition of oblique palmarodistal oblique) may help tohighlight the fossa of the collateral ligament andpotentially any occult fractures on the D60P images(Table 1). 7,8Acute fracture may only be seen onD60P 50L-P oblique images and should be consid-ered in all lame horses localizing to the foot. 4. Conclusions Patient preparation and positioning, adequate tech-nique, and knowing how to correct malpositionedradiographs are skills in achieving diagnostic radio-graphic images (Table 1). Taking a moment to assessunintentional obliquity, patient conformation, andstance can reduce retakes and reduce radiationexposure.

Foot-related lameness is one most frequentlyencountered problems in equine practice. Correc-tive shoeing is a frequently used preventative andtherapeutic discipline for the treatment of manycauses of lameness. 1-3Digital radiography allows accurate and repeated measurement of certain pa-rameters that are used as an important aid in trim-ming and the application of therapeutic shoes. 1 The effects of altering hoof angles on distal limbjoint angles have been described. 3,4Important clinical decisions are made on the basis of measure-ments of only a few degrees of angulation in magni- tude. 1Adhering to the smallest details when making farrier decisions can enhance success. Specic radiographic information remains the professional standard when seeking answers for po-diatry issues that require mechanical, therapeutictrimming, and/or shoeing. The primary goal fortherapeutic applications is to offset the mechanicallimitations and enhance the healing environment.Using specic beam/subject/cassette orientation fo-cused on the particular area of interest, the cliniciancan produce consistent, comparable images that of-fer the best representation of the soft-tissue param-eters, the cofn bone, and the hoof capsule, thusenabling strategic decisions. This information is ofutmost importance as a set of reference points fortherapeutic trimming and shoeing decisions as theydene the interconnectedness of the internal struc-tures with external hoof-capsule characteristics. The basic physics of radiation supports the low- beam concept. Radiographs are produced by elec-trons that travel in straight lines. Those beingomitted from the center of the focal spot produce thebest possible image of the targeted area. The re-maining beams diverge from the primary beam rel-ative to the focal point size of the generator and thefurther they diverge the more oblique the portion ofthe image furthest from center beam becomes. 5 Purpose-driven images produced by focusing on thedistal hoof capsule offer several advantages over thepreviously recommended higher beam. The exact centering of the radiographic beam for the lateral-medial foot projection has been variablydescribed in the literature. 1Generally, the hori- zontal beam is centered below the coronary bandmidway between the dorsal hoof wall and the bulbs /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 445MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEM NOTESof the heel for a lateral view of the cofn bone.6 The centering distance from the coronary band isreported at 2 and 3 cm for standard foot examina-tion, or 2 cm proximal to the solar surface for theassessment of distal phalanx rotation, or throughthe axis of the navicular bone for the assessment ofnavicular bone disease. 7-9 The low beam lateral-medial (L-M) projection pro- duces consistent, comparable images of the soft-tis-sue parameters that hold valuable information forthe veterinarian-farrier team, e.g., sole depth andcup (SD), rim balance and indicateswhether a higher projection is indicated to evaluatecofn and pastern joint articular symmetry. Theseparticular areas of interest are not distorted by obliquebeam travel nor obscured by the shoe. They are ofgreat interest as each can be altered by the rasp,farrier's knife, nippers, shoe style, and placement.The hoof capsule is also altered by conditions such asthe effects of the trim and shoe, growth rate and de-ciencies, deformities, injury, and pathological diseasesyndromes. The information that can be obtained from this low-beam protocol has diagnostic as well as prognos-tic value and is a reliable means of monitoring theefciency of therapeutic trimming and shoeing, andpreventive foot-maintenance programs. Veterinar-ians are responsible for obtaining the images thatare useful guidelines for the trimming, shoe design,and application. Interpreting the parameters fromeven a medical standpoint requires good workingknowledge of the foot. When those basic require-ments are yet to be learned, the veterinarian mustrely heavily on collaboration with the farrier. Thefarrier who has never had the opportunity to learnhow to use radiographic information to help him orher ne-tune their efforts must then rely equally onthe experience and dedication of the veterinarian. 2. Materials and Methods Obtaining informative images to enhance therapeu-tic trimming and shoeing decisions requires twopositioning blocks designed with a sagittal andtransverse opaque surface marker that denes theground surface of the bare foot. The height of theblocks should be 10 to 20 mm below the level ofthe crosshairs on the collimator of the generator.Most generators have laser pointers that have high-er-visibility beam locators in bright light than thelight-source crosshair. However, the laser pointerdoes not remain centered and requires maintenancealignment using the set screws on the collimator.The block-to-crosshairs relationship is of utmost im-portance as it assures consistent beam-to-subjectorientation that is of paramount importance for ob-taining consistent, and comparable images. Preparation of the foot for radiographs is required to obtain quality images. The foot and hair on thecoronet and pastern should be free of mud, medica-tion, and other debris to prevent the foreign mate-rial from being superimposed over anatomicalstructures that can be misinterpreted as possiblelesions, and/or simply obscure areas of interest.The sole, frog, and sulci need to be cleaned with awire brush for baseline lateral-medial and DP views.Removing all tags, uneven areas, and excess growthfrom the frog with a farrier's knife helps eliminateartifacts (Fig. 1). The positioning blocks and the generator should be on an identical and preferably flat plane. Theposition of feet and blocks may be adjusted relativeto any toe-in or toe-out conformation. The foot isplaced on the medial edge of the block with thesagittal plane parallel to the linear alignment of theblock. This offers zero lm-to-subject distance andeliminates unwarranted magnication. The primarybeam is centered on the foot midway between toe andheel, perpendicular to the sagittal plane of the foot andperpendicular to the cassette. A bead of radiopaque paste is placed along the dorsal face of the hoof from the coronary crest to thedistal border of the toe for the L-M view (Fig. 2).This opaque marker offers a relatively reliablemeans of measuring and monitoring the coronary/extensor process distance (CE). Neither the crestnor the actual surface of the dorsal wall is visiblewithout the reference line. A lucent zone appearsbetween the paste and what appears to be the wallsurface. The use of paste as a marker has advan- Fig. 1. Properly removing debris and cornied imperfection ar-eas can enhance image clarity and helps eliminate artifacts. 446 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMtages over other techniques such as using nails,needles, coins, and marking tape to help dene thewall surface, given that none of those alternativemarkers conform to the unique characteristics of thegrowth ring patterns, which provide valuable infor-mation describing the hoof capsule's past history(Fig. 3). Traditionally, foot-radiography protocols recom- mended the removal of shoes. This recommendationis still sound when the shoe might be superimposed over the subject of interest. However, the low beamdoes not superimpose the shoe over any part of thefoot, allowing the farrier and veterinarian an unob-structed view of the SD, PA, and DB distance.It is best to leave the shoes on for the baseline viewsas they offer useful information of the existing rela-tionship of the shoe to the pertinent soft-tissue pa-rameters and overall balance. Performingradiography with the shoes in place can also beuseful to evaluate the mechanical relationship of theshoe with the load surface, soft-tissue parameters,and digital alignment. Taking into consideration the time lapse since the last trim or shoe reset can offer valuable informationthat alludes to the influence of the pre-existing trimand shoe over the past days to weeks. Recordingthe exact or approximate date of the last trim orreset can enhance case interpretation, e.g., a SD of10 mm on a foot shod only a few hours or days maybe of less concern than 10 mm of sole on a foot shod6 weeks previously. When presented with a horsewith a very thin sole, for whatever reason, this maynot be recognized as such, but a glance at the lateralimage with the shoe on can provide valuable infor-mation. Awareness of this condition can preventunwarranted pain and damage to sensitive struc-tures during subsequent shoe removal. Therefore,preparation to protect the vulnerable sole can bemade before the shoes are pulled. The low-beam L-M orientation will consistently produce an image revealing one branch of the shoeand the basic information that is critical for specicmechanical shoeing protocols. To facilitate the cor-relation of the image information with externallandmarks it is helpful to display the image astaken, e.g, L-M view, left feet point left and rightfeet point right. The DP view should also be dis-played as taken. Horizontal flipped images unwar-rantedly complicate the mechanical thought process(Fig. 4). Exceptions are feet with /H1102225 mm of SD, pads/shoes, and other devices that elevate the footand palmar rim above the primary beam that is Fig. 2. Low-beam lateral requirements: the horse is placed onthe blocks in a natural square stance relative to the toe-in/toe-outconformation, primarily beam 10 to 15 proximal and horizontal tothe contact surface, perpendicular to the sagittal plane and cas-sette, zero lm subject distance, and opaque wall marker alongthe dorsal face from coronary crest to toe. Fig. 3. Note that the growth ring pattern, actual wall surface,and CE are clearly revealed by the bead of paste along the dorsalface of the hoof. Fig. 4.

When thestandard low beam is used in these circumstances,the image reveals one branch of the shoe, but twowings of the cofn bone, even when medial/lateralbalance exists. In these cases, compensate for thelow beam relative to the increased distance fromcenter of primary beam to the palmar rim, the x-raymachine needs to be raised accordingly (Fig. 5).Otherwise, evaluation of medial-lateral balance,sole depth and cup will be questionable. The standard low-beam image is considerably dif- ferent from the recommended high beam, which pro-duces an undistorted image of the navicular boneand cofn joint but grossly distorts the distal anat-omy that is of primary interest (Fig. 6). The highbeam invariably reveals two branches of the shoeand both wings of the cofn bone unless remarkablemedial-lateral imbalance is present. In the case ofremarkable listing, the wings can appear superim-posed due to beam divergence. High-beam lateralimages that reveal superimposed wings of the cof-n bone can lead one to believe that good palmar-rim balance exists when the foot actually isremarkably out of balance and most often listingmedially (Fig. 7). The low-beam DP view reveals the load planes of the palmar rim along with associated soft-tissueparameters and cofn-bone characteristics; the re-sulting image also alludes to joint-plane symmetry,which may be an indication for subsequent higher-beam studies at the level of the joint surfaces.To avoid unwarranted misrepresentation of the po-sition of the bone within the capsule and symmetryof the joint surfaces, the horse should be positionedin a natural load stance with head held in line withthe sagittal plane. 1 There are several parameters that are important for the farrier to know, as each is altered with everytrim and shoeing procedure (Fig. 8). When pathol-ogy and imbalance require specic mechanical re-alignment, it is vital that farriers know what theyhave to work with and what, if any, limitations needto be addressed before they start. The SD is de-ned as the vertical distance between the palmar/plantar margin of the cofn bone and the outersurface of the sole. It is routinely measured at thedistal tip, or apex, of the cofn bone, e.g., SD of 10mm and 3 mm cup of foot can be recorded as SD 10/3.When farriers are well aware of the distance be-tween the sole and the cofn bone, it helps themavoid removing or leaving too much foot. The PA is measured by one line along the palmar rim of the wings and one along the ground or loadsurface of the capsule. A bead of paste placed on Fig. 5. Signicantly increasing the distance between the positioning block and the palmar rim requires the beam to be raisedaccording to evaluate SD and PA. Fig. 6. A, Low beam, horizontal to the ground, centered to the foot, 10 to 20 mm above the positioning blocks, perpendicular to thesagittal plane and cassette, producing one branch of the shoe. B, High beam, positioned just below the coronary band, producing twobranches of the shoe and both wings with an illusion of media/lateral imbalance.448 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICAL TO FIND AND TREAT THEMthe skin-frog junction and another on the apex of thefrog can allude to the plane of the palmar rim, whichis revealed on the L-M image. This image is ofparamount importance for specic trimming andshoe decision making (Fig. 9). When the apex iseroded or altered by load and/or pathology, the PA isreferenced from the palmar rim line along thestraightest part of the wings (Fig. 10). When theshoe type/design alters the PA, it is referred to asthe \"PA with the ground\" (Fig. 11). The DB is measured by dropping a vertical line from the apex to the ground surface, and forwardfrom this line to the point where the hoof or shoedoes not contact the ground surface. This area in-creases with growth between resets and invariablydecreases when the foot is trimmed. The PA, SD, and DB are invariably altered with every trim and shoe application, as the farrier re-moves ground surface wall and sole. When theseparameters are unknown and the toe appears re-markably out of proportion with the crushed heel,the dorsal face is often backed up to reduce breakover and hoof angle in an effort to give the foot abetter-balanced appearance (Fig. 12). This practicecan be counterproductive and unfortunately hasvery little if any signicant positive effect. Whenspecic mechanical goals are to be achieved it isimportant that the farrier be well aware of theseparameters, especially when the horse is faced withcareer and life-threatening issues (Fig. 13).The bone angle (BA) holds interest for the farrier and veterinarian even though their interest is quitedifferent. This angle is measured by a line alongthe most appropriate dorsal face of the cofn boneintersecting with another along the palmar rim ofthe wing (Fig. 14). Many believe all feet are iden-tical and should therefore look alike and match out-side, but this is a misconception, at best. Boneangle can vary from 35\u00b0 up to 65\u00b0, and often vary 5\u00b0to 10\u00b0 between feet on the same horse. 10The toe angle and basic hoof stereotype is directly influencedby the bone angle. Therefore, farriers should beaware of this radiographic information when theyare expected to match hoof angles that simply can-not be matched due to different bone angles. The bone angle is also of interest to veterinarians who are considering inferior check-ligament desmo-tomy for the treatment of a club foot. The boneangle within the club foot can be as much as 10\u00b0larger than that of the opposite foot. Frequently,the goal of surgery and therapeutic shoeing is toeliminate the \"club\" appearance by decreasing deepdigital flexor tendon tension and lowering the over-all toe and heel angle. However, a 60\u00b0 bone angleand a 0\u00b0 PA club foot following surgery and shoeingstill leaves the hoof angle a noticeable 10\u00b0 differentfrom the opposite foot, which most likely has a nat-ural 50\u00b0 BA and zero PA. This brings into questionthe validity of the decision to perform surgery whenthere is an initial low PA and 60\u00b0 BA. Fig. 7. A, Low beam: note two wings. B, Note medial listing.

Results Specic beam-to-subject orientation provides tre-mendous information concerning the relationshipbetween the structures of the foot and ground forces.This information guides the veterinarian and farrieras they make crucial therapeutic trimming, shoedesign, and placement decisions. The detailed pro-tocol offers the veterinarian and farrier a reliablemeans of monitoring any alteration of or changes tothe parameters described when assessing the prog-ress/regression of the issue. In addition, this pro-tocol allows close scrutiny of the efciency andmechanical factors of the chosen therapeutic trim-ming and shoeing. made throughoutthe specic trimming and shoeing process have en-hanced the application and success of many complexpodiatry cases.

Post-shoeing images are standard protocol for many vet-farrier collaborations. Radiographic evi-dence that conrms the achieved is multipurpose. These images be-come the new baseline reference and are paramountdocumentation for farriers and veterinarians to gaina better understanding of the ner details that arerequired to mechanically make their job more pre-cise in an effort to enhance the healing environment(Fig. 16). This disciplined protocol signicantly improves the standard of care for podiatry cases by offeringdetailed information required for specic therapeu-tic trimming and shoeing. Farriers have developedmore condence with cases by increasingtheir knowledge and skills through radiographic in-formation that enables them to visualize what theyhave to work with and how well they can follow theirgoals. Veterinarians who have adopted this protocol also have gained knowledge, condence, and skills asthey become more involved with searching for usefulinformation that before was not available to theteam effort. Formerly generic recommendations,such as to raise or lower the heel, back the toe up, ortip the inside can now be replaced with more specicreference points and parameters, and more favor-able results can be expected as the farrier and vet-erinarian become more aligned with basic podiatryprincipals. The odds for success are greatly im-proved when farriers use radiographic informationas it relates to their respective task at hand, and theveterinarian has working knowledge of the thera-peutic trimming and shoeing process. Specic radiographic information described should be utilized by the veterinarian and farrierwith a team approach. A well-made strategic planbased on the basic mechanical requirements of thefoot can greatly improve the outcome and success ofmany podiatry cases. The case of the club-footedfoal and the chronic laminitis case with cofn-bonesole penetration are some of the typical examples ofhow radiographs can help the farrier and veterinar-ian discover the unique relationships that are hid-den within the hoof capsule, identify the unhealthyareas of the foot, and proceed to design and executean efcient mechanical plan to achieve the proposedgoals (Figs. 17, 18, and 19). 4.

Imagedistortion can lead to misrepresentation and an in-correct diagnosis. Therefore, we must modify ourradiography protocol to get the most accurate imagewith the best information on which to base our in-terpretation, our mechanical evaluation, and our ul-timate decision making. The option of using low-beam orientation focused on the particular area ofinterest can produce consistent, comparable imagesthat offer the best representation of the soft-tissueparameters, the cofn bone, and hoof capsule, en-abling efcient and strategic decisions. This infor-mation is of utmost importance as a reference pointfor therapeutic trimming and shoeing.

Therefore, it is stillimpossible to have an undisputed absolute, accuratemeasurement. All measurements are made of twoelements; prociency, and how well we control thehuman error factor. Therefore, all are subjectiveand at best only reasonably accurate. Although radiographic examination of the equine foot has made tremendous advancements in the pastdecade allowing us to better understand normalanatomy and how it relates to lameness, the use ofradiographic information of the foot to enhance thera-peutic trimming and shoeing remains a challenge formany practitioners. The radiographic anatomy iscomplicated by superimposed horn capsule, bone andsoft tissue, as well as areas of different air density. The veterinarian and farrier must be well in- formed of the radiographic information that relatesdirectly to his or her task of achieving the proposedmechanical goals. The widespread use of digitalradiography has enabled the practitioner to obtainhigh-quality resolution and detailed images that areimmediately available for the collaborating vet/far-rier team. Computer technology advantages suchas smartphones and/or tablets are common tools forthe progressive vet/farrier team, making it possiblefor them to discuss pertinent details relative to ra-diographic images, photos, and proposed goals whenschedules and commitments are not compatible. However, many practitioners have little or no ex- perience of the farrier trade or its skills; they nd itdifcult to be aware of the information that canguide the eyes and hands of the farrier. Likewise,many farriers have not had the opportunity to learnhow to comprehend the radiographic informationthat is of utmost importance to their task and re-sponsibility, and have historically tried to under-stand and interpret grossly distorted images thatrelate to their role and responsibility. Some practitioners may have limited experience with the radiographic procedure and patient posi-tioning for exams that produce consistent compar-ative images of specic areas of interest fortherapeutic trimming and shoeing. Using the tra-ditional high-beam orientation to examine the entirefoot has led to misrepresentation and misinterpre-tation and has handicapped the efforts and outcomeof therapeutic goals and treatment protocols. Theveterinarian's choice of beam orientation is of para- Fig. 18. A, Horse with chronic laminitis with sole penetration of the cofn bone.

The mechanical influence on the horse's foot of trimming and shoeing for therapeutic purposes ispoorly understood by some farriers and veterinari-ans as traditional methods have dictated trimmingand shoeing to mimic a healthy, balanced foot re-gardless of the issue, and without consideration ofthe forces within the foot that influence vital growthcenters. By taking the standard recommended ra-diographic views a step further and helping the col-laborating professions learn how to obtain and usethis specic radiographic information, we have de-veloped a higher standard of care that enhanceswell-informed therapeutic trimming and shoeing de-cision making.

Unlike front feet where these imbalances most commonly cause foot pain, in the rear feetthe changed biomechanics cause pain higher up the limb. Addressing rear hoof imbalance shouldbe as important to treat or prevent lameness as it is in the front leg. Author's address: TurnerEquine Sports of hoof imbalance on fore limb lamenesshas been well documented. However, rear limb im-balance and its effect on lameness has largely beenignored. The purpose of this paper is to discuss thecommon hoof imbalances that have been describedin the rear hoof, compare those to the forefoot, dis-cuss possible pathophysiology, and nally discussthe effect these rear hoof imbalances have on lame-ness of the rear leg. Different biomechanics exist between the forelimb and rear limb. Also, rear hoof biomechanics affectthe movement (biomechanics) of the upper limb per-haps and these alterations in biomechanics can re-sult in lameness. Only three types of hoof imbalance have been de- scribed for the rear hoof compared with the frontfeet, which minimally has at least six. 1The rear feet develop dorso-plantar imbalance, under-runheels, or plantar surface imbalance, as well as medial-to-lateral imbalance. Unlike the front feet,contracted heels are very rare problems as arehorses with mismatched rear feet. It is not thatthis cannot occur but the incidence seems to be solow as not to be important. Finally, in the frontfeet, small hoof-to-body size is a signicant problemwith important prognostic implications, but it hasyet to be recognized in the rear feet. Generally, therear feet are smaller than the front feet and thereare no formulas to evaluate this parameter in therear feet. 2. Broken Hoof-Pastern Axis This is the most common rear limb hoof imbalance.1 The hind hoof is normally slightly more uprightthan the forefoot, usually by approximately 5\u00b0.But like the front foot the dorsal hoof wall and thepastern should be in the same alignment. Manyfactors can affect this: 1) Older horses often showfetlock hyperextension due to suspensory weakness(age related) and this in turn causes a broken for-ward hoof pastern axis. 2) Pain in the front feetcan cause the horse to place its feet further underthe body. 3) Long toes and under-run heels in thefront feet cause a similar postural change. The lat-ter two postural changes cause the heels in the rearfeet to be overloaded and subsequently retards the AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 455MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEM NOTESgrowth of the heels. The heels are the rst part ofthe hoof to distort. Unlike the forelimb where hoof imbalances most frequently lead to foot pain, rear hoof imbalancecauses problems higher up in the limb. 2A broken back hoof axis with a negative solar angle is themost common hoof imbalance of the rear foot. 1 This imbalance causes the hoof to stay on the groundlonger than normal. Further, the strain on thedeep flexor will be markedly increased over normalbefore heel lift. This can lead to many lamenessissues. The most serious problem is tenosynovitisof the distal tendon sheath. Although not the mostcommon lameness caused by this imbalance becauseof its effect on the deep flexor tendon it is the mostserious. This can lead to marked swelling in thesheath, pain, and even disruption of the blood sup-ply to the tendon. 1The most common lameness associated with this imbalance is tarsitis, inflamma-tion of the hock. In an unpublished retrospectivestudy conducted by the author, the risk factors forhorses needing hock injections was evaluated. Thenegative solar angle was a common risk factoramong all horses needing hock injections. This isprobably due to this imbalance causing an increasedstance time for the limb. In a different study, thisimbalance was associated with a high incidence ofgluteal pain in horses. 3 The hind hooves have a more exaggerated heel- rst landing than the front hooves.2During land - ing the rear hooves slide horizontally after the hooftouches the ground. At midstance the cofn jointis maximally flexed maximal extension occursat the termination of stance. Therefore, anythingthat increases the terminal stance phase will in-crease joint extension and therefore dorsal rim pres-sure on the joints. It is possibly the extra work ofthe flexor tendon muscle and increased strain on thetendon to overcome the negative solar angle of thecofn bone that causes the stress and damage withinthe tendon sheath. In addition, it is likely the in-creased stance phase and increased dorsal rim pres-sure on the tarsus that creates inflammation in thedistal tarsal joints. Correction of this imbalance would seem simple: raise the heels to correct the negative solar angle.However, the author has noted this causes otherproblems. The increased heel height further exag-gerates heel-rst landing, increasing the heel pres-sure plus increased heel height increases heelpressure during midstance. 2In addition, this al - ters the hoof flight and riders have complained thatit changes the gait. A different approach wouldseem appropriate. The author has used radicallyrockered shoes to improve rollover and reduce ten-don strain. This has been benecial for tendonsheath swelling cases. 3. Plantar Surface Imbalance Abnormal heel conformation of the hind feet is easyto recognize. 4When looking at the limb from theside, the digit will show a broken back-hoof pasternaxis. The slope of the coronary band from the toe tothe heel will have an acute angle. The bulbs of theheels will have a bending appearance and can beseen lying against the shoe palmar to the end of the heel. The dorsal hoof wall begins to take on a\"bull-nosed\" appearance. Looking at the foot frombehind, the frog is situated well below the hoofwall and the frog can be seen to prolapse downbetween the two branches of the shoe. The frog isgenerally large from the constant stimulation withthe ground. Upon removing the shoe, the end of the heel of the hoof wall is located well forward from the base ofthe frog. 4The horn tubules will be parallel with the ground. The hoof wall at the heel will be thin,there will be no angle to the sole, and the bars will beabsent. The whole frog will be pushed down belowthe hoof wall. When the foot is placed on theground, total weight bearing will be placed on thefrog and many horses are reluctant to stand on itwhen the opposing limb is lifted off the ground. Viewing the ground surface of the foot, there will be a \"trough\" noted between the apex of the frog andthe inner branch of the shoe at the toe. 4Hoof testers placed on either side of the heel at the angleof the sole will elicit a painful response. Damage tothe heels of the hind feet is often easier to improvethan damage to the forefeet, possibly due to thedifference of the load encountered on the hind limbsvs. the fore limbs. Three methods can be employedto treat this condition. First, allowing a horse to go without hind shoes\u2014if possible\u2014for 4 to 8 weeks can be veryeffective. 4This approach can also be used with horses that are resting due to lameness issues.The shoes are removed and the hoof wall at theheels is moved in a plantar direction until solidstructures of the hoof wall are encountered. Thehoof wall at the toe is lowered appropriately andthe edges are rounded. Over the next few weeks,the pressure on the frog will compress and dis-place the frog until it assumes the same plane asthe heels on either side. If the horse needs to continue in work and wear shoes, a different approach has been described. 4 The shoes are removed and the heels are trimmed ina plantar direction until solid horn is established.Excess dorsal hoof wall is removed from toe quarterto toe quarter. The goal is to compress the pro-lapsed frog to have a flat, even plane that includesboth the heels and the frog. The back section of adegree pad is cut out to t over the frog as a mirrorimage. A thin strip extending across the toe is leftattached to the frog wedge and two 4.5 race nails areplaced through this strip into the hoof wall at the toequarters to hold the frog wedge directly over thefrog. An Animalintex self-contained poultice is satu- rated with water and applied so it envelops thewhole foot. It is secured to the foot bandage. 456 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSMEDICAL HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMThe horse is placed in a stall with a rm surface for24 to 48 hours. During this time, the feet are sub-merged in a bucket of water a few times to keep thepoultice saturated. At the onset of applying thefrog wedge, the horse is give n2go f phenylbutazone because some horses will show discomfort and oth-ers may develop a digital pulse. When the poulticeis removed, the frog will be compressed between theheels forming a flat even surface that includes thefrog and both heels. The horse can be shod imme-diately, or can be placed in a stall bedded withsawdust for an additional day to let the feet dry out.The frog will be soft and can be shaped further.Any additional horn at the heels can be removed sothe heels of the hoof wall are solid and approach thebase of the frog\u2014being careful to keep the frog andboth heels in the same plane. A shoe can be ttedand applied. The same principles apply when shoe-ing hind feet as the front, where a line is drawnacross the widest part of the foot and the shoe istted so the line is placed in the middle of the shoe.In the hind feet, the branches of the shoe may ex-tend marginally beyond the end of the heels. Ifadditional heel elevation is necessary, a wedge pador a bar wedge can be placed under the heels as longas the shoe is tted in the manner described. Thiswill concentrate the load under the frog and heelsrather than behind the heels, which is the case witha long shoe. A third approach is to trim the heels as suggested above but trim the front half of the hoof in a differ-ent plane. 4This maximizes rollover of the hoof. The effect has been to reduce strain on tendonsheaths and the deep flexor tendon but it has notbeen successful in restoring the hoof capsule. 4. Medio-Lateral Imbalance Most people nd medio-lateral balance more dif-cult to assess in the hind feet than in the front feet. 1 The balance of the hoof dictates its placement andaffects hoof flight. 2Because the pelvis, stifle, and hock all have some lateral movement, it is easy for ahoof that has worn uneven or has been trimmed outof balance to cause the entire limb to move out ofline. Because of the asymmetrical movement of the hock, the hind limb has a slight rotating actionas it moves forward over the foot. This is neces-sary to ensure that the feet are wider than theforelegs when galloping. In many animals thisleads to an unnatural wear on the lateral branchof the hoof causing the hoof capsule to be high onthe inside. 1 The author's assessment of has corroborated the high medial observation.The rear feet are much more commonly high medi-ally, in contrast, the front hooves are more likely tobe high laterally. This causes change in the horse'sstance. The tendency is for the leg to rotate inwardand the limb to be placed more medially. In addi-tion, there are effects on the limb in general. Withhigh medial wall, the limb develops a varus defor-mity and the fetlock, hock, and stifle can each beinvolved. Many different lamenesses have been at-tributed to this conformation. 2Injury to the lateral branch of the suspensory ligament has been noted.1 In addition, increased pressure on the inside of thejoints can cause lameness of the fetlock, hock, andstifle. In evaluating rear hoof imbalance cases the author has noted an increased associationwith both distal hock lameness and medial femoro- tibial lameness. 5. Evaluation of Rear Hoof Imbalance It is best to assess hind-limb hoof balance with bothrear legs bearing weight equally. 1Hind limbs nat - urally rotate outward and must be assessed from thefront and back of the limb. An imaginary line fromthe hock should bisect the hoof with relatively equalhalves. Frequently, the hoof looks out of balancewhen the foot is raised. With the foot raised, thehock moves toward the opposite hind limb and theplantar surface of the distal limb rotates outwardalong its long axis. Attempting to balance the hoofby sighting down the back of the cannon bone ismisleading, and will in most instances make thehoof look high on the inside. The best way to assess hoof balance (in the au- thor's opinion) is to use radiography to evaluate howthe bones align within the hoof capsule. The rearfeet can be approached exactly like the front feet.However, there are more technical difculties asso-ciated with rear feet. First, it is more difcult toget horses to stand on the blocks with their rear feet.Two, because the rear legs naturally rotate outalignment can be more difcult. Accurate identication of key points on the foot, allowing for evaluation of dorsal hoof wall and heelangles, sole depth, and medial and lateral wallheight, is not always possible, depending on thetechnique used and the conformation of the foot. 3 Digital radiography allows improved visualizationof soft tissues; however, accurate identication ofthe coronary band and heels can still be difcult.Edge burn-through (saturation artifact) at the pe-riphery of soft tissues is a common artifact withdigital radiography. This can result in inaccurateassessment of hoof wall thickness. The author hasused lower power techniques with digital radiogra-phy so the edge burn-out does not occur and thecontrast can then be adjusted digitally so that mark-ers are less necessary. But markers are the mostreliable identiers. Rigid metallic markers or bar-ium paste have been used. The goal is to accuratelyidentify the true border of the dorsal wall and con-tour. The marker should equal the length of the toeand should be contoured to the true shape of thewall. Running a 2-mm bead of barium paste di-rectly over the dorsal median hoof wall, extendingfrom the coronary band to the tip of the toe, allowsfor accurate identication of the toe length, wallcontour, and border, and provides for an apprecia-tion of hoof wall distortion. A halo artifact (Uber- /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 457MEDICAL MALADIES OF THE HORSE: HOW TO FIND AND TREAT THEMschwinger) may be seen surrounding the barium,but this will not preclude accurate border identi-cation. Spot marking at the widest point of theproximal (coronary) and distal wall in the quarters,at the proximal and distal wall in the heels, and atthe apex of the frog will aid in the evaluation ofquarter angles, quarter wall height, heel angle andheight, sole depth, and toe-to-heel ratio. It is crucial that the positioning of the patient, foot, and x-ray beam be accurate when evaluatingthe foot for the purposes of podiatry. 5True assess - ment and measurement of the dorsal hoof wall andheel angle, sole depth, joint congruity, medial-to-lateral balance, and toe-to-heel ratio is dependent onproper positioning. Slight abduction or adductionof the limb or shifting of weight can cause jointincongruity on the horizontal beam dorsal-palmarview. The horse should be placed on a rm, levelfooting, with the limbs squarely beneath the horse.Limb conformation should also be evaluated prior totaking radiographs. When placing the foot on thepositioning blocks, it is important to allow the foot toposition itself as dictated by the limbs conformation(toed-in, toed-out). To reduce magnication, thefoot should be placed on the positioning block in sucha way that the foot is as close as possible to thecassette or sensor plate. The lateromedial and horizontal dorsopalmar pro- jections are the most useful views to perform whenevaluating the foot for conformation and balance. 5 Consideration of the area of interest as well as hav-ing solid anatomical knowledge of the horse's footis important when performing these radiographicviews. The lateromedial (L-M) projection is performed with the horse standing squarely on a flat, levelsurface with each foot on a positioning block of equalheight. It is important that the cannon bone beperpendicular to the floor in both the medial-to-lateral and dorsal-to-palmar planes. Keeping thehorse's head and neck straight is also important toreduce the influence of uneven loading of any onelimb. 5Focal-lm distance usually ranges between 24 and 28 inches; it is important to be consistent andthat once the technique is established, the focal-lmdistance remains constant. Once the horse is posi-tioned squarely, proper beam alignment and posi-tioning is the next step in obtaining a workableimage. If the area of interest is the distal phalanx and the purpose of the study is evaluating foot balanceand symmetry, the center of the beam should be aimed1.5 to 2.0 cm proximal to the weight-bearing surface and midway between the toe and the heel; the beamangle should be parallel with the heel bulbs and theground surface. This beam alignment will producea lm that shows the medial and lateral solar mar-gins and palmar processes of the distal phalanxsuperimposed on one another (in the \"normal\" foot).Any obliquity in the image can be corrected by rais-ing or lowering the central beam to adjust for vari-ation in sole depth, or adjusting the beam angle inrelation to the heel bulbs. Correct positioning reduces the likelihood of arti- factual changes to the joint space that might other-wise be interpreted as joint asymmetry and footimbalance. 5This projection allows evaluation of medial-to-lateral balance and conformation of thefoot with observation and measurement of the me-dial and lateral wall length and angle, and the ori-entation of the distal phalanx within the hoofcapsule. Orientation of the distal phalanx can beassessed by measuring the distance from the artic-ular surface of the distal phalanx to the groundsurface; the solar canal can also be used as a refer-ence point, but it is less consistent. Using the solarmargin as a point of reference can be variable due tochanges that can occur in the bone. In horses with\"ideal\" conformation, the articular surface of thedistal phalanx is parallel to the ground, as is a linebetween the medial and lateral coronary bandand, the medial and lateral walls are of equalthickness, and the distance from the medial andlateral solar margins to the ground are similar.In horses with signicant rotation or angulation inthe distal limb, the relation of the distal phalanxwith the ground may not be as symmetrical. Fur-thermore, the distal interphalangeal joint spaceshould be approximately even across its width re-gardless of angulation of the phalanges. It is nor-mal for the medial quarter wall to be at a slightlysteeper angle and subsequently measure shorter inlength. However, caution in overinterpretation ofjoint incongruency is recommended, because anymalpositioning of the limb or foot can create theappearance of medial-to-lateral imbalance. Using radiographs to assess the relationship be- tween the hoof and the underlying osseous struc-tures as an aid in assessing foot balance is aboutdeveloping an understanding of the relationshipsbetween the position of the hoof capsule, the angle ofthe distal phalanx within the hoof capsule, the sym-metry of the interphalangeal articulations, and thealignment of the phalanges. 6. Conclusions Hoof imbalance of the rear hooves should be consid-ered as important as hoof imbalance of the fronthooves. Although the imbalances may not causespecic hoof pain they very likely increase the like-lihood of lameness farther up the limb. Assess-ment by radiography is essentially the same as theforeleg. But visual identication is different giventhat the front leg and rear leg move differently.

Introduction Transportation of sport horses increases their sus-ceptibility to infectious diseases. Before, caretak-ers relied on rectal temperature together with theirclinical impression to detect travel sickness. Thisstudy's aim was to assess and compare serum amy-loid A (SAA) against rectal temperature as an indi-cator of early inflammation in sport horses aftertraveling by air. Furthermore, the optimal time tomeasure SAA was determined. 2. Materials and Methods One hundred twenty-one Warmblood horses werefollowed during the Longine Global ChampionsTour 2016 to three destinations where the horsesflew to compete. Clinical health checks and SAAmeasurements were taken at four different timepoints: prior to flying, upon arrival (0 hours), 24hours post-arrival, and 48 hours post-arrival.SAA was tested using a stall-side lateral flow im-munoassay. Rectal temperature was measuredtwice a day using a commercially available digitalthermometer. 3. Results Using a cutoff value of 35 ug/mL SAA, 97.1% sensi-tivity and 97.2% specicity was achieved in correctlydistinguishing between clinically normal and abnor-mal horses at 24 hours. Positive and negative pre-dictive values were found to be 89.5% and 99.3%,respectively. Conversely, only 2.9% sensitivity wasobserved using rectal temperature. 4.

Introduction The risk of anesthesia and surgery are greater inthe horse than in other domestic species with re-ported incidences of mortality ranging from 0.12-1.6% when elective and emergency surgeries areincluded. 1-3The source of this increased risk has many components including temperament, the cardio-pulmonary changes associated with anesthesia andrecumbency (particularly dorsal recumbency), and thehorse's apparent need to rise to stand shortly afterthe end of anesthesia. 1,2Pregnancy may exacerbate the cardiopulmonary changes that occur during anes-thesia because of decreases in cardiovascular and re-spiratory reserve as the fetus increases in size,especially as the pregnancy nears term. Thesechanges have the potential to affect both the viabil-ity of the mare and the fetus. 4No large, multi- center study has been undertaken to establish therisk to maintenance of pregnancy in the mare im-posed by general anesthesia for elective surgery.Reported foaling rates for pregnant mares experi-encing medical and surgical colic episodes providesome evidence of the risk of anesthesia with foalingrates ranging from 53.8-80% depending on thestage of gestation at the time of colic, whether thecolic was medical or surgical, and the degree of car-diopulmonary depression that occurred during theanesthetic period. 5-8The purpose of this paper is to provide context for the equine veterinarian whenadvising clients on the scheduling nonemergent sur-gery, such as wound revision or cutaneous massremoval, in the pregnant mare. 2. What We KnowPregnancy in the Mare Gestation in the mare lasts on average 320-370days. 9The conceptus enters the uterus approxi- mately 6-7 days post ovulation and moves through-out the uterine lumen until day 15-17 when xationoccurs. 10-12The initial support of early pregnancy in the mare is through progesterone, produced bythe corpus luteum formed from the initial ovulation.At approximately 35 days of gestation the endome-trial cups (from the chorionic girdle of the conceptus)form at the base of the pregnant horn and driveformation of accessory corpora lutea, providingadditional placental progestogens maintain preg-nancy. 9,13Studies evaluating removal of ovarian progesterone have determined that pregnancy in themare is luteal dependent until approximately 70days but AND NOTESmaintain the pregnancy from approximately 100days until term. 13The pregnant uterus enlarges dramatically throughout gestation and the fetus anduterus drop below the pelvic brim at approximately90-110 days of gestation. The majority of fetalgrowth occurs in the nal 3 months of gestation (day220 to foaling) at which point the mare's abdomenusually becomes noticeably distended. As themare's abdomen is expanding, the foal takes up anincreasingly larger amount of space growing at ap-proximately 1 kilogram every 2 days. The mare is relatively fertile compared with some other domestic species such as cattle with per-cycle15-day pregnancy rates reported between 64% and80%. 9,14Live foaling rate in Thoroughbred mares in Central Kentucky has been reported to range from62% to 87%. 14,15Factors that have been reported to affect the mare's ability to produce a live foalinclude increasing age, parity, reproductive status,and time bred from foaling. 9,14In the several stud - ies examining when pregnancy loss occurs, expectedloss rates are estimated at 20% from 15 days toterm, and 10-12% from day 40 of gestation to term.It is believed that this increased loss prior to 40 daysof gestation is due to increased sensitivity of theconceptus to teratogens, insult, and physiologicstressors that could cause luteal insufciency. Effects of Pregnancy on Anesthesia Little is known about the effect of pregnancy on thecardiopulmonary physiology of the mare. 16Early in pregnancy in women, tidal volume and respira-tory minute ventilation increase. Residual respira-tory volume (the amount of air remaining in thelungs at the end of expiration) decreases by 20% inpregnant women near term, reducing their respira-tory reserve. 17Similar changes would be expected in anesthetized pregnant mares in late gestation,particularly when they are positioned in dorsal re-cumbency. Hormonal changes may have some ef-fect as well. Rabbits administered progesteronerequire smaller doses of inhalant anesthetics to pro-duce anesthesia and women become more sensitiveto the effects of local anesthetics when pregnant. 18 Effects of Sedation on Pregnancy The majority of anesthetic agents are lipophilic,thus drugs administered to the mare are rapidlytransmitted to the fetus. Xylazine, detomidine,and romidine increase the duration of oxytocin- induced intrauterine pressure waves in normal,nonpregnant mares but acepromazine seemed tohave little effect. 19,20Xylazine increases intrauter - ine pressure in pregnant cows.21Detomidine was administered weekly to 10 pregnant mares fromday 14 to day 60 of gestation and monthly fromthen on to term. 22One mare aborted at 167 days and another was euthanatized due to torsion ofthe large colon. Two of the eight foals carried toterm had abnormalities (torticollis or bilateral up-ward xation of the patella) but the authors con-cluded that there was no specic adverse effect ofthe detomidine. Effects of Anesthesia on Pregnancy All known anesthetic techniques have the poten-tial to decrease cardiac output, depress arterialpressures, and cause respiratory depression, po-tentially leading to fetal acidosis, hypoxia, andhypercarbia. No extensive clinical studies of theeffect of anesthesia on pregnant mares have beenperformed, thus we are left to infer risk fromexperimental studies and from retrospective stud-ies of mares anesthetized on an emergency basis.The largest retrospective study of anestheticmorbidity and mortality in horses showed thatmares in the third trimester of pregnancy were atincreased risk with two of 16 mares dying ofanesthetic-related complications. 1 In an interesting series of papers, Taylor et al23-25 used three different combinations of anestheticdrugs to anesthetize ponies for implantation of cath-eters to study fetal metabolism. One trial usedacepromazine, butorphanol and examined the use of detomidine, ketamine, guaifenesin.24The third study with a gas mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (used tocontrol the fraction of inspired oxygen) was usedto support ventilation in all three studies. Theauthors noted less fetal acidosis and hypoxemiawhen the intravenous agents were used instead ofthe inhalant, suggesting that uterine and fetalperfusion were better with the infusion than withthe inhalant. The authors felt that fetal perfu-sion was better maintained with the guaifenesin-based technique than the other two techniques butdirect comparisons could not be made. At least four studies have examined the effect of colic and surgery for abdominal exploration of mareswith colic on subsequent foaling rates. Foalingrates for pregnant and 5-8Potential hypotension,intraoperative hypoxia, and but the results were not consistent across thereports. One study examined the relationship be-tween the timing of the colic surgery and gestationalage, nding that mares pregnant 16-39 days at thetime of surgery had a lower foaling rate than marespregnant for greater than 40 days at surgery. 8 3. Recommendations There is little to no direct evidence on which toestablish the risk of fetal loss in the normal preg-nant mare undergoing elective surgery with generalanesthesia. Reports of fetal loss in mares anesthe-tized for surgical correction of colic suggest some 464 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBROODMARES, BONES, AND BRAWNreduction in live-foal Our reading of theavailable literature suggests that anesthesia per-formed at least 40 days after breeding should besafer for the foal than anesthesia earlier in the preg-nancy. 8Placental attachment increases up to 150 days of pregnancy, potentially further reducing riskby optimizing oxygenation. The period of rapid fe-tal growth occurs after day 220 of pregnancy sug-gesting that anesthesia for elective surgery mightbest be performed prior to this time. Thus our rec-ommendation is to anesthetize mares for requiredelective surgery a minimum of 40 days after concep-tion and prior to day 220 of pregnancy. Oxygen-ation and ventilation should be supported bydelivering increased inspired concentrations of oxy-gen and controlling ventilation to maximize mater-nal and fetal oxygenation and minimize maternaland fetal hypercarbia. Arterial blood pressuresshould be monitored directly and measures taken tomaintain mean arterial blood pressure in excess of70 mm Hg to support uterine perfusion. Nonsteroi-dal anti-inflammatory drugs and progestagen sup-plementation should be provided, particularly if themare must undergo surgery prior to 40 days duringthe period of luteal dependency in the chance thatprostaglandin release associated with the procedurewould cause luteolysis.

Nonsurgical andretrograde treatment for oviductal blockage may bean attractive alternative for current treatmentmethods. The purpose of this study was to evalu-ate hysteroscopic selective hydrotubation as a treat-ment option for presumptive oviductalblockage. 2. Materials and Methods Ten milliliters of saline was flushed retrogradethrough the oviducts in 28 standing sedated maresthat had reproductive histories of unexplained sub-fertility by inserting a catheter into the uterotubaljunction under endoscopic guidance. The catheterwas a 200-cm polyethylene tube (1.7 mm outer di-ameter) that had a 22-G 1.75-in. injection catheterattached at one end and a guidewire for humanangiography (0.46 mm diameter, 220 cm long,TERUMO RF-GA18263) was inserted into the cath-eter. All mares in the study were mated throughseveral cycles (2-20 estrus cycles) by known fertilestallions prior to treatment, with no evidence ofconception. The average number of cycles for eachmare prior to treatment was 6.5 /H110064.5. 3. Results Saline was successfully infused into a total of 50oviducts. Twenty-six of 28 mares conceived afterthe treatment. The average number of cycles foreach mare to become pregnant after treatment was1.8/H110060.8. 4.

Introduction Recent reports of adverse uterine health effects fromprolonged intrauterine placement of uterine glassballs (marbles) 1-4prompted a commentary in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Associ-ation that advocated the retirement of such devices to keep mares out of heat. 5However, many mares still have intrauterine marbles and marbles are stillcommonly used in practice. Intrauterine marbleshave low efcacy in the suppression of estrus 5-7 compared with other methods9-11and there are re- ports of complications such as endometritis, pyome-tra, and infertility associated with their use. 1-4 The marbles used in an intrauterine fashion aremost commonly either 25 mm (small) or 35 mm(large) in diameter. 6Spontaneous loss of intra- uterine marbles has been reported,6which is one reason for their ineffectiveness. Marbles that areretained may however also be ineffective in pro-longing the luteal phase in many mares. 5-7The heavier weight of larger marbles may contribute tothe difculty in removing them, because marbles areoften located in the most ventral portion of theuterus. This ventral position of a marble in a marewith a dependent, pendulous uterus poses a chal-lenge because the marble must be moved up againstgravity in order to retrieve it. 9In the authors' ex- perience, large heavy marbles may be undetectedduring a transrectal ultrasound examination, par-ticularly if the ultrasound probe is positioned on thedorsal rather than ventral surface of the uterus.Because marbles may remain unidentied, secondand sometimes third marbles are placed in themare's uterus. 1 Other foreign objects that have been reported in the uterus include fetal bones,8broken endometrial AAEP caps,12and glass shards from marbles.1The aforementioned foreign objects have been associated with complications such as pyome-tra, 1,3adhesions,1failure to cycle,6,7chronic endo - metritis,1infertility,1and abortions.4Therefore, their timely removal is imperative if uterine healthand fertility is to be maintained. It has been re-ported that uterine foreign bodies may be recoveredby gentle manual manipulation or with the assis-tance of hysteroscopy. 8,12A detailed description of foreign-body removal using videohysteroscopy andendoscopic tools is lacking. 2. Materials and MethodsHistory Owners may request an examination of a mare thathad previously had a marble inserted into heruterus because they observe her in estrus, and theyassume that the marble has been lost; however, thismost often is not the case. 1In other foreign-body cases the presenting complaint may include failureto cycle, vaginal discharge, or the retrieval of abnor-mal material such as glass during uterine lavage. 1-3 Rectal and Ultrasound Examination Regarding intrauterine marbles, palpation of theuterus and a transrectal ultrasound examinationwill usually reveal the marble's presence. In a non-pendulous uterus intrauterine marbles are readilydetected. However, careful transrectal ultrasoundexamination is imperative in mares with a pendu-lous uterus. In such cases, the authors recommendthat the transrectal ultrasound be performed withthe ultrasound probe positioned on the ventral as-pect of the uterus, given that heavier marbles aremore commonly missed if a dorsal-to-ventral view ofthe uterus is performed. Marbles may be peduncu-lated and encased in a pocket of uterine tissue,which is positioned away from the main portion ofthe uterus (Fig. 1). During transrectal palpation,the examiner should determine whether the marblemay be moved within the uterus. Mapping of the location and estimated size of the uterine foreign object(s) is advised. Foreign objectssuch as marbles, glass shards, and broken endome-trial swab ends and tips are characteristically hy-perechogenic and usually cause acoustic shadows(Fig. 2). 1Hyperechogenic areas on ultrasound should be differentiated from air in the uterus.If multiple small areas of hyperechogenicity arenoted, their location and depth in the uterus shouldbe recorded. Mapping the structures in the uteruswill aid in identication of these during followupexaminations or when recovery of such objects re-quires more than one attempt. The presence oflarge amounts of echogenic intrauterine fluid willimpair a complete evaluation of the contents of theuterus and fluid evacuation by routine uterine la-vage should be performed prior to a foreign-bodyrecovery attempt. Preparation of the Mare Following transrectal palpation and ultrasound, themare's tail is wrapped and perineum is thoroughlywashed with gentle soap. It is advisable to sedatethe mare if manual extraction will take longer than20 minutes or if hysteroscopy will be used. A com- bination of an alpha agonist and butorphanol ad-ministered intravenously is commonly used forsafety, to prevent straining, and to keep marescomfortable during manipulation. Foreign-bodyextraction can be accomplished by 1) manual ma- Fig. 1.

Manual Removal of Foreign Bodies Recently, broken swab tips are usually located inthe uterus just ahead of the internal cervical os,and retrieval should be attempted using a tran-scervical approach. The mare's perineum shouldbe cleansed and her tail wrapped. The examinershould use a sterile lubricated rectal sleeve and thehand is introduced into the vagina and the ngertipsare passed through the cervix. Digital palpationaround the internal os of the cervix is performed toidentify the swab ends or tip. Removal of the bro-ken swab pieces may be facilitated by gentle dilationof the cervix to allow the introduction of two ngers,or a nger may be placed cranial to the swab tip andthe tip manipulated backward through the canal.If this manual extraction fails, a routine uterinelavage with saline or lactated Ringers solution via abivona catheter amay be performed to remove small pieces. A cytology and aerobic culture of this intra-uterine fluid may be indicated. The retrieved uter-ine fluid is visually inspected for the missing brokenrod pieces or swab tip. Multiple fragments of the rod or swab tip may be present and may not be accessible using manualremoval. If the broken ends remain in the uterusfor more than 24 hours substantial endometrial in-flammation results. Therefore, in a diestrus marewith a piece for a culture rod or swab foreign body inthe uterus it is not advisable to have a lengthy delayin retrieving the pieces, and unlike a mare with amarble, it is not necessary to wait for the mare tocome into estrus. Immediate retrieval of these for-eign objects is desirable. It has been reported thatfetal bones, 8swab tips,12or glass shards1that have been retained in the uterus for long periods of timemay be adhered to or embedded in the endometriumand hysteroscopy may be required to visualize them.Endometrial biopsy forceps inserted through thecervix adjacent to the videohysteroscope have beenreported as a means to grasp foreign bodies underdirect visualization. This is a fast and atraumaticmeans of retrieving swab or broken rod foreignbodies. 12,13 Prior to large foreign-body retrieval such as a marble, it is advisable to plan the retrieval when themare is in late estrus or to induce estrus using theadministration of prostaglandin F 2/H9251. Marble ex - traction is more readily and easily achieved whenthe mare is in estrus because the cervix is softer andmore easily dilated. In cases where removal is at-tempted in a mare with a long, tortuous or broticcervix, Prostaglandin E2 b(0.5 mg) cream, or Pros - taglandin E1c(Misprostil, 200 micrograms) tablets may be ground into a powder and mixed into 3 to 5mL of sterile aqueous lubricant d, which is then ap - plied onto and into the cervical canal from 4 to 24hours prior to manipulation. Prostaglandin E in-duces a neutrophil influx; therefore, some cervicaldischarge may be present. 14Mares may also be administered 10 mg estradiol 17- /H9252intramuscularly 24 hours prior to retrieval during estrus to facilitaterelaxation of the cervix, particularly if the mare isinduced into estrus using prostaglandin F2- /H9251, be- cause these mares may have lower estrogen levels.15 It is also recommended that N-butylscopolaminebromide e(0.3 mg/kg, IV) is administered to induce rectal relaxation prior to uterine manipulation. For manual extraction, a sterile gloved hand is used to evaluate the cervix for dilation. If two ormore ngers can be advanced through the cervix andthe marble is felt with the ngertips, the marbleshould be grasped and patiently removed. If themarble is unable to be felt with the ngertips orthe cervix is not dilated enough to allow two to threengers introduced, the examiner should manipulatethe marble caudally using a rectal approach andattempt to push the marble out of the uterusthrough the cervix and into the vagina where agloved hand is used to retrieve the marble. Inmares with a pendulous uterus, multiple attemptsmay be required during a session to retrieve themarble. A two-armed approach is sometimes re-quired in which the examiner uses a transrectalapproach to position the marble as close as possibleto the cervix and maintains it in that position withone hand while the other sterile hand is placed inthe vagina and the ngertips are used to graspthe marble and manipulate it through the cervix.Careful rectal manipulation is warranted due to therisk of rectal injury. The use of sedation and N-butylscopolamine bromide e(0.3 mg/kg, IV) is advis As the two-armed approach to marbleretrieval is difcult, hazardous to the mare, and maynot be effective, hysteroscopic retrieval is preferablein these cases. Hysteroscopic Retrieval of Foreign Bodies The mare's tail is wrapped and her perineum iscleansed. Two operators are required. One oper-ator wears a sterile rectal sleeve and surgical glove,they pass the scope through the cervix, position thevideohysteroscope in the uterus, and hold the cervixtightly closed around the scope. The second personoperates the controls of the videohysteroscope andpasses and operates endoscopic tools. Before be-ginning the functional capacity of the videohystero-scopic equipment to insufflate the uterus, theequipment should be evaluated prior to the proce-dure by attempting to insufflate a sterile rectalsleeve using 20 seconds of insufflation with CO 2or air. If insufflation of the rectal sleeve is notachieved in 20 seconds then an external flow regu-lated insufflation source fshould be used to add sup - plemental air flow through the biopsy channel.Good uterine insufflation is necessary to minimizethe time needed for the procedure, to fully visualizethe uterine body and horns, and to locate the foreignbody. Failure to easily visualize the interior of theuterus is almost always related to poor insufflation. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 471BROODMARES, BONES, AND is of the utmostimportance. In the authors' experience, insuffla-tion works better for retrieval of a foreign body com-pared with using fluid to achieve uterine distensionas there is one less resistance impedance when ma-nipulating endoscopic tools and foreign objects.Fractured or adhered marbles that have been in amare's uterus for a prolonged time, swab tips, orglass shards embedded in the endometrium are bet-ter evaluated and removed with the aid of a video-hysteroscope. For videohysteroscopy, a 1.6-m-longvideo gastroscope or hysteroscope gwith tools such as flex-ible baskets snares or tk;4guided wire device areused (Fig. 3). Upon identication of the foreignbody, an appropriate endoscopic tool should bepassed through the portal of the scope. Swab tips and broken rod pieces can be removed by passing an endometrial biopsy forceps hinto the eld of view alongside the videohysteroscope andthen grasping the pieces under direct visualizationwith the biopsy forceps h, or through the use of an ellipsoid cup forcepsi(Fig. 4 ), a pelican grasperj(Fig. 3, A and B), or a four-prong grasperk(Fig. 3, C and D). Other tools used for foreign-body retrieval in-clude flexible oval loop snare l, jumbo oval grabber snarem(Fig. 3), four-wire basket retrievern, and an - gular basketothat have multiple size options and should be chosen according to the size and type ofobject to be grasped. Recalcitrant adhered marbles may be dislodged by gentle massage per-rectum prior to videohysteos-copy. When manual retrieval of a marble is unsuc-cessful, the marble may be retrieved using avideohysteroscope gand endoscopic tools such as a flexible four-wire basket retrievern, angular basketo, flexible oval loop snarel(Fig. 3, E and F), or a jumbo oval grabber snarem(Fig. 3, G and H). Intact large marbles are most easily removed with a jumbo ovalgrabber snare m(Fig. 5 ) or a large flexible angular basket retrievero, whereas small marbles are more easily removed with a smaller flexible four-wire bas- Fig. 3.

The basket device is easier to manipulate and secure on top ofthe marble for its removal. Briefly, the videoendo-scope is positioned with the marble in view. A flex-ible basket snare device is placed through the biopsyport of the videohysteroscope in the collapsed(closed) position and passed into the eld of view.The basket is then opened and the open device isadvanced and positioned on top of the marble toencircle it. If placement of the basket is successful,the device should be gently closed to allow the bas-ket to be secured tightly around the marble. Theflexible basket snare is pulled back to allow themarble within the basket to be held against the tipof the videohysteroscope. The videohysteroscopeshould be pulled backward into the operator's handin the vagina so the retrieved marble and videohys-teroscope are removed in a controlled fashion fromthe uterus and vagina. The flexible basket devicemay also be used to retrieve the glass pieces or tomanipulate degenerating glass marbles into smallerchunks. Another endoscopic tool that may be usedis the flexible oval loop snare mor a jumbo oval grab - ber snaren. However, this tool requires more dex - terity when placing the wire loop securely aroundthe marble, given that it easily slides off of themarble's surface. The flexible wire loop is used as a snare and is introduced into the biopsy port ofthe videohysteroscope as previously described forthe basket. The wire loop is passed until it isin the eld of view. The wire loop is positioned onthe dorsal aspect of the marble and the loop istted around the middle of the marble, the wireloop is gently and slowly closed around the mar-ble, until the loop is tightly secured around themarble to avoid it sliding off. The videohystero-scope and the marble are then slowly removedtogether from the uterus. Glass shards that are adhered to the endome- trium pose a difcult challenge as there may bemyriad fragments. Removal may be attempted un-der direct visualization by passing an ellipsoid cupforceps itool through the biopsy portal and graspingthe embedded pieces, or through an endometrialbiopsy instrument hplaced alongside the hystero - scope. The endometrial biopsy instrument, how-ever, often causes bleeding, which may obscure anyfurther fragment removal attempts, and thus isonly suitable for cases with a few glass fragments.Chemical curettage of the endometrium may be at-tempted in cases with large numbers of embeddedfragment; however, the success of this as a therapyremains unknown. Post Procedure After foreign-body retrieval is completed the uterusshould be re-examined with the scope to determine ifthere is any damage to the uterus such as adhesions,presence of a biolm, and if there are any otherabnormalities. The airflow is then discontinuedand the biopsy port of the videohysteroscope isopened to allow the uterus to deflate. Finally, auterine lavage is performed and other therapies maybe administered to aid in removing any iatrogeniccontamination, infection, and to treat inflammation.In some cases of retained marbles, videohysteros-copy revealed a biolm on the endometrium. Addi-tional treatment for endometritis may be required.In cases where glass shards are present ne piecesmay be removed through uterine lavage. An endo-metrial biopsy may be warranted for prognostic pur-pose under hysteroscopic visualization to evaluateendometrial health in a subsequent cycle. 3. Results All mares referred for endometrial swab tip removalin three referral clinics have successfully had theforeign body material retrieved either manually,through uterine lavage, or through videohysteros-copy. Fertility of those mares is generally not af-fected. Hysteroscopy is generally performed forswab or rod retrieval only in cases where multiplepieces are present, if the broken endometrial swab islodged in the endometrium, or if the cervix is toolong, brotic or tortuous to allow manual retrieval.Mares with a nonpendulous uterus and with a pat-ent pliable cervix may easily have marbles removedmanually. However, mares with long, brotic, ortortuous cervix or that have a pendulous uterus mayhave the intrauterine marbles removed easier andless traumatically with the aid of a videohystero-scope and endoscopic tools. Mares with glassshards from broken marbles can have the luminaland supercial glass pieces removed from the endo-metrium; however, tiny ne glass shards that areembedded into the deeper layers of the uterus can-not be removed and these may impair the mare'sfertility. 4. Discussion Manual removal of broken endometrial swab tipsare more easily accomplished when the cervix is softand easily dilated, and in most cases the endome-trial swab tips are located just ahead of the internal Fig. 5. Videohysteroscopic images of two marbles in a mare'suterus and a flexible wire loop which is shown being used for theirretrieval. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 473BROODMARES, BONES, AND BRAWNcervical os. Broken culture rods and swabs mayarise due to poor storage or handling of the cultureswabs, inopportune movement of the mare, faultymanufacturing, or operator error. The most com-mon errors with double-guarded swabs include in-serting the culture swab too far and deep in theuterine body so that there is insufcient space toadvance the other parts; and when advancement ofthe inner sheath and swab are forced, the rodbreaks; not stabilizing the swab near the cervix byfailing to hold the outer sheath steady in the vaginabefore advancing the inner sheath and swab por-tions; or the retraction of the innermost rod prior tothe retraction of the interior sheath. For the ma-jority of retrievals of broken rods and swabs no spe-cial equipment is needed and in most cases light tono sedation is necessary. Uterine lavage is alsoeffective in many of cases. We have also experi-enced a batch of swabs where the cotton tips wereoften left in the uterus, which we believed was due tofaulty manufacturing. There are some mares withextremely problematic cervices that require exces-sive bending of the swab to gain entrance to theuterus that then compromises the mechanical integ-rity of the swab. There are thus a few cases thatmay require videohysteroscopy assistance to re-trieve the various foreign bodies. This is preferableto traumatizing the cervix and uterus through re-peated unsuccessful retrieval attempts. The disad-vantage of videohysteroscopic procedure is the costand the need for specialized equipment such as thevideoendoscope, a biopsy forceps, or the endoscopictools, such as wire baskets, wire loops, and gasperdevices. The major challenge currently is the com-plete removal of embedded glass shards, which aremost likely to permanently affect fertility. Marbles are not medically approved devices and there are a growing number of reports on the unin-tended consequences of long-term use including en-dometritis, pyometra, and infertility. 1-4If marbles were medical devices it is highly likely that therewould have been a recall. The composition of themarble may also be important, as glass-colored mar-bles, normally available commercially for recre-ational purposes, should be particularly targeted forremoval. Glass is a porous material and it de-grades over time. Borosilicate glass marbles maybe more durable; however, a recent examination of aborosilicate glass marble showed surface changesafter a 2-year insertion period (Fig. 6). Becausemarbles are nonmedical devices, are poorly efca-cious in preventing estrus, and have led to seriouscomplications, their use should not be recom-mended, and the removal of marbles should be apriority. The method used to detect the presence of marbles is important. Experienced practitioners may notdetect the presence of a marble in a mare with adependent pendulous uterus, and in this article wedescribe how a marble may be pedunculated (Fig. 1)and found encased in uterine tissue on a stalk,which explains the challenge of marble detection. There is a paucity of information on the frequency of problematic marble retrieval, sometimes referredto as a marble dystocia. Difcult retrieval is in ourexperience associated with a dependent uterine lo-cation, adhered marbles, or may occur in mares witha brotic, or long, tortuous cervix, the length ofwhich exceeds the length of the operator's nger.The use of both arms for retrieval of marbles fromthe uterus is difcult, challenging, and dangerous.This is due to the heavy weight of the uterus and theheavier weight of the marble, which is often lodgedin the most pendulous part of the uterine body,ventral to the cervix, making gravity an additionalchallenge for expulsion of the marble. The use ofvideohysteroscopy is warranted in these cases.Smaller marbles can be successfully and more eas-ily removed through a wire-basket device than theloop, and are more easily removed through a cer-vix that fails to dilate properly. Large marblesusually require the wire loop, wire device or largebaskets. Both types of wire devices are found incommon use in small-animal referral practices forforeign-body retrieval. Successful retrieval of de-vices through videohysteroscopy and endoscopictools requires sedation, specialized equipment,and trained personnel. Conclusion Foreign-body material may be manually removed orremoved using videohysteroscopy and endoscopictools. Marbles are nonmedical devices and their in-trauterine use should be discontinued. The failureto identify and remove foreign bodies includingmarbles(s) from the uterine environment may leadto impaired fertility in mares. Fig. 6.

We hypothesized that repairedhumeral fractures would have a favorable prognosisfor survival and future athletic performance. 2. Materials and Methods Medical records of horses less than 1 year of age,with humeral fractures repaired from 1989 to 2013were reviewed. Long-term follow up was obtainedthrough follow-up examination and/or telephonecommunication. 3. Results Twenty-ve patients, aged 1 week to 9 months(mean, 4 months), and weighing 68 to 295 kg ( mean, 177 kg) were repaired with an IIN. Fifteen pa-tients, aged 2 to 12 months (mean, 6 months), and weighing 113 to 377 kg (mean, 242 kg) were repairedwith an IIN in combination with a bone plate (IIN-P). Twenty-six patients were Quarter Horses.Remaining breeds included Thoroughbred (4), Appa-loosa (3), Paint (3), Mixed (3), and Arabian (1).Overall, 29 patients (73%) survived to discharge.Long-term follow up on 27 patients documented 25patients (93%) were able to perform their intendeduse as adults. 4.

Pri-mary closure castration or use of a transxationligature alone to prevent evisceration have beenrecommended. 2. Materials and Methods We hypothesized that using braided suture materialfor transxation under eld conditions would notincrease postoperative complications compared witha closed eld castration technique without suture ora primary closure castration approach in a hospitalsetting (30 horses in each group). The following information was collected: age, breed, surgeon, position in surgery, volume of lido-caine injected into the testicle, medications used,surgery time in minutes, recovery score from anes-thesia, and suture used. Follow-up postoperativeinformation was obtained by The proportion of postoperative complications was3.3% of the overall study population, and did notdiffer statistically between the three groups. Thetype of suture used (braided, monolament, or nosuture) did not influence signicantly the occurrenceof postoperative complications in this study. 4. Conclusion Using a multilament, transxing ligature for rou-tine closed-eld castration does postoperative complications, when comparedwith a closed-castration technique without ligatureplacement or a primary closure castration techniquein a hospital setting.

However,the benets of conditioning horses using WTs arenot documented. Therefore, the purpose of thisstudy was to test the effect of an 18-day WT-conditioning program on maximal oxygen con-sumption (V O 2max). 2. Materials and Methods Nine unt Thoroughbreds were used in a random-ized, controlled trial. Pre- and post-conditioningmaximal-exercise racetrack tests were performedusing a portable ergospirometry system. Mea-sured outcomes were V O 2, spirometry, heart rate,blood lactate, and speed. Six horses worked dailyin water at stifle height (water treadmill group-WT) for 18 days. The three control horses workedwithout water (dry treadmill [DT] group). 3. Results The workload assessed by V O2was 21.7% greater in the WT than in the DT conditions. V O2max on the racetrack increased signicantly by 16.1%from pre- to post-conditioning in the WT horses(P/H11005.03). There was no difference in maximum heart rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, re-spiratory frequency, lactate, and maximum speedduring the maximal exercise tests pre- and post-conditioning. Average speed over the distance ofthe maximal exercise test increased by 17.4% 479BROODMARES, BONES, AND BRAWN Research Abstract /L50093for more information, contact the corresponding author NOTES4.

Introduction Endurance riding is an international, long-dis-tance equestrian sport that in North America hasbeen overseen by the American Endurance RidingConference (AERC) since 1972. The Fe \u00b4de\u00b4ration Equestre Internationale (FEI) has been regulatinginternational events since 1982. Since then, thenumber of entries in endurance events worldwidehas increased more than four-fold and between2007 and 2015 the number of endurance eventshas nearly doubled (FEI Endurance Report,2016). 1Endurance events (ranging from 50 to 100 miles, or 80 to 160 km in total distance) aresplit into successive phases of approximately 15 to20 miles. At the end of each phase, horses arestopped for a veterinary inspection. Heart rate,hydration status, presence of gut sounds, and gaitare the primary criteria evaluated at the veteri-nary check to determine whether the horse is t tocontinue. Any horse deemed unt to continue(due to lameness or excessive fatigue, for example)is immediately withdrawn from the event. Lameness, dehydration, and metabolic disor- ders are the main causes of elimination in 160-kmevents. 2-4Elimination rates in endurance events vary from one geographical area to another.3For ex-ample, eliminations for metabolic disorders occur morefrequently in hot and humid areas. However, lame-ness remains the most common cause of elimination inall countries. 4A recent study of 30,741 horse starts in FEI endurance events found that the mean elimi-nation rate was 49%, primarily due to lameness (30%)and metabolic reasons (9%). 4AERC records show that the completion rate for 50- and 100-mile events inthe United States between 1996 and 2016 has been84% to 87%. Similar to what occurs on a global level,the main causes for elimination in the United Statesare lameness and metabolic disturbances. 5 A signicant number of eliminated horses ( /H1101112%) require emergency medical treatment,6and early detection and early institution of appropriate ther-apies are key to successful outcome. The two maindisease categories that require emergency medicaltreatment are exertional rhabdomyolysis and colic.Unfortunately, fatalities are recognized subsequentto prolonged endurance exercise, and between 2002and 2014 the AERC reported 71 fatalities over270,070 horse starts. 7This fatality rate of 0.26 per 1,000 starts is much lower than fatality rates re-ported for other equine sports; however, reducingfatality rates where possible will help with improv-ing equine welfare in the endurance sport. Colic AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 481BROODMARES, BONES, AND BRAWN NOTEShas been recognized as a common reason for elimi-nation from equine endurance competitions and theleading cause of mortality in this group of horsesand of the fatalities reported between 2002 and2013, 75% had signs of acute abdominal pain. 7 The leading cause of colic in the endurance horse isileus, followed by Salmonellosis and enteritis. 8 Electrolyte derangements including hypocalcemia,dehydration and lack of intestinal perfusion, andother factors are likely contributors to developmentof ileus in endurance horses. Recent reports sug-gest treating veterinarians are unaware of theunique conditions surrounding colic in endurancehorses at competitions. The goals of this report areto raise awareness of the unique aspects of treatingcolic in endurance horses at competitions and pro-vide specic recommendations for management ofcolic in this group of horses. Here we outline rec-ommendations for emergency treatment of endur-ance horses with colic with the objectives ofimproving outcomes in these horses through earlyrecognition and early aggressive treatment. 2. Materials and Methods Data from recently reported AERC case fatalitieswere reviewed. This included veterinary examina-tion ndings of the individual horses during andafter competition and veterinary records from refer-ral centers if the horse was transported for furthercare. These ndings, in combination with what hasbeen shown in previous studies of endurance horses,prompted the need to disseminate more informationpertaining to colic in endurance horses to equinepractitioners. 3. Results 1. Veterinary examination: Endurance horses with gastrointestinal upset may show severesigns of colic but often do not have a signi-cantly elevated heart rate to match the signsof pain. Heart rates of 50 to 65 beats perminute are common in painful animals. 2. Nasogastric intubation: A nasogastric tube should be placed to determine whether thereis reflux. It is not uncommon for there to beno reflux on initial examination; however,with ongoing disease gastric lling may de-velop later. A nasogastric tube should be leftin place in horses that are transported. 3. Although examination per rectum is an im- portant part of our gastrointestinal evalua-tion, it is not recommended to subjectendurance horses with colic to this procedureon rst evaluation. Arabian horses are atincreased risk for rectal tears 9and the pres - ence of dehydration may add additionalrisk. In fact, ndings of examination per rec-tum are often predictable: ndings are oftenunremarkable, or reveal the presence of drymanure and/or intestinal distention. If ul-trasound is available abdominal ultrasoundmay provide useful information with regard tostomach size, small intestinal luminal size,and gastrointestinal motility. 4. Fluid resuscitation: Horses should be fluid resuscitated early and aggressively. Fluidresuscitation should be initiated immediatelyafter veterinary or owner recognition of abnor-malities during competition or during recov-ery. Abnormalities may include overt signsof colic, but may also include persistently ele-vated heart rate (/H1102260 beats per minute morethan 20 minutes after stopping the exercise)and anorexia. An average-sized endurancehorse (450 kg) should be administered 20 L ofbalanced electrolyte solution intravenouslywithin 1 hour. Horses that have evidence ofgastrointestinal disease or are suspected tohave gastrointestinal disease should not beadministered intragastric fluids. 5. Restraint: If the horse is showing signs of discomfort, the horse should be calmed downusing appropriate doses of sedatives includ-ing xylazine and detomidine. Butorphanolcan be included with these drugs. Non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not beused at this stage because of the nephrotoxicproperties of these drugs, in particular in horsesthat have gastrointestinal damage or are vol-ume depleted. 10 6. Monitoring: The following laboratory pa- rameters are useful for decision making re-garding further cell volume(PCV), management: If the horse is con- sidered to need further care based on clinicalndings or disease processes diagnosed, optionsfor referral should be investigated. If the horseneeds to travel to a location more than 45 min-utes away, the horse should receive another 20L balanced electrolyte solution intravenouslyprior to transportation. At this time, the horseshould be checked again for development of re-flux or the nasogastric tube should be left inplace. The horse should not be transportedwithout a nasogastric tube in place. Thesehorses may require administration of 60 to 90 Lintravenous balanced electrolyte solution per 24hours. Horses should receive nothing per os. 8. Common causes for colic in endurance horses are ileus and enteritis. In addition, large co-lon impactions and gastric ulcers have beenidentied as causes for colic. Although it isvery uncommon to nd surgical lesions in thisgroup of horses, there are those that developcolonic displacements or small intestinalstrangulating lesions. 8Ancillary diagnostics that may be helpful to distinguish betweensurgical and nonsurgical lesions include ab- 482 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSBROODMARES, BONES, AND BRAWNdominal ultrasound and peritoneal fluid anal-ysis. Specically, evaluation of peritonealtotal protein and peritoneal lactate concentra-tion compared with peripheral blood lactatecan be helpful with this decision. 4. Discussion AERC data and other studies suggest that ileus is afrequently made diagnosis in endurance horses thatdie as a result of acute abdominal disease. Oneprevious study has shown that ileus and enteritisare the leading causes of colic in endurance horses atcompetitions. 8In reviewing AERC fatalities it was discovered that there was improvement possiblewith respect to treating and managing horses withcolic at competitions. Specic aspects that werenoticed that could result in reducing fatalities wereadministering sufcient fluids intravenously, plac-ing a nasogastric tube, avoiding examinations perrectum, and taking extra care when considering ab-dominal surgery. Fielding and Dechant 8showed in their study that 14% of horses underwent explor-atory laparotomy, and surgical ndings in included perforated gastric intes-tinal ileus with associated midjejunal impaction.Four of the ve horses survived. In conclusion, the main cause of colic in competing endurance horses is nonstrangulating small intesti-nal obstruction, most commonly caused by enteritisand ileus, and abdominal surgery is rarely indicatedin this group of horses. To increase survival inendurance horses treated for colic, veterinariansshould provide early aggressive fluid therapy at thesite of competition prior to transport and provideappropriate length of therapy prior to recommend-ing euthanasia. The prognosis for endurancehorses with colic is good, even if exploratory surgeryis required.Acknowledgments Declaration of EthicsThe Authors have adhered to the Principles of Veter-inary Medical Ethics of the AVMA.Conflict of InterestThe Authors have no conflicts of interest.

Unfortunately, osseous pathol-ogy of the cervical articular processes has been poorlydescribed and the prevalence of various types of osteo-phytes and enthesophytes is unknown. The objectiveof the study was to characterize and establish theprevalence of bony changes of the cervical articularprocesses in a mixed population of horses (i.e., variableages, sizes, breeds) to better capture the full spectrumof disease affecting the cervical articular processes. 2. Materials and Methods The articular processes of the cervical and rst threethoracic vertebrae (C2-T3) from 56 horses euthanizedfor reasons unrelated to neck pain were evaluated forthe presence and severity of abnormal bony changes. 3. Results Seventy-two percent of articular processes had osse-ous changes that were considered abnormal. Theprevalence of abnormal changes varied between thecranial vs mild moderate (22%), and severe(5%). 4. Discussion The clinical signicance of the described lesions isunknown, but the ndings are expected to enhancethe reporting and clinical interpretation of articularprocess and periarticular changes noted on ad-vanced diagnostic imaging of the equine cervicalspine.

Introduction The juvenile foot grows rapidly with a radical changeof shape, which reveals a unique developmental pat-tern that has not yet been fully studied. The goal ofthis study was to quantify external and internalanatomical characteristics of the foot throughout therst year of development. 2. Materials and Methods Digital radiographs and photographs were takenbimonthly of the forefeet of nine Arabian foals,beginning at 2 weeks of age until 1 year. Sixty-eight linear and angular variables were mea-sured using ImageJ software. Statistical analyseswere performed using piecewise random coef-cient model and P/H11021.05 values were considered signicant.3. Results Signicant changes in several radiographic andconformational measurements including palmarprocesses height, joint angles, phalanges/sesam-oid bones width/length, toe and heel angles, andsole/heel widths between months 4 and 8 wereidentied. 4. Discussion Diagnosis of equine foot problems early in theircourse is crucial to the overall long-term quality oflife as abnormal growth patterns can precede footdiseases and subsequent lameness.

AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 487BROODMARES, BONES, AND BRAWNThe Anatomy of a Contract: A Discussion of theMost Vital Components of a VeterinaryEmployment Agreement Ky Mortensen, JD, MBA This presentation explains the function of the veterinary employment agreement, providing a detailedanalysis of its primary components, including compensation and non-compete provisions along withpractical guidance on how to weigh the cost/benet analysis of a contract's 1. Introduction Many veterinary practices utilize employmentagreements to detail the understanding of the em-ployment arrangement between employer and em-ployee. Considering the importance of a contractand its function as a legal tool, the need to under-stand the agreement is paramount to the success ofthe relationship. Although it is best to appreciatethe language of the agreement at the outset of anemployer/employee relationship, it is never too lateto revisit the agreement and discuss its contents sothat all parties are fully aware of the level of pro-tection the contract affords as well as their owncontractual obligations. Whether you are a newgraduate looking for guidance, an associate seekingto better understand your current employmentagreement, or an employer seeking to protect yourbusiness through the use of an enforceable contract,the need for veterinarians to understand their con-tracts is vital to the growth of an individual's careerand to the health of a practice. Equal in impor-tance is the understanding that contracts, while be-ing legally binding in their nature, are the product ofhuman beings. As such, reactions to contractualissues can be met with an emotional response thatcan easily compound the problem. Of utmost im-portance in any contractual dispute is the need toconsider the real harm, understand your position,and to make an informed decision based on reason-able expectations and open communication. 2. Why Do We Need a Contract? Among the primary reasons to have an employmentagreement, the rst is to detail any complex meth-odology of employee compensation. Many practiceschoose to pay practitioners on a commission struc-ture rather than strictly on a salary basis. Thismethod of compensation incentivizes the associateto become a higher producer as their level of produc-tion is realized in their monthly paycheck. It fur-ther motivates the practitioner to effectively usehis/her time on each case, to fully charge for theirservices, to avoid discounting, and to sell profes-sional services rather than merely dispensing drugs.The complexity of a commission structured compen- 488 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICE NOTESsation, if not done correctly, can be confusing and isan area begging for a misunderstanding if notclearly dened and strictly adhered to through theuse of an employment agreement. Another important reason to have an employment agreement is to detail the parameters of any con-dentiality, non-compete, and non-solicitation provi-sions that the employer wishes to have in place toprotect their business and to avoid training theirfuture competition. The non-compete can be a de-terrent to a new employee if not understood cor-rectly. It can be also be an exercise in vanity onbehalf of the employer if not carefully evaluated forits purpose and drafted with specicity to ensure itsgreatest opportunity for enforceability. If your compensation method is strictly a yearly salary with no bonuses or commission payments andyou have no need for any condentiality protectionor a non-compete provision, you likely can cover thearrangement with a traditional job description andan agreed salary statement. 3. Compensation Compensation is the method and amount of moneythat the employer is willing to provide in exchangefor the professional contribution of the employee.Once negotiated, it is important that the under-standing between the parties be specically de-scribed within the contract. This is particularlyimportant when a commission-based pay schedule isin use. Commissions can be a driver for success ora recipe for disaster and the rst step in gettingthem right is to ensure that both parties are on thesame page with regard to how the commissionedpayments are accrued and distributed. Some prac-tices follow a general percentage-based approachwherein the employee is simply paid an overall per-centage of their gross production. Others maychoose to pay on gross collected production, meaningthe total amount of payments that were actuallyreceived in a given time period, for work that wasgenerated by a specic practitioner. A more sophis-ticated approach is to pay on the gross prots ofcollected revenues wherein a specied percentage isassigned as the compensation percentage for theprot margin of each service provided and paid asthe revenues are collected by the practice. And -nally, an even more complex methodology is to payon collected revenues, from a commissioned percent-age of gross prots, that vary in percentage based onthe type of service given or product dispensed, all ofwhich is calculated in a tiered system whereby pay-ments that are received in an earlier timeframe arepaid out in their entirety and payments that takelonger to collect are paid on a decreasing scale.This system may pay 100% of the earned commis-sion for invoices collected in a timeframe up to 90days for example, and then 75% or even 50% of theearned commission for invoices paid from 90 to 180days after time of service. These systems tend topay no commission at all on invoices that take longerthan 180 days to collect thereby incentivizing prac-titioners to collect at time of service when possible,and to avoid doing work for bad accounts. All ofthese methods can be evaluated by the employer fortheir usefulness in increasing productivity and theirfairness for rewarding veterinarians for their contri-bution to the practice. They are shared here onlyas an example of how easily a simple paycheck canbecome a confusing maze when payday arrives.This illustrates how necessary it becomes that theexact methodology of determining a rate of compen-sation be understood and accurately describedwithin the four corners of an employment contract,to avoid any misunderstanding. Of greatest importance for purposes of our dis- cussion is to rst ensure that the practice is capa-ble of calculating the compensation according to the agreed upon method, and secondly that the method-ology of calculation is defensible in court. Manypractices will rely on practice-management softwareto ensure that the calculations are correct; however,regardless of the system or method you choose, itmust be carefully described in the contract and ac-curately applied each pay period to ensure thatthere are no misunderstandings or discrepancies incompensation. Any breakdown in this area can bedevastating to the level of trust between employerand employee and can be the impetus of consider-able legal and/or nancial agony should a mistakearise. 4. Understanding Your Non-Compete andNon-Solicitation Clause On its face, a non-compete in a veterinary contractcan be an ugly sore that sticks out with its threat-ening language and its protective tone. New veter- inarians are often concerned by its limiting provisionsand without an understanding of what it reallymeans, can become less than enthusiastic about a newposition because of the unknown. Equally as prob- lematic is a veterinarian signing the non-competeagreement, assuming the provision is unenforce-able. Conversely, employers may nd a level ofcomfort in a non-compete, but that comfort may bemisleading when push comes to shove due to theemployer's oversight of several key elements thatmust exist to make a non-compete enforceable.Those elements include the following: Consideration: Whether or not something of value has been offered in exchange for the employ-ee's willingness to agree to the terms of the non-compete provision. This is best accomplished byoffering a signing bonus or something of reasonablevalue beyond simply offering the employee the job. Duration: This is the time period during which the non-compete's restrictive covenants are to be ineffect. This can range from a year up to even 5years depending on the value of the employee andthe potential threat they represent should theyopenly compete against their current employer. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 489THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICEGeographic distance: This is the distance (typi- cally a radius) surrounding your practice that is tobe \"off limits\" during the time of the non-compete.Again, depending on the type of practice, its setting,and the location of the core clientele, the geographicdistance can range from a city block up to more than100 miles. Scope of activity: This is the type of activity (pro- viding professional veterinary service) that is not tobe permitted within the restricted geographic areathroughout the duration of the non-compete. Typ-ically you would want to restrict only the type ofveterinary service that is offered at the currentemployer's practice. Anything else would not beviewed as being competitive in nature. Non-solicitation: Not to be confused with a non- solicitation agreement, the non-compete strictly pro-hibits the employee from competing against theemployer within the described area for the timeperiod agreed upon. Non-solicitation provisionsprotect the employer against open solicitation of theemployer's clients or other employees by the formeremployee after they have left employment. 5. What About Benets, Days Off, and On Call? The benets that you provide to your employees maychange over time. One year you may provide a401k match, and the next year, due to nancialconstraints, you may be unable to continue the ben-et. Employers are not required to offer retirementbenets; nor are they required to make matchingcontributions, prot sharing, or any other contribu-tion. 1However, when these benets are guaran - teed in an employment contract, the practices' handsbecome tied and you are contractually bound to con-tinue the benet at the guaranteed level for theduration of the contract term. Absent an agree-ment that runs to the benet of the employees (suchas an employment agreement), employers are gen-erally able to change employer-sponsored insurancepolicy at any time, with or without permission ofemployees. 2When the benets are left at the dis - cretion of the employer, you are in a much betterposition to respond to changes in your practice'snancial situation from year to year. This is not tosay that all changes will negatively affect the em-ployee, but at least you have the leverage to adjustwhere necessary. An approach to addressing ben-ets within the contract, yet leaving the door openfor making organizational changes where necessarycan be to simply state that the employee will be ableto take part in any benets statutorily describedunder relevant laws and to participate in all of theemployer's benet plans, which are available to itsemployees from time to time. Similarly, paid time off, company holidays, and on-call schedules should be part of your policies andguidelines and available in your company handbook,but not necessarily part of an individual employ-ment agreement. There may be an argument, how-ever, that if a benet has continued to be providedover a long period of time, the benet has become an\"implied term of the contract\" and therefore has fullcontractual status. 3 6. Conclusion Whether you currently have contractual employ-ment agreements in use in your practice, or haveconsidered utilizing them, it is important to under-stand their importance in veterinary medicine andthe key components that make them most useful.Considering your payment structure and your needfor a non-compete agreement will help you deter-mine whether or not having employment contractsin place with your associates is necessary. Finally,if you do have the need for employment contracts, besure to have them reviewed by legal counsel to makesure they are in keeping with state regulations andenforceable for the purpose that they are intended.

A detailed analysis of the non-compete, non-solicitation, and condenti-ality provisions of a veterinary employment agreement along with practical advice to help ensure thatwhat you intend to protect truly is protected. Author's AAEP. 1. Introduction Whether you are an owner of a practice or a new orexisting associate, a non-compete provision is typi-cally the pinnacle of the employment agreementwhere questions tend to arise. Naturally, both par-ties want to position themselves for the greatestopportunity for future success and as a result, thenon-compete can either be an unnecessary source ofstress for the employee, or equally as damaging,carelessly shrugged off and ignored. Here is the truth about veterinary non-com- petes, along with some helpful guidance in avoid-ing an unnecessary legal battle when a conflictdoes arise, testing the mettle of the language ofyour contract. Foremost on the mind of most em-ployers and employees is the question, \"is the non-compete enforceable?\" As most lawyers will tellyou... it depends. First it depends on the statewhere you practice. Not all states are friendly tonon-competes, and certain professions (like thelegal profession) do not allow them at all. Cali-fornia, Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Massachu-setts, and North Dakota will not uphold non-compete clauses in employment contracts. 1Be sure to check your state regulations regarding theuse of non-competes for the practice of veterinarymedicine before relying on contractual language toprotect your practice from future competition. Second, even if non-competes are allowed in your state, enforceability depends on a number offactors that make up the non-compete provision.The rst factor is the \"scope\" of the non-compete.In short, the scope is meant to address what typeof activity the non-compete prevents one from do-ing. Next is the duration in time of the non-compete and nally, the geographic restriction,meaning where it applies geographically in rela-tion to the location of the practice and its clients. Beyond an understanding of these core ele- ments, we will also explore the signicance ofcondentiality provisions as they relate to a non-compete, as well as the difference between non-compete and non-solicitation agreements. Andnally avenues will be discussed that may helpavoid an unnecessary legal battle over a non-competes enforceability. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 491THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICE NOTES2. The Framework of a Non-CompeteConsideration A primary requirement for a valid non-compete iswhether it is supported by adequate consideration.In other words, something of value must be ex-changed in order for the employee to be bound by thenon-compete. Again, state laws often weigh in onwhat is acceptable as consideration in a given juris-diction. Traditionally, this is separate consider-ation than the traditional paycheck. This isconsideration above and beyond being paid for per-forming your job. Put simply, when an employeeagrees to a restrictive covenant, he or she has to getsomething in return. Depending on your jurisdic-tion, being offered employment, or being offered con-tinued employment after employment has alreadybegun is generally not enough to support a non-compete agreement. 2 Examples of consideration could be a signing bo- nus of a reasonable amount, as well as the provisionof condential information that the employee is toreceive as part of their employment. This informa-tion could be business plans, marketing plans, clientlists, or other information that is not readily avail-able to the public. Once you have determined whether your state supports the enforcement of a non-compete and thatthere is adequate consideration, the non-compete isconstructed utilizing the three key components ofduration, geographic area, and scope of activity.Of utmost importance in determining the breadth ofthese components is making a determination thatcan be accepted as a reasonable restriction in each ofthese areas. Reasonableness When considering the duration, geographic dis-tance, and scope of activity, a measure of reason-ableness will be employed in any judicialevaluation of whether your non-compete should beupheld. What is reasonable to an employer maynot be reasonable to an independent third party,such as a jury. Given that a court of law could bethe nal measuring stick of your non-competeagreement's enforceability, it is best practice toconsider the standard of reasonableness at theoutset rather than to cut too wide a swath andoverreach the bounds of what one might consideran acceptable amount of restriction for the em-ployee it was intended. The measure of reason-ableness is not a \"one size ts all.\" Reasonablenessvaries according to practice type, location, existingcompetition, and has wide variability given thelevel of threat that a current employee would poseshould he/she openly compete against the practiceat some stage in the future. Duration Duration is the amount of time that the non-compete is determined and agreed upon to be hon-ored after the employee has left the employmentof the employer. This can range widely dependingon the type of practice, the area the practice is in,and the level of importance/dependence that thepractice places on the practitioner. Some practicesprovide a simple 18-month non-compete for new as-sociates, while a more senior member of the teammay be subject to a 3-year non-compete. An ownerin a practice may have a 5-year non-compete as partof their corporate bylaws or operating agreement. Geographic Distance The most important factor to bear in mind whendetermining the geographic reach of your non-compete is where you can reasonably defend yourprotectable interest. Many mileage radiuses getthrown around as industry norms, and while thesemight be helpful in giving you a general guideline, itis worth consideration to give some thought to yourparticular practice, the norms of your business, andwhat is routine in terms of the distance any ambu-latory employees may travel to treat horses. At thesame time, keeping in mind the population of ani-mals in your area and running a parallel track of thepercentage of those animals that are likely seen byyour practice and the percentage that could beshared with other veterinary practices. Another element of the distance factor is the placement of these area competitors in geographicrelation to your practice and to the bulk of yourclientele. As you hone in on your key practice area and the distance from your practice where you reasonablycan defend a protectable interest, it is important torealize that you are likely only going to get awaywith one dened radius of restricted activity. Inother words, your principle location will need to bedened and your radius of protectable interestshould extend only from that location. Some con-tracts will endeavor to claim that there is a radius ofprotected area extending for a given mileage dis-tance from any location where the employee per-formed work for the employer. Taken literally, foran ambulatory equine practitioner this would meanthat there is a separate radius surrounding everylocation of every horse farm, every back yard, andevery horse show where that veterinarian did work.This could, in effect, extend the initial 50-mile ra-dius up to a 300-mile radius simply by nature of theambulatory practice that routinely travels far be-yond the protected area of interest. When challenged in court, it is unlikely that such a wide protected area will be recognized as reason-able and enforced as such. This is not to say that multiple locations could not be enforced, but they would have to be signicantlocations that can be defended as a nexus of businessin a given area. For example, if you have a hospitalor clinic in the Midwest, and you routinely travel toa horse show region with a portion of your practiceand generate a substantial amount of your total 492 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICEgross revenues from that presence, then that pres-ence could be signicant enough to merit a protect-able interest. Remember, those key words need tobe used and defended in practice in order for thegeographic distance to be reasonably recognized andupheld in court. A small-animal practice in a large city may only have a non-compete geographic range of one cityblock, whereas an equine practice in a rural settingmay have a 50-mile radius or more. This can beinfluenced not only by the location of your core cus-tomers, but also by the location of your biggest com-petitors. If your largest competitor is located 60miles away and a large percentage of your customersare just beyond that range, then a larger radius maybe acceptable. Again, it is driven by what is rea-sonable to one making a determination. Be as-sured, you can agree on many things on paper, butwhat is going to be upheld in the end may not alwaysbe what was agreed upon, rather, what is most rea-sonable to a court of law. In short, just because youcan get an associate to agree to a 5-year, 100-milenon-compete does not necessarily mean it will beupheld. Scope of Activity This is the type of activity that you perform for theemployer that is a threat to that employer shouldyou stop performing that activity on behalf of theemployer and start doing it in competition with theemployer. To simply state the activity as the prac-tice of veterinary medicine is likely overreaching theboundaries of a reasonable scope. A veterinarianthat has practiced in an equine practice is not nec-essarily a threat to the business of that employershould they venture off and begin a small-animalpractice. The broadest reach of an employer is tosimply dene the scope as being the type of servicesprovided by the employee to the employer's patientsrather than trying to specically dene equine med-icine and what can be interpreted as equine veteri-nary medicine. Public Interest A nal prong on a non-compete provisions enforceabil-ity, applicable in some states, is that of public interest.To be valid and enforceable, a non-compete agreementmust not have a widespread detrimental effect on thepublic, particularly with respect to consumers. 3In other words, a practice cannot use the non-competeagreement as an attempt to secure a monopoly in agiven geographic region. In establishing enforceabil-ity, the core principle is the notion that a party shouldnot be subject to excessive and unreasonable restric-tions that were \"not designed to protect legitimatebusiness interest, but rather to prevent the employeefrom working for competitors.\" 3 Condentiality In the course of performing their duties, employeeswill have access to certain condential and proprie-tary information belonging to the employer. This isnecessary for the employee to perform their job andis considered routine business practice in most clin-ical settings. To be considered condential andproprietary the information must not be readilyavailable to the general public and must relate tothe employer's business and its clients such as busi-ness and marketing plans, patient lists, software,case histories, client contact information, x-ray lmsand personal and regular patient les, price lists,and methods of operation. This information is con-sidered valuable and unique property of the Em-ployer and would not be available to the employeeotherwise. As such, the information should be pro-tected both during the course of the employee's ten-ure with an organization and thereafter. As part oftheir employment agreement, many employees willbe asked to also sign a condentiality provisionwhereby the employee agrees that they will not uti-lize this information to interfere with the business oftheir employer. Non-Solicitation Although differing in its effect, the non-solicitationclause typically accompanies a non-compete in a vet-erinary employment agreement. Non-solicitation en-tails a promise on behalf of the employee that they will not openly solicit clients and/or otheremployees in an effort to interfere or take themaway from the current employer. In other words,a non-compete states that an employee cannotwork in a given area. Whereas a non-solicitationprovides that the employee will not openly solicitthe existing customers of an employer, or tryand hire existing employees away from the em-ployer. The two bring different approaches toprotecting the legitimate interests of the practice.Together they provide a more complete level ofprotection to the employer. Survivability A well-drafted non-compete and non-solicitationagreement will include language providing for thesurvivability of a given provision. This means thateven if a contract term should expire, the promisewithin the given provision does not. Often employ-ment agreements are not timely renewed. Withoutsurvivability language within the contract, thepromises could be interpreted as only being validwhile the contract is in effect. Including survivabil-ity language to such provisions ensures that thecovenants the contract entails will remain in forcefor as long as the employee is employed by the em-ployer and that their effect will take place immedi-ately upon termination. 3. But Now I Want to Quit... and Work for theCompetition It happens. Employees are hired, contracts aresigned, shoved in a drawer, and the real work be-gins. Years later due to any number of circum- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 493THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICEstances, the employee makes the decision to leavethe practice. It only makes sense that an employee,with years of service in a given area, with a given setof skills, and with the connections to a given clien-tele, would want to continue their career in thatrealm. Precisely the scenario that employers aretrying to prevent, thus the non-compete in the rstplace. But what if there were a compromise, a wayboth parties could get what they want? In effect,the employer is not protecting their clients from anemployee's professional service, it is the nancialimpact of that service, and the loss of business theemployer may experience as a result that is causefor concern. If the lines of communication are still open, it can be benecial to work toward an agreed settlementwherein the employee can pay a given amount to bereleased from the non-compete. In many cases, thenon-compete may not be released entirely, but itmight be tailored or trimmed to allow the formeremployee to pursue new ventures without fully vio-lating the original terms. For example, an em-ployee may wish to work in a certain county or othergeographic region, that although partially withinthe protected area, is not an open violation of theentire radius of activity. Other settlements mayallow for a shorter timeframe, say 12 months, ratherthan 18. Depending on the level of compromise the separa- tion fee may vary. If the non-compete is bought outentirely, the fee will be higher. If only a small pieceof the geographic pie is desired by the former em-ployee, the fee may be smaller. Similarly, if thetime period is completely forgiven, a higher fee vs ashortened time period that may merit a smallerbuyout fee. A number of factors will influence yourdecision in negotiating the terms of a buy-out.Of greatest importance in achieving a successfuloutcome of any separation agreement is to worktogether amicably and keep the lines of communica-tion open. When emotions began to impact the ne-gotiations or the relationship deteriorates, the stageis quickly set for failure to reach a resolution andthe potential pursuit of legal action to determine theenforceability of a non-compete. One method of addressing a potential separation is to include buyout provisions as part of the initialcontract. In this manner, the employee is wellaware of what a separation buyout would cost if theychose to remain in the area and practice the sametype of veterinary medicine. Although challenging,it is a measure of prevention that is unclouded bythe emotional impact that is often accompanied byemployment termination. 4. Addressing a Breach of Contract When a breach of contract occurs, it is important torst explore your own actions and ensure that you asthe employee or you as the employer have upheldyour end of the bargain. The best way to lose abreach-of-contract case is to be the sole party inbreach of an enforceable provision. If you are theemployer, make sure that you have complied withall provisions of the agreement rst before takingany action against a former employee who is openlycompeting in violation of the non-compete. In the absence of a settlement, when an employee does breach their non-compete the employer typi-cally sends a letter known as a cease and desist,which advises the former employee to discontinueviolating their non-compete. If this does not work,and communication lines are no longer open, a suitcan be led and the ght is now in the hands of thejudicial system. Potential Downfalls It is best to rst have your position evaluated bylegal counsel to ensure that you are standing ongood ground for a potential victory. Employersmay make the mistake of assuming that their non-compete is enforceable, only to nd that they havefailed in one or more areas to adequately protectthemselves through the language or the compliancewith the details of their contract. Areas of concern are as follows:1. Employer breaches the contract2. No legitimate interest to enforce3. Agreement is for too long a time period4. The so-called condential information is something readily available to the public 5. Public health or safety would not be served. 4 6. Alternative Resolutions Should a dispute regarding a non-compete come to adeadlock, with neither party willing to negotiatefurther, legal action may seem inevitable. Thecourt system may be a worthwhile option dependingon the circumstances of the issue. As an alterna-tive to litigation, and often as part of the litigationprocess, the conflict may nd resolution through theuse of mediation. Mediation is a form of conflict resolution wherein the parties that cannot agree are brought togetherto explain their side and lobby for their interestsbefore a neutral party. Mediation is not arbitra-tion. Mediation is, as the name implies, a mediatoror \"middle person\" who hears both sides of the ar-gument and helps to reach a resolution. Arbitra-tion, on the other hand, is a decision-making processwherein the arbitrator acts with authority in arriv-ing at a conclusion that is legally binding. A mediator's job is to help negotiate a settlement. It has been said that in a successful mediation,nobody feels like they've won. This is not to beconfused as a loss on both sides, rather, the partiesare presented with the potential fallacies in theirarguments to the point that concessions on bothsides are made so that a settlement can be reached. 7. Conclusion Any non-compete provision can be grounds for con-fusion on the front end of the employment relation- 494 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICEship and a potential legal battle at the conclusion.Should you utilize a non-compete agreement in yourpractice or be met with one as an employee, be sureand have the contract reviewed by legal counsel wellversed in the area of non-competes as they apply toyour profession. As an employer, be sure you knowyour standards of reasonableness for your practicetype and that you have the language of your contractmeticulously reviewed on an annual basis to be surethat it is in keeping with changes in your state'slegislation, and to be aware of any case law that haspaved legal ground in your jurisdiction. As an employee, have your employment agree- ment reviewed by legal counsel to ensure that youcompletely understand what you are signing. Byunderstanding and acknowledging your obligationsat the outset, you can more effectively navigate yourcareer path according to the terms of your contract.

Important gaps in coverage are a common oversight when veteri-narians obtain and renew insurance policies. This lecture will give veterinarians tips on preventingcomplaints, claims, and securing appropriate coverage. Author's You and Equine Practice Part 1Introduction This discussion will give equine practitioners tips onhow to avoid both business and malpractice claimsin their practices. In addition, information will beprovided on the appropriate types of coverageneeded for individual equine practices to assurebroad protection against liability claims (generaland professional), board complaints, and lossesunique to veterinary medicine and practice owners(damage caused by patients, damage to biologicals,and mobile practices, and more). Solution A good place to start is by dividing the types ofclaims into professional (specic to veterinarians)and business (practice owners). First we will dis-cuss professional liability. Any veterinarian with alicense is at risk of having a malpractice claim orboard complaint. Veterinary medicine remains oneof the most highly regarded professions. Yet, thereare many challenges still facing veterinary medi-cine. At some point in their practice career, manyveterinarians may face an allegation of malpracticeor a license complaint. As veterinary medicine hasadvanced, the public expectations have increased.The emerging animal law courses taught at themany law schools in our country are resulting in theveterinary profession becoming more visible andmore vulnerable to litigation. Therefore, veterinar-ians need to have appropriate insurance protection. According to cited legal suits, malpractice can be dened as the failure of a professional person to usesuch reasonable skill and diligence as are ordinarilyexpected of careful, skilled, and trustworthy personsin his or her profession. 1A veterinarian will be held to a performance level equal to that of others inhis or her eld. What other veterinarians wouldnd reasonable is termed \"Standard of Care.\" Inother words, the standard of care is determined to bewhat a reasonable veterinarian would do in a par-ticular situation. The most common situations that prompt claims involve miscommunication, adverse events and un-fortunate outcomes (without negligence), accidental 496 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICE NOTESloss or injury to animals boarding, collection proce-dures, economic loss, human injury, and negligence(mistakes and errors). This presentation will ex-amine some of these common situations and discussunique challenges specic to equine practice. Howto communicate with clients when an unfortunateoutcome occurs is a key component to decreasingcomplaints. Malpractice (or professional liability) and license complaints can be avoided by practicing good medi-cine, using enhanced communication skills, main-taining complete medical records, and keeping people out of harm's way. Actual claim exampleswill illustrate how to prevent complaints. Equine practice poses additional risks when com- pared with small animal practice because of thehigher monetary value of patients, the specialveterinarian-client-patient (V-C-P) relationship, thechallenge of recordkeeping in the eld, and the in-creased risks of human and patient injury because ofthe size and behavioral nature of these patients. Malpractice insurance responds to allegations of negligence, but not every policy is the same. Un-derstand how the rates are calculated (is it seg-mented by species or other criteria) and if your rateis affected when you le a claim. Look for featureslike a \"consent to settle clause,\" which allows theveterinarian to control whether a claim will besettled instead of the insurance carrier. Knowwhether your policy is mobile or if it only applies ata listed physical location. Also understand theclaims-handling process and how it is tailored forthe veterinary profession. Ask about the experi-ence of the attorneys provided by the insurance car-rier in defending equine practitioners.Practice Good MedicineVeterinarians and their staff are human and medi-cal errors can happen, which is why it is importantto be protected with appropriate malpractice cover-age. And even when veterinarians practice good-quality medicine and follow appropriate protocol,unfortunate outcomes can occur. Some are inher-ent risks and some may be alleged as mistakes bythe client. Participating regularly in continuing educational opportunities and practicing on the cut-ting edge of medicine is essential to practicing good,sound medicine. There are new drugs, new proce-dures, new vaccines, new protocols, and new guide-lines veterinarians continually need to be familiarwith in practice. Veterinarians should refer pa-tients if the expertise to perform a needed procedureis questionable. Veterinarians should always rec-ommend what is in the best interest of the patient.A closed claim example of malpractice due to a poormedical decision will be discussed to illustrate howto prevent claims.Enhanced Communication SkillsAccording to O'Connell and Bonvicini, 2there is a proven relationship between poor communicationand claims. The most common causes of malprac-tice claims due to miscommunication are lack ofconsent; failure to inform the client of risks, progno-sis or options; failure to inform clients of costs; fail-ure to provide complete written and verbal aftercareinstructions; and failure to listen or be available.Veterinarians should explain the risks vs benets ofa recommended procedure or drug and obtain ownerconsent. 3Using sound communication tools can help veterinarians handle upset clients, deliver badnews, and handle conflict. Communication in vet-erinary medicine is on different levels between theveterinarians, clients, and staff, which increase therisks of communication breakdowns in many places.In equine practice, communication problems arisebecause of the nature of the V-C-P relationship.Oftentimes the client relationship is with the han-dler or trainer rather than the owner, and obtainingconsent can be challenging. The veterinarian is of-ten faced with communicating the patient's medicalsituation with a third party who has care, custody,and control of the horse but does not pay the veter- inary fees. Owner complaints arise when theowner receives an unknown veterinary bill. Medi-cal history is often given by the trainer who may nothave complete knowledge of the patient's medical background. Other miscommunication examplesin equine practice that have resulted in claims aremisunderstanding of outcomes, lack of consent bythe owner, lack of followup, and language barriers.The importance and benets of good communicationwill be reviewed with actual claim examples.Disclosing Medical ErrorsAccording to Bonvicini, 4research on the relation - ship between communication and malpractice riskhas shown that the majority of the malpractice liti-gation in human medicine is related to poor commu-nication between the patient and the physician.Although many veterinarians are adept at sharingbad news with their clients in a sensitive and em-pathic manner, when the bad news is an adverseoutcome due to a medical error it requires additionaltools, insight, and practice. Because of the fear offormal complaints and potential malpractice suits,veterinarians may be hesitant to disclose an unan-ticipated outcome or error. Tips on how to disclosemedical errors to clients will be discussed.Good Medical RecordsAccording to Scoggins, 5if you are accused of mal - practice, your medical records are your best defense.Complete and legible medical records are imperativefor optimal protection when faced with a complaint.Medical records are an open component of your com-munication practices. Documentation should showsound professional judgment based on informationavailable at that time. Check with your state prac-tice act as to record requirements. A good rule tofollow is that any veterinarian who reads your re- AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 497THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICEcords should be able to pick up where you left offwith treatment of that patient. Items that should be included in medical records are written consent forms, anesthesia logs, surgeryreports, physical examination ndings, diagnosticsrecommended and declined by the client, laboratoryresults, estimate sheets, and all communication in-cluding texts, e-mails, voice messages, and verbalconversations. Pictures and videos from smartphones can provide compelling information, espe-cially for absentee clients. The quality of care willbe judged on the records. The practice owns therecords, including original radiographs. The clientof the records is entitled to copies upon requestwithin a reasonable time period. Equine practice,especially in the eld, can be additionally challeng-ing. Finding a suitable environment to write in therecord and obtaining history and consent from ab-sentee clients are a few of the challenges.Keep Clients and Patients SafeHuman-injury claims are less common but can bethe most costly and difcult to defend in court.Claimant attorneys may argue that a veterinarian isconsidered the expert in animal behavior and shouldbe aware that animals can react suddenly wheninjured or scared. Unlike small-animal practice,patient restraint by clients is more acceptable in theequine industry, which opens the veterinarian to ad-ditional exposure for human-injury claims. Once the veterinary examination has begun, it is the veterinar-ian's responsibility to assure the safety of everyone inthe immediate area. The risk of human and patientinjuries is higher in equine practice because of the sizeof the patients, the \"flight\" nature of the patients, andinexperienced, non-employee handlers restraining pa-tients. Practitioners should consider using chemicalrestraint whenever possible to reduce injuries to bothpatients and humans (employees and clients). Prac-ticing sound medicine by making intelligent, safe re-straint decisions prior to treatment will help reducehuman and patient injuries.Professional Extension (Animal Bailee)Animal bailee covers damage to animals in yourcare, custody, and control resulting from an outsidesource and not related to a veterinary incident.Typically, this includes losses resulting from re,theft, escape, flood, catastrophic weather, injuries installs, paddocks, pastures, in addition to many otherperils not related to treatment. This is an impor-tant coverage for practice owners if their practicehospitalizes, boards and/or transports animals.A practice owner could be held accountable for inju-ries to or death of patients while in their care.Practice owners should check their policies for cov-erage of patient injuries not related to a veterinaryincident. This is especially valuable to practiceowners. Practitioners that are completely mobileand do not keep or transport patients in their care,custody, or control do not need this coverage.An important exclusion often found in profes- sional liability policies is that any loss of semen andembryos while in storage or transit is not covered.Veterinarians can ask their insurance providerabout securing an endorsement to cover losses whilein storage or transit by the insured veterinarian (notthird party transit/UPS/FedEx). Discussion In summary, equine practice poses additional risks ofclaims when compared with small-animal practice.The higher monetary value of patients prompts clients to seek economic losses by ling a malpractice claimwhen faced with an adverse event. The special vet-erinarian- client-patient relationship, the challeng- ing record keeping environment in the eld, and theincreased risks of human and patient injury all addto the potential exposures of equine practice. Knowthe perceived monetary value of your equine patientsand secure policy limits in line with their value. 2. Protecting You and Your Equine Practice Part 2SolutionBusiness Liability (Practice Liability) Practice owners have additional liability exposuresas well as malpractice. These risks include work-ers' compensation and employment practice liabilityclaims if they have employees, property damageclaims, general liability claims for nonemployee hu-man injuries, and business interruption claims dueto loss of income from property damage. There areseveral important endorsements often excludedfrom standard policies that are specic to the practiceof veterinary medicine. Practice owners need to beaware of these endorsements or exclusions to assurethey have appropriate coverage for their business.Business Owner's Policy (Practice Owner'sPackage)The scope of the veterinary industry is vast andgrowing in complexity every year. With a wide va-riety of business structures (from the solo mobilepractitioner to the multi-location practice to referralcenters), it necessitates a highly specialized insur-ance program. The most important factor whenchoosing an insurance program is choosing a pro-gram that ts the specic and individual businessneeds of that entity. This discussion will touch on a variety of business insurance (property and casualty) claims that areunique to the veterinary industry and will demon-strate the subsequent effect on the business. Thereare three areas of focus: workers' compensation,employment practices liability, and property dam-age. Actual claim examples will be used to illus-trate the real-dollar impact to a veterinary practice.Workers' CompensationWorkers' compensation (WC) is a form of insuranceproviding benets, 498 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 PROCEEDINGSTHE TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICEbilitation, disability benets, and survivor benetsto employees injured in the course of employment inexchange for a mandatory relinquishment of theemployee's right to sue his or her employer for thedamage caused by possible negligence. 6Most em - ployers choose a workers' compensation plan basedon pricing, but not all plans are created equal.Practice owners should review the coverage limitsand consider whether their practice has unique ex-posures such as volunteers or international travel.The practice owner should be knowledgeable aboutthe provider's procedures to prevent fraudulentclaims. Insurance carriers should also provide re-sources and strategies to help the employee returnto work as soon as possible after an injury andreduce disability costs. According to The Hartford , return-to-work programs treat work as therapy tohelp the employee recover up to three times faster,restoring productivity of both the employee and yourbusiness. 7Key features a WC provider should offer are employers' liability limits of at least $500,000with an option for higher limits, coverage for volun- teers working at your practice, and risk-managementtools. Ask about training tools for the entire teamto utilize to reduce WC claims through strong safetyprotocols and education. Also look for a providerthat does not automatically subrogate against yourclients when a patient injures an employee. WC premiums will be the most expensive insurance premium for a business owner. A high-experienceMOD (modication factor, based on the frequency andseverity of the claims reported at an individual prac-tice) will negatively affect a practice owner's premium.Good risk-management policies in place for employeeswill help prevent high MOD experience.Employment Practices LiabilityEmployment Practices Liability (EPL) is an areathat deals with wrongful termination, sexual ha-rassment, discrimination, invasion of privacy,breach of contract, emotional distress, and wage andhour law violations. An EPL policy responds tothese allegations and provides legal counsel forthe policyholder. EPL claims can be reported tothe Equal Employment Opportunities Commis-sion (EEOC) by employees at no charge to them.An EPL claim can be very stressful and the duty todefend these allegations could put a practice with-out EPL insurance in nancial jeopardy. Pregnancy discrimination claims are the most common EPL claims led by veterinarians. Veter-inary practices are at greater risk of pregnancy dis-crimination claims because of the higher percentageof female employees working in the veterinary pro-fession. It is important for practices to have poli-cies and procedures for pregnant workers so boththe employer and the employee have clear goals toaccomplish a workable solution. The employeeshould consult with her physician to determine whattasks can be performed and what tasks should beavoided, and the employer should be updated as thepregnancy advances. 8Actual claims will be dis - cussed to highlight how to prevent an EPL claim.9 Property InsuranceA typical business owner's policy covers three majorcomponents: the building, the contents inside(medical equipment, computers, furniture, pharma-ceuticals, etc.), and general (casualty) liability.For veterinary practices, the exposures can be dif-ferent than other small businesses. As a practiceowner, consider the liability of clients loading andunloading horses on your property, a loss of powercompromising your perishable pharmaceuticals orshort-circuiting your x-ray unit. A re could dam-age the contents of your building, including expen-sive medical equipment and patient les. If a staffmember runs an errand on behalf of the practice andis involved in a car accident, the practice owner andthe practice could be liable. If a horse kicks anultrasound machine and damages it beyond repair,does the business insurance policy cover this type of loss? Practice owners should check the business owner's policy for key features that will protect thebusiness from these real-life scenarios. Importantendorsements to look for are: mobile equipmentcoverage (in transit and replacement value of equip-ment, not actual cash value), business interruptioncoverage, equipment damage from patients, mobileloss of income, and extra expense endorsement (pro-tects mobile equipment and the business income ifthe practice vehicle is out of service due to a coveredloss), temperature change (spoilage) losses of perish-ables, hired/non owned auto (protects the business ifan employee driver is involved in an accident duringa work related errand), and adequate limits to coverpotential losses. These features may not befound in a standard business policy. Veterinaryclaim examples will be discussed such as spoilage ofbiologicals, animal damage to equipment, business in-terruption, and accidents related to hired/non-ownedautomobile coverage that will illustrate how to bestprotect against these claims. 10 Discussion Brokers and carriers should provide risk-managementtools and training for their clients. These are pro-vided as a way for insureds to educate themselves on current trends, safety procedures, and loss pre-vention. Most insurance programs provide clientaccess to specied websites to help practitionerscreate a tailored risk management program. Re-sources found on these websites include employeetraining modules, articles on current safety trends,pre-loss prevention support, hazard identicationtips, safety policies and procedures, and webinars.Physical resources are also available such as books,posters, or pamphlets to suit practice owners' spe-cic needs. Using risk-management tools will helpreduce claim frequency and severity. This trans-lates to a safer work environment and overall lowerpolicy premiums.

Business insurance BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICECurrent Horse Owner Petition for TelemedicalAssessment of Equine Lameness G. Robert Grisel, DVM The familiarity and extensive use associated with smart devices among today's equestrians hasgenerated a demand for telecommunication services relating to the veterinary evaluation of lamehorses. Appropriately, the modern equine sports practitioner needs to establish a professional,ethical, and effective way of administering to this demand. Author's address: The Atlanta AAEP. 1. a search for the key words \"lame horse\"on a popular video Web site acurrently yields ap- proximately 140,000 results. A minority of thefootage comprises instructional videos intended todemonstrate general signs of lameness or highlightspecic gait decits. These are posted by profes-sionals and non-professionals alike and are intendedfor anyone who might be curious. The vast major-ity of clips, however, are posted by horse owners whoare summoning advice with regard to a possiblereason for their horse's current performance is-sue(s). These posts are directed at anyone who iswilling to provide feedback, irrespective of trainingor experience with equine lameness. Veterinary medicine (not unlike other forms of medicine) has historically lagged behind the tech-nology curve, particularly with regard to client com-munication. This is due to a number of factors notexcluding ongoing professional and ethical concerns.Notwithstanding, a signicant number of horseowners are seeking professional guidance in a dif-ferent form than that currently available; one thatdoes not require the time and expense associatedwith a typical veterinary visit and hands-on perfor-mance evaluation. The purpose of this prospective investigation was to identify the demographic proles and currentlevel of interest with respect to veterinary telemedi-cal video correspondence within the performancehorse industry. 2. Materials and Methods An online survey request was sent to approximately3200 horse owners and trainers via email. Thestudy population was procured from the practicedatabase and comprised regular clients, former cli-ents, and non-client horse owners, the majority ofwhom resided in the southeastern United States.Survey forms were provided and submitted throughan online survey service b. Questions were in- tended to establish the following with regard to eachparticipant (Fig. 1): Basic demographic prole with respect to equine lameness Current extent of video acquisition of lame horses AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 501THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICE NOTESFig. 1.

Mean val-ues and standard deviation were calculated whenpossible. 3. ResultsParticipant Demographics A total of 83 responses were received. Of the eques-trians participating in the survey, just over half (48individuals, 57.8%) owned only one or two horses(Fig. 2A; mean /H113494.0; SD, /H110114.6) and seventy (nearly 85%) spent less than $5000 per year treating and/ormanaging lameness issues (Fig. 2C; mean /H113492775.0; SD,/H110113173.3). Participant Use of Video Three quarters (63 or 75.9%) of the participants hadpreviously acquired video footage of their horse(s)for lameness review (Fig. 3A). Of these, 59 (94%)acquired the footage with the intention of seekingveterinary counsel (Fig. 3B). Participant Use of the Internet One third (21 of the 63 equestrians) acquiring foot-age of their lame horses uploaded it to the Internet(Fig. 4A). Just over three quarters (76.2%) of theseutilized Web-based services cthrough which to submit footage for professional review. Fourteen percent ofthe participants were seeking non-professional advice(Fig. 4B). Participant Request for Professional Counsel By the time this survey was closed in 2017, morethan 70% (71.1%) of all participants had alreadysummoned professional evaluation via telemedicalmeans. The majority of footage was sent via email(utilized by 64.4% of participants) and text messag-ing (utilized by 49.2% of participants). The smart-phone, employed by three quarters (74.6%) of theparticipants, was the submission device of choice(Fig. 5C). Only one third (37.3%) of the contribu-tors utilized their desktop or laptop computer(s). Fig. 2. Participant demographic proles. Fig. 3. Number of participants acquiring video footage. AAEP PROCEEDINGS /H11408Vol. 63 /H114082017 503THE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICEExcessive distance, considered by more than half (57.6%) of the participants, was a major catalyst inthe decision to summon telemedical evaluation asopposed to scheduling an on-site appointment withthe veterinarian (Fig. 5D). Almost one third (30.5%)of the horse owners procuring telemedical consultationwere charged for the service. Overall, 86.4% of thosecontributing to this survey were satised with thereview that they received. Participant Petition for Telemedical Evaluation ofLameness More than three quarters (78.3%) of equestrianscontributing to this survey reported that they wouldprefer veterinarians to offer telemedical review ofvideo footage as a service, citing a variety of reasons(Fig. 6). An additional 20.5% indicated that theywould use such a service if it proved to be costeffective. Only two of the horse owners that com-pleted the questionnaire (accounting for 2.4% of thewhole) reported that they would be unwilling to payfor veterinary medical consultation via telemedicalmeans. 4. Discussion The results of this survey support a demand fortelemedical evaluation of video footage by equineveterinarians. Equestrians will likely continue tosummon remote professional review, presumablyat an increasing rate. Accordingly, many equinesports practitioners will be compelled to devise along-term solution that will favor both the reputa-bility and protability of their practice. Severalstrategies relating to this form of evaluation havealready been described 1,2although further quali - cation is needed. Telemedical assessment services undoubtedly benet the average horse owner by saving the timeand money typically associated with regular on-sitesoundness evaluation(s). Given that most horse Fig. 4.

Number of participants soliciting professional review.504 2017 /H11408Vol. 63 /H11408AAEP PROCEEDINGSTHE BUSINESS OF PRACTICE: TOOLS TO PROTECT YOUR PRACTICEowners trainers are not procient at visuallyassessing equine lameness, 3timely advice from a veterinarian also accelerates the recognition of aproblem, thereby hastening its diagnosis and treat-ment. This, in turn, improves the animal's progno-sis for future performance. Providing video review options also favors the vet- erinary professional by increasing the regularityand efciency with which he/she can evaluate lamehorses and communicate with clients. This in turnenhances the practitioner's overall accessibility andvalue from the client's perspective. Notwithstand-ing, this form of remote medical practice raises anumber of issues that are worth considering: Service validity . To afx credibility and value to this service, veterinarians have to maintainample prociency with respect to their abilityto visually assess movement of the lame horse. Service protability . Almost 98% of equestri- ans that completed the survey would be willingto pay for telemedical review of video foot-age. Standardizing fee schedules for tele-medical services is advantageous to the equineveterinary community. Ethical considerations . Many horse owners choose to solicit telemedical lameness assess-ment with the intention of replacing the moreexpensive and time-consuming on-site exami-nation. In the author's opinion, it is impor-tant that the professional community regardtelemedical review as a means of replacing alack of (any) assessment as opposed to replac- ing direct hands-on evaluation, with the soleintention of inciting and/or supplementing thelatter. Providing a diagnosis pursuant tovideo review alone is considered to be inappro-priate and unethical practice. Professional conduct . Undoubtedly, veteri-narians are already receiving video clips fromhorse owners outside of their practice'sclientele pool and/or geographical boundar-ies. This poses concern with respect to unfairor non-licensed competition between veteri-nary practices. It should be emphasized thatthe primary goal of telemedical review is toprecipitate an on-site meeting between the cli-ent and primary veterinarian at the appropri-ate time and under the proper circumstances. Future installation of the modality. Nowa- days there are many ethical considerationsaffecting the practice of equine sports medi-cine. The appropriate use of telemedicine isquickly becoming one of them. Although thispractice is relatively common and currentlyaccepted in the elds of human and veterinaryradiology, it has not yet established itself as an ofcial method of visual lameness assess- ment. Nevertheless, the advent of smart de-vices make solicitation of telemedical lamenessevaluation a natural alternative for the mod-ern horse owner. Further investigation intothe development of a professional, ethical, andeffective way of administering to this demandis warranted.
