Executive Summary In June 2007, the Oregon Legislature passe d the Healthy Oregon Act (Senate Bill 329, Chapter 697 Oregon Laws 2007). The Act called for the appointment of the seven-member Oregon Health Fund Board to develop a comprehensive plan to ensure access to health care for all Oreg onians, contain health care costs, and address issues of quality in health care. The Healthy Oregon Act also established a set of committees to deve lop recommendations regarding what the reform plan will look like. While several elements of the Act contained references to equity and fairness, no sp ecific mechanism for developing equity strategies was included in the legislation. The newly established Oregon Health Fund Board, in an effort to create that mechanism, created the Health Equities Committee. The Health Equities Committee became the sixth committee of the Oregon Health Fund Board and was ch artered with developing multiple strategies to reduce health disparities in Oregon and to ensure that any health reform would specifically include elements to ensure that all Oregonians benefit equally from an improved and expanded health care system. The Health Equities Charter (See Appe ndix A - Health Equities Committee Charter) directed the Committee to develop multicultural strategies for program outreach, eligibility, and enrollment procedures as well as to make policy recommendations for reducing health disp arities through delivery system reform and the benefit design of the Oregon Health Fund program. The Committee developed a series of re commendations aligned with the Board's priority areas, which the members believe w ill result in increased access to health care; an improved delivery system for Oregon's vulnerable populations; an affordable benefit package that meets the needs of Oregon's diverse communities; and healthier individuals, families, and communities. Preventing Health Disparities before th ey Occur: Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention and Management Eliminating health disparities in chronic disease will have a profound economic impact on the state's health care system and will increase earnings over a lifetime as well as lower poverty rates, particularly for ethnic minorities. 1 The Committee recommends addressing the sustainability of the health care system by 1 E.D. Crook and M. Peters, Health Disparities in Chronic Diseases: Where the Money Is, (The American Journal of Medical Sciences, 335(4):266-270, April 2008). HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 8recognizing that the health of the individual begins at home and within the context of families, cultures, and communities (both locational and relational). Many chronic diseases have had a disproportional impact on communities of color.2 Eliminating these disparities requir es culturally-specific approaches to promoting health and preventing chronic disease. Recommendation 1: Promote population-based approaches The Health Equities Committee recommends an on-going, substantial investment in public health activities that will prevent disease and promote the health of Oregonians. Culturally-speci fic approaches to disease prevention and health promotion must be part of this investment. Recommendation 2: Strengthen the relationship between health-focused Community-Based Organizations and the health care delivery system. The Health Equities Committee recommends designing a contracting mechanism that will empower primar y care clinics who primarily serve vulnerable populations to build fina ncial agreements with health-focused community-based organizations that provide culturally-specific health promotion and disease management services. Recognizing that not every organization providing an integrated health home is focused on serving vulnerable populations, an alternative to renewable contracts should exist that will enable a provider to purchase community-based and/or culturally-specific services. The Health Equities Committee recommends that high-value community- based health promotion, disease prevention, and chronic disease management services be eligible for direct reimbursement. Accountable Health Plans must reimburse a broader range of health pr ofessionals including, but not limited to, Community Health Workers, and a br oader range of services including, but not limited to, peer-led disease manage ment support groups in culturally- specific programs to maximize the health and function of individuals, families, and communities. Recommendation 3: Develop programs to incentivize healthy personal decision- making 2 A. C. Beal, M. M. Doty, S. E. Hernandez, K. K. Shea, and K. Davis, Closing the Divide: How Medical Homes Promote Equity in Health Care: Results From The Commonwealth Fund 2006 Health Care Quality Survey (New York: The Commonwealth Fund, June 2007). HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 9The Health Equities Committee recommends that the state create a Wellness Account for individuals participating in the Oregon Health Fund program who receive a subsidy. The state would deposit money in the We llness Account based on completion of wellness activities. Monies accrued in the account could be used towards program cost-sharing expenses such as premiums and co-pays, or towards non- covered wellness activities, such as gym memberships or yoga classes. Financial incentives would encourage individuals to engage in activities that promote health, such as participating in a smoking-cessation program, getting recommended tests and procedures, and chronic disease management activities. The Wellness Account is modeled after E nhanced Benefit Accounts (EBAs) that are currently being implemented in several state Medicaid programs. Reducing Barriers to Health Care Low-income individuals, who are dispropo rtionately from communities of color, are more likely to be uninsured and to experience other barriers to accessing health care. 3 Reducing these barriers also impacts many other aspects of people's lives. In California, parents of children newly enrolled in the State Children's Health Insurance Program re ported that their children performed better in school, felt better physically, and were able to get along better with thepeers than they did befo re they had insuran ir ce. 4 Recommendation 1: Implement universal eligibility It is a long-held Oregon value that all Oregon residents have equal opportunity to support their families, pay taxes, and contribute to the State's economy. To maintain the health of that workforce, it is fair, wise, and in the State's economic interest that the Oregon Health Fund program shall be available to all Oregon residents. Recognizing the political and fiscal imp lications of this recommendation, the Health Equities Committee believes th e Oregon Health Fund Board should establish an 'Oregon Primary Care Benefit Plan', or alternatively a health care pool, within the Oregon Health Fund Program for non-qualified Oregon 3 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , National Healthcare Disparities Report . 2003-2006; Institute of Medicine, Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care (Washington, D.C.: National Academy of Sciences, 2003). 4 M. Seid, J.W. Varni, L. Cummings and M. Schonlau, The Impact of Realized Access to Care in Health- Related Quality of Life in the California State Children's Health Insurance Program, (Journal of Pediatrics, 149:354-61, September, 2006). HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT residents [legal immigrants who have been in the U.S. under 5 years, and individuals without documentation] who cannot afford to purchase health care without a subsidy. Financing for this port ion of the program could be structured so that industries employing non-qualif ied Oregon residents are directed to contribute through the 'play or pay' requirement of the employer mandate based on the percentage of employees who would qualify for the Oregon Primary Care Benefit Plan. Recommendation 2: Address citizenship documentation barrier As consistent with current practices in the private marketplace, the Health Equities Committee recommends that citiz enship documentation should not be a requirement to participate in the Oregon Health Fund program. The Health Equities Committee further recommends investigating the possibility of obtaining a federal waiver to exempt Oregon from the citizenship documentation requirements imposed by the CMS through administrative rule, based on the Deficit Reduction Act of 2006. Recommendation 3: Conduct targeted an d aggressive outreach to multicultural communities A media-only approach to outreach for the Oregon Health Fund program is not an adequate response to reducing disp arities in health insurance status in Oregon. The Health Equities Committee recommends a sustainable funding mechanism, with additional Medicaid ma tching funds, to support community- based organizations in delivering culturally-specific and targeted outreach and direct application assistance to members of racial, ethnic, and language minority communities; individuals living in geographic isolation; and populations that encounter additional barriers such as individuals with cognitive, mental health or sensory diso rders, physical disabilities, chemical dependency, and individuals experiencing homelessness. 100% enrollment of individuals who are e ligible to participate in the Oregon Health Fund program is the object, an d resources and interventions must be targeted towards this goal. Recommendation 4: Implement a ffordable cost-sharing policies The Health Equities Committee recommends equitable and fair sharing of health care costs. 10HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 11Health insurance coverage with high deductibles and out-of-pocket costs disproportionately hurts low-income indi viduals' ability to obtain needed care, further contributing to health disparities. Equitable cost-sharing policies take into account and attempt to minimize the uneven impact that cost-sharing arrangements may have on health care access. Specific recommendations on how to promote equitable and fair sharing of health care costs are detailed on pages 26-27 of this report. Improving the Quality of Care There are several strategies that have b een demonstrated to be effective at reducing the disparities of care that occur within the context of health care delivery.5 Recommendation 1: Promote integrated health homes Elements of the integrated health home (also referred to as the \"medical home\") model that have been demonstrated to reduce health disparities must be encouraged in any medical service organization purporting delivery of an integrated health home. Examples of these successful approaches are on page 28 of this report. For some populations, an integrated health home may be best provided outside of the traditional primary care service delivery system and a definition of integrated health home should not exclude organizations based on service-delivery type but should include coordination of care by a licensed medical provider. The integrated health home needs to be viewed in the context of the social and education system, hospital and specialty care system, and public health system in a community. Recommendation 2: Benefit package de sign should support the health of vulnerable populations by ensuring their health care needs are met and that care is affordable Remove any financial barriers and in crease reimbursement for preventive services, chronic disease management, patient education programs, and after- hours/walk-in primary care. 5 A. C. Beal, M. M. Doty, S. E. Hernandez, K. K. Shea, and K. Davis , Closing the Divide: How Medical Homes Promote Equity in Health Care: Results From The Commonwealth Fund 2006 Health Care Quality Survey (New York: The Commonwealth Fund, June 2007). HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT The benefit program designed should improve access to and utilization of appropriate services in an integrated health home and support community-based organizations to assist in health promotion. The benefit program should also reward patients who actively participate in their own care, through incentives for patients who follow through with the medi cal treatment plan agreed upon with their health care providers. Encouragin g patients to receive treatment for early disease in the less expensive outpatient se tting, rather than waiting until disease progression requires extensive inpatient care will benefit both individuals and society. The state should also encourage providers to expand availability to patients (e.g. operating during evening and weekend hours). Patient education programs can help reduce health care disparities by providing patients with skills to effectively navigate health care systems and ensure that their needs and preferences are met. For example, patient education programs have been found to be effective in reducing racial and et hnic disparities in pain control. Support direct reimbursement for Community Health Workers (CHWs) for publicly-sponsored health programs. Community Health Workers (CHWs), also known as promotores/as, Community Health Representatives (CHRs) , lay health advisors, and outreach workers, among other names, are trained members of medically underserved communities who work to improve he alth outcomes. CHW programs have proven effective in teaching disease prevention, reducing barriers to care, improving patient-provider communicati on, and improving community health. Oregon can stimulate these programs by pr oviding a variety of funding sources, including direct reimbursement. Estab lishing direct reimbursement may involve developing a certification system for CHWs . Any certification system should be designed and governed by CHWs and CHW advocates . Analyze the cost-effectiveness and health equity benefits of alternative and complementary medicine including, but not limited to, traditional Chinese medicine for the inclusion of such health services in the benefit design of publicly-sponsored health programs Ensure that Oregonians have access to affordable evidence-based alternative and complementary medicine. Alternative and complementary medicine can reduce health disparities by providing culturally-specific approaches to improving health. These types of health services should also be vetted by the same standards as allopathic medicine and promoted in the commercial market of health care as allopathic medicine. 12HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT Recommendation 3: Ensure language access Take advantage of growing technological capacity in Oregon by creating a state-wide pool of qualified, certified interpreters and organizations that may be able to utilize and build on technologies being developed for telemedicine or telehealth. Seek federal matching funds for interp reter services through Medicaid. This helps ensure affordable interpreter se rvices for providers who see Medicaid patients. Use state regulation to impose mandates with funds to offset subsequent costs. Recommendation 4: Address workforce issues The Health Equities Committee focused their workforce recommendations on two domains. The first domain the committ ee felt should be addressed in health reform policy would aim to ensure an adequate workforce that reflects the diversity of Oregonians. Expand educational institution capacity at health professional schools where more training opportunities are need ed across the board from community college to university and postgraduate levels. Increase financial aid in health profe ssional schools for students needing more financial aid of the right kind (grants, scholarships, loan forgiveness). Strengthen the pipeline to health profession schools; intervention needs to start early and focus on retention. Support mentoring program models that have been demonstrated to be effective in retaining students. This includes convening all entities th at are currently working on pipeline development issues so that efforts are coordinated, streamlined, and strategic in planning for the future needs of Oregon's population. Improve the climate for diversity at i ndividual health professional schools by mandating cultural (including sexual and gender minorities, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable po pulations) and linguistic competence throughout the institution. Utilize existing agencies to establish and report on diversity goals for health & hospital systems and health care traini ng institutions to the Oregon Health Fund Board on a biennial basis . 13HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT Support Community Health Worker progr ams that recruit and train members of underserved communities to provide culturally and linguistically competent health services with in that community. The second domain of healthcare work force the committee felt was crucial to eliminating health disparities is to ensure providers are trained to be culturally- sensitive healthcare practitioners. Mandate a minimum level of educational cr edits for health care providers that must be earned in coursework specifically designed to increase cultural competence and/or awareness. Recommendation 5: Expand data collection efforts In Oregon there is such a dearth of data related to race, ethnicity, and primary language in health care that it is difficult to identify, let alone address, disparities in health care access, health care utilization, disease status, and/or quality of care. Where data exists, sources of are difficult to combine or compare due to differences in definitions and data collection protocols. Recommendation: All health care providers and health plans participating in the Oregon Health Fund Program must be required to collect and report data on race, ethnicity, age-appropriate sexual orientation, gender, disability status, and primary language. These measures need to be included when assessing quality and ensuring transparency. Recommendation 6: Implement in itiatives to enhance quality In its role as convener and collabora tor, the Quality Institute should be responsible for: o Training provider organizations a nd health plans on protocols for collecting race, ethnicity, and primary language data based on the highest national standards. This will ensure consistency and comparability among data sources, increase cultural competency, and reduce provider discomfort with collecting this kind of information from patients. o Developing a Health Disparities strategy that utilizes data to identify disparities and assist communities with evaluating interventions to reduce disparities. o Aligning resources to support quality healthcare across all demographic populations in Oregon. 14HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 15o Disseminating meaningful and accurate information on health quality and utilization of healthcare resources in a manner that is accessible and understandable to individuals from a variety of cultural, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. Concluding Thoughts of th e Health Equities Committee The social determinants of health must be acknowledged in any explicit effort to reduce health disparities. Social determ inants of health acknowledge that an individual's health is not solely understood by determining insurance status, by isolating the experience between patient and provider, nor can it be adequately addressed by focusing on individuals and individual responsibility. Health is more than health care. A review of popu lation health factors determined that non-medical factors (genetic predispositions, social circumstances, environmental conditions, and behavioral patterns) are responsible for a large proportion of preventable mortality in the United States, perhaps 85-90 percent. 6,7 In the acclaimed PBS documentary series, Unnatural Causes: Is Inequality Making Us Sick ?, Dr. David Williams aptly frames the scope necessary to truly address health inequities through social policy when he argues: \"Housing policy is health policy, educational policy is health policy, anti-violence policy is health policy, neighborhood improvement policies are health policies. Everything that we can do to improve the quality of life of indi viduals in our society has an impact on their health and is a health policy\". Other states have acknowledged this by passing legislation giving members of the legislative body, or other policy- makers, an opportunity to request an assessment of how any proposed policy might impact the health of vulnerable populations. Health impact-assessment tools provide policy-makers with information to evaluate how education policy, housing policy, economic policy, land-us e policy (as examples) might benefit or harm the health of individuals, families, or communities. 8 The Health Equities Committee strongly encourages the Oregon Health Fund Board and other policy-makers to consider creating avenues for racial, ethnic, and cultural minorities to participate in an on-going effort to address health disparities in Oregon. These commun ities are the first to identify and understand the problems that affect them and will have the best ideas about how to address these problems effectively. Health care is experienced locally and 6 Schroeder S, We Can Do Better\u2014Improving the Health of the American People, (The New England Journal of Medicine, 357(12):1221-1228, September 20, 2007;). 7 McGinnis JM, Williams-Russo P, and Knickman JR, The case for more active policy attention to health promotion, (Health Affairs, 21(2):78-93, March/April 2002). 8 B.

HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 16solutions for health care dilemmas must be addressed by engaging, supporting, and allowing the impacted communities to lead the way. Finally, efforts to reduce health dispari ties can begin immediately, outside of health care reform, or as part of any staged implementation that involves expanding Medicaid. Appendix C descr ibes Health Equities Committee recommendations that align with strategies that have been successfully implemented in other state Medicaid prog rams, or hold potential for improving Oregon's existing Medicaid program. II. Conceptual Framework and Committee Process Conceptual Framework The Health Equities Committee used five broad concepts to inform and shape their approach to developing strategies that would reduce he alth disparities in Oregon (see Figure 1 on the following page ). The first concept is often referred to as the social determinants of health, the second is providing access to the health care delivery system, the third is the co ncept of providing culturally competent health care, the fourth relates to the ro le of communities in shaping their own health and identifying solutions to prob lems within the community, and the fifth is monitoring the quality of care. The Committee also felt it was essentia l to have a shared understanding between members of the term 'cultural competence ' in order to work together towards policy recommendations that would seek this objective in health care. A search of Oregon statute revealed a definition that the Committee felt would meet this objective: Cultural competence refers to the process by which individuals and systems respond respectfully and effectively to people of all cultures, languages, classes, races, ethnic ba ckgrounds, disabilities, religions, genders, sexual orientation and other diversity factors in a manner that recognizes, affirms, and values the worth of individuals, families and communities and protects and preserves the dignity of each (OAR 415- 056-0005).

The diversity of Oregon was represented by the sixteen members of the Health Equities Committee. The Committee held a total of ten meet ings, during which members developed a number of strategic policy recommendatio ns that would move Oregon towards an equitable health care system. The Co mmittee invited a number of guests to present on specific topic areas including: o Current outreach efforts for the Oregon Health Plan by the Department of Medical Assistance Programs (DMAP) and the impact of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2007 (DRA) citizens hip documentation requirements on enrollment: Jeanny Phillips and Karen House. o Primary Care Renewal and Medical Homes: Craig Hostetler, Oregon Primary Care Association, and Dr. David Labby, CareOregon. o Oregon Workforce Issues, Dr. Lisa Dodson, Oregon Health & Science University's Department of Family Medicine o Language Access: Mara Youdelman, National Health Law Program o Community Health Workers: Teresa Rios Campos, Capacitation Coordinator, Community Capacitation Center, Multnomah County Health Department o Public Health: Dr. Grant Higginson, Katherine Bradley, and Joel Young Public Health Division, Oregon Department of Human Services o Care Coordination: Dr. Mark Reddi ng, Executive Director, Children's Community Health Access Project (CHAP) and Laura Brennan, PacificSource Foundation o Safety Net: Members of the Safety Net Advisory Council The Committee also benefited from public input during portions of each meeting from a variety of stakeholders and the public, including: Oregon Primary Care Association, National College of Natural Medicine, Palliative Care Physician's Roundtable, Archimedes Movement (Portland Chapter), Women with Disabilities Health Equity Coalition (WowDHEC), Oregon Healthcare Workforce Institute, and a Rosewood Family Heal th Center Medicaid Enrollment staff member. Materials, presentations and recordings fr om the meetings are available from the Oregon Health Fund website at: http://www.oregon.gov/OHPPR/HFB/ Health_Equities_Committee.shtml 18HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 19III. Preventing Disparities before They Occur With the aging of the state population and the rising prevalence of chronic disease, health disparities have important implications for the state's health care system in the near future. The Committ ee recommends addressing sustainability of the health care system by recognizing that the health of th e individual begins at home and within the context of families, cultures, and communities (both locational and relational). Many chronic diseases have had disproportional impacts on communities of color.9 Eliminating these disparities require culturally-specific approaches to promoting health and preventing chronic disease. Policy Recommendations on Preventing He alth Disparities through Targeted and Culturally-Specific Programs of Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention/ Management. As identified by the Delivery System Committee of the Oregon Health Fund Board, there are few incentives in the cu rrent health care system to prevent disease and truly promote a healthy population. Even fully-capitated managed care organizations do not always see dire ct benefit from investing in prevention efforts that pay off in the long run because of movement in and out, and between, health care plans. The Oregon Health Fund program has the opportunity to save money with long-term prevention investments that improve the overall health of Oregonians as they move in and out of plans while remaining in the overall Health Fund Program. i . Population-Based Approaches Recommendation: The Health Equities Committee recommends an on-going, substantial investment in public health activities that will prevent disease, and promote the health of Oregonians. We believe that part of this investment should be directed towards using cultu rally-specific approaches to disease prevention and health promotion. a. Initiatives that target health disparit ies should be guided by members from the communities experiencing health disparities. i. The Quality Institute and the Pu blic Health Department would provide data to support decision -making on establishing funding and program priorities. ii. Priorities will likely vary by region. 9 A. C. Beal, M. M. Doty, S. E. Hernandez, K. K. Shea, and K. Davis, Closing the Divide: How Medical Homes Promote Equity in Health Care: Results From The Commonwealth Fund 2006 Health Care Quality Survey (New York: The Commonwealth Fund, June 2007). HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT iii. Multiple granting approaches should be used: 1. Planning grants should be made available for regional collaboratives to develop aro und a proposed intervention. 2. Competing grants should be designed to encourage creativity and collaboration. 3. Non-competitive continuation grants should be available to maintain funding support for programs that have demonstrated success at meeting the goals of the grant. 4. Emerging Issue grants should be available for communities to develop strategies and interventions around newly identified problems impact ing population health. b. Regional collaboratives consisting of social service organizations, culturally-specific organizations, health care organizations, and other community partners and community-ba sed organizations would apply for grants that address targeted dispar ities with community-driven and implemented approaches. i. Matching regional funds may be required. ii. Funding should be administered in a way that supports the necessary steps to achieving targ eted outcomes, and the outcomes themselves. Data & evaluation su pport will be provided through partnership with Public Health. iii. Effective programs will be shared and problem-solving will be facilitated through convening regional collaborative leadership (in person or virtually) on a quarterly basis in learning collaboratives. Health focused, community-based organi zations have been very successful in providing culturally-specific programs th at promote health, prevent disease, and help manage chronic diseases. Th ese programs are overly reliant on federal grant priorities and struggle with sustainability. Providing a truly integrated health care home for mu lticultural communities requires a stronger relationship between these or ganizations and primary care clinics that serve vulnerable populations. ii. Strengthen the relationship between providers and culturally-specific Community-Based Organizations (CBO's) Recommendation: The Health Equities Committee recommends designing a contracting mechanism that will empower primary care clinics who primarily serve vulnerable populations to build financial agreements with health-focused community-based organizations that provide culturally-specific health promotion and disease management services. 20HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT Renewable contracts will be awarded to health care clinics that partner with culturally-specific social service organizations (including organizations that focus on Persons with Disabilities, GLBT populati ons, homeless youth or adults, and populations with low literacy and illiteracy) to provide an integrated health care home. Clinics that have established in -house capacity for culturally-specific approaches would not be required to contract out for services already being rendered. a. Partnership must include cont ractual financial agreements. i. Social service organizations will provide culturally-specific approaches to health promotion, self-management for chronic diseases, and disease prevention. These approaches may include: 1. peer-to-peer health education programs 2. Community Health Workers b. Contracts will be based on a rate, ad justed to reflect the needs of the population, for serving a specified number of individuals in that population. i. Organizations will be accountable on measures of process and outcomes that will reflect realistic timelines of: 1. preventing chronic disease 2. promoting population health 3. chronic care management 4. attention to health literacy 5. accessibility to patients c. Contracts can be administered directly through the Health Fund Program or through a managed care organization. Recognizing that not every organization providing an integrated health care home is focused on serving vulnerable populations, an alternative should exist to renewable contracts that will enable a provider to purchase community-based and/or culturally-specific services. Recommendation: The Health Equities Committee recommends that high- value community-based health promotio n, disease prevention, and chronic disease management services, be eligible for direct reimbursement. Accountable health plans must reimburse a broader range of health professionals including, but not limited to, Community Health Workers, and a broader range of services including, but not limited to, peer-le d disease management support groups in culturally specific programs to maximize the he alth and function of individuals, families and communities. iii. Policy recommendations on providi ng incentives for healthy individual lifestyle choices 21HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 22Recommendation: Individuals purchasing health care with the assistance of a state subsidy will be provided with a Wel lness Account where the state will deposit cash incentives for behaviors th at will promote the individual's health. Some examples include: o Developing a wellness plan with provider o Meeting weight loss goals established in partnership with a provider o Participating in a smoking-cessation program o Getting recommended tests and procedures o Chronic disease management activities The Wellness Account is modeled after E nhanced Benefit Accounts (EBAs) that are currently being implemented in seve ral state Medicaid programs and are generally used to pay for covered Medica id services. Enhanced Benefit Accounts pay for benefits provided in addition to a beneficiary's Medicaid coverage, as an incentive to engage in healthy behaviors. Under an EBA, a process is established for verifying achievement or completion of the desired outcomes. Recipients or providers typically provide the verification. Once verified or established, recipients have access to account funds and these funds enable them to access additional services or products. IV. Reducing Barriers to Care Low-income individuals, who are dispro portionately communities of color, are uninsured and experience other barriers to health care. A comparison of comparable populations in the U.S. and Canada, which has a universal health insurance, revealed extreme racial disparities such as unmet health needs, forgoing needed medications, and lower perceived quality of care. 10 These barriers perpetuate health disparities as advances in biomedical knowledge and technology increase between people of higher and lower socioeconomic status based on access to valuable information and services to prevent or treat illness.11 i. Universal Eligibility Recommendation: It is a long-held Ore gon value that all Oregon residents have equal opportunity to support thei r families, pay taxes, and contribute to the State's economy. To maintain the heal th of that workforce, it is fair, wise 10 K.E. Lasser, D.U. Himmelstein, and S. Woolhandler, Access to Care, Health Status, and Health Disparities in the United States and Canada: Results of a Cross-National Population-Based Survey (American Journal of Public Health, 96(7):1-7, July, 2006). 11 D. Mechanic, Population Health: Challenges to Science and Society, (The Millbank Quarterly, 85(3):533-559, 2007). HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 23and in the State's economic interest that the Oregon Health Fund program shall be available to all Oregon residents. Although undocumented individuals demo nstrate less use of health care than US-born citizens, overall costs in healthcare are high as a result of poor access to primary and preventive care. 12 High and rising rates of the uninsured population contribute to excess relia nce on hospital emergency rooms and admission to the hospital for potentially preventable complications of chronic and acute conditions. Insurance gaps and benefit designs that discourage essential or preventive care contribute to higher longer-term costs of care and undermine quality by creating barriers to timely access to effective care.13,14 The Oregon Center for Public Policy esti mates that undocumented immigrants contribute annually to Oregon between $65 million and $90 million in state income taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes such as gas and cigarette taxes.15 Permanent documented immigrants are eligible for public coverage but are subject to restrictions and stipulations . The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 restricted documented immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996 from federa lly-matched Medicaid coverage for the first five years in residence. The Pew Hispanic Center estimated that Oregon's 2005 undocumented immigrant population was between 125,000 and 175,000. 16 Recommendation: As is consistent with current practices in the private marketplace, no citizenship documenta tion requirements will be in place to participate in the Oregon Health Fund program. In order for these two recommendations to be realized, the Committee felt that policy implementation options should be considered by the Oregon Health Fund Board. For example, a preferred option from the Committee would be: to establish an 'Oregon Primary Care Benefit Plan', or alternatively a health care pool, within the Gelberg, Health Care Access, Use of Services, and Experiences Among Undocumented Mexicans and Other Latinos , (Archives of Internal Medicine, 167(21):2354-2360, 2007). 13 S.

HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT Oregon Health Fund Program for non-qualifie d [legal immigrants who have been in the U.S. under 5 years, and individuals without documentation] Oregon residents who are unable to afford purchasing health care withou t a subsidy. Financing for this portion of the program could be structured so that industries employing non-qualified Oregon residents are directed to cont ribute through the \"play or pay\" requirement of the employer mandate. The Committee recognizes that this op tion faces the following challenges: If revenue comes solely from businesses rather than community support\u2014it may still prove to be economically infeasible; The administration of such a pr ogram may require limited state funds for implementation; Creating two entirely different programs based on eligibility creates equity issues; This program could be construed as implicit support for individuals who are not authorized U.S. residents; and, Businesses may oblige the \"play or pay\" requirement for \"recognized\" workforce and avoid \"unrecognized\" workforce unless the state actively identified individuals in the latter group. However, the Committee also maintains th is recommendation for the following reasons: The Oregon Health Fund Program wo uld be \"universal\" in that all Oregon residents will be included; No specific federal waiver would be needed if federal funds are not being utilized; Both \"cost-shift\" from uncompensate d care as well as public health concerns created by exclusion are addressed; Businesses that heavily rely on a largely immigrant workforce will be included in the employer mandate and would also directly benefit from participation; If the Oregon Primary Care Bene fit Plan is within the Oregon Health Fund Program it would combine all value-based purchasing advantages; and, Because it is less voluntary in design for employers and would therefore possibly prove to be more economically sustainable. The state would continue to benefit from federal dollars that support the Citizen Alien Waived Emergency Medical (CAWEM) program, providing reimbursement for emergency hospitalization costs, including childbirth. The alternative policy options the Committee considered: 24HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT Alternative 1: Non-qualified Oregon residents may purchase their own health coverage either through the private market or through the exchange and are ineligible for direct state contributions. Challenges: Oregon Health Fund Program would not be \"universal\" in that low-income, non-qualified Oregon residents would be excluded; This option doesn't address the \"cost-shift\" from uncompensated care as well as public health concerns created by exclusion; and, The \"play or pay\" amount from businesses employing non- qualified workers not provided to those workers. Advantages: No specific federal waiver would be needed; Option takes 'hot button' issue of immigration off the table as something that may stymie or pr esent a roadblock to bipartisan agreement for comprehensive plan; and, This option would be consistent with current public programs such as the Oregon Health Plan and the Family Health Insurance Assistance Program (which requires citizenship documentation). Alternative 2: All Oregon residents are to be el igible regardless of federal qualifications for state contributions to low-income individuals through the Oregon Health Fund Program. Challenges: No federal match would be available for these individuals and the program would be reliant on state contribution only; Inserts 'hot button' issue of im migration into the comprehensive plan that may stymie or present a roadblock to bipartisan agreement; and, Inconsistent with the Oregon Health Plan that requires citizenship documentation. Advantages: Oregon Health Fund Program woul d be \"universal\" in that all Oregon residents included; Addresses both the \"cost-shift\" from uncompensated care as well as public health concerns created by exclusion; and, The \"play or pay\" amount from all businesses going to all workers regardless of federal qualification. 25HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT Alternative 3: Establish an 'Oregon Primary Care Benefit Plan' within the health insurance exchange alongside the Oregon Health Fund Program whereby foundations, providers, managed care groups, targeted employers, counties, cities and others may continually contribute funds, on a voluntary basis, that will be appropriated to provide subsidies to individuals that do not qualify for state contribu tions but are unable to afford purchasing health care without them. Challenges: Not a guarantee of shared responsibility \"play or pay\" payment by businesses that employ non-qualified individuals; Voluntary basis of revenue source may provide an inadequate long-term economic feasibility, part icularly if large industries such as hospitality and/or agricultu ral choose not to participate; If not financially viable, fewer pe ople will be covered, violating universality due to enrollment caps; Creating two entirely different programs based on eligibility creates equity issues; State resources would be necessary for administrative costs due to eligibility determinations; and, Could be construed as implicit support for individuals who are not authorized U.S. residents. Advantages: Comprehensive plan would be \"u niversal\" in that all Oregon residents eligible; No specific federal waiver would be needed and no foreseeable problems with federal match; This option avoids contentious immigration debate that could weigh down the comprehensive pl an because new state dollars will not be appropriated for non-qualified individuals; This option would be consistent with the Oregon Health Plan (which requires citizenship docume ntation) for state contributions; Addresses both \"cost-shift\" from uncompensated care as well as public health concerns created by exclusion; and, This option allows a myriad of interested parties the opportunity to contribute to reduce the number of uninsured Oregonians ii. Address Citizenship Documentation Barrier Recommendation: Health Equities Committee Policy Recommendations on Citizenship Documentation Requirements for Participation in OHP-like Programs 26HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT The Health Equities Committee recommends inv estigating the possibility of obtaining a federal waiver exempting Oregon from the citizenship documentation requirements established by administrative rule, stemming from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2006. Oregon would request returning to previous documentation methodology employed by the Department of Medical Assistance Progra ms. Findings from a previous state audit demonstrated that this methodology was an effective mechanism for ensuring appropriate participation in Oregon Medicaid and Medicaid-expansion programs. iii. Targeted and Aggressive Outreach Recommendation: A media-only approach to outreach for the Oregon Health Fund program is not an adequate respon se to reducing health disparities in health insurance status in Oregon. A sustainable funding mechanism, with addi tional Medicaid matching funds, must support community-based organizations in delivering culturally-specific and targeted outreach and direct application assistance to members of racial, ethnic, language minority communities, individuals living in geographic isolation, and populations that encounter additional barriers such as in dividuals with cognitive, ment al health, deafness or sensory disorders, physical disabilities, chemical dependency, and individuals experiencing homelessness. a. These community-based approaches shou ld be collaborative rather than competitive among agencies that serve vulnerable populations. b. The Office of Multicultural Health and county health departments should have a key role in ensuring that barriers to outreach and enrollment are addressed at both the community and sy stem level and that those efforts are continuous and coordinated between the Oregon Health Fund Program, Department of Medical As sistance Programs, and community- based organizations involved in outreach. c. The Office for Oregon Health Policy & Research should evaluate the effectiveness of the county-based organizations specific to enrolling vulnerable populations. 100% enrollment of individuals who are e ligible to participate in the Oregon Health Fund program is the objective an d resources and interventions must be targeted towards this goal. iv. Cost-Sharing Recommendation: Promote equitable and fair sharing of health care costs within the Benefit Design. 27HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 28Health insurance coverage with high deductibles and out-of-pocket costs disproportionately hurt low-in come individual's ability to obtain needed care, further contributing to health disparities. Equitable cost-sharing policies take into account and attempt to minimize the uneven impact that cost-sharing arrangements may have on health care access. a. Include public contributions for those with low incomes to purchase health insurance, sliding fee scales for pre miums, and limits on copayments and other out-of-pocket costs so that people at the lowest income levels will face only nominal charges. Premiums ar e the preferred form of cost-sharing for public programs because people can regularly budget those costs. b. Benefits should be extended to al l Oregonians that protect against devastating financial losses and bankru ptcy due to unforeseen catastrophic illness or injury. c. Utilization and quality data should be regularly accessed to determine if cost-sharing policies are worsening or increasing health disparities. For example, cost sharing thresholds shou ld be evaluated to determine when and if those thresholds become barriers to necessary care. d. Design public programs for health ca re assistance that do not disenroll beneficiaries or deny primary care services to people who do not pay required cost-sharing costs but rather, maintain health coverage while taking action to collect debt. Oregon 's experience with administratively disenrolling individuals from its Me dicaid program who did not meet cost-sharing requirements led to ma ssive loss of coverage with adverse affect. Results from the baseline Oregon Health Plan (OHP) cohort survey indicate that nearly one half (45%) of the OHP Standard population experienced disrupted or lo st coverage in the first 10 months after the OHP redesign in 2003. OHP beneficiaries who lost coverage reported significantly worse health care as well as medication access and had significantly h igher medical debt than those with stable coverage. 17 V. Improving the Quality of Care i. Integrated Health Home Definition of Medical Home/Primary Care Home: A system of care that provides coordination of multiple, disparate elements of care for a patient. This does not assume that all care is provided within the walls of a clinic. 17 Carlson, Matthew J., DeVoe, Jennifer, Wright, B ill J. \"Short-Term Impacts of Coverage Loss in a Medicaid Population: Early Results From a Prospective Cohort Study of the Oregon Health Plan\" Annals of Family Medicine 4(5): 391-398, 2006 HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT Recommendation: Elements of the Medical Home model that have been demonstrated to reduce health disparitie s must be encouraged in any medical service organization purporting deliver y of a Medical Home include: a. Patient Centered Care focus i. Extended office hours: evenings and weekends ii. Alternative access to providers such as telephone consultations and email exchanges. iii. Automatic reminders of recomme nded visit schedule and appointment times. iv. Mental Health and Chemical Dependency Integration v. Emphasis on chronic disease ma nagement and preventive care vi. Coordination with community based social organizations, peer support networks and organizations that integrate social determinants of health into ca re including public health as appropriate b. Population based care: The Medica l Home should include systems to coordinate care of all patients in th e practice outside of office visits. Recommendation: For some populations, a medical home may be best provided outside of the traditional primary care service delivery system and a definition of medical home should not exclude organizations based on service- delivery type but should include coordination of care by a licensed medical provider. Recommendation: The Medical Home needs to be integrated and viewed in the context of the social and education system, hospital and specialty care system and public health system in a community. ii. Benefit Package Recommendation: Remove any financial barriers and increase reimbursement for preventive services, chronic dis ease management, patient education programs and after-hours/walk-in primary care. The benefit program designed should improve access to and utilizat ion of appropriate services in an integrated health home and support community-based organizations to assist in health promotion. The benefit prog ram should also reward patients who actively participate in their own care, through incentiv es for patients who follow through with the medical treatment plan agreed upon with their health care provider. Encouraging patients to receive treatment for early disease in the less expensive outpatient setting, rather than waiting until disease progression requires extensive inpatient care will 29HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT benefit both individuals and so ciety. The state should also encourage providers to expand availability to patients (e.g. operating du ring evening and weekend hours). Patient education programs can help reduce health ca re disparities by providing patients with skills to effectively navigate health care systems and ensure that their needs and preferences are met. For example, patient ed ucation programs have been found to be effective in reducing racial and ethn ic disparities in pain control. Recommendation: Support direct reimbursement for Community Health Workers (CHWs) for publicly sponsored health programs. Community Health Workers (CHWs), also known as promotores/as, Community Health Representatives (CHRs) , lay health advisors, and outreach workers, among other names, are trained members of medically underserved communities who work to improve he alth outcomes. CHW programs have proven effective in teaching disease prevention, reducing barriers to care, improving patient-provider communicati on, and improving community health. Oregon can stimulate these programs by pr oviding a variety of funding sources, including direct reimbursement. Estab lishing direct reimbursement may involve developing a certification system for CHWs . Any certification system should be designed and governed by CHWs and CHW advocates . Recommendation: Retain and utilize the Oregon Health Resources Commission (HRC) to analyze the cost-effectiveness of medical technologies and health services. The HRC should analyze the cost-effectiveness and health equity benefits of alternativ e and complementary medicine including, but not limited to, traditional Chinese medicine for the inclusion of such health services in the benefit design of publicly sponsored health programs. Many diverse communities in Oregon are not limited to allopathic medicine as the only form of treatment for illness. This is especially true for communities that have specific cultural sensitivity or preference for a type of alternative or complementary medicine that may reduce health disparities. At the same time, finite public resources should be spent on medical technologies and health services that are evidence-based. Recommendation: Ensure that Oregonians have access to affordable evidence- based alternative and complementary medicine. As noted above, alternative and comple mentary medicine can reduce health disparities by providing culturally spec ific approaches to improving health. These types of health services should al so be vetted by the same standards as allopathic medicine and promoted in th e commercial market of health care as allopathic medicine. 30HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT iii. Language Access The explicit goal of the following Health Equities Committee recommendations are to ensure health care services that are respectful of, and responsive to, the cultural and linguistic needs of Oregonians. Recommendation: Take advantage of growing technological capacity in Oregon by creating a state-wide pool of qualified, certified interpreters and organizations that may be able to utilize and build on technologies being developed for telemedicine or telehealth. State-wide pool would include partnerships including but not limited to hospitals, clinics, language bank companies, video interpreter services, an d community services, etc. a. As an example, partners in the pool could pay according to their percentage of services used the prior year. Recommendation: Coordinate with state-wide technology efforts, such as Telehealth, to build future infrastructure for the state-wide pool, including video remote interpreting for Deaf people. Recommendation: In planning for interp reter services, include organizations specific to ASL interpreters (such as the Oregon Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf), and disability/Deaf organizations (such as the Women with Disabilities Health Equity Coalition, and the Oregon Association of the Deaf) to ensure inclusion of video remote interpreting for ASL signers. Recommendation: Seek federal matching funds for interpreter services through Medicaid. This targets provider organizations that serve Medicaid patients by making interpreter services affordable. Promote video remote interpreting (and other te lehealth technologies) as a viable option for health care providers. Through a state plan amendment, make in terpreter services a covered service rather than an administrative service, there by eliminating the disincentive for providers to see non- English speaking patients. Recommendation: Use state regulation to impose mandates with funds to off- set subsequent costs: Any plan that participates in the Oregon Health Fund Exchan ge must pay for interpreter services. 31HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT Recommendation: Create education partnerships so that more health professionals are also certified interpreters. Oregon may be able to utilize existing partnerships through the Health Care Workforce Institute or other existing grou ps that work toward certification of interpreters. As much as possible, interpretation must be included in the health professional's job description, protecting the employee's time and reflecting their dual roles. Definitions based on the Healthcare In terpreter Oregon Administrative rules: \"Limited English Proficient\" (LEP) is a modifier used by the federal government to describe a person with limited English proficiency. \"Person with limited English profic iency\" means a person who, by reasons of place of birth or culture, speaks a language other than English and does not speak English with adequate ability to communicate effectively with a health care provider. \"Health Care\" means medical, surgical, or hospital care or any other remedial care recognized by state law, including mental health care. \"Interpreter Services\" is listening to a message of one language and providing an oral rendition of the same message in another language. An interpretation is to be complete and accurate and relay the meaning of the message from one language to the other, considering the context and the meaning of the whole phrase and not each word as if it were \"standing alone\" without context. \"Health Care Interpreter\" means a person who is employed as an interpreter working in health care who is readily able to communicate with a person with lim ited English proficiency and to accurately translate the written or oral statements of the person with limited English proficiency into English, and who is readily able to translate the written or oral statements of other persons into the language of the person with lim ited English proficiency. Health Care Interpreter further means any individual paid as an interpreter working in health serv ices, including mental health. As used in this section, the term \"employed\" means anyone who performs or is utilized as a health care interpreter whether it be in an hourly or salaried position, contractor, volunteer, or intern 32HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT iv. Workforce The following recommendations are designed to create an adequate workforce to meet the needs of the population, incl uding those living in rural Oregon, and will reflect the diversity of Oregonians. Recommendation: Expand educational institution capacity at health professional schools where more traini ng opportunities are needed across the board from community college to university and postgraduate levels. Oregon's health care provider shortage is also challenged by the population's growing diversity and the need to pr ovide culturally and linguistically competent care. Recommendation: Increase financial aid in health professional schools for students needing more financial aid of the right kind (grants, scholarships, loan forgiveness). a. Expand reduced tuition to Oregon r esidents pursuing careers at Oregon health care educational institutions with additional incentives for underrepresented populations. b. Offer loan forgiveness for providers wh o practice in underserved areas in Oregon or with underserved populations in Oregon. Ultimately, our patients pay the price wh en there are insufficient providers from backgrounds similar to theirs. Geographic, economic, educational, and cultural factors, with their effects on patient mortality, underscore the critical need for providers from disadvantaged backgrounds and with superior cultural sensitivity training, to improve health care for the underserved throughout Oregon. They will then be able to serve those who are now underserved, improving access to care. In addition, these individuals will function as role models for youth within their communities. Recommendation: Strengthen the pipeline to health profession schools; intervention needs to start early and focus on retention. Support mentoring program models that have been demonstrated to be effective in retaining students. The Health Equities Committee feels strong ly that educational and experiential support in pre-college, college and in health professional schools will enable more applicants from disadvantaged bac kgrounds to apply, gain admission and graduate into the health care workforce. 33HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT Recommendation: The previous recommendation must include convening all entities that are currently working on pipeline development issues so that efforts are coordinated, streamlined, and strategic in planning for the future needs of Oregon's population. a. The Oregon Health Care Work-Force Inst itute would be ideally suited for the role of convener. b. Entities that should be convened incl ude, but are not limited to, Allopathic and Naturopathic providers, dentists, mid-level providers, nurses, behavioral health professionals, allied and Community-Health Workers. Recommendation: Improve the climate for diversity at individual health professional schools by mandating cultural (including sexual and gender minorities, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable populations) and linguistic competence throughout the institution. This in turn will mean better patient sa tisfaction and medical compliance, with decreases in morbidity and mortality re lated to chronic diseases over time. Providing culturally competent services th at maximize the health and function of the individual results in lower spending on health care, as well as increased income from a more productive workforce. Recommendation: Utilize existing agencies to establish and report on diversity goals for health & hospital systems and h ealth care training institutions to the Oregon Health Fund Board on a biennial basis . Recommendation: Support Community Hea lth Worker programs that recruit and train members of underserved communities to provide culturally and linguistically competent health servic es within that community. Creating a culturally-competent workforce The final Health Equities Committee re commendation concerning workforce is that Oregon must have a provider workforce that receives the education necessary to provide culturally-competent and culturally-aware health care. Recommendation: Mandate a minimum level of educational credits for health care providers that must earned in coursework specifically designed to increase cultural competence and/or awareness. a. This can be part of initial licensure or as part of continuing education. 34HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT v. Data Collection In Oregon there is such a dearth of data related to race, ethnicity, and primary language in health care that it is difficult to identify, let alone address, disparities in health care access, health care utilization, disease status, and/or quality of care. Where data exists, sources of are difficult to combine or compare due to differences in definitions and data collection protocols. Recommendation: All health care providers and health plans participating in the Oregon Health Fund Program must be required to collect and report data on race, ethnicity, age-appropriate sexual orientation, gender, disability status, and primary language. These measures need to be included when assessing quality and ensuring transparency. In a recently issued report, Identifying and Evaluating Equity Provisions in State Health Reform (April 23 rd, 2008), the Commonwealth Fund urges states to strongly consider publicly reporting access and quality data that has been stratified by demographic characteristics to promote public accountability, inform the consumer base, support state efforts to evaluate disparities in health and to intervene as indicated (pg. 6). vi. Quality Initiatives Recommendation: In its role as convener and collaborator, the Quality Institute should be responsible for: o Training provider organizations a nd health plans on protocols for collecting race, ethnicity, and primary language data based on the highest national standards. This will ensure consistency and comparability among data sources, increase cultural competency, and reduce provider discomfort with collecting this kind of information from patients. o Developing a Health Disparities strategy that utilizes data to identify disparities and assist communities with evaluating interventions to reduce disparities. o Aligning resources to support quality healthcare across all demographic populations in Oregon. o Disseminating meaningful and accurate information on health quality and utilization of healthcare resources in a manner that is accessible and understandable to individuals from a variety of cultural, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. VI. Conclusions 35HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 36The social determinants of health must be acknowledged in any explicit effort to reduce health disparities. Social determ inants of health acknowledge that an individual's health is not solely understood by determining insurance status, by isolating the experience between patient and provider, nor can it be adequately addressed by focusing on individuals and individual responsibility. Health is more than health care. A review of popu lation health factors determined that non-medical factors (genetic predispositions, social circumstances, environmental conditions, and behavioral patterns) are responsible for a large proportion of preventable mortality in the United States, perhaps 85-90 percent. 18,19 In the acclaimed PBS documentary series, Unnatural Causes: Is Inequality Making Us Sick ?, Dr. David Williams aptly frames the scope necessary to truly address health inequities through social polic y: \"Housing policy is health policy, educational policy is health policy, anti-violence policy is health policy, neighborhood improvement policies are he alth policies. Everything that we can do to improve the quality of life of indi viduals in our society has an impact on their health and is a health policy\". Other states have acknowledged this by passing legislation giving members of the legislative body, or other policy- makers, an opportunity to request an assessment of how any proposed policy might impact the health of vulnerable populations. Health impact-assessment tools provide policy-makers with information to evaluate how education policy, housing policy, economic policy, land-us e policy (as examples) might benefit or harm the health of individuals, families, or communities. 20 The Health Equities Committee strongly encourages the Oregon Health Fund Board and other policy-makers to consider creating avenues for racial, ethnic, and cultural minorities to participate in an on-going effort to address health disparities in Oregon. These commun ities are the first to identify and understand the problems that affect them and will have the best ideas about how to address these problems effectively. Health care is experienced locally and solutions for health care dilemmas must be addressed by engaging, supporting, and allowing the impacted communities to lead the way. Finally, efforts to reduce health dispari ties can begin immediately, outside of health care reform, or as part of any staged implementation that involves expanding Medicaid.

Elements of the Medical Home model that have been demonstrated to redu ce health disparities and must be encouraged in any medical service organization purporting de livery of a Medical Home include: a) Patient Centered Care focus b. Extended office hours: evenings and weekends c. Alternative access to providers such as telephone consulta tions and email exchanges. d. Automatic reminders of recommended visit schedule and appointment times. e. Mental Health and Chemical Dependency Integration f. Emphasis on chronic disease management and preventive care g. Coordination with community based social organizations, peer support networks and organizations that integrate social determinants of health into care including public health as appropriate b) Population based care: The Medical Home HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 48Oregon Health Fund Board Health Equities Committee Recommendations Benefits Committee Delivery System Committee Eligibility & Enrollment Committee Federal Laws Committee Finance Committee should include systems to coordinate care of all patients in the practice outside of office visits. For some populations, a medical home may be best provided outside of the traditional primary care service delivery system and a definition of medical home should not exclude organizations based on service-delivery type but should include coordination of care by a licensed medical provider. The Medical Home needs to be integrated and viewed in the context of the social and education system, hospital and specialty care system and public health system in a community. There should be an on-going, substantial investment in public health activities that will prevent disease, and promote the health of Oregonians. We believe that part of this investment should be di rected towards using culturally-specific approaches to disease prevention and health promotion. Public health initiatives that target health disparities should be guided by members from the communities experiencing health disparities. a) The Quality Institute and the Public Health Department would provide data to support decision-making on establishing funding and program priorities. HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 49Oregon Health Fund Board Health Equities Committee Recommendations Benefits Committee Delivery System Committee Eligibility & Enrollment Committee Federal Laws Committee Finance Committee b) Priorities will likely vary by region. c) Multiple granting approaches should be used: i. Planning grants should be made available for regional collabora tives to develop around a proposed intervention. ii. Competing grants should be designed to encourage creativity and collaboration. iii. Non-competitive continuation grants should be available to maintain funding support for programs that have demonstrated success at meeting the goals of the grant. iv. Emerging Issue grants should be available for communities to develop strategies and interventions around newly identified problems impacting population health. Public health initiatives should be regional collaboratives consistin g of social service organizations, culturally- specific organizations, health care organizations , and other community partners and community-based organizations would apply for grants that address targeted disparities with community-driven and implemented approaches. a) Matching regional funds may be required. b) Funding should be administered in a way that supports the necessary steps to achieving HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 50Oregon Health Fund Board Health Equities Committee Recommendations Benefits Committee Delivery System Committee Eligibility & Enrollment Committee Federal Laws Committee Finance Committee targeted outcomes, and the outcomes themselves. Data & evaluation support will be provided through partnership with Public Health. c) Effective programs will be shared and problem-solving will be facilitated through convening regional collaborative leadership (in person or virtually) on a quarterly basis in learning collaboratives. Renewable contracts for pub lic health initiatives must be awarded to health care clinics that partner with culturally-specific social service organizations (including or ganizations that focus on Persons with Disabilities, GLBT populations, homeless youth or adults , and populations with low literacy and illiteracy) to provide an integrated health care home. Clinics that have established in-house capacity for culturally-specific approaches would not be required to contract out for services already being rendered. a) Partnership must includ e contractual financial agreements. b) Social service organizations will provide culturally-specific approaches to health promotion, self-management for chronic diseases, and disease prevention. These approaches may include: HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 51Oregon Health Fund Board Health Equities Committee Recommendations Benefits Committee Delivery System Committee Eligibility & Enrollment Committee Federal Laws Committee Finance Committee i. Peer-to-peer health education programs ii. Community Health Workers Contracts for public health initiatives must be based on a rate, adjusted to reflect the needs of the population, for serving a specified number of individuals in that population. a) Organizations will be accountable on measures of process and outcomes that will reflect realistic timelines of: i. preventing chronic disease ii. promoting population health iii. chronic care management iv. attention to health literacy v. accessibility to patients b) Contracts can be administered directly through the Health Fund Program or through a managed care organization. Accountable health plans must reimburse a broader range of health professional including, but not limited to, Community Health Workers, and a broader range of services including, but not limited to, peer-led disease management support groups in culturally specific programs to maximize the health and function of individuals, families and communities. It is a long held Ore gon value that all Oregon residents have equal oppor tunity to support their HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 52Oregon Health Fund Board Health Equities Committee Recommendations Benefits Committee Delivery System Committee Eligibility & Enrollment Committee Federal Laws Committee Finance Committee families, pay taxes, and contribute to the State's economy. To maintain the health of that workforce, it is fair, wise and in the State's economic interest that the Oregon Health Fund program shall be available to all Oregon residents. As consistent with current practices in the private marketplace, no citizenship documentation requirements will be in place to participate in the Oregon Health Fund program. Investigate the possibility of obtaining a federal waiver exempting Oregon from the citizenship documentation requirements established by administrative rule, stemming from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2006 . Request returning to previous documentation methodology employed by the Department of Medical Assistance Programs. Findings from a previous state audit demonstrated that this methodology was an effective mechanism for ensuring appropriate participation in Oregon Medicaid and Medicaid-expansion programs. A media-only approach to outreach for the Oregon Health Fund Board is not an adequate response to reducing health disparities in health insurance status in Oregon. A sustainable funding mechanism, with additional Medicaid matching funds, must support HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 53Oregon Health Fund Board Health Equities Committee Recommendations Benefits Committee Delivery System Committee Eligibility & Enrollment Committee Federal Laws Committee Finance Committee community-based organizations in delivering culturally-specific and target ed outreach and direct application assistance to members of racial/ethnic/language minority communities, individuals living in ge ographic isolation, and populations that encounter additional barriers such as individuals with cognitive, mental health, deafness or sensory disorder s, physical disabilities, chemical dependency or mental health condition, and individuals in homelessness. Community-based approaches to outreach should be collaborative rather than competitive among agencies that serve vulnerable populations. The Office of Multicultural Health and county health departments should have a key role in ensuring that barriers to outreach and enrollment are addressed at both the community and system level and that those efforts are continuous and coordinated between the Oregon Health Fund Program, Department of Medical Assistance Programs, and community-based organizations involved in outreach The Office for Oregon Health Policy & Research should evaluate the effectiveness of the county-based organizations specific to enrolling vulnerable populations.

FL, ID, IN, KS, MI In Florida, the state deposits funds for Medi caid beneficiaries into account to reward healthy behaviors, such as weight ma nagement, smoking cessation, and diabetes management. These funds could be used for hea lth care related expens es at a participating pharmacy and enabling them to access additiona l services or products identified by the Medicaid program. Idaho has two programs: participants in the Wellness PHA must keep child wellness exams and immunizations up to date in order to ea rn points. The Behavioral PHA requires that beneficiaries sign a \"personal responsibility co ntract\" to receive point s that is based on achieving specified goals that are verified by a state agency.

Delaware and Wisconsin Medicaid managed ca re contracts specify that health plans must comply with all existing Federal em ployment laws, including but not limited to Title VI. Illinois Medicaid and SCHIP programs must translate writ ten materials and provide free interpreters for beneficiaries. Massachusetts Medicaid has inco rporated all Culturally a nd Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) standards in the areas of language access servic es into its managed care contracts. Multilingual providers a nd skilled medical interpreters must be available for the most commonly used language s in each region of the state. The state has identified a need for tec hnical support for writing CLAS standards in language that is user-friendly for plans. New Jersey requires health plans to docum ent availability and access procedures for providers, telephone assistance, and interpre ter services; provid e 24 hour interpreter access; report on the linguistic capability of interpreters or bilingual staff; provide professional interpreters when needed; mainta in a list of interpreters who are on call; and provide other linguistic services to enrollees if they exceed five percent of those enrolled in the health plan's Medicaid/NJ Family Care line of business or 200 enrollees in the health plan.

HEALTH EQUITIES COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT 57Data and Quality Health Equities Recommendations Implementation States State Medicaid Examples Collect and report data on race, ethnicity, age-appropriate sexual orientation, gender, disability status, and primary language. These measures need to be included when assessing quality and ensuring transparency. Develop a health disparities strategy that utilizes data to identify disparities and assist communities with evaluating interventions to reduce disparities. Disseminate meaningful and accurate information on health quality and utilization of healthcare resources in a manner that is accessible and understandable to individuals from a variety of cultural, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. CA, GA, MA, NJ, NY, PA, SC, WA, WI The California Department of Health Serv ices and New Jersey Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services requir e health plans to conduct group needs assessments to identify health educati on and cultural and li nguistic needs and resources. Both states conduct annual evalua tion of services provided and proposed to meet this need. California plans must also assess and report on the linguistic capabilities of interpreters and employed and contracted staff. Massachusetts health plans must maintain an updated database on providers, to the extent available, about race, ethn icity, and language of enrollees. New York requires health plans to provide a list of participati ng providers, including their language capabilities, to enrollees and to take special language information into consideration in assignment of providers.
