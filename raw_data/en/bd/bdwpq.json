Different sampling protocols are appropriate for different modelling approaches at different spatial and temporal scales, ranging from detailed demographic models that require accurate estimates of seed production, clonal growth and survival as well as immigration and emigration to broad regional surveys making use of incidence data from thousands of local species lists. Studies of most herbaceous plants (often arable weeds or crops) are often at small spatial and temporal scales, focus on parameterizing demographic models, and are time-intensive and expensive. Recent work has used different sampling methods to parameterize new modelling approaches, with increasing success. Building on our [survey](survey), we will develop a toolkit of sampling protocols and modelling approaches that match the scale and details required for the identied research priorities. In parallel to the virtual meetings around the research priorities survey, we will contact participants who are interested in these methodological and statistical questions, and carry out a similar series of online discussions to discuss the best approaches for each question or group of questions.
