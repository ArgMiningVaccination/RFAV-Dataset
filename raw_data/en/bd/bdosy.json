I'm an Energy Healing Expert, published author, and the founder of Modern Ritual NYC.

I'm certified as a Reiki Master, NLP, Hypnosis, Yoga and Meditation teacher, and in my 12 years of professional practice working with holistic modalities such as sound healing and craniosacral work, I've developed my own Integrative Energy Healing modality. Here at Modern Ritual NYC, I specialize in guiding clients through a comprehensive healing process that delivers exciting, empowering results that go way beyond ordinary sessions.
