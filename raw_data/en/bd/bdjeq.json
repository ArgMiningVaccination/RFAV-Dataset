MGH: Final Research Paper 3 Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr. Nat Quansah for his guidance, exper tise, and diligence in assisting me with the completion of this research study. W ithout Dr. Quansah's leadership and willingness to assist at all hours of the day (and ni ght!), this paper would not be possible. I would also like to thank my generous and loving host family, RAKOTOMANGA, who are based in Ivandry. Their ongoing support, as well as their interesti ng dinner table conversations regarding traditional medicine, were inspirational to this st udy's development. On the topic of research, I would like to thank the three anonymous traditional birt h attendants and one anonymous allopathic provider of Andasibe, Madagascar. Their ti me and willingness to respond to my overwhelming slew of questions were vital to the c ollection of data in this study. Finally, I would like to thank my global health professors at The George Was hington University, namely Dr. Jim Tielsch, Dr. Victor Barbiero, and Dr. Ron W aldman. These scholars were the first to spark my interest in healthcare practice s around the world, and I will be forever grateful for their instruction and mentorship. Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 4 Abstract Unbiased literature regarding the strengths of traditional birth attendant s is lacking. While many international organizations have published data regarding the improving suc cess rates of allopathic interventions, there has been no acknowledgement or discussion of t he qualities that keep traditional birth attendants in practice. This study has aimed to identify the distinct values of traditional medicine that contrast most allopathic healthcar e practices. Through informal interviews with three traditional birth attendants and one all opathic provider in the rural region of Andasibe, Madagascar, the researcher unear thed some of the key differences between these practices' patient care before, during, and after childbirth. Results suggest that traditional birth attendants distinctly succeed in thre e main areas: a spiritual dimension to their skills, a highly personalized provision of care , and the embodiment of the cultural emphasis on reciprocity. With further research on these distinct values of traditional birth attendants, there may exist an opportunity to educate allopathic providers on the elements that their practices are lacking. Moreover, the devel opment of a balanced body of knowledge of the different strengths of allopathic and traditiona l medicine practice may in turn lead to a stronger, more integrated healthcare sys tem. Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 5 I. Introduction Traditional medicine is far from primitive. While some allopathic lenses denot e traditional medicine as outdated or even dangerous, others recognize the dis tinct value in traditional practices. Well-versed allopathic providers recognize that t he services they offer are in fact more impactful when complemented with traditional medicine. In fewer words, they appreciate the unparalleled results of an integrated system (Stee nkamp, 2008). For many allopathic medicine enthusiasts, however, there exists a lack of understanding of traditional medicine. One area in which medical 'experts ' are particularly undereducated is in traditional medicine's role with regards to childbirth. This introduction will outline existing literature on both general traditional medicine pract ice and traditional birth attendants, and will then explore the key gaps that exist in this lite rature. Through this introduction, it will be evident that further research on the distinct values of tradit ional birth attendants is both justified and necessary. A. Background Research on Traditional Medicine Practice at Large One must first have an understanding of existing knowledge surrounding traditiona l medicine at large. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as \"the sum total of knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs , and experiences indigenous to different cultures that are used to maintain health, as well as to prevent, diagnose, improve, or treat physical and mental illnesses \" (Unite for Sight, 2006). According to Unite for Sight, traditional medicine is often viewed in contr ast with Western \"biochemical theories of illness\" (although we know this is not entirely true ). Traditional medicine can include -- but is not limited to -- plant- and animal-based medi cine, massage therapy, light therapy, and other spiritual healing techniques (Unite for Sight, 2006). Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 6 It is important to recognize that literature does indeed exist to expla in the survival of traditional medicine in modern times. In many developing countries, particu larly in Africa, there exist more traditional healers than allopathic ones, the latter of w hich are highly concentrated in urban areas. This creates a clear geographical barrie r to allopathic care for rural patients. For example, in Uganda, \"the ratio of biomedical practitioner s to the population is approximately 1:20,000, while the ratio of traditional healers to the popula tion can be as low as 1:200\" (Unite for Sight, 2006). Furthermore, because Uganda has re cord of at least one traditional healer per village, more than 80% of the population seeks tr eatment from a traditional provider before seeking an allopathic one (Unite for Sight, 2006). Finally, countless sources report that many traditional healers consider themselves c alled to serve populations without demanding monetary payment (Unite for Sight, 2006). Thus, low-income patients who find allopathic care financially infeasible are likely to ta ke advantage of traditional services, even in the modern age. It is vital to note that the se arguments for traditional medicine's survival do not in any way override the clear argument of traditional medicine's cultural rootedness and importance. When a patient visits a traditional healer, the procedure followed can vary grea tly. Some traditional healers can sense the reason for the visit, while others dis cuss symptoms and medical history with the patient and his/her relatives. The healer's method of diagnosis relies upon what type of spirit the healer considers present, and the extent to which the he aler looks to the spirit(s) for guidance (World Health Organization, 2013). Healers a lso use different means to communicate with spirits, such as light, mirror, or even temperat ure. (World Health Organization, 2013). Once diagnosis occurs, traditional healers also use a variety of methods to tr eat patients and to prevent future illness. For example, some will provide herbal re medies, while others will include behavioral or spiritual recommendations. Many sources arg ue that one Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 7 strength of traditional healers in contrast to allopathic providers is their w illingness to participate in the various dimensions of patient recovery. Traditional medicine pr oviders rarely hand over a one-time-only prescription and send the patient out the door. I nstead, traditional healers believe that \"satisfactory healing involves not mer ely recovery from physical symptoms, but also the social and psychological re-integration of the patient into his/her community\" (World Health Organization, 2013). Finally, in addition to understanding the survival, diagnosis procedure, and treatm ent elements of traditional medicine, exploration of existing literature on the challenges facing traditional medicine is needed. Unfortunately, not a great deal of data is a vailable about worldwide challenges to traditional medicine. Figure 1 below, developed by the W orld Bank, is among the most comprehensive survey of its kind. This data helps demonstrate some of the key issues facing traditional healers in Kenya. Based on this self-re ported data, it is evident that traditional healers in Kenya face both technical and financial diffi culties during their time in practice (World Bank, 2011). These hardships have only been made worse by the increasing role of allopathic medicine in society, as without integration of practices, the two providers will remain fierce competitors.

Accessed online 20 June 2014. <http://siteresources.worldbank.org/HEALTHNUTRITIONANDPOPULATION /Resources/28 1627-1095698140167/KenyaContributionTradHealthMedFINAL.pdf>) Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 8 B. Background Research on Traditional Medicine Practice With Regard To C hildbirth Traditional caregivers during childbirth are most often referred to as t raditional birth attendants. Like traditional healers, these providers come from a variet y of backgrounds and levels of training. Some are general traditional healers in addition to being traditional birth attendants. Others have grown up learning the skills of traditional birth attenda nce from their mothers or grandmothers (Steenkamp, 2008). Depending on the style of traditional birt h attendance, some providers care for women and children well before, during, a nd after birth, while others only provide care on the day of the birth (Steenkamp, 2008). As part of traditional medicine practice, a great deal of traditional birth attendants ' work involves a spiritual dimension that is not seen in allopathic care. There is truly a lack of depth in any of the information surrounding these birth attendants in the literature, evidence that very few international actors whol eheartedly Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 9 support traditional medicine. In contrast to the small group of Western doctor s who value traditional medicine's qualities, barely any positive words are published surr ounding traditional birth attendants. For example, UNICEF published a report about the risks of traditional birth attendants, and urged other actors to join in on the educational training of these attendants for the sake of women's lives. In the report, UNICEF outlined i ts own efforts to re-educate the birth attendants in a pilot program, and in doing so, portrayed the t raditional birth attendant community as stubborn (UNICEF, 2003). The report read, \"Despite the reluctance of TBAs to promote or use the individual home birth kit, the kit has some important benefits including the active participation of women in planning for t heir delivery and ensuring it is as clean as possible. The kit also guarantees that each mothe r will have her own disposable gloves and plastic sheets. The kit should be continued to be promoted at village level\" (UNICEF, 2003). While these kits have indeed been proven b eneficial to health, the tone of UNICEF's publication hardly encouraged the Western world to support the traditional birth attendants mentioned. Similarly, a whole host of commentary websites and blogs have published artic les bashing the practices of these attendants. (While blogs and opinion articles a re not reliable sources of research, they have been vital to my review, as they demonstrat e the type of faulty information that is reaching the public.) For example, one post reads, \"Throughout A frican history, traditional birth attendants (TBA's) have provided maternity care for women despite having no formal training ... In the majority of cases the women are illiter ate and have learnt their skills from other TBAs or just through the course of their lives. They may consider themselves to be like private health practitioners, but can they spot complicat ions or cope with problems any better than you or I? The answer is, they cannot\" (Wor k the World, 2011). The articles goes on to list maternal mortality rates in traditional ly attended populations as Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 10 compared to developed countries, and urges African governments to ban traditiona l birth attendance. This research is not presented to argue that UNICEF or other mentioned source s are at fault for their concern for the risks of using uneducated childbirth attendants. Instead, it is presented to highlight their publications and to point out that some of the only literatur e available to the general public -- and to allopathic providers -- is negati ve in tone and intent. Almost no literature exists to fairly examine the beliefs and practic es of traditional healers, so it is not surprising that Western providers do not understand nor condone traditional practices. The clear lack of published material on traditional birth attenda nce (and it's values) are a cause for great concern. C. Justification of Research Evidently, there are several extremely large gaps in the unbiased liter ature regarding traditional medicine's role in childbirth. These gaps are particularly dan gerous because, without support from international implementers like UNICEF, traditional birth attendants will also be stigmatized by related funders, advocacy groups, and even rese arch organizations. Over time, in the public health realm, a lack of support from such infl uential bodies could lead to the extinction of this culturally and medically valuable practice. In order to combat this danger, quantitative research on the unique values of tradi tional birth attendants is necessary. An increased pool of unbiased quantitative rese arch would balance the amount of information available about allopathic and traditional medic ine, and could lead to a healthier understanding of how the two could better integrate in t he future. Thus, research on the distinct values of traditional birth attendants--as they diff er from those of allopathic medicine practice--is both justified and necessary to the sur vival of traditional birth attendants. Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 11 II. Methodology The methodology of background research focused review of print and online material s concerning traditional medicine and traditional birth attendants, as cited among references. It also specifically focused on the tone and intent of publications by international organizations, private researchers, and members of the general public, as also cited a mong references. Much of the researcher's overall understanding of traditional medicine practices , prior to conducting this study, was gained through lectures of the program SIT Madagascar: Tra ditional Medicine and Healthcare Systems. The methodology of conducting primary research included a series of informal interviews. The researcher conducted three informal interviews with reninjaza (traditional birth attendants) in the city of Andasibe, all of whom will remain anonymous f or their own privacy. (These will be referred to as Reninjaza 1, Reninjaza 2, and Reninja za 3 hereafter.) Each of the three reninjaza were interviewed with regard to antenatal care, birthing techniques, spiritual beliefs, and perspective on allopathic medicine practic e. Also note that data collection took place while other researchers were present to stud y separate elements of the traditional birth attendants' practices. Finally, the researcher also conducted one informal interview with an all opathic provider in the same community of Andasibe, who will also be kept anonymous. (This individual will be referred to as Allopathic Provider 1.) The purpose of this intervie w was to collect information on the allopathic provider's perception of traditional birth at tendants, and also to gather data on differences between patient care in the contrasti ng settings.

B. Allopathic Provider Interview Results A variety of information was gathered from the allopathic provider with regar ds to prenatal services, family planning services, and the hospital functions. How ever, most relevant to the traditional birth attendants research are the following com ments from the allopathic provider: 1. Four traditional healers total are registered with the hospital and are us ed for referral. One is also traditional birth attendant (Allopathic Provider, 2014). 2. If bones are broken, sometimes the hospital recommends the patient see a traditi onal healer for bone-setting instead because \"they have a gift.\" They do not ever refer to a traditional birth attendant for actual childbirth (Allopathic Provider, 2014). 3. Traditional birth attendants and traditional healers \"are not an equal\" to allopathic care (Allopathic Provider, 2014). 4. At the hospital, a normal stay for childbirth is three days. Women are admit ted when the birth is ready to occur. This is because the hospital does not have the capacity to hol d them for a full week (Allopathic Provider, 2014). Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 14 IV. Discussion As a result of this data collection, several conclusions can be synthesized re garding the distinct values of traditional birth attendance. These can be described in thr ee categories: Spiritual Dimension to Skills, Personalized Dimension to Care, and Cultural Dimension to Reciprocity. A. Spiritual Dimension to Skills All three reninjaza expressed a spiritual dimension to their skills. One reninjaza described receiving her skills directly from God (Reninjaza 1, 2014). According to her account, she prayed to God for the ability to heal her own children in order to avoid bringing them to the hospital. As a result of her prayers, she received a power in her hands to heal people and to assist them during childbirth. This reninjaza also mentioned that she knew of another reninjaza in a nearby city who also received healing power in her hands from God, but did not release the name (Reninjaza 1, 2014). Aside from this reninjaza , the other two reninjaza described an inheritance of the power to heal from a grandmother. Each told stories of how the power was passed on to them from their relative, and emphasized that they were chosen for the role, rathe r than choosing their own career path. Each also commented that the ancestral spirit was st ill present to assist in difficult diagnosis, whether through a vision or a dream ( Pers. Obs. ). Based on these interviews, it is evident that there exists a set of spiritual beliefs that are very unique to the skills of traditional birth attendants. This is a distinct value t hat sets traditional birth attendants apart from allopathic providers because it inherentl y incorporates the mind and soul into the body's ability to heal and be healed. Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 15 B. Personalized Dimension to Care Reninjaza evidently provide a personalized birthing experience for their patients. Two of the three reninjaza cited emotional support as part of their role during the pregnancy period, and all of them have discussed the use of massaging to bring both mental and physical comfort to their patients before and during childbirth ( Pers. Obs. ). Reninjaza also provide a personalized dimension to care by focusing on prevention of complication, either be fore, during, or after birth. One reninjaza described taking each patient's medical history into account before deciding which herbal remedies to administer (Reninjaza 2, 2014). She described the fact that if a patient is dishonest about medical history, she dre ams a personalized dream for that patient that instructs her to investigate furth er on the patient's history (Reninjaza 2, 2014). All three of the reninjaza describe giving personalized instructions to prevent complication in each patient, whether by instructin g her on cold bathing before the birth or on how to remain warm for several weeks following the birt h (Pers. Obs. ). It is also important to note that reninjaza provide a personalized dimension to care through attention and privacy. Each reninjaza identically described the length of care to last from the beginning of pregnancy (or before) through the first week of life ( Pers. Obs. ). This contrasts the information gathered from the allopathic provider, who desc ribed a 3-day stay beginning at the time of birth (Allopathic Provider, 2014). Furthermore, a ll three also disclosed that they always birth the child in private within the reninjaza's home, which is in direct contrast to many public rooms in hospitals ( Pers. Obs. ). Through these examples of emotional support, individualized instruction, length of care, attention, and privacy, it is evident that traditional birth attendants ar e marked by a personal dimension to care. Such individualized care in direct contrast to ma ny allopathic Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 16 medicine practices, and is a set of values from which allopathic providers c ould learn a great deal. C. Cultural Dimension to Reciprocity The flexibility of reninjaza in their service costs is a major cultural value. As evident in the table, each reninjaza described charging a small amount of money for services, and also mentioned that they still treat patients who are unable to pay the fee ( Pers. Obs. ). One reninjaza also mentioned that payment is a symbol of reciprocity, so when she provides this essential service to a family, they return the favor in the form of somethi ng essential, such as a chicken to eat or a small amount of money to use for clothing (Reninjaza 2, 2014). The se styles of payment are very distinct from allopathic providers' fixed price systems, but embodies the Malagasy value of mutual benefit in a personal relationships. IV. Conclusion The most commonly quoted definition of health was given by the WHO more than 50 years ago. It refers to health as '' a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity \" (World Health Organization, 2013). This definition is vital to our understanding of traditional birth attendance, a unique form of health care that addresses the natural life process of childbirth, rather than addr essing an ailment. It is hoped that, through this study, light will be shed upon the unique values of traditional bir th attendants' role, the potentials of an integrated care system, and ulti mately, the childbirth process as healthy element of the human experience. Baumgaertner, E. MGH: Final Research Paper 17 Though this study succeeded in highlighting the values of reninjaza , there is a great deal of research that is yet to be completed. An engaged allopathic audience would require more quantitative data collection in a much larger population. Future resea rch should also include a systematic survey of women who have used the services of reninjaza , as well as a larger number of allopathic interviewees. If this further research wer e to be carried out, there would exist an increased body of unbiased knowledge on the role of traditional medici ne practice in childbirth. There would also exist a useful resource for allopath ic providers to learn more about how they can appreciate and integrate the unique qualities of tr aditional medicine. In the words of Dr. Nat Quansah, \"It is in listening that we hea r, in hearing that we know, and in knowing that we understand\" (Quansah, 2001). With a new and unbiased understanding of traditional medicine, such allopathic providers would be more will ing to work together to \"plan a birthday party\" in a highly functional and integrat ed system.
