The show, titled \"Adaptation/Equilibrium,\" will be on display from September 7 through October 12, 2017. An opening reception will take place Thursday, September 7 from 4 till 7 p.m. with an informal gallery talk at 4:30 p.m. \"Adaption/Equilibrium\" is an exhibit of Oh's newest paintings in which she explores complex relationships in nature and their emotional and psychological impact. Using these non-objec - tive works, she explains her proc - ess: \"My paintings start with one shape at a time. I develop a painting vocabulary by meticulously painting many layers of oval shapes,\" Oh said. \"I then search for the delicate boundaries of the medium by intro - ducing subtle shifts in transparency, opacity, and brilliance of color and light. The sense of space in my paintings is derived from the multilayered accumulation of oval shapes.\" Alice Oh works using a unique artistic method that involves minimal planning. Instead, she focuses on allowing her paintings to develop naturally as a \"dialogue\" between the artist and her canvas. She often works on a series of paintings and/or drawings simultaneously. Greatly influenced by nature and biology, Oh is interested in the concurrence of macro - scopic and microscopic life. These new non-objective paintings are both complex and com - pelling. The artist has exhibited internationally, nationally, and locally. Selected venues have in - cluded the Yoshibishu Art Center in Japan, the Ceiba Grafica in Xalapa, Mexico, the Inter - national Fine Print Center in New York, the University of Hawaii, Franklin and Marshall College , Seraphin Gallery and others. Oh has also been the recipient of many prestigious awards \"Freckleface Strawberry\" at Players Club of Swarthmore Page 8 Find Great Arts & Cultural Events Inside!

The intrusion of a young journalist forces him to look back on the de - fining moment of his illustrious career. Thirty years earlier Edmund Kean, one of the great - est actors of his generation, collapsed on - stage at London's Theatre Royal, and Aldridge was brought in to replace him as Othello. The American-born Aldridge performs the role brilliantly, but the reactions of the cast and critics are divisive and complex - and the experience changes the course of Aldridge's life. Ira Aldridge was a real man. Born in New York in 1807, he began acting as a teenager at some of the earliest African-American the - ater companies. He immigrated to Europe to escape the prejudice and discrimination he experienced in America, making his London debut in 1825 and achieving critical success in Dublin, Edinburgh, and in the provinces. In 1833 he stepped into the role of Othello at the Theatre Royale in place of an ailing Edmund Kean. Critics savaged his per - formance, reflecting more their own prejudiced shock at seeing a black man play Othello as he wooed and then murdered a white Desdemona than an honest commentary on the merits of his performance. Aldridge played just two performances and was dismissed by the theater. He spent the next three decades acting professionally, mainly on the Continent, achiev - ing critical acclaim and earning numerous awards. Inspired by Aldridge's story, Chakrabarti has skillfully woven themes from William Shakespeare's Othello, the play-with - in-a-play, into Red Velvet. In both stories, white men feel threatened by the professional skills of a black man and by his physical interactions with a white woman. Chakrabarti shows how outsiders - Othello and Aldridge - are first valued and then rejected for their innovations and accomplishments, and how individuals who push their societies toward greater justice are often punished for their audacity. In launching its 2017/18 season with Red Velvet, the Lantern is putting down a marker for a season in which the signifi - cance of an inspired individual's actions - for good or evil - can have a disproportionate effect on family, community, soci - ety, and state. \"Every advance against prejudice and ignorance comes through the focused and determined efforts of indi - viduals who carve a path for others to follow,\" said Lantern Artistic Director Charles McMahon. \"Ira Aldridge was just such an individual, and his story is an inspiring example of artistry and humanity that changed that part of the world he moved through. He is one of innumerable heroes whose performances in a great drama are largely forgotten in the full - ness of time, but without whom we would live in an uglier, less hopeful world.\" Red Velvet director Peter DeLaurier is intrigued by the ways in which the characters Ira Aldridge and Ellen Tree, who play Othello and Desdemona in Red Velvet's Othello, move beyond their seeming tribal identities - Aldridge as an innovative African-American actor and Tree as a rising young white actress in an established British theater company - to forge a new kind of professional relationship, magnetically and passionately engaged while unencumbered by prejudice and tradition. DeLaurier said, \"the conflicts in Red Velvet between the tribalism of black vs. white and tradition vs. innovation explicit - ly invoke that theater is a political act. The contrast between the characters who show courage in the face of these con - flicts and the characters who sink into cowardice is what makes Red Velvet so compelling.\" Tickets for Red Velvet are $26 - $43 and will be available online at www.lanterntheater.org or by calling the Lantern Box Office at 215-829-0395. Student tickets are $15 in advance; $10 student rush tickets are available ten minutes before cur - tain with valid ID. Discounts are also available for theater industry professionals ($10 in advance or at the door), seniors 65 and up, groups of 10 or more, and U.S. military personnel.

And all of them found the experience quite rewarding. The ten young men and two chaperons spent a week in Tennessee working for Habitat for Humanity of the Greater Chattanooga Area, a locally organized and governed non - profit, ecumenical Christian housing organization that builds affordable homes in Chattanooga. They partner with volunteers and low in - come families to build hous - es that are sold at no profit and with no interest. \"I saw the service trip as an opportunity to help oth - ers not just in my local com - munity but in an area that I had never been to before,\" said rising senior Matthew Ferrie of Downingtown. \"It really helped me see that all over the country, and the world, millions of people are struggling.\" After getting settled at St. Paul Episcopal Church where the group slept in sleeping bags in classrooms, they attended an orientation on what to expect during their week of service. Their first project took place in ReStore, Habitat for Humanity's thrift store that benefits the organization and the people that it serves. The boys spent a day organizing and sorting dona - tions, cleaning up the stock yard, and landscaping. The next project took place in the organization's warehouse where the students worked on different parts of a house being built in the area. They spent two days sanding and painting siding for the outside of the house and cabinetry for the inside. Working on this project gave many of the students a sense of satisfaction knowing that they were helping to complete a family's home. \"What made this trip special for me was the day we worked in the warehouse, fixing, sanding, and painting cabinets,\" said Rising Senior Justin Chambers of Glenmoore. \"We were told the cabinets were going to a family that has never been able to afford a working or functional kitchen. It's that connection that made me feel the trip was very worthwhile.\" Rising Junior Luke Grycewicz of Phoenixville couldn't agree more. \"One of the most outstanding parts of our work in Chattanooga was when our supervisor told us the story of the family we were helping and how the people doing the con - struction could not complete the house without our help,\" he said. Their final project included a full day working on Habitat for Humanity's revitalization program in the poverty stricken Glass Farm District of Chattanooga. They started demolition on an abandoned building that once housed a thriving busi - ness. The goal was to renovate the space so that a new business could move in. They tore down walls, pulled up floor tiles, and in general demolished the space. By the end of the day the space was ready for the next phase of renovation. \"At the end of the day I wanted to be able to say that we as a team were able to accomplish something that will allow other people to achieve more in their lives,\" Ferrie said. \"The trip as a whole taught me invaluable lessons of accom - plishment and selflessness. While we were working throughout the day you realized that there are many people who are not nearly as fortunate as we all are, and that we should look to help others who are in true need.\" Although the main purpose was to do service, time was built into the trip for the group to explore the Chattanooga area, see some of the sights, go swimming and even take in a Chattanooga Lookouts minor league baseball game. Getting to know the area gave the boys a deeper understanding of the needs of those living there. It also provided an opportunity for the boys to bond with each other. \"It was both a tough and rewarding week,\" said Faculty Member and Chaperon Mr. Dylan Gavin. \"The boys were exposed to people who were less fortunate then they are and they realized that even the smallest amount of help can go a long way.\" Devon Prep is a private, catholic, college preparatory school for boys in grades six through 12 focused on the holistic education of young men for life.

Andr\u00e9s Martin, MD, MPH, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and editor-in-chief of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry's (AACAP) scientific journal, is leading this ride to raise aware - ness of the challenges faced by children with mental illness - es. This amazing effort will span 5,000 miles, 24 states, and 60 grueling days, beginning in Seattle, WA, on August 17, 2017. Children's mental illnesses are real, common,and treatable. Yet today in the United States, this vulnerable population is caught in a vicious cycle of limited access to care, delayed treatment, and worsening illnesses. The fact is there are over 15 million children currently in need of the expertise of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. That's 1 in 5 of America's youth. Sadly, there exists an extreme shortage of trained child psychiatrists to treat this population. Through Break the Cycle, the goal is to raise awareness and needed funds to support innovative research initiatives, help increase the number of practicing child psychiatrists, and ensure children suffering in silence get the treatment they need. Over $149,000 has been raised to date in support of children's mental health. Local communities across the country are organizing events to show their support of this ride and cause. Children's men - tal health champions in Seattle, WA, and Portland, OR, are starting important conversations about these real, common, and treatable illnesses in their communities. The time for change is now, and that is why AACAP is supporting Dr. Martin's ambitious and inspiring journey.

This remarkable hands-on exhibition offers an amazing array of authentic dinosaur eggs and nests collected from around the world, including those of each of the major plant- and meat-eating dinosaur groups. \"Tiny Titans\" presents new discoveries about dinosaur repro - duction and behavior and intro - duces some of the fascinating peo - ple and science behind these dis - coveries. The exhibit is in both Spanish and English and will be on view at Phila - delphia's dinosaur museum from Saturday, September 30, through Monday, January 15, 2018. This multi-media experience gives credence to what is now widely ac - cepted among scientists: that dino - saurs and birds are closely related. Each science-rich section is enhanced with exciting lifelike models of embryos and hatch - lings and colorful illustrations of dinosaur families. A captivating experience for all ages, \"Tiny Titans\" invites visitors to: Touch a real dinosaur bone and cast nests, one more than eight feet in diameter. Dig for dinosaur eggs in interactive dig pits. Dress up and be a dinosaur parent protecting its nest of eggs. Get up close with exciting lifelike models of embryos and hatchlings. View stunning photographs and videos featuring promi - nent dinosaur experts. The outstanding collection of real fossils includes an authen - tic bowling ball-size egg of a sauropod from Argentina that was laid by a long-necked, plant-eating titanosaur that lived 75 million years ago. Visitors also will see a large cluster of eggs laid by a duck-billed, plant-eating dinosaur, and the long - est dinosaur eggs ever discovered - almost 18 inches long - laid by a new giant species of Oviraptor, a carnivorous, ostrich- like dinosaur. A central feature of the exhibit is a presentation about the discovery of \"Baby Louie,\" the nearly complete skeleton of a dinosaur embryo with its bones aligned in the proper posi - tion. The embryo, discovered in China in 1993, was nicknamed \"Baby Louie\" after photojournalist Louie Psihoyos who pho - tographed it for National Geographic. In May 2017 it finally received an official name with the publication of a study in the journal Nature Communications: Beibeilong sinensis, or \"baby dragon from China.\" Some of the real dinosaur eggs featured in that May 1996 issue will also be on display in this exhibit. \"Tiny Titans\" was organized in association with the Har - vard Museum of Natural History, The University of Tennessee and the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History.

Starring as Freckleface is Amelia SanFilippo, a senior at Springfield High School. \"Kids can be extremely mean by making fun of the way you look, from typ - ical things like your weight or things you weren't even insecure about until they teased you about it. Like, how big and frizzy/curly your hair is. But real - ly I would tell myself that you don't need to surround yourself with those people but rather people who accept you for who you are. Also if you like how your hair looks or you don't mind your 'unique physique', then don't worry about what everyone else says. You are you and people will love you no matter what,\" SanFilippo says. Also featured are Alicia Alaimo (Wilkes Barre), Conor Barr (Media), Justin Caiazzo (Ply - mouth Meeting), Madalyn DeFelice (West Chester), Elise Marx (Havertown), Jaime Metzger (Media), and Joanna Volpe (Roxborough).

The cast encourages children and parents alike to attend \"Freckleface Strawberry.\" Actor Caiazzo says, \"Far too often, kids and adults get wrapped up in how they look or what looks cool and they strive to not be different. This musical show that different is not only ok, but it's wonderful!\" After the performance, the audience can enjoy juice and cookies and meet the charac - ters.

Board Certified Aesthetic Physician Member of American Society of Bariatric Physicians Body by did it mean to our grandparents? What will it mean to our grandchildren? WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR OUR ancestors to say goodbye to the shtetl, to set out to discover new lives for themselves, along with all of the liberties the free world had to oer? At the dawn of the enlightenment, how did our parents adapt their Judaism to the developments of a modern age? And what can we learn from their struggles, in order to connect more deeply with our own Jewish identities? Join a new six-session course from The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute \" JOIN US FOR /T.swsho /B.swshe a /J.swshe/w.alt /F.swsh/r.altee /W.swsh.3orl/d.alt2 Jewish Identity Through the P. Suter Band to Perform at Gwynedd Mercy University on Feb. 7 \"Our Lady of 121st Street\" Opens on Second Stage at the Players Club of Swarthmore By Joyce Eisenberg and Ellen Scolnic Remember when macaroons, the coconut Passover treat, came in only vanilla and choco - late? Now the supermarket displays are stocked with choco - late almond, chocolate dip - ped, chocolate chip, chocolate chunk, and doubly choco late gluten-free. Choosing one is almost as confusing as decid - ing whether our teeth need the toothpaste with \"advanced whitening\" or \"tartar protec- tion.\" We've been known to stand before the drugstore sham- poo display paralyzed with indecision. Is our hair fine or limp? Do we need \"Truly Re - laxed\" or \"Curl Control?\" Most - ly, we're just glad to wake up and find that we still have hair. We should probably go with \"Age Defy,\" which promises to \"turn back the strands of time.\" These days, there are more choices than ever - and it's both wonderful and exhausting. We understand how Russian immigrants, for whom shopping used to mean standing in a bread line, felt when they entered an American supermarket for the first time and were bewildered by the variety and abundance of consumer goods. Shopping requires some soul-searching. To buy chicken broth, we have to weigh the rel- ative evils of fat, salt, chemicals and chickens that haven't been allowed to roam free. The problem is solved when we find a box that promises none of the above - at twice the cost. We also have to debate the merits of tried and true vs. something new. That turns out to be easy: The brand-new, \"light whole wheat Bran Matzos\" don't even tempt us. We'll stick with the plain kind. After we navigate the grocery aisles, we realize that with Pesach coming, we have way more than four questions: 1. Do we have enough room to include Uncle Harold's \"lady friend\" this year? 2. Where exactly should we put that orange on the seder plate? 3. Will our family want the same-old haroset (the apple-wine mixture) or would they enjoy an exotic Sephardic version? 4. Should we finally buy new prayer books or use the raggedy old ones. There are thousands of haggadot - the prayer book that details the songs and order of the Passover seder - in existence, from an ecological haggadah that asks us to think about the four trees to a feminist haggadah that focuses on the contributions of Miriam, Sarah, Rachel and other women in Jewish history. Other haggadot themes include LGTB, interfaith, and hip-hop (for those who want their Jewish tunes written by rap artists).

Memories of family and friends gathered as the four cups of wine are poured, the four questions asked and the Matzah served, all contribute to Passover's popularity in the Jewish community. Bringing the warmth and tradition of this festival to the Wynnewood Community, Chabad of Penn Wynne is inviting all residents to participate in community Seders to be held on Monday night, April 14, at 8 p.m. at the Kaiserman, JCC 45 Haverford Rd., Wynnewood PA. The Seders take participants through the wondrous liberation of our ancestors from Egyp - tian bondage, while sharing the relevance and beauty of the age old festival in our modern lives. Included in the Seder will be a full catered dinner, fine imported wine for the 4 cups, and handmade round 'Shmurah' Matzah from Israel. \"Passover is not simply a celebration of the historic liberation of an ancient people,\" said Rabbi Moshe Brennan, of Chabad of Penn Wynne. \"Passover is about our own personal lib- eration - physically, emotionally and spiritually. Passover inspires us to break free from the shackles restraining us from reaching new heights - in our lives, relationships and con- nection with G-d.\" All are welcome to join the community seder, regardless of Jewish affiliation or background.

People wrote on a dry-erase sign and shared a \"selfie\" photo to the nationwide hashtag campaign #NLW14 #LivesChange. The stories included a high-school student recalling memorizing her library card number before she knew her phone number, a pre school - er writing that reading books about dinosaurs makes him feel like he is \"living with the dino - saurs\" and a community patron sharing his dream of one day becoming a librarian. \"Dreams are discovered in libraries and libraries provide a path for those dreams to come true,\" says Murphy. Kackie St. Clair, head of the Friends Free Library, says, \"Libraries are a place to connect your knowledge and your curiosity to the worlds be - yond the library walls; and a much-needed place for some peace and quiet.\" At the FFL, the staff assists com - munity mem- bers with com- puter skills, writ - ing resumes and filling out job applications.

Dr. Randall Detra, associ - ate professor of science and technology, will have a tele - scope and two binoculars, all equipped with solar filters, in St. John Neumann Circle when the eclipse begins. He will share his equipment with any curious observers who join him at that time. According to Dr. Detra, \"This total eclipse will follow a narrow track starting in the north - west (Oregon) and run diagonally down through South Carolina. At our longitude this eclipse will occur between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. Of course, Neumann University is nowhere near this total eclipse track, but we can still expect to see approximately an 80% blockage of the sun at that time.\" Dr. Detra's equipment provides a safe method of viewing the eclipse as the moon blocks out light from the sun. \"Do not disregard what harm looking at the sun can do to your eyes without certifiable eye protection,\" he warns. \"Galileo did this and permanently blinded himself.\" Of course, the opportunity to view the eclipse is completely dependent on the weather.

Cyclists and spectators are encouraged to participate in the food drive by bringing their donations of canned goods and non-perishables - specifically cereal, peanut butter, jelly, canned tuna and canned chicken - to the Race on the August 20. Donation collection sites will be located throughout the course.

Summer Adventure campers engage with Jim Bobb, the Arboretum's beekeeper, to learn more about the roles of flowers, nectar and worker bees in the honey-making process. Photo/Tiffany Stahl With the approach of National Honey Bee Day on August 19, Morris Arboretum reflects on the importance of bees to the garden. More than 12,000 labeled plants in the Arboretum's living collection are pollinated by bees. Not only do bees pol- linate the majority of plants world-wide, but about one-third of an individual's daily diet as well. In fact, a sizeable percentage of edible harvests require a visit from bees to form fruits, nuts, seeds for vegetables, and other crops. And this yield often nourishes the next level in the food chain such as livestock, which produces or becomes another staple for human consumption. Since bees are so vital to the return and quality of crops, farmers often set up hives close to their fields to ensure pollination. At the Arboretum, 26 hives are stationed at Bloomfield Farm for just this reason. Jim Bobb, the Arboretum's beekeeper, owns and manages these hives for plant pollination and honey production. The garden's honey, Morris Gold, is harvested and bottled in the spring by Bobb and a community of beekeepers, and sold in The Shop. The average honey surplus in Pennsyl - vania, is 30-45 pounds per hive, but the Arboretum's final product is less due to the many challenges in maintaining bee health. The Arboretum's type of honey is known as wild-flower. It has a light and floriferous taste, since bees collect nectar and pollen from a variety of plants in a one to two mile radius. In other states, for example, Florida and California, where there are huge farms of one crop and bees visit only one type of flower, the honey has the flavor of that plant, such as orange blossom or clover. Education is large part of the Arboretum mission, and Jim Bobb and his bees are involved in many hands-on outreach programs to local schools. Summer Adventure campers also engage with Jim to learn more about the roles of flowers, nectar and worker bees in the honey-making process. Interested in setting-up a hive on your rooftop or in your backyard? Morris Arboretum is offering a Bee Keeping 101 class on September 23. Learn all the how-to's about this fasci- nating hobby and enjoy the many sweet rewards of your efforts. Morris Arboretum is a 92-acre horticultural display garden that features a spectacular collection of mature trees in a beautiful and colorful landscape. The official arboretum of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, effective 1988, Morris Arboretum is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and accredited by the American Association of Museums.
