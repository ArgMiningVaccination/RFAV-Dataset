In my class were members Michael Puzak andJames Bunce, noted on the In Memoriam pages of the Yale Medicin e that recently arrived in my mailbox. In the same issue, I read of the growing popularity of unregulated alternative orcomplementary treatments(\"Use of alternative medicinewidespread among mentallyill,\" Et cetera , Fall | Winter ). I would prefer to call them unscientic or unproven. My particular interest in retirement has been the expo-sure of the alternative careknown as chiropractic. Thereare some chiropractors, legally calleddoctors, with , new grad- uates every year, compared to, medical graduates. In a survey of medical collegedeans, termed the subluxa- tion and adjustment theory to be false. I witnessed a stu-dent perform an adjustment of the neck and back at onechiropractic college, and wasappalled. I have written abook to challenge this treat-ment titled Chiropractic: The Greatest Hoax of the Century?Yet the practice flourishes.Things were not so, way backin my student days of ' .

Good communication\u2014between doctorand patient, mentor and medical student\u2014is also an idea running through John Curtis'portrait of the Wednesday Evening Clinic(\"Learning for the Long Run,\" page 28). But theissue's theme was completed when fourth-year medical student Sharon Chekijian filedher letter from Armenia (\" Adrenaline and the Ordinary, in Varying Proportions,\" page 34),describing the state of health care in her family's ancestral homeland. Her observations,gathered over the course of a decade and ahalf-dozen visits to Yerevan, reveal a differentrhythm for medicine in this ex-Soviet state,where doctor and patient may toast the success of the operation together and where the surgeon's fee may be paid in livestock or potatoes.

One of the national e ort's main failures, the report said, isin the allocation of preven- tion resources. Money for pre-vention follows reports of cases, but because incu- bates for years, this approach yields old data. \"It rewards peo-ple for counting cases of instead of preventing infections,\" Kaplan said. The report proposed a six- pronged prevention strategy.Allocation of resources shouldtarget not reported cases, but estimates of new in- fections through anonymoustesting of \"sentinel groups,\"such as drug users in treatment.Evaluations of existing pro-grams should determinewhether interventions work. prevention counseling should reinforce preventionmessages among those alreadyinfected. Research and inter-ventions should strengthenlocal capacity to implementeective programs. Federal agencies should continue toinvest in prevention.

What it found was unsettling: a lack of coordina-tion among federal agencies,funding of interventions thatshowed no evidence of success,reliance on political rather thanscientic criteria for fundingand, perhaps most startling, no clear goal for prevention. \"Despite the fact that we know so much about how toprevent ,\" said Michael H.

Under cur-rent funding, the committeeestimated that a reallocation of resources could reduce newinfections by percent. And interventions currently deniedfederal funding, such as needleexchange programs and com-prehensive sex education, couldprevent even more infections.\"That is probably the mostimportant thing to realize,\" saidthe other Yale faculty memberon the committee, Edward H.Kaplan, .., a professor of both management sciencesand public health. \"You canget better results not only byincreasing the budget, but alsoby changing the allocation.\" The committee was estab- lished by the Institute of Med-icine at the request of the Cen-ters for Disease Control andPrevention, which wanted tohave a prevention frameworkNo time to lose A high-profile panel criticizes national efforts to fight AIDS/HIV. \"Despite the fact that we know so much about how to prevent HIV infec-tion,we can't get the job done, \" saidpublic health Dean Michael Merson,top,one of two Yale faculty memberson a committee that examined thenation's AIDS prevention strategy.

Reflecting this,the prac-tice announced in March that it ischanging its name to the YaleMedical Group. According toDirector David J. Leffell,M.D.,HS'86,the school's senior associatedean for clinical activity,\"the words 'faculty practice' suggested to some people that care was deliv-ered by interns and residents whowere practicing to become physi-cians. The new name conveys aclear message about our academicmedical group and the clinicalcare we provide.\" 4chronicle After an uproar,price of AIDS drug falls in Africa A drug discovered in a Yalelaboratory made headlines thisspring in the ongoing debateabout the provision of medications in the ThirdWorld. The physicians' groupDoctors Without Borders calledon the University, which holds the patent for d T, and Bristol-Myers Squibb ( ), which has a license to marketit, to allow cheaper or genericversions to be sold in Africa. Ata cost of between $ ,and $,a year, antiretroviral therapy is out of the reach ofmost of the million people in sub-Saharan Africa whohave and the .million who are infected with . said in mid-March, after discussions with the Uni-versity, that it would make itstwo drugs, d T and ddI, available throughout Africa for$per day and allow generic versions to be sold as well. The issue surfaced when an Indian pharmaceutical com-pany, Cipla, made an o er to provide triple-therapy cocktails at $ per year per patient in developing coun-tries. That package includeddT at cents a tablet. Doctors Without Borders, however, \"It's one thing as a parent to watch your own children grow,\" Dean DavidKessler told the crowd gathered out-side the Congress Avenue Building onMarch 21,\"but I must say,as dean,it isquite another to watch this babygrow.\" The dean thanked city and com-munity leaders and iron workers,whogathered with faculty members,stu-dents,alumni and project staff as theworkers lifted the highest piece ofstructural steel in the 450,000-square-foot building's massive frame intoplace. An American flag and an ever-green tree were welded to the 1,000-pound beam for good luck,and ironworkers and others signed the beam,right,before it shot skyward at the endof a crane. All told,7, 000 pieces of steelweighing 3,500 tons went into theframing,which was completed duringthe course of several exceptionallysnowy months. \"It seemed like the win-ter didn't want us to nish this job,\"said Otto Del Medico,the superintend-ent of Iron Workers Local 424. \"Wefought the weather every day.\" Whenjohn curtis (2)\"Topping off \" the Congress Avenue Buildingwas unwilling to distribute the generic drug because of con-cerns over infringement ofpatent rights in South Africa.The humanitarian grouppressed both the University and for a solution, and Yale students later joined in calls forprice relief.

In recent years the drug, knowngenerically as stavudine andmarketed as Zerit, has broughtYale about $ million a year in royalty income.

Wewere interested in developing acompound that would be abenet to society,\" Pruso said. \"The purpose of the site is to support research on the integrative actions of neurons and circuits,in the same way thatthe Human Genome Project has so effectively supported research on genes and proteins.\" \u2014 SenseLab Director Gordon Shepherd yale medicine spring 2001 7 6et cetera GGG chronicle In recent years, the state of knowledge about the humanbrain\u2014whether at the level ofmolecules, cells, or entire signal-ing pathways\u2014has increased somuch that it has given rise to awhole new eld of study. Thescience of neuroinformaticslooks for ways to sort and storethese floods of data that willkeep them widely accessible,open to interaction with otherdata and amenable to continu-al revisions and updates. A bigstep forward took place inOctober, when the -sup- ported Human Brain Projectawarded a $ .million grant to the School of Medicine forthe establishment of a multi-purpose, neuronal database onthe World Wide Web. The four-year e ort of developing the site, known asSenseLab (senselab.med.yale.edu), is headed by Gordon M.Shepherd, ..,.. , neurobiology, .., professor of anes- thesiology and director of theYale Center for Medical Infor-matics, and Michael Hines, .., research scientist in the departments of Neurology andComputer Science. \"The pur-pose of the site is to support re-search on the integrative actionsof neurons and circuits, in thesame way that the Human Ge-nome Project has so e ectively supported research on genesand proteins,\" said Shepherd. Within this Web site, users can work with data from eachof SenseLab's ve databasesinteractively. The andion channels, olfactory genesand their proteins, and odorManaging complex data about the brain molecules. In addition, users may search the databases byneuron or category of neuron,as well as by neurotransmitter,receptor or electrical current.Eorts are now under way to enhance the site with links tobrain atlases on the Web andto other databases, such asarchives of brain images and ofthe anatomy of di erent types of neurons. The Yale scientistsare also developing more e ec- tive ways to add data from elec-tronically published journalarticles into the SenseLab data-bases by means of automaticsearch tools. In Shepherd'sview, \"It's an exciting time to bein on the creation of a new eldthat will be crucial to futureresearch in neuroscience.\" Last fall when the World Health Organization began negotiat-ing a new global treaty aimedat curbing tobacco use, partic-ularly among young people,Sir Richard Doll, .., .., looked on with a great deal of satisfaction. In , Doll published the rst convincing evidence thatsmoking was the cause of lungcancer. This was during an era when a physician might tryto calm a patient's nerves byoering a cigarette. Doll, a smoker at the time, had specu-lated that rising lung cancerrates might have to do with theincrease in the number of carson the road. Through pain-staking epidemiological work,however, he and his colleagueSir Austin Bradford Hill found and documented thelink to tobacco. This and Doll's lifelong con- tributions to epidemiology andpublic health\u2014including thePioneer in tobacco research receives rst Winslow Medal understanding of peptic ulcer disease, the health e ects of oral contraceptives and the role ion-izing radiation plays in causingleukemia\u2014prompted the YaleUniversity School of PublicHealth to make Doll the rstrecipient of the C-E.A. Wins-low Medal in mid-October. The medal is given in honor of Charles-Edward AmoryWinslow, who established Yale'sDepartment of Public Health,as it was known when it wasfounded in , and is regarded by many in the United Statesas the founder of the moderndiscipline of public health. Dur-ing his tenure at Yale, Winslowexpanded the denition of pub-lic health from the narrowconnes of public hygiene toinclude the prevention andcontrol of heart disease, can-cer, stroke, mental illness anddiseases associated with pover-ty. According to parasitology andvirology, and public healthexperts began to recognize thesocial aspects of sickness. Merson said Doll was selected as the rst recipient ofthe medal because he is the\"foremost epidemiologist ofthe second half of the th century.\" Doll's papers, whichare \"classics because of therigor in their study design, theelegance of their analysis, andthe clarity of their reporting,\"established his reputation asthe \"epidemiologist's epidemi-ologist,\" Merson said. During the course of his career, Doll refrained fromspeaking out against tobaccocompanies because, as he saidin an interview, \"my job was todo the research and make evi-dence. ... The active research worker has to disassociate him-self from the steps that are takenas a result of his research.\" Butnow that he is no longeractively researching the tobac-co issue, he is happy to give hisopinion on the continuedeorts of those in the tobacco industry who market theirproducts to youth. \"It's like selling heroin,\" he said. \"One happens to be legaland the other isn't, but theyare both equally morally evil. Idon't object to the manufactureof it. We're not going to stopthat overnight. What I objectto is its promotion, encourag-ing people to use it.\" Doll, who received his medical degree in and his doctor of science in from the University of London,considers his work on tobaccoto be his greatest professionalaccomplishment. Formerly the director of the UnitedKingdom Medical ResearchCouncil's Statistical Unit, Dollwas appointed the Regius Pro-fessor of Medicine at the Uni-versity of Oxford in . At Oxford he also directed theCancer Epidemiology and Clin-ical T rials Unit, and has con-tinued to work with the unitsince his retirement as a pro-fessor in .

This was during an era when a physician might try to calma patient's nerves by offering a cigarette.parental prospects A national survey of 3,000 adults, one-thirdof them parents of young chil-dren,found a surprising lack ofunderstanding about basic princi-ples of child development. Accord-ing to the survey,many parentsspank their children althoughthey know it 15-month-old to share,even though that doesn't happenuntil children are at least two.\"Parents seem to think develop-ment is some sort of race.

That was wherethe heaviest fallout occurred out-side of the immediate area sur-rounding the Chernobyl powerstation following the meltdown ofone of its nuclear reactors 15 yearsago this spring. Along with Clini-cal Professor of Medicine NicholasDainiak,M.D.,van Hoff has sinceworked with the InternationalConsortium for Research on theHealth Effects of Radiation tostudy childhood leukemia in theregion. The results have been sur-prising. \"While the social effectson people within the area havebeen very signicant,\" says vanHoff,\"the physical impact of radia-tion exposure has been small.There has been a remarkableincrease in rates of thyroid cancerfor individuals exposed as chil-dren. However,there has been nodetectable effect on the rates ofother cancers to date.\" race not a factor Race did not affect the quality of psychiatriccare or clinical outcomes in astudy of white and African-Ameri-can patients who were homelessand mentally ill.

Rosenheck,M.D.,HS '77,profes-sor of psychiatry and public health.The ndings depart from those ofother studies showing that non-whites may have less access tomedical care or poorer outcomesthan white patients. \"It is dif cult to generalize from these ndings toother areas of health care,\" Rosen-heck said.\"The kinds of people whowork with the homeless are gener-ally those who have a special com-mitment to fairness and social jus-tice,so these results don'tnecessarily translate elsewhere.\"remember that you kept secrets in it.\" The service, Rizzolo said, allows students to express thefrustrations, angst and otheremotions that come with theexperience of exploring acadaver. \"It is really their rstexperience with a patient, eventhough the patient is dead,\" hesaid. \"It raises a lot of thoughtsabout their own mortality andtheir lives as clinicians.\" Each year, when the anato- my class ends, the bodies arecremated.

Angioplasty is an invasive procedure in which a balloonis inflated inside a blood ves-sel, most often a coronaryartery, to flatten any plaquethat blocks flow through thevessel. A metal device called astent is often inserted to helpkeep the artery open. It canrelieve chest pain, but there isno denite evidence to datethat it will lower the risk of afuture heart attack. Moreover,angioplasty itself poses risks ofinducing a heart attack orstroke, as well as hemorrhageand infection. Eric Holmboe, .., assistant professor of medicine, and his colleaguesinterviewed patients, ages to , on the eve of the proce- dure about their views of thepotential benets and risks.Patients risks,overestimate benets of elective angioplasty Public health experts decryhealth care conditions that re-sult in percent of the Amer- ican population not gettingroutine examinations, preven-tive inoculations and screen-ings. They often cite barriersto entry into the health caresystem, such as lower econom-ic status, language di culties and lack of education. A studyof physicians directed by a Yaleinvestigator came up with thesurprising result that doctorsseem even less likely than therest of the population to havea regular source of care ( ) such as a primary physician. Third of doctors don't practice what they preach Most patients believe that angio- plasty can prevent heart attacksand prolong their lives,but physi-cians need to do a better job ofinforming them of the risks andbenefits,according to a Yale study.

The history of the medical school itself begins with the opening of the Medical Institu-tion of Yale College in on Grove Street, more than a hundred years after the foundingof Yale College, and its robust early years thatwere due largely to the reputations of two of itsfour founding professors, Benjamin Sillimanand Nathan Smith. \"They were two absolutelyoutstanding individuals,\" says historian Bur-row, \"and at the time, there was no other med-ical school in Connecticut or even close by.\"The school flourished throughout the rst halfof the century. Around the s, however, it became harder to attract students. More schools had opened,increasing the competition. It was also a darkperiod for mainstream medicine, as the num-ber of unorthodox practitioners multiplied.\"There were a lot of charlatans\" trying to pass for doctors, Burrow says. \"Medicine didn'tseem to be going anywhere.\" To distinguishitself from the competition\u2014and distance itselffrom the quacks\u2014the medical school raised its standards. But enrollment suffered, as didthe school's nances. Rather than retreat, thefaculty members, all of whom were part-time,diverted their Yale salaries to the school andtook IOUs. \"That is what is remarkable aboutthe medical school, that people who were notgetting a great amount of money donated theirtime and effort,\" says Historical Librarian Toby A. ... , who curated the exhibit. \"It was like a mission for them. Theyreally wanted it to be good.\" The rst years of medicine at Yale, especially the th century, can be summed up as \"a strong start and a weak nish,\" says Burrow, adding that numerous efforts to raisestandards almost cost the school its existence at the start of the th century. But the best years were yet to come. \u2014 Pem McNerney Next: 1901 to 1951, a period of tremendous growth for the medical school. above The medical school flourished in its early years especially due to thereputations of Nathan Smith,right,professor of the theory and practice ofphysic and surgery,and Benjamin Silliman,left,professor of chemistry.Background: Lecture notes taken by a student of Smith during the 1819-20 academic year. opposite page Harry Burr Ferris, M.D. (1865-1940),third from left,an1887 graduate of Yale College and 1890 alumnus of the medical school,joined the faculty as an instructor inanatomy in 1891.

I have the virus.\" She went out of the room and she never came back. She never came back. When you're listening to a patient tell you things that you have to integrate into a whole body of knowledge you have, it's hard to listen well, because your mind is trying to filter out what they're saying.And consider alternate diagnoses and so forth. So you're really not listening; you're trying to solve the puzzle ... and so it just sort of goes by you that they said something very, very important. You didn't hear it.yale medicine spring 2001 23Listening with open ears Fundamental to listening well, says playwright Anna Deavere Smith, is \"to understand that what you'rehearing from a person is not something you've everheard before.\" For a doctor, that means listening toeach new patient \"every time, every time like it's thefirst time, because it's the first time for the patient,\"says Smith. The diagnosis may be familiar, even rou-tine, but the illness is unique to the patient. \"The doctor's job is not only to have the answers. Sometimes as patients we want doctors to hear thespectacular thing we just said as if they had neverheard it before, because they haven't. That would beone of the hardest things for a doctor to under-stand,\" says Smith. A professor at New York Universi-ty, Smith has made a career of listening to peopleunder pressure and using their words and ways ofspeaking to create documentary theater. Her Obie-winning piece Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities grew out of in-depth interviews with 50 people, of whom she portrayed26. Smith developed her presentation at Yale byinterviewing 21 people and incorporating excerptsfrom 11 of the interviews. \"The people I interviewed in Crown Heights, on the heels of a race riot, were really quite like thepatients I heard here. They had a certain urgency.They really wanted to be heard and felt they had notbeen. I have a particular interest in worlds that areupside down. When a person is ill, that's their lifeupside down,\" she says. Smith distinguishes between empathizing with a person and identifying with that person. \"It is themost precious moment to realize that the person sit-ting in front of me is not me . To listen or to have empathy means being able to remain present as awitness to something that is happening that isunusual to me\" as the listener, she says. A physician ...or anyone ... who connects deeply with others doesnot remain unaffected, however. \"None of us whoare doing our work well really can say that we justobserve what is happening around us and just moveon. The older we get, the more experienced we gethaving it affect us, using it as a resource in helpingus connect with others more and more. People cansee whether you have experienced suffering, experi-enced joy. The more they can see that in you, themore they can share their lives with you, the morethey can open up and feel they are giving their livesinto good hands.\" Faced with another person's pain, we can rise to the occasion and \"absorb it as part of a larger under-standing of who we all are and the predicament weare all in: that life is transient, and it is a gift.\" 22The physicians who crowded into Fitkin for medical grand rounds in mid-November had notcome to hear a colleague discussing a disease butrather to watch an outsider make a case for thepotential richness of doctor-patient communi-cation. Playwright and actress Anna DeavereSmith used the words of physicians and patientsfrom the Yale community to create Rounding It Out, a -minute examination of how doctors and patients view one another. The recipient of a MacArthur Foundation fellowship for creating a new genre of docu-mentary theater, Smith has appeared in lm andon television in The American President , The West Wing and The Practice but is best known for her solo stage performances depicting com-munities in turmoil. In Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities , Smith portrays two dozen real people, from citybureaucrats to housewives, to explore the clash between black and Jewish residents ofCrown Heights. In Twilight: Los Angeles , , she examines the riots sparked by the RodneyKing verdict. A less obvious crisis brought Smith to the medical school: the erosion of intimacybetween patient and physician. In Ralph I. Horwitz, .., chair of the Department of Internal Medicine, and Rastegar, the subject ofthe opening scene and the department's associ-ate chair for medical education, had been dis-cussing how to train novice doctors to listenbetter. When they heard Smith speak on campuson Martin Luther King Day in , \"it struck us that she is probably the best listener we hadever seen,\" Rastegar recalls. And so Smith cameto Yale last summer and fall to interview physicians, nurses, and patients and their fami-lies to create what she calls \"a rst draft,\" weav-ing together excerpts from the interviews withher own commentary and songs sung by LynetteDupre and Suzzy Roche. In Fitkin and againthe next day in Harkness Auditorium, Smithperformed for packed houses that included theve physicians and six patients whose wordsshe spoke from the stage. Noting that \"the inti-macy of transactions is dissolving\" in our socie-\"I have looked at every single patient as being a phenomenal new experience,\" says Smith,using Rastegar's words and his Farsi accent.\"Excited to walk in that room. Oh yeah, ohyeah, no question about it. Phenomenallyexcited. Every time, every time, every time.\" Moments later, Smith portrays another doctor, Forrester A. Lee Jr., .. ', ', a cardiologist and the school's assistant dean formulticultural a airs, who calmly and deliberately describes how medical training itself can blockvital avenues of communication. \"When you'relistening to a patient tell you things that youhave to integrate into a whole body of knowl-edge you have, it's hard to listen well, becauseyour mind is trying to lter out what they'resaying. And consider alternate diagnoses and soforth. So you're really not listening; you're try-ing to solve the puzzle ... and so it just sort ofgoes by you that they said something very, veryimportant. You didn't hear it.\" Sitting down in a chair, Smith becomes a patient, speaking with a trace of a Southernaccent. She is Frankie Harris, a woman with who has been treated at Yale. \"I didn't trust anyone. Doctors wasn't listen- ing. I had to ght, I had to advocate for myself to get doctors to listen to me. I had to learn tosay, 'What's the side e ects of this?' Learn to say 'No, I'm not takin' that, give it to someoneelse, let someone else try it rst.' ... I am veryconscious and very responsible for other peo-ple's health when it comes to my virus. And Isays [to the doctor] 'Look, before you examineme put some gloves on. I have the virus.' Shewent out of the room and she never came back.She never came back.\"The playwright and actress Anna Deavere Smith stands in the well of Fitkin Amphitheater musing about how patients and doctors manageto communicate under pressure when she slips on a white coat and transforms herself into Yale physician Asghar Rastegar, ..

That would have to be a kind of haiku. Are the doctors pre-pared for that? The patients?\" In her portrayal of Horwitz, Smith brings to life the physician's conflict between work andpersonal life. \"For a long time medicine tookthe view that if you perfected yourself as aphysician, you would have a full and completelife. That everything else would fall into place.That the perfect doctor would be the perfectperson. And there's nothing more arrogant.And nothing less true. ... You're hearing thisfrom a person that spends far too little time athome with my family.\" Smith's journey through the medical school and hospital took her again to Lee, as hedescribed the excruciating wait for a heart. \"Allthe kinds of encouraging and supporting thingsthe patient wants to hear from me largely centeraround 'When am I going to be transplanted?'And it's the one question I cannot answer. ...Most of my patients will tell you I am veryquiet, I don't have many words.\" He describestelling an African-American patient that heneeded a new heart. \"And he looked at me andsaid, 'They don't transplant black people,' andI looked at him and I said, 'You're kidding, doyou really believe that?' And he did. So it was avery, very joyous day in my life to walk into hisroom and say: 'We have a heart for you today.Believe it.' \" Smith portrayed Associate Dean Ruth Katz, ..., .., recalling her treatment for cancer. \"As much faith as you have in this place, everytime they give you chemotherapy ... I had afriend there with me to make sure the bag ofchemotherapy with that stu in there that theywere about to pump into me was exactly what I was supposed to get. No more. No less.\" In amoment of comic relief, Katz recalls the day anoncology fellow reported that Katz's chart hadbeen lost and that he had to take a new historyfrom the very beginning. He came to the ques-tion of her occupation and learned that Katzwas associate dean of the medical school. \"Nowhe looks up and he said, 'At thismedical school?' And I said, 'At the Yale School of Medicine.'He found my les within a half an hour.\" The last patient portrayed on the stage was Karina Danvers, a woman with : \"People think that just because you have a terminal ill-ness, or chronic or whatever they want to callit, all of a sudden every day is just precious andwonderful. I still beep my horn when some-body's at the red light for too long.\" She paus-es. \"I wish sometimes people would feel sorryfor me. Ya know? Because it's really tough liv-ing this ... I am a young woman ... dying.\" The presentation was \"an a rming reminder of how valuable and privileged our connectionswith patients are,\" said Stephen J. Huot, .., .., ', associate professor of medicine. \"It was wonderful to see humanity as part ofmedical grand rounds.\" First-year medical stu-dent Michael Shapiro said watching Smith por-tray Yale doctors made him ask himself againhow well he listens. \"Anna Deavere Smith inessence was holding a mirror up to the audi-ence and saying, 'Look at you, look at whatyou're doing.' \" Shapiro's classmate, Jenny Yiee, said that by inviting Smith to campus, the medicalschool administration had validated Yiee's beliefthat doctor-patient communication is vital.Some students, Yiee said, believe that under-standing science is more valuable than under-standing patients. They regard the requiredrst-year course known as \"The as a \"blah-blah-blah class,\" saying,\"Let's go study biochem now.\" Musician Roche, formerly of The Roches, said she felt elated after performing a scriptabout medicine for an audience of physicians.patientAs much faith as you have in this place, every time they give you chemotherapy. ...

Horwitz hopes to nd money to bring Smith back to campusperiodically, to continue the discussion begunlast fall. Smith has not decided whether she will develop Rounding It Out into a full-fledged the- atrical production. That depends in part onnding a grant to support the project. Shedescribes the work as, \"at best, an o ering. I wanted it to be a provocation and a cause forconversation.\" Rastegar said Smith's visit has,indeed, made \"a di erent kind of dialogue totally acceptable, a discussion of the patient'snarrative and their view of their illness.\" The experience of having her story told in a public forum was fullling for patientFrankie Harris, whose painful account of beingpimped by her mother made some people in the audience cry. \"There was a time I felt that I was always alone, and there was a time that I felt that I deserved all that happened to me. It was healing to let go of the blame and let goof the shame.\"\"It's what theater could really be. Instead of big stars and People magazine, it could be relevant to people's lives in their own community.\" For third-year resident Christopher Ruser, .., Rounding It Out served as an antidote to the eects of residency. \"I think residency has a tendency to depersonalize patients because ofpressures, time limitations, fatigue. WatchingSmith reminds us why we chose this career. ...We are privileged to be able to sit in a roomand hear everything, to nd out what their ill-ness means to them as a complete person.\" Seeing the senior physicians depicted by Smithgave him hope that as he becomes more adeptat reaching diagnoses, he will increasingly ndways to use the patient interview to becomeacquainted with the whole person. Because ofthe performance, Ruser said, \"I would go inand really try to understand the person whowas in that bed, and not just what I had to dofor the patient in the next hours.\" Smith said in an interview that she'd come to understand that \"the diagnostic procedurewith a patient could by necessity\u2014particularlyfor a younger doctor\u2014require that they notsee the whole person.\" She hoped her workwould help doctors \"reflect on how, over time,to allow the whole person and the person who'sbeing inspected [by the physician] to both live.\" Establishing that kind of connection with a patient is essential to good care, according toRastegar. \"People recognize quickly if you seethem as a whole human being or are just treat-ing them as a disease. Despite all the wonderfultherapeutic modalities we have developed,there are many diseases we cannot cure. So ourrole is helping them adjust to the illness and goon with their life. You need to know the wholeperson to do that. It's in a marriage betweenscientic understanding and understanding ofthe human being in his or her totality that wecan provide the best care.\" Smith's presentation and her discussions with students and house sta were part of what Horwitz describes as \"a larger e ort to refocus attention on the medical profession's civic doctorTick tock tick tock. Which was going to come first, his death or a donor organ? [The wait] is absolutely the most diffcult part of the job, absolutely the most diffcult part. If I had to face every patient on the waitinglist and talk to them about their waiting I could not do this. The stresses that are put on the physicians and nurses and other caregivers are absolutely phenomenal. ... Patients want the answer today or want thesolution today. ... But I have no control over when an organ is going to be available.29 28 WednesdayLearning for the long run For a quarter-century the Wednesday Evening Clinic has offered steady care to patients and an unequaled lesson in medicine to Yale students.Story and photographs by John Curtis At the Wednesday Evening Clinic, medical students provide the first lineof care, taking histories and exam-ining patients before presenting theircases to the attending physicians inthe clinic. Here, Sarah Nikiforow goesover the details of a case and her proposed treatment plan with MorrisDillard, right, one of the clinic'sfounders and, until five years ago,its director.Kathleen White, .., likes to tell the story of the clinic patient who worried that her doctor was not there to care for her. Although surrounded by people inwhite coats with stethoscopes dangling from their necks, none of them was the person who knew and understood her medical history and with whom she yale medicine spring 2001 31had established a bond. They were doctors, but they were not her doctor. Her doctor was a med-ical student, working under the supervision ofattending physicians. And the patient had beenreceiving her primary care at the WednesdayEvening Clinic. Since the mid- s, the clinic has provided care to the New Haven community while givingstudents a chance to practice \"longitudinal,\" orlong-term, medicine and learn how to connectwith their patients. \"This is the only place inmed school,\" said Fran Balamuth, the clinic'sstudent director, \"where you get to see the samepatient again and again.\" This is no small thing. Typically medical students spend no more than four weeks on eachof their clinical clerkships. That time is oftenspent watching residents work, with an occa-sional chance to practice hands-on medical careunder supervision. Some schools o er longitu- dinal preceptorships in the rst two years ofmedical school, and some student-run clinicsprovide opportunities to assist in emergency careor serve as patient advocates. The University ofConnecticut places rst-year medical studentswith practicing clinicians, a match that contin-ues through the third year of medical school,White said. But in general, at Yale and aroundthe country, medical students have few oppor-tunities to follow patients over time. At the Wednesday Evening Clinic, the stu- dents are the rst to see patients, the rst to takehistories and the rst to conduct physical exami-nations. \"The whole idea of longitudinal carestruck me as being an awfully important one,\"said John E. Whitcomb, .. ', one of the clinic's earliest student participants, who nowpractices emergency medicine in Milwaukee. \"I wanted to have a relationship with people.\" Added Lynn E. Sullivan, .. ', ', who spent months in the clinic when she took time o from medical school to have her second child, \"It isn't the fleeting kind of expe-rience you have on your clerkships. My patientswould ask for me by name and only want to see me.\" Sullivan, now an assistant clinical professorof medicine, is also one of the clinic's attendings. A year ago the clinic's student practitioners honored the man they credit not only withfounding the clinic a quarter-century ago, butwith keeping it going and making it a warmand welcoming place to learn medicine. Theyheld the rst lecture in recognition of G. MorrisDillard, .., .., who served as the clinic's director until ve years ago. Howard K. Koh, .. ', ..., now Commissioner of Public Health for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,was the rst speaker at the Morris DillardHonorary Lecture, in January . \"On rare occasions, one has the incredible fortune togain a mentor who changes your life,\" Koh saidof Dillard. \"Dr. Dillard believed in us and inour full potential. He encouraged us to becomedoctors in our own way. When he adopted youas a student, he would stand by you forever.\" Dillard has counseled students, nurtured them and bucked up their flagging spirits. EachThanksgiving he cooks one of his legendarygourmet dinners for the clinic. \"He has made ita very warm, friendly and cohesive group ofpeople,\" said White, who succeeded Dillard asthe clinic's medical director ve years ago. \"Heis the heart and soul of the clinic,\" said WendyGarrett, who is in her seventh year of the ../.. Program and until recently served as the clinic's student director. The clinic started in the mid- s, when students asked the medical school administra-tion for a longitudinal primary-care experi-ence. The administration declined, but invitedstudents to organize their own program.\"They gave the students the responsibility forforming the clinic, running the clinic andobtaining the appropriate support from thefaculty,\" recalled Dillard. Students found spaceThis is the only place in med school where you get to see the same patient again and again. \u2014 Fran Balamuth, student director of the Wednesday Evening Clinic John Curtis is the associate editor of Yale Medicine . 30 In the conference room that serves as meeting place, dining room, lounge,office and consulting room for theWednesday Evening Clinic, directorKathleen White and student directorFran Balamuth discuss of theevening's cases. \"Don't stop exercising,\" Sarah Niki- forow tells her Mary Jacob,who's in a Nikiforow, whomonitors Jacob's cerebral palsy, testsher patient's arm strength.yale medicine spring 2001 33 32in the Primary Care Center, which was closed evenings, and enlisted the support of physi-cians, nurses and support sta willing to vol- unteer their time. \"At rst it was very di cult to get patients,\" said Dillard. \"But we were theonly clinic open at night in the hospital. Wewere the rst clinic to have an on-call physi-cian. We could be contacted hours a day, seven days a week, every day of the year.\" Then, as now, patient population came largely through the Primary Care Center, theemergency department and self-referrals.Although it had the virtue of being open atnight, the clinic also acquired a stigma it hassince overcome. \"The students endured thediscrimination of being a student clinic,despite the presence of attendings,\" said Dil-lard, who, along with clinic director White,leads a rotating cadre of faculty and communi-ty physicians who supervise the students. A white-haired, bespectacled doctor who listens quietly as students present cases, Dillardseems, the students say, to know everythingabout everything. And he also appears to knowthings without being told. \"I was having a badnight,\" recalled Nir Modiano, a fth-year student in the ../.. Program. It was half an hour past closing time and patients werestill waiting to be seen. \"Without knowingwhat was going on he came up to me, put bothhis hands on my shoulders and stood there fora few seconds. I don't think he said a word.Then he turned around and walked away, and I felt better.\" The clinic's caregivers get to know each other over dinner every Wednesday. They take turnsproviding the evening meal, often a stack of piz-zas on the conference room table. As they eat,students and faculty discuss clinic business, suchas a plan to obtain free samples for their patientsfrom pharmaceutical companies. They mayreview an unusual case\u2014one night it was a patient from the Sudan with a calcied wormunder her skin. Often the group breaks up intotwo or three smaller sessions for case reviews withan attending. By p.m. the students are ready for the two to four patients each of them will see. \"We do a thorough history,\" said Modiano. \"We do a physical exam and formulate ourown thoughts, then present the patient to theattending.\" The student returns to the exami-nation room with the attending, who mayobtain more history or conduct another physi-cal exam. \"The student may have already comeup with a plan of treatment,\" said White, \"andthe attending will verify specic exam ndingsand conrm the plan or alter or add to it.\" Some nights, when attendings are in short supply, the students wait their turn for a con-sult. Some students huddle with attendings ina corner or the doorway as others squeeze intothe conference room to look for patient chartsor grab a slice of pizza. Their cases run thegamut\u2014a -year-old woman with a lung obstruction, a patient with diabetes, a womansuering from osteoporosis, a patient with chest pain, a refugee from Sierra Leone withpost-traumatic stress disorder. One evening Sarah Nikiforow's patient was Mary Jacob, a -year-old with cerebral palsy. With ve years at the clinic (she's in her eighthyear of the ../.. Program), Nikiforow is the clinic veteran. Jacob, who has arthritis andoccasional muscle spasms, has been her patientfor years. \"Don't stop exercising,\" Nikiforowtold her, after a physical exam. \"That's what'skeeping you in such good shape.\" Ongoing relationships with patients are but one of the benets of the clinic for students. far left In one of the examination rooms, Nir Modiano interviews a new patient. middle Every Wednesday, after din- ner and before the clinic opens, thestudents break up into small groupsled by an attending for a case review.Dillard meets with students Leo Kim,Wendy Garrett and Dita Gratzinger. left With space scarce, Jackie William uses the counter at a nurses' station tofill out a patient's chart. Another is the chance to work with a network of physicians they will see repeatedly over thecourse of a year or longer. During their time atthe clinic the students observe a variety ofstyles, including Dillard's. \"He steps back anddoes nothing at times and the students takeover and make a decision,\" said clinic directorWhite. \"He has made it a very academicallychallenging place.\" Such longitudinal clinics,White said, provide an obvious benet to med-ical students. \"You watch them start as clumsyducklings and then blossom into competentand caring clinicians.\" The clinic blends elements of the real world and an idealized vision of medicine. With theirlimited case loads and no need to make a livingfrom clinical practice, students have the luxuryof time denied many physicians. They are oncall and often accompany their patients toother medical appointments or the hospital.\"It's a great opportunity for the patients,\" saidShelly Harrigan, .., who's worked at the clinic for three years. \"The students do excel-lent follow-up.\" \"Patients who have medical students help- ing to take care of them are some of the best-cared-for patients,\" said Sullivan. \"The stu-dents are just aching to see patients and startbeing doctors. This is a way in which they cando it in a very organized, safe and nurturingenvironment.\" Dorothy Mosley, a patient at the clinic since , has never thought twice about being seen by medical students. \"I had all good ones,\" shesaid. \"I knew if I had a problem I could callsomeone. They are helping me through my cri-sis right now. When my husband passed awayin May, Dr. Dillard was right there for me.Wendy Garrett was right there for me.\" The students themselves, White said, have asked for some changes in the program. Theywant more constructive criticism from the attendings and more detailed instruction ingiving a physical examination. \"The nature ofthe clinic is that we attempt to give feedback atthe time, as di cult as it is,\" White said, adding that Herbert S. Chase Jr., .., deputy dean for education, is planning an evaluationof the clinic's value as a teaching tool. A year in the clinic replaces a month-long primary-care clerkship, making it very attrac-tive to students in the ../.. Program, who have lled most of the student sta positions for the past three years. The clinic letsthem advance their clinical skills while theywork on their research projects and it providesa welcome break from days in the lab. Studentsin the clinic are trying to broaden their out-reach and recruit more students outside the ../.. Program. By p.m. the students are seeing their last patients of the evening. Long after patientshave left, the students will stay on, writing uptheir notes from the evening's cases. Few leavebefore p.m. and some stay until midnight, lling out charts. \"There is no doubt in mymind that the care our patients receive is sur-passed by no other clinic,\" said Dillard. \"Theoriginal clinic was designed by students tomeet one time a week throughout the entireyear, to be responsible for patients every daythroughout the year. In return, the studentsreceive an educational experience equal to theclinical responsibility.\"Students in the Wednesday Evening Clinic are assembling a registry of the clinic's alumni. Alumni are encour-aged to send their address, phonenumber, e-mail address and a briefnote describing their current activitiesto kathleen.white@yale.edu.The whole idea of longitu- dinal care struck me as being an awfully important one.I wanted to have a relationshipwith people. \u2014 John Whitcomb, one of the clinic's earliest studentparticipants, now an emer-gency physician in Milwaukee.35 34Story and photographs by Sharon Anoush ChekijianLetter from Armenia above A woman walks past the 13th- century Katoghike, right, the oldestsurviving church in Yerevan, Armenia'scapital.

This might seem late to a doctor from New Haven, where residents and students \"pre-round\" at :a.m. in preparation for the daily ritual two hours later. But here in Yerevan thesurgeons virtually live at the hospital and thereis little need to catch up each morning. Rounds are conducted in Russian, the lin- gua franca of professional and intellectual lifein this former Soviet state, and consist mostlyof a seated discussion in a smoky room. There isno operative schedule as such, no operating-room start time. The operating room is reservedon a rst-come, rst-served basis by alerting thenurse in charge that there will be a patient arriv-ing shortly, after which begins the process ofnegotiating for sta to assist in the surgery. Emergencies are numerous and take priority, butthe hospital has no emergency room. Patients areevaluated in the driveway, the hall or the doctors'oces depending on the severity of their illness. On this hot, dry morning, Gevork Yaghjyan, .., .., and I are back in his oce by :, the time when patients and doc- tors begin to le in for the day's consultations.The door opens without a knock: here?\"An professor, Gevork is the youngest faculty member at Yerevan State Medical Univer-sity, and at the age of he has already earned his patronym, a sign of respect.

There iscall whenever you are lucky to be on the sched-ule. And if you are one of the only specialists inthe country, call is every day. Doctors here askfor extra duty. It is their only true source ofincome, not counting the o cial pay of about $a month. How many of us would enter a profession with numbers like that? In addition to what they earn from the hos- pital, the surgeons receive fees from their grate-ful patients. What they are paid depends on themeans of the patient's family.

The worried studentsstepped out onto the road to be searched. Arturrecognized the scarred hand of one of the sol-diers from a photo he had seen in a lecture inYerevan. \"Was Gevork your surgeon?\" Arturasked, thinking quickly. The soldier said, \"No,Gevork was not my surgeon.\" He paused andlooked at Artur, sizing him up, then wrappedhis huge arms around the student in a bearhug. \"Gevork,\" he declared, \"is my brother.\"With that, Artur and his fellow travelers weresent on their way. Our scrupulous avoidance of treating one's own family or friend is unthinkable in a coun-try where all business is conducted on the basisof personal contacts and many patients anddoctors become friends for life. Gevork is wellknown in Nagorno-Karabakh. During the peak of the ghting in the early s, he made dozens of trips by helicopter to perform reconstructive surgery. The rst time Gevorkinvited me to the hospital in Yerevan, it was to help him change the bandages of a soldierfrom Nagorno-Karabakh who had been flownto the capital after a land-mine explosion. Each day in First Hospital brings new surgi- cal challenges. One day, a girl from a regionnear ex-Soviet Georgia was brought in. Localdoctors had treated her after a bad car accident,but her leg became so infected that the skinhad to be removed from the knee to the ankle.We treated her with antibiotics and then skinwas grafted from both hips to cover the defect.There was the patient with a gunshot wound tothe buttocks that had severed the sciatic nerve.Another gunshot victim arrived with the thirdand fourth metacarpal bones of the hand frac-tured beyond recognition. There was a younggirl with a facial nerve severed by a small injurywho looked ne until she smiled and her facetook on a twisted shape. For the longest time Iforgot about what we commonly think a plasticsurgeon does. In the middle of the relative chaosof First Hospital, there are the rare few who seekcosmetic surgery, breast augmentation, rhino-plasty or facelifts. These seem frivolous in a placewhere every induction of anesthesia and everyoperation bear an unbelievable risk compared tothose done in the vastly more controlled settingsof the operating rooms back home. Gevork knows that world as well. Early last year, he came to Yale to study the physiology ofsurgical flaps with J. Grant Thomson, .., an associate professor in the section of plastic andfrom a patient unable to pay in cash. It falls to Gevork as surgeon to make sure that the anes-thesiologist, nurses and others who assistedreceive fair compensation\u2014a matter that canbecome quite complicated when the currency islivestock. Remuneration comes in other forms,too. In outlying country hospitals, the pay mightbe a home-cooked meal followed by toasts ofvodka brought to the hospital by the family tocelebrate a successful operation. It was di cult for me to imagine American surgeons sittingdown to a meal with the patient's family. Theylaughed when the doctors told them that I was not used to such close relations betweenpatient and doctor. The personal touch in Armenian medicine is apparent in other ways as well. Apartmentbuildings usually have a doctor living there. Sothat even when doctors are home, for all intentsand purposes they are on call. Any emergency istheir responsibility\u2014not a legal or an adminis-trative responsibility but an ethical and humanone that everyone takes for granted. Once a medical student named Artur was traveling in the mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh, six hours away from Yerevan.Nagorno-Karabakh is an historically Armenianland and a focus of Armenian art and culture.Under the Soviets, Stalin redrew maps of the region and included Nagorno-Karabakh inthe Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan. Fightingbroke out there in , shortly after the region asked to be annexed to the Soviet Republic of Armenia, and the conflict intensied in when Nagorno-Karabakh asked to become an independent state, as had Armenia andAzerbaijan. A cease-re has been in effect since1994, with Nagorno-Karabakh now function-ing as an independent republic. top photo Young brothers pose for a photograph in the kitchen of theirhome in Yerevan. above Children in the village of Gogaran take a break from their play.It was difficult for me to imagine American surgeons sitting down to a meal with the patient's family.They laughed when the doctorstold them that I was not used tosuch close rela tions between patient and doctor.yale medicine spring 2001 41 40for sponsors in the United States. A grade- school friend of my grandfather, long settled inBoston's Armenian community, had seen hisname and photograph in a church publication,and o ered to sponsor his relocation to Ameri- ca. In October of , my family set sail from Beirut on the SS Corinthia, bound for theUnited States. They arrived on Christmas Eve. My father was when the family arrived in Massachusetts. After high school, he went toBoston University, then served in the Army. AtFort Bragg in North Carolina, he met my moth-er, and they married and moved to Phoenix afterhe left the service so that he could attend gradu-ate school. They returned to Boston in , where he pursued his career in the hotel industryand where I grew up. My curiosity about Armenia grew while I was in college. I wanted to explore a land I hadheard described in mythic terms throughoutmy childhood. After my junior year in Francein , I applied to the University of Michigan Summer Language Institute in Yerevan and leftthe labyrinth-like streets of Paris for the unpavedmountain roads of a truly foreign country. WhenI arrived, many French, American and Armen-ian-born doctors were still providing earthquakerelief. Almost four years later, determined tobecome a doctor, I attended the ArmenianMedical Congress in Boston as part of a plan tovisit Armenia in July . I had graduated from Smith in and worked in the pubic health eld in New York City for several years, onprojects designed to improve prenatal care andboost immunization rates. The Congress served as a crash course in the current status of health care. Armenians fromall over the world had come to listen to then-Minister of Health Ara Babloyan, .., and see how they might help for tify the country's health care system. I phoned a friend, Alain Hovnanian, .., a physician in Paris, to tell him about my trip and to ask how I might behelpful to him while in Armenia. There was anotable pause and a sigh of relief. He had justreceived a letter from a woman named Assia,whom he had met in the village of Gogaran,where he had helped in the reconstruction ofan th-century church. Assia was on chronic dialysis and, given the state of the hospitals andpharmacies, was unable to buy necessities suchas stulas, lters and tubing. Although kidneydisease is a serious health problem in Armenia,as it is in the United States, organ transplanta-tion has not yet been established as a wide-spread therapy. Alain asked if I would be ableto transport supplies to Assia and communicatehis concern. I did so, and four years after I had rst met Alain in Paris, I found myself on aback road in the village of Gogaran looking forAssia's house, which I had been told lay some-where past the beekeeper's house but before thepotato elds. It was during this trip in that I met Gevork. I asked him if I could observe in theoperating room. There I witnessed my rst oper-ation, the setting of a woman's broken femur. Tomy surprise, I loved surgery. I watched as a car-diac surgeon from Oregon augmented the ven-tricle of a -year-old girl. Hrair Hovagumian, .., had come to Armenia for a month to instruct other surgeons and ended up taking anindenite leave of absence from his universitypost. He remained in Armenia, where he is nowperforming three open-heart surgeries a day andwas grinning widely when I last saw him. Since arriving at Yale as a rst-year medical student in , I have had ve more opportu- nities to return to Armenia. Each trip has beena chance to reformulate plans, to re-evaluatedecisions and to reflect. These trips have been abreak from the ordinary and a chance to under-stand how truly fortunate we are. For me, travelhas served as both a bu er and a catalyst between periods of contemplation and intervening peri-ods of hard work. I began my thesis, Legal, Pro- fessional, Public and Policy Barriers to the Develop-ment of Organ Donation and Transplantation inthe Republic of Armenia , in in cooperation with the Armenian Ministry of Health. My initial contact with the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the Uni-versity Teaching Hospital in Yerevan in led to repeated visits over the last six years and aneducation in reconstructive surgery that hascontinued despite the distance. Gevork and hiscolleagues have shared their work with melong-distance, e-mailing images of their mostinteresting cases. I have spent long hours withGevork and the other surgeons, traveling by roadto the military hospital in Nagorno-Karabakh.We have visited every hospital in the Republic ofArmenia, checking on the progress of flaps creat-ed earlier in the day. The patients I have seen in Armenia have provided the most vivid reminders of why wepractice medicine. One was a young boy whoseforehead was burned so badly by an electricshock that there was no flesh to cover his skull.Another was a little boy holding his severednger in a dirty dishtowel. There was a boywhose nose was all but removed by the bite of adog, a young woman whose breast was recon-structed after a mastectomy, and a woman whoselips and nose were eaten away by a basal cell car- cinoma, neglected for years due to lack of money. Despite limited resources, Gevork has been able to form a small laboratory in Yerevanwhere he is investigating the factors that allowhis patients to heal. All the reagents in the labare painstakingly prepared from scratch by thestudents and residents. He purchases rats him-self from a man who breeds them for medicalresearch. In New Haven I don't think Gevorkever got used to ordering rats from a catalog orseeing animals treated better than most of hispatients in Yerevan. The true mark of luxury tohim was that a veterinarian would be calledshould a lab rat fall ill. Indeed, Gevork's experi-ence at Yale has been a far cry from his life athome. He is constantly amazed by the organi-zation of things, by the operative schedule, bythe way an instrument magically appears whena surgeon calls for it, by the orderly progress ofclinic and follow-up visits, by the labs and byour easy ability to sequence , make radio- active tags for molecules and measure ischemia.He is amazed but I also think he feels the sameway that I do, that we give up something inreturn. There is a bond with patients in Arme-nia, a sense of urgency and vitality that oftenseems to be missing here. A knock on the door brings a new patient eagerly peering past the crowd of residents andpatients that routinely ll Gevork's o ce and spill out into the hall. I hear the familiar\"Gevork Vigenovitch, ais deh a? \" and wonder what the day will bring.reconstructive surgery. Gevork, back in Armenia since last May, will return to Yale later this year asa Plastic Surgery Education Foundation fellow. Yale's involvement in Armenia has been steady since the earthquake in . Stafrom the Erebuni Hospital have been training at Yale.One of Armenia's recent ministers of health,Gagik Stamboltsyan, trained at Yale beforeassuming his new position. Under the directionof then-Chief of Plastic Surgery Stephan Ariyan, .., the Yale Center for Plastic and Recon- structive Surgery was built at the Erebuni Hos-pital in Yerevan to accommodate the increasedneed for reconstructive surgery during theclashes in Nagorno-Karabakh. Several operatingrooms were completed and Armenia was alsochosen as one of four sites for the Yale/ telemedicine project that links doctors aroundthe world in a network meant for teaching andconsultation. More recently, Artoum Sedrakian, .., a young cardiac surgeon from Yerevan, came to New Haven as a Fulbright scholar toconduct clinical outcomes research with cardi-ologist Harlan M. Krumholz, .. My father was born in Jerusalem to Armenian parents. My grandmother and grandfathercame from the Armenian cities of Marash andZeytoon, in what is today eastern T urkey, andfled as children in the wake of the massacres of Armenians in . My grandmother was orphaned as a result of the massacres and wassent to an orphanage for Armenian children in Lebanon. She grew up in the orphanage andbecame one of their best students. There, shebecame a teacher. At a teachers' conference inLebanon she met her future sister-in-law, whohastily arranged for her to marry my grand-father. My grandfather lived at that time in Allepo, S yria. They married in . Their rst child, my aunt Hermine, was born in . That same year, my grandfather went to Jerusalem in search of a better life forhis growing family. Jerusalem boasted a largeArmenian community until the late s, and part of our family was already living and work-ing there. My grandmother and aunt followedhim in . My grandfather made shoes and, in time, came to run his own factory, employ-ing over men. He lost everything during the Arab-Israeli War, when Jerusalem was parti-tioned and his family was sequestered in theArmenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.He could no longer travel throughout the Middle East as he had done, taking orders forhis products. Many families began looking Our scrupulous avoidance of treating one's own family or friend is unthinkable in a country where all business is conducted onthe basis of personal contacts and many patients and doctorsbecome friends for life.

Harkness Hall has brought new plumbing, heating and electri-cal wiring to the aging dormitory as well as such amenities as high-speed Internet access andlounges with modern kitchenettes. The renova-tions are the -story building's rst major over- haul since its construction in as a residence for students in the health professions. The improvements complete a process that began in , when the School of Medicine took over management of medical school hous-ing and dining services from the UniversityGraduate Housing Ofce and the Yale Univer-sity Dining Services. Changes to the building'saging infrastructure\u2014plumbing was built withWorld War II scrap metal that became brit-tle\u2014include not only repairs, but a new con-duit for telephone lines, cable television andcomputer cables. Also, dormitory rooms on thethird floor gave way to space for an expandedofce of education, as well as other ofces deal-ing with student issues, such as studentresearch, the .. /.. Program, internation- al health and multicultural affairs. The renova-tions provided a single destination for studentsfor handling their educational and supportneeds. \"The building was worn out,\" said EricSchonewald, associate director of resident life at the medical school. \"Technology had accel-erated to the point where we needed toupgrade, and the old housing was a turnoff toprospective students.\" Work started in the mid- s with the construction of Marigolds, a new cafeteria anddining area that opened in with a broader choice of meals and expanded hours. A faceliftof the building's exterior followed, includingthe replacement of more than windows and frames, and starting in June , floor- by-floor renovations brought the building into compliance with modern re, safety and handicapped-access codes. \"As floors were completed we moved the students up one level and leapfrogged up through the build-ing,\" Schonewald said, adding that the School of Medicine's Ofce of Project Manage-ment and Construction oversaw the work.\"They had to plan a renovation around anoccupied building.\" \"That was the greatest challenge: People were living in the building,\" said PeggyRubens-Duhl, project architect with SvigalsAssociates, the rm that designed the renovatedspace. The architects consulted with studentsto design more efcient rooms with more conveniently placed electrical and data outletsand new wardrobes and sinks that took up less space. Doorways were recessed to give eachroom the appearance of a private entrance.\"We know that the students are working in medical facilities, which tend to be sterile, so we wanted it to be like a home,\" saidRubens-Duhl. T wo rooms on alternating floors were sacri- ced to create new lounges, the building's rstcommon spaces on the residential floors. Fourof the eight residential floors have kitchenettesbuilt off of the lounge areas, two floors havelounges with televisions and two floors havequiet study areas. Rooms, each averaging about feet by feet, are equipped with a sink, a closet, a chestof drawers, a single bed and a desk. The dormitory keeps about of its rooms available for visitors, such as medicalschool applicants. Although a number ofrooms were kept vacant during renovations,Schonewald expects the building to be full inthe next academic year. \"We have created a liv-ing space that is competitive with any dormito-ry at Yale, and we are offering a product thatwelcomes our rst-year students,\" saidSchonewald. \u2014 John CurtisHarkness renovations heralded High-speed Internet access, other amenities bring aging dormitoryup to snuff.The eighth annual Hunger and Homelessness Auction achieved a number of rsts in November as it raised more than $ ,for New Haven charities.

In honor of his contributions to the medical school, two rooms were dedicated in Spinelli'shonor on Nov. , one at the / Neuro- science Research Center at the VA ConnecticutHealthcare System in West Haven and the oth-er at the medical school. In his remarks to faculty, students, alumni and his sister Viola Spinelli, who holds an ... degree from Yale, Spinelli said the school's mis-sion was to have \"bright, brilliant students ad-mitted and matched with bright, brilliantteachers. So I opted to support aid to the dean.\" When Spinelli entered Yale College in , times were lean. His father had lost his con-tracting business during the Great Depressionand later opened a gas station on the BostonPost Road. As a freshman Spinelli waited ontables in the college dining room. As a sopho-more he worked in a biology laboratory, wherehe found a mentor in Edgar J. Boell, a biologyprofessor. \"He was determined that I was goingto medical school and that I should go to Yale,\"Spinelli recalled.

Box 7612, New Haven, CT06519-0612.Drop in on medical grand rounds or morning report and you're likely to encounter Samuel Kushlan, 89, an enduring represen-tative of the Class of 1935 . Before the advent of antibiotics, chemotherapy, open heart surgery, dialysis or e ective treat- ments for diseases that are easily cured today,Samuel D. Kushlan, .. ', was ready to follow in the footsteps of the family doctor in NewBritain who had inspired him, a man known forhis compassion and respect for patients. Almost seven decades later, Kushlan, who has dedicated his life to Yale and New Haven,was awarded the medical school's highest honor,the Peter Parker Medal. Kushlan, who celebrat-ed his th birthday on Feb. , has never retired from medicine. His desire to help stu-dents and his curiosity about science make hima familiar gure on campus and particularly inthe Department of Internal Medicine, where heattends grand rounds every Thursday and morn-ing medical report nearly every day. \"It's like having a mystery story every morn- ing. It's extremely interesting,\" he said. \"Myfunction, as I see it, is to toss in a pearl from timeto time to pay my way.\" As an undergraduate at Yale College, where he was one of the top scholars in the Class of and a member of the basketball team,Kushlan persuaded then-Dean Milton C. Win- ternitz, .., to admit him to the medical school at age . When he graduated three years later, he remembers, \"we thought [medicine] was veryadvanced, but as you look back it was very prim-itive. It was really very simple\u2014there was noth-ing you could do for strokes or heart attacks.\" Only four medicines\u2014aspirin, digitalis, phenobarbital and quinine\u2014were commonlyused to treat illnesses. And as polio patientsflooded the hospital each summer, Kushlan andthe house sta hoped that \"prayer and good luck\" would help them escape the contagion. A Connecticut native, Kushlan ventured only once from his alma mater, going in to Harvard University and Massachusetts GeneralHospital, where he worked under Paul D.White, .., a cardiologist to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. \"After a short while, Idecided the grass was not greener there andwhen I came back I was content,\" he said. From World War II until the late s, Kushlan practiced internal medicine and gas-troenterology in New Haven and taught as amember of the clinical faculty. He served from until as associate physician-in-chief at Yale-New Haven Hospital and also as clinicalprofessor of medicine. After retiring from thelatter post in , he reviewed cases at Yale's medical and legal o ce for the next ve years. An active member of the alumni associationsince , its bequest and endowment ofcer and a resident of New Haven, \"My life is reallycentered around Yale,\" Kushlan said. The Peter Parker Medal, which Kushlan calls the capstone of his medical career, is named fora th century medical missionary to China edu- cated at Yale's medical and divinity schools. Themedal is not the rst recognition Kushlan hasreceived at Yale. The Samuel D. Kushlan Lec-tureship, established years ago, brings some of the best and brightest names in the eld of gas-troenterology to campus annually. And about a decade ago, the Department of Internal Medicine named one of its hospitalmedical services after him, putting him in thesame league as Allan Goodyer, Elisha Atkins,John Punnett Peters and Gerald Klatskin. \"Theother services were named after world-classphysicians and I'm a local-class physician.
