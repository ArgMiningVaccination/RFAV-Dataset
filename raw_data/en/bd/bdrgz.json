I've been in clinical practice for over 40 years. We treat both adults and children using natural therapies such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, medical massage, physiotherapies, nutrition, and homeopathy. The range of conditions we treat is extensive and includes most chronic and acute illnesses, e.g., musculo-skeletal injuries, pain syndromes, women's health issues, digestive disorders, allergies, asthma, headaches, insomnia, depression, anxiety, skin conditions, and stress. We do not only treat illnesses, we specialize in preventative and anti-aging programs. Many of our clients who initially come for treatment of specific conditions return for acupuncture/bodywork tune-up sessions and elect to continue with herbal/nutritional therapies. Our integrative philosophy provides a comprehensive and resourceful approach to address your specific healthcare needs. I welcome questions pertaining to specific conditions. I am available for phone consultations to address your questions and concerns. Consultations and treatments are available by appointment. We have flexible hours, including weekends, to accommodate your schedule. Please view the above video of my interview in my herbal pharmacy to learn more about my practice and how I can help you. My article \" [Roots and Needles, Healing in China Today](/article-roots),\" recounts my training in Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine in Chengdu, Sichuan Province and is a good introduction to my development as a healer. Additional publications and more information about me can be found on the About Page. I look forward to sharing them with you. "}
