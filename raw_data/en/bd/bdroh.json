The brand stands tall from a 120-year promise-kept to its community, cows and employees, but it needed a website overhaul to help it scale that promise to a wider, younger audience. Our challenge was to reflect Crystal's intent to pioneer the dairy industry with cleaner ingredients and sustainable operations without compromising the deep roots of nostalgia grown through more than a century in business. Brand & digital strategy Copywriting Design Photography & video Development Recipe development CMS SEO Brand evolution, led by digital Crystal is a timeless brand that hangs its hat on the old ways while its eyes fix on the future. For this project, we developed a natural retro-modern visual story that served as a fundamental transformation from the previous website, and actually increased the emotional connection back to 1901. Thoughtful design and storytelling can do that. \"Collaborative, creative, thought-provoking and adaptable \u2014 all terms I would readily use to describe our ongoing partnership with Active Ingredients.\" Brian Carden, VP Senior Director of Sales, Crystal Creamery 47% increase in visit duration 24% increase in pages per session Modern website design & development In addition to creating a visually-captivating and appetite-generating experience, we upgraded the site to meet the latest standards for responsive design and ADA accessibility compliance, with a fully custom content management system powering it on the back end. Stories told through photography, recipes, video and copy Ironically, we know that a website project is finally complete when it feels like a new beginning. In this case, it's a medium for connecting with Crystal's community through beautiful photography (with serious vibe), easy & delicious recipes (with serious flavor), and SEO-rich lifestyle tips (that offer serious inspiration).
