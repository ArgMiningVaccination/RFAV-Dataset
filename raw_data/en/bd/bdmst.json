It causes \"what look like holes in different little areas [of the brain]\". So explained a well-intentioned physician describing a graphically manipulated and misleading 3D brain scan of anEcstasy user, as shown by Oprah Winfrey to her millions of viewers on September 28, 2001. \"It's like living with an Alzheimer's patient.\" So lamented a mother to Oprah about her Ecstasy-using seventeen-year-old son's memory problems. In Illinois, simple possession of 15 doses will now get you a mandatory minimum four years with no parole. In the future that MAPS is working hard to create, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will become a regulated treatment for despair, not its cause. Fear, grief, guilt, sadness and despair are all emotions that can, in some circumstances, be worked through effectively with the aid of psychedelic psychotherapy. MAPS is currently fundingthe world's only government-approved study of the therapeutic use of MDMA. The research is taking place in Madrid, Spain and is in the early stages with three subjects treated. This dose-response study evaluates the use of MDMA- assisted psychotherapy in women survivors of sexual assault who suffer from chronic posttraumatic stress disorder(PTSD). (http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/spain/mdmaspain.html) MAPS has been seeking for several years to sponsor MDMA/PTSD research at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel. (http://maps.org/research/mdma/israel/index.html) The proposed protocol is an effort to expand the exploration of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy's healing potential to include patients with PTSD due to terrorism and war. The most recent opportunity for MAPS to discuss the MDMA/PTSD research project with Israeli Ministry ofHealth officials took place in Israel at the International Society of Addiction Medicine Conference, held in Tel Aviv from Sept. 9-11. Dr. John Halpern (p. 8), Dr. Evgeny Krupitsky (http://www.maps.org/research/ketamine/ ketrussia.html), and myself attended the conference for MAPS. On Sept. 9, I learned that regulatory approval in Israel would come after the FDA had approved an MDMA/PTSD protocol, but not before. On Sept. 11, Prof. Benny Shanon (p. 48) joined Dr. Halpern and me for lunch. During our conversation, Prof. Shanon informed us that several days before, a friend of his had been killed in a suicide bombing ata train station. After lunch, I walked by a beachside restaurant with a TV tuned to CNN, and watched with horror the events that have shaken our foundations. Stranded in Israel for several more days, I had time to reflect on MAPS' mission, the reason I found myself far away from my wife and children in Boston at such a difficult time. I emerged outof that period of reflection with a renewed commitment to MAPS and its work. Struggling to help people access and use psychedelic tools to facilitate insight, acceptance, inspiration and healing seems at first a weak and feeble counterbalance to virulent hatreds and wholesale slaughter. Yet in the long run, trying to integrate psychedelics intolegal contexts can lead to transformation through personal healing and cultural change. On October 1, MAPS and Dr. Michael Mithoefer submitted our MDMA/PTSD protocol to the FDA. (http:// www.maps.org/research/mdma/index.html#fdamdmaptsd) MAPS has finally completed its two year, $70,000MDMA literature review project (http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/protocol/litreview.html) and a $10,000 MDMA/PTSD protocol development process. By the time you read this, the FDA will have given its initial response to the protocol. In the future, MDMA need not be called Despair. If MAPS members continue their generous support so that we can fund sufficient research and educational projects, and if the FDA continues to place science over drug war politics,then MDMA, other psychedelic drugs and marijuana will in the future be called...FDA-approved! - Rick Doblin, Ph.D., MAPS President Bulletin of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies Volume XI, Number 2m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 12 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 Edited by Rick Doblin and Maggie Hall Layout/Design by Mercedes Paulino ISSN 1080-8981 Printed on recycled paperMAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) is a membership- based organization working to assist psychedelic researchers around the world design, obtain governmental approval, fund, conduct and report on psychedelic research in humans.

I'm Board Certified in Psychiatry and was also board certified in Internal Medicine and Emergency Medicine. I'm also a Grof Certified Holotropic Breathwork Facilitator. A large part of my clinical practice consists of treating pa-tients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). On October 1, 2001, I submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationrequesting permission to conduct a MAPS- sponsored study of MDMA-assisted psycho- therapy for the treatment of PTSD. We areproposing a Phase 2 pilot study of twentypatients with chronic PTSD who have notresponded to at least one attempt at therapywith a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as Prozac or Zoloft, the only kind of medicine approved by the FDA in the treat-ment of PTSD. Phase 2 is the first level atwhich a drug is given to people with a diag-nosed disorder to study the possible therapeu-tic effect. When this study is eventually ap- proved in some form, it will become the first FDA-approved study of the therapeutic use ofMDMA ever conducted. The treatment phase of the study, as we are proposing it, will consist of two MDMA sessions 3-4 weeks apart, using a single dose of125 mg for each session. A male-female therapist team will be with the subjects continuously for the 6-8 hours of the session. The therapeutic method will be based on the model developed by Stanislav Grof, M.D., for LSD psychotherapy and HolotropicBreathwork , and recommended for MDMA-assisted therapy by Ralph Metzner, Ph.D.,and George Greer, M.D., and Requa Tolbert, MSN. In this model, particular attention is paid to set and setting. This will involve adequately preparing the subjects and helping them form clear intentions for the sessions, developing a strong therapeutic alliance, and providing a nurturing physical environment with appropriate music to support the MDMA-assisted psychotherapysession. In addition to the two MDMA sessions, there will be a total of twelve 90-minutesessions with the therapists. The first two of these will be devoted to preparation beforeMDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy in the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Protocol Submitted to FDA on October 1, 2001 By Michael Mithoefer, M.D. (mmithoefer@home.com) I \"When this study is eventually approvedin some form, firstFDA-approved studyof the therapeuticuse of MDMA everconducted. \"4 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1the drug sessions. The remaining ten will be to provide support and integration after the sessions. This will be a \"double blind\" study in which 12 of the subjects will receive MDMA and 8 will receive an inactive placebo. Neither the investigators nor the subjects will know which has been administered. The nature of thetreatment and follow-up sessions will be the same for eachgroup. The reason for having a placebo group is to helpus distinguish the effects of the intensive therapy sessions alone from the effects of the MDMA in conjunction with the therapy. After 3 months, if the subjects who receivedplacebo are still having PTSD symptoms, they will havethe option of having two MDMA-psychotherapy ses-sions and subsequent follow-up sessions. At the beginning of the study and at several points after the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions, inde- pendent raters will administer psychological rating scalesto measure any changes in PTSD symptoms. Neuropsy-chological testing will also be done at the outset and thecompletion of the study. Careful medical monitoringwill be performed throughout the study period. We recognize that in this small pilot study, we will not be able to prove the presence or absence of a statistically signifi-cant therapeutic effect from the MDMA. What we hopeto do is to show a strong likelihood of efficacy so we canthen apply for a larger Phase 3, trial which would be moredefinitive. My fellow investigators on the application are, Mark Wagner, Ph.D. and Annie Mithoefer, BSN. Mark isAssociate Professor of Neurology at The Medical Univer-sity of South Carolina and Director of the Neuropsychol-ogy Section. He also has an extensive research back-ground and many publica- tions related to neuropsy- chology. Much of his clini-cal work has involved assess-ment of patient response topharmacological agents.Annie is a registered nurse and is a Grof Certified Holotropic Breathwork Fa-cilitator. She and I have had years of experience facilitat- ing Holotropic Breathwork groups together and will beco-therapists for all the MDMA sessions. Matt Baggott,BA and Ilsa Jerome, Ph.D. have spent vast amounts of time writing a litera-ture review and sev- eral other sections that are part of our FDA application. I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to collaborate with all of them. Another aspect of this process that's been tremendously exciting and gratifying is the level ofsupport we've received from MAPS and from manypeople who believe strongly in the importance of thiskind of work. Rick Doblin's enthusiasm, encyclopedicknowledge of the issues involved and confidence that MAPS can raise the money for the study, are what allowed me to realize this could be accomplished in thefirst place. Since then we've received an amazing flow ofinvaluable advice and encouragement from many experi-enced clinicians and researchers from across the U.S. andEurope. All their generous help has brought us to this point with the application. Accompanying the applica- tion will be letters of support from: Charles Grob, M.D.,Chief of Child Psychiatry at UCLA and principalinvestigator in one of the phase 1 MDMA trials in theU.S., Euphrosyne Gouzoulis-Mayfrank, M.D., one ofthe leading world authorities on the neuropsychological effects of MDMA, and Franz Vollenweider, , M.D., Ph.D., Head of Behavioral Pharmacology at the Psychi-atric University Hospital in Zurich, who has done verysophisticated prospective studies using PET scans andpsychological testing before and after MDMA. In addi-tion to his letter of support, he is allowing us to include his data, which shows no evidence of adverse effects from MDMA at the doses we will be using. Now we're eagerly awaiting a response from the FDA, and hope to get started with the study in the nearfuture. \"The reason for having a placebo group is to help us distinguish the effects of the intensivetherapy sessions alone from the effects of theMDMA in conjunction with the therapy. \" \"...we've received an amazing flow of invaluable advice and encouragement from manyexperienced clinicians and researchers fromacross the U.S. and Europe. \"5 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1Preliminary Report Chronic Cannabis Use in the Compassionate Investigational New Drug Program: An Examination of Benefits and Adverse Effects of Legal Clinical Cannabis By Ethan Russo (erusso@blackfoot.net), Mary Lynn Mathre, Al Byrne, Robert Velin, Paul J. Bach, and Juan Sanchez-Ramos \"Preliminary results demonstrate clinical effectiveness in thesepatients in treating glaucoma,chronic musculo-skeletal pain,spasm and nausea, and spasticityof multiple sclerosis. \"The Missoula Chronic Clinical Cannabis Use Study was proposed to investigate the therapeutic benefits and adverse effects of prolonged use of \"medical marijuana\" in a cohort of seriously ill patients approved through the Compassionate IND (Investigational New Drug Program) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for legal use of cannabis obtained fromthe National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), under the supervision of a study physician. The aim was to study the overall health status of 4 of the 7 surviving patients in the program. Unfortunately, its first patient, Robert Randall, passed away of complication of AIDS during the course of the study. The program began in 1976 when Randall successfully won a legal case dem- onstrating the medical necessity of cannabis to treat his progressive glaucoma. This project provides a unique and important opportunity to scrutinize long-term effects of cannabis on patients who have used a known dosage of a standardized, heat-sterilized quality- controlled supply of low-grade marijuana from 10 to 19 years. Prelimi- nary results demonstrate clinical effectiveness in these patients in treating glaucoma, chronic musculo-skeletal pain, spasm and nausea, and spasticity of multiple sclerosis.All 4 patients are stable with respect to their chronic conditions, and are taking many fewer standard pharmaceuticals than they were previously. Mild changes in pulmonary function were observed in 2 patients, while no significant attributable sequelae were noted in any otherphysiological system examined in the study, which included: MRI scans of the brain, pulmonary function tests (spirometry), chest X-ray, neuropsychological tests, hormone and immunological assays, electroencephalography P300 testing (a computerized EEG test of memory), andneurological history and clinical examination. These results would support the provision of clinical cannabis to a greater number of patients in need. We believe that cannabis can be a safe and effective medicine with various suggested improvements in the existing Compassionate INDprogram. This study was supported by the generous assistance of MAPS, John Gilmore, Preston Parish in memory of W. Erastus Upjohn, and the Zimmer Family Foundation. It is dedicated to thememory of Bob Randall.6 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 MAPS Medical Marijuana Production Facility: A Progress Report By Rick Doblin, Ph.D. (rick@maps.org ) nspectors from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health visited University of Massachusetts/Amherst (UMass Amherst)in early August to look at the facility where UMass Amherst Professor Lyle Craker, with a grant from MAPS, is proposing tocreate a DEA-licensed medical marijuana production facility to grow marijuana for use in FDA-approved clinical research projects. The inspectors asked a series of reasonable questions and seemed generally sympathetic. Prof. Craker and MAPS have submitted awritten response to the questions and await a response from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The questions asked were the following: 1. From where will we obtain seeds? 2. Who will fund the research? 3. Who will dry the material? Other processing steps? Where? 4. How will the material be transported? 5. Overall purpose of production? The big picture? The part UMass plays? Our answers are as follows: 1. From where will we obtain seeds? Once we have legal permission for the growing operation, we will explore importing them from a licensed supplier in either the Netherlands, England or Canada, all of which have legal medicalmarijuana growing operations. We will also try to see if we could obtain them from the University of Mississippi, where NIDA's supply is grown. However, they probably have seeds of too low a quality (though perhaps their low quality product is due to production methods rather than poor quality seeds). I don't see any point in trying to resolve this issue further until we have permission but can do so if necessary. 2. Who will fund the research? MAPS, in the form of a grant to UMass Amherst. 3. Who will dry the material? Other processing steps? Where?The material will be dried at UMass Amherst. We will try not to have to produce the6 \"Professor Lyle Craker, with a grant from MAPS, isproposing to create aDEA-licensed productionfacility to grow marijuanafor use in FDA-approvedclinical researchprojects. \"m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 17 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1material into standardized joints of uniform weight, but will simply try to provide it to patients as buds in weighedcontainers to use in vaporizers or for self-rolling. The material produced at the U. of Mississippi is shipped to Research Triangle Institute for rolling into joints, whichwe could also do if necessary. This is an issue for the specific researchers to negotiate with FDA. One of the advantages of the use ofmarijuana as medicine is that patients can self-ti- trate, and one of the ad-vantages of the use of va- porizers is the reduction in particulate matter. It therefore may be possible to negotiate with FDA to provide mari-juana for use in vaporiz- ers. This is an issue that does not need to be re-solved at this time but must be resolved by ne- gotiation between re-searchers and FDA. We will do whatever is required. Perhaps FDA may even negotiate different arrangements with different research-ers. If more information is required at this point, we can get more specific. 4. How will the material be transported? In accordance with standard DEA procedures for shipping Schedule 1 drugs intended for FDA-approved research. This usually means FedX with DEA Form 222. 5. Overall purpose of production? The big picture? The part UMass Amherst plays? The major purpose of production is to develop high- quality material for FDA-approved research. MAPS has received Orphan Drug designation from FDA for the useof marijuana for AIDS wasting disease. The long-term goal is to develop marijuana in plant form as an FDA- approved medicine, not just for AIDS wasting patients,but also for other indications. No material will be supplied to patients outside of FDA- and DEA-approved protocols. This means that no Massachusetts patientswill be supplied marijuana unless they are part of FDA- approved research protocols. This is NOT an attempt to produce material for Massachusetts patients in the eventthat a Massachusetts State medical marijuana initiative passes, unless the Massachusetts Department of Public Health works something out with FDA. Another purpose of production is to facilitate re-search at UMass Amherst into the production of mari- juana for medical purposes. This can include research into different growing techniques, genetic research, oranything else that Professor Craker is interested in study- ing. NIDA-produced marijuana is low-quality and is not easily obtainable, thus even privately funded research is restricted only to pro- tocols approved byFDA and also by a spe- cial Public Health Ser- vice (PHS) review pro-cess. Privately-funded researchers interestedin studying any other Schedule 1 drug, such as MDMA, LSD,DMT and psilocybin, do not need to go through this PHS re-view since NIDA does not retain a monopoly on the supply of these drugs. NIDA only has a monopoly on the supply of marijuana for FDA-approved research. NIDA has re- fused to supply its marijuana to some FDA-approvedresearchers, even though the researchers were going to pay NIDA for the costs of the marijuana and the studies were going to be privately funded. Some researchers havebeen discouraged from even applying to FDA for permis- sion to conduct research with marijuana in plant form. If initial pilot studies are promising and large-scale trials are approved, and especially if FDA ever approves the use of marijuana for prescription use, the amount that is needed to be produced will increase over the initialestimate of 25 pounds per year. If that occurs, MAPS and UMass Amherst will negotiate a contract to produce whatever amounts are required. Perhaps UMass Amherstwould prefer to continue to grow smaller quantities for research purposes only and have any larger quantities produced by a private company, perhaps with some linkto UMass Amherst. We will explore all these options together at the appropriate time, though these discus- sions would probably not be needed for at least severalyears after production begins to take place. Now we wait for the next round of questions from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. If we domanage to obtain approval from the Massachusetts De- partment of Public Health, negotiations will begin in earnest with DEA. The Washington, DC law firm,Covington & Burling, will likely assist MAPS and UMass Amherst on a pro bono basis in those negotiations.\"NiDA has refused to supply its marijuana to some FDA-approvedresearchers, even though theresearchers were going to payNiDA for the costs of the marijuanaand the studies were going to beprivately funded. \"8 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1Research at Harvard Medical School By John H. Halpern, M.D. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research CenterMcLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School(john_halpern@hms.harvard.edu) In 1999 I published a paper reviewing the medical literature on whether or not hallucinogens cause long-term brain damage with functional conse-quences (Halpern JH, Pope HG Jr. Do Hallucinogens Cause ResidualNeuropsychological Toxicity? Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 53:247-256,1999). For many MAPS members, I am sure it comes as no surprise that theupshot of this review is that very little research actually has been doneconcerning this question and that most of the existing work is filled with avariety of methodological flaws \u2014 leaving the question essentially unan-swered. Serious design flaws continue to this day: many studies of residual effects from MDMA abuse, for example, include users with a history of dependenceon other compounds already known to have CNS (central nervous system) toxicity. Moreover, all neurocognitive evaluations have been performed with the assumption that the test subjects' reports of drug use are accurate. Witha substantial fraction of street MDMA not containing any MDMA at all, itis difficult to be certain that any of the adverse effects reported in thispopulation are actually the result of MDMA. Clearly, before specificallycondemning MDMA or a classical hallucinogen as a cause of brain damage,it is important to determine whether these agents are truly neurotoxic, or whether neuropsychological deficits reported in users are actually the result of othersubstances used on the street, or are perhaps due to unrelated confounding variables. Returning to our question, then: do hallucinogens cause residual neuropsychologi- cal toxicity? For many people, this question is not as interesting to answer (or read about)as, say, a clinical study in which subjects are actually provided hallucinogens to assess risks and benefits. But, actually, the study I amcompleting on neurocognition is quite excit-ing and the information we are gaining aboutlife-long hallucinogen use should offer a con-siderable improvement on previous studies.Specifically, it happens that while mescalineand its principal natural source, peyote(lophophora williamsii), are Schedule 1 sub-stances, peyote is the legal sacrament for some300,000 American citizens who count them-selves members of the Native American \"...the study l am completing on neurocognition is quite exciting andthe information we are gaining aboutlife-long hallucinogen use shouldoffer a considerable improvement onprevious studies. \" 9 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1Church (NAC). Here, then, is a populationwith legitimate access to a known hallucinogenwhile the tenets of the religion clearly frown onthe use of drugs of abuse and alcohol. Literally,when peyote is consumed as part of the expres-sion of the faith of the Native AmericanChurch, peyote is not a drug being ingested: itis the non-drug, sacramental use of peyote. For several years now our research team has been administering a large battery of neurocognitive tests toNative Americans who either are life-long members ofthe NAC (never having problems with drugs or alcohol),or Native Americans who are in good sobriety now buthave a history of heavy alcoholism (never having prob-lems with other drugs and are not NAC members), orNative Americans who are not NAC members nor everhad problems with drugs or alcohol. A total of 210individuals are being recruited (70 in each cell) and thenare tested by a psychologist who is unaware of their groupassignment. Tests of executive cortical functioning (i.e.processes such as decision-making, categorizing, etc.),visuospatial functioning, IQ, memory, and other types ofstandardized word games and puzzles are administeredover three hours. Ultimately, the study should provideanswers to lingering questions of brain toxicity fromextended hallucinogen use as well as reconfirming thelasting impact that alcohol has upon cognition. I have been steadily building a research career to study the effects (positive and negative) of hallucinogens inman for 8 years now. Mostly, I have tried to keep \"underthe radar\" of the public eye because, while the need foreducation is great, I believe the greatest impact of thisresearch will be in doing this work, reporting it, andletting the facts speak for themselves. \"Talk less...domore.\" There are a number of \"experts\" out there lectur-ing and writing, but few are or ever have been engaged inactive research projects in the United States dealing withthe direct effects of hallucinogens in people. It certainlywould be nice to have more colleagues working in thisarea, and eventually that should happen.\"l am deeply thankful to MAPS for its donation of $10,000, which is critically assisting us with ancillary and supportive expenses....\" In the meantime, it is the dedicated support from MAPS and the Heffter Research Institute and the Na-tional Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) that is making itpossible for me to patiently, cautiously, methodicallyforge ahead a research career in this sometimes controver-sial area with sufficient rigor that the results shouldgenerally be accepted as scientifically sound and unbi-ased. I am deeply thankful to MAPS for its donation of$10,000, which is critically assisting us with ancillary andsupportive expenses that could not otherwise be paid forfrom my other funding sources. I am also grateful toNIDA for funding research in this controversial area. TheUnited States has a tremendous shortage of qualifiedresearch doctors, so things move slowly these days be-cause not enough people are going to medical school andthen jumping through the years and years of hoopsnecessary for a medical research career with hallucino-gens. This is a difficult path and it is humbling. Therereally is a tremendous amount of work to be done. \"...many studies of residual effects from MDMA abuse, forexample, include users with ahistory of dependence onother compounds alreadyknown to have CNS toxicity. \"10 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1Interview with Dr. John Halpern s a researcher, you want to report the facts,\" said Dr. John Halpern as we sat on his patio during a chilly desert evening in Farmington, New Mexico. \"Here we have peyote, the natural source for mescaline and it is listed as a Schedule I substance of abuse. I do not believe that members of the Native American Church (NAC) are using a Schedule I substance. Literally, this is an example of the non-drug sacramental use of peyote. We need to respect these people's culture.\" A reporter once called Halpern \"the antidote to Timothy Leary.\" He earned this name because his current study involving NAC members is assessing the safety of peyote. His findings may reopen the doors that were shut in the 1960s after Leary's famed psilocybin experiments. Hopefully, after Halpern has undone some of the fear and misconceptions that currently surround psychedelics, future research into the therapeutic uses of psychedelics will become commonplace once again. \"This is something that should have been done a long time ago,\" he said. \"It is something that may lead us to some important medical discoveries (about the therapeutic uses of psychedelics). Having a study that accurately addresses, 'Does this cause cognitive brain damage?' makes people feel a little more comfortable in eventually doing clinical evaluations again, which are definitely controversial.\" I had the pleasure of visiting the doctor this summer in the unfurnished house where he stays while doing his research. He leaves his Boston home to live and work in this house for weeks at a time and has been coming out here since 1997. It is only a half-hour drive from here to the Navajo (Din\u00e9) reservation, where most of his test subjects live. Specifically, Halpern is investigating whether cognitive brain damage can be found in Navajo peyote-users by comparing them with Navajo who do not use peyote but have had alcoholism in the past and with Navajo who are lifetime abstainers from all substances. Halpern describes the study and answers any questions the participants may have before asking any questions. If they pass the screening questions, an informed consent form is reviewed and signed, and then he interviews the subjects about personal and family health and education as well as administering a few brief multiple choice tests. If the subjects are not excluded from the study after completing this interview, they are then invited to return for a second three hour session of neuropsychological tests of memory, intelligence, attention, discrimination, and so on. The category of each test subject is not revealed to Andrea Sherwood (the psychologist who conducts these neuropsychological tests) in order to avoid potential bias against members of any one group. By studying NAC members use of peyote as opposed to, say, college students' use of LSD, a major methodological flaw found in most psychedelic studies is avoided: \"Most people who have used hallucinogens hundreds of times are actuallyBy Valerie Mojeiko (valerie_mojeiko@yahoo.com ) m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 \"Dr. Halpern is investigating whether cognitive brain damage can be found in Navajo peyote-users by comparing them with Navajo who do not use peyote but have had alcoholism in the past and with Navajo who are lifetime abstainers from all substances.\"A1011 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 poly-drug users,\" said Halpern. \"Peyote is not a drug for these people. Their religion strongly discourages the use of illegal substances or alcohol.\" In the afternoon, the time of day when the sun takes control of the desert, we visited a flea market in the town of Shiprock, on the Navajo reservation just outside of Farmington. The vendors sell blue corn mush, medicinal herbal smokes, and copious amounts of beautiful hand- beaded jewelry. We are the only white people there. I try to imagine how it could have been possible for this white doctor to convince hundreds of Navajo to come to his house in Farmington and tell him about their personal, spiritual life. \"These are people who hate research,\" Halpern explained. \"It automatically makes them feel like they are going to be put under a microscope. It is a huge hurdle to make them feel comfortable. For two years, I came out here just for informational meetings. I wanted people to know that I was going to keep coming back.\" Halpern relates a particular story to us that illustrates one of the obstacles he faced in working with the Navajo, \"One time early on there was an annual meeting of the NAC that I attended with 200 members in the audience. I presented to them what I was hoping to do, and an elder got up and spoke for 20 minutes in Navajo. I had no idea what he was saying; he just spoke to the crowd. Then he turned to me and said in English, '1492!' Then he went back to speaking in Navajo. I quietly said to myself, 'Boy, I sure have a lot to atone for!' It's probably why no one has ever done a study like this before, and will never do so again.\" A major benefit of this study for Halpern was being able to work with the Navajo people. \"I know that 20 years from now, if I were broke and walking around on Navajo Nation, someone would recognize me and ask, 'Do you need a meal or a shelter?' We (Americans) are a culture of takers. These are a people who have a culture of sharing. (Being around the Navajo culture) was a big part of (the experience).\" Halpern first became interested in psychedelic re- search when his parents hosted a professor from British Columbia. \"He was telling me about how he came across the NAC in Canada in the 1950s,\" explained Halpern,\"and how [peyote] helped them recover from alcoholism. I wound up doing a literature search and looking for articles. I was fascinated that hallucinogens could be used to treat alcoholism.\" In his last year of medical school, Halpern did a sub-internship with Dr. Rick Strassman, who was doing a study on DMT. DMT is a short acting psychedelic that is also manufactured in minute amounts in the body. Strassman's study explored the effect of DMT on hu- mans in a controlled hospital setting. \"I was helping him while DMT was administered to the volunteers,\" said Halpern. \"I was really impressed by the fact that there seems to be a real therapeutic potential there that should be investigated. I was blown away by that work.\" While working with Strassman, Halpern also pored over articles in the library of the University of New Mexico. This eventually led to his first literature review called, \"The Use of Hallucinogens in the Treatment of Addiction.\" (Halpern JH. Addiction Research, 1994). \"In my last year of psychiatric residency at Harvard (97-98), I also started a 3-year fellowship in addiction research with Dr. Jack Mendelson and Dr. Harrison G. Pope, Jr., and I have continued to collaborate with them to this day,\" continued Halpern. \"Our facility, the Alco- hol and Drug Abuse Research Center at McLean Hospi- tal (the principal psychiatry teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School) has a long history of properly conduct- ing research with Schedule I substances. This has been a great home for my continued training and for my work.\" Halpern hopes to do more research with the Navajo in the future. \"I have all of these friends now who are important to me on a personal level, but I also know that it is essential to keep working at building bridges across the many cultural divides for any further work to come about. One day, I hope to do a prospective treatment study of peyote for alcoholism. I would be working very closely with Navajo people on this study. Right now it is being used as an informal treatment. There are constantly people who stop drinking alcohol after participating in the peyote meetings of the Native American Church.\" \"I am not interested in seeing peyote taken from the Native Americans and processed and turned into some commercial medication. It is sacred to them and should be honored that way. When I speak with Native Ameri- can Church members about peyote, they tell me, 'This is good medicine for me, doc.' And I tell them, 'I believe you.' These people genuinely try to say what they mean and mean what they say. Peyote is their medicine - their sacrament - and it's been saving lives for thousands of years.\"\"We need to respect these people's culture.\"12 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1A Dissertation On The Constructive (Therapeutic and Religious) Use of Psychedelics:A Request for Support By Hans C. Ossebaard (intox@wanadoo.nl) INTOX- Research & Consultancy on Drug IssuesUtrecht, The Netherlands Regular funding for off-mainstream research is hard to find, even in The Nether- lands. After ten years of studying, lecturing about and researching drug use, I've decidedto compose a thesis (dissertation) from published and unpublished research material at the 365-year old Utrecht University. Some additional study, however, is needed to complete this enterprise, which is focused on understanding drug use not as pathologi-cal, criminal or otherwise deviant behavior, but as a functional, constructive, meaningful drive. For this additional work I will need about $3000 in order to cover traveling costs, pharmacological analyses of ayahuasca tea (DMT/harmaline alkaloids) and smallcompensations for respondents. All other expenses are covered by private money. The thesis starts out in Chapter 1, with a discussion of motivational science and the exploration of altered states of consciousness (ASC). It isargued that the omnipresent health concept of 'risk' is only one aspect of the meaning of drug use for the user, very much like it is one aspect of driving for the driver. Tounderstand the significance of drug use, one has to move to other meaningful aspects. Critical issues of methodology in drug research are discussed from the viewpoint that most ofour knowledge of, for instance, addiction, is in fact con- structed by the way social science operates in an anti-drug context. These and other issues provide a theoretical frame-work that relates the themes to be treated in the following chapters. Several settings have been studied where people delib- erately sought to explore altered states of consciousness for therapeutic reasons, for spiritual/religious reasons and for recreational reasons. Chapter 2 deals with hallucinogenicdrugs and the therapy of the Dutch psychiatrist Bastiaans, who treated many patients who were traumatized by the Second World War, mostly resistance fighters and concen-tration camp survivors, who would now be diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The small survey indicates that severe, chronic symptoms and complaints have been palliated or cured in his 'psycholitic' therapy. As oftoday, a majority of our respondents indicate partial to complete recovery from the traumas and related symptoms from which they suffered upon entering LSD (and/or ketamine and/or psilocybin) assisted treatment. They were and are positively satisfied\"Several settings have been studied where people deliberately sought to explore altered states of consciousness for therapeutic reasons, for spiritual/religious reasons and for recreational reasons.\"13 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1with their treatment [See: Ossebaard, H.C. & Maalst\u00e9, N.

A series of 10-20 ad- ditional in-depth interviews will be done in 2001/2002with the elderly respondents who are willing to partici- pate. Chapter 3 is about DMT and contemporary ritual. The Santo Daime church is a 'new age' religion rooted in ancient Amazonian shamanism. The ritual use of a natural psychoactive preparation called 'ayahuasca tea'(containing the indole an indole alkaloid, harmaline) is an essential feature of this religion. The drink hastraditionally been used for medical and religious reasons without any acknowledged risks to public health. The modern use of ayahuasca as a sacrament of Santo Daimein the United States and Europe has involved thousands of persons seeking religious, spiritual truth and mental well-being without any reported serious problems. Forthis reason its ritual use is no longer illicit in The Netherlands, according to a recent legal verdict (May, 2001). The research for this chapter will be conducted incollaboration with the Dutch ethnopharmacological foundation 'Friends of the Forest' and the Dutch branch of the Santo Daime church. In 2001/02 we aim to studyadult, consensual and motivated Santo Daime congregants who will complete a translated version of Strassman's Hallucinogenic Rating Scale. Pharmacologi-cal samples of the preparation will also be taken. We hope to be able to show the specific spiritual meaning of intoxication in a religious setting and the moderatingmotivational variables, and to compare them interna- tionally. Chapter 4 comprises the 'cyberdelic experience'. Altered states of consciousness may be achieved not only by the use of psychoactive substances but also by involve- ment in a range of intensifying experiences. Illustrationsof the latter are dancing or meditation. Rhythmic (audio)visual stimulation is another method of proveneffectiveness with regard to ASC. In the 2nd Century AD, the Greek astronomer Ptolemy described how dur-ing an experiment, the rays of sunlight falling through a rotating spoked wheel were forming patterns of color andlight that induced euphoria in a bystander. The 19th Century French psychologist Pierre Janetdiscovered the calming effect of flickering light on his hysteric patients. In correspondencewith cultural and technological changes, human aspirations for ASC find new routes. Brainwave synchronizers are examples of today's non-drug tech- nologies. They are said to induce a relaxation response by entraining alpha brain-wave (8-13 Hz) activity, even inthe long-term. These and other claims galvanized their therapeutical and recreational use. The latter was rein- forced due to the similarities between subjective experi-ences with 'digital drugs' and drug-induced experience. The present study investigates the major assertions with regard to stress reduction in a double blind quasi-experi-ment. The results show that immediate relaxation effects are attained though not in the longer term [See: Ossebaard, H.C. (2000). Stress reduction by technology.An experimental study into the effects of brain machines on burnout and state anxiety. Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback 25(2), p.93-102]. The last chapter will be a summary and concluding discussion of the psychological and cultural meaning of ASC, the pursuit of which may be an inherent humanmotivation. In the summer of 2002 most of the addi- tional work (on LSD and DMT) will be done if I can find some financial support. Later next year, I will try topublish the results for a wider audience. Thus, I hope to contribute to a climate of freedom and understanding with regard to the issue of drug use.

On Labor Day weekend, I went to the Hookahville music festival near Columbus, Ohio, with a group of volunteers interested in learning how to help people undergoingdifficult psychedelic experiences. We were accompanied by MAPS president RickDoblin, who helped to organize the project and enlist our team, and by an experiencedunderground psychedelic therapist, who led a training session for our group. Hookahville is a three-day camping event celebrating the Ohio band Ekoostik Hookah, and featuring other bands (this year Little Feat and The Wailers also played).Like most big music fests, Hookahville draws thousands of young people, many of whomenjoy their music under the influence of LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, and other psychoac-tive substances. With over ten thousand people camped out at Buckeye Lake (an oldGrateful Dead venue), more than a few end up overwhelmed, disoriented, andoccasionally panicked. Working under the supervision of Hookahville's medical staff, we created the Serenity Tent, a safe space for those in altered states. Over the weekend, we worked withabout twenty-five individuals, most of whom were under the influence of MDMA, LSD,or psilocybin, often in combination and/or in combination with alcohol or marijuana.By the time they reached our facilities, people were oftenextremely disoriented, frightened, or agitated. Theywere sometimes unaware of their surroundings or un-able to communicate. Some wandered in, others werebrought kicking and screaming by the medical team,some were introduced by concerned friends, and otherswe found lost and incoherent on the concert grounds. Our group, composed of volunteers from MAPS, DanceSafe, and Students for a Sensible Drug Policy,tried to help each person in a way most suited to theirneeds. Often this simply meant providing a quiet placeaway from the music and crowds, reassuring people andinviting them to feel safe in their surroundings. We helpedpeople face the issues that troubled them, guiding them in a supportive but directmanner. We also encouraged people to use art supplies to express non-verbally some ofwhat was taking place internally. MAPS also arranged for DanceSafe to conduct on-site pill testing at the venue, identifying adulterants in pills sold as MDMA and providing harm reduction informa-tion to concertgoers. We facilitated communication between the DanceSafe team and By Brandy Doyle (brandy@maps.org)MAPS Leavesthe Labs,Headsfor theConcertGroundsWorking with Difficult Psychedelic Experiences \"...more than a few end up overwhelmed, disoriented, and occasionally panicked.\"15 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1the medics so that the medical staff would be aware of the ec-stasy adulterants being in-gested. Everyone we counseled eventually calmed down with-out requiring a visit to the emer-gency room or the aid of tran-quilizers. We were also able tohelp some people work onlarger problems in their lives,problems that contributed totheir having a difficult psyche-delic experience in the first place. Helping people facetheir fears and concerns probably reduced longer-termpsychological issues. According to the medical unit, we reduced the aver- age time individuals were held for observation and re-lieved pressure on their medical facilities. It also seemslikely that more at-risk concertgoers received medicalevaluation than would have otherwise; many peopleseemed to trust our group more than the medical orsecurity teams, and accepted attention from the medics atour recommendation. At least six people came to the tent under the influ- ence of ecstasy but none suffered from overheating,serious dehydration, or other physical problems. Thismay be due, in part, to DanceSafe's efforts toidentify fake pills sold as ecstasy. Our staff evenheard a report that dealers threw out an entirebottle of pills after discovering that the pillscontained not MDMA but DXM, a dissocia-tive which is more harmful than MDMA andcan cause dehydration and heat stroke, espe-cially in combination with MDMA and/oralcohol. The most rewarding work was that of help- ing people face deeper issues in their lives. Onewoman who came to us under the influence ofLSD arrived in our tent yelling and talkingincessantly. Over several hours of gently guid-ing her to work with her feelings, we learnedthat she was considering a divorce from anabusive husband, and she feared that she wouldlose custody of her children. She was shouting withoutpause to avoid facing her own thoughts, forcing herattention outward. Eventually, as she grew to feel safewith us and in her own thoughts, she was able to let go ofher denial, and by the end of the evening she lay in a fetalposition, sobbing unrestrainedly. It was a powerful expe-rience for everyone there to see her begin to accept her grief and fear,the first step in coping with herdifficult future. Earlier in the weekend, a young man under the influence of ecstasycame to the tent, feeling fine butwishing to talk about other prob-lems in his life. He had been experi-encing panic attacks for two years,particularly when smoking mari-juana. The panic attacks dated backto a traumatic experience with LSD, and he worked with our volunteers to understand why hehad these experiences, and how to work with and learnfrom the panic rather than try to suppress it. We also were able to use our knowledge of psychedelics to assist the medical team. In one case, themedics restrained a young man under the influence ofdatura, a disorienting and potentially harmful botanicalpsychedelic. Before the medics were able to get informa-tion back from the Poison Control Center, a therapistwith our group was able to tell them the duration andphysiological effects of the drug. Minutes later, thePoison Control Center reported the same information.We spent about four hours with this person, calming himand helping him achieve a more normal consciousness in a shorter time than was anticipated. We also humanized his treatment. Though he was restrained by the medics,tied to a cot by his hands and feet, he was able to be withhis friends, who brought a guitar and sang him a song. \"...we hope that the success of our pilotprogram will encourageevent promoters toconsider funding similarprograms themselves. \" The Serenity Tent at Hookahville XVI near Columbus, Ohio, Labor Day weekend. 16 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1A small step in the right direction From our perspective, the Hookahville project was very successful in furthering our educational mission. Byhelping to reduce harms related to psychedelic use,MAPS is acknowledging the risks as well as the benefits ofpsychedelics. This came through in some local mediaattention the project received, a large article on the frontpage of the feature section in the Sunday Sarasota Herald- Tribune on September 9, 2001. The story, headlined \"Psychedelic Studies,\" focused on our project atHookahville and on the personalities of the MAPSvolunteers from Sarasota who participated. [read onlineat http://maps.org/media/hookahville.html] Hookahville was also an opportunity for us to in- crease awareness of psychedelic therapy and its potentialbenefits. We were able to teach, and learn, about the theory and practice of \"sitting\" for those in altered states. It was amazing to participate in the work of simply \"beingthere\" for people and allowing them to open up to theirexperiences. During the weekend, we also met and strategized with national board members from Students for a Sen-sible Drug Policy, the heads of local DanceSafe chapters,and other young people who are working on legal,cultural, and health issues regarding psychedelics. Hopefully, this networking will strengthen all ofthe groups involved and facilitate more collabora- tive work. Though MAPS is unlikely to fund projects similar to the \"Serenity Tent\" in the future, wehope that the success of our pilot program willencourage event promoters to consider fundingsimilar programs themselves. Not only did our presence make Hookahville a safer and friendliervenue, we saved the management considerable time, resources, and police interaction. the bigger perspective It was an interesting experience, and a testament to the necessity of a new model for psychedelic use in ourculture. Most of those we helped made it to our tentbecause they were making poor and uniformed choices.For example, a number of individuals reported ingestingMDMA, psilocybin, marijuana, and a six-pack of cheapbeer. I found that my training in coping with psychedeliccrises didn't wholly prepare me for the \"let's get fuckedup\" attitude I saw around me. As long as psychedelics are illegal, the contexts in which they are available will continue to be limited. Thetools for understanding and working with psychedelicexperiences will be limited. For many people, usingpsychedelics is, like other illegal activities, associatedmore strongly with self-destruction than self-awareness.Unfortunately, sometimes even those who choose to takepsychedelics absorb this attitude, which affects their choices and their understanding of themselves.Criminalization limits the possible interpreta-tions of psychedelic experience, leaving users toa recreational model that does not speak to theemotional or spiritual issues that can arise, or tothe process of integrating psychedelic experi-ence into the rest of one's life. This was vividly illustrated for me as I sat with a sixteen-year old boy during his firstpsychedelic experience, a mushroom trip. The medical staff had found him standing rigidly near thestage, oblivious to his surroundings. We stayed with himfor hours, sitting with him as he lay quietly in our tent. Atthe end of the night, he told us he had a beautifulexperience, and would consequently repeat it the follow-ing evening. We saw him early that afternoon, just hoursafter he left our tent, and he reported that he had takenLSD for the first time. \"ln response to our society's harmful system for educating young peopleabout drugs, MAPS is initiating theRites of Passage project. \" Jennifer Landis, Students for Sensible Drug Policy; Matt Mazzuckelli, SSDP; Rick Doblin, MAPS president;and Sandra Karpetas, Higher Knowledge Network.17 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 A Note of Appreciation from Someone helped at Hookahville: Hey Rick.

Thanks again, man.Anonymous What a shame! Without a cultural context with which to make sense of his experience, without guidanceto help make responsible choices, this young manhassought to explore psychedelics in the only way he'sfound: haphazardly. Probably he has never had an open,honest dialogue about psychedelics with his parents or hisdoctor, his teacher, religious leader, or therapist. In asense, the young people who find themselves in a tent likea psychedelic Civil War hospital really are war victims,casualties of the Drug War that prevents open communi-cation and responsibility regarding psychedelics. A better model for youthful exploration In response to our society's harmful system for edu- cating young people about drugs, MAPS is initiating theRites of Passage project. In Ohio, we worked with peopleexperimenting with psychedelics as young as 14 and 15years old. Because those who explore with psychedelicsare most often young people, we hope to open dialoguesbetween young people and their parents about the poten-tial value and risks of psychedelic use. This Rites ofPassage project is an attempt to find new ways to integratepsychedelics and marijuana into our culture. Over the coming months, MAPS will be collecting stories of families who value psychedelics for a Rites ofPassage section of our website. We are trying to findparents who have introduced their children topsychedelics or marijuana, or children who have intro-duced their parents to these substances. We're especiallyseeking stories told from both generations, in whichparents and children can each write about their experi-ences from their own unique perspectives, with theirstories posted together in a family narrative. We want tolearn what sort of drug education parents have given theirchildren, or children have given their parents, and how that education was received, believed, and used. By presenting stories of supportive, responsible use, MAPS hopes to give families a better range of alternativesfor talking and thinking about psychedelics and mari-juana. With the help of our members, we hope to movethe use of psychedelics beyond music fests and emergencytents, and into the realm of scientific research and culturalsupport.

Our journey began at 2:00 a.m. ona Friday morning at the dorms of New College in Sarasota, Florida. That was when my fellow students, Brandy and Jag, and I embarked on our trip to Atlanta where we would enter anotherrealm of consciousness with the guidance of psychedelic pioneer Dr. Stanislav Grof. Holotropic Breathwork was developed by Dr. Grof as a non-drug alternative to reaching altered states of consciousness. When doing Holotropic Breathwork, one breathes in such a way as to flood thebody with oxygen. A buildup of oxygen in the blood in combination with evocative music and a specialset and setting causes the breather to experience a sort of mild trip. Types of experience usually fall intoone or more of several categories - sensory, biographic, perinatal, and yogic sleep states. HolotropicBreathwork incorporates techniques from modern consciousness research, anthropology, various depth psychologies, transpersonal psychology, Eastern spiritual prac-tices, and mystical traditions of the world to form a profound approach to self-exploration and healing. The nameHolotropic literally means \"moving toward wholeness.\" Our journey brought us to Stanislav Grof's final U.S. breathwork workshop, as he will soon retire from facilitatingHolotropic Breathwork after having passed on the skills needed to conduct workshops to the many facilitators. Theworkshop was held April 20-22, 2001, in a secluded hotel justoutside of Atlanta, Georgia. As Brandy, Jag, and I wandered through the hallways on the morning of our arrival, we could identify the other Breathwork participants by their oversized smiles and invitingeyes. Besides these two similarities, the crowd was surprisingly heterogeneous. The approximately six hundred people inattendance broke into more intimate groups of twenty each for the therapeutic breathing and sharing sessions. The group of twenty that Brandy and I worked withcontained everyone from a junior high school student who came with his dad, to a grandmother from SanFrancisco with purple hair and toenails, to a mid-30s couple who own an organic farm. We looked like six hundred overgrown children having a mid-morning slumber party on the day of the breathing sessions. After filling one of the hotel's large banquet halls with blankets, pillows, and softthings, the first set of breathers lay down in their nests while the sitters sat beside them. There would betwo identical three-hour sessions and each 'sitter-breather pair' would switch roles in the afternoon. Therole of the sitter is to assist the breather in a way that does not interfere with or interrupt the process.

The sitters stood vigil whiletheir partners journeyed into the spaceinside of their own minds. Dr. Grof andhis fellow facilitators watched over theroom, occasionally stopping to answerquestions or perform focused energy work onany breathers who were experiencing physical tension. My personal experience at the workshop left me feeling very calm. While breathing, I lost consciousnessseveral times and fell into a yogic sleep state. I wasdisappointed that I wasn't aware of my thoughts like I hadbeen in my previous experience with HolotropicBreathwork, when I had been barraged with rapid flashesof inspiration. Dr. Grof addressed this concern during hisspeech that night though, when he told us that the mostpowerful healing occurs in yogic sleep states. My sitting session, however, was incredible. I sat for Brandy, who was very calm and didn't require muchmaintenance as a breather except for occasionally askingfor water. This allowed me to disperse my attentionthroughout the room. I watched several people get up offof the floor and begin dancing. Others appeared to bereliving birth experiences. The thing that touched me themost was an elderly woman on the far side of the room.Towards the end of the session, she began screeching andsobbing above all of the other noise. \"No don't leave me!Why do you have to go?\" I watched Dr. Grof kneel at herside to comfort her. She continued crying as everyonebegan trickling out of the room for lunch and mandaladrawing. Tears came to my eyes as her screams penetratedmy ears. I began sobbing uncontrollably just as she was; Iwas feeling her pain become my own. Iglanced across the room and saw thatother people were experiencing thesame effect. After Brandy was finishedbreathing we left the room so that shecould draw her mandala. Dr. Grofstayed at the woman's side. After witnessing the incredible gentleness and compassion with whichhe worked on the individual level, thethree of us had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Grof thefollowing morning, and learn about his larger perspectiveon his career. Here is what he had to say. MAPS: Is this your last Breathwork workshop? Grof: It's very likely. I was planning to do more reading and writing, but I am still planning to do the retreats inNapa Valley. We also do one in Switzerland. MAPS: So how do you feel about doing one of your last Breathwork weekends? What were some of the high-lights? Grof: The very wonderful feeling about it is that so many people have been trained and will continue to work. Thatpart is very encouraging. Obviously, whenever a big era isending, there is always some sadness involved, a bit ofnostalgia. MAPS: Was there anything special about this weekend? Grof: Besides being the last one, it was certainly one of the larger groups. I really like the energy of the large groups. MAPS: What are your plans for the future, outside of Breathwork? Grof: Christina and I did the virtual reality consulting for a movie called Brainstorm in 1982. It is a very interestingscreenplay about two scientists who develop a helmet.When someone has an experience, the helmet can record it, and another person can wear the helmet and relive the experience. One of the two scientists is working late in thelaboratory, has a heart attack and records it. In themorning the other scientist comes in and sees her dead,and the tape is still rolling. They realized they hadrecorded the death experience. The director of the movie found us because he wanted to use the best special effects to portray the deathexperience. We were very excited about it, and we helped\"l believe that with the right kind of imagery, we could not just portray these altered states but induce them.\" - Dr. Grof \"lt would be a major turning point if the power of the media could be used in apositive way to dissipate the negativeattitudes of their audiences. \" - Dr. Grof 20 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1design the special effects. I believe that with the right kind of imagery, we could not just portray these altered statesbut induce them. I wrote a science fiction novel that Iwould like to turn into a screenplay so that I could portraytransformative and psychedelic experiences. My mostimmediate focus is reallyon science fiction featuremovies. There is not re-ally a great interest inacademic books amongAmerican audiences.Movies reach all levelsand have more culturalimpact. The critical in-terface is really the me-dia. The media still has adefensive attitude to-ward spiritual issues. Itwould be a major turn-ing point if the power of the media could be used in apositive way to dissipate the negative attitudes of theiraudiences. MAPS: How has your perspective on non-ordinary states changed over the years? Grof: I think that the significance of non-ordinary states was increasing as I was getting more deeply involved.Initially, there was the sense that they were anomalies. Iwas trying to explain it in the context of the existingtheories. Then I saw that there was a major challenge, and that to explain what people were experiencing would requiresome kind of radical revision to psychology and psychia-try. The concept of spiritual emergency came from it.Then I realized that it was not just a challenge forpsychology and psychiatry, but for the whole philosophyof Western science. It would radically change the wholeworldview of science. I think the last realization was that non-ordinary states would not only have major planetary significance,but I started seeing it as something, maybe the only thing,that could avert the global crisis. If enough people couldexperience the kind of psychospiritual change that we seeindividually, it could really make a difference in theworld. Even if people did not study ecology, or would justfocus on inner transformation during their sessions,automatically they would move to worldviews that in- clude greater ecological sensitivity, a reduction of hostil-ity, an increase of tolerance to racial, political, andcultural differences. It just automatically generates thekind of transformation that would make a difference in the world. The un-derstanding and re-spect for cycles,could help peoplesee the need for re-newable energy,the need not to cre-ate waste and cyclesrather binge\u2014the big-ger the better andso on. MAPS: What do you see in the future of psychedelic research? Grof: The situation is much better than when psychedelics first came. One reason is that the concept ofpsychotherapy at the time was lying on the couch andfree-associating. When there were strong emotions in-volved it was called acting out and it was something thatshould not happen. The kinds of things that were hap-pening in psychedelic sessions were seen as pathologies.Psychedelic states were called experimental psychoses. Inthat kind of situation it was very difficult to convey themessage that those sorts of things could be therapeutic.The second reason was that the experiences that we werehaving and seeing were not supposed to happen, theywere considered impossible. The medical communitydismissed it as nonsense. Today there is a very different situation. There is a great popularity of experiential therapies used to workwith intense emotions. For people involved in these typesof therapies, moving to psychedelics would not be a verybig step. Also beneficial is the development of the newparadigm of thinking, the philosophical implications ofquantum interruptions of physics, the Chaos Theory andso on. We have a completely different way of approachingthese experiences, a way to bridge to science, not main-stream science, but science. \"Then l saw that there was a major challenge, and that to explain whatpeople were experiencing wouldrequire some kind of radical revisionto psychology and psychiatry. \" - Dr. Grof \"There is a great popularity of experiential therapies used to work with intense emotions.\" - Dr. Grof21 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1MAPS: Do you think that more people are feeling the need for rituals in their lives? Grof: Throughout history all cultures absolutely inde- pendently have developed rituals, which obviously re-flects a very deep need in human beings. I think we arepaying a toll for having lost the rituals. Christina went toa conference in New York, convened by the NY statelegislature. They were very concerned about the younggeneration - sex and drugs and criminality. One mannoticed that there were many ritualistic elements in thebehavior of gangs. For example in some African tribes,when a boy comes of age they will send him out with aspear and when he comes back he will return with a lion.This is what makes him a man. In these NY gangs, if youwant to be a member, they give you a gun and you have toshoot somebody. If you are a girl, you have to have sexwith all the men in the group. He also noticed that whensomebody is killed in a street fight, there are veryelaborate rituals. Since they are missing mean-ingful rituals, they develop their own.He had this idea that we should createsome rites of passage for the youngergeneration. MAPS: Can you share a special psy- chedelic experience of your own? Grof: Well there's so many. . . After thinking about our interview with Dr. Grof, I realized that as young adults, we have been introduced tomind-altering substances by our peers. We have alsowatched our peers get arrested for possessing or sellingsome of those substances. Altered states of consciousness,for many young people in America, are rarely associatedwith growing up or enlightenment as they are in manymore \"primitive\" cultures, and are too often associatedwith sirens, drug-sniffing dogs, and the threat of jail.Drug-using youth are labeled as \"the wrong crowd\" byparents, teachers, and the other kids. Once a member ofthis group, it is only natural for the child to engage inother socially unacceptable behaviors - stealing, fighting,or skipping school. By being exposed to a legal route ofaltered consciousness such as Breathwork, perhaps theseyouth could explore themselves without the negativestereotype. While many parents and/or advocates of theWar on Drugs may cringe when they hear the words\"altered\" and \"consciousness\" in the same sentence, fewcould find the phrase \"breathing exercises\" objection-able. The three of us are fortunate to have experiencedaltered consciousness in such a loving and non-judgmen- tal environment during the time in our lives when we arepassing from youth to adulthood. Perhaps the solution toour culture's missing rites of passage can be found inHolotropic Breathwork. Maybe someday soon our cul-ture will embrace a ritual such as Holotropic Breathworkand it will be just as common as getting a driver's licensefor young people like Brandy, Jag, and I to go through asession upon entering adulthood. Our journey took us to explore a new realm of consciousness. For Stanislav Grof, the process of workingwith non-ordinary states of consciousness began overforty years ago. Stanislav Grof, M.D., was born andeducated in Czechoslovakia. Grof's early research in theclinical uses of psychoactive drugs was conducted at thePsychiatric Research Institute in Prague, where he wasPrincipal Investigator of a program systematically explor-ing the heuristic and therapeutic potential of LSD and other psychedelic substances. He came to the United States in 1967 to complete a fellowship at Johns HopkinsUniversity. He went on to become Chief of PsychiatricResearch at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center,Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Henry PhippsClinic of Johns Hopkins University, and Scholar-in-Residence at the Esalen Institute in California where hedeveloped the Holotropic Breathwork technique. He hassince founded the International Transpersonal Associa-tion where he has organized large international confer-ences and held countless workshops. Grof has publishedover 100 articles in professional journals and authoredseveral books, including LSD Psychotherapy, the new edition of which is now available from MAPS.

Editor's note: This remarkable dialogue from 1984 has never been published. We're printing it now in part to provide historical context for a new effort, in whichMAPS is participating, to restart LSD psychotherapy research in the United States. Inaddition, this dialogue addresses and helps clarify the idealist view of the potentialvalue of psychedelics, when used properly, to help \"engender ecologicalsensitivity, reverence for life, and capacity for peaceful cooperation with otherpeople and other species,\" qualities that are desperately needed in these times ofterrorism and war. Grof: It is a great pleasure and an honor for me this morning to welcome and introduce Dr. Albert Hofmann, to the extent to which he needs introduction at all. As you all know, he became world famous for his discovery of a compound that is probably the mostcontroversial substance ever developed by man, diethylamide of lysergic acid, or LSD-25.When LSD made its entry into the world of science, it became an overnight sensationbecause of its remarkable effects and also its unprecedented potency. It seemed to holdtremendous promise in the research of the nature and etiology of schizophrenia, as an extraordinary therapeutic agent, as a very unconventional tool for training of mental health professionals, and as a source of inspiration for artists. Dr. Hofmann's discovery of LSD generated a powerful wave of interest in brain chemistry and, together with the development of tranquilizers, was directly responsible forwhat has been called the \"golden age of psychopharmacology.\" And then his prodigiouschild became a \"problem child\". This extraordinarily promising chapter in psychology and psychiatry was drastically interrupted by unsupervised mass self-experimentation and the ensuing repressive administrative, legislative, and political measures, as well as thechromosome scare and the abuse by the military and secret police. But I firmly believe thatthis chapter is far from being closed. Whether or not LSD research and therapy as such willreturn into modern society, the discoveries that psychedelics made possible have profoundrevolutionary implications for our understanding of the psyche, human nature, and the nature of reality. And these new insights are here to stay as an important part of the emerging scientific world view of the future. Before we start this interview, I would like to add a little personal note. Dr. Hofmann's discovery of LSD and his work, in general, have had a profound impact on my ownprofessional and personal life, for which I am immensely grateful. My first LSD session in1956, when I was a beginning psychiatrist, was a critical landmark and turning point for me and since then my life has never been the same. So this interview gives me the opportunity to express my deep appreciation and gratitude to Dr. Hofmann for the influence he has hadon my life. What I would like to ask you first has something to do with the way people tend to qualify your discovery of the psychedelic effects of LSD. It is usually referred to as a pureaccident, implying that there was nothing more involved in this entire matter than your fortuitous intoxication. But I know from you that the history was somewhat more complex23 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 \"...the discoveries that psychedelics made possible haveprofound revolutionaryimplications for ourunderstanding of the psyche,human nature, and the nature ofreality.\" - S.G. than that. Can you clarify this for us? Hofmann: Yes, it is true that my discovery of LSD was a chance discovery, but it was the outcome of planned ex-periments and these experi-ments took place in theframework of systematicpharmaceutical, chemical research. It could better be described as serendipity. That means that you look forsomething, you have a certain plan, and then you findsomething else, different, that may nevertheless be useful. And that is exactly what happened with LSD. I had developed a method for the synthesis of lysergic acid amides in the context of a systematic study, the purpose of which was to synthesize natural ergot alkaloids. At thattime, in the 1930s, a new ergot alkaloid had been discovered which is named ergometrine, orergonovine. It is the realactive principle of ergot.The presence of this al-kaloid in ergot is the rea- son why it has been used in obstetrics to stop uter-ine bleeding and as anoxytoxic. And this sub- stance turned out to be an amide of lysergic acid. Until the late 1930s, it had not been possible to prepare such substances in the laboratory. I discovered a technical procedure that made it possible and was able toachieve partial synthesis of ergonovine; I then also usedthis procedure to prepare other lysergamides. First camethe modifications of ergonovine and one of these modifi-24 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1\"I got into a dreamlike condition, in which all of my surrounding wastransforming. My experience ofreality had changed and it was ratheragreeable.\" - A.H.cations, methergine, a homologue of ergonovine, is today the leading medicament in obstetrics to stop postpartumbleeding. I also used this procedure to prepare not so closederivatives of ergonovine, more different thanmethergine. And one of these compounds was LSD-25,lysergic acid diethylamide. The plan, the intention I had, was to prepare an analeptic, a circulatory and breathing stimulant. Grof: Was there some indication in the early animal experiments that LSD could be an activating agent? Hofmann: No, I made LSD because it is an analog of coramine, which is diethylamide of nicotinic acid. Be-cause of the structural relationship between LSD and the ring of the nicotinic acid, I hoped to get an analeptic. But our pharmacologist concluded that lysergic acid diethyla-mide did not have any clinically interesting propertiesand suggested that it be dropped out of research. Thathappened in the year 1938. But all along, I had a strange feeling that we should again test this substance on a broader scale. Then, five years later, in 1943, I finallydecided to synthesize another sample of LSD. At the endof the synthesis, something very strange happened. I gotinto a dreamlike condition, in which all of my surround-ing was transforming. My experience of reality had changed and it was rather agreeable. In any case, I left the laboratory, went home, lay down and enjoyed a nicedreamlike state which then passed away. Grof: Did you immediately suspect that this was an intoxication from the drug you were working with? Hofmann: I had the suspicion that it was caused by something from the laboratory, but I believed that itcould have been caused by the solvent I had used at thattime. I had used dichlorethylene, something like chloro-form, in the very final state of preparation. So, the next day in the laboratory, I tried the solvent and nothinghappened. Then I considered the possibility that it might have been the substance I had prepared. But it did not make any sense. I knew I was very careful and my work was very clean. And, of course, I did not taste anything. But I was open to the fact that, maybe, some trace of the substance had in some way passed into my body.That, maybe, a drop of the solution had come onto myfingertips and, when I rubbed my eyes, it got into the conjunctival sacs. But, if this compound was the reason for this strange experience I had, then it had tobe very, very active. That was clear from the verybeginning because I had not ingested anything. I waspuzzled and decided to conduct some experimentsto clear up this thing, to find out what was the reason for that extraordinary condition I had experienced. Being a cautious man, I started this experiment with only 0.25 milligrams (the ergot alkaloids are usually administered in milligram dosages). That is anextremely low dose and I expected it would not have anyactivity. I thought I would increase very cautiously the quantity of LSD in subsequent experiments to see if any of the dosages were active. It turned out that when Iingested this quarter of a milligram, I had taken a verystrong, a very high dosage of a very, very active com-pound. I got into a strange state of consciousness. Every-thing in my surroundings changed - the colors, the forms, and also the feeling of my ego had changed. It was very strange! And I became very anxious that I had taken toomuch and I asked my assistant to accompany me home.At that time we had no car available and we went home bybicycle. Grof: Many people who have taken LSD, particularly in such a high dose, have a lot of respect for that ride. Theyrealize what it is to ride a bicycle in that kind of acondition. Hofmann: During this trip home on the bicycle - it was about four kilometers - I had the feeling that I could not move from the spot. I was cycling, cycling, but the timeseemed to stand still. In my report afterward, I mentionedthis trip on the bicycle to show that LSD affected theexperience of time, as an example of the distortion of thesense of time. Then the bicycle trip became a characteris- tic aspect of the LSD discovery. As we arrived home, I was in a very, very bad condition. It was such a strange reality,such a strange new universe which I had entered, that Ibelieved I had now become insane. I asked my assistant to25 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 \"The reason for our success was that we used our own team for testing the fractions and did not rely on animal experiments.\" - A.H.\"I was cycling, cycling, but the time seemed to stand still.\" - A.H.call the doctor. When the doctor arrived, I told him that I was dying. I had the feeling that my body had absolutely no feeling any more. He tested me and shook his head, because everything was OK. Then, my condition became worse and worse. When I was lying on my couch, I had the feeling that I hadalready died. I believed, I had a sense that I was out of mybody. It was a terrifying experience! The doctor did not give me anything, but I drank a lot of milk, as an unspecific detoxicant. After about six hours, the experi-ence of the outer world started to change. I had the feelingof coming back from a very strange land, home to oureveryday reality. And it was a very, very happy feeling and a very beautiful experience. After some time, with my eyes closed, I began to enjoy this wonderful play of colors andforms, which it really was a pleasure to observe. Then I went to sleep and the next day I was fine. I felt quite fresh, like a newborn. It was an April day and I went out into thegarden. It had been raining during the night. I had thefeeling that I saw the earth and the beauty of nature as ithad been when it was created, at the first day of creation.It was a beautiful experience! I was reborn, seeing nature in quite a new light. Grof: We have seen this kind of sequence, the death- rebirth process, very regularly in psychedelic sessions.Many people link this experience to the memory of theirbiological birth. I wanted to ask you, if during the time when it was happening, it was just an encounter with death or if you also had the feeling that you were involvedin a biological birthing process? Hofmann: No, the first phase was a very terrifying experience, because I did not know if I would recover. First, I had the feeling that I was insane and then I had the feeling I was dying. But then, when I was coming back, Ihad of course the feeling of rebirth. Grof: When did you become aware that this drug could be of significance to psychiatry? Hofmann: Immediately! I knew immediately that this drug would have importance for psychiatry! But, at thattime, I would never have believed that this substancecould be used in the drug scene, just for pleasure. For me it was a deep and mystical experience and not just an everyday pleasurable one. I never had the idea that it could be used as a pleasure drug. And then, soon after myexperience, LSD came into the hands of psychiatrists.The son of my boss at that time, Dr. Werner Stoll, whowas working at the Burghoeltzli Psychiatric Institute inZurich, conducted the initial experiments with LSD. First, we checked it in our laboratory, because the head of the Chemical Department, Professor Stoll, andthe head of the Pharmacology Department, ProfessorRothlin, said that what I was telling them was notpossible. They told me: \"You must have made a mistakewhen you measured the dosage. It is impossible that such a low dosage could have an effect.\" And Professor Rothlin then made an experiment with two of his assistants. Theytook only one fifth of what I had taken, 50 micrograms, to check it out. And even then, they had a full-blown experience! Grof: So, this was, in a nutshell, the story of the discov- ery of LSD. And then we come to the next importantchapter of your psychedelic research, the isolation and identification of the active principles of the magic mushrooms of the Mazatec Indians in Mexico. Howlong after the discovery of the psychedelic effects ofLSD did Gordon Wasson contact you? Hofmann: For the first ten years, LSD was my \"wonder child\", we had a positive reaction from everywhere in the world. Around two thousand publications about it ap-peared in scientific journals and everything was fine.Then, at the beginning of the 1960s, here in the UnitedStates, LSD became a drug of abuse. In a short time, thiswave of popular use swept the country and it became \"drug number one\". It was then used without caution26 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 \"We explained to Maria Sabina that we had isolated the spirit ofthe mushrooms and that it wasnow in these little pills. She wasfascinated and agreed to make aceremony for us.\"- A.H.\"..I saw the earth and the beauty of nature as it hadbeen when it was created, atthe first day of creation. Itwas a beautiful experience!I was reborn, seeing naturein quite a new light.\" - A.H. and people were not prepared and informed about its deep effects. And then all kinds of things happened, which caused LSD to become an infamous drug. It was a troublesome time! Telephones,panic, and alarm! This had hap-pened, that had happened.... itwas a breakdown. Instead of a\"wonder child\", LSD suddenly became my \"problem child\". I saw in the newspaper a notice that an American ama-teur mycologist and ethnologist,Gordon Wasson, and his wifehad discovered mushrooms which were used in a ritual way by the Indians. These mushrooms seemed to contain ahallucinogen that produced an LSD-like effect. Ofcourse, I did not know who these ethnologists were, but Icertainly was interested in investigating these mush-rooms. Then, I got a letter from Professor Heim, a French mycologist from the Sorbonne in Paris. Mr. Wasson and his wife, who had discovered this very old Mexicanmushroom cult and had published information aboutthe ritual use of these mushrooms, had sent him somesamples. They had asked him if he could examine themushrooms and make a precise botanical investigation. Professor Heim tried to isolate the active principle from the mushrooms, but did not succeed. GordonWasson had also initiated chemical studies of the mush-rooms in the United States, at the University of Dela-ware, but this work had not brought any positive resultseither. And so Professor Heim, who knew about the work we had done with LSD in Basel, asked me in his letter if I would be interested in taking on this research. So, in thisway, LSD attracted the mushrooms to come into mylaboratory.At first, we had only 200 or 300 grams of these mushrooms. We tested them in animals, since we had some experience with LSD and we knew what kind of pharmacological activity couldbe expected from such psychoac-tive principles. We did not findanything and our pharmacolo-gist suggested that the mush- rooms probably were not active at all, that they were the wrongmushrooms, or that they had losttheir activity when they had beendried in Paris. In any case, to clearthe problem, I decided to make a self-experiment. I took a dosage that was mentioned in the prescriptions in the oldchronicles - 2.4 grams of dried mushrooms - and I had afull-blown LSD experience. And it was very strange. I took it in the laboratory and I had to go home, because I had again taken a dosage that was rather high. At home, everything looked Mexican - the rooms and surroundings - although I had never beenin Mexico before. I thought that I must have imagined allthat, because I knew that the mushrooms had come fromMexico. For example, I had a colleague, a doctor whosupervised me for this experiment. When he checked my blood pressure, I saw him as an Aztec. He had a German face, but for me he became an Aztec priest and I had thefeeling he would open my chest and take out my heart. Itwas really an absolutely Mexican experience! After a few hours, I came back from the Mexican landscape and I knew that we had not used the right tests. The work with animals would not have taken us any- where; we had to test the activity (of the various amounts)in humans. And from then on, my colleagues and I testedpersonally all the extracts we made from the mushrooms.We extracted them with different solvents and usedfractionating procedures to isolate the active principles. Grof: How many steps did it take you from the beginning to the end to identify chemically the active principles? Hofmann: We had about five or six steps. Finally, we ended up with a very small quantity, several milligrams of concentrated material that was still amorphous. And we could use it to make a paper chromatogram. It turned outthat the substance was concentrated in four phases. Wecut the paper chromatogram and four of my colleagues27 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1and I ate these fractions. When one turned out to be active, then we could make some tests with this fraction, crystallize it, get the color reaction specific for it, and so on. Finally, we were able to isolate the active principlesand it turned out to be two substances, which I namedpsilocybin and psilocin because they had been isolatedfrom Psilocybe mexicana. Most of these magic mush-rooms used by the Indians belong to the genus Psilocybe. Then, when we had these substances, we sent them for pharmacological testing. It turned out that they wereabout a hundred times less active than LSD, but still veryactive. It means that about 5 to 10 milligrams is the activedose. Later I received a let-ter from Professor Moore in Delaware, who con- gratulated us for solvingthe problem of the mush-rooms. He and his teamhad worked for more thana year trying to isolate the active principles from these mushrooms andwere not able to do it. Theyhad tested all their extractsin animals, all kinds of ani-mals, even fish, but were not able to find a lead. The reason for our success was that we used our own team fortesting the fractions and did not rely on animal experi-ments. Professor Moore then sent me the rest of thesemushrooms; after all this work, he still had about 12kilograms left. Grof: What was the overall time that it took you to identify the active alkaloids? Hofmann: About half a year. Having chemically identi- fied these substances, we were then able to synthesize them in the laboratory. We were able to use the basic materials we had on hand from the LSD research, namelyderivatives of tryptamine which could now be used forthe synthesis of psilocybin, and psilocin. GordonWasson, who was a banker by profession and an amateurmycologist, was very impressed by the results. He did not know what active principles meant; for him it was the mushrooms that were the active agent. He came to Baselto visit us and I showed him these active principles in apure crystalline form. It turned out that only about 0.5%of the mushrooms represents the active principles. In- stead of 5 grams of the mushrooms you can take 25 milligrams of psilocybin. Gordon was quite fascinated to see these crystals and then he said: \"Oh, by the way, thereis another magic drug the Indians use which has not yetbeen studied scientifically. It is called ololiuqui. Grof: And so began another important chapter of your research. Hofmann: Yes. I went with Gordon Wasson to Mexico to study the other magic plant materials, ololiuqui (morning glory seeds) and Salviadivinorum, a new Salvia spe- cies that the Indians also used like the mushrooms. We vis-ited Maria Sabina, thecurandera or the shamanwoman who had given themushrooms to the Wassons. They were probably the first white people who ever ingestedthe mushrooms during the sa-cred ceremony. It was alreadylate summer or beginning offall and there were no more mushrooms. We explained to Maria Sabina that we had isolated the spirit of themushrooms and that it was now in these little pills. Shewas fascinated and agreed to make a ceremony for us. To participate in the ceremony, you always have to have a reason. The mushroom ceremony is a consulta- tion, like going to a doctor or a psychiatrist if you have some problems. Gordon told Maria Sabina: \"I left NewYork three weeks ago and my daughter had to go to thehospital to have a child. I don't know what happened withher. Can the mushroom tell me what happened with mydaughter?\" So that was the reason they made a ceremony for us. It involved Maria Sabina, her daughters, and other shaman colleagues and it was a beautiful ceremony. Grof: I understand that, on this occasion, Maria Sabina gave you the official \"seal of approval,\" that after havingtaken the pills, she actually confirmed that their effects were identical to those of the magic mushrooms. Hofmann: Yes. I gave her for the ceremony tablets of the synthetic psilocybin. I knew that she used a certain \"I started with the lysergic acid amides Mymagic circle!\" - A.H.28 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1number of mush- rooms and I as- sessed tablets. Weused them and itwas really a full-blown wonderful ceremony which lasted until the morning. When we left, Maria Sabinatold us that these tablets really contained the spirit of themushrooms. I gave her a bottle of them and she said: \"Ican now also perform the ceremonies during the timeswhen we have no more mushrooms.\" Grof: How did you now move from your mushroom research to the work with ololiuqui? Hofmann: I got the supply of ololiuqui, seeds of a certain morning glory family, from Gordon Wasson. Gordon got them from a Zapotec Indian who had collected them for him. These seeds, like the mushrooms, were used inceremonies for a kind of magic healing and for divination.We were able to isolate the active principles responsiblefor the effect of these seeds and I was quite astonished tofind out that these seeds contained as the active principles monoamid and hydroxyethylamid of lysergic acid and a bit of ergonovine. These were derivatives of lysergic acidwhich I had on my shelf through my studies with LSD. Iinitially could not believe that this was possible, becausethe lysergic acid derivatives I had worked with beforewere produced by a fungus. Grof: And the morning glory seeds come from flowering plants that belong botanically to an entirely differentcategory. Hofmann: Yes, these plants belong to two very different stages of evolution in the plant kingdom, which are quite remote from each other. And it is absolutely unusual tofind the same chemical products in quite different stagesof plant evolution. Grof: I have heard that, at the beginning, your colleagues actually accused you, saying that you must have contami- nated your samples from the ololiuqui research with theproducts of your LSD work that you kept in yourlaboratory. Knowing how meticulous your work is, thatwas quite an outra- geous accusation! Hofmann: That is true. I gave the on this workin 1960, at the In-ternational Confer- ence on Natural Products in Sydney. When I presented my results, mycolleagues shook their heads and said: \"It is impossiblethat you find the same active principles in a quite differentsection of the plant kingdom. You are working with allkinds of lysergic acid derivatives; you must have mixed up something and that is the reason.\" But finally, of course, they checked it and confirmed our results. That was the closing of a kind of magic circle. I started with the lysergic acid amides - methergine and LSD - andLSD attracted the mushrooms. The mushrooms thenbrought the ololiuqui and the work with ololiuqui took me back to lysergic acid amides. My magic circle! Grof: Have you actually tried the ololiuqui yourself? Hofmann: Yes, I did. But, of course, it is about ten times less active; to get a good effect, you need one to two milligrams. Grof: And what was that experience like? Hofmann: The experience had some strong narcotic effect, but at the same time there was a very strange sense of voidness. In this Void, everything loses its meaning. It is a very mystical experience. Grof: Usually, when you read the psychedelic literature there is a distinction being made between the so-callednatural psychedelics, such as psilocybin, psilocin, mesca- line, harmaline, or ibogaine, which are produced by various plants (and this applies even more to psychedelicplants themselves) and synthetic psychedelics that areartificially produced in the laboratory. And LSD, whichis semi-synthetic and thus a substance that was producedin the laboratory, is usually included among the latter. I understand that you have a very different feeling about it. Hofmann: Yes. When I discovered lysergic acid amides in ololiuqui, I realized that LSD is really just a small\"...this possibility to change reality, which exists in everyone, represents the realfreedom of every human individual. He hasan enormous possibility to change his worldview.\" - A.H.29 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 \"When I discovered lysergic acid amides in ololiuqui, I realized that LSD is reallyjust a small chemical modification of avery old sacred drug of Mexico.\" - A.H.chemical modification of a very old sacred drug of Mexico. LSD belongs, therefore, by its chemical structure and by its activity, in the group of the magic plants of Mesoamerica. It does not occur in nature assuch, but it represents just a small chemical variation ofnatural material. Therefore, it belongs to this group as achemical and also, of course, because of its effect and itsspiritual potential. The use of LSD in the drug scene can thus be seen as a profanation of a sacred substance. And this profanation is the reason that LSD has not had beneficial effects in the drug scene. In many in-stances, it actually produced terrifying and deleteriouseffects instead of beneficial effects, because of misuse,because it was a profanation. It should have been sub- jected to the same taboos and the same reverence the Indians had toward these substances. If that approachhad been transferredto LSD, LSD wouldnever have had such abad reputation. Grof: Let me move to another subject. Canyou tell us somethingabout the attempts to isolate the active alkaloids fromSalvia divinorum? Hofmann: Yes. When I was in Mexico, we also encoun- tered another plant that the Indians used ritually, likeololiuqui or like the mushrooms. It was a member of theSalvia species which had not been botanically identified.After a long trip into Sierra Mazateca, we finally found a curandera who conducted a ceremony with this plant and we had the opportunity to have an experience with it.Gordon Wasson, my wife, and myself ingested the juiceof fresh leaves and experienced some effects, but it wasvery mild. It was a clear-cut effect, but different from themushrooms. Grof: Have you attempted the isolation and chemical identification of the active principle from Salviadivinorum? Hofmann: I took the leaves and made extracts from them by pressing out the juice. I took this extract to Basel to my laboratory and wanted to chemically analyze it, but it wasno longer active. It seems that the active principle is veryeasily destroyed and the problem of chemical analysis isnot yet solved. But we were able to establish the botanical identity of this plant. It was determined at the Botanical Department at Harvard that it was a new species of Salvia and it got the name Salvia divinorum. It is a wrong name,bad Latin; it should be actually Salvia divinatorum. Theydo not know very good Latin, these botanists. I was notvery happy with the name because Salvia divinorummeans \"Salvia of the ghosts\", whereas Salvia divinatorum, the correct name, means \"Salvia of the priests\", But it is now in the botanical literature under the name Salviadivinorum. Grof: Was it Dr. Richard Schultes at Harvard who identified the plant? Hofmann: No, it was done in the same Institute, but by two other botanists;they were the oneswho gave it thename. Grof: Was this the end of your researchof psychedelic sub- stances? Have you been interested since then in any otherpsychedelic plants? And have you made any more at- tempts at identifying some of their active principles? Hofmann: No. No more. Grof: Was this work interrupted because of the political and administrative problems at Sandoz caused by the unsupervised use? Do you think you would have other- wise continued in this work? And would you have liked tocarry on? Hofmann: Yes, I have already said that the abuse and misuse in the drug scene brought many troubles to our company. Then came the legal restrictions from the health authorities in nearly all countries and, of course,management of our company was no longer interested inpursuing this avenue of research. Grof: I would like to ask you now about another project, your work with Gordon Wasson concerning the Myster- ies of Eleusis. In your book The Road to Eleusis , you suggest the possibility that it was a psychedelic cult thatactually existed and practiced for almost 2000 years, from30 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 11400 BC to 400 AD. And even then people did not just lose interest in it, but it was terminated by an edict of the Christian emperor Theodosius who prohibited and sup- pressed all pagan ceremonies. Hofmann: In professional circles of Greek scholars, it is absolutely clear that the ancient Greeks used some psy-choactive substance in their cult. There exist many references to a sacred beverage, kykeon, that was admin- istered to the initiates after preparations which took oneweek. After the adepts got this potion, they had, alltogether, powerful mystic experiences that they were notallowed to talk about and describe exactly. I had worked about twenty years ago with the Greek scholar, Professor Kerenyi, on this problem. The interesting question is: what were really the ingredients of this kykeon, this sacred potion? We hadstudied many plants that Professor Kerenyi had sug- gested as possible candidates, but they were not at all psychedelic. Then came Gordon Wasson with his hy-pothesis; naturally, it involved mushrooms, because hesaw mushrooms everywhere! He asked me, if the men inGreek antiquity had the possibility to prepare a psyche-delic potion from ergot. He came to this idea, because the Mysteries of Eleusis were founded by the Goddess Demeter and Demeter is the goddess of grain and ergot(Mutterkorn). That gave him the idea that ergot could beinvolved in the preparation of kykeon. I had all the materials at hand because, as part of our studies of ergot, we had collected all the literature and also many samples of ergot from all around the world. This included the ergot that was growing in the Mediterraneanbasin, in Greece, and so on. One or two of these wildergots growing on grasses can also be found in rye fields orin barley fields. Rye did not exist in antiquity, but barleydid, and in barley fields you can find certain wild ergots. We had found and analyzed all this ergot before Gordon asked me his question and in one species growingon wild grass (Paspalum) we had found exactly the samecomponents as in ololiuqui. Its main components werelysergic acid also lysergic I had no difficulty answering Gordon's question: Man in antiquity had the possibility to prepare a psyche- delic potion from ergot. He had to just collect the ergot,grind it, and put it into the kykeon. Gordon, pursuing the problem of kykeon, addressed not only me, as a chemist, but also a Greek scholarProfessor Carl Ruck at Harvard, who was a specialist on the role of medicinal plants in Greek mythology and Greek history. Professor Ruck was able to direct Gordonto some allusions in the Hymn to Demeter that provided support for his hypothesis. These passages mentioned that, indeed, there wassome kind of ergot which was used to make this kykeon psychedelic. Andthe three of us then co-authored a book, which ex-plored this evidence. Grof: That was the book The Road to Eleusis ? Hofmann: Yes, that was The Road to Eleusis, which was published here in the United States and also came out insome other languages, such as Spanish and German. Grof: You describe in this book that you actually did a self-experiment with one of the natural ergot alkaloids totest this hypothesis, to see if it was psychedelic. Was itergonovine? Hofmann: Yes, we had found active principles in this ergot which grows in Greece. It contained lysergic acid amide and hydroxyethylamide, about which it was al-ready known that they were psychedelic. But it was notknown if ergonovine had some psychedelic effects and Iwas interested to find out. Ergonovine had been usedalready for many decades in obstetrics without any reports that it had been psychedelic. But the dosage which is injected to women in childbirth, is only 0.5 mgand 0.25 mg. I tested it up to 2 mg and, in that dosage, ithad clearly psychedelic effects. It had not been discoveredearlier, because when it is administered, women are just atthe end of the process of delivery. They are thus in a state in which they are not very good observers and, in addition, the dosage is too low to produce psychedeliceffects. Methergine and ergonovine also produce psyche-\"What could possibly have been so powerful and interesting that it kept the attention of the ancientworld for almost two thousand years withoutinterruption?\" - S.G.31 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1\"The enormous effect that the death/ rebirth mysteries of various kinds musthave had on the Greek culture, which isgenerally considered the cradle ofEuropean civilization, must be the bestkept secret in human history.\" - S.G.delic effects but in higher doses. Grof: It is a very in- teresting hypothesis,because it gives a plausible answer to the intriguing ques-tion: What was it thatwas being offered atEleusis? What couldpossibly have been so powerful and interesting that it kept the attention of the ancient world for almost two thou- sand years without interruption? And that it attracted somany exceptional and illustrious people? Also the factthat it was such a strongly guarded secret - the punish-ment for revealing the secret of the mysteries was death -suggests that something quite extraordinary, something extremely important was happening there. Hofmann: It was a very important spiritual center for nearly 2000 years. All we have to do is to look at all thefamous people, who for thousands of years in the world ofantiquity, in the Roman and Greek world, were intro- duced to the Mysteries of Eleusis. For us it was a very interesting problem to find out what the initiates reallyingested. There were two families in Eleusis who knewthe secret of the kykeon, two generations of families whoconserved the secret. Grof: One often hears that the use of psychedelic materi- als is alien to the Western culture, that it is something thatis practiced in pre-literate human groups, in \"primitive\"societies. The enormous effect that the death/rebirthmysteries of various kinds must have had on the Greek culture, which is generally considered the cradle of Euro- pean civilization, must be the best kept secret in humanhistory. Many of the great figures of antiquity, such asphilosophers Plato, Aristotle, and Epictetus, the play-wright Euripides, military leader Alkibiades, Romanstatesman and lawyer Cicero, and others were initiates of these mysteries, whether it was the Eleusinian variety or some other forms - the Dionysian rites, the mysteries ofAttis and Adonis, Mithraic or Korybantic mysteries, andthe Orphic cult. Hofmann: It shows again that in old times, and also in our time among the Indian tribes, psychedelic substanceswere considered sacred and theywere used with the right attitude and in a ritual andspiritual context. What a difference if we compare it with the careless and irresponsible use of LSD in the streets and in the discotheques of New York City andeverywhere in the West. It is a tragic misunderstanding ofthe nature and the meaning of these kinds of substances. Grof: I would now like to move away from these cultural and historical explorations and go back to chemistry.Although pharmacology is not your primary interest, Iwould like to ask you a question about the mechanism ofthe action of LSD. There does not seem to be unanimityas to why LSD is psychoactive and there are several competing hypotheses about it. Do you have any ideas in this regard? Hofmann: We have done some research that is related to this question. We labeled LSD with radioactive carbon,C14. That makes it possible to follow its metabolic fate in the organism. Strangely enough, we found, of course in animals, that 90% of the LSD is excreted very quickly andonly 10% of it goes into the brain. And in the brain it goesinto the hypothalamus and that is where the emotionalfunctions are located. This corresponds also to the factthat it is primarily the emotional sphere that is stimulated by LSD. The rational spheres are rather inhibited. And, of course, it is not LSD that produces these deep psychic changes. The action of LSD can be understoodonly in terms of its interaction with the chemical pro-cesses in the brain which underlie the psychic functions.Since LSD is a substance, its action can be described only in terms of interaction with other substances and with the structures in the brain, the receptors, and so on. One of the popular hypotheses was, for example, the 'serotonin hypothesis' of the British researchers Woolleyand Shaw. It was found that LSD is a very specific andstrong inhibitor of serotonin in some biological systems. And since serotonin plays a very important role in the chemistry of neurophysiological functions in the brain,this was seen as the mechanism underlying its psychologi-32 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1cal effects. Since this antagonism between LSD and serotonin was very strong and specific, our pharmacologist was very interested to find out, if there are serotonin antagonistswithout hallucinogenic effect. This was not only aninteresting theoretical question, but a matter of somepractical interest, because serotonin is involved in themechanism of migraine headaches and in infor- mation processes. A serotonin antagonist without psy- chedelic effects could be used as a medicament. Grof: This was the reason why 2-brominated antagonist without psychedelic Hofmann: We made all kinds of LSD derivatives. Also among them was the 2-brominated LSD, which turnedout to have strong anti-serotonin effect, but without anypsychedelic effects. After that finding, the 'serotoninhypothesis' could not be sustained any more. Another problem was that the serotonin antagonism is not studied in the brain, but on peripheral biological preparations. Grof: Then there is, of course, the complex question of the blood/brain barrier; which of the substances thatshow peripheral antagonism are actually allowed to enterthe brain? Hofmann: Yes. LSD also has effects on other transmit- ters, such as dopamine and adrenaline and it is verycomplicated. For this reason, LSD was a very useful andinfluential tool in brain research and has remained thatuntil this very day. Grof: I am very interested in one particular hypothesis concerning the effects of LSD. It was formulated by Dr.Harold Abramson and his team in New York City. Onthe basis of some animal experiments, particularly with the Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), they came to the conclusion that the most relevant aspect of the LSD effect involves the enzymatic transfer of oxygen on thesubcellular level. For me this was interesting, because itcould account for the similarity between the LSD effectsand the experiences associated with the process of dying.And there might also be connections to the effects of the holotropic breathwork that my wife Christina and I have developed. Unfortunately, it seems that this researchremained limited to that one paper; I have not seen anyadditional supportive evidence for this hypothesis. Hofmann: There was another hypothesis, where the emphasis was, I believe, on the effect of LSD on the degradation of adrenaline and noradrenaline leading toabnormal oxidation products (Hoffer and Osmond'sadrenochrome and adrenolutine hypothesis). But noneof this has been confirmed and the question of theeffective mechanisms of LSD is still open. In addition, it is important to realize that there is an enormous leap from chemistry to psychological experi-ence. There are limits to what thisbasic chemical background can tell usabout consciousness. Grof: If I understand you correctly, you feel, very much like I do myself,that even if we could explain all thebiochemical and neurophysiologicalchanges in the neurons, we are stillconfronted with this quantum leap from biochemical and electrical processes to conscious- ness that seems unbridgeable. Hofmann: Yes, it is the basic problem of reality. We can study various psychic functions and also the more primi-tive sensory functions, such as seeing, hearing, and so on, which constitute our image of our everyday world. They have a material side and the psychic side. And that is a gapwhich you cannot explain. We can follow the metabolismin the brain, we can measure the biochemical and neuro-physiological changes, electric potentials, and so on.These are material and energetic processes. But matter and electric current are quite a different thing, quite a different level, than the psychic experience. Even ourseeing and other sensory functions already involve thesame problem. We must realize that there is a gap which \"We can study material processes and various processes at the energetic level, that is whatwe can do as natural scientists. And thenthere comes something quite different, thepsychic experience, which remains amystery.\" - A.H.33 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1probably can never be overcome or be explained. We can study material processes and various processes at the energetic level, that is what we can do as natural scientists. And then there comes something quite different, thepsychic experience, which remains a mystery. Grof: There seem to be two radically different approaches to the problem of brain/consciousness relationship as it manifests in psychedelic sessions. The first one is the traditional scientific approach that explains the spectrumof the LSD experience as a release of information that isstored in the repositories of our brain. It suggests that theentire process is con-tained inside of our cra- nium and the experiences are created by combina-tions and interactions ofengrams that have accu-mulated in our memorybanks in this lifetime. A radical alternative to this monistic materialistic view was suggested byAldous Huxley. After some personal experiences withLSD and mescaline, he started seeing the brain more likea \"reducing valve,\" that normally protects us against a vastcosmic input of information, which would otherwise flood and overload our everyday consciousness. In this view, the function of the brain is to reduce all the availableinformation and lock us into a limited experience of theworld. In this view, LSD frees us from this restriction andopens us to a much larger experience. Hofmann: I agree with this model of Huxley's that in psychedelic sessions the function of the brain is opened.In general, we have limited capacity to transform all thestimuli which we receive from the outer world in the formof optical, acoustic, and tactile stimuli, and so on. Wehave a limited capacity to transfer this information so that it can come into consciousness. Under the influence of psychedelic substances, the valve is opened and an enor-mous input of outer stimuli can now come in andstimulate our brain. This then gives rise to this over-whelming experience. Grof: Have you actually personally met Aldous Huxley? Hofmann: Yes, I have met him two times and we had very good, very important discussions. He gave me his bookIsland, which had come out just before he died. In it he describes an old culture on an island, which is trying to make a synthesis between its own spiritual tradition and modern technology brought in by an American. Thisculture used ritually something called moksha medicineand moksha was a mushroom that brought enlighten-ment. Moksha was given only three times in the lifetimeof each individual. The first time it was during the initiation in a puberty rite, the second time in the middle of life, and the third time at death, in the final stage of life.And when Aldous gave me his book, he wrote: Hofmann, original discoverer of the I am veryproud to have this book, Island; it is a beautiful book. Grof: It is interest- ing that AldousHuxley actually used LSD to ease his tran- sition at the time of his death. Hofmann: Yes, after he had died, his widow sent me a copy of a paper. When he was in the process of dying (hewas unable to talk because of his cancer of the tongue), he wrote on it: \"0.1 milligrams of LSD, subcutaneously.\" So his wife gave him the injection of the moksha medicine. Grof: There is a beautiful description of this situation in her book which is called This Timeless Moment. Hofmann: Yes, This Timeless Moment, by Laura Huxley. Grof: I would like to ask you now something very personal. You must have been asked this question anumber of times before, I am sure. You have had duringyour lifetime quite a few psychedelic experiences, some of which you described to us today. It began with the LSD experiences associated with the discovery of LSD, thenthe experiences during the work on the isolation of theactive principles from the magic mushrooms and ololiu-qui, the experience in the mushroom ritual with MariaSabina, the sessions you described in LSD, My Problem Child, and some others. What influence have all these experiences had on you, on your way of being in theworld, on your values, on your personal philosophy, andon your scientific world view? \"Because, what is sacred if not the consciousness of the human being, andsomething which activates it must behandled with reverence and withextreme caution.\" - A.H.34 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1Hofmann: They have changed my life, insofar as they provided me with a new concept about what reality is.Reality became for me a problem after my experience with LSD. Before, I had believed there was only one reality, thereality of ev-eryday life.Just one truereality and the rest was tered intorealitieswhich wereas real andeven real than the one of every-day. And Ithoughtabout thenature of re- ality and I got some deeper insights. I analyzed the mechanisms involved in the produc- tion of the normal world view that we call the \"everydayreality.\" What are the factors that constitute it? What isinside and what is outside? What comes from the outside in and what is just inside? I use for this process the metaphor of the sender and the receiver. The productivesender is the outer world, the external reality includingour own body. The receiver is our deep self, the consciousego, which then transforms the outer stimuli into apsychological experience. It was very helpful for me to see what is really, objectively, outside; something that you cannot change,something that is the same for everybody. And what isproduced by me, homemade, what is myself, that whichI can change. What is my spiritual inside that can bechanged. This possibility to change reality, which exists in everyone, represents the real freedom of every human individual. He has an enormous possibility to change hisworld view. It helped me enormously in my life to realizewhat really exists on the outside and what is homemade by me. Grof: You have a tremendous awareness and sensitivity in regard toecological is-sues, for ex-ample, the industrial pollution ofwater and the interconnectedness of creation? Do you think thatthese experiences somehow opened you to this greaterecological awareness, to a sharper sense of what we aredoing to nature? Hofmann: Yes, through my LSD experience and my new picture of reality, I became aware of the wonder ofcreation, the magnificence of nature and of the animaland plant kingdom. I became very sensitive to what willhappen to all this and all of us. I have published andlectured about the main environmental problems we have in Europe and at home in this regard. Grof: The discovery of LSD has been such an important part of your life and you have also personally experiencedwhat a positive impact this substance can have on us if itis properly used. I would like to ask you: what was your reaction to what happened in the 1960s in the United States? Hofmann: Well, I was very sorry, really sorry. As I said, I \"They [psychedelics] are spiritual tools. If they are properly used, they open spiritualawareness. They also engender ecologicalsensitivity, reverence for life, and capacity forpeaceful cooperation with other people andother species. I think, in the kind of world wehave today, transformation of humanity inthis direction might well be our only realhope for survival. I believe that it is essentialfor our planetary future to develop tools thatcan change the consciousness which hascreated the crisis that we are in.\" - S.G.35 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1would have never suspected LSD could be misused in such a way. Now I have the feeling that the situation has improved, because you never read in the newspapers about accidents with LSD any more, as it happened in the1960s practically every day. People who use LSD todayknow how to use it. Therefore, I hope that the healthauthorities will get the insight that LSD, if it is usedproperly, is not a dangerous drug. We actually should not refer to it as drug; this word has a very bad connotation. We should use another name. Psychedelic substances, ifthey are used in proper ways, are very helpful for man-kind. Grof: You wrote a book entitled LSD, My Problem Child. I heard you say, at the conference, that you hope you might see the day when your problem child will becomea desired child again. Hofmann: I myself will not probably see this day, but it will definitely happen sometime in the future, I am sure. The truth will finally come out and the truth is: If LSD is used in the right way, it is a very important and very usefulagent. LSD is no longer playing a bad role in the drugscene and psychiatrists are again trying to submit theirproposals for research with this substance to the healthauthorities. I hope that LSD will again become available in the normal way, for the medical profession. Then it could play the role it really should, a beneficial role. Grof: Do you have a vision for the future concerning this, an idea of how you would like LSD to be used? Hofmann: We have a kind of model for it in Eleusis and also in the so-called primitive societies where psychedelicsubstances are used. LSD should be treated as a sacreddrug and receive corresponding preparation, preparationof quite a different kind than other psychotropic agents.It is one kind of thing if you have a pain-relieving substance or some euphoriant and (another to) have an agent that engages the very essence of human beings, theirconsciousness. Our very essence is Absolute Conscious-ness; without an I, without the consciousness of everyindividual, nothing really exists. And this very center, thiscore of the human being is influenced by these kinds of substances. Therefore, excuse me for repeating myself, these are sacred substances. Because, what is sacred if notthe consciousness of the human being, and somethingwhich activates it must be handled with reverence andwith extreme caution. Grof: Many of us who have experienced psychedelics feel very much, like you do, that they are sacred tools and that,if they are properly used, they open spiritual awareness.They also engender ecological sensitivity, reverence forlife, and capacity for peaceful cooperation with otherpeople and other species. I think, in the kind of world we have today, transformation of humanity in this direction might well be our only real hope for survival. I believe thatit is essential for our planetary future to develop tools thatcan change the consciousness which has created the crisisthat we are in. Hofmann: That certainly would be a major step in the right direction. We need a new concept of reality and anew set of values for things to change in a positivedirection. LSD could help to generate such a new con-cept. Grof: I would like to thank you for giving up your time of leisure on this beautiful day and for coming here to bewith us and share your life experiences. I really appreciateit very much and, I am sure, so does everyone else in thisroom. Hofmann: Thank you for inviting me to Esalen. I really enjoy this very beautiful landscape. It is so wonderful tobe here and to experience the atmosphere in this institutewith old friends and colleagues. It has been a greatexperience for me. Thank you, too. \"Psychedelic substances, if they are used in proper ways, are very helpful for mankind.\"36 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 he last twenty years of the last millennium I've lived largely in Catholic monasteries secretly using the sacred psychedelic, LSD-25, as part of my private spiritual practice. One could also say that as part of my sacred psychedelic practice, I used the monastic spiritual traditions. Either way, the fact is, thecombination brings to light the best in both, and in truth, that best is the same in each one. Now, as I look at that picture of the interior of the church that the monks themselves built at the monastery of Our Lady of the Holy Spirit, and I reflect on some of the more than one hundred-fifty beautiful, planned,sacred, psychedelic sessions that I enjoyed in and around that church and the monk mind-field, I'd like to order up a whole googlplex of sacred \"flashbacks\". I arrived at the monastery in 1980, at the end of a two week fast, no food and minimal water. Before eating, I took some of the sacred psychedelic and surveyed the situation. Among other things, I realized that Trappist monasticism warranted some in-depth spiritual exploration and psychedelic evaluation, giving it the acid test. I wanted to see and hear everything so I got high for everything except work. As I worked primarily in thestained glass studio, I think that was prudent. Chanting in choir is a duty that is remarkably elevating, to say the least, and would leave me wishing it would go on for hours. I usually timed my psychedelic sessions to start in the evening, so that I would still behigh, but not too high, when I got to my choir stall at 4:00 AM. Lectio Divina, a type of solitary reading aimed at inspiration that we did from 5:30 AM to 6:30 AM, is a practice peculiar to Benedictine monasticism. Applying this in sacred psychedelic practice, during the early central phase of a session, is a matter of focusingone's eyes and consciousness on sacred scripture and reading aloud or to oneself. This will definitely broaden one's scope as one penetrates the hidden mystical meaning of \"The Word\". This technique is one of the greatest gifts of the Benedictine tradition. Praying the rosary, a discursive type of meditation that was optional and tookplace at various times, is kind of a tight discipline for a psychedelic mind, especially when done with a group of monks and visitors, but staying with it paid off in mind-blowing revelations into the mysteries. There is all this and so much more, up to and including the beauty of participation in the liturgical ritual of the Mass,The Highest Art La gloria di colui che tutto move per l'universo penetra, e risplende in parte piu e meno ciel e vidi cose che ridire chi di la su discende... -Saint DanteThe Art of Combining T raditional Consciousness T echniques with Advancing Consciousness Technologies in Sacred Psychedelic Practice By Brother Andrew H... 37 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1which at a monastery proceeds at a pace which is slow and punctuated with meditative pauses, and is rather attuned to reflection. Of course, some of my sessions were not all that smooth and easy - especially at the beginning of the early eighties when I was trying to get a handle on preparationand timing. Sometimes things would get awk- ward and occasionallysomewhat difficult. I remember one time especially. It wasChristmas Eve, 1983. I always got \"high\" on the High Holidays, so I pre-pared for Midnight Mass by cleaning up and going to confession(very helpful) and fast- ing for the day, etc. About two hours beforemidnight, I took two hundred fifty micro- grams. Well, when Iwalked into the church at midnight I was feel- ing very awkward in-deed. I was thinking that I had taken too much, or too much toolate, or something. It was intense, and an ex- tra large crowd of visi-tors had come to cel- ebrate with the monks. Oh no, all this fidgetingand the amplified rustling sounds of strange synthetic materials, little whisperings. Wait, \"Remember the teach- ings\". Meditate, breathe, breathe. Ugh, the smells ofperfumes mixing in the air...breathe? Midnight Mass at a monastery is usually long and very beautiful, and after what seemed like a very, very longtime it was finally time to receive communion. At last, thank God, it's almost over. Feeling very uncomfortable and self-conscious, I bowed my head - like monks aresupposed to do anyhow - got in line feeling kind of stiff and mechanical, moved along towards...Father Joachim.I was gazing down at his sandals when I heard him saying, \"Brother Andrew, Body of Christ\". As I looked up, he was holding up the consecrated bread as though he wasshowing it to me. He had this gentle smile, and his face was absolutely beaming with joy, and love and camarade- rie. His eyes, his eyes were twinkling, really twinkling, and in that instant, even before he placed the consecrated host in myhand, in the twinkling of an eye, everything was transformed. Trans-fused with a special kind of light that seemed to softly light up the airand even seemed to light up the light itself. And suddenly...it wasChristmas! And a glori- ous and blessed one at that. Thank you again,venerable Father Jaochim, for that gift, wherever you are. Andthat, in truth, is what happened. Yes. And it went on and on, andanyone who knew Fa- ther Joachim knows that he did things likethat. Incidentally, the late (saint) FatherJoachim was guestmaster at the Ab- bey of Our Lady of Gethsemane in Kentucky when thelate (saint) Thomas Merton entered the novitiate there. It was Merton's written work, particularly Ascent to Truth and Seeds of Contemplation, that led me to check out the Trappists. And now, after reading all of his (fifty plus) published books, some of his unpublished work, and listening to many of his unedited taped conferences, I cansafely say that not only was he a mystic, but also that he was definitely curious about LSD-25, that he was open to its possibilities, and, I suspect, that he probably \"experi-mented\" with it. I think that is to his credit. I think he was a saint. Our Lady of the Holy Spirit38 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1Now at this point a few things should be made perfectly clear: 1) I don't consider secret psychedelic prac- tice any more reprehen- sible than the secretpractice of Christianity by the early Christians living under a reign ofpersecution. What is reprehensible is persecu- tion - especially in a country like ours where freedom ofworship was constitutionally guaranteed in the Bill of Rights from the beginning. 2) I don't refer to sacred psychedelics as \"drugs\", and I don't refer to the Body and Blood of Christ as \"Bread and Booze\". And I know it's not right (generally) to consider either in the context of substance abuse. 3) Please note that though I was conducting these sessions right \"under the noses\" of the monks, I did manage to conduct myself responsibly and (contrary to alot of sensational media coverage regarding psychedelics) never once did I \"freak out\" or \"flip out\" or have to be talked down, tranquilized, hospitalized, or whatever. If you've read this far, you may be asking, who is this guy? Who is this person? Well, I like asking myself that same question. \"Who am I?\" Matter of fact that's one ofmy favorite questions. \"Who am I?\" Now, with all due respect to Saint Salvador Dali, I will answer like this: The three best things that can happen to a person in this life are: 1) To hit the jackpot in prayer, i.e., to be elevated to the supernatural vision of the essence of being. 2) To be a pioneer in the ultimate frontier of art- high art- the sacred art of getting high, and in truth, turning towards the essence of being. 3) To be known as Brother Andrew H..., a.k.a. Mahatma. Fortunately these three things have happened to me and I am grateful. Among the maxims on Lord Naoshige's wall there was this one: \"Matters of great concern should be treated lightly.\" That's from the Hagakure. The Book of the Samurai. Now it is the second of the \"three best things\" that is the theme of this here little disquisition - the high art ofcombining traditional consciousness techniques with advancing consciousness technologies in sacred psyche-delic practice, to the proximate end that, in this life, the best minds will be inclined to turn and strive towards absolute unitude. \"Youpropose a high and mighty art indeed,\" one may say. Yes, even the venerable saint Socrates only speculated that there \"might be such an art\" and what it might be like, in the cave parable in The Republic. As meditation -- controlling one's mind -- is integral to the life of a person on a psychedelic journey as it is to a person on a monastic journey, and since I was on the pathwhere these two converge, I quickly realized how inept I was at this \"vague\" thing called meditation. The very thing that seems to distinguish Eastern traditions fromWestern traditions is actually alive and ongoing (though almost hidden from the mainstream) in some Western monastic orders. But, the fact is, the teaching of medita-tion in both the East and the West has been pretty much an inefficient, trial and error sort of thing, taking a long time. Most people who bother to start end up dropping itanyway, even if they have charismatic teachers and read the best books on the subject. This is where the marriage of meditation and electro- encephalograph (EEG) monitoring technology comes in. Anyone who really wants to learn how to meditate can go to someplace like the Anna Wise Center in MarinCounty, and with their technology -they use the Mind Mirror III - and their knowledge of meditative brainwave patterns, one can learn or improve more in ten days thanin ten years elsewhere. That may be an exaggeration, but it is only a slight one. The point is, that with the use of EEG monitoring, one can learn to meditate quickly,easily, and enjoy the process of learning it at the same time. Just verifying the fact that one is meditating can be quite validating. One can also learn how to deepen one'smeditations, and further on one can learn how to use these mind machines to help others. On one level that's what this marriage of technology and meditation is allabout. Picture if you will, some progressive novice master speaking to a novice monk at their weekly \"conference\"sometime in the near future. \"Hmm, Brother Ellipsis, looking at these printouts of your brain rhythm patterns\"I usually timed my psychedelicsessions to start in the evening, sothat I would still be high, but nottoo high, when I got to my choirstall at 4:00 AM.\"39 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1from last week, it is evident that the depth of your \"meditatio\" has increased considerably. It seems that just that element of \"relaxing your tongue\", and therebydisconnecting the thoughts and giving the thinking mind a rest, has reduced beta rhythms. What I see here looks real good. Might want to practice that this week too.Maybe see more improvement in controlling the mind. OK. Then, if you're ready, now let's get hooked up to this new little portable unit here and give it a go...but first, asusual, let us begin with a prayer. \"Father, May our the spirit of truthAnd in the name of yoursonJesus, the anointed one.Amen.\" OK, now we come to one of the high points of this ar- ticle, and this here is my at-tempt to rescue psychedelics from the limbo to which they have been temporarily (andrightfully so) consigned by the general public. What follows is a contribution to the psy-chedelic transpersonal com- munity. We know that \"set\", as in \"set and setting\", is one of the important factors in the context of a psychedelic session. We know that brain activity is altered by external stimuli.We have technologies that can quickly and easily activate specific brain states. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that we learn to apply, like salve, the appropriate tech-nologies to psychedelic sessions. During the preparation, for example, one can establish a healthy meditation brain wave pattern using binaural beat technology. In the entryphase, sustain that pattern. In the central phase, maintain and perhaps imprint, not a doctrine but a known, non- verbal optimal performance brain rhythm pattern. In there-entry phase, maintain and support that pattern. In the immediate post-session follow-up, reinforce, etc. ...From before the beginning.........Until after the end...... ...The skillful, loving application of the salve of certain known good binaural mind rhythm combina-tions can, in truth, definitely, nonverbally, help improve and sometimes even beatify a psychedelic session in a good setting. Also, in the context of set and setting, there's this fundamental thing about music. All psychedelic people know how very important the selection of music is to asession, but only some realize that all music drives brainwaves. One may want to go back and carefully check out (via EEG monitoring) exactly what brainwave statessome of that music is (probably unwittingly) generating, especially if one, or anyone around one, is having difficult \"trips\". Seriously! Now, we have access to readily avail-able metamusic - music that is artistically and technologi- cally designed with certain complex binaural frequency Brother Andrew H... \"I don't consider secret psychedelic practiceany more reprehensible than the secretpractice of Christianity by the earlyChristians living under a reign ofpersecution.\"40 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1patterns imbedded in the music in order to generate, activate, or access specific brain states \u2014 the implications and possibilities here are really big, especially if one isseriously considering a safe design (protocol) for a psyche- delic (research) session. What is being suggested here is establishing a fair degree of external control of the \"action potential\" of the internal electrochemical signaling system of rapidly firing neurons. In effect, both filing a flight plan and adding aguidance system that can help enable one to navigate into appropriate mind states. From here one can handle arising content like a proverbial Zen master - and evenbetter. Considering that all one is adding are some appropriately designed recordings of precision sound frequencies to a stereo system with good speaker separa-tion, or headphones, it is a fairly easy thing to do. This can be positively beneficial in a psychedelic session especially during that phase when the cognitive faculties lose domi-nance. Then, even advanced meditators may find that relaxing into the comforting sup- port of a good recorded medita-tive brainwave net may be the best Bon Voyage thing to do. Flashback. One time when I was really high (I find myself saying that a lot) meditating, in a crowd at Gusman Philharmonic Hall in Miami, before aBrahms double-header, this guy came in all spastic, legs wobbling, head bobbing, arms flopping about, and sat down and continued bobbling around in his seat \u2014 rightin my field of vision. \"Uh-oh,\" I thought, \"this guy's gonna be entirely too distracting.\" But when the concert began, something amazing happened. Sometime withinthe first few minutes of the first movement, his move- ment settled down. His body came to rest, and he was still. At first, my mind began to glide with the music. NowI usually don't have to try hard to discipline my thinking mind if I'm sitting, listening in a symphonic mind-field. But I had to think about this. This is physical! What'sgoing on here? Let's see. Observe. There's one distinct set of sound waves extending from the violin section of the orchestra all the way to my left ear and on to my olivarynuclei...and another somewhat separate set extending from the viola/cello section to my right ear and olivary nuclei. The combination was making one single overrid-ing pulsing pattern that was lighting up a whole higher network throughout my entire brain (looking into one'sown mind-brain is resting in the Buddha mind). Wow, neural communication! To the max! Making for smooth sailing in my mind and, what's more, actual physicaltherapeutic neural control in his formerly spasming body, enabling him to sit perfectly still. The implications were as clear as the waves of sound in front of my eyes...focusing...sound waves...stimulating therapeutic neural communications. Aha! It was so obvious. Beautiful. Naturally, I checked some of this stuff out back in the laboratory about an hour away from the monastery. It was anecdotal work, but somebody had to do it. It was very interesting looking at a color monitor and seeing, inreal time, the motion of a compressed spectral array of my baseline brainwave pattern. After meditation, I was able to glance up at the monitor and see both hemispheresperfectly synchronized. And later, I was amazed to see how swiftly psyche- delic consciousness responds to binaural One could a ses- sion that would be so nice, sosmoothe, that one could be- come accustomed to being...so...yes. It's a whole new psychedelic ball gamenow, but the ideas are the same as ever. Just as in meditation, LEARN TO CONTROL ONE'S OWN MIND, brainwaves if you will. (Unless of course one isleaving that up to someone or something else). And the ancient message is the same. THE ESSENCE IS LOVE...THAT'S TRUE. Now we have these new tools along with the old tools that can, in truth, if we use them wisely, help us to transcend, maybe even actually know (and this is su-premely important) absolute unitude...which is the one...prerequisite...for subsequent true self-transforma- tion. If one is already a psychedelic person and wants to check some of these ideas out, for starters one can call up, or dot com, the Monroe Institute in Faber, Virginia, forbinaural stuff; or the Anna Wise Center in Larkspur, California, for the marriage of mediation and technology stuff; or Jeff Labno at Tools for Wellness in Chatsworth,California, for one stop shopping for the whole array of mind tools. And if you do try this stuff at home, please, be\"...one can establish ahealthy meditation brainwave pattern using binauralbeat technology.\"41 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1responsible. These are some powerful combinations. There are three things that are not in the books yet that happen sometimes that make the re-entry phase veryimportant. 1) Some people get so high, so smoothly, and get so accustomed to the brightness and clarity and seeing intothe mysteries, that they don't want to come down...andwhen they do, they start to be disappointed. 2) Some people have gotten so high that they actually thought that they would never come down, but they did.And they were disappointed, too, to find out that all phases of consciousness, no matter how transformative, are transient in this life. Such is life itself. 3) The more spiritually mature sometimes get so high that when they come down they immediately start get- ting themselves together so that when it happens againthey can stay there longer. In the meantime, if they love their neighbors as themselves, they set about to share this with them. Yes, all three of these things have happened to me. That is why I suggest this: Please, be responsible and remember that the re-entry phase is real important here.For what it's worth, I recommend prolonging the session as long as possible through meditation, which is real easy for a psychedelic mind supported by recorded binauralmeditation rhythms. Just relax into it. Meanwhile, back at the monastery, it was a warm early summer evening in 1986, and the time was ripe foranother secret sacred psychedelic session. That day, while in the library, I had found a little paperback book entitled, The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries,which I read while I was going about the monastic horarium and making my usual \"preparations.\" After Compline (night prayer) I took a \"power nap\" and 'roundmidnight I got up, dosed (about 500 micrograms) and laid back down for a smooth lift-off. I knew it was going to be a big one when I heard those electric buzzingbeeping sounds moving around in my auditory system. When I hear that I know it's really coming on. It was about an hour later when, totally unintentionally, mymind suddenly went transpersonal...through the floor and the walls down and directly into Dom Armand's (the abbot then) sleeping mind/brain. He woke up startled atthe sudden brightness. Oops, I thought, I'm outta here. As quickly as my mind had slipped out of my body...it was back. Whew! That was a close one. Don't want to blowmy cover, got to get my trip together.The church...just one floor down and a few steps over and I'd be in the back of the church. I can negotiate that! For further silence and solitude, I went into the Confes-sional and sat to meditate in the dark of the confessional,, in the dark of the church, in the dark of the night. When I finally settled my breathing into a good rhythm, thatbook, The Road to Eleusis, came to my mind. What was that weird hermaphrodite thing that had been men- tioned? From the depths of that thought somethingsubtle started. Gradually, I became aware that each cell in my entire body was orgasmically connected with each and all the surrounding cells. My whole electric cellularbeing was...yes...yes...yes...yi! It continued like that for about an hour and then, very gradually, it subsided and was gone. Then, sitting there in the stillnes, a new episodebegan. My bladder was tense. I had to go to the bathroom. It seemed so far away...and what if I run into a monk? I'm too high for that! But I had to go so I began making myway slowly through the bright darkness, through the thick molecular air, along the full length of the nave of the church, along the aisle behind the choir stalls, on theabbot's side, slowly, softly, toward the door that leads to the east side of the cloister garden. I was stopping every six or seven steps, listening. \"Now, the ears of my earsawake...\" Crickets. The shrill sound of male cicadas, sirens twenty-three miles away in downtown Conyers. Then, through the door and along the east cloister garth,stopping, listening. Somebody flushed a toilet back over in the guest house. Some monk just turned off a faucet on the second floor, on the south side of the cloister, walkedto his room, and closed the door. Silence. Past the chapter room, through the next door into the south wing of the cloister and down to the first landing, listening. . . I canhear for twenty-five miles now. One last check, stopping in front of the bulletin board, seven steps away from the Grand Parlor (which adjoins the lavatory). Almost there,I listen...all's quiet...ahh. All the monks are sound asleep. Just seven or eight steps and I'll be...and from out of nowhere, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, the sound of robeswhooshing, and from around the corner of the Grand Parlor, the five hundred microgram beam from the face of...superconscious Father Joachim...walking. How didhe do that? I can hear forever! He just walked on by, head bowed, beaming and smiling to himself. Of course, he didn't say a word, as monks don't speak during the GrandSilence of the night. I was speechless...mind blown, wondering: How did he do that? He looks as high as I am.42 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1He's not high on acid. No, he can't be, but...almost forgot where I was going. 'Took me years to come up with an explanation. It could have been that he was \"hiding\", just around the corner of the doorway, in a corner, praying...I'd inadvert- ently discovered venerable Father Francis Xavier \"hid-ing\" in different places, praying along the way, when I was going one place or another to do something. Those venerable old ones have some amazing ways. But still,though many years have passed, sometimes I wonder, since I could hear for twenty-five miles, how did he just appear like that? How did he get so high? Looking over the years now, it's no big wonder that with the secret psychedelic life that I was living, even with all the many years in monasteries, I never became athoroughbred monk. Now, I am just a self-professed hermit monk, not associated with any particular Order, living in the high (of course) desert, peacefully, in silence,and solitude. I still venture into \"the world\" occasionally. I like some of the music I hear, and some of the ideas floating around, and some of the things I see being doneto make it a better world. As a matter of fact, try this on for size. An awakened mind-brain rhythm pattern being generated binaurally between musical acts at a festival,with all that big stereo equipment already set up and psychedelically sensitized audiences of thousands. Alle- luia! Let 'em all try on an awakened mind and see, intruth, how nice it really is. Certainly with that help the best minds will be strengthened, and then they won't need any of those politicians or spiritual hucksters out to\"save the world\". They'll be able to just go on and do it themselves...and a lot more than that, too. These generations could possibly turn out to be the most illuminated of all time...and not only \"save the world\", but ILLUMINATE ALL LIFE, and transform all existence. A bit much you think? What about theSecond Coming? Be all that as it may, please allow this exercise to stand as an illustration of the high art of appropriating science to the sacred and combining themso as to bring out the best that is within. Now that's real art. That is high art. Please remember, the first best thing that can happen to someone in this life is to be elevated to the supernatural vision of the essence of being. Well, when that happens, and in truth it does happen from time to time, one mightcall it a masterpiece. Sometime, somewhere, when you least expect it, that masterpiece might well be you.Definitely you in all your glory in God's infinite majesty. And your Self will be the inspiration that all works of art are meant to be. And with that, I'm just gonna go outside now and watch the early dawn Venus rise...and Jupiter is up there...and Saturn (the home planet of Dante'scontemplatives), now between the horns of Taurus, the bull. So please, if you will, Let us, in the spirit of truth,Pray for one another,The highest prayer:That weMay be one With the Father, In unitude, Enjoyment, And beatitude In the essence Of love. Who am I? Bro. Andrew H... Thank you. Amen. Selah43 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 oth meditation and psychedelics are close to my heart. I'm grateful to both of them for having shown me that true essence of the heart, which is the heart of everyone and everything, our ultimate belonging and source of meaning. For starters, psychedelics began disrupting my, up until then, fairly smooth and protected life - enough to be able to ask, for the first time, a deep and urgent question. This kind of questioninggoes far beyond words and concepts and leaves nothing untouched. We think we know about ourselves and the world. It is incredibly freeing and quite confusing. Next, meditation harmonized it all again, so that I could live with a measure of integrity and ease. Then, after manyyears of rigorous formal practice and complete abstinence, psychedelics have once again inspired my 'beginner's mind', getting me out of the habits and ruts that seem to be part of the package deal of life and which, though necessary and comforting, stand in the way of our fresh, direct experience. Now, I haven't traveled the psychedelic path much for about two years. It looks likeeverything has its time, life comes in cycles. This is how it was for me, and it does not seem to be so unusual. The dramatic rise of interest in Yoga, meditation and eastern religion in the 60s and 70s was closely related to the psychedelic movement. A poll conducted by the Buddhist magazine \"Tricycle\" shows that 83% of the 1,454 respondents had some firsthand experience with psychedelics. During the 80s and 90s many of the spiritual, once young ex-hippie communities had become middle-aged meditation centers with relatively few newcomers under the age of 30. The next generation seemed less interested in meditation, alternative lifestyles - and also inpsychedelics. On my recent trip through the States, during which I visited a number of meditation centers across the country, I noticed many young faces again. Being accompanied by my twenty-year-olddaughter, I had easy and quick access to them and I was not surprised to learn that most of them have had some contact with mind-altering plants and chemicals. So what is the relationship between psychedelics and meditation? One way to approach such a question is to first look at the meaning of the words independently. \"Meditation\" has roots in the Latin \"meditari\", which in turn has roots in the indo-Germanic \"med\", having something to do with \"measuring, walking, staking out\". We could define it as the act of exploring, walkingin, measuring, staking out the sphere of our consciousness. \"Psychedelic\" is based on the Greek words \"psyche\" and \"delos\", the first meaning \"breath, the seat of consciousness\", the second \"clear, visible\". Psychedelics can help us to clear our mind and make visible the nature ofconsciousness. So from the etymological point of view, through very different lineages, they are pointing in the same direction, the investigation of our inner being. This process is also known as 'practice'and the linguistic relationship of the two words mirrors the actual experience of many people: Very different means to investigate a very similar subject: Ourselves, the meaning of existence, the Ultimate. Viewed from yet another angle, the difference might not be as big as it seems: neurologists have discovered that physical exhaustion, prolonged fasting and other austerities (such as the Buddha underwent before his Great Enlightenment) as well as wound fever (such as Ignatius ofLoyola, the founder of the Jesuit order, as well as many other Christian Saints, suffered from at the time of their spiritual awakening) produce changes in the brain that are virtually indistin-Meditation and Psychedelics By Vanja Palmers (vanja@bluewin.ch) B \"Psychedelics can help us to clear our mind and make visible the nature of consciousness.\"44 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1guishable from the changes produced by the intake of psychedelics. At this point it might be useful to make a distinction between the virtue or goal of practice, the loving, benefi-cent and constant awareness of this never-ending process of exploration, and the methods that aim at getting us there. The former is universal, true and necessary foreveryone. Dogen refers to this when he states that \"Zazen has nothing to do with sitting or standing or laying down\" - and St. Paul when he admonishes us to \"pray atall times\". When it comes to the methods, we have a choice, and all of themwork sometimes and some- times they don't. Some work better for some peoplethan for others, and all of them have their relative strengths and weaknesses. Traditional main- stream Buddhist training does not include the use ofmind-altering substances. With very few possible ex- ceptions, they are simplynot mentioned in the sutras and other texts. Some think that they are dealt with inthe precept that states \"a disciple of the Buddha does not intoxicate mind orbody of self or others\". Oth- ers think differently: the same poll mentioned abovefound that almost 60% of the responding Buddhist practitioners felt that psychedelics and Buddhism do mixand that they would consider taking psychedelics in a sacred context (in the \"under 20\" category this percent- age was 90%). The traditional understanding of intoxi-cants refers to all mental and physical phenomena that foster confusion through fanning our likes and dislikes. And as the Buddha never fails to point out, ultimatelyeverybody has to decide for themselves what is what. While it is true that the setting and the techniques used at traditional Buddhist retreats are not geared to-ward the use of psychedelics, it is quite obvious that skills in meditation, the practice of being at peace within one's body and mind, even in uncomfortable places, can be ofgreat help in the course of a psychedelic session. Not only from this point of view, one could say that the practice of meditation is available to more people than the practice ofpsychedelics. Are there any dangers involved with the use of psychedelics? Yes, there are. They are very powerfulsacraments, or medicine, and they have to be approached with the utmost respect, preferably under the guidance of an experienced friend. The fears most commonly voicedare damage to body and brain as well as dangerousbehavior and addiction. The classic psychedelics, unlike substances such as heroin, cocaine, and alcohol, have virtually no organic toxicity in the quantities in which they are ingested. Their addictive risk is too small to bemeasured when used in ceremonial settings. Psychedelic traditions from the Vedic dawn to Eleusis to the Native American Church have succeeded in creating ritual con-texts in which hazardous acting-out is virtually unknown. But what of the dramatic changes which psychedelics can have on our psyche and spirit, our heart/mind, our consciousness? Of course this effect is the very reason for taking them in the firstplace. Is it ultimately helpful or harmful? A moment after his great awakening, a Zenmaster exclaimed \"...my life is completely ruined...\". As we get closer to the life forceitself - not just our ideas about it - our categories and points of view are put intoperspective, and their rela- tive nature becomes obvi- ous. And it is from this per-spective that we must judge the value of any given expe- rience. Buddha recommends to view our life \"as a dream, a flash in the darkness, a starin the morning dawn, a bubble in a stream, an illu- sion of the senses\". The aimof practice is to wake up from that dream. One ques- tion often asked after a deep experience is: Was it agenuine awakening, or was it just another dream within a dream, another illusion within an illusion? Personally, I don't worry too much about this. A primary religiousexperience is the seed for a spiritual life, no more and no less. No matter how genuine the encounter with the Ultimate might be, it does not guarantee a genuinespiritual life. The experience may be authentic, but what counts is our daily life - and how authentic it is depends on how we live, its quality, what we do with it. Will we beable to muster up the necessary determination and pa- tience to let the light which we glimpsed for a moment, be it through meditation or psychedelics, gradually pen-etrate our whole being? Will we allow the experience of oneness and belonging - whether or not it wasn't really real - to inspire and transform our lives? This is ourchallenge and our hope, individually and as a species. Vanja Palmers has practiced Zen for thirty years and has received Dharma transmission from his teacher Kobun Chino Roshi. He lives with his family in Switzerland and is the head of a meditation and animal rights center.\"The traditional understanding of intoxicants refers to allmental and physicalphenomena that fosterconfusion through fanning ourlikes and dislikes. And as theBuddha never fails to point out,ultimately everybody has todecide for themselves what iswhat. \"45 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 TIME ince very early days, time has bedazzled and intrigued humans. More than 1500 years ago, Indians identified time as the basis for mundane reality. They equated the creation of time as the first step in thecreation of the universe. This age-old belief received scientific confirmationin Einstein's theory of relativity. Einstein also added support to the conceptthat time and the mundane reality are both non-substantial. Time, Einsteinshowed, was relative and therefore, the mundane world with time as its basisalso had to be ephemeral. Change in the flow of time triggers drastic changesin matter and its formations. The flow of time is subject to influence by suchfactors as gravity, and it does not flow at the same rate in different parts of theuniverse. Even here on Mother Earth, atomic clocks have been shown to tickat different rates on mountaintops and in supersonic jets. The mathematical concept of time has a better scientific basis and is preferred by the purists. Nevertheless, for most people, time means apersonal experience of time. Humans experience time both subjectively andobjectively. The swing of the pendulum, the movement of the clock's hands,and the sunrise and the sunset are some of the perceptual indices of thepassage of time. We also have an inner sense of time; even in the absence ofperceptual cues, we are aware of the flow of time. A number of bodilyfunctions, of which one is barely aware and over which one has minimalvolitional control, are time-based. Most, if not all, biological phenomena arecyclic (cycles per unit of time). Breathing and heartbeat are good examplesof this. While some biological functions have long cycles (menstrual cycle,for example), others (like pulse) are much shorter. Many endocrine andautonomic functions have diurnal cycles. The electroencephalogram (EEG) that provides information about levels of brain activity is also cyclic. The crests and troughs that characterizeEEG readings form the objective basis for dividing the human experienceinto three broad categories: wakefulness, dream sleep and dreamless sleep. Infact, the entire human life is contained within these three chapters. Theancient Sanskrit word \"aum\" is derived from three letters, one representingeach of these three phases. Aum, which is closely related to the Latin \"omni\",means \"everything\". Both \"Omni\" and \"Aum\" have strong religious andspiritual connotations. Time perception is different during these three phases. It is strongest during wakefulness, somewhat weak during the dream phase, and almostabsent during the dreamless phase. If time, a created element, is notsubstantial, the waking experience built around it should also be phantas-sBy Dr. Roy Mathew, Professor of Psychiatry and Associate Professor of Radiology Duke University Medical School (Mathe008@mc.duke.edu) \"Since time is the axis for perceptual reality, transcendence of perceptual reality would seem to involve alteration in time perception. Thus, the effects of the purportedly consciousness- altering drugs on time perception should be of interest.\"46 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1mal. By the same token, dreamless sleep (where time is felt minimally) should be the most \"real\" of the three, withthe dream phase falling in between. According to theeighth century Indian philosopher Samkara, \"In thedream state where there is no object, mind on its owncreates everything; and it also creates everything seenwhen awake as well. There is little difference between thetwo states. Everythingwe see is a creation ofthe mind.\" \"Duringdreamless sleep whenthere is no object at all,no pleasure or pain,consciousness shines inits own glory.\" From the very early days, humans were nottotally satisfied with themundane experienceand the associated real-ity. Intuitively, theyquestioned validityand explored ways andmeans for achievingmore satisfying states ofmind. Among the many routes they found, the use ofdrugs was the earliest and the most widely used. Theancients came across a number of vegetal derivatives withmarked effects on the quality of the conscious experience.In 1500 BC, the Aryan hordes that came over theHimalayas to the Indo-Gangetic planes brought withthem the mythical drug, soma. According to the RigVeda, their ancient anthology of hymns, soma catalyzedcommunion between humans and gods. \"We have drunkthe soma; we have become immortal; we have gone to thelight; we have found the gods. What can hatred and themalice of mortals do to us now?\" The botanical identityof soma is a matter of controversy, although R. GordonWasson of the Botanical Museum of Harvard Universityidentified it as Amanita muscaria. Elsewhere in the world, other consciousness-altering drugs gained popularity and acceptance. The Aztecs usedMexican mushrooms while the Huichol turned topeyote. Other South Americans found ayahuasca effec-tive while African tribes in Gabon and the Congo foundibogaine (Tabernathe iboga) useful. The Indian hemp(cannabis sativa) is one of the earliest and probably, thesingle most popular consciousness-altering drug. Evi-dence suggestive of its earliest use comes from the islandof Taiwan over 10,000 years ago. It was used in India,even prior to 1500 BC, before the Aryans arrived. Evi- dence suggestive of its use by other ancient civilizationsincluding the Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians,Scythians, Greeks, and probably, Hebrews, can be found. Since time is the axis for perceptual reality, transcen- dence of perceptual reality would seem to involve alter-ation in time perception. Thus, the effects of the purport- edly conscious-ness-alteringdrugs on time perception should be of in-terest. Unfortu- nately, such re- search is noteasy. Of the 150 or so such drugs known to West- ern science, verylittle pharmaco- logical informa- tion is availableon most. Many of these plants contain chemi- cals other than the substance responsible for the con-sciousness-altering effects, and these effects too have to betaken into account. Several of these plant extracts are tootoxic to be administered to human volunteers. Identifica-tion, isolation, and purification of the active ingredientare by no means easy and have not been carried out inmany cases. Animal studies are obviously easier; however,animals will have difficulty communicating altered con-sciousness to the experimenter. Animals do not seem tocare for many drugs used for consciousness alteration inhumans, such as peyote and psilocybin, which wouldsuggest brain mechanisms unique to humans. Although there is not a great deal of scientific infor- mation in this area, the effects of some these drugs on timeperception are known. Peyote cactus, LSD and mari-juana all produce significant distortions of time. Theavailable few studies vary substantially in sophistication. The effects marijuana and its active ingredient tet- rahydrocannabinol (THC) on time perception have re-ceived more scientific attention. Marijuana was found toslow both the subjective and objective perception of time.Many studies demonstrated altered time sense and theunderproduction of time estimations. In one study, 28daily marijuana users displayed greater time underpro-duction than 32 normal controls which indicated that the \"...crests and troughs that characterize EEG readings form the objective basisfor dividing the human experience intothree broad categories - wakefulness,dream sleep and dreamless sleep....Theancient Sanskrit word 'aum' is derivedfrom three letters, one representingeach of these three phases. \"47 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1marijuana-induced time distortion may persist beyond the acute phase of intoxication. Dr. William H. Wilson and I attempted to track the neurological basis forthe marijuana-in-duced alteration intime perception. Us-ing this The re-lationship between al-tered and timesense is that linked thecerebellum to an in-ternal timing system.Other investigators showed that the cerebellum wasinvolved in the temporal sequencing of motor activity. Inhuman subjects, cerebellar lesions were associated withimpairment in rhythmic tapping, a time-dependent task.Patients with cerebellar atrophy were found to be defi-cient at judging the relative duration of time intervals.Traditionally, the cerebellum has been associated withmaintaining balance and coordination of movements. Itmay indeed also be responsible for the timing functionessential both for balance and coordination. This finding needs confirmation. Studies on the effects of other consciousness-altering drugson time perception should be conducted. Wehave started projects on the effects of ketamineand mescaline. Change in time perception is accompanied by a number of other phenomena including distorted sensoryperception and an altered sense of self (depersonaliza-tion). Time transcendence, regardless of how it is broughtabout, often ushers in a very unique sense of well being,usually referred to as joy or bliss. Ancient Indians called it\"ananda\". Unlike the mundane pleasure that contrastswith pain, ananda is unimodal with no antipode. It istotally ineffable: it has to be experienced. Ananda has twoother accompaniments: \"Sat\" or truth and \"Chit\" orillumination. Together, sat, chit, and ananda(Sacchitananda) stand for divinity. The desire to overcome mundane reality is just as strong today as it was in the early days. With the giantstrides in biochemistry and pharmacology, newer or more refined drugs have made their appearance. LSD,mescaline, and THC are good examples.

My investigation is based,on the one hand, on extensive firsthand experiences with thebrew (at this point, I have partaken of it more than 130 times)and, on the other hand, on interviews conducted with almost200 individuals. Amongst my informants were indigenous andnon-indigenous persons from various places in Brazil and Peruas well as foreigners (that is, persons residing outside of SouthAmerica). These individuals differed in the levels of theirexperience with Ayahuasca and with respect to the contexts inwhich they partook of the brew. My investigation examines allaspects of the Ayahuasca experience - general atmosphere andfeelings, hallucinations in all perceptual modalities, ideations,spiritual and mystical experiences, modifications in people'soverall state of consciousness, transformations of personalidentity as well as non-ordinary overt behaviors and perfor-mances. A full report of the investigation is presented in aforthcoming book titled The Antipodes of the Mind: Charting the Phenomenology of the Ayahuasca Experience. In this short communication I discuss one aspect of the Ayahuasca phenom-enology that has to do with radical modifications in theexperience of temporality. The study of temporality is of special significance because, as noted by many thinkers\u2014philosophers and psychologistsalike (see Shanon, 1993 and Shanon, 1998), temporality is perhaps the most fundamentalconstituent of human cognition. Thus, any modification in temporality is of significantcognitive import, empirical as well as theoretical. Various such modifications areencountered with Ayahuasca. Like other psychotropic agents (for reports related to othersuch agents, see Mayhew, 1961; Watts, 1962), Ayahuasca can induce marked changes inthe experience of time. Here I would like to consider those changes that are so radical asto induce a feeling that is altogether outside the dominion of time; for further details anda more extensive theoretical discussion, the reader is referred to Shanon (2001).being outside the dominion of time By Benny Shanon, Department of Psychology The Hebrew UniversityJerusalem, Israel (msshanon@mscc.huji.ac.il) m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1A \"Perhaps the most marked, and the most common, modification in the temporal experience encountered with Ayahuasca has to do with changes in the rate of time's flow....it is as if in brief moments a person can accommodate what are experienced as long stretches of time.\"49 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1Changes in the rate of time's flow Perhaps the most marked, and the most common, modification in the temporal experience encounteredwith Ayahuasca has to do with changes in the rate oftime's flow. Specifically, time may be experienced to runfaster or slower than it normally does. The prevalentexperience is that in what objectively (that is, as measuredby the clock) is a short period of time, much can beexperienced. The contrast is especially appreciated whendrinkers of Ayahuasca consult the watch and discoverthat even though so much has happened to them experi-entially, in reality very little time has passed. What wehave here may be conceived of in terms of two frames ofreference. In the ordinary frame of time hardly any time has passed, whereas in the other, non-ordinary frame one seems to have traversed a very long duration. In otherwords, it is as if in brief moments a person can accommo-date what are experienced as long stretches of time. Ingeneral, it seems to me that the more powerful theAyahuasca inebriation is, the more pronounced is thediscrepancy between the two frames of temporality.Theoretically, in the limit, experiences of timelessnessassociated with unbounded duration may be experi-enced. In this sense, the Ayahuasca drinker will find him/herself to be, in effect, outside of the dominion of time. The state of affairs noted here is, I think, exactly that recounted in the Bible in conjunction with the war theIsraelites had with the Amorites (Joshua 10: 12-13): Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before thechildren of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou,Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. And the sun stoodstill, and the moon stayed, until the people hadavenged themselves upon their enemies. Impressively, the Maharal of Prague, the Jewish rabbinical sage of the 16th century famous for his Golem,explained this event by means of the coupling of twodistinct frames of references. Specifically, the Maharal(see Mallin, 1979) proposes that whereas the Amoriteswere in the ordinary frame of reference, the Israelites were in a non-ordinary one. When only a moment passed inthe ordinary frame (and hence, it seemed that the sun didnot move), an extended duration was experienced in thenon-ordinary frame, thus enabling the Israelites suffi-cient time to fight their enemies. The similarity betweenthis account and the phenomenon encountered withAyahuasca is striking. I shall further note that theMaharal's proposal probably presents the first employ-ment of the conceptual distinctions which, at the begin-ning of the 20th century, became the core of Einstein'sspecial theory of relativity. Interestingly, similar observations are found in the fantasy tales of C.S. Lewis in his The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Lewis, 1950) in which he recounts the adventures of children who passed through a wardrobe and entered into magical lands. The children's adven-tures in these other lands lasted hours, days, perhaps evenlonger; yet, as far as the ordinary world was concernedhardly any time elapsed at all. Thus, when the childrenreturned to the wardrobe and into their house, theyrealized that the adult members of their family thoughtthat they were absent for only a moment or two. The meeting of two frames of reference Another non-ordinary pattern involving the contrast between two frames of time has to do with non-ordinaryanchoring of temporal reference. Normally, we are situ-ated in the present: The past is gone, not to be retrieved,the future is not yet and still unknown and we, humanbeings, are confined to the now. This holds both thedefinition of our own being and that of whatever weperceive. Thus, if now\u2014Tuesday, 13:15\u2014I am in myhome in Jerusalem, what I perceive through the openwindow is taking place now\u2014that is, Tuesday, 13:15\u2014as well. This seems to be trivial, but with Ayahuascapeople may encounter patterns that violate this scheme. Itis quite common for drinkers of the brew to feel that theyare here, in the now, observing states of affairs happeningin other places, at other times. For instance, once I foundmyself looking through the hut in which an Ayahuascasession was held and saw a scenario which I interpreted as \"ln especially strong visions, drinkers may feel totally immersed in these scenarios and even act in them and engage in interaction with the objects, people and creatures that they encounter in them.\"m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 150 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 taking place in ancient Egypt. Even more powerful are cases in which Ayahuasca drinkers feel thatthey cross the boundary and enterinto the scenes of their visions. Insuch cases, drinkers feel not only that they have seen orwitnessed scenarios taking place in other times, but thatthey have actually been present in such scenarios. Experi-ences of this kind involve both non-ordinary space-traveland what may be regarded as time-travel. In especiallystrong visions, drinkers may feel totally immersed in thesescenarios and even act in them and engage in interactionwith the objects, people and creatures that they encounterin them. Transformations of identity may be experiencedas well. Since these experiences involve various facetswhich extend beyond the topic of temporality, I shall notdiscuss them any further here. The realm of the eternal Still more radical is the experience in which one feels that one is situated in a point of reference where one canobserve everything that has ever happened as well aseverything that will ever happen. This point of referencedefines the eternal, with respect to which all events havean equal temporal status. In a certain sense, they are allthere and one only has to look at them. From theperspective of the eternal, the temporal may, in a fashion,be reduced to the spatial. This, note, is reminiscent of theview presented by Spinoza (1670/1989, 1985) withregards to both determinism and the nature of time. Experiences of this kind are described by Alex Polari (1984), a Brazilian intellectual who is currently a leader ofthe Church of Santo Daime, a syncretic religion that usesAyahuasca (referred to as Daime) as a sacrament. Thefollowing are insights Polari gained during the course ofhis own firsthand experience with the brew: The Daime, simply, delivers us to all the Times. Overcoming the difficulties of our conscious-ness, which still has to establish differences be-tween what was, what is and that which will be.(p. 70) In conjunction with this, a useful analogy is to be found in Mayhew's discussion of the non-standard expe-rience of time he had with mescaline (Mayhew, 1961):When we read something, we are aware of one word coming after another. But when we de-tach our minds from the sense of the words andlook at the page as a whole, this impression fades,and we are aware that the words all exist togetherat the same time. (p. 298) Knowledge and the realm of meaning I would approach Mayhew's observations from a somewhat different perspective, focusing not on thewritten words but on the content they express. The bookis there - everything described in it is in front of the readerat the same time, now. The story that the book narratesprogresses in a certain sequence in time. Yet, we thereaders (especially if we have already read the book orheard the narrative) can open the book and read it in anyorder we wish. One can start by reading an episode thattook place in the middle of the sequence, then turn to anepisode towards the end of the book, and later to one atthe very beginning. Related to this is the epistemic status of the knowl- edge readers have of the narrative recounted in the book.A book takes time to read. It is also the case that if enacted,all the episodes in it would take time. However, theinformation contained in the book is all there at once.And so is the knowledge readers familiar with the bookhave. Actually, this pattern is quite general. Think of abody of information you know well: a novel, a scientifictheory, a piece of music. I ask you to think what it means,to appreciate what it conveys, to assess your understand-ing of it. How much time did it take you to do so? A fewmoments, I presume. At any rate, much less than the timeit would actually take to read the novel, to retrace thetheory, to listen to the musical piece. One's appreciationis, in a way, instantaneous. And the more knowledgeableor competent one is, the stronger the effect. For example,Mozart was said to have been able to grasp an entiresymphony in an instant (Ghiselin, 1952). But in truth, allof us know this feeling: When one knows something well,the grasping of this knowledge (as distinct from specificdemonstrations of it) seems to require little or almost notime. Taking a more general perspective still, we note that, by its very essence, semantics transcends time. We can all \"..Mozart was said to have been able to grasp an entire symphony in an instant.\"51 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 appreciate this when reading literary texts of past genera- tions, inspecting old photographs, or looking at works ofart from ancient civilizations. The child or the youngenamored couples that appear in them are long, longdead. Yet for the reader or the viewer the persons inquestion are forever children, adolescents or youngadults. Babyhood, adolescence and adulthood are notjust moments in biographical chronology, they are alsochapters in a story. It is the story of human life, that whichwe all enact in the course of our own individual lives. Theparticular manifestations of this story evolve in time, butthe basic patterns of the script transcend the contingen-cies of the temporal. These pertain to the domain ofeternal meanings. With Ayahuasca, similar appreciations are gained on a much larger time scale - that of human history. There are periods of peace and periods of war, times of success and times of failure. Kings reign and exercisegreat power but eventually they die. Likewise, entirecivilizations rise and fall. In grand Ayahuasca visionsone may be privy to a special perspective, by which oneobserves such historical events with the detachment ofdistance (which does not mean lack of empathy). Withthis, one savors a little bit of the taste of the eternal andappreciates the perennial meanings of life and Exist-ence. As the Biblical sage Ecclesiastes (Kohelet inHebrew) said \"There is nothing new under the sun.\"(1:9) In line with all this is another insight reported byPolari (1984): I understood that this truth is absolutely immune to any historicity....A truth that is not relative norrelativized by anything, which entered andsyntonized within a dimension of eternalpermanency....Above and beyond a finite con-sciousness depending on matter and ending withit. (p. 61) In the European civilization, the locus classicus for linking atemporality and semantics is Plato. According toPlato, meanings and regularities in the world are due tothe Ideas. The Ideas are abstract entities that embody alltrue knowledge - everything that is not affected by timeand change. Thus, the realm of the Ideas both specifies meaning and transcends time. Several informants withacademic education explicitly told me that withAyahuasca they felt they contemplated the \"Platonicspheres\". Observations along similar lines were also madeby Huxley (1971) in conjunction with his experienceswith mescaline. Interestingly, the association between atemporality and meaning is also encountered in Amerindian my-thologies. Overing (1985a, 1985b) reports that in Piaroa, a tribe from the Orinoco basinof Venezuela, in the world of the Gods' relationshipsbetween beings is defined in a manner that defies ordi-nary logical and temporal relationships. Overing explainsthis by noting that in this world relationships pertain tothe world of meaning. Analyzing the cosmology and metaphysics of the Piaroa,Overing also noted that theworld of the shaman, and that ofthe Gods, is outside of time.Indeed, instead of being definedby linear temporal contiguity,this world is defined by relation- ships of meaning. Overing (1985a) further reports thataccording to the Piaroa there is a realm which is beforetime in which the special powers of the Gods are guardedin boxes of crystal. Inter alia, these powers includerationality and the words of songs. It shall be noted thatthe knowledge pertaining to this realm is directly associ-ated with plant-induced hallucinatory experiences (inthis case, however, not Ayahuasca). Nirvana-like experiences Usually, the experience of eternity associated with Ayahuasca does not entail the abolition of movement.Phenomenologically, time ceases to be relevant, butmotion, progression and change remain. Specifically, thescenes one observes from the perspective of the eternal domanifest motion, progression and change. Much rarerwith Ayahuasca is the experience of cessation, in whichatemporality is coupled with stillness. In this case, peopledo not feel that other realms are revealed to them. Aspointed out by mystics in many traditions (for pertinentinformation and discussion, see Forman 1990, 1998),being in this state, one feels immersed in the very groundof all Being. There, neither language nor reflection apply,and hence no semantics. \"The past is gone, not to be retrieved, the future is not yet and still unknown and we,human beings, are confined to the now. \"52 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1Concluding remarks Our survey presented various states of mind experi- enced as being outside of the dominion of time. The veryencounter of such states counters the general statementwith which this paper opened, namely, that humanpsychology is grounded in time. This also contrasts withmy own basic view of cognition. Indeed, for me, thediscovery of the atemporal was intellectually most unset-tling. Throughout my professional career as a cognitivepsychologist and a philosopher of psychology, I havecome to maintain that human cognition is embedded intime and that all cognitive performance is achievedthrough action temporally unfolding in the real world.This, I have argued (see Shanon, 1993), is not merely atechnical constraint but rather it is an essential, mostfundamental, feature of human cognition. Theoretically,one could perhaps envision intelligent systems that oper-ate in a different fashion, but these would be radicallydifferent from the human one. Ayahuasca revealed atotally different picture to me: It presented me with acognitive mode which, in a fashion, defines a worldoutside time. The question as to how to reconcile thesenew discoveries with my general view of cognition per-plexed me quite a bit. Full discussion of this question is outside the scope of this paper. Here, let me confine myself toa brief summary statement. It could be suggested that human beings have the ability to operate, and exist, in two differentstates. Metaphorically, these may be conceived interms of the shifting of gears. The first state is theordinary one, and it is fully grounded in time. Theother, non-ordinary state consists of the freeing ofthe mind from the ordinary temporal constraints.That such freeing is possible is a major feat of thehuman psyche. The study of the dynamics of theshift between the two states is, I think, a cognitive-psychological topic of great interest. A theoreticalframework that shall account for it will encompassboth ordinary consciousness and non-ordinaryconsciousness and view them as specific cases obtained bymeans of variations in a common, general structure.Thus, the enterprise in question is, in essence, the devel-opment of what may be regarded as a general theory ofconsciousness. Theoretically, the main moral of the present discus- sion is the linking of atemporality and semantics: Therealm of atemporality is the realm of meaning. In essence,the underlying principle governing the experiences ofatemporality is the following: The more meaningful something is to us, the less bound by time it becomes. Itseems to me that in one way or another, all of us arefamiliar with this pattern. One does not have to be innon-ordinary states of consciousness in order to appreci-ate this, but, obviously, in such states\u2014as withAyahuasca\u2014the effects are by far more radical and theirimpact much more striking. Finally, let me underline the fact that in this discus- sion, I have not alluded to any considerations of paranor-mality. In this, I radically differ from many, perhapsmost, of experienced Ayahuasca drinkers. In the variouscontexts of Ayahuasca use phenomena like those citedhere are usually conceived either in terms of time travel (itis said that Ayahuasca allows one to actually go to the pastor even the future) or in terms of visits to other non-physical worlds. Thus, in both the indigenousAmerindian context and in the modern syncretic reli-gious sects employing Ayahuasca, the brew is said to bringits drinkers to other, separate realities. In the doctrines ofall the modern Brazilian religious sects that use Ayahuascaas a sacrament these are referred to as \"the astral\"; often,the notion of reincarnation is invoked as well. I have hadthose experiences which are characterized as pertaining tothe astral and I think I know what the protagonists of spiritualism are referring to. Yet, I do not subscribe to the parapsychological, supernaturalistic view. Instead, Iwould propose that what is referred to as the astral beconceived of as the realm of meaning. \"The realm of atemporality is the realm of meaning. ln essence, theunderlying principle governing theexperiences of atemporality is thefollowing - The more meaningfulsomething is to us, the less boundby time it becomes. \"53 m a p s v o l u m e X I n u m b e r 2 f a l l 2 0 0 1 References Bergson, H.
