Given that SCAM includes a wide range of therapies - about 400 different treatments have been counted - variable vaccination patterns may occur within consultations with different types of SCAM practitioners. A [recent analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21010379) aimed to evaluate differences between categories of SCAM regarding vaccination behavior among US adults. Data from the 2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; n = 26,742; response rate 80.7%) were used. Prevalences of flu vaccination, consultations with SCAM practitioners in the past 12 months, and their potential interactions were examined. 42.7% of participants had received the flu vaccination in the past 12 months, 32.4% had seen one or more SCAM practitioners. Users of any type of SCAM were as likely as non-users to have received a flu vaccination (44.8% users versus 41.7% non-users; p = 0,862; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95-1.07). Regarding specific SCAM types, - individuals consulting with naturopaths (p < 0.001; AOR = 0.67, 0.016; AOR = 0.9, 95 %CI = 0.83-0.98) were less likely to be vaccinated. Other SCAMs showed no significant association with flu vaccination behavior. Independent predictors for a flu shot were prior diabetes, cancer, current asthma, kidney disease, overweight and current pregnancy. As well, higher educational level, age, ethnicity, health insurance coverage, and having seen a general physician or medical specialist in the past 12 months were also associated with a higher vaccination rate. The authors concluded that SCAM users were equally likely to receive an influenza vaccination compared with non-users. Different SCAM therapies showed varied associations with vaccination behavior. Further analyses may be needed to distinguish influencing factors among patients' vaccination behavior. This survey confirms what we have discussed repeatedly on this blog (see, for instance [here](https://edzardernst.com/2016/01/some-naturopaths-are-clearly-a-danger-to-public-health/), [here](https://edzardernst.com/2019/10/homeopathy-the-complete-alternative-to-vaccination/), [here](https://edzardernst.com/2019/11/the-uk-society-of-homeopaths-a-hub-of-anti-vaccination-activists/), [here](https://edzardernst.com/2014/10/vaccination-chiropractors-espouse-views-which-arent-evidence-based/), and [here](https://edzardernst.com/2017/05/use-of-alternative-medicine-is-associated-with-low-vaccination-rates/)). The reason why consumers who consult naturopaths, homeopaths, or chiropractors get vaccinated less regularly is presumably that these practitioners tend to advise against vaccinations. And why do they do that? - Naturopaths claim that vaccines are toxic and their therapeutic options protect against infections. - Homeopaths claim that vaccines are toxic and their therapeutic options protect against infections. - Chiropractors claim that vaccines are toxic and their therapeutic options protect against infections. Do these 'therapeutic options' - detox, nosodes, spinal manipulation - have anything common? Yes, they are bogus! Conclusion: Many naturopaths, homeopaths, and chiropractors seem to be a risk to public health. "}
