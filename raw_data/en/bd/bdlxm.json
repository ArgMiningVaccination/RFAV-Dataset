Sometimes, smaller blogs with less traffic write a neat post and link to me, but I dont 'see' the post unless I happen to catch one of their readers clicking to me on SiteMeter. *FROWNY FACE AT TECHNORATI* I just happened to catch an interesting post at this blag, [Shiningthelights Blog](http://shiningthelight.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/did-a-mouse-leukemia-virus-contaminating-vaccine-stocks-cause-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/). Dude might be nuts, I dunno. But I do like a Q they brought up (a month ago, *FROWNY FACE AT TECHNORATI*): Is a mouse leukemia virus contaminating vaccine reagents the cause of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome? Now, this Q might be coming from a place of deep distrust of all vaccines or the government or whatever-- I dunno. Doesnt matter. Can you answer that Q? Then its a good learnin opportunity, even if it comes from a place of crazy. Do I think XMRV came from a contaminated cell line? It was one of my posts that got referenced, [Oops: Contaminated cell-lines from the NIH](http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/01/oops_contaminated_celllines_fr.php). No. But thats partially because I think XMRV has shit (or is one of many components, almost shit) to do with Chronic Fatigue. Its also because there are a gazillion cell lines with +gazillion uses-- And TZM-bls have nothing to do with vaccines. Like I said in that post, problems with that cell line are restricted to people using them as indicator cells for HIV-1 infection. Thats it. Thats all we use those cells for. But still, how do we know? Can we be certain XMRV wasnt introduced to the population via vaccines? Well, first we can wipe all the bacterial vaccines off the list (diphtheria, tetanus, pneumococcal, haemophilus influenzae type b, pertussis). Bacterial vaccines arent anywhere near cell lines. Then we can knock out anything grown in yeast (HPV, Hepatitis B). And measles, mumps, and influenza are grown in eggs. Polio is a sturdy little mo-fo. The stuff we have to do to it to 'kill it' would blow the brains out of a wussy, fragile, enveloped retrovirus like XMRV (I just have to use a teeny tiny bit of formaldehyde to kill HIV-1 in the lab). The people who have CFS now are too old to have gotten the chicken-pox or rotavirus vaccine, so Im not looking them up. So... we are left with Rubella and Hepatitis A. They are the only ones attenuated/grown in human cells... but theyre [lyophilized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyophilized), and have formaldehyde... Thatll pretty much kill XMRV. I guess technically, that evil 'formaldehyde' is actually kinda protecting you from wayward/undetected/undiscovered viruses in vaccines... Even ignoring that the epidemiology of XMRV in vaccines-->CFS doesnt make sense, Im not concerned that vaccines meant for human use have XMRV in them. *shrug* But it was a good question!
