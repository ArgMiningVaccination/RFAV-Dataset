No. J4-51/2018E-PDF 3 Executive Outline This report is intended to help readers better understand restorative justice and Indigenous legal traditions on their own terms, as well as help readers understand the relationship between them. It will discuss restorative justice and Indigenous legal systems independently, and through this process, will demonstrate how they are both similar in several respects, yet also quite different in other respects. This report will highlight how most, if not all, Indigenous legal traditions contain principles and mechanisms that can be described as promoting community healing, reconciliation, and the reintegration of the offender. However, this does not mean Indigenous le gal orders and restorative justice are the same Napolean and Friedland 2016; Snyder 2014). There are important features that make Indigenous legal traditions quite different from restorative justice processes, including how Indigenous legal traditions often use proactive/preventative strategies mediated through kinship networks (Gray and Lauderdale 2007), how they place a high importance on spirituality (Cameron 2005; Borrows 2010), and the historic use of punitive/retributive sanctions (Milward 2012; Napolean and Friedland 2014). While this report encourages readers to understand these approaches to justice as unique, this report suggests that there are opportunities for cross -cultural dialogue between advocate s for restorative justice and Indigenous legal traditions, as well as opportunities to learn from each oth er's experiences and journeys. The first section of this report will discuss restorative justice, and explore its underlying principles, as well as p rovide a brief sketch of various restorative justice programs that have been established in recent years. The second section of this report will discuss Indigenous legal systems on their own terms, but will pay close attention to the aspects of historic In digenous legal systems that can be described as \"criminal law\". The third section of this report will briefly discuss the international and domestic support Indigenous legal traditions have received in recent years. This includes reaffirmation from the Uni ted Nations, as well as the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which discusses how Indigenous legal traditions can contribute towards reconciliation. Despite this international and domestic support, the fourth section of this report will describ e the status of Indigenous legal traditions in Canada. While this section will emphasize the limited opportunities Indigenous legal traditions have been given to deal with legal matters compared to restorative justice processes, it will also discuss future considerations, and particularly how Indigenous legal traditions will likely have to be adjusted to meet contemporary realities, including contemporary human rights standards. The fifth and final section of this report will discuss the evolving relationsh ip between restorative justice and Indigenous legal traditions, and what these changing dynamics might mean. Restorative Justice Principles and Processes Although there is no universal definition of restorative justice, it can be generally understood as an approach to crime and conflict that brings the victim, the offender, members of the larger community, and oftentimes professional service providers together into a non -hierarchal setting in order to 4 collectively address a harm that was committed and t o set a path towards reconciliation between all relevant parties (Cameron 2005; Milward 2008). Drawing on notions of human interrelatedness, restorative justice sees crime and conflict as a breakdown of interpersonal relationships (Archibald and Llewellyn 2006). Therefore, restorative justice processes are supposed to restore, repair, and heal those relationships through meaningful and democratic input from all parties involved (Archibald and Llewellyn 2006; Tomporoski et al. 2011). These processes are mean t to produce a sense of responsibility in the offender after they have heard how their actions and behaviour have affected the vi ctim and larger community. This, in turn , is supposed to initiate a desire within the offender, but also within the victim and community, to begin the tough work of healing and restoring relationships, and rebuilding the community's well -being (Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime 2011). Restorative processes are not meant to restore interpersonal relationships to where t hey were before the conflict took place. Rather, restorative justice processes should be seen as forward/future looking in the sense they try to bring individuals, understood as relational human beings, into a position where they are capable of entering in to equal and healthy interpersonal relationships again without relying on criminal justice sanctions (Archibald and Llewellyn 2006). In practice, restorative justice programs across Canada are fairly pragmatic. They deal with both youth and adult offenders and address a range of offences. They usually arise within a community or are organized by social groups and organizations due to the belief that the existing justice system is not working well for their community. A common concern is that when the justic e system sends offenders to jail it only makes them better criminals when they are reintegrated back into the community. Many restorative justice programs are community based although many receive funds fro m government agencies on a case -by-case basis. Many Aboriginal communities have initiated restorative justice programs because of the program funding available and the willingness of police and jus tice personnel to participate. These programs can be broken down into the following categories: victim -offender mediation, family group conferencing, and a number of \"circle\" programs (Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime 2011). There is no single model or approach and restorative justice initiatives can vary a great deal and be qui te flexible which c an be a strength . Since restorative justice programs entered the Canadian and international scene in the 1970s, victim - offender mediation has been one of the most effective and most widely used program m odels in Canada (Tomporowski et al. 2011). This mode l tends to bring the victim and offender together with a trained mediator to discuss the crime, and develop an agreement that resolves the incident. However, there are usually no other representatives from the community. The setting is supposed to be a saf e and structured environment for the victim so that they are able to articulate how the offender's actions affected them, while the offender is given the opportunity to make apologies and hear how they can make reparations (Canadian Resource Centre for Vic tims of Crime 2011). Victim -offender mediation can occur at any stage of the criminal justice process, from pre -charge police diversions, to years into an offender's prison sentence. Depending on when, or at what stage, mediation takes place, will usually determine what kinds of reparations are acceptable (Canadian Resource Centre for the Victims of Crime 2011). It is important to note that since participation in this process is voluntary for both the victim and offender, and the fact the mediator has no re al power to enforce agreements, the success of victim - offender mediations depends on the genuine willingness of the participants to move forward and restore r elationships (Archibald and Llewellyn 2006). 5 Family group conferencing is based upon the Maori an d Samoan tradition of involving extended families in resolving conflicts. It has been adopted as the primary means of dealing with young offenders in New Zealand. In Canada, mediators, or facilitators, assist accused persons and their families to meet with victims, police, and others to discuss and resolve the incident. Most initiatives have focused on young offenders, but some communities are using this model with youth and adults in a process that is called community justice conferenci ng (Tomporowski et al. 2011). Lastly, the models most frequently used by Indigenous communities are sentencing circles, releasing circles, and healing circles, which are based upon the cultural traditions of certain Indigenous nations, particularly from western Canada, where families, Elders, and disputants meet to discuss and resolve criminal conflict. Participants sit in a circle and pass a \"talking stick\" or \"talking feather\" to each speaker so that everyone has a chance to speak and be heard, which reflects the Indigenous principle of including all voices. The different \"circle\" models mentioned above are all procedurally different, and are applied at different stages of the criminal justice process. For example, sentencing circles, which arguably have the most impact on the administration of justice since they are able to recommend a sentence to a sentencing judge, also tend to include the most state participants. Judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers are usually present during discussions, with judges usually having t he discretion to decide to follow the community's recommendation or not (Cameron 2005). Releasing circles also include state actors, but usually come together in prison after an offender has served part of their sentence, and are up for parole (Canadian Re source Centre for Victims of Crime 2011). Healing circles are the most ceremonial of the \"circle\" models, and come together at the end of the criminal justice process when the offender is about to re- enter the community after having served their sentence/g one through treatment. Part of the cultural traditions of western Plains First Nations cultures, healing circles encourage community participation, and are supposed to signify the closing of the conflict. Participants are allowed to express themselves, and talk about their personal healing journeys in a way that touches on how they dealt with the underlying factors that led to them getting in trouble in the first place, thus bringing their experience \"full circle\" (Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime 2011; Tomporowski et al. 2011). Legislation and Policy The various restorative justice programs mentioned above exist largely as policy initiatives, although they have solid foundations in law. Section 718.2 (e) in the Criminal Code of Canada states, \"[A]ll available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable should be considered for offenders, with specific attention being paid to Aboriginal offenders.\" The Youth Criminal Justice Act , which came into effect in 2003, also includes restorative justice principles, and emphasizes offender accountability, rehabilitation, and reintegration (Tomporowski et al . 2011) . The international community has come to see restorative justice as a legitimate approach to the administration of criminal justice . In 2003, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) recognized the importance of restorative justice as another way to address crime and conflict beyond traditional criminal justice methods. In 2016, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs adopted a resolution concerning r estorative justice in criminal matters . 6 Court Cases The Supreme Court of Canada reaffirmed the legitimacy of restorative justice in R. v. Gladue , and again in R. v. Ipeelee . While the facts and entire judicial history of both decisions are beyond the scope of this report, what is important about these decisions, especially the Gladue decision, is how the Supreme Court legitimized the use of restorative justice processes, and encouraged the government to consider alternatives to incarceration, especially when sentencing Aboriginal offenders. The Supreme Court came to this conclusion by interpreting the newly established s. 718.2 (e) of the Criminal Code of Canada, suggesting this provision to mean that a duty is imposed on sentencing judges to look at an Aboriginal offender's personal circumstances and familial history before determining a sentence, so that the sentence is able to better address those underlying factors that bro ught the offender into conflict with the law in the first place. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this in R. v. Ipeelee , restating that it was the intention of the Supreme Court of Canada in Gladue that sentencing judges always consider s. 718.2 (e) when they are sentencing an Aboriginal offender, regardless of the severity of the offence. Indigenous Legal Traditions Creating the Context: The Necessity and Complexity of Indigenous Legal Traditions According to Indigenous legal scholars, prior to the imposit ion of Western law on Indigenous people, Indigenous legal traditions were important organizing forces that shaped behaviour, guided relationships, and addressed conflict in Indigenous societies (Borrows 2006; Borrows 2010; Napolean and Friedland 2014). As Val Napolean and Hadley Friedland suggest, Indigenou s communities had to create laws that could prevent, or at least minim ize, conflict that arise s when human beings live together. Moreover, communities also needed to be able to address the conflict and pa in after an incident occurred, which usually took the form of a sanction. Much like contemporary Canadian sentencing goals, Indigenous legal sanctions were not necessarily punitive/retributive, since they were also motivated by notions of healing, reconciliation, and reintegration, and if need be, they demonstrated deter rence and denunciation (Milward 2012). In other words, Indigenous legal systems were a source of complex proactive and reactive mechanisms that attempted to produce and maintain a stable and predictable social world for Indigenous communities. However, it is not enough to say Indigenous legal traditions were/are simply a series of proactive and reactive mechanisms. This takes away from the complexity and richness of Indigenous legal systems, which were flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances, emphasized personal and community balance, and did not compartmentalize different sections of law in the same way West ern legal systems do (Chartrand 2015). Most Indigenous legal systems are/wer e not sorted into different areas of law like the Canadian legal system, where there are clear distinctions between criminal law, contract law, tort law, constitutional law, etc. which is reflected in how these areas of law are taught at law schools, as well as how they are g enerally implemented and practis ed by lawyers. Instead, a common theme 7 throughout most Indigenous legal traditions across Canada is the idea of law being interconnected and intertwined (Chartrand 2013). While there might be different so urces of law within each Indigenous legal tradition (i.e. creation stories, oral traditions, customs, positive/man -made law), these different sources of law do not change the fact the laws are/were all deeply interconnected (Borrows 2010). For example, the well-being of an Indigenous community largely depended on maintaining and fostering interpersonal relationships within the community, but it also depended on how the community maintained its relationship with the land, water, and animal worlds. Therefore, community well -being was maintained through \"family and even \"environmental law\", although these were not thought of as different spheres of law, or separate legal responsibilities. Instead, they were thought of as part of a person's kinship network/responsibilities (Borrows 2010). Therefore, kinship was law. Proactive and Preventative Strategies: Kinship as Law While Indigenous legal traditions certainly contained laws that prohibited violence, especially laws prohibiting gend ered and sexual violence, (Deer 2015) these sites of law that prohibited certain actions are not where one should begin a discussion of Indigenous law, even Indigenous \"criminal law\". Instead, it is important to first be aware that Indig enous societies did not have a centralized enforcement agency, like the contemporary Canadian criminal justice system, that could enforce the law through specialized police forces (Borrows 2010; Chartrand 2013). While there were Elders and other respected leaders of the community that might get involved in weighing evidence and judging the truth of an incident, (Milward 2012) for the most part, law in communities was lived (i.e. individuals aspired to always fulfill their kinship responsibilities) and enforced in decentralized kinship networks. Indeed, kinship was a crucial feature of Indige nous legal traditions, (Borrows 2010; Chartrand 2013; Napolean and Friedland 2014) since it produced a series of legal obligations and responsibilities towards others in one's family, clan, and larger nation, while also causing those same clan/family members to remind and support individuals to fulfill their kinship obligations. In other words, kinship was multidirectional, in that it shaped the behaviour of individuals, a s much as it informed and shaped the behaviour of the collective. With respect to the origins of kinship, as mentioned earlier, there are many sources of law that Indigenous legal traditions look to in trying to produce a stable social environment. A comm on source across most Indigenous legal traditions is an Indigenous society's creation story, which generally holds historical knowledge about the land, but also prescribe teachings and values, especially the significance of reciprocal (i.e. kinship) relationships. For example, the Haudenosaunee creation story depicts the way animals helped Sky Women when she fell from the Sky World, first cradling her in the wings of birds so she did not crash into the water on earth, to placing her on the back of a giant t urtle so she had somewhere to stay, to helping her plant vegetables in dirt and mud that an otter fetched from the ocean floor. While this story continues to describe the creation of the world, the important values to take away from even this short excerpt is the importance of relationships and helping others, which produces obligations towards those that helped you. According to the Haudenosaunee worldview, it should also be noted that since animals and plants helped Sky Women when she first came to this e arth, and helped her raise her children, humanity's obligations extend to the animal and plant worlds (Cousins 2004), 8 which is actually a common value found in all Indigeno us societies in Canada (Borrows 2010; Chartrand 2013). Since kinship has its roots in the \"original instructions\" given to human beings, but is also supported in man -made law, kinship was a serious site for moral and legal guidance, although kinship produced proactive actions more than it prohibited actions. In other words, in the face o f decentralized power networks that emphasized creating and maintainin g good relationships (Chartrand 2013), kinship can be described as legally requiring individuals to act and carry themselves in a way that ensured good relations, rather than prohibiting certain actions. However, the idea of \"requiring\" good relations and good conduct not only misses very explicit laws prohibiting certain acts, espe cially sexual violence (Cousins 2004; Deer 2015), but more importantly, it misses the cultural institutions and practices that surrounded kinship obligations, including childrearing practices, storytelling , and ceremonies, which all worked together to naturalize positive interpersonal conduct (Napolean and Friedland 2014). Much like an Indigenous nation's creati on story informed the importance of kinship, an Indigenous society's creation story also underlined those cultural practices that shaped a person's childhood, which in turn ensured an individual grew up into adulthood with an awareness and understanding of their kinship responsibilities. However, kinship could not always guarantee one would live up to what was expected of them. Responding to Anti -Social Behaviour and Violence At this point, it is important to restate that Indigenous legal traditions, via kinship networks, attempted to produce a stable and predictable social environment for community members in the face of inevitable conflict. When kinship responsibilities were ignored, or failed to shape someone's behavior, various legal responses were activated in order to restore community balance, promote safety, (Chartrand 2013; Napolean and Friedland 2014) and if necessary, demonstrate deter rence and denunciation (Milward 2012). Sanctions were therefore multifaceted and tried to achieve multiple goals, although the harshness of potential sanctions, especially those sanctions that attempted to demonstrate deterrence and denunciation, were held in check by important qualifications. Considering that historic ally, Indigenous communities generally did not have police , sanctions were usually enforced by family members, extended family members, or members of the same clan. This meant healing, reconciliation, and reintegration were priorities, if not the first response. As Val Napolean and Hadley Friedland point out, even if the person had committed a serious offence, the first response was not to inflict pain or seek vengeance, since the offender was also a family and community member, and someone that was loved (2014). However, this does not mean that off ender reintegration and healing always prevailed over in dividual or community safety. For example, in historic Haudenosaunee society, witchcraft was considered a very serious criminal offence, since it gave a person too much power, and could lead to them c ausing harm, and/or neglect their ki nship responsibilities (Cousins 2004). If someone was accused of practising witchcraft, the first response would be to determine the truth of the accusation (Borrows 2010). If there was truth to the accusation, then comm unity and family members would confront the person and ask them to stop, while also determining the accused's willingness to stop. Depending on the accused person's 9 response(s), the community could perform healing ceremonies to counteract their power (if t hey were willing to give up practising witchcraft), to watching them and observing their behaviour with the hope of eventually performing ceremonies (if they were reluctant, and/or seemed disingenuous about stopping practi sing witchcraft), to banishment an d/or execution (if they continued to cause harm and refused to stop practi sing witch craft) (Cousins 2004). In Anishinabek society, the Wetiko, or Wendigo, was thought to be a cannibalistic spirit that could inhabit human beings and make a person do things they normally wouldn't, like murder and/or eat members of their family/community (Borrows 2010; Napolean and Friedland 2014). If a community member was thought to be turning into a Wetiko, or was possessed by a Wetiko, the community's response depended on the offender's actions, the possibility of them being healed, and/or whether they represented a serious threat to themselves and the community. Like witchcraft, healing and reintegration were first responses, which was achieved through a combination of careful interventions, supervision, and ceremonies. However, if healing was unlikely, making offender reintegration impossible, then it was likely the person would be executed to ensure the s afety of the community (Borrows 2010; Napole an and Friedland 2014; Snyder et al. , 2014). Many Indigenous societies created explicit laws prohibiting sexual and gendered violence , so sanctions could be especially harsh as a way to demonstrate deterrence and denunciation, as well as hold the offender resp onsible for their actions (Deer 2015; Milward 2012). Unlike Canadian criminal justice practices, but much in line with Indigenous philosophies and kinship practices, the victim of sexual violence had an important role in determining the offender' s sanction and punishment (D eer 2015; Milward 2012). The rationale for centering the victim in the entire process was to restore balance in their life, as well as restore balance in the rest of the community, since sexual and gendered violence was an especially despised crime, and wa s thought to disrupt the community's moral balance. The most common sanction used in response to instances of sexual violence wa s corporal punishment (Milward 2012) although some Indigenous societies were kn own to use banishment and execution, primarily when there were concerns for broader public safety (Milward 2012). Support for Indigenous Legal Traditions Indigenous legal traditions have received both international and domestic support for their recognition, revitalization, and full integration and i mplementation alongside the legal systems of nation -states. While there are numerous sources to draw upon, the most significant resources demonstrating this support are the United Nations Declaration on the Right of Indigenous Peoples, and the Canadian Tru th and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action. Both of these documents describe the place and role of Indigenous people in international and Canadian politics. That is, these documents envision a decolonized world, and provide a clear path to achieve that vision, where Indigenous peoples are treated with respect and dignity, which means having their cultural, spiritual, social, political, economic, and legal institutions protected and respected (Anaya 2007). 10 The United Nations Declaration on the Righ ts of Indigenous Peoples The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) is an important document that provides a framework for states in the international community to look towards, and use it to ground changes in their relationship with Indigenous peoples within their borders. UNDRIP begins from the position that Indigenous people represent unique populations, and are worthy of having their cultural and political institutions protected by international and domestic law. UNDRIP fulfills this role at the international level, since it outlines how states like Canada should act towards Indigenous people, including, among other things, a call for states to recognize and implemen t Indigenous legal traditions. The first UNDRIP provision that supports Indigenous legal traditions is Article 3, which says Indigenous peoples have the right to self -determination. While this Article does not explicitly mention Indigenous legal traditions, the right to self- determination is an all -enco mpassing right that includes the right to exercise Indigenous legal traditions (B orrows 2010; Leonardy 1998). In fact, the right to self - determination provides a foundation for a more thorough implementation of Indigenous legal traditions, since self- deter mination, or self- governance, creates the space and capacity to develop laws at the local level in light of local realities, as well as pursue and protect cultural practices that support and reaffirm Indigenous legal traditions. Article 5 explicitly supports Indigenous legal traditions, saying, \"Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal , economic, social and cultural institutions...\" (emphasis added). However, UNDRIP does add an important qualification on its support of Indigenous legal traditions in Article 34, stating that Indigenous peoples have the right to exercise their unique legal traditions, but in line with international human rights standards. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Act ion The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action repres ents the most recent mainstream support for Indigenous law in Canada. Much like UNDRIP, the TRC Calls to Action represent a path towards decolonization and reconciliation in the wake of the Indian Residential School experience, which, among other things, attempted to destroy Indigenous cultural traditions, including the values that were integral to the operation of I ndigenous legal traditions (TRC 2015 b). The TRC Calls to Action contain numerous provisions that either explicitly or implicitly support Indigenous legal traditions. With respect to explicit support, both Calls to Action 42 and 45 call on different levels of government in Canada to work together towards reviving and implementing Indigenous justice systems in ways that line up with Aboriginal and treaty rights, as well as the values embedded in UNDRIP. In other words, the TRC suggests Indigenous legal traditions must be revived and implemented in order to achieve true reconcilia tion in Canada between Indigenous peoples and non -Indigenous peoples. But it also reaffirms UNDRIP's requirement that Indigenous legal traditions respect international human rights standards. In terms of indirect support, the TRC Calls to Action 27, 28, and 50 provide guidance regarding educational and institutional initiatives that can foster the growth of Indigenous legal traditions in Canada. Call to Action 27 encourages the Federation of Law Societies in Canada to have provincial law societies provide their members with cultural competency training in areas such as Aboriginal and treaty 11 rights, Crown -Indigenous relations, and most significantly, Indigenous law. Call to Action 28 is similar, but calls upon Canadian law schools to require all law student s take at least one course that discusses Aboriginal and treaty rights, UNDRIP, and most significantly, Indigenous legal systems. Finally, Call to Action 50 requires different levels of government in Canada to fund Indigenous law institutes, which would de velop, analyze, and utilize Indigenous legal traditions. Indigenous Legal Traditions and Reconciliation The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action, as well as the TRC Final Report, have much to say regarding the relationship between Indi genous legal traditions and reconciliation in Canada. Indeed, the Calls to Action, but more so the Final Report, contain details discussing how Indigenous legal traditions can contribute to reconciliation, which can be categorized into two general streams. The first is the symbolic significance of implementing Indigenous legal traditions in Canada. Considering that Canada has historically suppressed knowledge of Indige nous legal traditions (Borrows 2010; Napolean and Friedland 2014) and has denied the existence of such traditions (Napolean and Friedland 2014) , implementing Indigenous legal s ystems in would represent a major shift towards reconciliation in the relationship between Canada and Indigenous people (Borrows 2010; TRC 2015). Indeed, it would signal a shift away from ongoing colonialism, towards a nation -to-nation relatio nship based on respect (Borrows 2010). The second stream is more substantive and pragmatic, in the sense that utilizing individual Indigenous legal traditions, and approaching them as actual laws, can facilitate healing and reconciliation in a way that is meaningful and relevant to the people and local communities involved. This goes beyond the symbolic significance of what implementing Indigenous legal traditions would represent, since most Indigenous legal traditions contain values, processes, protocols, and ceremonies that actively promote healing and reconciliation by addressing and moving beyond colonialism and its ongoing aftermath (TRC 2015). For example, Haudenosaunee people p ractis e a ceremony, rooted in their own laws and kinship practices, called the Condolence Ceremony. The Condolence Ceremony is usually performed in times of personal and/or nation -wide grief, and done with the intention of restorin g balance in the communit y (TRC 2015a ). According to the TRC Final Report, \"The Condolence ceremony allows people who have been through traumatic experiences together \u2014those who are healthy, those who are in mourning, and those who have caused harm \u2014to work together to address loss es. Through this ceremony, apologies and restitution are embodied in expressive performances as people are called upon to tell stories and acknowledge losses related to the harms they have suffered. The ceremony occurs in a precise sequence, employing vivi d imagery, and can be used in many circumstances where trust and understanding have been broken because of a party's harmful actions\" (TRC, 2015 a). The Condolence Ceremony can provide a way for Haudenosaunee people to establish a new and equal relationship with Canadians, especially in the wake of the Indian Residential School experience. Healing and reconciliation would be grounded in Haudenosaunee laws, ceremonies, and diplomatic protocols. 12 The Mi'kmaq people of the Maritime region, or Mi'kma'ki (Mi'kmaq territory), also have laws and ceremonies that can contribute to healing and reconciliation in the wake of the Indian Residential School experience. Like the Haudenosaunee, reconciliation to the Mi'kmaq people relies on respecting and following Mi'kmaq laws, which means Canada and church officials should engage in Mi'kmaq ceremonies, feasts, protocols, and dialogue with Mi'kmaq people, with the intention of opening up space for a n ew relationship to develop (TRC 2015 a). With that in mind, ceremonies, feas ts, apologies, protocols, dialogue, and restitution represent a common approach to reconciliation amongst other Indigenous nations in Canada (TRC 2015 a). However, this does not mean that each Indigenous nation's approach to reconciliation is the same. On t he contrary, the Final Report stresses that a \"one size fits all\" approach is counterproductive to achieving reconciliation with Indigenous nations (TRC 2015 a). Canada must approach each Indigenous nation as a distinct people, with their own unique histori es and cultures, and begin the hard work that reconciliation requires in a way that prioritizes local Indigenous laws and protocols. As the Final Report points out however, Indigenous people should not be coerced to participate in reconciliation processes, but instead, should be able to decide when and how they will engage with Canada (TRC 2015 a). The status of Indigenous Legal Traditions in Canada Contemporary Realities: Colonialism and its effects on Kinship and Indigenous Law While the status of res torative justice programs in Canada does not require further elaboration, it is crucial to inform readers about the status of Indigenous legal traditions in Canada, especially colonialism's effect on kinship 2016). As was pointed out earlier, kinship was an important organizing force in historic Indigenous societies, considering it produced multidirectional legal obligations towards everyone and everything. Unfortunately, the residential school experience, the gradual erosion of Indigenous languages, the imposition of band council governments, the destruction of lands and ecosystems, the overall attack on Indigenous legal systems, as well as the prosecution and jailing of Indigenous leaders who fought to maintain their traditional kinship/legal systems, have all had a disastrous effect on the role of kinship in communities, as well as an overall negative impact on general awareness of the importance of kinship (Napolean and Friedland 2014). Although kinship still functions to a certain degree in most Indigenous communities in terms of providing a loose framework to guide interpersonal and familial relationships, to having an influence on the actions of leaders, and even informing a person's obligations to the land, (Borrows 2010) it cannot be said that kinship mediates all aspects of social and political life in Indigenous communities. Colonialism has been very destructive to Indigenous kinship practices. As for actual Indige nous legal systems, despite the weakening of kinship, knowledge of the content of Indigenous legal traditions continues to exist in stories, oral traditions, books, scholarship, and most importantly, in the minds and memories of community Elders and leader s. Unfortunately, this knowledge does not mean Indigenous legal systems are the primary legal systems that guide communities. Instead, the Criminal Code of Canada applies to First Nations, Inuit, and Metis communities. Moreover, First Nations communities e xercise very limited legislative authority under the 13 Indian Act, which is a federal piece of legislation that gives the Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada a large amount of bureaucratic oversight over Indigenous communities (Borrows 2010) . Under this legislative framework, most laws or resolutions that a band council government passes must receive federal departmental approval, (Borrows 2010) which illustrates how the Indigenous -Canada relationship is still colonial, and therefore makes it difficult if not impossible for such communities to formally exercise their historic legal traditions. Revitalization and Future Considerations Despite the limited status of Indigenous legal traditions in relation to Canada's other legal systems, Indigenous legal traditions are currently being revitalized. The revitalization of Indigenous law is in the early stages of development, where knowledge of their content is being uncovered, recovered, and recorded. While knowledge recovery is not the same as law application and enforcement, it is still important, since as this knowledge is gathered over time, this collection of data and knowledge can act as a resource for communities as they explore the possibility of implementing their legal traditions in the future (Friedlan d 2012; Napolean and Friedland 2016). As Indigenous communities look to the future, they will inevitably be confronted with challenges, including, but not limited to, the different ways their legal systems will need to be adjusted to m eet contemporary human rights standards (Borrows 2010; Milward 2012; TRC 2015), as well as how their legal systems can address ongoing social problems, particularly violence against women and other vulnerable populations (Snyder 2014). L egal scholars have pointed out that Indigenous communities can implement their legal systems while simultaneously addressing these issues, since Indigenous laws can evolve and change over time (Borrows 2010; Borrows 2016 ; Napolean and Friedland 2014). That is, the authentici ty of contemporary Indigenous legal systems must not be judged and/or dismissed according to how well they reflect historic practices. Instead, the legitimacy of contemporary Indigenous legal traditions should be determined according to how well they addre ss community conflict, and if the local community accepts the lega l system as legitimate (Borrows 2010). In practice, this would have a more direct impact on the kinds of sanctions Indigenous communities would be able to deliver. Most drastically, communities would not be able to use execution as a penalty, since execution goes against international, as well as Canadian human rights standards (Milward 2012). However, communities may be able to punish certain offenders using corporal punishment, such as lashing or whipping, as long as the community consents to its use as a sanction in a referendum, or some other democratic process. According to legal scholar David Milward, corporal punishment could be an important sanction for Indigenous communities in light of the enormous amount of evidence demonstrating the ineffectiveness of prisons as a deterrent, the physical and psychological harm imprisonment has on individuals, and most importantly, the over -use of incarceration for Indigenous people (2012). However, considering corporal punish ment is considered contrary to human rights standards, Milward suggests that offenders could sign a waiver indicating they wish to waive their rights in that particular instance, and be subjected to corporal punishment instead ( 2012). According to Milward, the types of offences this would apply to would be highly speculative at the current moment, 14 but it is safe to suggest that corporal punishment as a sanction could apply to instances of assault and sexual assault, but also crim inal negligen ce causing bodily harm (2012). When looking to the future, Indigenous legal systems must be able to address the effect s of colonization that oftentimes manifest in communities. While there are numerous ways to measure the effect of colonizati on, it is arguably most evident and observable by looking at the levels of violence in Indigenous communities, especially the gendered and sexual violence directed against women, two -spirited people, and other vulnerable populat ions, especially children (D eer 2015; Snyder 2014). As was discussed earlier, in historical times, a series of cultural institutions and practices encouraged individuals to fulfill their kinship obligations, making gendered and sexual violence, especially within the family/community/ nation, truly abhorrent and revolting. In the future, Indigenous legal traditions must address this violence and restore balance in communities, meaning communities might potentially use harsh sanctions, such as corporal punishment alongside imprisonment, to demonstrate deterrence and denunciation (Deer 2015). In this instance, imprisonment would reflect how communities historically banished people that committed sexual violence, although imprisonment is almost always only a temporary form of \"banishment\". It would be up to communities to decide how they might address the temporariness of imprisonment. The Ongoing Relationship between Indigenous Legal Traditions and Restorative Justice The relationship between restorative justice and Indigenous legal tr aditions is more complex and nuanced than this report has indicated so far. While this report has strategically suggested a clear divide exists between \"restorative justice\" and \"Indigenous legal traditions\" as a way to emphasize that they need to be discu ssed and understood independently from each other, the truth is that these justice systems blend into each other. For example, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that Indigenous legal traditions influenced the early development of restorative justice p rograms. This includes influencing their underlying principles and values, to informing what programs should look like and how they might function (Archibald and Llewellyn 2006; Cameron 2005; Milward 2012; Tomporowski 2014). Likewise, there is evidence to suggest that the influence flows in the opposite direction, in that restorative justice has influenced the modern day implementation of some Indigenous justice programs (Milward 2012; Napolean and Friedland 2014). R estorative justice has informed some mode rn Indigenous legal processes, in that it has filled the gaps that colonization created (i.e. when Canadian officials suppressed Indigenous legal systems, most aggressively between the late 19th to early 20th centuries), meaning modern Indigenous justice p rojects, and possibly future justice projects, may take a more restorative approach, when historically they may have been more punitive and harsh (Deer 2015; Milward 2012). Going into the future, advocates for both restorative justice and Indigenous legal traditions should recognize the influence each approach to justice has had on the other, and use that awareness to establish a more consistent dialogue with each other. This is especially true for advocates of Indigenous legal systems, who can learn from the journey of restorative justice programs, when they went from being a rather obscure criminal justice strategy in the early 1970s (Tomporowski et al . 2011), to 15 becoming a legitimate alternative to the mainstream criminal justice process. Advocates for I ndigenous legal traditions can look at this experience to understand how restorative justice eventually became seen as a legitimate approach to crime and conflict, exploring what they did, who they talked to, etc. Ultimately, the relationship between resto rative justice and Indigenous legal traditions will continue to evolve, with each approach to justice likely to continue to influence the other. Conclusion This report has explored the relationship between restorative justice and Indigenous legal traditions. It discussed restorative justice and Indigenous legal systems, demonstrating that while these approaches to justice share similarities in terms of underlying principles, and even in terms of processes and protocols, they are ultimately very different. This difference comes down to proactive strategies mediated through kinship, the centrality of spirituality, and the use of sanctions and penalties. These are very material differenc es, and should not be ignored. This report also explored other is sues, including the support Indigenous legal traditions have received from international and domestic sources, although the United Nations did recognize and support restorative justice in 2003. This led into a discussion of the current status of Indigenous legal traditions in Canada, including how Indigenous communities are currently ordered and governed according to laws that were created by Canada. This report also discussed how Indigenous legal systems are being revived in light of this ongoing oppressio n, although this report recognized that Indigenous legal systems will likely need to evolve to meet contemporary needs, as well as international human rights standards. However, this report mentioned how future offenders might be able to sign a document to waive their rights, and be subjected to corporal punishment. Finally, this report discussed the evolving relationship between restorative justice and Indigenous legal traditions, suggesting that the relationship will continue to evolve as long as there is continued engagement, dialogue, critique, and support. To conclude this report, engagement between these approaches to justice is fine, if not inherently necessary, since according to many Indigenous worldviews, history and relationships are cyclical, and therefore the way Indigenous legal traditions can learn from restorative justice is simply a rotation of the circle of life. 16 Bibliography Anaya, James. 2007. \"Keynote Address: Indigenous Law and its Contribution to Global Pluralism.\" Indigenous Law J ournal 6 (1): 3- 12.
