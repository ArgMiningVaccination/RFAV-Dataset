While there will definitely be space to hold a New Year's Resolution, we'll focus most on accessing the spaciousness that holds limitless potential and beauty. This space naturally energizes intentions with the necessary present moment aliveness to maintain an intention's longevity and power (sankalpa shakti). We'll also explore techniques to build our reserves to maintain inner steadiness and clarity as waves come rolling in.
