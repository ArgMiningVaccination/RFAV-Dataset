Though we do not currently have an outbreak of whooping cough (pertussis) in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region there are many things we can do to protect our families and ourselves. Is Whooping Cough (Pertussis) Serious? In young babies less than a year of age the disease can be severe. It can cause pneumonia, apnea (periods of not breathing), seizures, and death. Pregnant women in their 3rd trimester are also considered at risk if they become ill with whooping cough (pertussis) because they can pass it on to their newborn infant. Even older children and adults who get sick with whooping cough (pertussis) can experience severe coughing spells that can last one to two months and symptoms are worse in people who are not vaccinated. For more information: How to Protect Yourself and Your Loved Ones The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from Whooping cough (pertussis) is to make sure you are up to date with immunization. Children receive pertussis vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age. Additional doses are given at 4 years of age and in Grade 8. All adults are eligible to receive one dose of pertussis containing vaccine after the age of 18 years. This is usually given in combination with Tetanus and Diptheria as a 'booster'. This vaccine is commonly referred to as \"Tdap\". Pregnant women who have not received a Tdap after the age of 18 years can now receive it during pregnancy once they are 26 weeks or further along in the pregnancy. Talk to your Primary Health Care provider. Where to get Vaccinated Children To book an appointment for your child call 306-766-7500 Adults The Tdap vaccine may be available through your Primary Health Care provider. If not, you can book an appointment at Public Health by calling 306-766-7500. For new moms who have just delivered, you may be offered the Tdap vaccine while in hospital if you have not received it earlier. What if I have Pertussis?
