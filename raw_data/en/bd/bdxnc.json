We're talking masks, baths and scrubs that use white ginger, turmeric, papaya, rice powder and many other natural ingredients. Our fave treatment: Try the Signature Visesa Herbal Healing Treatment. This signature package is inspired by Bali's traditional healing legacies and uses organic ingredients from Visesa's own permaculture gardens. Beginning with the massage, hot and herbal compresses are used with classic pressure techniques to relieve stress and improve overall wellness, beautifully followed by a body scrub, banana leaf wrap and a long soak in a herb-infused bubble bath.

It's a complete institution for health, fitness, lifestyle and wellness that we simply love. Our fave treatment: Try the Amala Holistic Massage.

As such, this special grass is used throughout the spa, including within the therapeutic treatments that use ancient Balinese healing rituals combined with freshly-plucked ingredients from the surrounding vegetation. Our fave treatment: Try the Darbha Detoxing Treatment. Beginning with a Don Base foot ritual and Toyam detoxing massage, this two-hour indulgence uses warm herbal compresses to release any muscle tension (perfect after a long flight to Bali) followed by a coffee exfoliation to give you a nice smooth glow.
