The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine whether measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination administered in early childhood was associated with asthma and allergic diseases at ages 5, 7 and 13 years in a birth cohort.METHODS: In the Faroe Islands, 640 children were followed from birth. Follow-up examinations at ages 5, 7 and 13 years included a physical examination and a maternal questionnaire about the child's health. At age 7, total and grass-specific IgE was quantified in the child's serum, and at age 13, the children underwent skin prick tests (SPT). The child's vaccination card was reviewed at examinations.RESULTS: At age 5, 533 of 555 children had been vaccinated for MMR. After confounder adjustment we found early life MMR vaccination to be associated with a two-third reduction in the odds of at age 5, and the substantially decreased odds of asthma were replicated at age 13 (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.08; 0.56). At age 7, serum IgE was reduced by 62.8% (CI 95%: -84.3%; -11.9%) in the vaccinated children. MMR vaccination was not significantly associated with allergic rhinoconjuctivitis symptoms, eczema, or SPT reactions at age 13.CONCLUSIONS: MMR vaccination early in life may have a protective effect against allergy at least up to age 7 and against asthma through age 13 years.

PEDIATRICS 2003 Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology 2015 The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of preventive immunization on the incidence of allergies in Poland.18617 (53.8% female, 24.2% 6-7 years old, 25.4% 13-14 years old, 50.4% 20-44 years old) were selected by stratified cluster sampling method in 8 cities and 1 rural area. 4783 of whom underwent objective outpatient screening assessments. Study subjects were evaluated for any association between preventive immunization against rubella, measles, typhoid fever, smallpox and incidence of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma.There was no increased risk of allergy incidence in the majority of vaccinated subjectsagainst rubella, measles, typhoid fever, or smallpox (OR from 1.34 (p<0.0001) with 95% CI from 0.27-0.65 to 1.19-1.50). Slightly increased risk of asthma was after vaccination against typhoid (OR=1.27; p<0.0001) and smallpox (OR=1.21; p=0.02). The risk of atopic dermatitis (AD) was also evaluated following vaccinati... Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology 2006 1998 Antibody titres were determined in 102 Thai infants who were vaccinated at 9-months of age during the respiratory disease season. The symptom densities of illnesses at or following vaccination, including rhinorrhea and diarrhea, were significantly lower among seroconverters, although the simple presence or absence of specific symptoms was not significantly related to seroconversions. Logistic regression indicated that neutralization test antibody titres below the median titre of 1:80 following vaccination were significantly more frequent among those with rhinorrhea when vaccinated and among those with diarrhea after vaccination. Compared with a referent group without these symptoms, titres were lower in those who had rhinorrhea when vaccinated, rhinorrhea during the first week post vaccination, and diarrhea in either of the two follow-up weeks. Illnesses concurrent or subsequent to measles vaccination adversely affected antibody responses in these study objects. Clinical & Experimental Allergy 2009 Epidemiology and Infection 2012 SUMMARYPassive immunity against measles decreases during the first months of life. The objective of this study was to determine titres of measles antibodies in children aged 9-14 months and their mothers before vaccination, and the children's response to vaccination. Blood samples were collected by capillary puncture before and 28 days after vaccination. Samples were obtained between February and June 2007 during an ongoing measles outbreak. Titres of specific measles IgG antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seroconversion was defined as the presence of antibodies after vaccination in subjects without antibodies before vaccination. Maternal antibodies were present in 37\u00b77% of all 69 children included and in 45\u00b71% of children aged 9 months. Of the 51 children in whom a second sample was obtained, 31 (60\u00b78%) were seronegative before vaccination and 61\u00b73% seroconverted. Interference of maternal antibodies was 30%. Advancing the first dose of measles vacc... Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable.
