Her practice approach involves applying multiple methods of pain management, including those of integrative medicine, which combines Western methods with complementary therapies. Reetz has a special focus on techniques that allow the body to regenerate and heal, including acupuncture, nutritional strategies, therapeutic yoga and mind-body medicine (a holistic approach that works with mental, emotional, social, spiritual and other factors affecting an individual). She also cares for patients who want help managing pain without opioids or through buprenorphine therapy. Reetz's current research interests include integrative pain medicine and dextrose-based injection therapies, which aim to stimulate healing by injecting points involved in chronic muscle and joint pain. Reetz earned her medical degree at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and completed a residency in family medicine - which emphasized social justice advocacy, compassionate care and personal growth - at Sutter Health. She also completed a fellowship in pain medicine at UCSF.
