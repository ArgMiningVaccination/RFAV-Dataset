BELZER, AND LISSA EDMOND September 28 - October 3, 2023 Join Diana Winston, Leslie Booker, and Marvin G. Belzer, and Lissa Edmond (movement) for a five-night silent retreat in the beautiful natural setting of the Big Bear Retreat Center, only two and a half hours from Los Angeles. We will spend our days deepening our meditation practice in the service of cultivating wisdom and compassion needed to transfer out to our lives. As we settle our minds, supported by nature, we can see ourselves and the world with deeper clarity and allow our inner wisdom to emerge. The retreat will include sitting and walking meditation with ongoing guidance, lecture and instruction from the teachers. We will also have an opportunity to practice cultivating positive emotions, mindful speaking and listening, mindful eating, as well as experience the depth of stillness that can come through an extended period of practice. This silent retreat is suitable for beginning or experienced students. It meets the requirements for the MARC IPP and TMF programs.
