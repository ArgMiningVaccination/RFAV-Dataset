Forty if you're driving during rush hour. Let's take the trip: From the heart of caffeinated, driven downtown Seattle to the metaphysical belt of the city: Northeast 65th Street. Life moves to a different rhythm here. Slow that power walk. Pause. Stop and smell the (essential oil of) roses. Here, what matters most isn't money or deals or number of phone calls returned. What matters is finding your center and your connection to the universe. And if you're feeling as though your universe is spinning uncontrollably faster - as if someone had pushed the puree button on the blender that is your life - well, maybe that's why places like this exist. No rays of light beam down, no signs proclaim this neighborhood the Metaphysical Belt, the Holistic Health Center or the White Light Ghetto, as it has variously been called. There are only grayish-wood single-family houses, a few apartments and some nondescript one- and two-story stores. But look closer, on and around Northeast 65th Street from Eighth Avenue Northeast to 25th Avenue Northeast: There's the AYU Natural Medicine Clinic, Northwest Alternative Healing Center, Seattle Institute of Oriental Medicine, East West Bookshop, Ananda Church of Self-Realization, Zenith Supplies, Mandala Books, Healing Arts Studio, Whole Foods Market, Puget Consumers Co-Op, The Herbalist, Evergreen Natural Health Clinic, The Center for Yoga . . . \"Seattle is the metaphysical center of the Northwest, and 65th Street is the center of that universe,\" says Deverick Martin, publisher of The New Times, a free monthly guide to the Northwest metaphysical/holistic health community. \"It's like a vortex that draws people in.\" The vortex seems to be exerting greater pull these days. \"We're living in an era of unprecedented change,\" Martin says. \"Our values are changing, we're exposed to more information, stability is not happening. So there's a greater call to explore what our spiritual essence is.\" Perhaps Newton said it best: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The faster our lives spin, the more we seek a still center. A route to realization Whatever path you choose toward your center, you're likely to find it on 65th Street. Books, tapes, videos. Tibetan Buddhism, Siberian shamanism, a Church of Self-Realization. Meditation, yoga, chanting. Psychics, palm readers, astrologists. Reiki, rolfing, reflexology. Acupuncture, colonics, detoxification. Naturopathy, homeopathy, aromatherapy. Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism. Even the occasional labyrinth, where you can literally walk to your center. In East West Bookshop, on the corner of 65th and Roosevelt, some 20 people at a time are walking through a makeshift labyrinth. It's a sign of the booming New Age times that the store is celebrating its recent move from a 2,500-square-foot room to a 4,000-square-foot building a block away. Now there's even more space to display books about sacred altars, videos on healing crystals, and all the paraphernalia of spirituality in the early days of the 21st century: meditation cushions, Tibetan singing bowls, prayer candles. The open house was held on a drizzly Saturday. Still, the faithful came - some from several towns away. It's hard to find a good labyrinth these days. A labyrinth, in this context, is like a maze but with no dead ends. The path can be marked by low hedges, or painted on a large canvas, or, in the case at East West, designed in 45 minutes with a roll of masking tape. You are always able to see the center. The idea is this: You walk in with an open heart, and perhaps a request for divine guidance. You pace slowly as the path winds. When you get to the center, you pause, reflect. When you're ready, you walk slowly back out, rejoining your life, having reclaimed your center and carrying it with you. \"There's something about a labyrinth that speaks so deeply to the heart and soul,\" explains Melissa Gayle West, designer of East West's temporary labyrinth and author of \"Exploring the Labyrinth: A Guide for Healing and Spiritual Growth.\" \"It's the idea that it's a journey and that you have to trust the journey and that there is a center. We forget about that in the busyness of our lives.\" Not bad for 45 minutes and a roll of masking tape. \"The second I walked into it, I felt calm,\" says Kathy Frachey, a 34-year-old executive assistant from Seattle, who came to East West specifically to walk the labyrinth. \"I gained real insight about how fear was keeping me from going forward in life. At one point, as I was walking out from the center, all of a sudden I thought: `Am I walking the right way?' Then I thought: `I just have to trust the path, that it's leading me the right way.' Also at the center: money Finding your spiritual center is big business these days. (The universe is strange like that.) It's worth at least $44 billion, according to one industry estimate - and that doesn't even include all the vitamins, books by Deepak Chopra and aromatherapy candles now carried by the mainstream likes of Barnes & Noble and Long's. Since the 1960s, the metaphysical movement has grown steadily. (Metaphysics involves the realm of things beyond the physical or material. Metaphysical practices include the study of those disciplines that help its practitioners reach a higher awareness.) Then, about five years ago, local retailers say, it began to boom - and seep into the mainstream. Susan McGinnis, manager of East West Bookshop, thinks she knows why: In moving from a production-oriented culture to one driven by ideas and creativity, she says, people are more open to new ideas. And in an age of affluence, people are finding materialism isn't always nirvana. \"They yearn for something deeper,\" she says. In Seattle, that yearning seems to find expression in avenues other than traditional religion. The city has a reputation for having one of the lowest levels of church attendance but one of the highest levels of interest in things spiritual, says Steve Towles, co-minister at Seattle Unity, a Christian church that embraces practices - such as chanting in sanskrit and Native American vision quests - from other traditions. \"People in Seattle are independent,\" says Padma McGilloway, minister of the Seattle branch of Ananda Church of Self-Realization, a spiritual practice based on the teachings of a Hindu guru. \"Less-traditional spiritual paths draw people who are independent, who want to experience things for themselves. We offer actual techniques that people can practice, not just inspiring thoughts. The more these techniques are becoming known, the more people are attracted to them.\" While by no means holding a monopoly on places spiritual, 65th Street has seen a lot of that growth. One theory: Supposedly, a large number of ley lines - lines that correspond to the Earth's magnetic field and give people feelings of positive energy - converge in this neighborhood, says Chuck Pettis, the Bellevue-based author of \"Secrets of Sacred Space\" who mapped Seattle's ley lines. Or maybe it's the lemming effect. \"It's like shoe stores,\" says The New Times' Martin. \"If you're selling shoes in a neighborhood where there are a lot of shoe stores, you'll do well because people automatically go there when they need shoes.\" Seattle is also a leader in natural and holistic health. Austin-based Whole Foods Market, the nation's top-selling natural and organic-food grocery chain, chose to open its first store in the Northwest five months ago at 65th and Roosevelt. At 50,000 square feet, it's now the country's biggest natural-food supermarket, joining a neighborhood that already has the PCC. The January/February issue of Natural Health magazine named Seattle the healthiest city in America, based on rankings such as the number of health-food stores, acupuncturists and holistic veterinarians per capita. It doesn't hurt that the Seattle area is home to Bastyr University, one of the world's foremost colleges for natural medicine. Founded in 1978, the university expanded from its Wallingford neighborhood three years ago, moving to a 50-acre campus in Kenmore. Holistic/natural health clinics along 65th Street are seeing a similar jump. Part of this boom is no doubt attributable to a state law - the only one of its kind in the nation - requiring insurance companies to cover alternative services such as acupuncture, massage therapy and naturopathic medicine, under many circumstances. Western science's verdict on the efficacy of some of these practices may still be out. But much of the public's is already in. \"The phone rings off the hook all the time now,\" says Vivek Shanbhag, medical director of the AYU Natural Medicine Clinic, which treats about 100 patients a week with a range of services including ayurvedic medicine (an Indian tradition that divides people into three basic mind-body temperaments). AYU has doubled the number of patients each year since 1997, when it moved from Edmonds to 65th and Eighth Avenue Northeast. All of which makes sense to Rebecca Castelli, a 28-year-old Seattle actress who's seeing Shanbhag for digestion problems. Shanbhag has typed Castelli as a predominantly Vata mind-body type - usually quick of movement and mind, thinner and more prone to worry and anxiety. His treatment plan involves everything from supplements (acidophilus, enzymes, multivitamins) to massages and saunas. It seems to be effective, says Castelli, who began treatment three weeks ago. Or maybe something more than the mere treatment itself is at work. \"Modern, Western medicine can be pretty impersonal,\" Castelli says. \"The doctors don't have much time to spend with you. In natural health, they spend an hour with you, treating you like a whole person and not just treating the symptoms.\" The business of metaphysics and holistic health thrives, in other words, in part on our increasing yearning to connect. Spanning time and space One of the remarkable things about this time and place we live in is the ability to pick and choose with whom, what and how we make our connections - even if those ties span millennia and miles. So it is that Seattleite Jan Vanysslestyne finds her deepest connections to herself and her surroundings by practicing one of the most ancient of spiritual traditions, as carried on by a small tribe some 5,000 miles away in Siberia. Vanysslestyne, 46, is co-owner of Mandala Books, a store dedicated to the study of ancient and Eastern spiritual traditions, located at Northeast 64th Street and Ninth Avenue Northeast. She also is co-director of what is, as far as she knows, the only school of Siberian shamanism outside of Siberia. Six years ago, Vanysslestyne arranged to have an Ulchi tribal member give a talk in Seattle. The 2,500-strong Ulchi live near the Amur River in eastern Siberia. Back then, the Soviet Union was in the midst of glasnost, ethnographers around the world were salivating at their first opportunities to study indigenous tribes, and Vanysslestyne got curious. The tribe's wisdom keeper, shaman Nadyezhda Duvan, came and visited Vanysslestyne's \"I'm kind an oddball,\" Vanysslestyne readily admits. \"I have animal pelts and whatnot hanging on the walls. When Nadyezhda came over, she said: `This is just like my home! Do all Americans live like you?' I knew then: This was it. I had found my people.\" Vanysslestyne, whose childhood in Hawaii was influenced by Taoism, loved the almost pure Taoist aspects of Ulchi beliefs. She loved the reverence they held for everything around them. She loved the fact they were animistic and viewed rivers, roads, trees, even plastic cups as having spirit and something to teach. She loved how that made everything around her so alive, prodding her to stay mindful at all times. And she loved the Ulchis' connection to the Earth, feeling as they did that human beings were but guests in this world, and that their proper role was to be grateful guardians. Now her group - called Amba (an Ulchi word for Siberian tiger) - numbers about 15 and meets two or three times a week to learn Ulchi drumming, folk arts, traditions, legends. On a recent weekend, some 10 Amba members were at Magnuson Park, performing the Spring Festival to Honor the Water Spirits, traditionally held each year when the salmon are about to return from the ocean. They drummed a rhythm to call forth the seal spirit on their handmade, 20-inch-diameter circle drums. Vanysslestyne asked a willow tree for permission to take some branches. She placed the branches a foot apart off the shores of Lake Washington, to form the spirit gate. The oldest woman in the group launched through the branches a homemade foot-long birch boat, laden with offerings to the spirits. Then they beat the \"bear listening\" rhythm, swirling as they tapped, thumping one another's drums every few beats, like a tightly choreographed acoustic Double Dutch jump-rope team. Darkness had fallen by the time the Amba members returned from Magnuson Park. East West Bookshop was still open. About 600 people had visited during that open-house weekend. A few dozen still lingered. A woman was looking for a statue of Kuan Yin - a Buddhist goddess of mercy. Even in the dark, you can find your center on 65th Street. Janet I.

Seattle ranked first in the number of acupuncturists, holistic veterinarians, vegetarian restaurants, massage therapists and green space per capita. Some of the magazine's findings: Number of acupuncturists: 169 Number 89,496 Number of 65 store: 8,261 Number 16,272 Number studios: 16 Number of people per studio: 33,561 The New Age money machine: -- Americans spent at least $44 billion on metaphysical-holistic goods in 1998 (estimate by New Editions International Ltd., a Sedona, Ariz., marketing company). -- They spent more than $27 billion on alternative therapies (a 1997 figure from The Journal of the American Medical Association). Alternative medicine: -- Visits to alternative practitioners rose by almost 50 percent from 1990 to 1997, reports JAMA. -- At local Bastyr University's clinics and dispensary, visits were up 39 percent in one year to 48,496 (1998-'99), with another another 26 percent increase projected for this year. More students are enrolling, too: 900 last year, 1,000 "}
