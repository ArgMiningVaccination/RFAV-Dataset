DOSE/ADMINISTRATION DOSE/ADMINISTRATION DOSE/ADMINISTRATION Adult PRIMARY SERIES Adult PRIMARY SERIES Adult PRIMARY SERIES - Should be given before the onset of [influenza](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540285/all/Influenza)in the community; vaccines are usually available middle to the end of August. The preference is to vaccinate by the end of October. - For adults living with HIV - Annual seasonal influenza vaccination is indicated for all people with HIV per the general vaccination series. Do not use the live attenuated (Flumist) when the CD4 count is < 200 cells/mm3.

Pediatric PRIMARY SERIES Pediatric PRIMARY SERIES Pediatric PRIMARY SERIES Should be given before the onset of influenza in the community; vaccines are usually available middle to the end of August. The preference is to vaccinate by the end of October. Children: ages 6 months - 8 years, preferably before the start of the influenza season. See [table](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540287/all/Influenza_vaccine#d19498051e2). - Administer 2 doses 4 weeks apart if any of the following: - Patient's first season of influenza immunization - The patient received 1 dose of quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1, preceding the current influenza season. - If vaccination history is unknown - Ages 2-8 years: no preference for any vaccine for healthy children without contraindications - See [table](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540287/all/Influenza_vaccine#d377001779e3)for age and vaccine-specific dosing. Pediatric BOOSTER Pediatric BOOSTER Pediatric BOOSTER - Required each season due to reformulation based on recently circulating influenza strains. ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS GENERAL GENERAL GENERAL - Intranasal LAIV vaccine is not recommended in children < 24 months of age because of the increased risk of hospitalization and wheezing. COMMON COMMON COMMON - IIV: - Soreness at the injection site, usually > 2 days in ~30% - Injection site reaction (mild transient) was reported in 36% of pts receiving Fluzone High-Dose (compared to 24% with standard Fluzone). - LAIV: runny nose/nasal congestion; the incidence of headache, cough, and sore throat were comparable to placebo. OCCASIONAL OCCASIONAL OCCASIONAL - IIV: fever and malaise: 1.1% reported moderate to severe fevers with Fluzone High-Dose (compared to 0.3% with standard Fluzone). - LAIV: wheezing (especially in children 6-11 months). Avoid Flumist in children aged < 5 years with possible reactive airway disease (e.g., recurrent wheezing or a recent wheezing episode). RARE RARE RARE - ALL: - Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome: estimate 8 excess cases of GBS per 1 million vaccinations. This rate from the pandemic vaccine is similar to that found in seasonal influenza vaccines. - Allergy: hives, angioedema, asthma. - Ocular and respiratory symptoms: red eyes, cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, facial swelling, and sore throat (associated with a formulation available in Canada during the 2000-2001 season). - IIV: febrile seizure reported in 5-9 cases/1,000 vaccinated children < 5 yrs old, with most seizures occurring < 3 yrs old when children received IIV (CSL Biotherapies) in Australia. VACCINE/DRUG and radiation): do not co-administer LAIV. May theoretically increase the risk of disseminated infection. - Can be co-administered with the [pneumococcal vaccine](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540438/all/Pneumococcal_vaccines), as ( [Pfizer BioNTech](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540759/all/BNT162b2_COVID_19_Vaccine__BioNTech_Pfizer_), [Moderna](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540760/all/Moderna_COVID_19_Vaccine), [J&J](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540729/all/Johnson_&_Johnson_COVID_19_Vaccine)) - Reports of the vaccine inhibiting the clearance of warfarin, theophylline, and phenytoin, although controlled studies have shown inconsistent results. - The attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine should not be administered until 48 hours after cessation of antiviral compounds. Antiviral drugs should not be administered until 2 weeks after the administration of the live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine. CONTRAINDICATIONS CONTRAINDICATIONS CONTRAINDICATIONS - IIV: allergy to eggs or prior severe allergic reaction or fever > 40\u00b0C. No contraindication if only prior local reaction. - Note: if an \"egg-allergic\" individual can normally eat baked goods, egg allergy is unlikely to be significant regarding receipt of the influenza vaccine. - LAIV: a history of hypersensitivity to vaccine components, including eggs or egg products, children and adolescents (5-17 years of age) receiving aspirin, individuals who have a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome, and individuals with immune deficiency diseases. - Children aged 6 to 12 months may have a higher rate of wheezing and hospitalization with LAIV. IMMUNE RESPONSE IMMUNE RESPONSE IMMUNE RESPONSE - 6 months-8yrs: 86% had antibody response with 2 doses, but only 27% with 1 dose. - ACIP emphasizes the importance of administering 2 doses of vaccine to all children aged 6 months--8 years if they have not been vaccinated previously at any time with either live, attenuated influenza vaccine. - LAIV: doses separated by >6 weeks. - IIV: doses separated by >4 weeks. - ACIP emphasizes the importance of administering 2 doses of vaccine to all children aged 6 months--8 years if they have not been vaccinated previously at any time with either live, attenuated influenza vaccine. - Adults >65 years: Fluzone High-Dose elicited significantly higher hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against all three influenza virus strains. The clinical effectiveness of the High-Dose Fluzone vaccine compared to the standard Fluzone vaccine appears more efficacious; however, no preferential recommendation (yet) is made for high-dose Fluzone over standard-dose IIV. CLINICAL EFFICACY CLINICAL EFFICACY CLINICAL EFFICACY - Vaccine efficacy depends on the match of epidemic and vaccine strains; has been consistently well-matched over the last decade. Prevention efficacy: - Young adults or healthy elderly: ~70%. - Elderly in nursing homes: 30-40%, but reduces [influenza](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540285/all/Influenza)mortality by 80%. - Vaccine efficacy may be decreased in the elderly and immunosuppression. - High-dose vaccine (age > 65 yrs): relative efficacy, 24.2% compared to SIV, suggesting enhanced protection with HD vaccine. - In adults, intranasally administered live attenuated vaccine resulted in a 40.9% reduction in febrile upper respiratory tract illnesses during a season with a poor match of epidemic and vaccine influenza strains. OTHER INFORMATION OTHER INFORMATION OTHER INFORMATION - Estimated vaccination coverage remains < 50% among all patients for whom routine annual vaccination is recommended, including young children and adults with risk factors for influenza complications, healthcare personnel (HCP), and pregnant women. [Influenza](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540285/all/Influenza)is a major infectious cause of death in the U.S. (3,000 to 80,000 annually); most are elderly, in nursing homes, or have chronic diseases. - Providing the vaccine to healthy adults generally reduces URIs and employee absenteeism, but conflicting data on cost-effectiveness. - Healthcare workers should be vaccinated to protect patients and other healthcare workers; they must avoid high-risk pt contact if given FluMist x 7d post-administration. - LAIV is shipped refrigerated and should be kept refrigerated (35-46\u00b0F). - Children with reactive airway disease, persons with underlying medical conditions with a higher risk for influenza complications, children aged 6-23 months, and persons aged >49 years should not receive LAIV. - Serious flu-related complications have been reported in obese patients and post-partum women. - Flu vaccination in the era of [COVID-19](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540747/all/Coronavirus_COVID_19__SARS_CoV_2_) - Influenza vaccination to individuals > 6 months of age to reduce the prevalence of influenza may reduce symptoms that might be confused with [COVID-19](./view/Johns_Hopkins_ABX_Guide/540747/all/Coronavirus_COVID_19__SARS_CoV_2_), and increased influenza vaccination may mitigate the severity of influenza illness, reduce hospitalizations and reduce intensive care unit admissions - For those who have acute illness with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease, consider delaying influenza vaccination until acute illness has resolved. - Guidance is available at [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html) - Influenza vaccination to individuals > 6 months of age to reduce the prevalence of influenza may reduce symptoms that might be confused with Basis for recommendation Basis for recommendation Basis for recommendation - Grohskopf LA, Blanton LH, Ferdinands JM, et al.
