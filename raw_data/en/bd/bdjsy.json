The arrival of a third wave of COVID -19 in Alberta and other Canadian provinces, driven by more contagious COVID -19 Variants of Concern (VOCs) has shown we need to assess and adjust vaccination rollout to best reduce the rate of disease transmission There are hundreds of Albertan communities with very high rates of infection, in the highest 25% infection rates worldwide. There are currently 11 communities in Alberta with both the highest rates of active COVID -19 cases, and lowest rates of vaccination. These communities often have both a younger population that is not yet elig ible for vaccination, and a local industry and work patterns that do not support working from home. This review summarizes the available evidence on whether vaccinating people based on how likely they are to catch or pass on COVID -19, rather than on their individual risk of dying may be helpful in pandemic control. KEY FINDINGS Almost all of the evidence on this topic comes from modelling stu dies that have not been peer -reviewed. Most of these models assumed that vaccination campaigns were starting from scr atch (ie. nobody is vaccinated yet) and that there is extremely high disease transmission - this is not the case in Alberta. Modelling from the Ontario Science Advisory Table, which has a situation similar to Alberta's, s uggests that in Ontario an additional 10-15% of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths could be prevented by directing vaccines to areas with a high rate of COVID -19 transmission When all of the studies are considered together, the evidence s uggests that once many people at high risk of severe outcomes have been vaccinated, shifting to vaccinating people who live or work in areas where disease transmission is high can reduce the overall number of infections and reduce severe outcomes like hospitalizations and ICU admissions. This also would protec t the health care system capacity to provide care for all . This strategy could also help make sure that people who might have a hard time getting the vaccine have the same chance as everybody else. RECOMMENDATIONS A strategy of dir ecting more vaccine supply to areas with high levels of disease transmission for all ages eligible for the vaccine should be strongly considered. Vaccination campaigns should be resource d to make it as easy as possible for people to get their shot Outreach should be done to engage with those who are skeptical o r hesitant about vaccines. Additional guidance: Although there are no COVID examples of this strategy, r ing vaccination (where you vaccinate a case's contacts and the contact's contacts) 4 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 has been effective in the past to control some diseases including Smallpox and Ebola. This strategy could be evaluated/considered if public health resources are availabl e and with rapid and complete contact tracing in place. The best use of this strategy is likely in areas with low transmission and new outbreaks, particularly in non B.1.1.7 VOC outbreaks to potentially help prevent VOC surges becoming established. 5 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 Authorship and Committee Members Name Contribution Rachael Erdmann Writing - evidence screening and extraction; draft preparation and editing Nicole Loroff Research Librarian Lynora Saxinger Primary scientific reviewer David Campbell, Andr\u00e9 Corriveau Manns & Lynora Saxinger Scientific Advisory Group chairs (oversight and leadership responsibility) John Conly, Andre Corriveau, Alexander Doroshenko, Shelley Duggan, Elizabeth Melissa Potestio, Jeremy Slobodan, Brandie Walker, Nathan Zelyas Discussion, revision, and approval of document \u00a9 2021, Alberta Health Services, COVID -19 Scientific Advisory Group This copyright work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial -NoDerivative 4.0 International license .

What transmission/ exposure -risk vaccination strategies have been proposed or utilized to reduce transmission of COVID -19, alongside medical -risk prioritization strategies? 2. In the face of scarce vaccination supply, is there evidence to support the use of exposure- risk vaccination strategies alongside or instead of medical -risk strat egies to reduce community COVID -19 transmission? Context Canadian vaccination recommendations have been developed by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), a pan- Canadian, interdisciplinary group with expertise in pediatrics, infectious d iseases, immunology, pharmacy, nursing, epidemiology, pharmacoeconomics, social science and public health . Their mandate is to provide evidence- based recommendations that consider economics, ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability . o COVID -19 vaccine rollout across Canadian provinces has been largely focused on protecting individuals at high risk of severe COVID -19 outcomes , with all provinces and one territory incorporating age based risk (a proxy for medical risk of severe outcomes) and prioritization of long - term care residents . In addition, healthcare workers who work in long term care or who directly care for COVID -19 patients have been prioritized in all provinces in keeping with NACI guidance. Otherwise, prioritiza tion is heterogen eous: o 6 jurisdictions include various \"frontline\" or essential workers beyond healthcare workers o Beyond age based medical risk, several provinces have prioritized those with specific medical risks, a group which has been variably defined o There has been variable prioritizing of First Nations and Metis communities and remote communities o Essential worker groups have been priorit ized in many provinces, but these groups have been variably defined (eg: tho se who travel for work, congregate house d workers, food plant workers, and teachers ) The development of a \"third wave\" of COVID -19 with extremely high case rates in several provinces , particularly Alberta, has highlighted the importance of strategies to reduce case transmission, and optimal vacc ine rollout strategies have been identified as important to achieve this goal Areas in Alberta with a high number of active COVID -19 cases often have lower vaccination rates that are insufficient to mitigate viral transmission. This may be due to a combination of factor s such as vaccine eligibility, population distribution, age distribution, local industry , and variable rates of vaccine hesitancy in communities across Alberta. There are currently (as of April 27, 2021) 11 communities in Alberta with active case rates above 400/100 000 and vaccine coverage 20%; and 10 communities with active case rates above 600/100 000 and vaccine coverage 7 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 below 20%. More detailed information and high- level analysis is available in the appendix . Transmission/exposure- risk vaccination strategies prioritize populations or communities where individuals are at high risk of acquiring the virus and transmitting it to others (and thus contribute to incidence and total number of cases) , but these individuals are not necessarily at the highest risk of severe outcomes. Some jurisdictions, such as O ntario, have recently adjusted their vaccine prioritization scheme to target neighborhoods and regions with high disease transmission. The current Alberta prioritization strategy , focusing on prevention of morbidity and mortality by prioritizing those vulnerable due to age and medical risk, was largely developed before the sharp increase in COVID -19 variants of concern (VOC), which are more easily transmissible . The current rates of infection in older age groups shows evidence of a protective effect f rom this vaccination strategy with much lower rates than in the second wave. Developing a strategy that balances maximal speed of immunization given availability of vaccines, complexity of operationalization, and the possible benefits of risk based strategies on overall infection rates is timely. Vaccination is expected to reduce community transmission by decreasing the number of susceptible people. Information on COVID -19 transmission following vaccination has been previously reviewed by the Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) and COVID -END, with current data suggesting that vaccination reduces transmission by reducing the number of active cases (including asymptomatic cases) and reducing the infectiousness of those infected. Preliminary data suggests that COVID -19 positive individuals who have been vaccinated may be less likely to transmit based on virologic parameters. Key Messages from the Evidence Summary The majority of identified evidence about transmission/exposure risk vaccination strategies is in preprint manuscripts ; the included articles are largely composed of modelling studies and grey literature. Many jurisdictions that are comparable to Alberta are moving towards prioritizing individuals with a high risk of COVID -19 transmission/exposure, suggesting that this is a feasible option . These jurisdictions include Ontario, New Zealand, China, Australia, Ireland, Hong Kong, Germany, Austria, Malta, Norway, Poland, and Spain. Potential s trategies for targeting populations with high transmission/ exposure in the literature can be designed according to: o Geographic \"hotspot \" identification: vaccines are allocated to geographic areas, communities or neighborhoods with high rates of infection o Occupational risk (essential w orkers): vaccines are allocated to individuals who have a high number of contacts due to the nature of their occupation and who cannot work from home , as well as the family members of these individuals 8 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 o Age-targeting of the population at risk : vaccines are allocated to younger adults (typically aged 18- 49), as this population tends to have a higher degree of soci al interaction than older adults o Overall number of social contacts : vaccines are allocated to individuals with a high number of social contacts, regardless of age o Housing situation : vaccines are allocated to individuals whose living arrangements increase t heir risk of exposure and transmission (such as those who are unstably housed, those living in multigenerational houses, or those with roommates or other shared accommodation) o Ring vaccination: following identification of a positive case, vaccines are adm inistered to two generations of contacts (ie. the case's contacts, and the contact's contacts) Individuals at high risk of infection and consequent transmission should be considered in the broader context of prioritization and with attention to the ability for the groups to be identified and encouraged to vaccinate. Considerations include their place in the existing prioritization scheme; risk of viral transmission ; which prioritization categories might intersect, and the logistical challenges of prioritizing these groups especially groups identified by occupation or network contact numbers, The most relevant models for Alberta are likely from the Ontario Science Table model (Mishra et al, 2021) and the model by Mulberry (preprint). These models use R 0 values less than 1.5) which would suggest that ongoing NPI (nonpharmaceutical interventions) are maintained as needed to control transmission during rollout, and use Canadian population data. T he Ontario Science Table model assumes that 80% of those with age -based risk (ie. over 60 years old) are already vaccinated when allocation changes to prioritize hotspots. As such, when highly vulnerable populations have had good vaccine coverage, switching to a transmission reduction strategy may reduce overall case rates and also reduce morbidity and mortality. Evidence from Ontario has highlighted the equity imbalance associated with a strictly age-based (ie. medical -risk) vaccination strategy - Ontario neighborhoods where residents have the lowest risk of SARS -CoV-2 infections are 1 .5 times more likely to have received at least one COVID -19 vaccine dose by April 5, 2021, as compared to residents of neighborhoods with the highest risk of SARS - CoV-2 infections . Modelling vaccine redistribution to these high- risk areas suggests that at 70% vaccine coverage of adults (16-59), an additional 14% of hospitalizations and ICU admissions and 11% of deaths could be prevented compared to the current vaccination strategy . One modelling study described vaccinat ing all front -line workers with AstraZeneca, while simultaneously distributing the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech & Moderna) by age/medical risk to the general population . This study suggested that this strategy could reduc e overall mortality and healthcare utilization as front-line workers were assumed to be more willing to be vaccinated. This approach may have real or perceived ethical and equity issues that must be considered. 9 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 True r ing vaccination (as has been done to help eradicate S mallpox in the past) of succeeding generations of contacts was modelled in one COVID -19 modelling study, however, this strategy requires rapid complete contact tracing with rapid test results , and vaccination infrastructure t o safely vaccinate contacts who should be quarantining to mitigate forward transmission and may not be feasible . In addition, ring vaccination is not usually prioritized in a high transmission setting , but can be considered in settings with very low transmission and new introduction of disease, or potentially in elimination phases. The specific results from modeling studies are highly dependent on the model inputs for population structure, existing natural immunity, vaccine coverage, vaccine efficacy, vaccination rate, transmission rate, public health measures , timing, and vaccine uptake. The robustness of existing data means that the general concepts can be applied to these research questions, but the magnitude of effect when applied to Alberta may differ. Many models assumed an unvaccinated population and a reproduction number 2 (as seen in early epidemics without public health mea sures in place), limiting applicability to Alberta where about 25% of the population (mostly those with age-based and medical risk ) have been vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy was incorporated into most, but not all models. For most models, population coverage was one of the model outputs and was assumed to be between 6 0-80% in most studies . In studies that assumed vaccine hesitancy, estimates of uptake were approximately 70% . The goals of the vaccine campaign - whether the focus is to minimize new cases, deaths, years of life lost, healthcare utilization, or to maximize value for money - will determine the optimal allocation strategy when vaccine supply is scarce . In most models (where at baseline, the population was unvaccinated) , vaccination based on transmission/exposure risk is the most effective strategy for reducing incidence and maximizing value for money, while vaccinating based on medical risk is the most effective for reducing overall mortality and healthcare utilization . In the current context given good vaccine coverage of those at higher risk in Alberta, switching to a rapid strategic transmission risk model may be an effectiv e strategy to help contain Wave 3 and potentially slow the spread of COVID -19 VOC . An ethical analysis of vaccine allocation supported that transmission risk models may be supported in the context of maximiz ing societal benefi t in resource scarcity. In the case of COVID -19 vaccines, maximum benefit could potentially be achieved by prioritizing childr en and young people based on an assumption that they tend to get infected more frequently, to remain infected for longer, and can therefore be significant vectors of disease transmission to the elderly and other vulnerable groups . This is slightly less relevant when looking at hybrid models where medically vulnerable individuals have already been vaccinated. Multiple models support that vaccinating younger adults (i.e. of working age) or allocating vaccines to geographically identified hotspots can effecti vely mitigate disease incidence. The two main risk prioritization strategies to consider therefore are: 10 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 1) Prioritizing vaccines for essential workers , who are generally 18- 59 years old, may be an effective way to reduce mortality, minimize years of life lost (YLL), and minimize infections , but does not have a substantial effect on severe complications from COVID -19. This strateg y is less costly and more effective than vaccinating all adults randomly. Operationalizing this strategy may be complex (defining target groups, outreach) which could potentially result in an overall slower vaccine rollout with more communication challenges. 2) Targeting geographic hotspots has been shown to reduce disease transmission and improve the equitable distribution of vaccine. In many regions this may also encompass important essential worker groups. Further models from the Philippines and theoretical modeling suggest that allocating vaccines based on disease transmission rate can reduce deaths and substantially reduce infections. Committee Discussion A robust discussion was held on several topics identified in this review. The need to balance speed (if vaccine supplies are as projected, vaccination rates may be able to be maintained at a high level) versus strategy (which s trategies are relatively straight forward to implement but can reduce transmission more quickly than blanket immunization?) was recognized. Ring vaccination was di scussed at length , with some disagreement relating to its feasibility. In one perspective, the incubation time and pre- symptomatic phase of smallpox has clear similarities to COVID -19 and ring vaccination was effective for controlling smallpox outbreaks . In the other perspective, ring vaccination requires extensive contact tracing infrastructure ( ideally two generations of contacts identified both forwards and backwards) , and the availability of outreach personnel or vaccination centres to accommodate individuals who would be quarantining as high risk contacts. Alberta Precision Laboratories has stated that they will decrease broad screening for VOCs soon, which will limit extensive contact tracing on all but high- risk outbr eaks and hospitalized/emergency department patients. Although ring vaccination was seen as a potentially useful consideration after t he current caseload is reduced, the majority of members agreed that it currently does not have enough COVID -19 data to be a full recommendation and given current conditions is not likely currently feasible. One member did not agree with this , suggesting that a laboratory testing strategy was not an absolute pre -requisite , and that we should make a recommendation for ring vaccination. There was some discussion on how additional provincial data might support the evolution of the vaccination strategy in Alberta. Information regarding previous infection rates, age structure of each local geographic area (LGA), vaccine intention, and degree of immunization across eligible groups can help identify where variations in vaccine uptake might be attributed to population structure or access barriers rather than hesitancy. The committee also discussed how changes in supply would affect the vaccination strategy. As we are expected to receive large shipments of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen in the coming weeks, there was concern from som e committee members 11 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 that targeti ng doses to specific populations or LGAs and maintaining eligibility c riteria may slow down the vaccine rollout. Instead, the committee suggested that focusing attention on those with high- exposure risk and improving access to vaccines would balance need w ith efficiency to get the highest vaccine coverage in the shortest amount of time. Recommendations 1. \"Hotspot\" Vaccination with Phase 3: As new vaccine supply becomes available, weighting the supply to areas of high incidence and active case rates as accessi ble to all eligible individuals in those areas could lower provincial hospitalization rates ICU utilization, and deaths . Rationale: The modelling evidence suggests that after a certain proportion of medically vulnerable people have been vaccinated, an exposure risk targeted strategy by geography (\"hotspot\" strategy) can reduce hospitalizations and ICU admissions in situations of limited supply, and offer practical advantages over essential work er or network -exposure targeted strategies, with potentially greater equity. However, with supply expected to significantly increase over the coming weeks , there is a need to balance the risk that an operationally complex targeted exposure- risk strategy could inadvertently slow the overall vaccination rates by limiting eligibility . 2. Vaccine uptake in hotspot areas should be optimized by outreach and continued engagement with local community leaders and health care workers, to address local barriers to vaccination as appropriate. A variety of strategies could be c onsidered , including neighbourhood and community pop -up clinics, mobile clinics, and/or workplace- based clinics in high risk workplaces as is feasible. Rationale: In general, the modelling studies required 60- 80% vaccine uptake to achieve herd immunity. Tools and resources to address vaccine hesitancy and mitigate the barriers to vaccination such as financial or employment barriers, travel requirements, or mistrust of healthcare institutions will be critical to reaching the necessary level of population coverage to achieve low endemic rather than pandemic COVID -19 in Alberta. The effectiveness of different types of strategies to increase vaccine uptake should be tracked to guide rollout. Practical Considerations Ring Vaccination: evidence for this strategy in COVID- 19 is not c urrently at a level to support a recommendation. As public health contact tracing capacity and vaccine supply permits, ring vaccination of contacts can be evaluated for feasibility in low transmission areas, particularly in non- B.1.1.7. VOC cases where public health support is enhanced. Rationale: Ring vaccination was effectively used to help eradicate Smallpox and control the recent Ebola outbreaks in West Africa. Although the capacity for forwards and backwards contact tracing is not available for the current COVID -19 active caseload, t he concept of \"taking the vaccine to the people that need it\" could be a useful way to quickly control outbreaks in low incidence settings as they arise through 2021 and into the future. A communication strategy to promote vaccination among individuals who have been identified as a contact of a COVID -19 case (or 12 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 contacts of contacts) has the potential to function in a similar way to ring vaccination in the absence of capacity to formally trace and vaccinate several generations of contacts, but would require the ability for contacts to be quickly and safely vaccinated (currently contacts are quarantined and attendance at va ccine clinics is not encouraged) . An epidemiologist from LSTMH who modelled ring vaccination for Ebola, Adam Kucharksi , was contacted t o see if they had modeled ring vaccination for COVID -19. He noted they had considered it bu t not done it with the following comments: \"As noted in our EID paper on Ebola, ring vaccination works best when you have a system that can contact trace effectively (because vaccination essentially supplements the role of quarantine in getting ahead of the outbreak). For infections with a short interval (e.g. 5- 6 days for SARS -CoV-2 vs about 2 weeks for Ebola) and presymptomatic transmission, contact tracing - and hence any ring vaccination that piggy backs on the same protocol - will often struggle. In recent Ebola (and earlier smallpox) outbreaks, the net of 'contacts -of-contacts' to be vaccinated in the ring has sometimes been cast quite wide (e.g. a whole communit y) to reduce the risk of a missed contact undermining control. Vietnam's contacts -of-contacts -of-contacts tracing for COVID is probably in practice quite similar to this sort of concept - effectively targeting communities rather than individual contact links. If there is substantial variation in where infections are happening (e.g. very local clustering) there could be an argument to targeting 'rings' around these areas as a priority if logistics are feasible. Although if transmission is widespread, and tra cking infection difficult, that may leave at -risk groups in non- ring areas v ulnerable\" (personal communication). This comment would support that geographic hotspot strategies if focused could be functionally similar to ring vaccination if do ne at the level of postal code as case numbers decrease. A hybrid model of vaccine allocation may offer greatest transmission control for the entire population, after highly medically vulnerable populations (such as the elderly) have attained good vaccine coverage, with a switch to an exposure- risk prioritization strategy for eligible individuals in areas with high transmission. There may be substantial overlap between essential worker populations and current hotspot communities. Current hotspots in Alberta correspon d to areas where the primary industry requires a high number of social contacts (such as the hospitality industry in Banff, or oil & gas work camps in Northern Alberta). \"Hotspots\" can be assessed by incidence and active case rate /100,000) . The definition of what would be considered a hotspot could be based on the highest transmission areas with the threshold guided by the amount of available vaccine for allocated for exposure risk campaigns. It is noted for example that currently 75% of Albertans reside in areas with >300/100,000 case rates so that level would not offer discrimination (see Table 1). The proportion of curren tly vaccine ineligible adults age 19-40 is 70% in the highest case rate areas . 13 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 Table 1. Total population in potential \"hotspot\" areas by threshold Active case rate /100 000 Total population in affected areas Population age d 19-40 in affected areas May 5, 2021 from the AHS immunization dashboard . As the \"third wave\" subsides in Alberta, an opportunity to surveil for communi ty incidence increases could be identified by a more comprehensive wastewater monitoring program , which can provide a forecast of expected cases in the coming weeks, potentially before cases come to medical attention. The feasibility of this would require assessment. Non-pharmaceutical interventions that reduce physical contacts (ie. business restrictions, gathering restrictions, and social distancing requirements) remain critical to control disease transmission during vaccine roll -out. Vaccines that require a single dose (such as that developed by Janssen) and may be in lower supply sh ould be allocated to individuals who may be at risk for missing second doses (such as transient or hard- to-track populations) . Research Gaps There are no comparative or retrospective observational studies to support the findings of the modelling studies. There is a relative lack of qualitative evidence to address the ethical perspectives, equity concerns, and perspectives of populations who might be affected by a vaccine distribution plan based on transmission/exposure risk . Existing models have varied assumptions that may need to be adjusted based on vaccine rollout experience in various juri sdictions. Additional research evaluating the impact of ring vaccination would hel p clarify the optimal way to integrate this strategy with geographic hotspot vaccination or other approaches. Strength of Evidence Although the body of evidence for this review is reasonably substantial for such a rapidly evolving topic, it is weak overall. The majority of included articles are modelling studies and preprints, and given the nature of the pandemic and vaccine availability only since the start of 2021, there is limite d real -world (retrospective) evidence to support the findings of the extensive modelling studies that were identified. These models may be built with real data, but the outputs are extremely specific to the assumed model parameters. Therefore, the concepts and general findings from the models are likely applicable to the research questions but the magnitude of the effect may be different when the Alberta context is considered. The grey literature comes from reputable sources and can be used to confirm that other jurisdictions are considering or using transmission risk as criteria for prioritizing vaccination . No evidence was identified from Alberta; however, there were five articles 14 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 that were from Canadian research groups and produced a model or study result s based on Canadian data and preferences. It is notable that the evidence included in this review is remarkably consistent, lending support to the concept of transmission/exposure risk. Limitations of this review This review is subject to several limitations that may affect the findings. First and foremost, the body of evidence is heavily based on modelling studies rather than retrospective experience. Further, most of the included studies have not yet been peer reviewed. This is intended to be a r apid review, so the database search was thorough but not systematic and only articles in English were included. It is possible that relevant studies have not been included. Finally, the short turnaround for this review and rapid evolution of vaccine strategy evidence makes it difficult to conduct an in- depth assessment of each study for quality and relevance. Summary of Evidence There was very limited peer -reviewed evidence of implementation of exposure- based or transmission -based vaccination allocation st rategies. Of 160 relevant articles identified from database searching and ad hoc additions, 36 pieces of primary literature and five pieces of grey literature were included in the final synthesis. 30 of these were modelling studies (20 preprints), and six studies using other methodologies (two preprint). The breakdown of the included literature is shown in Table 2 below. The evidence extracted from the peer -reviewed and preprint article s is included in Table 4 in the appendix. Table 2.

Note: In this section, the strategies in the literature will be discusse d in broad terms. T he details and findings of the modelling studies testing different strategies is addressed in the next section under question 2. Evidence from secondary and grey literature The COVID -END evidence network maintains a living profile of evidence related to the COVID -19 vaccine rollout. In the most recent update (April 6, 2021), the authors identified three pieces of grey literature demonstrating that transmission/exposure - based vaccine allocation is under consideration or underway in other jurisdictions (COVID -END, 2021). This is a relatively new development - these allocation plans were not available in the previous iterations (COVID -END, 2021). Jurisdictions that have expanded vaccine priorities to those at high risk of disease transmission include: Ontario (geographic hotspots), New Zealand (border workers , essential workers ), China (essential services), Australia ( essential workers ), Hong Kong (essential workers), Ireland (living and working in crowded conditions) and Germany (education workers) (COVID -END, 2021) . A technical report from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) reports that six European countries (Austria, Germany, Malta, Norway, Poland, Spain) have adapted their vaccine prioritization schemes in response to the rise of CO VID-19 variants of concern (ECDC, 2021). These adaptations include included providing more vaccine doses to areas of high incidence or a redefinition of the priority groups based on the epidemiological situation (ECDC, 2021). Detailed example 1: Ireland The Irish Health Information and Quality Authority recently conducted a rapid review and analysis of the risk of infection and severe outcomes for people aged 18- 64 who are at high risk of COVID -19 exposure and transmission due to occupation or housing status. In this study, 12 at -risk groups were identified: Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group) , Roma community (a nomadic ethnic group) , residents and staff of refugee assistance centres , prisoners and prison staff, people who are experiencing homeless ness and staff in homeless -serving facilities, addiction service users and staff in these services, people working in food processing plants, residents and staff of women's refuges, undocumented migrants, sex workers, and seasonal harvest workers (Health Informatio n and Quality Authority, 2021). In this study, Travellers, refugees, and meatpacking plant workers were all at significantly increased crude risk of infection compared to general population, but not necessarily at risk of severe outcomes ( Health Informati on and Quality Authority, 2021) . 16 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 This review identified v accine allocation frameworks from John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that include priority for people whose living or working conditions give them an elevated risk of infection, even if they have a lesser or unknown risk of severe illness and death (Health Information and Quality Authority, 2021) . No recommendations are made in this review, but the conclusions suggest that vacci ne distribution to these groups should be considered in the context of existing prioritization schemes, risk of transmission, where eligibility might intersect , and the logistical challenges of prioritizing these groups (Health Information and Quality Auth ority, 2021) . Detailed example 2: Ontario Ontario has recently announced a change to their \"Phase 2\" vaccine rollout to prioritize communities with a high incidence of COVID -19 (Ontario Ministry of Health, 2021). Residents of neighborhoods with the lowest risk of SARS -CoV-2 infections were 1.5 times more likely to have received at least one COVID -19 vaccine dose by April 5, 2021, as compared to residents of neighborhoods with the highest risk of SARS -CoV-2 infections. However, the average incidence of SARS -CoV-2 infections between March 7 and April 3, 2021 was 9 times lower in neighborhoods with the lowest risk of SARS - CoV-2 infections (Mishra et al., 2021). N eighborhoods with low vaccination rates relative to incidence tend to be younger , may have higher concentrations of Black or racialized populations , lower income, and materially deprived populations (Mishra et al., 2021; Ontario Ministry of Health, 2021). Other risk factors include multigenerational households, high- density housing, precarious employment and lack of paid sick leav e (Mishra et al., 2021). In the new scheme, vaccines are allocated to adults aged 50+ in COVID -19 Hot Spot Communities, starting with older individuals and decreasing in age, followed by essential workers who cannot work from hom e (Ontario Ministry of Health, 2021). These changes were made based on modelling from the Ontario Science Advisory Table, showing substantial overlap between neighborhoods with high incident COVID -19 rates and proportion of essential workers. In this model , the potential effect of a hotspot vaccination strategy to complement the existing medical risk -based strategy is demonstrated . In the model, 50% of the vaccine shipments to Ontario were allocated to 74 hotspot communities and distributed to all individuals over age 16; the remaining 50% of the shipment was distributed according to the existing paradigm based on age and medical risk (Mishra et al., 2021). The authors assumed a vaccine efficacy of 60% for preventing infection ; that 80% of adults ov er 60 were vaccinated prior to redirecting vaccines to hotspots; and that they would achieve 70% coverage in those aged 16- 59 in hotspot communities. Modelling vaccine distribution to COVID -19 hotspots showed that an additional 14% of hospitalizations and ICU admissions and 11% of deaths could be prevented compared to the current vaccination strategy of continuing with age/medical risk prioritization (Mishra et al., 2021). Evidence from the primary literature There was limited documentation of vaccine allocation to populations at high risk of COVID -19 exposure/transmission. Israel and US approaches: 17 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 The Israeli vaccine advisory committee considered scenarios to prioritize those with medical risk versus prioritizing those with transmission ris k and ultimately chose allocation based on medical risk (Rosen, Waitzberg & Israeli, 2021). Notably, in 2021 Israel was able to add younger adults and some essential workers (such as teachers) to their immunization campaigns to increase the population coverage and reduce disease transmission (Rosen, Waitzberg & Israeli, 2021). In the United States, there is a high degree of variability between states regarding how essential workers are prioritized. All states have prioritized frontline healthcare workers accord ing to federal guidance; although this guidance has classified first re sponders into a single high- priority group, they are often prioritiz ed lower (Jain et al., 2021). The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee recommend that non- healthcare essential workers are vaccinated after those in long - term care, but before those with medical risk (Dooling et al., 2021). In general, vaccine allocation across the United States is based on medical risk rather than transmissio n/exposure risk and contradicts the recommendations of the CDC (Jain et al., 2021). Of note, these studies report on the content of existing policies rather than the impact - this is a key shortcoming of these articles. Public health expert and stakeholder options: A Canadian survey of 156 public health experts and stakeholders revealed that across five pandemic scenarios, protecting the medically vulnerable was generally the highest priority for vaccine allocation, followed in descending order by protecti ng healthcare capacity , minimizing transmission , and protecting critical infrastructure (Zhao, Ismail & Tunis, preprint). This priority list mirrors Canadian public opinion on vaccine allocation (Zhao, Ismail & Tunis, preprint). Modelling studies: Modelling studies used six different ways to identify and prioritize populations with high transmission/exposure risk . Each modelling study proposed a slightly different prioritization scheme, rollout plan, and comparator, but they can broadly be grouped i nto the categories listed in Table 3 below. No secondary literature was identified to synthesize the evidence available from modelling studies. Table 3.

(preprint) uses data from British Columbia (BC) to show how existing vaccine supply can be used for populations with medical risk in addition to essential workers (\"front -line workers\"). This model is predicated on the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine and the delay in rollout due to concerns of VIPIT (Adibi et al., preprint). In this model, all 246700 doses of the AZ vaccine are allocated to front -line workers (unspecified) despite VIPIT risk, while mRNA vaccines (such as Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) are offered to individual s over 60 years old (scenario A) , versus delaying front -line vaccination until after those with medical risk are offered the mRNA vaccines (scenario B) (Adibi et al., preprint) . Compared to scenario B, scenario A resulted in 27175 fewer COVID -19 cases, 506 fewer hospitalizations, 87 fewer deaths, and 1462 fewer cases of Long COVID (Adibi et al., preprint). In this scenario, the expected number of deaths due to VIPIT after second doses are administered is less than 1 (0.676 [95% CI 0.413- 0.995] ) with a 49% p robability of observing at least one death due to VIPIT by the end of the summer (Adibi et al., preprint). MacIntyre , Costantino & Trent (preprint) model a ring vaccination strategy , with the assumption that existing COVID -19 vaccines will have at least 45% efficacy when administered as post-exposure prophylaxis (not based on data). In this strategy, all contacts of a confirmed case are vaccinat ed and the contacts of the contacts are vaccinated in turn ( MacIntyre, Costantino & Trent , preprint). This strategy is the most efficient way to deliver vaccine doses compared to age- based vaccination when supply is limited, although it would require robust public health infrastructure to ensur e that at least 90% of contacts are identified, traced, and vaccinated (MacIntyre, Costantino & Trent , preprint). Synthesis of the Information Relating to Question 1 Taken together, the grey literature and primary literature presented here show that ther e are several ways to identify and prioritize populations at high risk of COVID -19 transmission/exposure. Modelling studies show that transmission/exposure risk can be 19 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 considered in several different way s, not just by geography or by occupation. Age, housi ng situation , and number of social contacts can all be used to prioritize vaccination to influence disease transmission. The modelling stud ies by Adibi et al. (preprint) and MacIntyre, Costantino & Trent (preprint) show that simultaneous complementary vaccination strategies are possible, and may have a substantial effect on health resources. It appears that vaccination strategies to minimize transmission are growing in popularity - Ontario, New Zealand, China, Australia, Hong Kong, Austria, Malta, Norway, Poland, Spain, and Germany have all prioritized vaccinations for populations at high risk of transmission, or have adapted their existing plans to include these groups. Many of these jurisdictions are good comparators for Alberta and show that transmiss ion-based vaccination strategies are possible. In the face of scarce vaccination supply, is there evidence to support the use of exposure -risk vaccination strategies alongside medical -risk strategies to reduce community COVID -19 transmi ssion? Evidence fr om the primary literature Only model ling evidence is available to demonstrate the potential effects of a vaccination strategy based on exposure/transmission risk. An optimal vaccine allocation plan is not static ; rather, it depends on the priorities of those implementing the vaccination campaign. The strategy for minimizing overall deaths may be different from the strategy to minimize total years of life lost, minimizing disease transmission, minimizing hospitalizat ions & ICU admissions, or maximizing value for money. In addition, the specific outputs from each model depend on the data used to build it and the assumptions made regarding vaccine efficacy, assumed population coverage; rate of vaccination, reproduction number, non- pharmaceutical interventions (eg. public health recommendations & restrictions), timing, and vaccine uptake. The general findings of the modelling studies are presented here for the sake of brevity. The models almost universally showed that whe n vaccine supply is scarce (resulting in low population coverage), vaccinating working- age people with a high number of social interactions (whether due to geographic location, occupation, education, or other cause) is an effective way to mitigate COVID -19 incidence (Bubar et al., preprint; et al., preprint; al., Wang, Wu & Tang, preprint; Yu et al., preprint). When the goal is to reduce mortality and healthcare utilizati on (hospitalizations and ICU admissions), vaccinating older people (aged 60+) and other populations with medical risk is still the best option (Bubar et al., 2021; Buckner, Chowell & Springborn; preprint; Chapman et al., et al., 2021; Foy et al., 2021; Goldenbogen et al., preprint; Herings et al., preprint; Hogan Last revised: Wu & Tang, preprint; Yu et al., preprint). Of note, these models assumed that the vaccination campaigns were starting from scratch (ie. nobody was vaccinated) and that severe outcomes would arise from people with high medical risk waiting for their vaccine. This contrasts with the results from the Ontario Science Table, who assumed that 80% of the medical risk population was already vaccinat ed at the start of the model and the allocation was changing to prioritize hotspots (Mishra et al., 2021). Occupation- based vaccination strategies in cases of scarce supply have been modeled in several studies. Babus et al. (preprint) suggests that in a s cenario where the vaccine is 50% effective at preventing infection and a targeted stay -at-home order is in place and some individuals can work from home, optimal vaccin e allocation is to vaccinate all individuals who must be present in the workplace regardless of a ge. Targeting essential work ers has the potential to minimize deaths (when starting with older essential workers), minimize YLL (when starting with younger essential workers) and minimize infections (when starting with essential workers in general ) each by 17-18% (Buckner, Chowell & Springborn, preprint). Chapman (preprint) showed using California data that targeting essential workers could avert over 101,000 COVID -19 cases and 4600 deaths. Modelling using the existing prioritization in the UK (where healthcare workers are prioritized along with those over 80 years) showed that health and social care workers accounted for 625 additional deaths, 5380 hospital izations and 662 ICU admissions compared to age- based vaccination only (Cook et al., 202 1). Similarly , vaccinating by transmission/exposure risk is not ideal for reducing severe complications . Herings (preprint) shows that 67.5% of the working age population must be vaccinated to achieve a 50% reduction in the risk of severe outcomes . Vaccin ating essential workers ahead of those with medical risk is cost effective - result ing in cost savings in populations over 65 years but overall associated with a cost of QALY of $20,000 for essential workers (well below the standard government willingness to pay of $50000 per QALY) (Kohli et al., 2021) . Canadian modelling shows that vaccinating essential workers earlier can reduce infections , hospitalizations, deaths, and instances of Lo ng COVID across a range of scenarios and data inputs (Mulberry et al., preprint) . Targeting geographic hotspots has been sho wn to reduce disease transmission and improve vaccination equity among communities that might be racialized or have a higher proport ion of those with lower socioeconomic status. Modeling from the Philippines suggested that as vaccine supply increases after the initial distribution by population , extra doses should be a llocated to Manila (where cases rates were highest) as allocating based on the number of infections generated the lowest death projections , while allocating vaccines based on population size resulted in the highest number of death projections (Buhat et al., preprint). A more theoretical modelling study showed that at a high reproductive number ( R 0) (2.5-3) and vaccination rate of 1%/day, allocating vaccines based on infection rate can reduce the epidemic peak and limit deaths compared to demographic distribution (Grauer, Lowen & Liebchen, 2020). Models based on Chinese data found that adopting a dynamic prioritization scheme to maintain R 0 around 1.5 highlighted that vaccinating younger individuals (age 15- 39) 21 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 could reduce infections by 88- 89%, while an age- based strategy was more useful for minimizing deaths and ICU admis sions (Yu et al., preprint). An ethical analysis of vaccine allocation suggested that to maximize expected benefits, scarce health resources should not necessarily be allocated purely based on individual need (ie. allocated to those with the most medical risk) (Giubilini, Savulescu & Wilkinson, 2020). In the case of COVID -19 vaccines, the authors extrapolate from influenza evidence and argue that maximum benefit can be achieved by prioritizing children and young people because they tend to get infected mor e frequently, to remain infected for longer, and therefore may transmit the disease to the elderly (Giubilini, Savulescu & Wilkinson, 2020). In this scenario, those with a high degree of medical risk are protected by the indirect immunity that comes from vaccinating young people with a high number of social interactions, rather than the direct immunity of the vaccine (Giubilini, Savulescu & Wilkinson, 2020). The authors argue that when vaccine supply is limited, the societal benefits of protecting the vulnerable and limiting social distancing restrictions outweigh the potential ethical problems of mandating children and young people to be vaccinated (even though this may not be viewed as a hardship) (Giubilini, Savulescu & Wilkinson, 2020). The concept of justice is noted by some of the authors of the models. In Hunziker (preprint) the scenario where 'younger people receive a quarter dose vaccination, leaving the elderly aside until 80% of the younger are vaccinated, then vaccinating the elderly at full dos e' had the lowest deaths in 100 d ays, the fastest time to <100k cases/day , and the fastest time to <1000 deaths . However, the authors state that this may be perceived as an unjust prioritization model as many believe that the elderly should be first in line for vaccination due to their risk (Hunziker et al. preprint). Ives & Bozzuto (preprint) propose a geographic hotspot allocation strategy where vaccines are distributed to US counties based on transmission rate (reproductive number) instead of population size. In this model, herd immunity reached earlier and with fewer vaccines and has the advantage of increasing vaccine equity for Black populations, who currently lag behind counties that are primarily Caucasian counties by about four days (Ives & Bozzuto, preprint). Synthesis of the Information Relating to Question 2 Taken together, the evidence suggests that optimal vaccine allocation in the face of scarce resources should be based on the overarching goals of the vaccination program . The strategies to minimize disease transmission are different from the strategies required to minimize mortality. Vaccination strategies to minimize mortality are most effective when the elderly and those with medical risk of severe COVID -19 are vaccinated first, while strateg ies to mitigate disease transmission are most effective when individuals at high risk of disease exposure or transmission are given priority. The modelling studies commonly assumed that vaccination campaigns were starting from scratch (ie. only natural im munity in the population), with a reproduction number 2. This limits the applicability to Alberta where nearly 80% of high risk patients are already vaccinated. The most relevant models for Alberta are likely the Ontario Science Table model (Mishra et al , 2021) and the model by Mulberry (preprint). These models use low R 0 values (less than 1.5), use Canadian population data, and the Ontario 22 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 Science Table assumes that 80% of those with age- based risk (ie. over 60 years old) is already vaccinated when alloc ation changes to prioritize hotspots. As such, when highly vulnerable populations have had good vaccine coverage, switching to a transmission reduction strategy may reduce overall case rates and also reduce morbidity and mortality . In addition, the social justice and equity concerns of vaccine allocation may be somewhat allayed by prioritizing essential workers and geographic hotspots. These populations/communities may be younger, racialized, with lower income, and have more disadvantageous social determinants of health t han the populations who are prioritized by age-based / medical -risk based strategies. Evolving Evidence Research on SARS -CoV-2 is continually evolving and as such the evidence will continue to be assessed as new information is provided. As more jurisdictions roll out their vaccine programs, more data will be available to determine the effect of the vaccination prioritization strategies. In addition, most of the evidence gathered for this review were preprints - as these studies undergo peer review, the findings and quality of the studies may change. 23 Last revised: May 4 , 2021 Appendix BC: British Columba CDC: United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention COVID -19: Coronavirus Disease 201 9 COVID -END: COVID -19 Evidence Network to support Decision- making DALY: Disability -adjusted life years ECDC: European Centre for Disease Control HCW: Healthcare worker HIC: High income country ICU: Intensive Care Unit LIC: Low income country LMIC: Lower -middle income countries LTC: Long -term care MIC: middle income NPI: intervention Advisory Group UK: Unit ed Kingdom UMIC: Upper -middle income countries US: United States VIPIT: Vaccine -Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia of Life Lost 24 Last revised: [insert date] Evidence Extraction Table Table 4.

It is hypothesized that this is also the case for COVID -19 - Indirect immunity might well confer more protection to the elderly and the other vulnerable population groups than direct vaccination - The greatest benefit of vaccinati ng children en masse will accrue to the vulnerable ones through indirect protection, rather than to the vaccinated children themselves. - Children and young people, and society more broadly, are paying a high cost for the sake of protecting the vulnerable.

However, for the high vaccination level s at which other strategies display population level immunity, those other strategies surpass vaccination by age - To reduce ICU occupancy: vaccination by age performs best at less than 58% but vaccination by interactivity is best above this level. However, below 63% vaccination, none of these strategies is able to prevent overload of ICU capacity, without additional non- pharmaceutical interventions. - The \"combined\" strategy integrates the two strategies that either best reduce infections (i.e. by i nteraction) or death toll (by age), however it outperforms neither -

In the first we sequentially allocate from the oldest age group downwards (i.e. 80+, 75+, 70+ etc.). In the second we target the working- age population first starting with the highest risk group (i.e. 60- 64) and working downwards by age, and then sequentially add in the younger and older age groups either side of the working age population until the whole population is covered - In high-income countries (HIC), upper -middle -income countries (UMIC), and lower -middle -income optimal allocation strategy is of \"herd impact' when there are sufficient doses for 20- 40% of the population. Vaccine is allocated to younger populations (including children and adults) so that transmission is reduced in the wider community and this indirectly reduces the risk to the vulnerable elderly population to a greater extent than is afforded by direct protection - in the UMIC and LMIC settings we obtain a \"mixed\" approach at these intermediate dose availability levels, with both the highest risk elderly and younger populations included. This is due to greater mixing between the older and general populations in these settings, as well as the size of the high- risk older populations, which are generally smaller than in HIC and middle -income countries (MIC) - Does not model health system capacity or disease incidence Ives & Bozzuto, preprint United States Modelling Geographic hotspots - Vaccine allocation to US counties based on transmission rate (R0) instead of population size - Counties with higher R0 values require higher levels of vaccination to achieve herd immunity (1 1/R0). - Assumptions: (i) the vaccination rate (the first dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, or the single- shot Johnson & Johnson vacci ne) is 1.58 million doses per day, starting from March 15, 2021 (day 0 on the x -axis in Fig. 1) when 71.1 million people had already been vaccinated with at least a single dose (ii) vaccines are 90% effective (iii) vaccinated individuals cannot spread COVI D- 19 - At the current rate of vaccine distribution, universal herd immunity in the US could be reached in roughly 130 days with the current population size- based distribution strategy - distributing vaccines according to R0 would mean that herd immunity is reached in all counties at the same time, about 51 days earlier than the last county under the current distribution. - 39% fewer vaccine doses would be required to achieve universal herd immunity if vaccines were distributed according to R0. - High-density counties have relatively large African American populations and the current distribution plan leads to a lag of about 4 days behind whites in reaching herd immunity Jain et al., 2021 United States Jurisdictional scan \"Essential workers\" - all U.S. States prioritized frontline healthcare workers and those in long -term care facilities for vaccination as per Federal guidance - First responders were one single group in Federal guidance, including health (e.g., paramedic) and non- health (e.g., police/fire) workers.

After all individuals in this group are vaccinated, the vaccine is administered uniformly to individuals of other ages (ii): Youngest -first strategy : the vaccine is administered to individuals younger than 20 years of age first. (iii): Uniform strategy: the vaccine is administered to all age groups uniformly from the very start (iv): Contact -based s trategy : vaccine allocated according to the relative role played by different age groups in transmission. This strategy tends to prioritiz e ages 15 -19 year first, 20- 59 year second, and gives least priority to older or younger ages - vaccinating people aged 60 years or older first prevents the most deaths out of all four strategies if vaccination begins on Jan 1, 2021 - the uniform or contact -based strategies prevent the most deaths if vaccination begins on Sept 1, 2021, and the vaccination rate ranges f rom 1% to 2\u00b75% of the population per week. - Regime 1: Vaccination starts on Jan 1, 2021, and the vaccination rate is relatively high (1\u00b70% of the population per week). A third wave in the autumn of 2021 or winter of 2022 is thereby prevented. In this reg ime, enough people are vaccinated sufficiently far in advance to prevent a third wave, but the oldest -first strategy prevents more deaths than the other strategies - Regime 2 : either vaccination starts early (Jan 1, 2021) but the vaccination rate is low ( 0\u00b75% of the population per week), or vaccination starts late (Sept 1, 2021) but the vaccination rate is high (1\u00b75% of the population per week . A sufficient proportion of the population is vaccinated for indirect protection from the vaccine to become important during the third wave, but not enough individuals are vaccinated to completely prevent it. As a result, the uniform and contact -based strategies are more effective than the oldest -first strategy, but the youngest - first strategy does worst of all Regime 3: vaccination starts late (Sept 1, 2021) and the vaccination rate is relatively low (1\u00b70% of the population per week). This scenario does not allow enough time for indirect protection from vaccination to become strong. As a result, the oldest -first strategy prevents more deaths than the other three strategies .

Ring vaccination with at least 90% of contacts traced can rapidly reduce disease incidence, cumulative cases, and deaths. - With unlimited vaccine supply , mass vaccination with a high efficacy vaccine and rapid uptake (at least 75,000 people vaccinated per day) will be the only strategy able to achieve herd immunity and prevent community transmission 35 Last revised: [insert date] Reference Study Type Targeted Population Vaccination Strategy / Modelling Assumptions Effects of Vaccination Strategy / Optimal Vaccination Strategy Notes Matrajt et al., preprint United States (Washington State) Modelling Younger age (high transmission) -

Rosen, Waitzberg & Israeli, 2021 Israel Policy analysis n/a - The initial target groups for vaccination in Israel were people aged 60 and over, nursing home residents, other people at very high risk due to serious specific medical conditions (mostly those related to compromised respiratory systems), and front -line health care workers - Before deciding to prioritize the groups at the greatest health risk, the relevant committee considered an alternative strategy - prioritizing those groups most involved in transmitting the disease. After deliberating the two strategies prioritization of those at greatest health risk emerged as the consensus. - Since the start of 2021, it has been possible to extend immunization to additional groups, such as teachers and persons under age 60, and significantly increase the percentage of the population covered Saraswat, Ansumali & Prakash, preprint India Modelling Risk of transmission in a multi - generational home - Vaccine effectiveness of 67% in reducing infections, 70% in reducing the transmission - \"Adult\" = 20- 60 years old; \"Senior\" = 60+ years old - The focus of this work is on how vaccination of the \"Adults\" (ages 20 to 60) reduces the secondary infections and deaths among the \"Seniors\" (ages 60 and above). - two different strategies : - By adopting a targeted strategy, the susceptible Adults from multigenerational families may all be vaccinated in a relatively short time of 52 days if administered at 2 million doses per day, compared to a uniform age- based strateg y - In most realistic scenarios, the number of deaths among the Seniors due to transmissions from the adults in the family are likely to be reduced by over 100,000 due to the targeted strateg y - Authors do not state assumed R0 value or population coverage 39 Last revised: [insert date] Reference Study Type Targeted Population Vaccination Strategy / Modelling Assumptions Effects of Vaccination Strategy / Optimal Vaccination Strategy Notes (i) age-based roll -down to younger populations (ii) preferential targeted vaccination of younger members from multigenerational homes. Shayak et al., preprint United States (New York State) Modelling High interaction rate based on occupation - Assumes all healthcare workers are prioritized first - R0 = 1.3 - Vaccinat ion rate of 600/day - Vaccine effectiveness = 80% - Model population = 3 million people - Reference case: 10 percent of the population has an interaction rate significantly higher than the remaining 90 per cent - Vaccination strategy: (i) Population- based: the vaccines are allotted to the high- and low -interaction classes in proportion to their population. (ii) Interaction- based: vaccines are allotted to the high-interaction class first No vaccines : - Epidemic endpoint at 241 days. - The terminal number of cases is 1,27,600 - Epidemic peak at ~70 days Population -based strategy: - Entire pop ulation vaccinated in 500 days - Epidemic peak at ~70 days - Outbreak endpoint at 214 days, - Total case count is 71,000 cases have broken out - nearly 1,25,000 vaccines have been distributed Interaction -based strategy: - Epidemic endpoint is 203 days. - Epidemic peak however comes 20 days earlier than with the population vaccination (~50 days) - total case count has reduced to less than 16,000. - The number of vaccines distributed up to the end is just less than 1,18,000 Shim, 2021 South Korea Modelling Age (younger people have higher transmission rates) - R0= 2.6 - 16 age groups (0- 4, 5-9, 10- 14, ..., 65 -69, 70-74, and 75 years) - Vaccine assumed to provide partial protection - Vaccine efficacy = 70% (unless otherwise stated) When vaccine coverage is 50% (with two doses per vaccine recipient) and vaccine efficacy is 70% - the incidence- minimizing strategy prioritized the vaccination of individuals aged 20- 49 years to reduce the incidence by 61% - To minimize mortality, the vaccines should be allocated to older adults aged 50 years and above, which would reduce total COVID -19 mortality by 70% across age groups - To minimize Years of Life Lost, vaccines should be allocated to adults aged 40 -69 years because of the higher number of expected life- years remaining in this age group When vaccine coverage is <50% with 70% efficacy: - the incidence- minimizing strategy switched to prioritizing those aged 10 -19 years and 30- 49 years due to active transmission between school -aged children and their parents 40 Last revised: [insert date] Reference Study Type Targeted Population Vaccination Strategy / Modelling Assumptions Effects of Vaccination Strategy / Optimal Vaccination Strategy Notes - the YLL -minimizing strategy narrowed its prioritization to adults aged 50- 69 years due to a combination of the expected life years remaining and the greater infection severity in this age group - The mortality -minimizing strategy was optimized by vaccinating the elderly (age 70 years) and using the remaining doses for adults aged 60 -69 years. When vaccine efficacy is low (undefined): - reducing vaccine efficacy against infection elevated the prioritization of vaccinating teenagers when the vaccine supply was increasingly limited - the YLL- minimizing strategy switching from vaccinating individuals aged 30- 59 years to vaccinating those in the 50-year age group. When vaccine supply is very limited, individuals in the age group of 10- 19 years and 50- 59 years should be vaccinated in the optimal allocation strategy to minimize YLL When R0 = 1.5 and vaccine efficacy = 90% - the optimal vaccine allocation is generally focused on younger adults aged 30- 49 years across all three aims - When vaccine supply is high, all three optimal strategies lead to a broader vaccination strategy of those aged 10-69 years, with a small fraction of vaccines prioritized for those aged 0- 9 and 70 years. - When vaccine supply is <50%, the incidence- minimizing strategy prioritized the vaccination of individuals aged 30-59 years, while the mortality -minimizing strategy and the YLL- minimizing strategy prioritized individuals aged 10-19 and 50 years Sj\u00f6din, Rockl\u00f6v, & Britton, 2021 Sweden Modelling Age (younger people have higher transmission rates) - 10-year age groups (0 -10, 11 -20, 21 -30, ..., 71 - 80, 80+) ;

If both age groups have been covered completely, the remaining vaccines are distributed at random in the population to all individuals over the age of 16. Reducing deaths: - including the 70- 79 age group results in 0.67% (IQR: 0.48% 0.95%) fewer deaths, and including group results in 3.95% (IQR: 3.28% 5.08%) fewer deaths Low supply scenario (4.7% coverage) : - allocating 25% of vaccines to the 20- 49 age group and the remaining 75% to the 70+ age group is optimal in terms of minimizing deaths and hospitalizations - 75/25 allocations (younger/older) are best at reducing case counts and near -optimal at reducing hospitalizations but they are associated with a substantially higher final death count - prioritization of vaccine allocation to t he 70+ age group has a modest effect on reducing hospitalizations and a substantial effect on reducing deaths, as much as a 7% difference in cumulative deaths High supply scenario (28.3% coverage): - strategies focused on the elderly can reduce cumulative death numbers by as much as 10% when compared to a random distribution strategy - The optimal strategy among those evaluated is a 25/75 distribution to the 20- 49 and 70+ age groups, outperforming the 60+ strategy and the 20- 39 and 60+ strategy with 25/75 allocation, both of which vaccinate more elderly individuals but do not reduce transmission - Under a 10/90 allocation (younger/older) , the mortality benefits are substantial, with 11% fewer deaths when compared to a 90/10 allocation in which the 20- 49 age group is vaccinated earlier Wang, Wu, & Tang, preprint China Modelling Transmission risk based on age - 16 age groups (0-4,5-9,10-14,...,75+) based on contact data - Vaccination rates = 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.15% - Outcomes: basic reproduction number (R0), the cumulative number of infections (Ic) and the cumulative number of deaths (Dc) - The optimal age- specific vaccination distribution (OAVD) is determined by minimizing each of the India Case: - Priority of vaccination should be given to teenagers and young people, i.e., those around 10- 34 years old to minimize R0 and number of infections - In order to minimize mortality , the OAVD suggests that the high priority should be given to elders in India - the optimal age- specific vaccination strategy can reduce infections by 177,270(8.5%) or reduce deaths by 1,514 43 Last revised: [insert date] Reference Study Type Targeted Population Vaccination Strategy / Modelling Assumptions Effects of Vaccination Strategy / Optimal Vaccination Strategy Notes three endpoints from the vaccination initiating time (T) to T+180 days for each country - Models set using population age distributions from India, China and Italy - Vaccination scenarios: (i) uniform vaccination strateg y (ii) age-specific vaccination strategy (27%) compared to that of the uniform vaccination strategy - the effect of age- specific vaccination distribution on the three endpoints is larger when the vaccination rate is higher Italy case: - the vaccination priority should be given to young and middle aged people in order to control infections while the priority should be given to the elderly in order to control mortality China case: - Priority to the young and middle- aged people to control infections and R0 - Unlike Italy and India, prioritizing the young and middle- aged will also control deaths - Use of the optimal age- specific vaccination strategy could reduce infections from 6,873,110 to 2,178,877 or more than 3- fold reduction or it can reduce deaths from 28,575 to 11,953 (2.4- fold reduction) compared to that of uniform distribution in C hina Yu et al., preprint China Modelling Hotspots - \"Dynamic prioritization of vaccines based on epidemiological situation\" - Prioritization decisions are made to keep R0 at 1.5 - 2 million doses per day (0.14% rollout speed) - Vaccine efficacy = 80% for ages 15- 59 years, 60% for ages 60+, 60% for ages < 14 years - Vaccination is administered to essential workers first. Each age group is stratified into two categories: essential workers (tier 1) and other individuals (tier 2). Essential workers include healthcare workers (either front -line or not) and workers in the following sectors: law enforcement and security, nursing home and social welfare institutes, community, energy, food and transportation. - The optimal prioritization strategies perform dramatically better than the uniform strategy with respect to any risk metric (more than 87% reduction vs. less than 70% Minimizing infections: - the optimal strategy prioritizes individuals aged 15- 39 year until 46.6% coverage is reached; then, vaccines are administered to individuals aged 40- 64 years until 26.9% coverage is reached - Optimal strategy can reduce infections by 88-89% compared to uniform strategy Minimizing deaths: - individuals aged 65 years and older are identified as the first priority u ntil 58.6% coverage is reached, followed by aged 40- 64 until 18.5% coverage and then aged 65+ until an almost full coverage is achieved - Optimal strategy can reduce deaths by 87- 92% compared to uniform strategy Minimizing ICU admissions 44 Last revised: [insert date] Reference Study Type Targeted Population Vaccination Strategy / Modelling Assumptions Effects of Vaccination Strategy / Optimal Vaccination Strategy Notes - Optimal strategies are compared to a uniform (random) vaccination strategy for non- essential worker in each age group - first priority i s given to individuals aged 65+ years and nearly all of them need to be vaccinated before moving to other age groups - Optimal strategy can reduce ICU admissions by 88- 92% compared to uniform strategy Zhao, Ismail & Tunis, preprint Canada Canadian e xpert stakeholder analysis n/a - Surveyed stakeholders: Clinical and public health experts (Federal) , national health prof essional associations, provincial, territorial, and national Indigenous groups, Federal government departments, patient and community advocacy groups - 156 surveys, distributed, 47.4% response rate. 22 (29.7%) respondents were members of clinical or public health expert groups involved with PHAC, 19 (25.7%) were patient or community advocacy representatives or experts from the CanCOVID network, 16 (21.6%) were executives of Canadian health professional associations, nine (12.2%) were members of provincial and territorial committees or national Indigenous groups, and eight (10.8%) were representatives of federal government departments - Stakeholders asked to rank the importance of four strategies over f our different COVID -19 transmission scenarios : Protecting those with the highest medical risk; protecting healthcare capacity; minimizing COVID - 19 transmission; protecting critical infrastructure - Across all four scenarios, stakeholders generally consider ed protecting the vulnerable to be first priority, followed by protecting healthcare capacity and minimizing transmission.

KRS searched databases for articles published from 2020 -2021 and included: Medline, Healthstar, Pubmed, Trip Pro, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, WHO Global Research Database on COVID -19 /LitCovid, and Google Scholar. The search strategy is included below; briefly, the strategy involved two key concepts: \"COVID -19\" and \"vaccination strategies\" . Articles identified by KRS in their search were initially screened for obvious irrelevance by title against the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed in Table 9 below. 140 articles were identified by KRS with references and abstracts provided for further review. 20 additional articles were identified ad hoc . 148 articles remained f ollowing deduplication.15 articles were excluded based on information in the title and abstract, and an additional 102 articles were excluded following full-text screening. In total, 133 articles were excluded from the review in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria stated below ; 41 articles were retained for the final narrative synthesis. Table 9. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for results of the literature search Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria - COVID -19 - Article describes exposure risk vaccination strategy or model - Article describes effect on disease transmission / dynamics - Meta -analysis, systematic review, RCT, observational studies, epidemiological studies, computer modelling study - Published last 2 years - Any jurisdiction - English language - Article is not from a credible source - Article does not have a clear research question or issue - Presented data/evidence is not sufficient to address the research questions - Editorial, commentary, narrative review, abstract only - Study does not consider exposure/transmission risk - Study does not describe the effect of the vaccination strategy - Viruses other than COVID -19 Critical Evaluation of the Evidence Exclusion criteria for study quality were adapted from the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) (Hong et al., 2018). Potential articles were evaluated on three criteria: 1) Peer reviewed or from a reputable source; 2) Clear research question or issue; 3) Whether the presented data/evidence is appropriate to address the research question. Preprints and non peer -reviewed literature (such as commentaries and letters from credible journals) are not excluded out of hand due to the novelty of COVID -19 and the speed with which new evidence is available. Table 10 below is a narrative summary of the body of evidence included in this review. The categories, format, and suggested information for inclusion were adapted from the Oxford Centre for Evidence- Based Medicine, the Cochrane Library, and the AGREE Trust Gavinder & 2010). 51 Last revi sed: [insert date] Table 10. Narrative overview of the literature included in this review. Description Volume 1 systematic reviews were included , 30 modelling studies were included (20 were pre- review , five studies of other methodologies (two were pre- review). Five pieces of grey literature were identified and included. Quality In general, the body of evidence for this topic is of low quality . The majority of included articles are preprints, and there is limited real -world evidence to support the findings of the extensive modelling studies that were identified. The grey literature is from reputable sources and can be used to confirm that other jurisdictions are considering or using transmission risk as a prioritization criteria for vaccination campaigns. Applicability No evidence was identified from Alberta; however, there were five articles that were from Canadian research groups and produced a model or study results based on Canadian data and preferences. The study evidence is applicable to the review questions , although the lack of real-world evidence limits the utility of this review. Consistency The evidence is remarkably consisten t across included studies. 52 Last revi sed: [insert date] Search Strategy Ovid MEDLINE(R) and In- Process, In -Data -Review & Other Non- Indexed Citations 1946 to April 15, 2021, Ovid Healthstar 1966 to November 2020 Date Searched: April 15- 16, 2021 Search Strategy: # Searches or Coronavirus/ or Coronavirus Infections/ viru* or ncov* or n -cov* or novel cov * or COVID -19 or COVID19 or COVID- 2019 or COVID2019 or SARS -CoV-2 or SARSCoV -2 SARSCoV2 or or 2019 ncov or 2019ncov).ti,a b. 154892 3 or 2 165506 4 COVID -19 Vaccines/ or Vaccines/ or Viral Vaccines/ Immunization/ Secondary/ or Immunotherapy, Active/ 5 administer* administrat* priorit* 99196 6 (ring vaccin* or shield vaccin*).ti,ab. 205 7 5 or 6 99292 8 3 and 4 and 7 853 9 limit 8 to (english language and yr=\"2020 -Current\") 577 10 remove duplicates from 9 433 PubMed Date Searched: April 15- 16, 2021 Search Strategy: \"optimiz*\"[Title]) 6 ring vaccin*[Title/Abstract] OR shield vaccin*[Title/Abstract] 727 7 5 or 6 15473 8 3 and 4 and 7 517 9 limit 8 to (english language and yr=\"2020 -Current\") 429 Trip Pro Date Searched: immunis*) AND (strateg* or allocat* or or -out distribu* administer* administrat* priorit* or deploy* or optimal* or optimiz*)from:2020 (734) First 10 pages reviewed. medRxiv & bioRxiv Date Searched: April 15- 16, 2021 Search Strategy: title and abstract (all), Jan. 01, 2020- Apr. 16, 2021: covid -19 vaccine -19 vaccine rollout; covid- 19 vaccine program title and abstract (all), Jan. 01, 2020- Apr. 16, 2021: covid- 19 vaccination allocation; covid- 19 vaccination rollout; covid- 19 vaccination program WHO Global Research Database on COVID -19 /Lit Covid Date Searched: April15 -16, 2021 Search Strategy: (vaccine or vaccination) AND (strategy or strategies or allocate or allocation or priority or prioritization or optimal or optimization or rollout or program) First 10 pages reviewed if required.
