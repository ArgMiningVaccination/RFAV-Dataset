This includes pains, arthritis or injuries of the knees, shoulder, hips, ankles, and muscles, tendonitis, tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, and neuromas. Using a molecule made from oxygen called ozone, together with nutrients, prolozone helps to promote healing and regeneration of the area, reduce pain and inflammation, and improve function. Prolotherapy uses injections of dextrose and other substances to create local inflammation. This inflammation stimulates healing of the area, which ultimately can help improve the structures like ligaments and tendons, improve stability, and reduce pain. An important distinction to make is that whereas traditional steroid injections only act to reduce the inflammation, Prolozone and prolotherapy injections are harnessing the body's healing mechanisms to help heal the area involved. Finally, the addition of biological allograft can greatly improve upon the healing process by increasing the growth of new tissue, repairing the site of injury. "}
