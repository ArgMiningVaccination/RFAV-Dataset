The agreement provides Biosense Webster, headquartered in Diamond Bar, Calif., with exclusive, worldwide rights toa patent-pending algorithm discovered by a research teamheaded by Omer Berenfeld, PhD, research assistant professorof pharmacology at the Institute for CardiovascularResearch at SUNY Upstate.\"This is another example of SUNY Upstate fulfilling its mission of improving the health of the people we servethrough biomedical research,\" said SUNY Upstate PresidentGregory L. Eastwood, MD. \"We are very proud of Dr.Berenfeld and his colleagues, and the outstanding researchthey are doing.\" While looking for a reliable way to differentiate the source sustaining an arrhythmia during cardiac fibrillation,which often results from a single source located in a specificconfined region of the heart, Dr. Berenfeld and his SUNYUpstate team developed an innovative method that in the SUNY Upstate Medical University will open the Anxiety and Depressive Disorders Clinic Program in September. Theprogram will be the area's first adult program to offer clinicsthat specialize in treating anxiety, depression, a combinationof anxiety and depression, post-partum depression andtreatment-resistant depression.

The development wassupported by grants provided by theNational Heart, Lung and BloodInstitute, National Institutes of Health,and the American Heart Association. Arrhythmias are disorders of the regular rhythmic beating of the heart.According to the American HeartAssociation, they are common \u2014 asmany as 2.2 million Americans areliving with atrial fibrillation (one typeof rhythm problem). Arrhythmias can occur in a healthy heart and be ofminimal consequence. They also mayindicate a serious problem and lead toheart disease, stroke or sudden cardiacdeath. \"This licensing agreement is just one example of how ResearchFoundation expertise and guidancehelps convert SUNY-based technologyinto products, services and ventures,\"said Vice Chancellor John J.O'Connor, president of The ResearchFoundation of SUNY. \"Ourtechnology transfer team plays apivotal role in managing and nurturingSUNY ideas and discoveries to a stagewhere they can grow into commer-cially viable opportunities.\" The Technology Transfer Office (TTO) of the Research Foundation,created to identify and protectUniversity-developed intellectual pro-perty, worked out terms of theagreement with Biosense Webster. Theoffice serves as a catalyst for economic growth by creating partnerships withbusiness and industry to furtherresearch and license inventions forpublic use. The Research Foundation ranks in the top 20 of U.S. patent-generatingeducational institutions. As of the endof fiscal 2004, more than 700 patentshave been issued to the ResearchFoundation as a result of sponsoredprogram activity, with inventionsgenerating almost $13.4 million inroyalties in fiscal 2004. According tothe latest data available from theAssociation of University TechnologyManagers, SUNY is ahead of researchuniversities like the University ofMichigan and John Hopkins forroyalties earned on inventions. Information about SUNY technologies available for licensing isavailable at the Research Foundation'sTechnology Transfer Web site. said Dr. Schwartz. \"There is no other current program in the region thatoperates in this fashion.\" Dr. Schwartzis assistant professor of psychiatry anddirector of the Adult Psychiatry Clinicand the Anxiety and DepressiveDisorders Clinic Program at SUNYUpstate Medical University. Each clinic will offer an innovative method of treatment by combiningclinical, evidence-based, and researchstandards, unlike other approachesthat offer clinical care solely. \"From time to time, our clinics will engage in research studies with newmedications, psychotherapies andother treatment options,\" said Dr.Schwartz. \"Our patients will beinformed of the studies and will havethe opportunity to participate, if theychoose. For example, we will be the first clinic in the Syracuse area to offerVagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) for thetreatment of chronic depression. Wewere a research site for thispacemaker-like device and now, afterFDA approval, we will begin to offer itas a treatment option.\" According to Dr. Schwartz, physicians, nurses and other healthcare providers from SUNY Upstatewill provide the medical/psychiatriccare. \"Our patients will be involved in all treatment decisions based on theirunderstanding of our treatmentmodules which will be very specificinterventions geared to alleviatedepressive symptoms,\" said Dr.Schwartz. \"This way, our providersand their patients work collaborativelyto develop a more personalized treatment method with the goal ofimproving anxiety and/or depressivesymptoms. Our ultimate goal is forthe patient to achieve full remission ofsymptoms.\" Patients will choose from a variety of treatment modules includingpsychotherapies, such as dynamic,cognitive behavioral, supportive oreclectic, used soley, or in combinationwith medications.
