It is believed to be one of the oldest forms of medicine, and its use can be traced back thousands of years. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on the belief that the body is composed of energy, or Qi, which flows through the body. Imbalances or disruptions in this energy can lead to illness. Chinese herbal medicine uses a variety of plants and herbs to restore balance to the body, and to help treat lingering cold symptoms. There are a number of Chinese herbs that can be used to treat cold symptoms. For example, ginseng is often used as an immune system booster to help the body fight off infection. Other herbs such as astragalus and reishi mushroom are often used to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation. Licorice root can be used to soothe sore throats and reduce congestion. The herb magnolia is believed to help reduce fever, while ginger can help reduce nausea and vomiting. Chinese herbal medicine is often used in conjunction with other forms of treatment, such as acupuncture and massage. It can also be used to treat the underlying cause of the cold, such as allergies or a weakened immune system. Herbal treatments are generally safe and do not have the same side effects as prescription drugs. However, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional before taking any herbs or supplements. If you are suffering from lingering cold symptoms, Chinese herbal medicine may be able to help.
