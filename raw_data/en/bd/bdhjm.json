Introduction Noncommunicable diseases (NCD) include cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity. They represent a major part of morbidity and mortality worldwide (1). In Switzerland, over 2 million people live with at least one NCD (2) and, in 2013, NCD represented 80% of total health costs in Switzerland (2). Importantly, the trend should increase due to the aging of the Swiss population. At the same time, environmental degradation is steadily increasing and our current way of life is overusing the reso urces available to us. An unhealthy diet is the most important risk factor for NCD , accounting for 11 million deaths and 255 million disability -adjusted life -years worldwide (3). Our current global diet is also not compatible with living within the planeta ry carrying capacity ( 4, 5). National and international dietary guidelines have been issued, which provide guidance for healthy eating and prevention of NCD (see for instance (4 -6)). In Switzerland, dietar y guidelines have been issued (8, 9 ), and an update of the scientific evidence linking foods and NCD was published in 2019 (10 ). However, they do not contain information on the environmental impact of different food items. 1.2 Context Provision of safe and nutritious food is paramount to prevent the occurrence of NCD and ensure that people will remain healthy, with adequate intake of macro and micronutrients. To ensure an adequate provision of healthy, tasty, and safe foods to the general population, food production systems must be optimized. F urthermore, f ood production takes its toll on the environment, and some dietary guidelines have been found to be either unsustainable or to deleteriou sly impact the environment (6, 7 ). ). In order to achieve sustainable nutrition, both health and sustainability aspects should be considered and aligned. Sustainable nutrition recommendations must consider both aspects equally. 1.3 Objective This report updates and extends the previous one published by the Federal Commission for Nutrition (FCN) in 2019 (10 ). It was decided not to merge both reports as i nformation on several foods not included in the previous version is provided, as well as an appraisal of the ecological footprint of several food groups considered as important for the Swiss diet, and a commented review of the di etary guidelines of neighbour countries. The associations between each food group and the different NCD indicated above have been summarized in tables (the detailed search strategies can be found in the annex) . For each food, the conclusions are presented based on two criteria: class and level of evidence, a procedure that has b een used in other guidelines (11, 12 ), see table 1 next page . For example, a conclusion classified as IA will have the highest evidence, while a recommendation classified as IIC indicates conflicting results and evidence. As in the 2019 report, the target population was healthy adults (aged 18+ years); younger people or specific c onditions (i.e., pregnancy, lactation, and disease) were not considered. This report has four main parts. The first one (chapter 2) assesses the associations between foods and four NCD : CVD, cancer, T2D and obesity. The second part (chapter 3) assesses the ecological footprint of the production of foods commonly consumed in Switzerland. The third part (chapter 4) compares the current Swiss dietary guidelines with those of neighbouring countries and major international organizations. The fourth part (chapter 5) lists the foodstuffs important for the Swiss nutritional guidelines. This collaborative work is the task of researchers from all over Switzerland, who joined efforts to summarize a large body of literature and data for the updating of the Swiss dietary guidelines. The authors hope that their efforts will benefit the Swiss population and lead the path to a healthier, sustainable diet. 12 Table 1: Classes and evidence levels of the conclusion Class Definition I Evidence and/or general agreement that a given food is beneficial II Conflicting evidence and/or divergence of opinion about the benefits of the food III Evidence that the food, consumed in excessive amounts, is deleterious Level Definition A Data derived from multiple randomized controlled trials or meta -analyses B Data derived from a single randomized controlled trial or multiple prospective studies C Experts' agreement and/or retrospective or case -control studies Adapted from (13). 1.4 References 1.

DOI: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehw106. 14 2 Link between diet noncommunicable diseases 2.1 Water Authors: Introduction \"Water of drinking quality is defined in the Swiss food legislation as either mineral water, i.e., microbiologically irreproachable water from underground layers or deposits and is extracted from a source accessible through one or more natural or artificial outlets, or as spring water. This is water of subterranean origin which is marketed while preserving its original state \" (1). Safe drinking -water is considered to be essential to sustain life, resulting in benefits to health (2). The Swiss d ietary guidelines recommend the consumption of 1-2 litres of unsweetened beverages per day (3) . This can be consumed in various forms, such as tap water, mineral water, unsweetened herbal teas ( 3-4). The 2019 FCN report (1) highlights that \"water is increa singly being identified as playing a key role in chronic disease prevention (5, 6), in particular for chronic kidney disease (7, 8), nephrolithiasis (7), cardiovascular disease (9), obesity (10, 11) and type 2 diabetes (12). In this report, the focus was on updating the evidence of the relationship between non -communicable diseases ( i.e., cardiovascular diseases, all types of cancer, diabetes, and obesity) and water consumption, including mineral water and green tea . Some findings regardin g contaminated wat er have also been included as they appeared possibly relevant for Switzerland (e.g. nitrate from agriculture in drinking water) . 2.1.2 Search strategy We conducted a search strategy in the database PubMed and Cochrane, including \"water\" as the intervention and NCD as outcomes (\"cancer\", \"cardiovascular system\", \"diabetes\", etc.) formulated as MeSH terms, as free text, and as text in the title or abstract. We applied filters for human subjects, adult population, English language, publication years 2018 -2021, and study design (review, systematic review, meta -analysis, RCT). The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.1 . We retrieved and included 11 full -text articles. 2.1.3 Main findings 2.1.3.1 Cardiovascular diseases A meta -analysis and a RCT focused on the relationship between two different forms of water and cardiovascular health. The meta -analysis reported that daily consumption of high hydrogen water improved the endothelial function of arteries or arterioles (13). The RCT showed that regular consumption of green tea had cardiovascular protective effects, whereas hot water did not induce significant changes (14). 2.1.3.2 Cancer Two meta -analysis and a RCT studied the association between contaminated water and the generation of different types of cancer. Except for the first study (15) which found a positive association between water nitrate and colorectal cancer risk, the other two showed no association between nitrate - and fluoride -contaminated tap water and carcinogenic risk (16, 17). 2.1.3.3 Diabetes Two randomized -controlled trials and a meta -analysis of RCTs studied the effects of water/mineral water, alkaline water vs. neutral water and water vs . sucrose -sweetened beverages (SSB) on glycaemic parameters. The meta -analysis reported that results are heterogeneous, howev er that there is low evidence on water/mineral water to improve parameters in diabetic and non -diabetic persons (18). Despite the evidence reported in the first RCT (14) showing a positive effect of alkaline water on diabetic parameters, the study found no association between pH -changed water and neutral water on glucose 15 regulation. The second RCT reported a positive effect of water on post -drink plasma glucose on the contrary of sucrose -sweetened beverages (19). 2.1.3.4 Obesity Three RCTs evaluated the effects of water vs. artificially sweetened beverages (ASB), water accompanied to food, and water vs. diet beverages (DB) respectively. Water intake compared to LCS beverages did not differ in the total energy intake (13). Drinking water during the consumption of a m eal did increase blood glucose level causing chronic disorders such as obesity in contrast to consuming it 30 minutes before or after the meal (4). The third RCT revealed the positive effects of water on decreasing the BMI compared to DB (20). 2.1.4 Conclusion There is a dearth of studies regarding the positive/negative effects of water on NCD . Furthermore, the interpretation of the findings depends on the specific study since the intervention studies dealt with contaminated water ( e.g., nitrate in water) or a comparison of other types of beverages to water. Hence, a general trend cannot be drawn given the scarcity and the specificity of studies. Furthermore, no statements can be made about the recommended amount of water. Table 2: Summary water intake and risk of NCD Conclusion Class Level High H 2 water and green tea consumption have protective effects on cardiovascular health I B Nitrate and fluoride in water might be associated with cancer II A Water, alkaline water, and mineral water do not seem to have positive effects on glycaemic parameters II B Drinking water before or after the meal might be beneficial in weight reduction I B 2.1.5 Recommendations As in the previous FCN report (22), we found very few studies on the effect of water or fluid intake on NCD. Besides the deleterious effect of nitrates, no minimum or maximum amounts could be obtained.

Suzanne Suggs, Camilla Speranza Reviewer: Beatrice Baum er 2.2.1 Introduction Coffee beverage is made by infusing or percolating water with roasted and ground beans from the Coffea plant (1). The association between coffee and different health outcomes is not uniform. This is likely because research on coffee was his torically done from a toxicological point of view, hence the focus on a hypothesis linking high dosage to negative outcomes. More recent studies have shifted the perspective of consumption of coffee and potential benefits. The previous FCN report indicated that, for adult male and non -pregnant women, drinking up to 4 cups/day of coffee (400 mg caffeine/day) has no harmful effects on health and it may even have protective effects on NCD (2). In this report, we focus on the outcomes for all types of cancer, c ardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and obesity. The target population was healthy adults; no information on other populations such as children and pregnant women was collected. 2.2.2 Search strategy To find relevant literature, we developed the search strategy for the database PubMed, including the term on the intervention (\"coffee\") and the outcomes (\"cancer\", \"cardiovascular system\", \"diabetes\", etc.) formulated as MeSH terms and as free text. We ap plied filters for human subjects, adult population, English language, publication years 2018 -2021, and study design (review, systematic review, meta - analysis, and randomized controlled trial). The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.2 . We downloaded the retrieved references in the reference software Zotero, and after the deduplication, we screened the titles and abstracts. We retrieved 178 full -text articles for full -text screening, and finally included 57 studies in the review. Several articles prov ided information on more than one outcome. 2.2.3 Main findings 2.2.3.1 Cardiovascular diseases The two systematic reviews and meta -analysis and the three narrative reviews reported mostly inversely associations between coffee and risk of CVD. Coffee does not appear to b e harmful, and it generally has protective effects on CVD outcomes (3 -7). The diverse CVD outcomes taken into consideration in these studies were stoke, coronary heart diseases, heart failure and arrhythmia. 2.2.3.2 Cancer The twenty -four systematic reviews, meta -analyses, umbrella review, and the five narrative reviews showed a diverse pattern of results depending on the type of cancer. There is evidence for a protective effect of coffee on liver cancer (8 -13), breast cancer in postmenopausal women (8, 14 -16), end ometrial cancer (9, 17), skin carcinoma (18, 19), and there may be a protective effect for brain cancer (20, 21), oral cancer (22) and thyroid cancer (23). There is no association, or controversial and confounding evidence on colorectal cancer (8, 24 -27), prostate cancer (8, 28) and ovarian cancer (8, 29 -31). Coffee showed to have some harmful effects, and to potentially function as risk factor for pancreatic cancer (8, 32-34) and for bladder cancer (8, 35, 36), even though for the latter, more evidence is needed controlling for smoking habits. 2.2.3.3 Diabetes The two systematic reviews and meta -analysis, the narrative review and the randomized controlled trial showed that coffee had no significant effect on T2D, but mostly that it may have a protective effect on i t (4, 37 -39). 2.2.3.4 Obesity The systematic review, the narrative review and the randomized controlled trial showed evidence of a modest association between coffee and reduce obesity (37, 40, 41). 21 2.2.4 Conclusion The evidence for the beneficial effects of coffee on health outcomes vary by type of outcome, but it is generally positive. A picture emerges showing that coffee might have beneficial effects on several cancers (especially liver cancer), cardiovascular hea lth, diabetes, and a modest effect on obesity, especially the green coffee beans. The controversial associations with certain type of cancer, and the potentially detrimental effect for other cancers like pancreatic and bladder cancer need to be further confirmed and studied. Coffee is also generally associated with lower risks of all -cause mortality. Even though many studies discerned between the doses of coffee consumed, the different type of coffee and the coffee processing should be better integrated in the future studies, taking into consideration other risk factors such as age, sex, smoking patterns, and other life habits. The focus of the evidence review was on studies of coffee consumption and not on the preparation of coffee, in particular milk and s ugar. Evidence regarding dairy and SSBs, and their relationship with NCD , can be found in chapters 6.8 and 6.3, respectively. In this report, depending on the type of outcome, the association was found to be positive, neutral, or negative. Overall, there was no evidence for a detrimental effect of coffee on health, with exception of a possible positive association between coffee and certain types of cancer. Several associations between coffee and specific outcomes were neutral or even protective, but the causality was often not possible to prove, especially because of the large amount of confounding variables that need to be taken into consideration, such as coffee preparation, stress levels, physical activity or smoking habits. Table 5: Summary coffee intake and risk of NCD Conclusion Class Level Coffee generally has protective effects on CVD outcomes I B Coffee may be a protective factor for several cancers like liver cancer, breast cancer in postmenopausal women, endometrial cancer, skin carcinoma, prostate cancer, brain cancer, oral cancer and thyroid cancer I A Coffee showed confounding and controversi al effects on colorectal and ovarian cancer II A Coffee showed a potential harmful effect for pancreatic and bladder cancer III A Coffee might have a protective effect on T2D II A Coffee might affect weight in a moderate way II B 2.2.5 Recommendations According to the latest evidence, a moderate consumption of coffee (up to 4 cups per day) can be considered potentially beneficial for many types of cancer (liver cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, melanoma cancer, breast cancer ( in postmenopausal women), brain cancer and thyroid cancer), CVD and T2D. There is not enough evidence regarding obesity, even though it is hypothesized a modest positive association between coffee consumption and loss of weight. There is a contraindication of coffee consumption regarding bladder cancer and pancreatic cancer, for which an inverse association has been found. Regarding pancreatic cancer, evidence suggests a maximum consumption up to 3 cups per day. 22 Table 6: Estimation of optimal amount (cups/day) of coffee intake in relation to NCD *. NCD Optimal consumption CVD The intake of coffee, particularly in moderate doses (2 -3 cups/day), does not appear to be harmful for cardiovascular con ditions. On the contrary, habitual coffee consumption of 3 -5 cups/day was associated with a 15% reduction in the risk of CVD (compared to non-consumers). Cancer Liver cancer Higher coffee consumption was associated with lower HCC risk (HR >3 cups/day vs. non p for trend<0.0001 ) Prostate cancer A reduction in the risk of prostate cancer of nearly 1% was observed for each increment of one cup of coffee per day Bladder cancer Increased risk between high (ar ound>4 cups/day) coffee consumption and bladder cancer Endometrial cancer One-cup increment per day was associated with 3% risk reduction (95% CI: 2 -4%) in cohort studies Pancreatic cancer The risk of pancreatic cancer was increased by 5.87% (RR: 1.06; 95% CI 1.05 -1.07) with the increment of one cup/day. A useful guide would be 3 cups/day. Melanoma cancer An increase in coffee consumption of one cup per day was associated with a 3% reduction in melanoma risk (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.95-0.99). H igher the dose, up to 3 cups per day, lower the risk). Breast cancer (postmenopausal women) For every two cups of coffee consumed per day, the risk of breast cancer decreased by 2% (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97 -1.00). Brain cancer Every one cup of coffee per day decrea ses the risk of glioma by 3% (RR: 0.97 CI 0.94, 0.99), p= 0.016, P non-linearity = 0.054) Thyroid cancer The occurrence of TC was reduced by 5% with each one -cup increment of coffee consumption (up to 7 cups a day). T2D Mild-moderate coffee consumption (up to 4 cups/day), is associated with beneficial effects on hypertension and diabetes mellitus, with a risk decrease of T2D by 6% for each coffee cup -per-day. Obesity Higher coffee intake (from 4 to 6 cups/day) might be modestly associated wi th reduced obesity and modest loss of FM. * Contrary to the other food groups, no estimations regarding minimal or maximal consumption could be derived.23 Table 7: Results of the associations between coffee and health outcomes Reference Year Type Results Grade Cardiovascular disease (3) 2021 MA Coffee consumption reduces the risk of overall stroke, especially ischemic stroke. IA (4) 2021 NR Coffee reduces the risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, CVD and all -cause mortality. Studies included in this NR show that the major benefits are at 3 -5 cups/day. IB (5) 2020 SR/MA Limited and possible effects of coffee protective effects for CVD and its risk factors were found in the Korean population. IIA (6) 2018 NR Habitual coffee consumption of 3 -5 cups/day is associated with a 15% reduction in the risk of CVD (compared to non-consumers). There is no increased risk of CVD for those who already suffered a CVD event, even though more data are needed for people with hypertension. IB (7) 2019 NR The intake of coffee, particularly in moderate doses (2 -3 cups/day), does not appear to be harmful and may even be beneficial for cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart failure and arrhythmias. IB Cancer (8) 2021 NR Coffee intake is inversely associated with risk of hepatocellular cancer and, to a slight extent, risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women. The associations with oesophagus, pancreas, colon -rectum, kidneys, bladder, ovaries, and prostate, are less clear and conflicting. I/IIB (9) 2020 UR There is highly suggestive evidence for an inverse association between coffee intake and risk of liver and endometrial cancer. IA Liver cancer (10) 2020 MA/SR Drinking coffee provides benefits with a reduction in the risk of HCC or liver cancer. Higher doses of coffee (3 or more) have higher benefits in terms of risk reduction. IA (11) 2019 NR Evidence, with consistency across study designs and populations, suggests that coffee intake probably reduces the risk of liver cancer. Future research should establish the causality of the association. IB (12) 2019 NR Coffee lowers gastrointestinal and, especially, liver cancer risk in humans. IB (13) 2019 MA Coffee consumption among Japanese people has a significant role in preventing liver cancer. IA Colorectal cancer (24) 2020 NR/SR There are disparate results for any protective effect for coffee intake in colorectal cancer prevention. Certainty of evidence is very low. IIA 24 Reference Year Type Results Grade (25) 2018 MA Moderate coffee consumption (less than 3 cups/day) may not be associated or weakly inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer in the Japanese population. IIA (26) 2019 MA No evidence for the association between coffee consumption and colorectal cancer risk. When using pooled projects, the association between coffee consumption and colorectal cancer risk is controversial. IIA (27) 2019 SR/MA No significant relationship was detected between colorectal cancer and coffee. Ethnicity could explain the heterogeneity of the studies. IIA Prostate cancer (28) 2021 MA/SR Higher coffee consumption was significantly associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. IA Bladder cancer (35) 2018 MA Meta -analyses showed a 20% increase in risk of bladder cancer comparing the highest with the lowest consumption of coffee. Increasing intake of coffee were risk factors for bladder cancer. IIIA (36) 2020 SR There was an increased risk between high (around>4 cups/day) coffee consumption and bladder cancer among male smokers. No association among females and never smo kers. Smoke could be a confounding factor. IIIB Oral cancer (22) 2020 SR High vs low coffee intake was associated with a reduced risk of oral cavity cancer. High or intermediate coffee intake might have protective effects against oral cavity cancer. IA Endometrial cancer (17) 2018 MA Protective effect of coffee consumption on the risk of endometrial cancer. Increased coffee intake might be particularly beneficial for women with obesity. IA Pancreatic cancer (32) 2020 NR The evidence for the impact of coffee consumption on pancreatic cancer (PDAC) is rather mixed. In conclusion, PDAC patients could benefit, directly and indirectly, from drinking coffee. A useful guide would be 3 cups/day. IIB (33) 2019 MA The risk of pancreatic cancer was increased by 5.87% with the increment of one cup/day. Coffee consumption was related with the increasing risk of pancreatic cancer in a dose -response manner. IIIA (34) 2019 MA Little or no statistically significant assoc iation between coffee consumption and pancreatic cancer risk in never smokers. IIA Breast cancer 25 Reference Year Type Results Grade (14) 2018 MA Meta -analysis may support the hypothesis that coffee consumption is associated with decreased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. IA (15) 2021 MA The meta -analysis found a negative correlation between coffee intake and breast cancer risk, especially in postmenopausal and European women. IA (16) 2021 NR There is no association between coffee intake and breast cancer risk or a slight protective effect, even at high dosages. Coffee is inversely associated with breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. IB Melanoma cancer (18) 2018 MA An increase in coffee consumption of one cup per day was associated with a 3% reduction in melanoma risk. The study included up to 8 cups of coffee per day. Coffee intake may be inversely associated with incidence of melanoma. IA (19) 2018 MA Caffeinated coffee might have chemopreventive effects against basal cell carcinoma (non -melanoma skin cancer) dose dependently (higher the dose, up to 3 cups/day, lower the risk). IA Brain cancer (20) 2021 SR/MA Dose -response meta -analysis showed that for each cup of coffee per day (investigated range 0 -8 cups/day) there is a decrease in the risk of glioma by 3%. IA (21) 2019 MA Higher consumption of coffee may contribute to the lower development of brain cancer in Asian populations. IA Ovarian cancer (29) 2019 MA There was no statistically significant association between caffeine intake or different types of coffee and the risk of ovarian cancer. IIA (30) 2019 SR/MA No significant association was found between coffee intake and risk of ovarian cancer. There was an association between decaffeinated coffee consumption and risk of ovarian cancer. IIA (31) 2021 UR/ MA A positive correlation between coffee drinking and OC risk was found. Only four studies were taken into consideration for meta -analysis, so more evidence should be collected. IA Thyroid cancer (23) 2020 MA Coffee consumption was inversely associated with the TC occurrence in a linear dose -response manner (up to 7 cups/day). The occurrence of TC was reduced by 5% with each one cup increment of coffee consumption. IA Diabetes 26 Reference Year Type Results Grade (37) 2020 RCT Consuming 4 cups/day of caffeinated coffee for 24 weeks had no significant effect on change insulin sensitivity compared with placebo. IIB (4) 2021 NR Mild-moderate coffee consumption (2 -3 cups/day), is associated with beneficial effects on hypertension and diabetes mellitus. IB (38) 2018 SR/MA The risk of T2D decreased by 6% for each coffee cup -per-day (up to 5 cups/day were considered). Results were similar for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption. IA (39) 2021 SR/MA Drinking coffee (up to 4 cups) may be inversely associated with the risk of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. More research is needed considering type of coffee, substances added to coffee, and history of CVD. IIA Obesity (37) 2020 RCT Consuming 4 cups/day of caffeinated coffee for 24 weeks was associated with a modest loss of FM. IIB (40) 2019 MA The meta -analysis suggests that higher coffee intake (higher intake levels investigated 6 cups/day) might be modestly associated with reduced obesity , particularly in men. IIA (41) 2021 NR Coffee showed to exert anti -obesity effects in humans with several studies supporting the beneficial effects of coffee consumption toward obesity. However, several studies failed to show this effect. IIB CCS: Case 2.2.6 References 1. Esquivel P, Jim\u00e9nez VM. Functional properties of coffee and coffee by -products.

DOI: 10.3390/molecules26020453. 30 2.3 -sweetened beverages (SSBs) are defined as beverages containing added sugars or sweeteners such as high -fructose co rn syrup, sucrose, glucose, maltose, lactose, honey, malt syrup, molasses, raw sugar or fruit juice concentrates and include a variety of soft drinks, sodas, fruit drinks, energy drinks, and vitamin -water drinks. Artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs), me anwhile, are defined as liquids that contain non -nutritive artificial sweeteners (e.g., aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine) (1 -3). Despite this general definition for SSBs (and ASBs), there are differences in the scientific literature regarding serving sizes (from 250 to 330 ml) and types of beverages that are covered under the umbrella term SSB. In this review , articles on all types of SSBs (and ASBs) are included. Evidence on the health effects of fruit and vegetable juices is discussed elsewhere (see section \"Fruit juices\"). 2.3.2 Search strategy A literature search for suitable articles was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE up to September 2021. Search strings included a mixture of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms and text words to maximize identification of relevant articles. In addition, search filters by article type (Meta -analysis, systematic reviews, reviews and randomized controlled trials), spe cies (humans, healthy adults), language (English) and publication date (within the last 3 years) were applied . The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.3 . 2.3.3 Main findings Twenty -three (23) articles published in the last three years were included in the evaluation of the effects of SSBs regarding CVD, cancer, T2D and overweight/obesity. The majority of meta -analyses reported a harmful association between SSB consumption and the incidence of major non -communicable diseases and related health outcomes. 2.3.3.1 Cardiovascular disease Assessment of the health effects of SSB consumption indicated an overall positive association between high SSB intake and increased risk of CVD (overall CVD (4 -6); CVD mortality (6 -9); stroke (10, 11); coronary heart disease (10); hyper tension/increased blood pressure (12 -14) and heart failure (10). 2.3.3.2 Cancer While one meta -analysis found a positive association between SSB consumption and overall cancer risk (15), four meta -analyses reported positive (8, 15) or null associations (7, 9) for SSB -related cancer mortality. Heterogeneous findings were reported on the association of SSB consumption with the risk of different cancer types. While a consistent statistically significant positive association between SSB consumption and breast cance r was observed in two meta -analyses (15, 16), statistically significant positive associations and non -statistically significant positive tendencies were observed for HCC (15, 17) and colorectal cancer risk (15, 16, 18). Meta -analyses further found that a h igh consumption of SSBs may be associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer (16) and prostatic cancer mortality (15). With respect to pancreatic cancer risk, neither the association with SSB consumption based on cohort studies nor the association based on case -control studies reached statistical significance (19). This finding was in line with other meta -analyses suggesting no evidence for an association of SSB with pancreatic cancer risk (15, 16). While one meta -analysis reported a statistically s ignificant inverse association for SSB consumption and risk of glioma and non -cardia gastric cancer, no evidence for associations of SSB with oesophageal, gastric, renal, bladder, ovary, endometrial, pancreatic, hematopoietic, nasopharyngeal and biliary tr act cancer was found (15). 31 2.3.3.3 Diabetes There was an overall positive association between high SSB intake and increased risk of T2D (4, 5, 14, 20-23). 2.3.3.4 Obesity There was a positive association between SSB intake and overweight/obesity (5, 14, 24, 25). One 12 - month RCT in a population of habitual SSB consumers was found that showed no difference in body weight and fat mass with continued SSB consumption compared with replacing SSBs with either ASBs or unsweetened beverages. However, in the subgroup of individuals with central obesity , this replacement was associated with a decrease in body weight and fat mass (26). 2.3.4 Artificially -sweetened beverages Although not being the primary focus of this review, the health effects of ASBs, often considered a \"healthier alterna tive\" to SSBs, should be briefly mentioned here. Overall, although the number of meta - analyses was smaller, in line with the findings on SSBs, ASB consumption was associated with increased risk of CVD (overall CVD (4) ; CVD mortality (7 -9) and hypertension (14). Positive and null associations were observed for the association of ASBs with cancer mortality (7 -9). ASB consumption was associated with increased risk of T2D (4, 14, 21 -23), and obesity (14). These findings are consistent with those summarized in t he previous 2019 FCN report (27), stating that there is evidence for adverse health effects associated with the consumption of ASBs possibly involving mechanisms, such as alterations of food intake control by the brain and changes in the gut microbiota. Furthermore, it was concluded in the 2019 FCN report that ASBs should not be recommended as a substitute for SSBs as there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of replacing SSBs with ASBs. Instead, water should be the main source of fluid intake. 2.3.5 Conclusion Despite the indication of an overall positive association of SSBs with morbidity and mortality of the selected NCD , it must be considered that even though findings from different meta -analyses were largely consistent (with respect to CVDs, T2D and obesity) the certainty of evidence was rated as low or very low by the authors for the majority of meta -analyses and syste matic reviews included in this literature review. While most studies showed that high SSB consumption was detrimental to health compared with low SSB consumption, a few studies that examined dose -response associations suggested that even one SSB serving pe r day (250 to 330 ml) can lead to adverse health effects, indicating a possible dose - dependent association between SSBs and NCD . However, it should be noted that meta -analyses were mainly based on prospective cohort studies, and heterogeneity within the in cluded studies was often moderate to high. Therefore, conclusions drawn based on current evidence from epidemiological studies need to be done carefully and observed associations should not necessarily be considered causal. The present observations on the links between SSB intake and non -communicable disease risks are consistent with those summarized in the previous FCN report published in 2019, which covered the scientific evidence from literature published between 2012 and 2017. Further in -depth research (especially with respect to the association of SSBs and the risk of different cancer types) is needed to better understand the role of SSBs in the development and progress of NCD .

IIA of PCS SSB A meta -analysis of 13 cohorts showed an increase in hypertension risk when comparing highest to lowest SSB consumption (RR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.11 -1.23; I2=66%) and linear dose -response analysis found an increase in hypertension incidence with each 355 ml/day serving of SSB (RR per-355-ml: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.08 -1.12; I2=73%). Certainty of the evidence was reported to be low. IIIA (10) 2019 SR and MA of PCS SSB While a 10% increase in coronary heart disease risk 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01 -1.20; 95% CI: 1.01 -1.18; I2=0%) was found with high compared to low SSB intake, no association was observed with heart failure risk. Dose -response analysis showed a positive association of each additional 250 ml of SSB per day with the risk for coronary heart disease (RR: 1.17; IIA/IIIA (14) 2020 SR and MA of PCS SSB (and ASB) High vs. low SSB (and ASB) intake were significantly associated with increased hypertension risk. Dose -response meta -analysis reported that each 250 ml/day increment in SSB (and ASB) consumption was associated with a 10% (and 8%) increase in risk A meta -analysis of two studies showed a 19% increase in elevated blood pressure/hypertension risk with high SSB consumption in a Korean population (95% CI: 1.04 -1.36). IIIA (5) 2021 R of PCS SSB A qualitative literature review based on data from an Asian population found that a high level of SSB consumption was associated with a higher CVD risk, with heterogeneous findings for different types of CVD outcomes. IIIB 34 Ref.

IIIA (8) 2021 SR and MA of PCS SSB (and ASB) An increase in SSB (and ASB) consumption by 250 ml/day was associated with an increased risk of CVD morta lity (HR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02 -1.14; I2=70%), while the level of certainty of evidence was reported to be low. Dose -response association was observed to be non -linear. IIIA (9) 2021 SR and MA of PCS SSB (and ASB) Higher SSB (and ASB) consumption were positively associated with a higher risk for CVD mortality .

Reappraisal of the scientific evidence linking consumption of foods from specific food groups to non -communicable diseases. An expert report of the federal commission for nutrition ( FCN / EEK) Bern , December 2019. Bern, Switzerland: Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office; 2019 , 31 December. 41 2.4 Fruit Pedro Marques -Vidal, Esther Infanger 2.4.1 Introduction Since the WHO changed in 2015 their recommendation to limit the intake of sugars from added to free sugars, which include sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) naturally present in fruit juice and fruit juice concentrates, fruit juice became under scrutiny (1). Fruit juice is defined as: \"an unfermented, fermentable juice made from the edible parts of fresh or cold -preserved he althy and ripe fruits of one or more species. Fruit juice has the characteristic colour, aroma, and flavour of the fruit from which it is derived\". It is not allowed to add sugar to fruit juice. In contrast, \"Fruit nectar is an unfermented fermentable beverage produced by adding water, with or without added sugars or honey, to fruit juice, fruit jui ce from concentrate, fruit juice extracted from water, fruit juice concentrate, fruit pulp or concentrated fruit pulp, or a mixture thereof.\" (2). Food -based dietary guidelines are not consistent in the consumption recommendation of fruit juices (3). Many countries classify fruit juice within the fruit and vegetable group, but recommend moderation in consumption to not more than one serving of fruit juice accounted as fruit per day. However, in several countries, the classification of fruit juice and intake recommendation is unclear or undefined (3). In the Swiss Food Pyramid, juice is visually depicted in the vegetable and fruit level and in written recommendations, it is stated that of the five recommended portions of fruit and vegetables, one portion can be replaced by 2 dL vegetable or fruit juice without added sugars (4). In the expert report of the Federal Committee for Nutrition (FCN), it was summarized that literature does not support the assumption that one serving of fruit juice has health benefits comparable with whole fruits (5). It was therefore recommended to withdraw a possible replacement of one serving of fruit with one serving of fruit juice, and instead to group fruit juice together with sugar -sweetened beverages (SSB) and other sweets, salt y snacks, and alcoholic beverages at the top of the pyramid. For this level, a moderate consumption is recommended. 2.4.2 Search strategy We searched the databases PubMed and EMBASE to identify publications about the following NCD : CVD, cancer, T2D and obesity , and the food group \"fruit juice\" in combination. To identify relevant results, we set the following filters: humans, English, from 2018 onwards, reviews, systematic reviews and meta -analyses. We were able to identify 20 results for the title and abstract s creening, which we imported to the systematic review tool \"Rayyaan\". In the following full -text screening, we excluded 16 studies for meeting the exclusion criteria such as \"wrong outcome\", \"wrong food\" or \"wrong population\". At the end of this process, we found four eligible studies, which were used for this paper (further details are available in the document \"Syntax Fruit Juice\"). Another study from 2017 (6) was no t identified through this search because the term fruit juice was not mentioned in the titl e or abstract. However, as an included review and meta -analysis (1) analysed this review, it was not added separately. The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.4 . 2.4.3 Main findings Four reviews and meta -analyses of medium to high quality were included in this summary. 2.4.3.1 Cardiovascular disease A systematic review of meta -analyses from 2019 investigated the association between fruit consumption including fruit juice and chronic diseases and included seven articles with fruit juice (1). Fruit juice (unsweetened) was not associated with CVD. However, consumption of fruit juice was associated with a 33% reduced risk of total stroke. No association was found for the following risk factors of CVD: total cholesterol, LDL -C, HDL -C, and systolic blood press ure, while there was a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 2.07 mm Hg (1). 42 2.4.3.2 Cancer In the systematic review of meta -analyses from (1), fruit juice (unsweetened) was not associated with total cancers, or risk of colon cancer or breast cancer . 2.4.3.3 Diabetes One systematic review and meta -analysis investigated the association between SSB and fruit juice with T2D (7). It included 13 studies with fruit juice. A higher consumption of fruit juice was associated with an increased incidence of T2D by 5% before obesi ty adjustment and by 7% after obesity adjustment per one serving per day. However, the positive association varied by study design and study inclusion criteria. Furthermore, potential publication bias and residual confounding were likely to exist and there fore, evidence for fruit juice was rated as low. Hence, it was evaluated that for fruit juice the effect was non -significant after excluding any single study supporting the positive association. The authors concluded that fruit juices are unlikely a health y alternative compared to the consumption of SSB for the prevention of T2D (7). A recent systematic review of meta -analyses from (1) found that fruit juice (unsweetened) was not associated with T2D. However, fruit juice consumption was associated with an i ncreased HOMA -IR index of 0.595 (an indicator of insulin resistance). No association was found f or fasting glycaemia or insulina emia. In contrast, compared with 100% fruit juice consumption, the consumption of fruit nectar (sweetened fruit juices) was asso ciated with a significantly increased (28%) risk of T2D (1). 2.4.3.4 Obesity One systematic review investigated the association of fruit consumption including fruit juice and obesity status in adults (8). The included five RCTs added fruit and fruit juice (up to 500 ml/d) to the diet under isocaloric conditions and found no significant effect on weight gain. However, small sample sizes and inconsistency in results limited the strength of evidence. Further, five RCTs compared different fruits and among them, different fruit juices but again, the results were methodologically weak because, for example, energy intake was not reported. The prospective cohort studies either did not include f ruit juice or did not differentiate in the results between whole fruits and fruit juice. The only study that specifically investigated fruit juice was based on three large cohort studies and found an increased weight gain with fruit juice consumption alrea dy at one serving per day (9); this study was also included in the review from Fardet et al. (1). Hebden et al. concluded a reduced long -term risk of obesity with increasing fruit consumption or a nonsignificant association and in contrast, a weight gain p romoting long term effect of fruit juice (8). The systematic review of meta -analyses from (1) indicated that consumption of fruit juice was associated with a significant weight gain of 0.22 kg per standard serving (i.e., generally 125 mL) over 4 years, bas ed on the same review from Pan et al. (2013) as in the review by Hebden et al. (2017) above. In contrast, the consumption of whole fresh fruits was associated with a significantly decreased (17%) risk of obesity . No pooled analysis or meta -analysis was fou nd that assessed obesity , weight gain, or waist circumference in relation with nectar consumption. 2.4.3.5 Mortality A recently published analysis of two cohort studies and a meta -analysis of 26 cohort studies investigated the association between fruit and vegetab le intake and mortality (10). Subgroups such as fruit juices could be analysed separately. Higher intakes of fruit juices were not associated with mortality, contrary to a reduction of total mortality and cause -specific mortality attributable to cancer, CV D, and respiratory disease by the consumption of five servings a day of fruits and vegetables. Evidence was judged as high (10). 2.4.4 Conclusion Fardet et al. summarized that overall, whole fruits seem more protective against chronic diseases than fruit juice ( 1). The major limitation of this review was that the included studies did not always specify whether the fruit juices contained added sugars. It was stated that there is still a lack of high -quality 43 studies investigating the association between fruit proce ssing and health outcomes. Also Wang et al. (2021) pointed out that due to different health effects, fruit juices should not be grouped within the fruits and vegetable group and thus, their study does not support the current Dietary Guidelines for American s that include fruit juice in the fruit and vegetable group (10). The lowest dose that was indicated as detrimental for health was 125 ml/day, with an effect on weight gain, equal to one small serving (vs. 200 ml indicated as one serving in the Swiss Food Pyramid). Mechanistic explanations for the differences between whole fruits and fruit juices include a higher glycaemic load and a different nutrient composition including different (poly)phenol profiles and bioavailability (10, 11). It has to be noted tha t at current stage it cannot be answered whether there are differences within the fruit juice group, for example some juices such as dark -coloured, polyphenol -rich juices providing health benefits similar to their whole fruit counterparts (11). Table 11: Summary fruit juice intake and risk of NCD Conclusion Class Level Increasing fruit juice intake might reduce the risk of CVD II A Increasing fruit juice intake does not modify the risk of cancer II A Increasing fruit juice intake does not modify the risk of diabetes II A Increasing fruit juice intake increases the risk of obesity III A 2.4.5 Recommendations Associations between fruit juice consumption and CVD are inconsistent. While there is currently no indication that fruit juices provide the same health benefits as fruits and vegetables in exhibiting protective effects against CVD with high evidence, fruit juice reduced the ri sk for stroke with high evidence. Fruit juice does not provide protective effects against cancer with high evidence. Effects on T2D were neutral or slightly negative (increased risk factors) with moderate evidence. Increased fruit juice consumption of alre ady one small serving per day resulted in increased weight gain in adults with moderate evidence. Concluding, fruit juice does not provide positive health effects on the investigated NCD comparable with whole fruits except for a reduction in stroke. Therefore, they should not be included in the fruit and vegetable level of the Swiss Food Pyramid, in line with the recommendation of the previous report of the FCN (5). The position of fruit juice in the Food Pyramid has to be revi sed. Vegetable juice is consumed in much lower amounts compared to fruit juice and there are insufficient data to conclude on health effects. However, a similar situation to fruit juice is assumed.

Reviewer: Undine Lehmann 2.5.1 Introduction The term vegetables usually refers to the edible parts of plants, including roots, stems, and stalks, as well as flowers and grains that are used as vegetables. With the term fruits, we usually refer to the edible parts of plants, trees, bushes, or vines that contain seeds and pulpy tissue and usually have a sweet or tart taste. While fruit and vegetable composition depend on various factors, they are good sources of dietary fibre, a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, and other bio -active compounds (1). The current Swiss food pyramid recom mends the daily consumption of 3 portions of vegetables and 2 portions of fruits (portion size ~120 g) (2). This report complements the previous FCN report on the association between fruits and vegetables and NCD (3). 2.5.2 Search strategy A literature search wa s conducted in PubMed and EMBASE (10/08/2021). We imposed no limitations on the type of fruit and vegetables included in this review. Articles that reported results on fruit and vegetables (as an overall category), individual types (e.g., citrus fruits), o r individual fruits or vegetables (e.g., tomato) were retained. Articles only focusing on fruit or vegetable extracts, compounds within fruits or vegetables, whole dietary patterns (e.g., the Mediterranean diet), or juices were excluded. The studies mainly focused on adult populations and the outcomes reported below. The search was limited to humans, articles published in 2018 or later, and written in English. The syntax for the literature search in both databases is provided as supplementary material. Addi tional studies were identified through external sources and were added to the evidence pool. The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.5 . 2.5.3 Main findings Thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Most studies reported an inverse association between fruit and/or vegetable intake and the selected non -communicable disease morbidity and mortality. In these studies, the pattern of associations was consistent and in the same direction. 2.5.3.1 Cardiovascular disease The studies identified by ou r literature search that met our inclusion criteria reported evidence of an inverse association between higher fruit and/or vegetable consumption and the risk for coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality (4, 5). 2.5.3.2 Cancer Higher f ruit and/or vegetable intake was inversely associated with the risk for different cancers, including colorectal (6), liver (vegetable intake (7)), and lung (8) cancers. In contrast, higher chili pepper intake was associated with increased risk for gastric cancer (9). Some of the included studies contradicted the previous results, reporting instead non -significant/null associations (10, 11). The study by Fardet et al., specifically, that mostly reported null associations, focused on the level of processing o f fruits (e.g., whole fruits, dried fruits, canned fruits) (12). Based on their aim, they excluded various studies in which the level of processing was not reported, so their results might not be representative of the entire literature on fruit and vegetab le consumption and their relationships with health outcomes. Differential results were reported in some studies across different vegetable subtypes or personal/study characteristics. The results on colorectal cancer, when assessed by study type, remained s ignificant for case -control, but not for cohort studies (8). An inverse association between fruit intake and lung cancer risk was seen in current ( -14% risk) and former ( -9% risk) smokers, while it appeared not statistically significant for never smokers w here heterogeneity was seen between studies (I2=27.2%) (8). A 40% and a 20% decrease in cervical cancer risk was observed in women with the highe st intake of vegetables and fruits respectively, compared to the lowest category. However, when human papilloma virus (HPV) 47 infection was considered, the association was evident only in studies without HPV adjustment, suggesting that HPV infection may have confounded the observed associations (13). Regarding the results for liver cancer, subgroup analysis suggested an inverse association between vegetable intake and liver cancer in males, but not females, while no differences were observed by region and mean age of participants (7). While a non -significant inverse association between vegetable intake and HCC was reported in one of the identified studies, specific vegetable subgroups were reported to have significant inverse associations, indicating a protective effect against HCC (14). 2.5.3.3 Diabetes Higher fruit and vegetable consumption was also associated with lower T2D (green leafy and cruciferous vegetables (15) risk. 2.5.3.4 Obesity Higher fruit and vegetable consumption was also associated with lower obesity and weight gain (10, 12, 16). 2.5.4 Conclusion Most studies reported beneficial associations between fruit and vegetable intake and the selected non - communicable disease morbidity and mortality. Most associations remained the same in subgroup analyses, with some showing differential results depending on specific characteristics (e.g., sex, smoking status). The studies explor ing the nature of the association reported a nonlinear increase in benefits with increasing intake. The beneficial effects of consumption of 2 servings of fruits and 3 servings of vegetables per day, and the existing food -based dietary recommendation, ar e supported by the current literature. Due to the heterogeneity between studies (and the comparison high vs. low, presented in many), it was difficult to determine a minimal, optimal, or maximal consumption with respect to cancer and T2D. All studies, exce pt for one, were performed without specific details on the degree of processing. More studies on the topic are needed before considering differentiating the recommendation on fruits and vegetables by the degree of processing.

DOI: 10.1017/S1368980021000823. Introduction The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) proposes a reference intake range of 45 to 60% of total energy intake for carbohydrates, applicable to both adults and children older than one year of age (1). In the Swiss Food Pyramid, cereal products, potatoes a nd pulses are combined in one level with a recommendation of 3 portions daily, the cereals preferably as WG (2). However, as pulses are also providing substantial amounts of protein, they are not discussed in this chapter but in the review of protein sourc es (meat, fish, eggs, vegetable sources) as also recommended in the previous Federal Commission for Nutrition (FCN) report (3). The current review is an update of the expert r eport of the FCN from 2019 (3). The term \"whole grain\" (WG) was defined by differ ent health authorities. Generally, it refers to the intact, ground, cracked or flaked kernel after the removal of inedible parts such as the hull and husk. The principal anatomical components the starchy endosperm, germ and bran are present in the same relative proportions as they exist in the intact kernel (4). However, the term \"whole grain food\" is not well defined and therefore, studies use different definitions, which makes comparison difficult (1, 4). Grains that are included in the whole grain defini tion are cereal grasses, wheat, rice, barley, maize, rye, oats, millet, sorghum, teff, triticale, canary seed, Job's tears, and fonio, and the pseudocereals amaranth, buckwheat, quinoa, and wild rice (4, 5). Cereals (i.e. wheat, rye, barley, millet ...) and starchy foods (i.e. potatoes, bread, pasta...) contain as main ingredient carbohydrates, the major source of energy in the diet. In addition to their carbohydrate content, cereals and starchy foods are an important source of dietary fibres and micronutrien ts (3). 2.6.2 Search strategy We searched the databases PubMed and EMBASE to identify publications about non -communicable diseases ( NCD ) (cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes and obesity ) and the food groups whole grains, cereals and starchy foods in combination. To identify relevant results we set the following filters: humans, English, publication from 2018 onwards, reviews, systematic reviews and meta -analysis. We were able to identify 42 results ( -2 duplicates) for the title and abstract screening, which we imported to systematic Review Tool \"Rayyaan\". In the following full -text screening, we excluded 26 studies for meeting the exclusion criteria such as \"wrong outcome\", \"wrong food\" o r \"wrong population\". At the end of this process, we found 15 eligible studies, which were used for this review. An additional review was retrieved and included after the search. As there were reviews of RCTs available, we did not include single RCTs in th e searc h and evaluation. The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.6 . 2.6.3 Main finding Fifteen reviews and meta -analyses and one evidence mapping review were included in this summary. Compared to the previous expert report of the FCN from 2019 (3), in par ticular new evidence about the effects of potatoes on health could be retrieved. Evidence was separately evaluated for potatoes, whole grain and refined grains as key foods of the cereals and starchy food group. 2.6.3.1 Cardiovascular disease A recent systematic review and meta -analysis investigated the association between potato intake and risk of NCD based on 28 studies (6). Total potato consumption showed no associations with coronary heart disease (CHD) (RR: Consumption of one daily serving of boiled/baked/mashed -potatoes was not associated with risk of hypertension (RR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.96 -1.21). (RR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.15 -1.63) were observed for each 150 g/day increase in French fries' consumption. This rather high amount for French fries consumption was chosen as it facilitated comparison with potatoes. The quality of evidence of this r isk association was rated moderate. 56 An evidence mapping review of 121 observational studies investigated the association between potato consumption and risk of cardiometabolic diseases (7). No association was found between potato intake and CVD incidence, stroke or myocardial infarction or CVD mortality. When studies that reported potato intake as part of a dietary pattern were summarized, all 3 studies found an increase in cardio -metabolic risk factors [e.g., blood insulin, body mass index (BMI)] with diet ary patterns that included French fries or potato chips, but not with the dietary pattern that included baked or boiled potatoes (7). For the association between CVD and whole grain intake, one systematic review compared whole grain, bran and cereal fibre intake in relation with CVD (8). Whole grain intake was associated with lower CVD mortality and lower risk for coronary heart disease. Another systematic review and meta -analysis investigated risk factors for CVD in relation to whole grain or refined grain or placebo consumption in RCTs and found a decrease in certain risk factors for CVD (total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, haemoglobin A1c, C -reactive protein) after whole grain consumption (9) (not included in Table 18 ). 2.6.3.2 Cancer One systematic review and dose -response meta -analysis investigated the association between potato consumption and cancer mortality based on 20 cohort studies (10). The association between potato consumption and cancer mortality was nonsignificant (1 0). Another systematic review and meta -analysis by the same authors investigated the association between potato consumption and site -specific cancers (11). Potato or potato preparations consumption was not associated with multiple cancer sites when compari ng high and low intake categories. Four meta -analyses investigated the association between whole grain intake and either specific cancer (breast (12), bladder (13), gastric (14)) or various site -specific cancer and total cancer mortality (15). The studies showed beneficial effects of whole grain consumption for reduction of cancer risk while for refined grains, evidence was inconclusive. 2.6.3.3 Type 2 Diabetes Several reviews and meta -analyses showed an increased risk and incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with increased potato intake in a dose -response manner. French fries' or fried potatoes exhibited a stronger detrimental effect (6, 7, 16, 17). In a dose -response meta -analysis of 13 studies, the consumption of fried potato was associated with a 34% incre ased risk for T2D for each 80 g/day increase, while it was 10% for total potato and 2% for unfried potato (16). An umbrella review of various dietary factors on the risk of T2D found out that high whole grain intake significantly decreased the risk of T2D, with pooled RR ranging every 30 g/day increase in whole grain intake significantly reduced the risk of T2D around 13% (pooled RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.82 -0.93). In contrast to whole grain, high intake of refined grains was not associated with risk of T2D (18). 2.6.3.4 Obesity One evidence mapping review investigated the effects of potato consumption on obesity or body weight related measures (7). Potato intake increased the risk of obesity in 2 out of 4 studies and increased BMI or body weight in 5 out of 6 studies. When dietary patterns were investigated, patterns which included French fries found an increase in BMI whereas patterns that included baked or boiled potatoes did not find an increase (7 ). Three meta -analysis and a systematic review investigated the link between whole grain consumption and body weight related measures. The two systematic review and meta -analysis of RCTs had no agreement. While one review found that whole grain intake was associated with lower body weight in obese/ overweight subjects compared to a control group (19), another review found no effect on body weight or other anthropometric measures (20). A meta -analysis of observational studies and RCTs found a sign ificant, inverse correlation between whole grain intake and BMI in cross -sectional studies, weighted slope, 0.0141 kg/m2 r=0.526, P=0.0001) but not in RCTs up to 16 weeks (21). A recent systemati c review investigated how different 57 methods of reporting and calculating whole grain intake and the applied whole grain definition affect reported associations between whole grain intake and body weight measures (1). It was concluded that studies calculati ng whole grain intake using total grams of intake, USDA databases, or 25% whole grain in combination with listing specific foods, showed consistent beneficial effects of whole grain intake on body weight. Studies with general lists of foods included as \"w hole grain foods\" that are more unspecific or have lower cut -offs for WG content were inconsistent (1). 2.6.4 Conclusion New evidence indicated that total or unfried potato intake is not associated with CVD or cancer but a slightly higher risk of T2D and weight gain. In contrast, there is strong evidence that fried potato intake is associated with hypertension, T2D and weight gain. The review revealed new strong evidence for protective effects of WG consumption against cancer. A protective effect against weight g ain remains probable when foods rich in whole grain are consumed. For the food group of ready -to-eat (breakfast) cereals (RTEC), no study met the inclusion criteria for the review. However, there are indications that consumption of RTEC compared to breakfa st skipping is associated with higher micronutrient intake in children and adolescents (22). Furthermore, RTEC consumption was associated with higher fibre intake and a healthier eating pattern in children and adolescents but also associated with higher total sugar intake compared to non -RTEC consumers (23). Further studies would be necessary to give conclusive recommendations about this food group and poten tial differences between different kinds of breakfast cereals ( e.g., flakes, muesli, etc.). Mechanistic explanations about effects of starchy foods on health outcomes remain valid as described in the expert report of the FCN from 2019 (3).

The recommendation to consume three servings of cereals and starchy foods, as stated in the previous FCN report (3), remains valid. Consu mption of free sugars should still be as low as possible Within the cereal and starchy food group, recommendations about potatoes and cereals as major foods in this group can be made. New evidence indicates that potato intake in fried form is likely to be a risk factor for T2D and increased body weight and consumption should be limited. For boiled, baked or mashed potatoes, the association with detrimental health effects is less strong or inconclusive. Recent reviews indicated that whole grain intake was pr otective against CVD, certain cancers, risk for T2D and body weight increase. Added to previous evidence demonstrating protective effects against CVD, the recommendation to consume cereals preferably as whole grain can be confirmed. There is still lack of evidence about a concrete amount of whole grain exhibiting beneficial effects. However, as all available evidence points out that whole grain is more beneficial to health than refined grains, the recommendations to eat preferably whole grain if cereal is c onsumed can be supported.

Sabine Rohrmann Reviewer: Beatrice Baumer 2.7.1 Introduction Meat is a food rich in protein, minerals such as iron and zinc as well as a variety of vitamins, in particular B vitamins. Depending on the type of meat, i.e., red meat (beef, pork, sheep etc.) versus white meat (mainly poultry), however, the content of cholesterol and saturated fat is higher than in some other food groups. Processed meat, defined as products usually made of red meat, but also of poultry, that are cured, salted or smoked (e.g., ham or bacon) in or der to improve the shelf life, but also colour and taste. These products also often contain a high amount of minced fatty tissue (e.g., sausages). Hence, high consumption of processed meats and to a certain extend also unprocessed red meat may lead to an increased intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, salt, nitrite, haem iron, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and-depending upon the chosen food preparation method -also heterocyclic amines (1). Fish are considered a healthy food given its high content of high -quality protein and, in fatty fish, a higher content of long -chain n -3 fatty acids (2). However, the consumption of certain types of fish is associated with a higher intake of mercury and other heavy metals. Indeed, the consumption of saltwater fish and other seafood containing methylmercury is a leading source of mercury exposure (3). Eggs , in particular egg yolk, are rich in cholesterol and have therefore long been linked with an increased risk of CVD. However, the role of dietary cholesterol in the aetiology of CVD has been disputed in the past years, also given the fact that eggs are a source of vitamins, minerals, and high -quality protein (4). 2.7.2 Search strategy A systematic search was conducted to find publications . The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.7. If no relevant literature was found by the systematic search, a \"free\" search in PubMed was conducted. This free search led to some additional reviews on the topic that were also included in this review. 2.7.3 Main findings The German Nutrition Society (DGE) conducted an umbrella review on the health effects of meat consumption in their 2020 scientific report (5). Although positive associations of a high red and processed meat consu mption were observed for CVD, T2D and colorectal cancer, the level of evidence was general considered very low to low, with some exceptions of moderate evidence (Table 21). DGE only evaluated the evidence for colorectal and breast cancer, but no other canc er outcomes. Some publications evaluated other cancer outcomes (6, 7) , but only the World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute of Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) evaluated a larger number of cancer outcomes systematically (8). They concluded that there wa s convincing evidence of a positive association between processed meat consumption and risk of colorectal cancer and probable evidence for an association of red meat consumption with colorectal cancer risk. Although other systematic reviews come up with th e same associations, they rate the evidence for an association of meat consumption with colorectal cancer as lower compared with WCRF/AICR (9) given that fact that this evidence is based on observational studies only. Positive associations of high red and processed meat consumption were also seen for T2D (with low level of evidence). Only few prospective studies are available to evaluate the association of meat consumption with obesity. In contrast to red and processed meat, white meat is generally not asso ciated with increased risk of CVD, cancer, or T2D (see Table 2 2). Fish consumption has less frequently been studied in association with the risk of chronic diseases (Table 2 3). CVD mortality was observed to be inversely associated with fish consumption (7) . WCRF/AICR concluded that limited evidence is available for a decreased risk of liver cancer with higher fish consumption (see also (6)), but there was no evidence for any other cancer type (8). The associations with T2D and obesity tend to be quite heterogeneous and based on a small number of studies. 65 The association of egg consumption with risk of cardiovascular diseases appears to depend on the amount of eggs consumed and the outcome ( Table 2 4). Similarly, the associations for T2D are rat her heterogeneous and the quality of evidence is considered low. WCRF/AICR did not draw any conclusion on the association between egg consumption and cancer risk because of too few, too small or too inconsistent results (8). No associations with obesity we re observed; however, the number of prospective studies is limited. 2.7.4 Conclusion 2.7.4.1 Conclusions of the previous report s The 2014 FCN report on meat concluded that consumption of unprocessed red meat and processed was associated with an increased risk of NCD , and more specifically of CVD, cancer and T2D (10). This conclusion remains supported by the recent scientific literat ure, and several nutritional agencies recently made specific recommendations. With respect to fish consumption, the previous report adopted the recommendations of WCRF/AICR (i.e., no recommendation for fish regarding cancer prevention, but WCRF/AICR mentio n recommendations for the prevention of other NCD [one to two times /week, one of which should be a fatty fish]). No conclusions on egg consumption were drawn. The 2019 FCN report agreed with these conclusions, but added that more attention should be paid t o a diversification of protein sources, including proteins of plant origin. This pyramid level should be revised as soon as more data is available for proteins from alternative sources (e.g. insects, bio -engineered meat, and other novel food items derived from cellular agriculture). 2.7.4.2 Conclusion of the current report There is large evidence, though based on observational studies, that a high consumption of red and processed meat increases the risk of CVD, colorectal cancer and T2D. The evidence for other type s of cancer is positive for some, but rather limited. No convincing association are seen for obesity. Results for fish and egg consumption are rather heterogeneous and no firm conclusions can be drawn besides an inverse association between fish consumption and risk of CVD. For egg consumption, results are rather inconsistent, with uncertainties for the amount of eggs consumed and differences in results when looking at CHD and stroke. 66 Table 20: Summary meat, fish and eggs intake and risk of NCD Conclusion Class Level Red meat Increasing consumption of red meat increases the risk of CVD III A Increasing consumption of red meat increases the risk of cancer II/III A Increasing consumption of red meat increases the risk of T2D III A Increasing consumption of red meat might increase the risk of obesity II A Processed meat Increasing consumption of processed meat increases the risk of CVD III A Increasing consumption of processed meat increases the risk of cancer II/III A Increasing consumption of processed meat increases the risk of T2D III A Increasing consumption of processed meat might increase the risk of obesity II A White meat Increasing consumption of white meat might decrease the risk of CVD II A Increasing consumption of white meat might decrease the risk of cancer II A Increasing consumption of white meat might decrease the risk of T2D II A Increasing consumption of white meat might decrease the risk of obesity II A Fish Increasing consumption of fish decreases the risk of CVD I A Increasing consumption of fish might decrease the risk of cancer II A Increasing consumption of fish might decrease the risk of T2D II A Increasing consumption of fish might decrease the risk of obesity II A Eggs Increasing consumption of eggs might decrease the risk of CVD II A Increasing consumption of eggs might decrease the risk of cancer II A Increasing consumption of eggs might decrease the risk of T2D II A Increasing consumption of eggs might decrease the risk of obesity II A 67 2.7.5 Recommendations Table 21: Estimation of minimum, optimal, and maximum amount of red meat, processed meat, fish, and egg intake in relation to NCD Food group/ NCD Minimum Maximum Optimal Red 0 g/day T2D every 100 g/day increase in intake of red meat significantly increased the risk of T2D with pooled RRs of 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08 -1.26) Obesity 0 g/day 100 0 g/day T2D every 50 g/day increase in intake of processed meat significantly increased the risk of T2D with pooled RRs of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.22 -1.55) Obesity 0 g/day 0 g/day 0 g/day White meat CVD - - - Cancer - - - T2D - - - Obesity - - - Fish CVD >0 g/day 90 g/day 50 g/day Cancer - - - T2D - - - Obesity - - - Eggs CVD 0 5 per day 1 per day Cancer - - - T2D 1 per week 2 per week 1 per week Obesity - - - -, not reported. 68 Table 22: Results of the associations between meat consumption and health outcomes Ref Year Type Food type Results Grade Cardiovascular disease (11) 2019 SR/MA: Cohort studies that included over 1000 adults Processed and unprocessed meat Low-certainty evidence was found that a reduction in unprocessed red meat intake of 3 servings per week is associated with a very small reduction in risk for CVD mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction.

DOI: 10.1093/ajcn/nqaa115. 81 2.8 Milk and dairy products Author: Nicole Bender Reviewer: Suzanne Suggs 2.8.1 Introduction Milk and dairy products are rich in many nutrients like protein, vitamins A and B 12, calcium, potassium, magnesium, and zinc. Fermented milk products contain probiotic microorganisms that interact with the gut microbiome (1). However, the association between milk and dai ry products with different health outcomes is not uniform. Depending on the type of dairy, as well as on the type of outcome, the association was found to be positive, neutral, or negative in the previous expert report of the Federal Committee for Nutritio n in 2019 (2). Overall, the report found no evidence for a detrimental effect of milk and dairy products on health, with exception of a positive association between dairy products and risk of prostate cancer. Several associations between specific dairy typ es and specific outcomes were neutral or even protective, but the evidence was often weak. Since this report, several studies on the association between dairy products and health outcomes were published, including randomized controlled trials, systematic r eviews, and meta -analyses. Here we updated the report focusing on the outcomes cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (myocardial infarction, stroke, and CVD specific mortality), diabetes type II, all types of cancer, and obesity (incl. weigh loss). We did not incl ude all -cause mortality, but the disease outcomes described and the disease specific mortalities correlate with all -cause mortality as well. We included the dairies milk, cheese, yoghurt, curd, kefir, and cottage cheese. We differentiated between different dairy fat levels if possible. 2.8.2 Search strategy We composed a search strategy for the databases PubMed and EMBASE, including terms on the intervention (\"milk\", \"cheese\" etc.), the outcomes (\"cancer\", \"cardiovascular system\", \"diabetes\", etc.) f ormulated as MeSH terms and as free text. We applied filters for human subjects, adult population, English language, publication years 2018 -2021, and study design (review, systematic review, meta -analysis, RCT). The syntax is provided in the annex . Search date was the 10. August 2021. The retrieved references were downloaded in the reference software Endnote, deduplicated and imported in the online review software Rayyan for title and abstract screening. The screening was performed by two independent review ers. We retrieved 33 full -text articles for full -text screening, and finally included 30 studies in the review. Several articles provided information on more than one outcome. 2.8.3 Main findings 2.8.3.1 Cardiovascular diseases The three systematic reviews and four narrative reviews reported mostly on unclear to conflicting associations between different dairies and CVD outcomes. However, a protective effect seems to exist especially for stroke and cerebrovascular mortality (3 -6), and a protective effect seems to com e from yoghurt (3, 6, 7). 2.8.3.2 Cancer The seven systematic reviews and meta -analyses, and the four narrative reviews showed a diverse pattern of results depending on the type of cancer. There seems to be some evidence for a protective effect, especially of low -fat dairies and yoghurt, on colorectal cancer (8 -12), bladder cancer (13), breast cancer (14), and oropharyngeal cancer (15). There seems to be further evidence for the detrimental association with prostate cancer (12, 16) and endometrial cancer (12). One review reported about two cohort studies showing an association between a higher total dairy intake with a statistically significant higher risk of hepato -cell carcinoma (HCC) , while yoghurt consumption was associated with a lower risk. However, other coho rts did not confirm these associations (17). 82 2.8.3.3 Diabetes The three meta -analyses, three randomized controlled trials, and two narrative reviews reported mainly unclear results on the association between dairy intake and diabetes, especially the rather short lasting RCTs. In the cohort studies summarized in the m eta-analyses and the reviews, however, it seemed that dairy in general (18, 19) and especially yoghurt had a protective effect on diabetes (3, 6, 20). An RCT in an Indian population, however, showed positive associations between dairy intake and blood gluc ose values in diabetic and normoglyc aemic individuals (21). 2.8.3.4 Obesity The two meta -analyses, eight RCTs and two narrative reviews show little evidence for a weight lowering effect of milk or dairy products overall. However, if included in calorie -restricted diets, dairies seem to additionally contribute to weight loss (3, 22 -27). Interestingly, there seems to be no difference between low and high -fat dairies in this effect. 2.8.4 Conclusion The evidence for the associations between milk and dairy intake and health outcomes vary by type of dairy and type of outcome. Most results are still conflicting or unclear, probably due to heterogeneity of study designs and populations assessed, as well as to confounding. However, a picture emerges showing that milk and dairies might have beneficial effects on cerebrovascular health, diabetes type II, body weight, several cancers, and especially colorectal cancer. The potentially detrimental effect already observed in the 2019 report for prostate cancer seems to be further confir med, and other cancers such as endometrial cancer should be assessed for potentially negative associations with dairy consumption. From the present studies it was also clear that the results differed by type of dairy, and the role of fermented products des erve more attention, especially yoghurt. In future studies it is important to discern which dairies were consumed, at which quantities, and at which fat level. However, at the moment, there is no scientific evidence for dairy recommendations by fat -level. The former recommendation to diversity the intake of dairy products can still be maintained, with a restriction for sweetened dairies, as there is no advantage over unsweetened versions known to date.

IC (12) 2020 NR Dairy In a large cohort of women, full -fat and low -fat dairy products had similar associations to CHD risk; lower risk than that of red meat but higher risk than that of fish or nuts. A similar risk of stroke was seen between the sexes. No clear association betw een total dairy consumption and risk of CVD. In prospective cohort studies, no clear association between whole milk or low -fat milk with the incidence or mortality of CHD or stroke. IIB (3) 2020 NR Dairy The consumption of milk and yoghurt was associated with a reduced risk of stroke: total dairy 0.98 total dairy (>2 servings/d vs. none) was associated with a lower p=0.0003). Higher consumption of milk and yoghurt, but not cheese, was associated with a lower risk of major CVD events or mortality. IA (6) 2020 NR Dairy Dairy foods may have protective effects on stroke, findings that were not confirmed by all meta - analyses. Yoghurt without sugar may have a beneficial effect. The EPIC Cohort with more than 400,000 participants led to unclear conclusions. After more than 12 years and over 7,000 myocardial infarctions, there was only a modest inverse association with cheese and yoghurt. This association disappeared when controlling for confounde rs. IIB Cancer (8) 2019 SR / MA Dairy A total of 15 cohort studies and 14 case -control studies with more than 22.000 cases were analysed.

The cohorts also showed a significant protective association between low -fat milk consumption and CRC (RR: 0.76; 95% 95% CI: 0.61 -0.87). Cheese consumption (RR: -0.91). No significant associations with CRC were found for the consumption of low -fat dairy products, whole milk, fermented dairy products, or cultured milk. Most of these associations were not supported by the case -control studies. (13) 2019 SR / MA Dairy Medium quantities of milk and dairy consumptions were associated with a lower risk of bladder cancer for total dairy products -0.96), compared with low consumption. Hi gh compared with low consumption was significantly associated with a lower risk for milk (RR: 0.89; -0.94). However, high whole milk consumption compared with low consumption was signif icantly associated with a higher bladder cancer risk (RR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04 -1.38). IIA (9) 2020 MA Dairy Meta -analysis of 31 prospective cohort studies, which included 24.964 cases for colorectal cancer and 2.302 cases of mortality. The pooled RR of colorectal cancer incidence for the highest versus lowest categories of total dairy consumption was 0.79 (95% C I: 0.74 -0.85). For milk consumption, there was also a significant inverse association (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.76 -0.86). For cheese and fermented milk consumption, overall no association was found, but studies from Europe showed a significant inverse associati on for cheese (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 -0.98). For colorectal cancer mortality, a 29% lower risk of death from colorectal cancer in subjects with high dairy consumption compared with those with low intakes was found (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54 -0.93), but no association was found for each type of dairy . IA (16) 2019 SR Dairy Two meta -analyses, 14 prospective cohorts, and 8 case -control studies assessed the association of total dairy intake and prostate cancer (PC) risk. Most prospective cohort studies demonstrated an association with either no change in risk or an increased ri sk of PC. These results were confirmed when only the larger cohort studies were considered. In addition, 3 meta -analyses showed an association between the intake of dairy products and an increased PC risk. IIIA (28) 2018 SR Dairy No strong evidence was found that high levels of dairy consumption are associated with an increased risk of testicular cancer (TC). There is conflicting evidence of a dose -response relationship for the development of TC and inconsistent evidence on whether certain types of dairy are stronger associated with TC risk than others. There is conflicting evidence that an exposure during certain life -course periods affects TC risk more than other periods of life. IIC (14) 2021 MA Dairy Dairy consumption was not associated with a higher risk of breast cancer (BC). Higher yoghurt (HR 0.85; were IA 86 Ref.

Four studies on the effect o f milk consumption on oral cancer risk found no significant association (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.61 -1.37). Six studies about milk consumption and oropharyngeal cancer risk found a negat A meta -analysis concluded that dairy may be protective against colorectal cancer. There is strong evidence that a diet poor in dairy increases the risk for colorectal cancer (1.2x increased risk). IA (11) 2020 NR Dairy In one of the most representative studies, a high -fat content in the consumption of dairy products was observed in 60,708 women, aged between 40 and 76 years, with about 14 years of follow -up. It was found that women who consumed 4 or more portions of dair y products, including whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, sour cream, and butter, showed half of the risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with women who consumed less than a portion a day of these products. IC (12) 2020 NR Dairy The consumption of dairy products was strongly associated with prostate cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers. In prospective cohort studies, milk consumption was most consistently associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, especially with ag gressive or deadly forms. No associations were found with increased risks of breast cancer. Total dairy intake was associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, especially in post -menopausal women without hormone replacement therapy. Consumption of dairy products was believed to increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but no association was shown in pooled analyses. Milk consumption was inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer in meta -analyses and pooled analyses of primary data. IIA (17) 2020 NR Dairy Two cohort studies showed an association between higher total dairy intakes (three servings per day or more) with a statistically significant higher risk of hepato -cell carcinoma (HCC), while yoghurt consumption was associated with a lower HCC risk. Other cohorts did not confirm these results. IIB Diabetes (20) 2019 MA Dairy, fermented dairy Decreasing dairy intake by one or more servings per day over four years was associated with 11% (95% CI: 3 -19%) higher risk of diabetes compared with no change in consumption in the subsequent four years. Increasing yoghurt consumption by half a serving pe r day was associated with 11% (95% CI: 4 -18%) lower diabetes risk. Increasing cheese consumption by half a serving per day was associated with 9% (95% CI: 2 -16%) higher risk compared with no change. Substituting cheese with one serving per day of reduced -fat milk or yoghurt was associated with 16% -22%) or lower diabetes risk, respectively. IIA (19) 2019 MA Dairy Data from 16 prospective cohort studies and a total of 545,677 participants were analysed. Pooled results showed an inverse association between dairy consumption and the risk of diabetes (RR: IA 87 Ref. Year Type Food type Results Grade 0.897; 95% CI: 0.834 -0.963; p<0.01). Subgroup analysis showed that the association between dairy intake and diabetes is significant in women (RR: 0.868; 95% CI: 0.82 -0.92; p<0.001) but (18) 2020 MA Dairy The meta -analysis showed a negative association between total dairy intake and risk of diabetes (RR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89 -1.00).

Curd did not induce any change in glycaemic parameters during the study. IIB (29) 2020 RCT Dairy In patients with type 2 diabetes, increased dairy consumption over 24 weeks to three or more servings per day, compared with less increase, irrespective of its fat content and while maintaining total energy intake, has no effect on HbA 1c. IIB (6) 2020 NR Dairy, fermented dairy Dairy foods may have protective effects on type 2 diabetes risk. However, these findings were not confirmed by all meta -analyses. Yoghurt without sugar may have a beneficial effect on the risk of type 2 diabetes . A meta -analysis concluded t hat the protective effect in diabetes patients derives from low -fat products, especially from yoghurt. The men's Health Professionals Study and the Women's Nurses Study showed that dairy foods reduced the risk of diabetes when they replaced carbohydrates, but not when they replaced whole grain products. Overall, the risk of diabetes was smaller for dairies compared to other animal foods. A recent systematic review and meta -analysis showed that yoghurt reduced the risk of diabetes by 27%. Yoghurt and cheese, which were associated the strongest with reduced type 2 diabetes, may reflect protective processes of fermentation that have not been fully elucidated yet. Milk, cheese and yoghurt should be separately classified from butter. IA (12) 2020 NR Dairy, milk The intake of dairies was associated with a modestly lower risk of diabetes in some cohort studies. However, in large meta -analyses, dairy consumption was not or only weakly associated with a lower risk. In a substitution trial, the risk of dia betes was lower with milk consumption than with sugar - sweetened beverages or fruit juices, but higher than with coffee. Moreover, total dairy intake has not been clearly related to diabetes risk. IIA (3) 2020 NR Milk / yoghurt The consumption of milk and yoghurt was associated with a substantially reduced risk of diabetes. The reduced diabetes risk associated with yoghurt consumption was also highlighted in a recent review. A dose -response meta -analysis of 11 cohorts showed a negative association with diabetes. IA Obesity / weight loss (30) 2018 RCT High vs. low dairy intake Participants in both groups (high dairy (HD) and low dairy (LD) groups) significantly lost weight from baseline to week 24, with no difference between them (p=0.73). Both groups significantly reduced hip circumference (HC) and waist circumference (WC), wit h a larger decrease in HC (p=0.003) and a tendency for a larger decrease in WC (p=0.074) in the LD group. IIB 88 Ref. Year Type Food type Results Grade (22) 2021 RCT Kefir vs. curd Neither kefir nor curd intake over a period of 12 weeks induced alterations in any anthropometric parameters (BMI, lean mass, fat mass and waist circumference) in the study participants. IIB (3) 2020 NR Dairy A large amount of data from observational, cross -sectional, and prospective studies showed a negative association between dairy intake and body weight and central obesity. A review of observational and interventional studies found that high -fat dairy consu mption was inversely associated with obesity in most studies. A meta -analysis of 29 RCTs showed that the inclusion of dairy foods in weight maintenance diets was not associated with weight loss or weight gain. However, an additional weight loss effect was shown if dairy foods were combined with energy - restricted diets. IA (23) 2019 RCT Low-fat dairy vs. placebo Increasing low -fat dairy foods to 4 -5 servings per day during a moderate weight loss diet resulted in the strongest decrease in total body fat and the lowest decrease in lean mass compared to control groups, i n postmenopausal obese women around the age of 55. IB (24) 2021 RCT Milk vs. pistachio In a randomized cross -over trial on milk vs pistachio intake, sixty overweight and obese women with a mean age of 24.42 \u00b1 4.2 years participated. Each Intervention lasted two periods of one month each. Body fat percentage in women in the milk group significantly decreased compared to the control gro up (p=0.001). IB (25) 2020 Overview of 6 SR + 47 MA Dairy In adults, increasing total dairy intake without energy restriction does not seem to affect body composition. However, in the context of an energy -restricted diet increased dairy intake can lead to lower fat mass and body weight. No conclusive effects on waist circumference or lean mass. IIA (29) 2020 RCT Low-fat vs. no-fat dairy In patients with type 2 diabetes, increased dairy consumption to three or more servings per day for 24 weeks and while maintaining energy intake, compared with less dairy intake per day and irrespective of its fat content, has no effect on body weight and body composition. IIB (31) 2021 RCT Dairy (low - fat, full -fat, limited dairy) In this ad libitum study, body weight changed differentially (p=0.006 overall), increasing -fat dairy (+1.0 kg; 95% CI: 0.2 -1.8) (0.4 kg; 95% CI: 1.1 -1.9) wa s not significantly different from the other two interventions. An overall intervention effect was seen for waist circumference (overall time \u00d7 intervention interaction p=0.015), with a significant increase in waist circumference in both dairy groups compa red with the limited dairy group. IIB (26) 2019 SR / MA of RCTs Dairy Meta -analysis of 30 RCTs: For waist circumference (1,348 individuals), the mean difference was 1.09 cm (95% CI: 1.68 to 0.58; p<0.00001). For body weight (2,362 individuals), the dairy intake intervention group lost 0.42 kg more than the control group (p <0.00001). IA (12) 2020 NR Dairy Overall, the results of prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials do not show a clear impact of milk consumption on body weight. There is no evidence to support the advice to choose fat-reduced dairy and low -fat milk does not seem to have advantages over whole milk for weight reduction. Regular consumption of yoghurt may lead to less weight gain. However, this association needs further investigation in randomized controlled trials to exclude confounding. IIA 89 Ref.

DOI: 10.1093/ajcn/nqaa301. Beatrice Baumer Introduction Legumes are defined in the Swiss Ordinance [817.022.109]. This group belongs to the Fabaceae family and encompasses beans, lentils, peas, chickpeas, soybeans, and peanuts, but also alfalfa, clover, and lupin beans. The term \"pulses\" refers to crops harvested for the dry seed, whereas the unripe seeds and pods, e.g., green peas and green beans , are considered vegetables. Legumes are rich in protein, dietary fibre, and carbohydrates (\"resistant starch\" and oligosaccharides), and they are also important sources of ce rtain minerals (e.g., iron, zinc, and potassium) and vitamins, namely B-vitamins such as folate (1). Legumes are abundant in the essential amino acids lysine and threonine, which are typically low in other plant -based protein sources, but low in other amino acids, including methionine, tryptophan, and cysteine (with the exception of soy and soy products; see (2, 3). Because of the latter, legumes are of ten considered to be of lower protein quality. However, if consumed in conjunction with complementary plant -based and/or animal protein sources that contain the limiting essential amino acids they form a diet containing a high -quality protein mixture. Soy and soy products are traditionally consumed in many Asian countries but are increasingly used and consumed in Western societies. Often, soy products in Western societies are consumed not only because of their protein content, but also as a replacement for milk and dairy in vegan/vegetarian/ flexitarian diets , as well as alternatives for individuals with milk allergies or lactose intolerance. 2.9.2 Search strategy A systematic search was conducted to find publications . The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.9. If no relevant literature was found by the systematic search, a \"free\" search in PubMed was conducted. This \"free\" search provided the umbrella review by Li et al. on soy consumption and health outcomes (4) , which was not found by the systemat ic search. The review of the results on soy consumption are based on this umbrella review. More recent systematic reviews and meta -analyses or those that were not included in the umbrella review were used additionally. Also, an umbrella review by Papadimit riou et al. on diet and cancer risk (5) was not found by the systematic search. This umbrella review, however, was based on the results of the Third Report, the World Cancer Research Fund / American Association for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) that conducts rigorous and exhaustive systematic review of the association between diet and cancer risk (6). Therefore, the UR was not considered in this evaluation. Thirdly, the UR and SR/MA by Viguiliouk et al. (7) was not picked up by the search strategy. Products made from legumes such as pea protein, are not considered in this review as this is a rather recent development on the food market and studies on their health effects have not been conducted (or published) yet. 2.9.3 Main findings An umbrella review published in 2019 reviewed the association of the consumption of soy and soy products and a number of health outcomes. As shown in Table 2 7 the studies included in the single meta -analyses were case -control and cohort studies, but no RCT were available (besides body w eight). For most health outcomes, inverse associations between soy/soy product consumption and diseases were observed, the evidence of these studies was graded as very low, low, or moderate. Evidence was considered as moderate for gastric cancer (soy; non -fermented soy products; miso soup) and body weight. The evidence for T2D was different in the three meta -analyses (see Tables 27 and 2 8) depending on the number and type of studies included. Less evidence is available for the consumption of other pulses . An umbrella review conducted in 2019 concluded that high consumption of dietary pulses with or without other legumes (i.e., \"legumes\" without differentiating the legume type or including other types of legumes in the exposure in addition to pulses [e.g., soybeans, soy products, peanuts, fresh peas, and/or fresh beans]) is associated with reduced 94 CVD incidence and reduced CHD, hypertension, and obesity incidence (7) . Two studies were found that have been published after this UR ( Table 29). Both examined th e association with T2D and provided mixed results, such that the consumption of legumes or pulses with not associated with the risk of T2D or with an increased risk. WCRF/AICR examined the effects of the consumption of pulses on cancer risk and concluded t hat data were either of too low quality or too inconsistent, or the number of studies too few, to allow conclusion to be reached (6). 2.9.4 Conclusion 2.9.4.1 Conclusion of the previous report The 2019 FCN report (reference) concluded that legumes should be given more w eight in the pyramid. The positioning of legumes in starchy foods was seen as very questionable also due to their main ingredients. It was recommended that p ulses (ripe dry seed) should be a component of protein -rich foods in the Swiss food pyramid, instea d of only tofu . Furthermore, pulses and then possible pulse - derived products such as tofu, tempeh, etc. should be listed . Unripe legumes such as green peas and green beans should be clearly listed in the food group \"fruit and vegetables\". 2.9.4.2 Conclusion of the current report Higher consumption of soy was associated with a decreased risk of some types of CVD, some types of cancer, and T2D, but there does not appear to be an association with body weight. The level of evidence is considered very l ow to low, given that fact the not RCTs are available (except for body weight). The higher consumption of other legumes (pulses) was inversely associated with some CVD outcomes and obesity, but there were not associations with cancer types (but studies are rare). The most recent SR/MA indicated a possible positive association between total legume consumption and T2D, but heterogeneity between studies is high. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, it was difficult to determine a minimal, optimal, or maxi mal consumption of soy products with respect to CVD and cancer. The conclusions of the 2019 FCN report can be maintained.

DOI: 10.1093/jn/nxaa447. Reviewer: Beatrice Baumer 2.10.1 Introduction There is a growing demand for dietary protein worldwide (1). Protein from meat, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs have good amino acid composition and high digestibility, wherea s plant protein (i.e., protein from non-animal sources) in general has a lower concentration of some essential amino acids. However, the combination of different food groups increases the protein quality. For example, the combination of cereal products wit h legumes, milk with potatoes, or egg with cereal products leads to a good protein quality. Beyond the nutritional aspects of proteins, the role of high -quality dietary protein needs to be investigated also in a broader context, in particular environmental concerns and increasing protein demand (2). 2.10.2 Search strategy A systematic search was conducted to find publications . The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.10. If no relevant literature was found by the systematic search, a \"free\" search in PubMed was conducte d. No SRs/MAs on plant protein consumption (or related terms) and body weight were found, but a free search provided results of a cross -sectional study and a SR of RCTs. 2.10.3 Main findings Since the publication of the EEK report, several stud ies and systematic reviews have been published on consumption of plant proteins and CVD risk and mortality, cancer mortality, and risk of T2D. Although some studies observed statistically significant inverse associations between consumption of plant protei ns and some diseases outcomes (see Table 3 2), most of studies did not find any statistically significant associations. Although generally inverse, the associations with CVD mortality tend to be rather weak. An SR of RCTs did not provide evidence of a prosp ective effect when compared with an animal protein (3). 2.10.4 Conclusion 2.10.4.1 Conclusion of the previous report Plant proteins have been examined in the previous report (4), but no firm conclusions were drawn due to the lack of data, as indicated: \"Plant -protein based products, in particular some ready -to-cook meat analogues, which are sometimes rich in salt and saturated fatty acids, are highly processed [...]; this type of products has not yet been sufficiently investigated, currently there is no evidence which su pports their recommendation. Furthermore, \"quorn\", which is a trade name for a specific commercial product, should not be mentioned in the recommendations, especially as there are no specific studies on this subject and many similar products are currently being sold.\" (4). 2.10.4.2 Conclusion of the current report There is no consistent evidence that higher consumption of plant proteins is significantly associated with a decreased risk of CVD, cancer, T2D or obesity. For CVD, associations with CVD mortality were generally inverse, but there was no statistically significant inverse association with incident CVD.

Role of diet in type 2 diabetes incidence : Umbrella review of meta -analyses of prospective observational studies. Bender Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO ) requested an update on high fat foods. We agreed within the consortium and in consultation with the FSVO that the review of high fat foods should be focused on the topic of ultra -processed foods, an emer ging food group with substantial research activity in recent years and high importance for the Swiss population. The concept of UPF was first propos ed by a Brazilian team of Professor Carlos Monteiro (1). Monteiro defines the following: 'The term \"ultra -processed\" was coined to refer to industrial formulations manufactured from substances derived from foods or synthesized from other organic sources. They typically contain little or no whole foods, are ready -to-consume or heat up, and are fatty, salty or sugary and depleted in dietary fibre, protein, various micronutrients and other bioactive compounds. Examples include: sweet, fatty or salty packaged snack products, ice cream, sugar -sweetened beverages, chocolates, and confectionery, Frenc h fries, burgers and hot dogs, and poultry and fish nuggets.'... (2). To classify foods, the NOVA system was developed that bases classification on the nature, extent, and purpose of food processing. It contains currently four groups: 1) unprocessed or minim ally processed foods; 2) processed culinary ingredients; 3) processed foods and 4) ultra -processed foods (2). With this approach, the NOVA system differs fundamentally from previous food classifications that always considered the nutritional value i.e., the content of nutrients to encourage and to limit. In the last years, an increasing number of studies investigated the association between risk factors for NCD and disease endpoints and the consumption of UPF (see Table 38 ). However, the NOVA is not the onl y attempt to classify foods according to processing. The EPIC has also developed definitions of processed foods, with three categories: highly processed foods, moderately processed foods, and non -processed foods but additionally, for each food category separately (e.g. cereals and cereal products) (3). Several additional classifications exist taking processing aspects into account (4). Thus, the definition of UPF is inconsistent in the scientific community nor without critics, particular due to questionable food categorization, the underlying concept and the rejection of reformulation as way to improve the nutritional quality of processed foods (4 -6). While NOVA focusses on categorization according to processing, studies using NOVA do not explore this aspect of technological data but the nutritional data (5). Within the EPIC study it was found that highly processed foods contributed to the intake of 50 -90% of energy and most nutrients in Nordic and central European countries (3). In Switzerland, when classifi ed with NOVA, 26% of energy intake came from UPF (7). The Swiss Food Pyramid does not mention UPF specifically (8). The top level sweet, salty and alcoholic foods or beverages includes UPF but so can the other levels ( e.g., chicken nuggets and fruit yoghur t in the milk, meat and fish category, packaged bread in the cereal category). It has to be noted that UPF can include a wide variety of foods from snacks to mixed main meals and beverages. 2.11.2 Search strategy We searched the databases PubMed and EMBASE to identify publications about NCD (cancer, CVD, T2D and obesity ) and the OR highly processe d food). To identify relevant results, we set the following filters: humans, English, 2015 onwards, reviews, systematic reviews, meta -analysis and RCTs. We were able to identify 31 results for the title and abstract screening, which we imported to systemat ic Review Tool \"Rayyaan\". In the following full -text screening, we excluded 26 studies for meeting the exclusion criteria such as \"wrong scope\", \"wrong outcome\", \"wrong food item\" or \"wrong population\". At the end of this process, we found five eligible st udies, which were used for this review. In addition, we included a Swiss cross -sectional study as relevant for the local context in the analysis. The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.11 . 112 2.11.3 Main findings Three reviews, one review and meta -analysis and a cross -sectional study from Switzerland were included in the review. The most recent and most comprehensive review and meta -analysis on UPF and NCD included forty -three observational studies (9). As this rev iew included also the most relevant data from a narrative review of (10) and went beyond, the narrative review was not included in Table 35 . Studies used mainly the NOVA classification. 2.11.3.1 Cardiovascular disease Both included reviews (9, 10) that investigated the association between UPF intake and cardiovascular diseases based their evaluation on the French NutriNet -Sant\u00e9 study (11). The highest quartile UPF intakes (22% of weight in g/d) compared to the lowest we re associated with a statistically significant increase in the rates of overall cardiovascular, coronary heart, and cerebrovascular disease by 12%, 13% and 11%, respectively. In contrast, in an US -American study, consumption of UPF in the highest quartile was associated with a 31% higher risk of all -cause mortality but not with CVD mortality (12). There are several studies on risk factors for CVD (13) associated with UPF intake: one article (14) evaluated arterial hypertension as the main outcome, and it wa s observed that higher consumption of UPF (3rd tertile of consumption vs. 1st tertile) increased its incidence (HR: 95% CI 1.06 -1.37). 2.11.3.2 Cancer The NutriNet -Sant\u00e9 study concluded that higher consumption of UPF was associated with a 12% increased risk o f total cancer and 11% increased risk of breast cancer but not with prostate cancer (14). One case -control study found that regular UPF consumption was associated with increased breast cancer risk (adjusted OR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.08 -5.12) (15). Another case -control study found no significant associations between higher vs. lower consumption of UPF (33% vs. 18% of -1.17) between UPF consumption and T2D was only investigated in t he NutriNet -Sant\u00e9 study (17). Higher consumption of UPF was associated with a higher risk of T2D (HR for 10% increase in proportion of UPF: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.06 -1.25) (17). 2.11.3.4 Obesity Most studies that investigated the association between consumption of UPF and disease risk addressed the topic of obesity or overweight (9). In adults, 14 studies were included in this review. The meta - analysis demonstrated that consumption of UPF was associated with increased risk of overweight (OR: p<0.0001). Data from the cross -sectional Swiss National Nutrition Survey menuCH found that women in the highest quintile of UPF weight proportion had si gnificantly higher odds of having obesity (OR: 3.01, 95% abdominal obesity (OR: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.43 -5.05), and being in the highest category of the BMI - waist circumference composite outcome (OR: 3.28, 95% CI: 1.59 -6.77). No relevant associ observed in men (7). One RCT investigated BMI changes related to a 2 weeks diet rich in UPF compared to unprocessed foods (18). Participants gained 0.9\u00b10.3 kg (p=0.009) during the UPF diet and lost 0.9\u00b10.3 kg (p=0.007) during the unprocessed di et. 2.11.4 Limitations of the studies It has to be noted that the consumption of UPFs was classified very differently in studies (e.g. in percentage of energy, in percentage of weight) and comparison of high vs. low consumption differed markedly (e.g. lowest vs. highest quartile or quintile, <5 times per week vs. >5 times per week) which makes comparison difficult. Furthermore, some stud ies included quartiles and quintiles with overlapping below and above sample -based cut -off ranges for categories of lowest vs. highest consumption (e.g., 113 36.5% of total calories was categorized as the lowest cut -off in one study, whereas >29% was the highest in another). These discrepancies limit comparability and conclusions about the amount of UPF in the diet that causes detrimental effects on health. Some reviews included studies that used household availability of UPF (10) while other excluded these studies and used only studies indicating consumption data of UPF ( e.g., by FFQ or 24h recall data) (9). Adjustment for confounding factors was partially not reported or differed between the studies e.g., adjustment for total energy intake or physical activit y level were not always done and therefore, made comparison between studies difficult (10, 19). Furthermore, no conclusion can be drawn about effects of different UPF on health depending on the food group, i.e. whether UPF mixed meals or UPF snacks are mor e detrimental to health than UPF in other food groups. Most studies did not differentiate UPF further and used the NOVA classification that is little differentiating. None of the studies linking UPF to health outcomes does investigate effects of the manufa cturing process on its own on health. 2.11.5 Mechanisms Several emerging mechanisms are suggested to explain the effects of UPF on health, in particular in studies where differences in nutrient values are controlled for. Among others, the following mechanisms are discussed: 1) the nutritional quality of foods, 2) effects of processing on the food matrix resulting in altered bioavailability, digestion kinetics and glycaemic, satiety, antioxidant or alkalinizing potential, 3) effects on the gut microbiota e.g. by em ulsifiers (20), 4) additional constituents of UPF such as carcinogenic compounds (e.g. acrylamide) or compounds which impact endocrine signalling and adversely affecting hormonally regulated metabolic processes (bisphenol A) (9, 10). Strong evidence or understanding of causal mechanisms is lacking. 2.11.6 Conclusion There is moderate evidence that the consumption of UPF in high amounts is associated with an increased risk of CVD, increased risk of total and breast cancer and T2D. There is high evidence that the co nsumption of UPF in high amounts is associated with an increased risk of overweight and obesity. There is insufficient evidence to estimate the amount of UPF that results in these effects. However, already 22% of weight in the diet, vs. 11% per day exhibit ed clear negative effects in a big national cohort study; an amount that is also likely to be consumed in Switzerland. Due to suggested detrimental effects on health of some additives used in UPF, consumers should be encouraged to choose products with a short ingredient list and recognizable ingredients, based on the so-called \"kitchen -cupboard\" or clean -label approach. More studies are needed to better understand the specific effects of UPF on health.

One US study (N=11,898) assessed the association between higher vs. lower consumption of UPF (<2.6 times per day vs. 5.2 to <29.8 times per da y) and CVD mortality but reported association (HR: SR / MA UPF In the prospective study higher consumption of UPF vs. lower consumption (men, 23.3% vs. 11.8%, and women, 23.4% vs. 11.8% of weight; gr/day) was associated with a higher risk of overall cancer (HR for 10% increase in proportion of UPF: 1.12; CI: 1.02 -1.22).

The case -control study examining breast cancer risk alone assessed UPF consumption as a dichotomous variable; less than 5 days per week vs. more than 5 days per week (considered as less than regular vs. regular consumption, respectively). Regular consumption was associated with higher odds of breast cancer (OR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.08 -5.12).

Baumer Reviewer: Pedro Ma rques -Vidal 2.12.1 Introduction Whole nuts and seeds are botanically diverse parts of plants; however, as food items, they have common culinary uses and a comparable composition as source of fats, proteins, and dietary fibre in different ratios. According to the Swiss food composition database (1) standard composition per 100 g ranges are: energy 600 -700 kcal, fat 45 -67 g, protein 15 -26 g, and fibre 6 -10 g. This category is often a good source of micronutrients (e.g., magnesium 100 -500 mg, vitamin E 2-34 mg tocopherol equivalents). Due to their high fat content, they are currently grouped together with the oils and fats in the \"oil, fat and nuts\" group in the Swiss food pyramid (2). Specific recommendations are one portion i.e., 20 -30 g/day for uns alted nuts and seeds. Botanically, avocados are berries. Due to their higher fat content (14.2% according to the Swiss Food Composition Database (1) ) they are also grouped together with \"oil, fat and nuts\" . The same goes for olives, per se fruits, albeit w ith a high fat content, which can vary depending on the processing conditions (15 -17%, with the caveat that processing often also involves the addition of salt to amounts of 1.8 -3.2%). There is no recommended portion size for avocado or olives, but it is m entioned that a small handful of olives or avocado can replace a soup spoon of oil. In the previous FCN report (3), it was concluded that the regular intake of unsalted nuts is associated with a decreased incidence of NCD and total mortality, as based on prospective cohort studies. Furthermore, nut supplementation had a short -termed beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors, body weight, glucose homeostasis, and blood markers of inflammation, as recorded by numerous RCTs, already with 10 g servings. Based on these findings, the recommendation was that nuts should not be equated to animal fat sources in the Swiss food pyramid, due to their high fibre, protein, and micronutrient content. It was hence suggested that nut s might possibly be located at other/lower levels of the pyramid than oils and fats. 2.12.2 Search strategy We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for systematic reviews and meta -analyses focusing on nuts and seeds and NCD (CVD, cancer, T2D and obesity), but n ot for intermediate metabolic outcomes, such as blood pressure, changes in blood lipids etc. For PubMed, all studies related to adults (18+ years) published in English in the last five years were considered, using \"nuts\" and \"food groups\" as main search te rms. Documents retrieved for \"food groups\" were then screened for \"nuts\" in the text and retained whenever nuts had been evaluated as a separate food group. The last specific report in the Cochrane library is of 2012 and was already considered for in the F CN report. The studies passing the first screening had their abstract screened and, in case of doubt, the full text was screened. A separate search, with the same filters, was performed for avocado and olives. The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2 .12. 2.12.3 Main findings Most studies included in the retrieved reviews/ meta -analyses did not specify the types of nuts included, but frequently the sub -group of \"tree nuts\" is mentioned (e.g., walnut, Brazil nut, hazelnut, almond); peanuts (sometimes also pean ut butter) are often included, whereas coconuts are not. No reviews or meta -analyses were found for selected seeds, i.e., sesame, linseed (flaxseed), sunflower, hemp, poppy, pumpkin, or chia seeds, although it is generally recognized that seeds can be an interesting source for a variety of bioactives (4). No study was found for olives or avocado with the applied filters; the results of a larger RCT performed in the USA have not yet been published (5). 2.12.3.1 Mortality A regular intake of nuts up to 20 g/day reduce s the mortality risk (6); other studies included in a meta - analysis show a risk decrease with a dose -response relationship, with no upper limits stated (7). 120 2.12.3.2 Cardiovascular disease Although some larger observational studies show a risk reduction in CVD and mortality (PURE) (8), the evidence from meta -analyses is weak but leans towards a reduction of the risk of CVD and mortality (9 - 14). More studies are being performed as RCTs on intermediate metabolic risk factors; however, these were not taken into con sideration. 2.12.3.3 Cancer The ongoing World Cancer Research Fund data do not list any association, positive or negative between nuts and cancer, stating only \"This Recommendation does not imply that all foods high in fat need to be avoided. Some, such as certain oils of plant origin, nuts, and seeds, are important sources of nutrients. Their consumption has not been linked with weight gain and by their nature they tend to be consumed in smaller portions\" (15). Some recent papers find an inverse association between nut intake and cancer mortality (16, 17), others only in the analysis of sub -groups, i.e., for colon cancer (17) A potential issue linking nuts with cancer risk is whenever an aflatoxin contamination has occurred, this is a food safety issue not further discussed here. 2.12.3.4 Diabetes No specific studies were retrieved. 2.12.3.5 Obesity Although rich in fats, nut consumption is not associated with weight gain. Some studies show that regular consumption of nuts is inversely associated with some obesity parameters (18 -21). 2.12.4 Conclusion No data was retr ieved for seeds; this food group needs further investigation, as well as do fruit containing higher amounts of fat (avocado and table olives). The consumption of nuts in typical servings (10 -28 g) is not associated with higher risks for the NCD considered. On the contrary, an inverse association has been observed with mortality, CVD, some obesity parameters, and some cancer types. The level of evidence is low, and some discrepancy in the data exists. In particular some studies show a dose - dependent associat ion, whilst others found no additional benefit with intakes above 10 g/day.

Furthermore, many papers mention the allergenic potential of nuts as a precaution. Finally, it should be stressed that the recommendations apply to unsalted nuts.

The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta - analysis revealed a beneficial role of nut consumption in reducing the incidence of, and mortality fr om, different CVD outcomes. IIB (10) 2017 MA of 18 PCS 3 servings per week (serving =12 g) The random -effects summary RRs for high compared with low nut consumption were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78 -0.84) for all 0.75 (95% CI: 0.71 - 0.79) 0.73 (95% CI: 0.67 -0.80) 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73 -0.91) for deaths) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.80-0.93) for cancer mortality (11 studies with 21,353 deaths). (11) 2018 Review of MA Nut consumption appears to be associated with reduced all -cause mortality by 19 -20% (n=6), CVD incidence (19%; n=3) (CHD) incidence (20-34%; n=2) and mortality (27 -30%; n=2), and stroke incidence (10 -11%; n= 7) and mortality (18%; n=2). (13) 2020 Summary of 3 PCS 0.5 serving/day Per 0.5 serving/day increase in total nut consumption was associated with lower risk of CVD (RR: individuals who remained non -consumers IB 123 Ref. Year Study Food Type Results Grade in a 4 -year interval, those who had higher consumption of total nuts (0.5 servings/day) had a lower risk of in next 4 years. Individuals who decreased nut consumption by 0.50 servings/day had a higher risk of developing CVD (RR: -1.60) when compared with those who maintained their nut consumption. (14) 2021 UR Out of the six meta -analyses focussed on legume and 15 on nut intake, a possible association with decreased risk of colorectal adenoma and coronary heart disease was found for higher legume consumption, and a decreased risk of cardiovascular and cancer mortality, colon cancer, hypertension, and ischaemic stroke for higher nut consumption. The associati on between legume consumption and CVDs, as well as nut consumption and risk of cancer, CVD incidence and all -cause mortality, was deemed as \"limited\" due to heterogeneity between results and/or potential confounding factors. General benefit towards better health can be observed for nut and legume consumption. Further studies are needed to better elucidate potential confounding factors. IIA Cancer (16) 2021 MA of observational studies Tree nuts In total, 43 articles on cancer risk and 9 articles on cancer mortality were included in the current systematic review and meta -analysis. The summary effect size (ES) for risk of cancer, comparing the highest with lowest intakes of total I2=58.1%; p<0.01), indicating a significant inverse association. Such a significant inverse association was also seen for tree nut intake -response analysis, a 5 -g/day increase in total nut intake was ass ociated with 3%, 6%, and 25% lower risks of overall, pancreatic, and colon cancers, respectively. In terms of cancer mortality, we found 13%, 18%, and 8% risk reductions with higher intakes of total nuts, tree nuts, and peanuts, respectively. In addition, a 5-g/day increase in total nut intake was associated with a 4% lower risk of cancer mortality. IB (17) 2020 MA Nut serving 15 g/day We included 38 studies on nut consumption and cancer risk and 9 studies on cancer -specific mortality. Compared with no nut intake, nut intake was associated with a lower cancer risk (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.86 -0.94). Inverse associations were observed with colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer in subgroup analyses. Tree nut consumption was found to reduce cancer risk (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79 -0.99). Dose -response curves suggested that protective benefits against cancer increased with increased nut intake (p=0.005, P - nonlinearity=0.0414). An inverse correlation with cancer -specific mortality (OR: 0. 90; 95% CI: 0.88-0.92) was observed. (22) 2018 MA Six studies with 7,283 CRC cases were included in the high vs. low intake meta -analysis (overall intake range: 0 -22 g/day) No association was observed for the highest vs. lowest nut intake category (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.96; 95% IIB 124 Ref. Year Study Food Type Results Grade CI: 0.76 -1.21). In an additional subgroup analysis, an inverse association for colon, but not for rectal cancer was observed. Type 2 Diabetes (11) 2018 Review of MA No association between nut consumption and the risk of T2D was observed in MA of prospective studies. Obesity (20) 2021 MA of PCS and RCTs Median nut intake at baseline in the highest quantiles of consumers was estimated at 7 g/day ranging from 3 to 28 g/day. Nuts were associated with lower in prospective cohorts. RCTs presented no adverse effect of nuts on body weight evidence). Meta -regression showed that higher nut intake was associated with reductions in body weight and body fat. (19) 2021 SR / Network MA of RCTs A random -effects network meta -analysis was conducted following the PRISMA -NMA statement. A total of 105 RCTs included. The transitivity assumption was met based on baseline characteristics. In the comparisons of nut consumption versus a control diet, there was no significant increase observed in any of the obesity -related measures examined except for hazelnut -enriched diets, which raised WC. Moreover, almond -enriche d diets significantly reduced WC compared to the control diet and to the pistachio -, mixed nuts -, and hazelnut - enriched diets. In subgroup analyses with only RCTs, designed to assess whether nut consumption affected weight loss, almonds were associated wit h reduced BMI and walnuts with reduced %BF. The evidence supports that: (1) tree nut and peanut consumption do not influence obesity , and (2) compared to a control diet, the consumption of almond -enriched diets was associated with a reduced waist circumfer ence. low (18) 2020 SR / MA walnuts A total of 27 articles were included in this meta -analysis, with walnuts dosage ranging from 15 to 108 g/day for 2 weeks to 2 years. Overall, interventions with walnut intake did not alter waist circumference (WC) (WMD: -0.193 cm, BMI (Coef.= -1.24, p=0.041) Type Results Grade WC (Coef.= -5.39, p=0.038) were significantly observed through walnut intake up to 35 g/day. However, the number of studies can be limited as to the individual analysis of the measures through the dose -response fashion. (21) 2019 SR / MA Dose - response, by 28 g increments Summary RRs and 95% CIs were estimated from 3 reports for the highest compared with the lowest intake categories, as well a s for linear and nonlinear relations focusing on each outcome separately: overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity, and weight gain. The quality of evidence was evaluated with use of the NutriGrade tool. In the dose -response MA, inverse associations were foun d for nut (RR for abdominal obesity: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.31 -0.57).

Reviewer: Suzanne Suggs 2.13.1 Introduction Oils and fats are the most caloric foods, providing nine k ilocalories per gram. Fats and oils are made of triglycerides, i.e. a glycerol molecule to which three fatty acids are ligated via ester bounds. Those fatty acids can be categorized into four groups: saturated (SFA), cis-monounsaturated (MUFA), cis - polyunsaturated (PUFA), (TFA). Fats composed mainly of SFA and TFA are solid at room temperature (butter, lard, margarine...), while fats composed mainly of MUFA and PUFA are liquid at room temperature (olive, sunflower or canola oils...). Most solid fats are from animal origin, while most oils are from vegetal origin. The current Swiss dietary recommendations are ambiguous regarding fat intake: the DACH reference values suggest that fat intake should n ot exceed 30% of the TEI (1), while the Swiss federal commission for nutrition recommends a maximum of 40% of the TEI (90 g per day for a TEI of 2000 kcal) (2). The federal commission also recommends that SFA represent <10% and MUFA <20% of the TEI. The Sw iss food pyramid recommends that fats from vegetal sources be consumed preferably to animal fats (3). In this review, we will not consider nuts or seeds, which have been reviewed elsewhere. In the previous report of the FCN, meta -analyses up to 2016 were analysed (4). Total fat and SFA were not associated with CVD morbidity or mortality. Replacement of SFA by PUFA led to a small but potentially important benefit regarding CVD. Seafood -derived n -3 PUFA were associated with a reduction of CHD risk and CHD dea th. The strongest association was between TFA and increased CHD risk. High intake of total fat and of SFA was associated with increased risk of cancer of breast, endometrium and stomach in some but not all studies, but only five studies were available and most focused on female cancers. Total or SFA intake were not clearly associated with increased risk of T2D, while increased consumption of MUFA, olive oil and in some instances of PUFA were associated with reduced T2D risk. Finally, lowering the proportion of fat in the diet resulted in a small but noticeable decrease of body weight. No studies on the effects of specific oils (i.e. canola, palm) or fats (lard, butter) were provided. It should be noted that the previous report of the FCN focused on fatty aci ds, very few studies being presented regarding oils or fatty foods (4); for instance, the neutral effect of butter on CVD and T2D was not detailed (5). Hence, given the lack of studies focusing on fatty foods, it was decided to include this into this paper . 2.13.2 Search strategy We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for all systematic reviews and meta -analyses focusing on oils and fats and NCD (CVD, cancer, T2D and obesity). For PubMed, all studies related to adults (18+ years) published in English in the last five years were considered. For Cochrane, we extended the research period to the last 10 years, as the number of hits in the last 5 years was limited. Titles w ere screened and a first selection was performed. The studies passing the first screening had their abstract screened and, in case of doubt, the full text was screened. The syntax is provided in the annex , chapter 2.13. Studies on specific diets (Mediterra nean, Nordic, other) were excluded as it was not possible to identify the specific effects of the fat components of those diets. Studies focusing on specific populations ( i.e., children, pregnant or lactating women, elderly ...) were also excluded. 2.13.3 Main findi ngs 2.13.3.1 Cardiovascular disease Total fat intake was not associated with CVD or CHD mortality (6). Reducing SFA had no effect on CVD or CHD mortality or non -fatal AMI, but reduced the risk of combined CVD events (7). SFA intake was associated with increased CHD mortality (6) and a decreased risk of stroke (8). MUFA intake was not associated with CVD or CHD mortality but decreased the risk of stroke (6). PUFA intake was not associated with CVD mortality in one study (6), while a protective effect was found in ano ther (9). PUFA 129 was not associated with CHD mortality (6). PUFA intake decreased the risk of stroke (6), while no significant association was found for other CVD events (10). Replacing SFA by PUFA led to a decrease in CVD events (11). TFA intake was associa ted with increased mortality from CVD. Fish or plant -based omega -3 supplementation had no effect on CVD in one study (12). Alpha linolenic acid (an omega -3 fatty acid) intake was associated with lower risk of CVD and CHD (13). No association between omega -6 intake and CVD events was found (14). Palm oil intake increased the risk of AMI (15). An increase of 14 g/day of butter consumption had no effect on CVD (5). 2.13.3.2 Cancer Several meta -analyses conducted before 2018 but not mentioned in the FCN report were foun d (16 -19). Hence, for completion , they were included in the current report. Four meta -analyses focused on cancer mortality (7, 9, 13, 17), three on breast cancer (16, 20, 21), two on prostate cancer (18, 22), and one for bladder (23), skin (24), endometrium (19), testis (25) and pancreas (26). Total fat intake was associated with increased bladder cancer risk (23), but not with skin cancer (24). Increased SFA intake was positively associated with cancer mortality in one study (9) but not in anothe r (7) and had no association with skin cancer (24). MUFA intake exerted a protective effect against basal cell skin carcinoma (24). PUFA intake increased the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (24) and decreased the risk of pancreatic cancer (26). ALA intake increased the risk of cancer mortality (13). TFA intake increased the risk of prostate and colorectal cancer but not for breast or ovarian cancer or non - Hodgkin lymphoma (22). Fish oil intake was not associated with prostate cancer, but results were incons istent, and no summary results of the meta -analysis were provided (18). Vegetable oil intake had no effect on breast cancer (16). Olive oil intake decreased the risk of breast cancer in one study (16) but not in another (21). Butter intake increased the ri sk of endometrial cancer (19) but had no effect on cancer mortality (17) or testicular carcinoma (25). 2.13.3.3 Diabetes SFA intake exerted a protective effect against T2D in one study (27) and had no effect in two others (7, 28). MUFA intake increased the risk of T2D in one study (29). PUFA intake exerted a protective effect against T2D in one study (29) and had no effect in two others (27, 30). TFA intake had no effect T2D incidence in one study (28). Omega -3 fatty acids intake decreased the risk of T2D in one stu dy (31) had no effect in another (30) and increased the risk in another (27). ALA intake showed a borderline significant protective effect in one study (27), while another study could not conclude as the evidence was of very low quality (30). Omega -6 fatty acids intake exerted a protective effect against T2D in one study (29), and had no effect in another (30). Vegetable fat intake was inversely related with incidence of T2D in one study (27). Similarly, olive oil intake reduced the risk of T2D (32). Butter consumption was also associated with a decreased risk of T2D (5). 2.13.3.4 Obesity Two meta -analyses reported that SFA reduction (33) or replacement (7) led to decreases in weight. No effect of PUFA, omega -6 or coconut oil intake on weight parameters was found. 2.13.4 Conclusion The interpretation of the findings is complicated because intervention studies either reduced, supplemented, or replaced some types of fat. Further, some studies focused on a specific type of fat (oil or fatty acid). Studies focusing on olive, palm or coco nut oil were conducted in countries that are major producers of such oils; hence, a possible conflict of interest cannot be excluded. Finally, for a single study, different conclusions could be obtained regarding the type of fat considered ( i.e., SFA or PU FA). 130 Table 39: Summary oils and fatty foods intake and risk of NCD Conclusion Class Level Total fat Total fat is not associated with CVD II A Total fat might increase cancer (bladder) III B Saturated fat SFA might be associated with CVD III A SFA might increase cancer III B SFA might protect against diabetes I B SFA might increase weight III A Monounsaturated fat MUFA might protect against stroke I B MUFA might protect against cancer (skin) I B MUFA might be associated with diabetes III B Polyunsaturated fat PUFA might protect against CVD I A PUFA effect appears cancer -specific II A PUFA might protect against diabetes I B PUFA is not associated with obesity II B Trans fat TFA are associated with CVD III A TFA might increase cancer (prostate, colon) III B TFA are not associated with diabetes II B Omega fats Omega -3 might protect against CVD I A Omega -3 effect on diabetes is unclear II A Omega -6 are not associated with CVD II B Omega -6 might protect against diabetes I B Omega -6 are not associated with obesity II B Animal fat Butter is not associated with CVD II B Butter might increase cancer (endometrium) III B Butter might protect against diabetes I B Vegetable fat Vegetable oil is not associated with cancer II B Vegetable fat might protect against diabetes I B Olive oil might protect against cancer I B Olive oil might protect against diabetes I A Palm oil is associated with CVD III B Coconut oil is not associated with obesity II B 2.13.5 Recommendations The results of studies focusing on a specific type of fat ( i.e., SFA, PUFA) are difficult to apply in practice as people do not consume specific fat ty acid s, except as supplements. All oils and fatty foods are a mixture in varying proportions of SFA, MUFA and PUFA (34). The fatty acid content of butter varies according to the production system (conventional, organic, or grass) (35); the fatty acid content of canola oil varies according to production, genetic and sowing period (36), and the PUFA content of farmed salmon is higher than of wild type, although at the expense of a higher SFA content (37). Varying the sources of fat, with a higher intake of vegetab le-based sources, will ensure an adequate balance of fatty acid intake and contribute to a healthy diet, as already indicated in the previous FCN report (4). Also, to 131 keep an isocaloric diet, increased consumption of caloric -rich fatty foods must be done b y decreasing the intake of other foods. Providing absolute amounts of fatty foods and oils that should be consumed is a hard task, as few studies provided dose -response relationships; further, most associations were non -linear, suggestive of a ceiling effe ct. Finally, the protective effect of one fatty food towards one disease should be balanced against the possible deleterious effects on other diseases. For example, SFA intake might protect against stroke (8) but is associated with increased cancer mortali ty in a linear pattern if intake exceeds 3% of total energy (9). A meta -analysis of prospective cohort studies concluded that a 10 g/day increase in SFA would lead to a 6% decrease in the risk of stroke, the decrease being effective till 24 g/day (8). Stil l, the 95% CI boundaries were large and included unity. A 1 g/day increase in alpha -linolenic acid intake (equivalent to one tablespoon of canola oil/day) was associated with a 5% lower risk of all cause and CVD mortality, but the effect did not increase f urther after 2 g/day (13). Each consumption of 1 g/day TFA was not associated with increased risk of breast cancer (20), but no dose -response curve of the effect was provided; the intake of 14 g/day olive oil also had no effect on breast cancer risk (21). A decrease in breast cancer risk was observed for vegetable oil intake between 0 and 20 g/day, but the 95% CI included unity (16) In a systematic review and dose -response meta -analysis of prospective observationa l studies the effect on T2D of PUFA and TFA daily intakes between 0 and 25 g (SFA and MUFA); 0 and 13 g (PUFA) and 0-3 g (TFA) was assessed (27). SFA intake between 20 and 25 g/day was associated with a decreased risk for T2D, an increased MUFA and PUFA intake was associated with an increased risk, and no effect was found for TFA. The new studies contradict the previous FCN report, where intake of PUFA and PUFA was associated with a decreased T2D risk (4). Still, the boundaries of the 95% CI of the effects of MUFA and PUFA in the new studies included unity. The issue was further complicated as the dose - response profiles for each fatty acid varied considerably, from a U -shape for linoleic and alpha -linoleic acid to an inverted U -shape for eicosapentanoic and docosaexanoic acid; only long -chain omega -3 fatty acid intake appeared to exert a deleterious effect starting at a consumption of 250 mg/day. Finally, vegetable fat intake exerted a protective effect starting at 5 g/day, which reached its maximum at 13 g/day a remained stable till 35 g/day, while an imal fat intake tended to exert a deleterious effect, namely at intakes higher than 25 g/day (27). The current recommendations from the Swiss food pyramid are to consume 20 to 30 g/day of vegetable oil, of which half should be canola, and 10 g/day of butte r or cream (38), which is in line with the findings. The previous FCN recommendation to reduce butter (4) is not confirmed by the current evidence. The data collected do not allow indicating which type of vegetable oil should be preferred; as already state d in the previous FCN report, \"the choice of canola (rapeseed) oil lacks scientific evidence and is of historical origin \" (4), because no other locally available oil would allow an adequate intake of n -3 fats.

Infanger 3.1 Intro duction Dietary patterns and the associated foods not only have an impact on the health of people, but they also have a decisive influence on the health of our planet (1). The environmental impact caused by food have increasingly become the focus of attention in recent years, and it has been recognized that our current global diet is not compatible with living within the planetary carrying capacity (1, 2). Today, five of nine planetary boundaries (3) are transgressed (4, 5). The safe operating space i s exceeded for novel entities, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, land -system change and climate change. Except of novel entities, all those boundaries are directly related to food production - as well as in terms of being influenced by and influen cing food production. The global food system causes about one third of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions worldwide (6; 7). Agriculture is estimated to use 40 % of Earth's ice -free land, account for 70 % of freshwater withdrawals, and contribute 32 % of global terrestrial acidification and 78 % of eutrophication. Expansion of agricultural land is the largest driver of deforestation, accounting for 80% of deforestation worldwide. This exploitation of natural resources and pollution have a direct impact o n biodiversity on land and in water, with food production threatening >70% of birds and mammals that are listed as threatened with extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Further, approximately 34% of the world's marine fish stock s are overfished and 60% are fully exploited (8). The situation in Switzerland is similar. The Swiss limits are crossed for five out of nine planetary boundaries (9), with a worse situation compared to the global one for nitrogen losses and land cover. The provision of food accounts for almost 30 % of the total environmental impact caused by Swiss consumption and is thus the most important area of final consumption, ahead of housing and mobility (10). With a consistent focus on environmental protection and resource conservation, the environmental impact of the Swiss population's diet could be more than halved (19). Therefore, the current Swiss dietary recommendations already contain references to sustainable nutrition . Further recommendations regarding a sus tainable diet are summarized through the FoodPrints 1. Adherence to the current dietary recommendations compared to the actual Swiss consumption would already lead to a 49% reduction of environmental impact (19). The environmental impact generated by indi vidual foodstuffs varies considerably. In general, animal - based foods have a significantly higher environmental impact than plant -based foods. Within the different animal products, ruminant meats (mainly beef) have a much larger impact compared to pig and poultry meats (11). Even within the same food products the environmental impact can vary greatly, depending on environmental conditions and production methods. According to Jungbluth et al. (10) the environmental impact can vary 50 -fold among producers of the same product. The differences in the environmental impact of food products implicate that different diets also have different impact on the environment (12). A change in diet can have a big impact on the resulting environmental impact (13; 14). If the goal of living within the planetary boundaries should be reached, it is inevitable to reduce the environmental impact of food consumption. There are different possibilities to do so: First, production methods can be improved in order to produce the same ki nd and amount of food with less impact. Second, by reducing food losses, the amount of food production needed to meet food demand can be reduced. Reducing the amount of food produced will reduce the associated environmental impact. However, these two measu res will not be sufficient to reduce the environmental impact of food production to a planetary compatible level (1, 2). A third measure is necessary: Changing the way we 1 https://www.sge -ssn.ch/ich -und-du/essen -und-trinken/ausgewogen/foodprints/ 142 eat, i.e., our diet. Switching from a meat -based diet to a vegetarian (no meat) diet, e.g., can reduce the environmental impact of nutrition by 35 % (13). It is therefore important to also consider environmental aspects when developing nutritional recommendations. This chapter shows the environmental impact of different food items in the S wiss food pyramid and thus establishes the basis for modelling a healthy and sustainable diet for the Swiss population. 3.2 Methodology The environmental impact of 44 important food items / food ingredients in the Swiss food pyramid are investigated by life cycle assessment (LCA). The influence of or the impacts on the economic or social dimension (e.g., prices) of sustainability are not c onsidered. The food items investigated are shown in the supplementary information. The following subchapter describes the methodology used and the underlying assumptions. 3.2.1 Life cycle assessment The methodology of life cycle assessment is defined in ISO stan dards 14040/44 and is divided into the four steps (1) goal and scope definition, (2) inventory analysis, (3) impact assessment and (4) interpretation ( Figure 1). Figure 1: The four phases of a LCA (ISO 14040:2006). The definition of the goal and the scope of the study is decisive for the result of a study. The benefits and function of the product under investigation and its life cycle must be defined. Assumptions, limitations, and the boundaries of the investigation are specified. Furthermore, the so -called functional unit (FU) is defined, i.e., the product -specific quantity to which the environmental impact is subsequently related. Examples are 1 kg of bread, 1 kWh of electrical energy, 1 ha of agricultural land, etc. The FU has to enable a fair comparison between the considered products and be representative of the studied system. The life cycle inventory makes quantitative statements about the consumption of raw materials and the emission of pollutants into the environment along the entire life cycle. The compilation of the life cycle inventory is supported by various datab ases such as ecoinvent2, World Food Life Cycle Database3, or the UVEK database developed by the Swiss Administration. The impact assessment assigns the results of the life cycle inventory to different impact categories according to scientifically based c riteria. An impact category summarizes the environmental impact of 2 https://ecoinvent.org/ 3 https://quantis -intl.com/metric s/databases/wfldb -food/ 143 the individual substances on an environmental topic such as global warming, nutrient enrichment or summer smog. The importance of the individual emissions for the respective impact category is determined by means of impact factors. These factors convert all classified flows for an impact into common units for comparison. For example, nitrous oxide contributes 298 times more to climate change than CO 2. In the evaluation, all preceding steps are critically reviewed and the parameters essential for the result are identified. The consistency and completeness of the analysis is checked, and a sensitivity analysis provides information on the uncertainty of the results. The indicators such a s eco -point (UBP) of different alternative products or processes can be compared. Recommendations are derived according to the set targets or an ecological performance is proven (e.g. reduction of greenhouse gas emissions). 3.2.2 System boundaries For the analys is of the different food items, the life cycle stages 'cradle to shop' were considered. This includes agricultural production, food processing, food packaging, transports to the supermarket and the supermarket itself. Not included is home transport, consum ption, and end -of-life of the products. The disposal of the packaging, however, is taken into account. The food items assessed are modelled with mixes of corresponding food products (see supplementary information). The inventories used represent average or typical production of the corresponding food products. No differentiation is made for primary production systems such as organic or other production systems according to specific production standards. Conventional production is used as default and the sit uation for the supply in Switzerland is considered. Import mixes are only used if already available, no new mixes are calculated. For products produced in Switzerland, the impact of Swiss primary production is evaluated. Foreign products are investigated w ith the data easily available (global mix or country specific data without further research on real import mixes). Furthermore, no distinction is made between different types of food processing (e.g. food UHT vs. pasteurized milk). Transports until shop ar e considered. For products produced abroad, generic transport chains for the transport to Switzerland were developed considering the most important countries of origin, typical transport routes and means of transports (ship for sea transports and lorry for road transports). For all products, transports within Switzerland were modelled with 100 km transport distance from border to the distribution centre and 50 km transport from the distribution centre to the shop. It was assumed that the products are transp orted to 30 % by train and 70 % by lorry. Food waste from field to fork (agriculture, processing, and retail) is taken into account according to the life cycle inventories used (processing) and complemented with information from Beretta (15) for losses in agriculture and retail. 3.2.3 Methods & Assumptions for life cycle stages For the modelling of the agricultural production and processing a life cycle inventory (LCI) was assigned to each food product (see supplementary information). All inputs used for the prod uction of the unprocessed food product at farm are allocated to the stage of agricultural production. Any inputs related to the further processing such as drying, or cooking are allocated to the stage of processing. The food packaging of each product is mo delled according to data from the database Agribalyse. The database provides average inputs for the packaging of each food product. The modelling of the transport of the food products to the supermarket relies on data from the Agricultural Report 2021 of t he Federal Office for Agriculture4 and the Swiss -Impex Database of the Federal Office for Customs and Border Security5. To determine the share of domestic production the average self - sufficiency rate of Switzerland of the of the years 2015 -2019 as published in the Agricultural Report 4 https://www.agrarbericht.ch/de 5 https://www.gate.ezv.admin.ch/swissimpex/ 144 2021 were considered. For product groups where no data was available (mostly products not grown in Switzerland) own assumptions were made. To determine the origin of the imported products, all countries which in total imported more than 80 % of the respective good in the years 2017 -2021 or the five biggest importing countries were considered. The share of each origin was then scaled to the share of foreign production of each product. For each origin an average transport distance was calculated, which is assumed to be transported by an average Swiss lorry fleet. For countries oversees, it was assumed that goods are transported by container ship. It is possible that some of the products may be transported by airplane. However due to the lack of information on air transport, it was neglected in this study. The country origins of the products were o nly considered for the modelling of the transport but not for the production and processing due to a lack of country specific data. The stage at the supermarket considers the electricity and water needed for the running of a supermarket as well as the elec tricity needed for the cooling of chilled products. 3.2.4 Reference unit The environmental impact is expressed per weight (100 g food item) and per nutritional value (kcal). 3.2.5 Database As a first choice, the environmental data on the production of the food items is taken from the World Food Life Cycle Database (WFLDB), linked to the background database UVEK DQRv2_2018. If no data is available in WFLDB, additional data from Agribalyse and Ecoinvent v3.8 are used. 3.2.6 Indicators The ecological scarcity method according to (16) is used as impact assessment method. The key metrics of this method are eco -factors, which measure the environmental damage in eco -points (UBP) per unit of quantity. The impact assessment of life cycle inventories is based on the distance -to-target principle. To derive an eco -factor, the current situation is set in relation to the tolerated target quantity, which is defined based on Swiss legislation. The ecological scarci ty method, also called the UBP - method, was first published in 1990. For this assessment, this fourth edition of the eco -factors was used, including eco-factors for the use of marine fish resources. Figure 2 shows the basic scheme of the methodology including the environmental dimensions considered . Figure 2: Basic scheme of the ecological scarcity method (eco -factors Switzerlan d 2021) with the steps life cycle inventory, characterization and weighting (15). 145 As a sensitivity analysis, additional to the method of ecological scarcity, two other environmental indicators are assessed: ReCiPe Endpoint (17) and Global Warming Potential according to IPCC (18). ReCiPe is the successor of the methods Eco -indicator 99 and CML -IA. The purpose at the start of the development was to integrate the 'problem -oriented approach' of ReCi Pe offers a broad set of midpoint impact categories and uses impact mechanisms that have global scope, where possible. Unlike the method of ecological scarcity, it does not take into account Swiss legislation. Global Warming Potential assesses the potentia l impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change. The greenhouse gases considered are CO 2, CH 4, N 2O, chlorinated and fluorinated hydrocarbons, SF6 and NF3. In this study, the radiative forcing over a time horizon of 100 years was considered (18). 3.3 Results The top chart of Figures 3 to 5 as well as Table 43 show the environmental impact in eco -points (UBP) per 100 g of edible portion for the food items assessed by agricultural production, processing, packaging, transport and supermarket. The ad ditional impact methods used are shown in the supplementary material. The food items with the highest environmental impact per weight are coffee, red meat, fish and shellfish, nuts and seeds, chocolate and tea, followed by vegetable oils and poultry. For c offee, it is especially freeze -dried coffee which contributes to this high impact per 100 g. The impa ct of ground coffee is about 50 % lower than the impact of freeze -dried coffee. This is due to the weight losses which occur during freeze drying, meaning t hat nearly twice as many green beans are needed per kilogram of instant coffee as for one kilogram of ground coffee. Additionally, freeze drying is a very energy intensive process. For red meat, nearly 80 % of the impact is caused by beef and veal, 20 % by pork meat. The high impact of beef meat is mainly caused by methane emissions during enteric fermentation, as well as emissions caused by feed production. For pork meat, the main contribution comes from feed production. For shellfish, especially the shrimps cause a high environmental impact per 100 g. This is due to the feed production for the farming of the shrimps. Omega -3 rich fish has an even higher environmental impact compared to shellfish, due to the depletion of n atural fish stocks. Depending on the fish species and stock, the consideration of overfishing can result in very high environmental impacts. Omega -3 poor fish is more frequently farmed leading to a lower impact compared to omega -3 rich fish. For nuts and s eeds, the highest contributions to the environmental impact stem from pesticide application in hazelnut production as well as land use change caused by and direct emissions during cashew growing. Also, for chocolate, land use change caused by cocoa cultiva tion contributes most the high environmental impact. For tea, pesticides emissions are the most important contribution. The food items with the lowest environmental impact per weight are (in ascending order) tap and mineral water, milk alternatives, salad, milk, potatoes and other tubers, soft drinks, and vegetables. For vegetables, the range within this group is quite wide. Especially vegetables partly or fully grown in heated greenhouses such as mushrooms or tomatoes exhibit a high impact. The lowest char t of Figures 3 to 5 shows the share of the different life cycle stages in the environmental impact of the food items assessed. In general, the agricultural stages contribute by far most to the environmental impact per weight. For some food items, such as yoghurt, vegetable a nd animal fats, dried fruits, meat substitutes and bread the processing is also important. This is mostly linked to a high energy consumption during processing. Please note that for wild caught fish, no agricultural impacts were considered. All impacts fro m fishing were attributed to the processing stage, including the impacts of overfishing. 146 Packaging only plays a role for mineral water, which is linked to the low impact of the mineral water itself. Also, the transports are important rather for food items with a low impact through agricultural production and processing, such as milk alternatives, mineral water and salad. For avocado, the transports are im portant as this fruit is to 100 % imported. Also, for fruit juices, which are to a great share imported, the transports play a role. 147 Figure 3: Environmental impact of cereals, starch -containing foods, fruits, and vegetables according to the ecological scarcity method per 100 g of edible food, per kcal of edible food and share of life cycle stages. 0250500750100012501500UBP / 100g Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket 02468101214UBP / kcal Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket 148 Figure 4: Environmental impact of dairy products, meat, fish, eggs, and other pro teins according to the 0200040006000800010000UBP / 100g Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket 0.020.040.060.080.0100.0120.0UBP / kcal Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket 149 ecological scarcity method per 100g of edible food, per kcal of edible food and share of life cycle stages.

Storage in supermarket has in general a minor role, wi th a maximum contribution of 11 % for mineral water (see Table 4 4). The high share of the supermarket in the environmental impact of mineral water is mainly due to the low impact of the production of the mineral water itself. In absolute numbers, the contribution of the supermarket to the total environmental impact of mineral water is in the sa me range as for the other food items stored at ambient temperature. For food items that are kept refrigerated, the supermarket's contribution is generally slightly higher, however, the preceding stages of the life cycle are more important. If you look at t he environmental impact per kcal, the picture changes (see middle chart of Figures 3 to 5 and Table 45 ). The animal -based food items (shellfish, red meat, poultry, fish, and processed meats) now show clearly higher environmental impacts than the other food items. This is linked to the fact that the energy content of these food items is lower compared to the food items which also showed a high impact when expressed per 100 g of food item (nuts and seeds, chocolate). As no -calorie beverages (e.g., water or te a) do not contain any digestible energy, they are not considered when expressing the environmental impact of food items per kcal. Table 46 shows an overview of the environmental impacts of the different food products and a short summary of the most important contributors to their environmental impact. 151 Table 43: Environmental impact in UBP per 100 g of edible food Food items Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket Total Dairy products, meat, fish & plant -based alternatives Milk for drinking 244.92 1.50 29.22 21.71 5.90 441.03 152 Food items Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket Total Bread 390.11 348.80 153 Food items Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket Total Salad 86.51 0.00 44: Share of life cycle stages in total environmental impact according to the method of ecological scarcity per 100g of edible food Food items Agricultural production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket Dairy products, meat, fish & plant -based alternatives Milk for drinking 7% 5% 1% 155 Food items Agricultural Transport Supermarket Salad 76% impact in UBP per kcal of the edible food Food items WP4 (Sustainability) - only edible parts Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket Total Dairy products, meat, fish & plant -based alternatives Milk for drinking items WP4 (Sustainability) - only edible parts Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket Total Crackers 0.749 items WP4 (Sustainability) - only edible parts Agricultural Production Processing Packaging Transport Supermarket Total Soft drinks 6.722 46: Summary of results of impact per 100 g of product . Food items Summary of impact per 100 g Dairy products, meat, fish & plant -based alternatives The impact of dairy and beef & veal meat is rather high. Especially beef exhibits a high environmental impact. It is mainly caused by methane emissions during enteric fermentation, as well as emissions caused by feed production. Milk for drinking The impact of milk is mainly caused by methane emissions during enteric fermentation, as well as emissions caused by feed production. Yoghurt Yoghurt has a particularly high impact in processing if additional ingredients (such as chocolate), which have a high environmental impact, are added during this stage. Fresh cheese Fresh cheese has a higher environmental impact than soft and hard cheese due to the different modelling approach of the underlying databases. For fresh cheese, a higher use of grassland and more nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions are assumed than for so ft and hard cheese. However, this is rather a modelling effect. Related to milk input, it can be assumed that fresh cheese has lower impacts than soft and especially hard cheese. Cheese - soft The impact of soft cheese is lower than the impact of hard c heese as less milk is required for the production. Cheese - hard The impact of hard cheese is higher than the impact of soft cheese as more milk is required for the production. Red meat - beef, veal, pork For red meat, nearly 80 % of the impact is caused by beef and veal, 20 % by pork meat. For pork meat, the main impact comes from feed production. Poultry The main impact of poultry comes from feed production. Processed meats The impact of processed meat is higher for beef and veal meat compared to pork and poultry. As processed meat has a high share of pork, the impact is lower compared to red meat. Higher impacts emerge from higher electricity use for processing. Fish, omega -3 poor The impact of fish varies depending on the production systems. While the main impact of farmed fish stems from the feed production, the main impact of wild caught fish arises from the depletion of biotic resources . The impacts from wild caught fish tend to be higher than those of farmed fish. Shellfish Shell fish, especially the shrimps cause a high environmental impact. This is due to the feed production for the farming of the shrimps. 161 Food items Summary of impact per 100 g Fish, omega -3 rich The impact of fish varies depending on the production systems. While the main impact of farmed fish stems from the feed production, the main impact of wild caught fish arises from the depletion of biotic resources . The impacts from wild caught fish tend to be higher than those of farmed fish. Eggs The impact mainly comes for feed production. Legumes The range within the group varies depending on the type of legume. Lentils have a high environmental impact due to the application of pesticides, for the chickpea production high impacts come from direct emissions from composting and soybeans have a high i mpact from land use change. Meat substitutes, vegan, minimally processed The impact of meat substituted varies depending on the type of product. Tofu has a lower impact than falafel due to the high impacts of chickpeas and olive oil. However, this depends on the type of raw materials used for tofu and falafel. Meat substitutes, vegan, highly processed The majority of impacts stems from pea protein. Pea protein has a high impact from the use of fertilizer and land use change. Milk alternatives Milk alternatives have a very small environmental impact due to the very high water content of the products. Cereals & starchy foods The impact of cereals and starchy foods is rather low. It is mainly caused by fertilization during cultivation and for processed foods by the energy use during processing. Grains The main impacts of grains arise from nitrate fertilization and to a smaller degree from the application of pesticides. Bread The environmental impact of bread is mainly caused by the fertilization of the wheat grains. Around 25% of the impact is caused by the electricity needed for baking. Crackers The environmental impact of crackers is mainly caused by the fertilization of the wheat grains. Around 25% of the impact is caused by the electricity needed for baking. Crackers have a lower environmental impact than bread, which can be explained by the different modelling approach of the underlying databases. Flour The environmental impact of flour is mainly caused by the fertilization of the wheat grains. Rice Rice production leads to direct CO2 and methane emissions due to the flooding of rice fields leading to an anaerobic production atmosphere. Additionally environmental impacts stem from the use of pesticides and irrigation. 162 Food items Summary of impact per 100 g Pasta The environmental impact of pasta containing egg is slightly higher compared to egg -free pasta, however the higher impact of the egg can be partially compensated by the use of wheat flour instead of durum wheat semolina, which has a lower environmental imp act. Potatoes & other tubers The environmental impact is mainly caused by the application of pesticides. Polenta The main environmental impacts stems from the application of pesticides and fertilizer. Oils & fats The impact of oils and fats is rather high per 100 g, but low per kcal. This is due to its high energy content. The impacts are mainly caused by fertilizer and pesticide use during cultivation. For some products, land use change plays also a role. Vegetable fats For margarine, the impacts arise about equally from greenhouse gas emissions (mainly from palm oil) and the use of pesticide and fertilizer (mainly from rapeseed oil). Vegetable oils The environmental impact of vegetable oils arises mainly from the applicatio n of pesticide and fertilizer. The level of the impact depends on the type and amount of pesticide/fertilizer used. For coconut oil the impact is dominated by land use change. Animal fats (butter) For butter, the impact is higher than for other dairy products as more milk is required for the butter product. However, parts of the impact are allocated to the co -products of the butter production. Nuts & seeds For nuts and seeds, the highest contributions to the environmental impact stem from pesticide ap plication in hazelnut production as well as land use change caused by and direct emissions during cashew growing. Olives The application of pesticides with a high environmental impact contributes the most to the impact of olives. Avocados The environment al impact is relatively low and consists of impacts from greenhouse gas emissions, application of fertilizer and land use changes. Cream The impact of cream is small compared to other dairy products even though more milk is required for producing 1 kg of cream as cream is produced in co -production and hence only a small portion of the impact of milk is allocated to the cream production. Fruits, vegetables, beverages The impact of fruits, vegetables and beverages is low per 100 g, but rather high per kc al. This is due to its low energy content. The impacts exhibit a great range and depend on the way of cultivation. Especially cultivation in fossil heated greenhouses leads to high impacts. 163 Food items Summary of impact per 100 g Fruits For fruits, the range within the group varies. Fruits that are fully grown in heated greenhouses such as strawberries and/or fruits that require high pesticide use have higher impacts. Dried Fruits The impact of dried fruits is higher than fresh fruits as more fruits for the production of 100 g are required and heat is required for the drying. Vegetables For vegetables, the range within this group is quite wide. Especially vegetables partly or fully grown in heated greenhouses such as mushrooms or tomatoes exhibit a high impact. Salad The impact of salad is lower compared to other vegetables as no heating is required. Mineral water Mineral water has a higher impact than tap water due to the product ion of CO 2 for sparkling water. The impacts are however very small. Tap water The only impact of tap water stems from the electricity used for water treatment and distribution, which is however very small. Tea For tea, pesticides emissions are the most important contribution. Coffee For coffee, the impact of ground coffee is about 50% lower than the impact of freeze -dried coffee. This is due to nearly 50% weight losses which occur during freeze drying. Additionally, freeze drying is a very energy i ntensive process. Soft drinks The main impacts stems from fruit juices used for the production of soft drinks. Fruit juices (100%) Although more fruits are needed to produce 100 g of juice, the impact is relatively low due to the dilution with water. Chocolate For chocolate, land use change caused by cocoa cultivation contributes most the high environmental impact. The databases used to model the environmental impact are indicated in table 3 of the Annex . 164 3.4 Discussion 3.4.1 Data quality The environmental impact of the food items analysed depends on the compilation of the respective food item and on the scale used (per 100 g vs. per kcal). Coffee has the highest impact per weight because this f ood item was calculated with 50% ground coffee and 50 % instant coffee. If only ground coffee was considered, the impact would be halved. Still, it would be amon gst the items with the highest impact, in the same range as red meat. The weighting of the different food products within one food item was partly based on consumption patterns (see chapter 5). It was also not possible to take into account all food products which belong to a certain food item. N uts and seeds e.g. were model led using hazel nuts, walnuts, cashew and almonds only. Other nuts and especially seeds like sunflower, pumpkin, etc. are not considered. For a better representativeness of the environmental impact of the different food item, consumption patterns would have to be considered for all food items. Consumption patterns however differ from recommendations. As the impact data created in this report will be used to model future recommendations and not current consumption, food items were mainly compiled without taking current consumption into account. The calculations are based on existing, publicly available databases. To find data for all the foods under consideration, two differ ent databases (WFLDB imported to UVEK -database and Agribalyse) had to be combined. The use of different databases could lead to different levels of environmental impact as a result of differences in background data and emissions' modelling on inventory lev el. Although the evaluation of the existing data did not show any irregularities in this effect, the use of a single, comprehensive database would nevertheless be welcomed. However, such a database would first have to be set up for Swiss food production. A fact to consider is that agricultural production is highly variable, so it is a huge effort to compile representative LCI -data. Therefore, in most inventories, a \"typical\" production is represented. Some inventor ies are built on a single case study , which cannot be judged as representative. In the present evaluations, domestic production was used as far as possible for domestic products, and existing country mixes were used for imported products. However, these do not always reflect the actual countries of origin. This is particularly critical with regard to land use changes. These have a major influence on the environmental impact of products from tropical regions ( e.g., chocolate, soy beans or palm oil) - here it would be important to consider the actual countries of origin of the raw materials (cocoa directly used and indirectly via other ingredients such as cocoa butter). Another important issue is the use of pesticides. In the method of e cological scarcity, this can contribute a lot to the total environmental impact. Although the inventories used take pesticide use into account, they contain very generic and partly outdated data. An update of these data would improve the quality of the res ults. Nevertheless, the results presented show a similar picture as other studies related to the environmental impact of food products. Red meat is among the food items with the highest environmental impact; water -based beverages and vegetables exhibit the lowest impacts. 3.4.2 Reference unit As reference units, only 100 g of edible food and the 1 kcal energy content of edible foods are provided. These reference units are easy to grasp and known to the consumer from nutritional information. However, they do not represent all nutritional dimensions of food. Food not only serves for energy intake, but also supplies us with proteins, vitamins, and oth er nutrients. These are not depicted in the two reference units chosen. Meat e.g., which is a main protein source and exhibits a high environmental impact per 100 g and per kcal, might look different when assessing the environmental impacts per amount of p rotein delivered. Also, coffee has a high environmental impact per 100 g. However, coffee is consumed in very small amounts in the form of a cup of coffee. For a consumer, it does not make sense to compare the impact 165 of 100 g of coffee to 100 g of meat, as those amounts are totally different portions when it comes to daily intake. This should be considered when communicating the results. For the purpose of this report however, the two reference units suffice as further calculations and modelling will be con ducted with the herewith provided data. 3.4.3 Factors not considered Not considered were differences in production systems ( e.g., organic production). Especially in the field of pesticide application organic products exhibit a significantly different impact than conventional products. As the main goal of the present study was to compare different food items, and not the share of organic products in different food items, this simplification was considered acceptable. For transports it was assumed that all transpor ts are made by ship or lorry. However, some food products (e.g. beef meet, some vegetables or tropical fruits) might be at least partly transported by air. Air transports significantly augment the environmental impact of a food product. Figure 6 shows the comparison of the environmental impact according to the ecological scarcity method of 1 kg asparagus produced in France and transported by lorry to Switzerland and 1 kg asparagus produced in Peru und flown to Switzerland. Although the impact o f agricultural production is 40 % lower for the asparagus produced in Peru, the impact of transports is 175 times higher, so that the overall environmental impact of the asparagus produced in Peru is four times higher than the one produced in France. Figure 6: Comparison of environmental impact according to the method of ecological scarcity of 1 kg asparagus produced in France and transported by lorry to Switzerland and 1 kg asparagus produced in Peru and flown to Switzerland However , as the impact data in this report will be used to model future recommendations, it is advisable to not mix the impact of the actual food item and eventual air transports. Air transport is not unavoidably linked to a specific food item and its impact shou ld therefore be communicated separately. The results presented above depict the average environmental impacts per food item. However, the environmental impact can vary greatly depending on the season a certain product is consumed. Especially the production of vegetables in a heated greenhouse lea ds to a high environmental impact. Figur e 7 shows the environmental impact of strawberries produced in Switzerland in a heated and an unheated greenhou se. Only the heating of the greenhouse increases the environmental impact by 60 %. This is due to the use of fossil energy carriers for greenhouse heating, which leads to a higher impact on global warming. Also, long storage time in controlled atmospheres c an enhance the environmental impact of a fruit or a vegetable considerably. Since the data are used to model dietary recommendations, it is reasonable to use average data. The influence of seasonality should nevertheless be communicated separately. 166 Figur e 7: Comparison of environmental impact according to the method of ecological scarcity of 1 kg of strawberries produced in Switzerland, once in a fossil fuel heated and once in a n unheated greenhouse. 3.4.4 Sensitivity analysis Figure 8 shows the environmental impacts of the food items assessed according to three different impact assessment methods: method of ecological scarc ity, ReCiPe and global warming potential, in percentage deviation from the mean environmental impact of all products assessed according to the respective method. The profile looks similar for all impact assessment methods: Amongst the food items with the h ighest impact per weight are coffee, red meat, chocolate, nuts and seeds and vegetable oils. Figure 8: Environmental impact of the different food items assessed according to the method of ecological scarcity, ReCiPe and Global W arming Potential, expressed in percentage deviation from the mean according to the respective impact assessment method. Differences can be observed for shellfish , omega -3 poor fish , animal fats (butter) as well as vegetable oils. Shellfish only exhibits high results for the method of ecological scarcity, whereas it lies near the average regarding ReCiPe and global warming potential. This is due to the pesticide input in feed product ion of the farmed shrimps, which is highly rated only in the method of ecological scarcity. Similarly, omega -3 poor fish show high impacts according to the method of ecological scarcity. This is 167 due to the consideration of overfishing in this method. Anima l fats (butter) on the other hand show moderate impacts according to the method of ecological scarcity, but higher impacts for ReCiPe and especially global warming potential. This is due to the greenhouse gas emissions, which are more important for the ReC iPe-results and the only impact considered for global warming potential. For vegetable oils, according to the method of ecological scarcity the omega 9 -rich oils have a higher impact than the omega 3 poor oils, whereas for the other two methods assessed, i t is the other way round. This is mainly due to the different weighting of the pesticides used. In all three methods, the omega 3 rich oils exhibit the lowest impact. 3.4.5 Possibilities and limitations of life cycle assessment methodology The life cycle method ology used in this project allows the comprehensive assessment and quantification of the environmental impact related to food production, including all relevant life cycle stages. However, there is a considerable data need. Food items are underrepresented i n the UVEK -database, so a second, food -specific database had to be used to be able to cover all food products necessary. This of course can lead to problems in data consistency. Even though the newest eco -factors of the method of ecological scarcity were u sed, integrating eco - factors for the exploitation of marine fish resources, there are environmental impacts which are not covered ( e.g., soil compaction, salinization, microplastics, etc.). Additionally, a life cycle assessment is not a full sustainability assessment. It only covers the environmental dimension of sustainability and does not consider social or economic factors. With the reference of the results to weight or energy content the focus is on eco -efficiency. This is an important information, but not sufficient to conclude on the environmental sustainability of agricultural production itself. 3.5 Conclusion The results presented above show the environmental impact of the food items in the Swiss food pyramid. They should be regarded as a first step for integrating environmental information in the Swiss food pyramid, while their representativeness is still to be enhanced. However, together with the health information presented in this report, an assessment of the synergies and trade -offs regarding healthy and sustainable nutrition is possible. Not all aspects regarding the environmental impact of food are integrated in the results above. As average production is considered, no statement about seasonality is possible. Also, the subject of air transports is not addressed. As these aspects are not primarily depending on the type of food item, but rather on consumer's choice, they should be separately assessed and communicated. The Foodprints6 of the Swiss Society for Nutrition could be a valuable complement here. Considering all impact methods analysed, the food items with the highest environmental impact per weight are red meat, coffee and chocolate, nuts and seeds and animal fats. Uncertaint ies exist for shellfish , fish, and plant oils. Per energy content especially red meat, poultry and fish exhibit a high environmental impact. These results confirm that a diet with a high intake of red meat is not in line with reaching a sustainable diet . While poultry leads to the lowest environmental impact of all types of meat, it is still higher than vegan meat alternatives. Also, coffee and chocolate are related to a high environmental impact and should not be consumed in big amounts. These recommendati ons show synergies to the recommendations made from a health perspective. Trade -offs might exist with nuts and seeds - from a health perspective, their intake is recommended, from an environmental perspective that could lead to a higher environmental impac t. This trade -off should be further analysed with more specific consumption patterns and information on the agricultural production of nuts and seeds. The recommendation of fish should also be carefully analysed, as its impact is particularly high per kcal . 6 https://www.sge -ssn.ch/ich -und-du/essen -und-trinken/ausgewogen/foodprints/ 168 However, more detailed analyses, considering possible alternatives to fish, are needed to make reliable statements. 3.5.1 Outlook/Recommendations The use of a single, comprehensive database for Swiss agricultural production would enhance the reliability of the results. Such a database can in principle be publicly available or created on a private basis. A public database would be more transparent bu t would first have to be set up. Examples exist e.g., in the field of building products, where a single, comprehensive database exists7 and companies can add their products with quality -controlled LCAs. There are various background data on agricultural pr oduction in Switzerland. It would be worth considering a way how these data could find entry in LCA -analysis. Pesticide use e.g., is monitored in Switzerland (ZA -AUI PSM8). Including this data in the calculation of environmental impacts would greatly increase the reliability of the results for Swiss products. For some Swiss products, detailed studies on their production are available [ e.g., Wolff et al. 2017 (20); Bystricky et al. 2015 (22)], but the corresponding life cycle inventories are not published. Consistent publication of life cycle inventories financed by the public sector could further improve the data base. 3.6 References 1.

Use oils and nuts in small amounts daily and butter/margarine sparingly. Consume three servings of dairy products and one serving of meat/fish/eggs/tofu per day. Alternate between protein -rich foods. Watch for calcium in plant -based alternatives to dairy. Consume meat in moderation. Replace meat more often with other protein -rich foods e.g., tofu, legumes or eggs. Consume three servings of grains, potatoes, and legumes per day. Grains should preferably be whole grains. Legumes are good sources of protein. Consume five s ervings of fruits and vegetables per day, including at least three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit. One portion can be replaced by (unsweetened) juice. Consume a diversity (different colours) of vegetables and fruits. Large portions. Drink 1-2 litres of unsweetened beverages per day, preferably water. Not food -based At least 30 minutes of physical activity daily and sufficient relaxation. Austria Food -based Non-alcoholic beverages: Drink at least 1.5 litres of liquid daily, preferably low-energy beverages in the form of water, mineral water, unsweetened fruit or herbal teas or diluted fruit and vegetable juices. Vegetables, legumes, and fruit: Eat 5 servings of vegetables, legumes a nd fruits daily. Ideally, 3 servings of vegetables and/or legumes and 2 servings of fruit. Milk and dairy products: Consume 3 servings of milk and dairy products daily. Fish, meat, sausage, and eggs: Eat at least 1 - 2 portions of fish per week (approx. 15 0 g each), eat red meat (such as beef, pork, and lamb) and sausages rather rarely. You can consume up to 3 eggs per week. Fats and oils: Daily 1 - 2 tablespoons of vegetable oils, nuts or seeds. Physical activity: A healthy lifestyle also includes physical exercise - at least 3.5 hours per week. Fatty, sweet, and salty foods: Consume fatty, sugary and salty foods and high-energy drinks infrequently. Germany Food -based Enjoy food diversity: Take advantage of food diversity and eat a varied diet. Choose mostly plant -based foods. Vegetables and fruit - take \"5 a day\". Enjoy at least 3 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruit a day. The colourful selection also includes legumes such as lentils, chickpeas an d beans as well as (unsalted) nuts. Choose whole grains. When it comes to grain products such as bread, pasta, rice and flour, the whole grain variety is the best choice for your health. Complete the choice with animal -based foods. Eat milk and dairy produ cts such as yoghurt and cheese daily, and fish once or twice a week. If you eat meat, then no more than 300 to 600 g per week. Use healthy fats. Give preference to vegetable oils such as canola oil and spreadable fats made from it. Avoid hidden fats. Fat i s often \"invisible\" in processed foods such as sausage, pastries, confectionery, fast food and convenience products. 173 Country / author Overarching messages Cut down on sugar and salt. Foods and beverages sweetened with sugar are not recommended. Avoid them if possible and use sugar sparingly. S ave salt and reduce the amount of high -salt foods. Season creatively with herbs and spices. Water is the best choice. Drink about 1.5 litres every day. Preferably water or other calorie -free beverages such as unsweetened tea. Sugar -sweetened and alcoholic beverages are not recommended. Not Food -based Prepare food gently. Cook food as long as necessary and as short as possible, using little water and little fat. Avoid burning food when frying, grilling, baking and deep -frying. Eat mindfully and enjoy. Give y ourself a break for your meals and take your time eating. Eating slowly and consciously promotes enjoyment and the sense of satiation. 1Watch your weight and stay active. Healthy diet and physical activity go hand in hand. Not only regular exercise is help ful, but also an active daily routine, such as walking or cycling more often. France Food -based Increase: Consumption of fruits and vegetables in any form (raw, cooked, natural, prepared, fresh, frozen or canned) to at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day and a small handful of unsalted nuts per day Consumption of legumes (beans, lentils, chickpea s, etc.) Use the following foods: Organic, seasonal, and locally produced foods Starchy foods (pasta, bread, rice, semolina, potatoes) that can be eaten daily, with preference given to whole starchy foods Fish, twice a week, including one fatty fish (sardi nes, mackerel, herring, salmon) Dairy products (milk, yoghurt , cheese, and cottage cheese), 2 per day for adults. Canola, walnut, and olive oil (the added fats - oil, butter and margarine - can be consumed daily in small amounts) Limit consumption of: Meat, preferring poultry and limiting other meats (pork, beef, veal, mutton, lamb, offal) to 500 g per week Processed meat to 150 g per week Salty products and salt (to 5 g per day for an adult) Sweetened drinks, fatty, sweet, salty and highly processed foods Products with a N utri-score \"D\" or \"E Alcohol, not more than two glasses per day and not every day Not Food -based Increase: Physical activity to achieve at least 30 minutes of fast walking pe r day (climbing stairs, running errands on foot, etc.). meals prepared at home at least twice a week Limit the time spent sitting: take the time to walk a little every 2 hours. Pay attention to the time you spend on the screen. Italy Food -based More is be tter: More fruit and vegetables More whole grains and legumes Drink plenty of water every day Less is better: 174 Country / author Overarching messages Fats: choose which ones and limit the quantity Sugar, sweets and sugary drinks: less is more Salt: less is more Alcoholic beverages: as little as possible Not Food -based Balance nutrients and maintain your weight. Control your weight and stay active Netherlands Food -based Follow a dietary pattern that involves eating more plant -based and less animal - based food, as recommended in the guidelines Eat at least 200 grams of vegetables and at least 200 grams of fruit daily Eat at least 90 grams of brown bread, wholemeal bread or other whole -grain products daily Eat legumes weekly Eat at least 15 grams of unsalted nuts daily Take a few portions of dair y produce daily, including milk or yoghurt Eat one serving of fish weekly, preferably oily fish Drink three cups of tea daily Replace refined cereal products by whole -grain products Replace butter, hard margarines, and cooking fats by soft margarines, liqu id cooking fats, and vegetable oils Replace unfiltered coffee by filtered coffee Limit the consumption of red meat, particularly processed meat Minimise consumption of sugar -containing beverages Don't drink alcohol or no more than one glass daily Limit salt intake to 6 grams daily Nutrient supplements are not needed, except for specific groups for which supplementation applies Sweden Food -based More: Vegetables and fruits Seafood Exercise Switch to Wholegrain Healthy fats Low fat dairy products Less Red and processed meat Salt Sugar Maintain a balance Not Food -based More: Exercise United Kingdom Food -based Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day 175 Country / author Overarching messages Base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates; choosing wholegrain versions where possible Have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks); choos ing lower fat and lower sugar options Eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins (including 2 portions of fish every week, one of which should be oily) Eat more beans and pulses, 2 portions of sustainably sourced fish per week, one of whic h is oily. Eat less red and processed meat Choose unsaturated oils and spreads and eat in small amounts Drink 6 -8 cups/glasses of fluid a day If consuming foods and drinks high in fat, salt or sugar have these less often and in small amounts. Cutting down on saturated fat Cutting down on sugar Cutting down on salt Not Food -based Food labelling: You can tell at a glance if they are high, medium or low in fat, saturated fat, sugars , and salt. For a healthier choice, try to pick products with more greens and ambers and fewer reds. How much food do I need? Try to eat only as much food as you need and get more active! Do I need vitamin and mineral supplements? Most people can get all th e nutrients their body needs by eating healthily. However, some people do need certain supplements. EAT Our food in the anthropocene: h ealthy diets f rom sustainable food s ystems to achieve planetary health diets for nearly 10 billion p eople by 2050 . Setting scientific t argets for healthy diets and sustainable food p roduction Target 1: Healthy d iets. Transformation to healthy diets by 2050 will require substantial dietary shifts. Dietary changes from current diets toward healthy diets are likely to result in significant health benefits. Target 2: Sustainable food p roduction Strategy 1: Seek international and national commitment to shift toward healthy diets Strategy 2: Reorient agr icultural priorities from producing high quantities of food to producing healthy food Strategy 3: Sustainably intensify food production to increase high -quality output Strategy 4: Strong and coordinated governance of land and oceans Strategy 5: At least halve food losses and waste, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals WHO A healthy diet helps protect against malnutrition and diet -related noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. Adopt healthy dietary practices: Balance calories in with calories out Limit fat intake Shift from saturated to unsaturated fats Eliminate industrially -produced trans fats Limit sugars and salt intake 176 4.3 Key similarities and differences The following points synthesize the key similarities and differences among the reviewed guidelines . For a full summary see Table 50. Dietary guidance was disaggregated in 10 food groups to facilitate comparisons. The original food groups of each dietary guidelines can be found in Table 5 1. The reviewed guidelines have very similar recommendations for fruit and vegetables , 5 servings per day; water , 1.5 litres per day; fish, 1 or 2 servings per week, except for Sweden that suggests 2 to 3 servings per week; and nuts & seeds ranging from 15 to 50 g/d ay. The EAT recommended intake is the highest (50 g/d ay; range 0 -75). A key difference in vegetable recommendations arise from t he fact that Sweden includes potatoes in the vegetable group, while Austria, Germany, and the UK include legumes, so they can count for the '5 a day'. Guidance on the starchy food group varies in included foods, units used, amounts recommended and serving sizes but all guidelines favour wholegrains over refined foods. Recommended intake, when provided, ranges from 180 g/d ay in the UK to 485 g/day in Germany ( mean=338.7). Three countries inc lude a suggested number of servings per day: Switzerland (3 servings), Austria (4 servings), and Italy (6 servings). France, Netherlands, Sweden, and the WHO do not suggest specific intake amounts for starchy foods, although guidance for wholegrains is pro vided in the Netherlands (at least 90 g/d ay) and Sweden (80 g/d ay). All the reviewed guidelines include meat as part of a broader protein -rich food group, so it can be exchanged for legumes, eggs or other plant -based proteins. Countries that provide separate guidance on eggs intake suggest up to 3 per week, except for Italy that recommends 2 to 4. Except for the UK, all guidelines suggest to reduce or moderate meat intake , limiting suggested consumption to a certain a mount. However, the units and intake recommendations vary as some guidelines define amounts for the food group; others specify a range or a maximum intake and other only number of servings. The guidelines that clearly define a limit/maximum weekly intake are Austria (450 g), Netherlands (500 g), Germany (600 g) and EAT (602 g). The low end of the range for EAT is 0 g, as meat is not considered essential for a healthy diet. Austrian and Swiss guidelines suggest eating meat up to 3 times per week. However, th e recommendation framing differs as Austrian guidelines suggest up to 3 servings per week as a maximum and Swiss guidelines mention 2 or 3 servings per week are enough . Swiss guidelines do not provide specific suggestions about red meat . All the other guid elines suggest either reducing or limiting red meat intake to a certain weekly amount, that range from maximum 98 g in the EAT guidelines to 500 g in French and Swedish guidelines. Austria, Netherlands and Sweden discourage consumption of processed meat along with red meat. France suggests to \"limit charcuterie\" to 150 g per week while the UK suggests to \"cut down\" processed meat to a maximum 70 g/d ay. Italian guidelines position \"transformed and conserved meats\" in the group of foods for optional consumption (not indispensable for nutritional needs), so if wanted should be limited to \"small quantities\". Most of the reviewed guidelines encourage the consumption of legume/pulses , except for Germany that has a rather neutral framing for legume intake as part of the fruit & vegetable group. Legume recommended intake is usually included in a broader food group and only half of the reviewed guidelines provide separated intake guidance. France suggests at least 2 servings, Netherlands 2 -3 servings and Ital y 3 servings per week. The EAT reference diet is the only one that suggests specific mean daily amounts (50 g of beans, lentils, and peas, and 25 g of soybeans). The position of legumes within food groups also varies among guidelines. E AT Lancet Commission , Italy, Netherlands, the WHO and the UK include legumes within the protein food group; Austria, Germany, Sweden, and the UK (again) include legumes within the vegetable food group, Switzerland locates legumes within the starchy food group, and France has legumes/pulses in a separate food group. 177 Guidelines that include recommended servings of dairy range between 2 or 3 servings per day (milk equivalents as defined by Springmann et al 2020, where 10 units of milk are needed to make 1 unit of hard cheese, 1.5 units of milk are needed to make 1 unit of yoghurt). However, the mean suggested amounts vary from 250 g/d by EAT to 1295 g by the Italian guidelines (mean=693.13). The EAT r eference diet recommends between 0 and 500 g of milk or equivalents per day. The UK and the WHO do not provide specific reference amounts for dairy. Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK provide explicit suggestions for vegan and veg etarians. The EAT guidelines do this implicitly by suggesting healthy diets without consumption of meat or dairy (lower range is 0). Switzerland, Austria, EAT, Germany, and the UK provide visual representations of their reference diets. EAT and the UK explicitly mention the importance of sustainable diets. 4.4 Conclusion The Swiss dietary recommendations for adults are rather consistent with other countries in terms of their scientific basis. And like others, they include fruit and vegetable, water, and fish recommendations, they suggest that meat is an exchangeable part of the diet, and they encourage the consumption of legumes. What is unique in the Swiss recommendations is that legumes are included in the starchy food group, dairy products a re included in the same food group of meat, fish, eggs & tofu instead of a specific category dedicated to dairy. And regarding meat consumption, there is only an implicit recommendation for red meat. All other guidelines explicitly suggest limiting red mea t. Switzerland is also unique in its framing of the recommendations themselves. Most countries stress \"healthy eating\" and \"guideline\" in the titles of their recommendations, but Switzerland positions a healthy diet as an enjoyable diet and provides recomm endation vs rules in the title: \"Recommendations for a healthy and enjoyable adul t diet\". The joy of eating emphasis is to be commended and built upon. This strategy communicates that a healthy diet is not about what one cannot have, but rather one that gi ve many benefits, including joy. 178 Table 49: Dietary guidance per food group in selected guidelines. Country / author Water & Beverages Fruits & Vegetables Cereals, grains, bread, potatoes Legumes Switzerland 1 to 2 litres per day Drink water regularly throughout the day, both during and between meals. Choose unsweetened beverages, such as tap water or mineral water, or fruit or herbal teas. Caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, black or green tea, may also contribute to fluid intake. 5 servings a day, of different colours, including 3 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruit 1 serving is equivalent to 120 g. One serving per day may be replaced by 2 dl of unsweetened vegetable or fruit juice. 3 portions per day Give preference to whole grain products.

Unsweetened tea, coffee (in moderation) and infusions can also serve as water. Fruit juices, sugary drinks and soft drinks, even diet drinks, \"energy\" drinks must be limited - no more than one glass per day. At least 5 per day. Recommended portion sizes are 80 - 100g. Increase your consumption regardless of the initial consumption level. No more than one glass of fruit juice per day, which counts as one portion of fruit and vegetables. Favour fresh pressed fruit juice. To be consumed daily, at least one wholegrain starc h per day, and one portion per meal, opting for wholegrain or unrefined products. At least twice a week as they are naturally rich in fibre. Increase pulses. Pulses may accompany poultry, fish or meat or could also replace meat and poultry; in this case, the recommendation is to serve them with a grain product. If you can, favour organic pulses. Italy On average 1.5 -2 litres of water per day (at least 6 -8 glasses) even between meals. Drink frequently and in small amounts. Drink slowly, especially if the water is very cold. Eat more fruit, vegetables, and tubers 2.5 portions (standard portion is 200g) of fresh vegetables per day AND 3 portions (standard portion 150 g) of fruits per day Consume bread, pasta, rice and other grains (preferably whole grains) regularly Bread (3. 5 portions of 50 g per day); pasta, rice, corn...

Eat lots of fruit, vegetables and berries! Ideally, choose high fibre veggies such as root vegetables, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, beans and onions. Eat at least 500 g of vegetables and fruit every day. This is equivalent to two generous handfuls of vegetables, root vegetables and two pieces of fruit. Potatoes aren't included in those 500 g, but they're a good food anyway. Choose wholegrain varieties when you eat pasta, bread and grain. About 70 g per day for women and 90 g for men. This is equivalent to two pieces of crispbread and a portion of wholegrain pasta, for example. Discover legumes Eat at least 500 g of vegetables and fruit every day, which is equivalent to two generous handfuls of legumes. United Kingdom 6-8 cups/glasses of fluid every day Water, lower fat milk and sugar - free drinks including tea and coffee all count. Limit fruit juice and smoothies to no more than a combined total of 150 ml per day. Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. A portion equals 80 g or any of these: 1 apple, banana, pear, or ange or other similar -size fruit, 3 heaped tablespoons of vegetables, a dessert bowl of salad, 30 g of dried fruit or a 150 ml glass of fruit juice or smoothie Choose higher -fibre, wholegrain varieties Base your meals around starchy carbohydrate foods. Beans, peas and lentils (which are all types of pulses) are good alternatives to meat. Eat more beans and pulses. Pulses can be part of the \"5 a day\" (fruit & vegetables). EAT Not provided 100 to 300 g/day of fruit A planetary health plate should consist of approximately half a plate of vegetables and fruits. Macronutrient intake: Vegetables (300 g/day; range 200 -600) Fruits (200 g/day; range 100-300) A planetary health plate should consist of approximately half a plate of primarily whole grains. Whole grains: rice, wheat, corn and other macronutrient intake range: 232 g/day Global consumption of legumes will have to double, and consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar. Macronutrient inta ke: 75 g/day; range 0 -100 181 Country / author Water & Beverages Fruits & Vegetables Cereals, grains, bread, potatoes Legumes WHO Not provided At least 400 g ( i.e., five portions) of fruit and vegetables per day excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots. 2 cups of fruit (4 servings), 2.5 cups of vegetables (5 servings) A healthy diet includes whole grains ( e.g., unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice). 180 g /d of grains A healthy diet includes legumes (e.g., lentils and beans) 160 g of meat and beans 182 Table 49 (cont.).

Country / author Dairy / milk Oils, fats Nuts & Seeds Switzerland 3 servings of milk/dairy products per day 1 serving equals: Milk (2 dl) Yoghurt (150-200 g) Semi -hard/hard cheese Soft cheese (60g) Curd/cottage cheese (150-200 g) 2-3 tablespoons per day (20 -30 g) of vegetable oil, at least half of which should be in the form of canola oil. Use fats such as butter and margarine, and high-fat milk products sparingly (about 1 tablespoon = 10 g). 1 serving per day (20-30 g) of unsalted nuts (e.g., walnuts) or unsalted seeds. Austria 3 servings of milk and dairy products per day Prefer low -fat varieties 2 portions of \"white\" ( yoghurt ) and 1 portion of \"yellow\" (cheese) 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oils, nuts or seeds per day Quality before quantity. E.g. olive oil, rapeseed oil, but also other vegetable oils such as walnut oil, soybean oil Use fats such as butter and margarine, and high-fat milk products sparingly. 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oils, nuts or seeds per day Nuts and seeds contain valuable fatty acids and can be consumed in moderate quantities. Germany Eat milk and dairy products like yoghurt and cheese daily 200-250 g of milk and dairy products and 2 slices (50 -60 g) of cheese If you want to save calories, choose the low - fat varieties. 10-15 g/d oil (e.g. rapeseed, walnut or soybean oil) 15-30 g margarine or butter Nuts included in Fruit & Vegetable food group. 25 g of nuts can replace one serving of f ruit. France Go towards a sufficient but limited consumption of dairy products. 2 dairy products per day, alternating between milk, yoghurt , cheese and cottage cheese. Butter and cream are not included in dairy products because they are rich in fat. Every day in small quantities. Avoid excessive consumption. Favour rapeseed and nut oils (rich in ALA) and olive oil instead of oils low in ALA (including sunflower and peanut oils). Animal fats are to be used raw and in a limited quantity. In addition to fruit and vegetables, the recommendation is to consume a small handful of unsalted nuts each day. Italy 3 glasses of milk per day [or] 3 yoghurts per day [or] 2 -3 portions of fresh cheese per week [or] 2 -3 portions of aged cheese per week. Drink every day a glass of milk or yoghurt , preferably skimmed. Less is better - Fats: choose which ones and limit quantity. Olive oil/vegetable oil (3 spoons of 10ml per day) Butter, fats from animal/vegetable origin (3 portions of 10g per day).

Depending on what else you eat - cheese, for example - 2-5 decilitres of milk or fermented milk a day is all you need to make sure you get enough calcium. Choose healthy oils when cooking, such as rapeseed oil or liquid fats made from rapeseed oil. Nuts and seed with fabulous fat Cooking fats aren't our only source of \"good\" fat - nuts and seeds are full of healthy fats too. Choose the unsalted varieties, of course. United Kingdom Go for lower fat and lower sugar products where possible. Swap flavoured or corner -style yoghurts for low fat, lower sugar yoghur ts, adding fresh fruit for variety. When buying dairy alternatives, go for unsweetened, calcium -fortified versions. Choose unsaturated oils and spreads and eat in small amounts. All fat should be limited. Reduce your saturated fat intake. Nuts (plain) included in protein food group, but no specific recommendation about quantity or frequency of consumption.

DOI: 10.1136/bmj.m2322 191 5 Definition of foodstuffs important for the Swiss nutritional guidelines Authors: Klazine van der Horst, Undine Lehmann, Martina Alig The definition of foodstuffs of important for the Swiss nutritional guidelines aimed to cover the whole range of foods relevant from a nutritional/health point of view as a priority, and from an environmental point of view as a second step. This food list served as a basis for several work packages to enable connection between the different work packages as well as connecting health and sustainability impact. 5.1 Food list for the association between foods and non -communicable diseases. The food -groups as in Table 51 were defined as the food groups of importance for health ( NCD ) and nutrition recommendations which served as the basis of the literature reviews conducted in chapter 6. It is important to note that for some food groups the level and amount of available evidence limits the further categorization of these foods in sub -groups. This food list was created based on the 2019 FCN report which summarized evidence from 2012 -2017 (1) and additional food s as listed in the specifications of the public tender [fruit juices, vegetable oils, fatty foods (nuts, seeds, avocado, olives ); soy and soy products] . Table 52: List of food groups to be included in the literature review for dietary recommendations Food Group Food sub -groups Milk and dairy Milk and dairy products - focus on low fat vs full fat products Meat, fish, eggs Red meat Poultry Processed meats Fish & fish products, non -fatty Fatty fish - Potentially not enough evidence for the difference between fatty and lean fish Eggs Plant proteins and legumes Legumes (pulses), fresh legumes in vegetables food group Milk & dairy alternatives - Distinguish between enriched (e.g., calcium) and not enriched if possible Soy and soy products (Tofu) Cereals and starchy foods Wholegrains and starchy foods Refined grains and starchy foods Breakfast cereals (sweetened/unsweetened) Oils, fats, nuts Vegetable oils and fats Animal fats (butter) Nuts, seeds, avocado, olives Fruits and vegetables Fruits 192 Food Group Food sub -groups Vegetables, incl. fresh legumes such as green beans, green peas, snow peas Beverages General fluid intake, water Coffee Sugar sweetened beverages Fruit Juices (100%) Packaged foods and snacks ( incl. ultra- processed foods) Ultra -processed foods 5.2 Food list for the association between foods and sustainability To answer the question on environmental impact of various foods and to explore potential conflicts between nutritional and environmental impact of foods, the food list of step 1 was further developed. This list would also serve as a basis fo r the statistical model that will be developed in the future. For the development of this extended list additional food groups were created to reflect all basic 31 food groups used in the Menu CH study (2). Based on the available environmental impact data foods representing these food groups were identified for the Swiss diet. Therefore, the WFLDB and Agribalyse databases were used. The available environmental data, food frequency data from menuCH, together with extensive working group discussions, includin g the BLV as main stakeholder led to the final food list that will serve as a basis of the statistical model. Because a detailed assessment on organic products was not foreseen, organic foods are left out of the Table. After the identification of the foods that would represent a food sub -group the weighting factors for these foods were established. For most categories an equal weigh ting was applied, with all individual food items contributing similar to the environmental impact evaluation of a food category . However, for some foods groups, this would give a distorted picture due to a difference with consumption in the population (e.g., a large environmental impact contribution for foods that are minimally consumed). For these groups, menuCH consumption frequ ency data was used to calculate the weigh ting percentages of the foods which are reflected in the final Table 53 . With these weigh ting factors contribution of individual foods to the environmental impact of food subgroups was established and was used for t he calculation of environmental impact calculation per 100 gram and per kcal of the food subcategories as is further described under the statistical model. Where relevant the edible part of the food was considered using Delane et al (3), instead otherwise indicated in Table 54 . 193 Table 53: List of foodstuffs important for the Swiss nutritional recommendations Food Group # Food subcategories for WP4 Available LCI Data used for calculation of food items (organic excluded) Weigh ting Edible part % Milk & dairy 1 Milk for drinking Milk, semi -skimmed 50% 100% Milk, whole 50% 100% 2 Yoghurt Yoghurt natural (3.6% Fat) 33.4% 100% Yogurt with fruits, with sugar 33.3% 100% Yogurt with chocolate shaving, with cream, with sugar 33.3% 100% 3 Cheese , fresh Cream cheese, min 60% fat in dry mass 50% 100% Mozzarella 50% 100% 4 Cheese, soft Soft cheese (average without fat reduced products) 100% 100% 5 Cheese, hard Hard and semi hard cheese, full fat (average) 100% 100% Meat, fish, eggs 6 Red meat -

(2) Yoghurt We differentiated between natural and sweetened yoghurt . Sweetened yoghurt are relevant from a sustainability point of view. Meat, fish, eggs (7) Poultry For nutrient calculation we used 50% chicken breast with skin and 50% without skin to get an average nutrient intake . (8) Processed meats Meat balls: The kcal and nutrient values do not contain the fat used for preparation. This could be included in the Modelling. Chicken nuggets: In the Table we added the French Ciqual A NSES data for chicken nuggets. In case a Swiss nutrient value needs to be used we propose as alternative option the chicken burger with ID 13460. This might include the nutrient values including the bread (sandwich) which needs to be checked. (9, 11) Fish (o mega 3 rich and poor) Tuna was split in canned (low fat, and omega 3) and the fresh tuna was added to the omega 3 rich fish. We agreed on weigh ting factors with total salmon 45%, tuna 40% other fatty fish 15% Difficult to find data for Pangasius. In the French nutrient database, a value for cooked fish fillet is provided. As an alternative we propose to use the average whitefish with ID 211 and 101 kcal. (10) Shellfish Shrimp: edible part was based on cooked shrimps Scallop, as an alternative the same nutrients as for mussels can be used from the Swiss food composition database. Vegetable and alternative proteins (13) Legumes We used nutrition value for dried soybeans. Potentially re - calculation of data needed if for the environmental impact calculation data from fresh soybeans was used (14) Meat substitutes, vegan, minimally processed No data on Seitan was available. For Tofu we used the 2 available types of tofu for the nutrient calculation due to the difference in calcium. (15) Meat substitutes, vegan, highly processed No nutrient data in the public database. (16) Milk alternatives For the milk alternatives we have only branded products with limited nutrition data in the Swiss Database. This data could potentially be taken from the Ciqual ANSES database. There is only environmental data on the non -fortified versions, but from an environmental point of view, there is not much difference expected. It can be a suggestion to factor in some \"theoretical \" fortification during the modelling phase. 202 Food Group Food items Comments Oils & fats (25) Vegetable fats In the Swiss nutrient database, the available product is the 80% fat margarine. However also many light versions are on the market. Therefore, we propose either to use the Ciqual average product with 30 -40% fat or to remove this food from the list. (26,27,28) Oils For oils we used a similar weighting for all groups of 90% of the most commonly used oil and 10% for another less commonly used oil that was available in the database. (30) Nuts and seeds Hazelnuts: the edible part was defined based on following publication: M iloevi, Tomo & Miloevi, Neboja . (2017). the edible part was defined based on following publication that was retracted www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/147365/ . However, no other data source could be found and the reasons for retraction do not lead us to think that this value is incorrect. (31) Olives We used the two available foods in the nutrient database to calculate an average kcal value. Edible part for olives at farm ranged between 70 -85% and therefore we used 77.5%.

The reported minimum, optimal and maximum amounts of food groups per NCD were stated. If it was not possible to allocate a specific NCD, the term \"Various\" was used. As expected, and described in the research proposal, in most cases there are no sc ientific data available to define the exact minimum, maximum and optimum amounts. In this case, the most frequent data from dietary recommendations from the comparison of dietary recommendations (WP5) were used to complete the data. However, it must be not ed that the reviewed dietary guidelines also differ in their recommendations or do not include all of the food groups in such detail. They were only cited if there is a certain consensus / the recommendation appears in more than one country. Furthermore, r ecommendations from the FCN report 2019 (1) were stated when available. 205 Table 55: Estimation of minimum, optimal, and maximum daily amount of food groups in relation to NCD .

Reappraisal of the scientific evidence linking consumption of foods from specific food grou ps to NCD - report. Bern, Switzerland 2019. 119 p. 210 7 Restric tions This report is an update of the 20 19 FCN report \"Reappraisal of the scientific evidence linking consumption of foods from specific food groups to non -communicable diseases\". As the methodology and food grouping differ ed, it was not feasible to merge the two reports. Therefore, it was decid ed, to report the 2019 FCN findings into each food group subchapter (see chapter 2) and to declar e new or contradictory findings. Also, and a s in the 2019 report, the target population of this report was healthy adults (aged 18+ years); younger people or specific conditions (i.e., pregnancy, lactation, and disease) were not considered. Furthermore, d uring the literature search, it became evident for the authors that many studies associating foods to NCD failed to provide dose -response results. He nce, and somewhat surprisingly to the authors, in many cases it was not possible to present data regarding which amounts of food should be consumed to prevent NCD . As a recommendation, it would be seminal that future meta -analyses provide dose -response rel ationships enabling the assessment of food intake ranges providing health benefits. 8 Summary and c onclusion NCD represent a major burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide as well as in Switzerland . An unhealthy diet is the most important risk factor for NCD , and accounts for approximately 80% of Swiss healthcare costs. The Swiss food based dietary guidelines are one of the measures within the Swiss Nutrition Policy to enable the Swiss population to eat a healthy, varied and balanced diet. The last major update of the current dietary guidelines goes back to 2011. The Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office FSVO commissioned the project team to update the 2019 report from the FCN and complete it with inf ormation on ecological effects of food consumption. The present report therefore focused on literature from 2018 to 2021 for the foods present in the 2019 FCN report and from 2015 onwards for new foods . It summarises the associations between food groups and different NCD , and takes ecological effects of food production and consumption into account. It also lists and compares dietary guidelines from neighbouring countries and major international organisations. The data prov ided relate to healthy adults in the age range 18 to 65 years. Other age groups such as toddlers, children, adolescents or elderly, or specific physiological conditions such as pregnancy and lactation, were not considered. Also, dietary recommendations aim ed at mitigating existing diseases such as diabetes or obesity were not considered . The report is the result of a collaborative task of researchers from all over Switzerland, who joined efforts to summarize a large body of literature and data. The authors hope that the herewith provided body of data and information will benefit the Swiss population and lead the path to a healthier, sustainable diet. It shall serve the FSVO as a scientific basis to review and update the current dietary guidelines. The major findings are as follows : From a nutritional point of view, most of the current Swiss dietary guidelines for healthy adults can be maintained. However, t he following aspects need to be revi sited : - Fruit (and vegetable) juices: Move from \"fruit and vegetable \" group to top level of pyramid with \"sugared and sweetened beverages \" as fruit juices do not provide the same health effects as whole fruits . - Potato es: Limit (deep -)fried potato products as there is strong evidence of adverse health effects on se veral NCDs. - Meat, fish, egg s: Promote diversification of protein sources , including plant -based alternatives more clearly . This will reinforce the consumption of vegetarian protein sources and the limitation of meat (especially red and processed varieties) and fish . 211 - Dairy products: Promote diversification as fermented products ( yoghurt s) seem to have beneficial health effects. No need to focus on fat content of dairy products , but restrict sweetened dairies . Consider having a specific category for dairy products (separate from other protein sources) . - Legumes and pulses: Reconsider position and move from \"starchy level\" to \"protein level\" to promote the consumption of plant -based protein sources . - Ultra -processed foods: Limit consumption as evidence for detrimental health effects is growing . - Nuts, seeds, oleaginous foods: Reconsider position in the food pyramid to promote consumption - Oils, fats: No need to limit butter as suggested by 2019 FCN report. In many cases it was not possible to define an optimal intake of the food considered, as most results presented were for a change in consumption (i.e., a one -portion increase) rather than for a given amount consumed. We strongly recommend that future studies on the association between foods and NCDs include a dose -response graph where the effect of different a mounts consumed can be visualized. It should also be stressed that, when available, the recommended amounts should not be taken for granted, and should be considered taking into account the gender, body size, and physical activity levels of the person. Favouring the consumption of more beneficial foods over others will be more effective than imposing specific amounts for each food type or group. Recommendations towards a healthy eating might either be consistent or in conflict with environmental issues, as indicated in the table 56 . We considered synergy for the following combinations of recommendations and environmental issues : \"consumption recommended \" + \"low environmental impact \" and \"consumption not recommended \" + \"high environmental impact \", and conflict otherwise (for example, \"consumption recommended\" + \"high environmental impact\") . Most foods with a high environmental impact (e.g. red meat or chocolate) should also be limited for health reasons . The health benefits of fish, legumes, nuts & seeds are mitigated by their higher environmental impact, while the environmental impact for fruits & vegetables is low compared to other food g roups ( on the production method ). Eggs, cereals & starchy foods combine health benefits and a n average environmental impact. Fruit juices have a low environmental impact but their health benefits are non -existent. Overall, any dietary recommendation will h ave a certain environmental impact , which can be reduced if adequate products and production methods are chosen. In this context, i t must also be taken into account that undesirable environmental effects can in turn have a negative impact on health. 212 Table 56: current Swiss dietary recommendations and corresponding environmental issues.
