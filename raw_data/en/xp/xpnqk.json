One of the topics selected in 2015 is arthroscopy of the knee, based on the Swiss Healt h Observatory (Obsan) report No. 42 \"Variations g\u00e9ographiques dans les soins de sant\u00e9. La situation en Suisse\", which reported an increase of the rate of inpatient knee arthroscopie s by 20% between 2005 and 2011. According to the report, the rates of inpat ient arthroscopies differed markedly between cantons, i.e. cantons below the 10th percentile showed a standardized rate of 121 arthroscopies per 100'000 inhabitants, while cantons above the 90th percentile showed a standardized rate of 415.6 per 100'000 in habitants. In addition, the proportion of inpatient and outpatient arthroscopies varied strongly from 16% up to 75% between cantons . These observations raise questions regarding the appropriate use and the benefit of knee arthroscopy . 1.1.2 Aim This HTA report a ims at assess ing the clinical effectiveness and safety of therapeutic knee arthroscopy compared to any other treatment in patients with degenerative changes of the knee - irrespective of whether they are primarily due to meniscal damage, osteoarthritis of the knee or a mix of both ; inpatient compared to outpatient therapeutic knee arthroscopy. Also, this HTA report aims at assess ing the cost -effectiveness of therapeutic knee arthroscopy compared to any other treatment in patients with de generative changes of the knee - irrespective of whether they are primarily due to meniscal damage, osteoarthritis of the knee or a mix of both ; the cost -effectiveness of inpatient compared to outpatient therapeutic knee arthroscopy; the budget impact of knee arthroscopy in patients with degenerative changes of the knee primarily due to meniscal damage . 1.1.3 Clinical effectiveness and safety For this HTA report , clinical effectiveness and safety of knee arthroscopy in patients with symptoma tic knee degeneration were addressed. Clinical effectiveness and safety of the setting (inpatient versus outpatient) in which therapeutic arthroscopy was performed were also studied . The literature search was conducted in July 2017 and filters for randomis ed controlled trials (RCT s) were used. The search was not restricted by time period or by language. RCT characteristics and results of the included RCTs were presented in tables and summarised Seite 17 descriptively. The main focus of the analysis was the results at short -term follow -up (6 months), intermediate follow -up ( >6 months and <7 years) and long -term follow -up (longest follow -up time including and longer than seven years). Risk of bias was asse ssed according to the Cochrane Handbook , and the quality of evidence was assessed according to GRADE for short -term and intermediate follow -up. When possi ble, clinical outcome results were summarised quantitatively in a meta -analysis by using inverse varia nce models assuming random effects. Effect estimates (overall and for each RCT ) with corresponding 95% confidence interval s (CIs) were presented as forest plots. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated for binary outcomes. Continuous outcomes were presented a s mean differences (MDs) . If continuous outcomes were measured with different instrument (i.e. different scales ) by the individual RCTs , the results of the individual RCTs were standardi zed, and the standardi zed mean differences (SMDs) were reported . In case of considerable heterogeneity, methodological and clinical factors that might explain the heterogeneity were explored in subgroup and sensitivity analyses where possible. Pre-specified subgroup/sensitivity analyses addressed patients wi th symptoms mainly due to meniscal degeneration ( degenerative meniscus of the knee, DMK) versus patients with symptoms mainly due to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee versus mixed population s with concurrent DMK and OA; RCTs in which a non -active comparator was used versus those RCTs in which an active comparator was used. There were 21 RCTs (including more than 2,000 patients ) identified for the assessment of clinical effectiveness and safety of arthroscopy in patients with degenerative knee symptoms . Data were extracted for short -term follow -up and intermediate follow -up, for the outcomes of pain, function, global assessment (combined pain, function and/or stiffness) , joint stiffness, occurrence of total knee replacement, quality of life, adv erse events and serious adverse event. There were no statistically significant differences between arthroscopy and comparator found for the outcomes of function, global assessment, joint stiffness, total knee replacement and quality of life at short - term ( 6 months) or intermediate follow -up ( >6 months and <7 years). There was a small statistically significant effect in favour of arthroscopy in the outcome of pain at short -term follow - up ( SMD -0.16, 95% CI [ -0.31, -0.01]), while no statistically significant difference was found at intermediate follow -up. None of the included RCTs reported outcomes at long -term follow -up. There was limited evidence o f harms reported by the RCTs; therefore, it was difficult to assess the overall clini cal effectiveness with regards to benefits and harms of arthroscopy. The overall quality of evidence was judged to be very low at short -term follow -up because of the very low quality of evidence for the critical outcome of function. The overall quality of evidence was judged to be low at intermediate follow -up because of the low quality of evidence for the critical outcomes of pain, function and global assessment. One RCT (100 patients) was identified for the assessment of the clinical effectiveness and sa fety of arthroscopy in the inpatient and outpatient setting s. This RCT reported only on pain within a week of discharge and found no difference . The overall quality of evidence was judged to be very low. Seite 18 1.1.4 Cost -effectiveness and budget impact To gain underst anding of the cost -effectiveness of therapeutic knee arthroscopy compared to any other treatment in patients with degenerative changes of the knee, the available published literature was analysed. The analysis was based on a literature search using the sam e search terms as in the clinical effectiveness and safety section of this report, in combination with economic terms. After screening of the search results to identify eligible studies, extraction of relevant information, assessment of quality of reportin g according to the CHEERS checklist, and assessment of transferability to Switzerland (for international studies) were performed. For the studies judged to be qualitatively transferable, cost estimates were adapted to Switzerland and cost -effectiveness res ults re -calculated. Four cost -effectiveness studies were identified . Two compared knee arthroscopy to non - operative treatment and showed discordant results: one suggested that knee arthroscopy was more expensive and less effective than non -operative interventions alone from both the societal and healthcare payer perspecti ve; the other suggested that knee arthroscopy was more costly and more effective (incremental cost -effectiveness ratio [ICER] better than CHF 30,000 per quality adjusted life year [QALY] gained) from a healthcare payer perspective or even cost -saving from a societal perspective, if compared to physical therapy alone. To understand the reasons behind this discrepancy, both publications as well as the sources used in their calculations were analysed in detail. In both cases, relevant methodological flaws were found. Two other studies c omparing preoperative status with postoperative status suggested that knee arthroscopy may be cost - effective with ICERs of CHF 7,200 to 7,300 per QALY gained. However, pre -post clinical studies do not represent a reliable basis f or deciding whether an intervention is cost -effective or not. Given the very limited health economic evidence, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the cost - effectiveness of arthroscopic surgery in patients with degenerative changes of the knee. Alt hough three of four available studies reported arthroscopy to be cost -effective, this cannot be regarded as convincing. The budget impact analysis focused on the costs of knee arthroscopy in patients with degenerative changes of the knee primarily due to m eniscal damage, from a health insurance system perspective in Switzerland . Two steps were performed : first, the annual frequency of knee arthroscopies in Switzerland was investigated; second, based on the annual frequency, the total annual costs were estim ated. The frequency in the inpatient setting was investigat ed using diagnosis -related (DRG) codes, ICD -10 codes, and Swiss classification of surgical interventions (CHOP) codes provided in the Swiss Hospital Statistics for the years 2010 to 2014. Two analy tical strategies were used: in the first, only patients who reported at the same time a relevant DRG code, at least one relevant diagnosis (ICD -10 code), and at least one relevant treatment (CHOP code) were included. In the second strategy, all patients wh o had at the same time at least one relevant diagnosis (ICD -10 code) and one relevant treatment (CHOP code), irrespective of the reported DRG codes, were included. To assess the frequency of arthroscopies in the outpatient setting, an analysis of medical t ariff (TARMED) codes in 2013 and 2014 provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health was used. The unit costs for the budget impact calculation were based on data from the diagnosis -related case costs statistics provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Statistics (\"Statistik diagnosebezogener Fallkosten \") and on published estimat es. The results of the budget impact analysis suggested that the total expenditure for knee/meniscus derangement in Switzerland ranged from CHF 53.52 CHF 67.73 Mio. in 2014. Outpatient costs accounted for 20 -28% of the total costs. Seite 19 The results of the analysis according to our second patient selection strategy, based on ICD-10 codes and CHOP codes, are considered more realistic than those according to the first strategy also considering DRG codes. This second strategy suggested total inpatient costs of CHF 58.10 CHF 54.47 Mio. in 2014. Total outpatient costs were estimated to be CHF 14.73 Mio. in 2013 and CHF 13.26 Mio. in 2014. The results of the budget impact analysis according to the first patient selection strategy seemed to be qui te uncertain due to the changes (from All Patients Diagnosis -Related Group [APDRG ] until 2011 to Swiss DRG from 2012 onwards ) and inconsistencies in the DRG coding system. The results of the budget impact analysis are in line with those results reported in a very recent publication of the Swiss Health Observatory (Obsan) . Assuming approximately 14 ,000 meniscectomies per year and inpatient costs of CHF 4,889 per case, the authors of the Obsan report estimated total inpatient costs of CHF 55.6 Mio. in 2016. 1.1.5 Conclusion In conclusion , there is no evidence that knee arthroscopic interventions in patients with degenerative changes of the knee have any benefit on outcomes measured at short or intermediate follow -up, with the exception of a small effect on the reduction of pain at short follow -up. Therefore, it remains unclear whether knee arthroscopy has an effect on the assessed outcomes. Long -term follow -up data are not available. Reporting on harm was scarce and no conclusion s can be drawn regarding the b enefit -harm balance. The overall quality of evidence at short and intermediate follow -up was judged to be very low and low, respectively. In addition, there is no evidence that the subgroup of patients with solely DMK has a benefit from arthroscopic treatment. The clinical effectiveness findings of this assessment may be generalizable to a broader population e xperiencing knee pain due to a degenerative knee disorder. The findings are consistent with recently published systematic reviews. Given very limited health economic evidence, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the cost - effectiveness of arthroscop ic surgery in patients with degenerative changes of the knee. Although three of four available studies reported arthroscopy to be cost -effective, this cannot be regarded as convincing, given the methodological issues described and also in light of the resu lts of the assessment of effectiveness.

One of the topics selected in 2015 is arthroscopy of the knee , based on the Swiss Health Observatory (Obsan) report No. 42 \" Variations g\u00e9ographiques dans les soins de sant\u00e9. La situation en Suisse \", which reported an increase of inpatient knee arthroscopies and an increase of the rate of knee arthroscopies by 20% between 2005 and 2011.1 According to the report , the rates of inpatient arthroscopies differed markedly between cantons , i.e. cantons at the lower 10th percentile showed a standardized rate of 121 arthroscopies per 100,000 inhabitants , while cantons at the upp er 90th percentile showed a standardized rate of 415.6 per 100,000 inhabitants .1 In addition , the proportion of inpatient a nd outpatient arthroscopies varied strongly between cantons ( from 16% in the lowest decile to 75% in the highest ), raising questions regarding the appropriate use and the benefit of knee arthroscopies .1 A recent observational study by Muheim et al. reported that around 68% of Swiss patients who underwent arthroscopic parti al meniscectomy or debridement and lavage were inpatients .2 This might be due to the fact the strong financial incentives exist in Switzerland to provide knee arthroscopy as in hospital service. During the scoping process conducted on behalf of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (SFOPH), first data on existing evidence syntheses regarding the clinical effectiveness and costs of knee arthroscopies were identified . In addition, Swiss data on the use of knee arthroscopy , across all indications, were analysed. Table 40 in Appendix 1 illustrates the main results , concern ing the most frequent diagnoses according to the Swiss Hospital Statistics 2014 .3 Overall, it was estimated that about 25,000 patients were hospitalized in 2014 with a diagnosis of knee or meniscus derangement or meniscus tear.3 Depending on the costs and effects of the treatments, such a large number of patients may imply a high budget impact for the Swiss healthcare sy stem. 2.2 Scoping process Based on the discussion of the results with clinical expert s and the review group (composed by SFOPH ), SFOPH commissioned the Swiss Medical Board (SMB) with the assessment of the clinical effectiveness and cost -effectiveness ( Wirksamkeit und Wirtschaftlichkeit ) of arthroscopic interventions in patients with degenerative changes of the menisci and to update the March 2014 report of the German Institute for Qual ity and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) on the arthroscopic treatme nt of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.4 Clinical effectiveness Based on the discussion in the IQWiG report4 and discussion s with clinical experts it was apparent that symptoms that are due to degenerative changes of the meniscus and tho se that are due to OA of the knee cannot be clearly distinguished. The clinical effectiveness of arthroscopic interventions in the knee for OA has been recently assessed by the IQWiG report and hence the main interest of SFOPH regarded the question whether the evidence for these interventions in the Seite 31 case of degenerative meniscal changes is any different. In order to take into account the difficulty of separating the two pathologies and the main interest of SFOPH, it was decided to first perform a pool ed ana lysis for both populations . This had the additional advantage of allowing us to consider RCTs conducted in mixed populations. During the scoping process, which involved a review process with clinical experts and a stakeholder consultation, the original questions by SFOPH were transformed into specific PICO research questions, specifying populations (P), interventions (I), compara tors (C) and outcomes (O) of interest. Given the above considerations, it was decided first to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of knee arthroscopy in patients with degenerative changes of the knee in general (i.e. including patients with main ly meniscal symptoms, those with symptoms mainly due to OA of the knee, and those with mixed degenerative changes or covered in RCTs with mixed populations). Potential differences between populations were to be assessed in subgroup analyses. Only if releva nt differences between the populations were to be found in the subgroup analyses, further analyses would be performed separately, with the addition of a separate second PICO. During the scoping process, a third PICO was defined to assess the differences i n effects depending on whether knee arthroscopy was performed in an inpatient or outpatient setting. For the purposes of this report, the third PICO addressing inpatient or outpatient setting was changed to 'PICO 2 ' as the original second PICO was dropped since we found no relevant subgroup effects . The evaluation of the quality of the evidence regarding clinical effectiveness was done according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) . Health economic characteristics For the health economic analyses, a similar process was undertaken . It was decided to systematically review the available economic literature in order to investigate the impact of arthroscopic knee interventions in terms of cost -effectiveness , from a Swis s perspective. Moreover, it was decided to perform a budget impact analysis using Swiss epidemiological data and cost data. 2.3 Aim of the assessment report According to SFOPH and SMB , the aim of this HTA is twofold: Fi rst, to provide an evidence base for di scussion with different stakeholders , regarding the benefit, harm , and economic implications , of arthroscopic meniscectomy and other small arthroscopic intervent ions in patients with degenerative changes in the knee joint . Second, to provide an evidence base regarding the appropriate setting (i.e. inpatient versus outpatient) for therapeutic knee arthroscopy . Specifically, t his HTA report aims at assess ing the clinical effectiveness and safety of therapeutic knee arthroscopy compared to any o ther treatment s in patients with degenerative changes of the knee - irrespective of whether they are primarily due to meniscal damage, OA of the knee or a mix of both ; inpatient compared to outpatient therapeutic knee arthroscopy . Also, this HTA report aims at assess ing Seite 32 the cost -effectiveness of therapeutic knee arthroscopy compared to any other treatment in patients with degenerative changes of the knee - irrespective of whether they are primarily due to meniscal damage, osteoarth ritis of the knee or a mix of both; the cost -effectiveness of inpatient compared to outpatient therapeutic knee arthroscopy; the budget impact of knee arthroscopy in patients with degenerative changes of the knee primarily due to meniscal damage. The focus on any degenerative changes of the knee in the clinical and cost -effectiveness part s versus on changes primarily due to meniscal damage in the budget impact part follows the priorities defined in the final scoping document. Seite 33 3 Clinical effectivenes s and safety 3.1 Methods 3.1.1 Literature search This assessment aims at updat ing the report4 completed by the IQWiG in 2014 on patients with OA of the knee . Therefore , the same search strategies as in the IQWiG report were used . Additional search terms were added to cover patients with degenerative changes of the menisci. Relevant RCTs were identified by searching the following electronic databases: Medline via Ovid SP EMBASE via Ovid SP Cochrane Database of Systematic Review s via Wiley Online Library Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via Wiley Online Library Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects via Wiley Online Library Health Technology Assessment Database via Wiley Online Li brary The databases were searched from inception until July 201 7. The search strategy combined search terms for knee arthroscopy, osteoarthritis and degenerative disease with a search filter for RCTs , literature reviews and meta -analyses, as used in the 2014 IQWiG report .4 Search terms related to 'meniscus' were added to the originally conducted IQWiG searches. See Appendix 2 for details of search strategies used. Additionally, the ref erence lists of relevant systematic and narrative reviews , HTAs and guidelines were screened to identify further relevant RCTs . Searches for on -going RCTs were conducted in the following clinical trial registries: U.S. National Institutes of Health. Clin icalTrials.gov [online]. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov World Health Organization. International Registry Platform Search Portal [online]. URL: http://apps.who.int/trialsearch 3.1.2 Screening of the literature After removing duplicates , two reviewers ind ependently screened the titles and abstracts of the identified records for potentially eligible RCTs , reviews, HTAs and guidelines . If one of the reviewers deemed a study to be potentially relevant, the study was included , and the corresponding full text a rticle was screened. Subsequently, two reviewers independently screened the full text articles of the potentially eligible studies in order to identify eligible RCTs. Reference lists of relevant reviews, HTAs and guidelines were screened independently by t wo reviewers in order to identify potential ly eligible RCTs. Discrepant screening results were discussed and resolved by consensus or by third party arbitration. Seite 34 3.1.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria - PICO 1 3.1.3.1 Population Patients with symptoms due to d egenerative changes of the knee - irrespective of whether they are pri marily due to meniscal damage, OA of the knee or a mix of both - were included. RCTs on patients with symptoms mainly due to OA of the knee were identified based on the criteria used in the IQWiG report , namely: The diagnosis of OA of the knee should have been made based on the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumat ology (ACR).5 Alternatively , similar definitions of OA of the knee were used as long as they were based on the classic diagnostic criteria for arthrosis (knee pain, morning stiffness less than 30 minutes, crepitus on active motion, and/or osteophytes). In order to be included , at least 80% of the study population had to fit these criteria. The definition of patients with symptoms due to meniscal degenerative changes was based on the definition given by the authors of eligible RCTs. RCT s in patients where pre-operative symptoms or intraoperative findings indicat ive o f serious, primarily non -arthrotic changes in the knee (e.g. (acute) traumatic meniscal tears, free joint bodies) dominate d were excluded .4 RCTs of patients with traumatic knee injuries to other structures of the knee that tend to be associated with significant additional trauma to the meniscus or cartilage (e.g. tears of the cruciate ligaments) were excluded . 3.1.3.2 Intervention Arthroscopy with a ny arthroscopic intervention that include s one or more procedure s related to debridement, synovectomy, lavage or any intervention at the synovia, the cartilage of the joint or the menisci. 3.1.3.3 Comparators Placebo, no treatment, conservative treatment or any other surgical treatment a. Non-active treatment s like: No therapeutic intervention Sham arthroscopy Diagnostic arthroscopy b. Active treatment like: Lavage (without arthroscopy) -surgical treatment (drug treatment , physiotherapy, or acupuncture ) Surgical treatment (open surgery or arthroscopic surgery not applied to cartilage, meniscus or synovia, but for example of ligaments or bone ) Seite 35 3.1.3.4 Outcomes Health outcomes like mortality, morbidity or quality of life and safety outcomes like adverse events and serious adverse events were assessed . The importance of outcomes was classified according to GRADE, which differentiates critical, important, and less important outcomes. The latter are considered not to be relevant for decision - making , and are therefore not covered in th is report. Critical outcomes have a major impact on decision -making and the quality of the evidence available for these outcomes is the basis for judging the overall quality of the evidence for a clin ical question. Critical outcomes: 1. Pain 2. Function 3. Global assessment (e.g. WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoa rthritis Index)6 or KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score),7 combined with joint stiffness, physical function) Important outcomes: 1. Joint stiffness 2. Time to total knee replacement 3. Quality of life (health -related and disease -specific) 4. Adverse events (including subsequen t surgeries) 5. Serious adverse events Subjective outcomes (e.g. health -related quality o f life) were only considered if they were assessed with valid ated measurement instruments. The relevant time points were defined depending on the available evidence. 3.1.3.5 Study designs RCTs and quasi -randomis ed trials ; the effectiveness of knee arthroscopy was assessed based on RCTs as studies of this type tend to minimize bias compared to observational studies.8 3.1.4 Inclusion and exclusion criteria - PICO 2 3.1.4.1 Population Patients with symptoms due to degenerat ive changes of the knee - irrespective of whether they are primarily due to meniscal damage, OA of the knee or a mix of both - were included (see section 3.1.3.1 ). 3.1.4.2 Intervention Any therapeutic i npatient arthroscopic intervention was included. Seite 36 The following arthroscopic interventions at the knee were relevant: debridement, synovectomy, or lavage , interventions at the synovia, the cartilage of the joint or the menisci. 3.1.4.3 Comparator Any therapeutic o utpatient arthroscopic intervention was included (see section 3.1.3.2 ). The intervention performed in an inpatient setting was compared to the same intervention being performed in an outpatient setting. 3.1.4.4 Outcomes Health outcomes like mortality, morbidity or quality of life and safety outcomes like adverse events and serious adverse events were the same as defined in section 3.1.3.4 for PICO 1. The relevant time points were defined depending on the available evidence. 3.1.4.5 Study designs RCTs and quasi -randomis ed trials (see section 3.1.3.5 ). 3.1.5 Data extraction Data on RCT characteristics and outcomes, by RCT arm where applicable, were extracted into a standardized form by one reviewer and checked by another. Discrepancies were res olved by discussion or third -party arbitration. Extracted data on RCT characteristics included publication date, country, enrolment period, number of sites, follow -up visits, and descriptions of intervention, comparator, population and key inclusion crite ria. Additionally, baseline characteristics of the RCT population were extracted for intervention and comparator groups. Continuous outcome data were extracted as mean values for each intervention group at follow -up or, if not reported, as mean change fro m baseline. If more than one measurement instrument was used for the critical outcomes of pain , function and global assessment, a published hierarchy for outcomes was used.9 In the case of (serious) adverse events, only the number of patients experiencing a t least o ne adverse event w ere analysed and not the number of events. If only the number of events w ere reported, this information was extracted, but was not used for the analysis. Outcome data were extracted for sho rt-term follow -up time (closest to and including six months ), an intermediate follow -up time ( >6 months and <7 years ) and a long -term follow -up time (longest follow -up time including and longer than seven years) . Safety outcomes were only reported for the intermediate or long -term follow -up time s. 3.1.6 Risk of bias assessment One reviewer assessed the internal validity (risk of bias) of each RCT , which was checked by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or third -party arbitration. Seite 37 To assess the risk of bias of individual RCT s the following criteria were used :8 10 -25 adequate random sequence generation adequate concealment of treatment allocation adequate blinding of patients, health carers, and outcome assessors completeness of outcome data reporting bias Blinding of outcome assessors and completeness of outcome data were judged at the outcome level. 3.1.7 Assessment of the quality of evidence (GRADE) The quality of the evidence was judged according to GRADE for the critical and important outcomes; i.e. at the outcome level , by considering all available RCT s for the respective outcome . The following criteria were considered to judge the quality of the evidence:8 11 -25 Criteria for rating down the quality of evidence: risk of bias (internal validity) , section 3.1.6 inconsistency indirectness imprecision (see Judgment of imprecision below) publication bias Criteria for rating up the quality of evidence: large magnitude of effect dose -response gradient all plausible confounders or biases increase the confidence in the estimated effect Judgment of imprecision The judgement of imprecision according to GRADE12 was based on the total sample size for continuous outcomes or on the number of events for binary outcomes. If the total sample size or number of events was judged to be sufficient (optimal information size, OIS) , the width of the confidence interval around the point estimate was examined. For continuous outcome measures , the 95% confidence interval ( CI) was judged as precise as long as it excluded the line of no effect and a clinic ally relevant effect at the same time. In order to judge how clinically relevant pooled effect estimates of continuous measures might be for the patient, the concept of minimal clinically important differences (MCID) was used when data were pooled on the o riginal scale. If different instruments were used, data were pooled using a standardized scale. In case of continuous outcome measures, data were pooled on a standardized scale and an effect was judged to be precis e if the 95% CI included 0.5 standard dev iations (SDs) either in favour or against combination therapy and excluded the line of no effect.26 27 In case of binary data, effects were judged to be precis e if the 95% CI included a relative risk increase of greater than 25% either in favour or against arthroscopy and excluded the line of no effect.10 12 Seite 38 Using the GRADE software (GRADEpro GDT, https://gdt.guidelinedevelopment.org) , results were presented in a summary of findings table. The definition of the four levels of evidence according to GRADE is described in Table 1.8 Table 1 Quality levels of evidence Quality level Definition High We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect Moderate We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different Low Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect ma y be substantially different from the estimate of the effect Very low We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different form the estimate of effect 3.1.8 Evidence synthesis RCT characteristics and ba seline characteristics were presented in tables and summaris ed descriptively. Where poss ible, outcome data were summaris ed quantitatively in a meta -analysis by using inverse variance weighting models assuming random effects .28 Outcome data were pooled for a short-term follow -up time (closest to and including six months ), an intermediate follow -up time (longest follow -up time until seven years) and a long -term follow -up time (the longest follow -up time beyond seven years ). The analyses were performed using Review Manager (Version 5.3.5) . In case of multiple -arm RCTs , results of treatment arms were combined for the meta -analysis according to the Cochrane Handbook , where appropriate .10 If missing SDs could not be calculated based on other information given in the publication, or were not provided by RCT authors, they were approximated by estimating plausible SDs based on available SDs from the other RCTs reporting on the same or a similar outcome.10 Estimated SDs were kept sufficiently large to be considered as \"conservative assumption s\", to avoid inappropriate precision leading to an overestimation of the overall effect estimate or to cause artificial heterogeneity. Relative risks were calculated for binary outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. Effect estimates (summary estimates and single ones for each RCT ) with their corresponding 95% CI were presented in forest plots. In case of continuous data, mean treatment group differences at follow -up were pooled with differences in mean change s from baseline in the same analysis if necessary, either on the origi nal scale or by using standardis ed mean differences (SMD s).10 29 SMD s were pooled if a continuous Seite 39 outcome was measured on different scales because different instruments were used to assess the outcome. Results were standardis ed using the following formula: SMD = ( mean intervention - mean comparator )/SD pooled In other words, t he SMD expresses the size of the intervention effect by each trial relative to the variability in that trial.10 Importantly, a SMD cannot be compared directly with the original scales. The p resence of heterogeneity in the pooled effect estimates was determined by using I2 and visual examination. The interpretation of I2 followed the guidance of the Cochrane Handbook for Interventions, where an I2 of 0% substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. The interpretation of the observed I2 value depend ed on other measures for heterogeneity, namely the Tau2 (where a value of Tau2 of 0.04, 0.09, and 0.16 represent ed low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively), the precision of the individual effect estimates of the included RCTs and visual examination .10 30 3.1.9 Subgroup and sensitivity analyses In case of substantial or considerable heterogeneity in the pooled effect estimates, methodological and clinical factors that might explain heterogeneity were explored in subgroup and sensitivity analyses . Additional sensitivity analyses could be added a posteriori . The following subgroup analyses were pre -specified: PICO 1 (therapeutic knee arthroscopy compared to other treatment) Patients with symptoms mainly due to meniscal degeneration versus patients with symptoms mainly due to OA of the knee versus mixed population Type of comparator (active versus non -active) Type of the arthroscopic intervention (e.g. debridement, partial meniscectomy) Gender Age Disease (severity, primary or secondary OA), e.g. severity of osteoarthritis at baseline Classification of d egenerative meniscus of the knee (DMK) versus osteoarthritis (OA) To assess the effect differences within the population of patients with symptomatic degenerative changes of the knee joint, RCT population s were classified as having symptoms primarily due t o degenerative meniscus of the knee (DMK only), osteoarthritis (OA only) or both DMK and OA (mixed). For a clear distinction between OA and DMK, clear information provided in the inclusion/exclusion criteria by the RCT authors was required, stating that DM K was an exclusion criterion for OA or vice versa. A fourth classification of 'mixed un clear ' was introduced for RCTs which did not clearly report either or both DMK or OA. Because differentiation between DMK and OA is difficult, classification was based o n any information provided by RCT authors (radiologic and clinical evidence, such as MRI ; Kellgren -Lawrence and Ahlb\u00e4ck classifications (see also Table 2)31 32; baseline characteristics; inclusion and exclusion criteria; etc.) and was decided by two reviewers reaching a consensus. The resulting subgroups were compared to those used in existing systematic reviews to ensure RCTs were classified in a similar manner.33-39 Seite 40 Table 2 Radiographic grading scales - Kellgren and Ahlb\u00e4ck classification Scale31 32 Grade and characteristics Kellgren - Lawrence 0 No joint space narrowing or reactive changes 1 Doubtful joint space narrowing , possible osteophytic lipping 2 Definite osteophytes, possible joint space narrowing 3 Moderate osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing , some sclerosis, possible bone -end deformity 4 Large osteophytes, marked joint space narrowing , severe sclerosis, definite bone ends deformity Ahlb\u00e4ck 0 Normal 1 Joint space narrowing is < 3 mm (with or without subchondral sclerosis) 2 Obliteration of joint space 3 Bone defect/loss <5 mm 4 Bone defect and/or loss 5-10 mm Type of comparator (n on-active versus active ) Type of c omparator was used to classify RCTs into two subgroups: no n-active comp arator or active comparator. Non -active comparator included no therapeutic treatment (when compared to intervention), sham or placebo arthroscopy, or diagnostic arthroscopy. Active treatment included lavage without arthroscopy non -surgical treatment (drug trea tment, physiotherapy, acupuncture, etc.) or surgical treatment (open surgical or arthroscopic) . PICO 2 (inpatient compared to outpatient therapeutic knee arthroscopy) DMK versus OA (only if subgroup in PICO 1 showed significant subgroup differences) Type of the arthroscopic intervention (debridement, partial meniscectomy) Gender Age Disease (severity, primary or secondary OA ), e.g. severity of osteoarthritis at baseline 3.2 Results 3.2.1 Results of the literature search The electronic literature search yielded 3,657 records ( Figure 1). After removing duplicates , 2,850 records were screened at title and abstract level , and 132 potential ly relevant studies and 69 relevant reviews, guidelines and/or HTAs were identified . One additional potential ly relevant Seite 41 review was identified from the 2014 IQWiG report. In total 132 potentially relevant full texts were screened for being relevant RCTs ; in addition, 70 reviews, guidelines and HTAs were screened to identify relevant RCTs. From the 202 full text articles screened, 21 RCTs were identifie d with one additional relevant RCT (Biedert 2000) found by sc reening relevant reviews, guidelines and HTAs . Hence, a total of 22 RCTs ( reported in 26 research articles and 18 published abstracts, protocols, comments) were included ( Figure 1). There were 21 RCTs (over 2048 patients , in two RCTs the number of patients was not reported ) identified for PICO 1 and one RCT (100 patients) identified for PICO 2 . Details regarding the search strategy and the number of RCTs and publications included in this report are documented in Appendix 2. The RCT selection process is presented in Figure 1. Seite 42 Figure 1 Results of literature search Seite 43 3.2.2 Overview of included RCTs Forty -three records relevant for PICO 1 (25 research articles and 18 abstracts, protocols and comments) and one record relevant for PICO 2 (1 research article) were identified, encompassing 21 relevant RCTs for PICO 1 a nd one RCT for PICO 2, respectively . References for all 26 research articles can be found in Table 3; a complete list of all references is provided in Appendix 3. An overview of time points of the outcomes analysed from each RCT is given in Table 4. Critical and important outcomes were extracted for short -term follow -up (6 months) and for intermediate follow -up (>6 months). The longest follow -up reported was five years; hence , no RCT with long -term follow -up data was identified. RCT characteristics and baseline characteristics are presented for all RCTs jointly, while analyses are presented by PICO.

A summary of the RCT characteristics and select ed baseline characteristics can be found in Table 5 and Table 6. Based on the chosen criteria to define the RCT populations , RCT s for sensitivity analyses were classified as follows: For five RCT s (FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014, Herrlin 2007, Kise 2016, Yim 2013) the RCT populations were classified as having only DMK and no or mild OA (DMK only) . In one RCT (Kirkley 2008) the RCT population was classified as having only OA and no DMK (OA only). In one RCT (MeTeOR) the RCT population was classified as 'mixed population' composed of patients having both OA and DMK. For the remaining 1 4 RCT s (Biedert 2000, Chang 1993, Forster 2003, Hamberg 1984, Kalunian 2000, Kang 2005, KIVIS, KORAL, Merchan 2015, Vermesan 2013) , RCT reports did not allow for a classification of the RCT populations ; therefore , the RCT populations of these RCT s were classified as 'mixed unclear' . The majority of RCTs were conducted in Europe : three (Gauffin 2014, Hamberg 1984, Herrlin 2007) in Sweden, three (Forster 2003, KIVIS, KORAL) in the U K, two (Kise 2016, \u00d8ster\u00e5s 2012) in Norway, and one each (Biedert 2000, FIDELITY, Merchan 1993) in Switzerland, Finland and Spain. Six RCTs were conducted in North America: five (Chang 1993, Kalunian 2000, MeTeOR, Moseley 1996, Moseley 2002) in the US, and one (Kirkley 2008) in Canada. Three Asian RCTs (Kang 2005, Saeed 2015, Yim 2013) were conducted in China, Pakistan and South Korea, respectively. For t he remaining RCT (Vermesan 2013) the country of origin could not be identified. Nine RCTs were conducted at multiple centres, nine were conducted at a sing le centre and in the remaining three , the setting was not reported. Two RCTs (Kang 2005, Vermesan 2013) randomised knees of patients, while the remaining 19 RCTs randomised patients to up to four treatment arms. Patient enrolment range d from 10 participants to 351 patients , with length of follow -up ranging from two months to 60 mo nths. Twelve RCTs (Biedert 2000, Chang 1993, Forster 2003, Hamberg 1984, Kang 2005, Kise 2016, KIVIS, Merchan 1993, \u00d8ster\u00e5s 2012, Saeed 2015 , 2013, Yim 2013) used active comparators consisting of lavage (Chang 1993), exercise therapy (\u00d8ster\u00e5s 2012 , Kise 2016, Yim 2013) , pharmaceutical therapy (Biedert 2000, Forster 2003, Kang 2005, KIVIS, Merchan 1993, Saeed 2015, Vermesan 2013) or other arthroscopic or surgical procedure (Hamberg 1984) . Nine RCTs (FIDELITY, ey 2002) . Three RCTs reported of patients and investigators ( FIDELITY, Kalunian 2000, Moseley 1996, Moseley 2002), while i n the remaining 18 RCT s either participants or investigators were not blinded or RCT s reports were unclear. PICO 2 One RCT (Weale 1998) was identified compar ing inpatient arthroscopic intervention to outpatient arthroscopic intervention in patients with degenerative disease of the knee. A summary of the RCT characteristics and select ba seline characteristics can be found in Table 5 and Table 6. The RCT took place in the UK at one site and had a follow -up period of 3 -4 weeks. Of the Seite 48 100 patients enrolled, 50 were randomis ed to overnight stay admission (inpatient), while 50 were randomis ed to day -case admission . Participants and investigators were not blinded.

Allocation concealment was adequate in eight RCTs, unclear in 11 and the risk of bias was high in two. The risk of performance bias was unclear in one RCT and high in 16. Only four RCTs had a low risk of perf ormance bias. Risk of d etection bias was low in four RCTs, unclear in six and high in eleven . For continuous outcome measurements , risk of attrition bias was high in seven RCTs , low in six and unclear in eight. For binary outcome measurement s, risk of attrition bias was rated high in four RCTs, unclear in three and low in four . Binary outcome measurements were not reported in ten RCTs ; therefore, the risk of attrition bias for binary outcomes was not judged . Finally, the risk of reporting bias was graded as low in two RCTs, high in one, and unclear in the remaining 16. An overview of the risk of bias assessment is shown in Table 7. A detailed description of the risk of bias assessment , including the reason s supporting judgement s, is provided in Appendix 6.

Pain - Short -term follow -up Pain was assessed in 16 RCTs with follow -up time s ranging from two to six months. Compared to control, arthroscopy was associated with less knee pain and this effect was statistically significant (SMD -0.16, 95% CI [ -0.31, -0.01 ] and should be in terpreted as a small effect , Figure 2; low quality of evidence, Table 13). In sensitivity analyses, when the RCT by Kalunian 2000 was excluded - the only RCT comparing arthroscopic lavage with diagnostic arthroscopy - the heterogeneity decreased to 12% without changing the overall effect estimate substantially (SMD -0.22, 95% CI [-0.34, -0.10], Figure 35 in Seite 72 Pain results from four RCTs (Moseley 1996, Saeed 2015, Kise 2016, Chang 1993) were not pooled for analys is, because pain was measure d as a binary /ordinal variable or due to methodological issues. Results of these RCT s are summaris ed in section 8.4.1.1 of Appendix 5. Figure 2 Pain at short -term follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA Four RCT s (FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014, Herrlin 2007, Yim 2013) were classified as reporting results for a population with DMK only. One RCT (MeTeOR) reported pain for a population with both DMK and OA (mix ed), while in seven RCTs (Chang 1993, Forster 2003, Kalunian 2000, KIVIS, KORAL, , \u00d8ster\u00e5s 2012 ), the population was insufficiently described and classified as mixed unclear. Only one RCT (Kirkley 2008) included patient s with OA without concurrent DMK (large meniscus tears were excluded). Effect estimates for pain in these subgroups did not statistically significantly differ and 95 % CIs largely overlapped . The SMD s were DMK CI ts with -0.10 ( 95% CI [ -0.41, 0.21 ]) for patients with OA only . Figure 3 shows the resulting forest plot with the four subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate.

There was no statistically significant ly different effect in RCT s comparing arthroscopy to non -active treatment (SMD -0.22, 95% CI [-0.55, 0.11]). Confidence intervals were largely overlapping. Figure 4 shows the resulting forest plot with the two subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate. Seite 74 Figure 4 Pain by comparator type at short -term follow -up Pain - Intermediate follow -up Eleven RCTs reported pain at an intermediate follow -up with follow -up times ranging from 12 to 60 months. Compared to control, arthroscopy did not have a statistically significant effect on reducing pain at intermediate follow -up (SMD -0.11, 95% CI [ -0.22, 0.00], Figure 5; low quality of evidence, Table 14). Heterogeneity between RCTs was low (I2=0%). Additional r esults (Chang 1993, Kise 2016, Yim 2013) that could not be pool ed were descriptively summaris ed in section 8.4.1.2 of Appendix 5. Seite 75 Figure 5 Pain at intermediate follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA Four RCT s (FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014, 2007, Yim with DMK only . One RCT (MeTeOR ) had patients with both DMK and OA (mixed), and in four RCTs (Chang 1993, Forster 200 3, Kalunian 2000, Moseley 2002) the population s were insufficiently described and were classified as mixed unclear. Only one RCT (Kirkley 2008) included patients with OA ( OA only) without concurrent DMK (large meniscus tears were excluded). Effect estimates for pain in these subgroups did not statistically significantly differ and 95% CIs largely overlapped. The SMDs were -0.20 (95% CI [ -0.51, for patient s with mixed OA and DMK of unclear pathology and -0.13 ( 95% CI [ -0.43, 0.18 ]) for the OA only subgroup . Figure 6 shows the resulting forest plot with the four subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate. Seite 76 Figure 6 Pain by DMK/OA classification at intermediate follow -up Subgroups: non -active versus active In seven RCTs (FIDELITY, Kalunian 2000, Kirkley 2008, arthroscopic surgery was compared to non -active comparators and in three (Chang 1993, Forster 2003, Yim 2013 ) with an active comparator . Compared to non -active treat ment, arthroscopy was associated with less knee pain, this effect was statistically significant (SMD -0.14, 95% CI [ -0.27, -0.01]) , but can only be interpreted as a small effect. There was no statistically significantly different effect in RCT s comparing arthro scopy 0.37]) . Effect estimates for pain in these subgroups did not statistically significantly differ and 95% CIs largely overlapped. Confidence intervals were largely overlapping. Figure 7 shows the resulting forest plot with the two subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate. Seite 77 Figure 7 Pain by comparator type at intermediate follow -up 3.2.4.2.2 Function Function was assessed by various instruments as shown in Table 9. For the purposes of this report, instrument s that combined measures of pain and function were defined as global assessment s of outcome (section 3.2.4.2.3 ), while those that only measured function (not pain) were defined as assessing the outcome of function .

There was no statistically significant effect on function (SMD - 0.08 , 95% CI [ -0.26, 0.09 ], Figure 8; very low quality of evidence, Table 13) in favour of arthroscopy when compared to control . Heterogeneity between RCTs was considerable (I2=50%) and could not be entirely explained in sensitivity analyses. However, the removal of the RCT by Forster 2003 reduce d the heterogeneity to I2=36% (see Figure 36 in section 3.2.4.4.2 ) without changing the effect estimate . In addition, MeTeOR reported binary results and Kise 2016 reported mean difference between groups comparison (see section 8.4.2.1 of Appendix 5), which could not be pooled in analyses . Figure 8 Function at short -term follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA Two RCT s (Gauffin 2014, Herrlin 2007) were classified as reporting results for a population with DMK only . One RCT (MeTeOR) reported function for a population with both DMK and OA (mixed), while in five RCT s (Chang 1993, Forster 2003, Kalunian 2000, KIVIS, Moseley 2 002), the population was insufficiently described and classified as mixed unclear. Only one RCT (Kirkley 2008) included a n OA only population without concurrent DMK (large meniscus tears were Seite 79 excluded) . Although the treatment effect in the mixed population of OA and DMK was statistically significant in favour of arthroscopy , the effect estimates in the subgroups were similar . The SMD s were -0.08 CI patients OA and DMK of unclear pathology and 0.08 (95% CI [ -0.23, 0.39 ]) for OA only subgroup. Figure 9 shows the resulting forest plot with the four subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate. Figure 9 Function by DMK/OA classification at short -term follow -up Subgroups: non -active versus active In six RCT s Kalunian 2000, Kirkley 2008, arthroscopic surgery was compared to non -active comparators, while in three RCT s (Chang 1993, Forster 2003, KIVIS) it was compared to active comparators. No statistically sign ificant effect on function was found when comparing arthrosco py to no n-active treatment (SMD -0.07 , 95% (SMD -0.08 [95% CI -0.74, 0.57]) . Figure 10 shows the resulting forest plot with the two subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate. Seite 80 Figure 10 Function by comparator type at short -term follow -up Functio n - Intermediate follow -up Function was a ssessed in nine RCT s with follow -up times ranging from 12 to 60 months. There was no statistically significant effect on function ( SMD -0.06, 95% CI [ -0.18, 0.07], Figure 11; low quality of evidence, Table 14) in favour of arthroscopy compared to control . Heterogeneity between RCT s was low (I2=0%). The observed effect in the RCT by Forster 2003 was in the opposite direction in comparison to the remaining RCT s, probably because function scores at baseline on the Knee Society rating system differed between the arthroscopy and control groups (45 versus 65 [on a zero to 100 scale]) ; excluding the RCT by Forster 2003 only slightly affected the overall effect estimate ( see sensitivity analysis, Figure 37 in section 3.2.4.4.2 ). Kise 2016 reported a small mean difference in function of 1.6 (95% CI [ -2.9, 6.1]) slightly (but not statistically significant ly) favouring the comparator group over the arthroscopy group at 24 months . This result could not be considered in the pooled analysis . Seite 81 Figure 11 Function at intermediate follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA Two RCT s (Gauffin 2014, wi th DMK only . One RCT (MeTeOR) included a population with both DMK and OA (mixed), while in four RCT s (Chang 1993, Forster 2003, Kalunian 2000, Moseley 2002), the population was insufficiently described and classified as mixed unclear. Only one RCT (Kirkley 2008) included patients with OA without concurrent DMK (large meniscus tears were excluded). Effect estimates for arthroscopy versus control in the four subgroups were similar and 95% CIs for largely overlapping. The SMDs were -0.15 and DMK , 0.0 0 (95% CI [-0.32, 0.33]) for patients with mixed OA and DMK of unclear pathology and -0.02 (95% CI [ - 0.33, 0.28]) for the OA only subgroup .

Various instruments were used to measure global assessment as seen in Table 10.

Therefore , the latter RCT was analysed separately. There was no statistically significant difference in global assessment when comparing arthroscopic intervention to control (SMD 0.03 , 95% CI [ -0.12 , 0.17], Figure 14; low quality of evidence, Table 13). Heterogeneity was low (I2=0%). The RCT by Vermesa n 2013 reported a statistically significant difference in global assessment favouring intra -articular steroid injection 14). Hamberg 1984 was the only RCT where half of the patients (similar distribution in arthroscopy and in control) were randomised to total meniscectomy . If patients with total meniscectomy were excluded in sensitivity analyses the effect estimate was hardly affected (Figure 38 in section 3.2.4.4.3 ). Two RCT s (Chang 1993, KIVIS) used binary outcome s for global assessment and the results are reported in section 8.4.3.1 of Appendix 5. Seite 85 Figure 14 Global assessment at short -term follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA Three RCT s (FIDELITY, Herrlin 2007, 2013) included patients with DMK only . No RCT included patients with both DMK and OA (mixed), while in five RCT s (Chang 1993, Forster 2003, Hamberg 198 4, Kalunian 2000, \u00d8ster\u00e5s 2012) the population was insufficiently described and the populations in these RCT s were classified as mixed unclear.

There was no statistically significant difference when comparing arthroscopy to non -active treatment (SMD -0.07, 95% CI [95% CI -0.34, 0.18]) . CIs were largely overlapping. Figure 16 shows the resulting forest plot with the two subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate. Seite 87 Figure 16 Global assessment by comparator type at short -term follow -up Global assessment - Intermediate follow -up Global assessment was assessed in 10 RCT s with follow -up times ranging from 12 to 60 months. In e ight of the RCT s the denominator was the number of patients and in two RCT s (Kang 2005, Vermesan 2013 ) the denominator was the number of knees. There was no statistically significant effect on global asse ssments for arthroscopy versus control in RCT s using patients as the denominator (SMD 0.04, 95% CI [ -0.16 , 0.23] , Figure 17; low quality of evidence, Table 14) or in RCT s using the number of knees as the denominator (SMD -0.07 , [ -0.95, 0.81], Figure 17). Heterogeneity between RCT s using patients as the denominator was substantial (I2=39%) and was reduced when r emoving Herrlin 2007 ( I2=12% ) (Figure 39 in ). The results of three RCT s (Biedert 2000, Chang 1993, Merchan 1993) , where pooling was not possible , are presented in section 8.4.3.2 of Appendix 5. Seite 88 Figure 17 Global assessment at intermediate follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA Three RCT s (FIDELITY, Herrlin 2007, 2013) included patients with DMK only . No RCT included a populati on with both DMK and OA (mixed), and in four RCT s (Chang 1993, Forster 2003, Kalunian 2000, Merchan 1993) the population s were insufficiently described and were classified as mixed unclear . Only one RCT (Kirkley 2008) included patients with OA and without concurrent DMK (large meniscus tears were excluded). Effect estimates for global assessment in these subgroups did not statistically significantly differ a nd 95% CIs largely overlapped. The SMDs were -0.11 (95% [ 4]) for patients with mixed OA and DMK of unclear pathology and -0.04 ( 95% CI [ -0.34, 0.26 ]) for patients with OA only .

There was no statistically significant effect in RCT s comparing arthroscopy to no n-active treatment (SMD 0.02, 95% CI [ -0.28, 0.33 ]) or in RCT s comparing arthroscopy treatment ( SMD 0.04 [95% CI -0.21, 0.30 ]).

Seite 90 Figure 19 Global assessment by comparator type at intermediate follow -up 3.2.4.3 Important Outcomes 3.2.4.3.1 Joint stiffness Joint stiffness was measured in three RCT s using the same instrument , but with two different scales .

There was no statistically significant effect on joint stiffness found ( SMD -0.09 , 95% CI [ - 0.45, 0.27 ]), Figure 20; very low quality of evidence, Table 13) in favour of arthroscopy when Seite 91 comparing to c ontrol. Heterogeneity for the pooled estimate from three RCT s was substantial (I2=68 %). In the KIVIS RCT , only mean changes from baseline were reported, and baseline values were slightly imbalanced irrigation, which may account for the heterogeneity seen. Figure 20 Joint stiffness at short -term follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA No RCT included patients with DMK only or patients with both DMK and OA (mixed). In two RCT s (Kalunian 2000, KIVIS 2008) the population s were insufficiently described and the patient populations of these RCT s were classified as mixed unclear. Only one RCT (Kirkley 2008) included patients with OA without concurrent DMK (large meniscus tears were excluded ). Effect estimates for joint stiffness in these subgroups did not statistically significantly differ and 95% CIs largely overlapped. The SMDs were -0.18 (95% for patients with OA and DMK unclear pathology and 0.08 (95% CI [ -0.23, 0.39 ]) for patients with OA only . Figure 21 shows the resulting forest plot with the subg roup estimates and overall effect estimate. Seite 92 Figure 21 Joint stiffness by DMK/OA classification at short -term follow -up Subgroups: non -active versus active In two RCT s (Kalunian 2000, Kirkley 2008) arthroscopic surgery was compared non -active comparators and in one RCT (KIVIS ) with an active comparator. There was no statistically significant effect in the two RCT s comparing arthroscopy to 95% CI [-0.16, 0.34]), but a statistically significant effect estimate was in the one RCT found favouring arthroscopy when compared RCT only mean changes from baseline were reported, and the baseline values were slightly imbalanced (arthroscopic tidal irrigation: 123\u00b138 versus corticosteroid injection: 112\u00b144) favouring tidal irrigation. CIs were largely overlapping. Figure 22 shows the resulting forest plot with the two subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate. Seite 93 Figure 22 Joint stiffness by comparator type at short -term follow -up Joint stiffness - Intermediate follow -up Joint stiffness was assessed by two RCTs , one at 12 months (Kalunian 2000) and the other at 24 months (Kirkley 2008) . Compared to control, arthroscopy was found to have no stati stically significant effect on joint CI [ -0.75, 0.39 ], 23; very low quality of evidence, Table 14). Heterogeneity was substantial (I2=79%). Heterogeneity could not be explained as only two RCTs reported joint stiffness at intermediate follow -up. Figure 23 Joint stiffness at intermediate follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA No subgroup analyses were conducted as only two RCT s reported results for joint stiffness at intermediate follow -up. One RCT (Kalunian 2000) included a population that could not be classified and Kirkley 2008 included patients only with OA without concurre nt DMK . Subgroups: non -active arthroscopy to no n-active treatment; hence , no subgroup analyses were conducted . Seite 94 3.2.4.3.2 Total knee replacem ent Total knee replacement (TKR) at 12 months was reported in two RCT s (Forster 2003, MeTeOR). The point estimate indicate d a higher relative risk for total knee replacement in the arthroscopic group compared to controls, but this estimate was no t statistically significant (RR 1.25 , 95% CI [0.38, 4.19], Figure 24; very low quality of evidence, Table 14). Heterogeneity for this outcome was low (I2=0%).

Compared to control, there was no statistically significant effect on both health -related and disease -specific qualit y of life) in favour of arthroscopy compared to control (SMD respectively, 25; very low qualities of evidence, Table 13). Heterogeneity was low (I2=0%) for both outcomes. Kise 2016 reported a between -group , the RCT could not be pooled with results from the other RCT s. Figure 25 Quality of life at short -term follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA No subgroup analyses were conducted as too few RCT s reported results for health -related or disease -specific qualit y of life. Two RCTs (Gauffin 2014, Herrlin 2007) reported a population of DMK only. The other RCT (Kirkley 2008) included patients with OA only without concurrent DMK . Subgroups: non -active versus active Seite 96 No subgroup analyses were conducted as too few RCTs reported results for health -related or disease -specific qualit y of life. All three RCTs (Gauffin 2014, Herrlin 2007, Kirkley 2 008) compared arthroscopy to non -active treatment . Quality of life - Intermediate follow -up Five RCT s reported on quality of life with follow -up time s ranging from 12 to 60 months. Three RCT s (FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014, Kirkley 2008) assess ed health -related and disease -specific qualit y of life, and one RCT (Herrlin 2007) assessed only disease -specific quality of life. Compared to control, arthroscopy did n ot have a statistically significant effect on health -related and disease - specific qualit y of life ( moderate qualit ies of evidence, Table 14). Heterogeneity was low (I2=0%) for both outcomes . The RCT by Kise 2016 reported a between favouring arthroscopy and could not be pooled with results from the other RCT s. Figure 26 Quality of life at intermediate follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA Two RCT s (FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014) reported on health -related quality of life in patients with DMK only, and one RCT (Kirkley 2008) in patients with OA only with out concurrent DMK (large meniscus tears were excluded). Effect estimates for health -related quality of life in these subgroups did not statistically significantly differ and 95% CIs largely overlapped. The SMD s were 0.24, 95% CI [ -0.00, 0.49 ] for patients with DMK only and 0.06, 95% CI [ -0.24, 0.36] for patients with OA only. Figure 27 shows the resulting forest plot with the two subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate.

RCT s reported number of patients with adverse events without subsequent surger y, or counted subsequent surger y as AE s, or only reported patients with subsequent surger y. Patients with a dverse events combined with subsequent surger y were reported in three RCT s (Biedert 2000, FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014) ; four RCT s (FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014, Kise 2016, MeTeOR) reported patients with adverse events without subsequent surger y. There was no statistical difference between arthroscopy and comparator for adverse events combined with subsequent surger y (RR 0.41, 95% CI [0.08, 2.17] , Figure 29, very low quality of evidence, Table 14). Heterogeneity was considerable (I2=75%) and could not be explained by sensitivity analyses as there were too few RCT s. There was no statistical difference between arthroscopy and comparator for adverse events with out subsequent surgery (RR 1.07 , 95% CI [0.67, 1.70], Figure 30; low quality of evidence, Table 14). Heterogeneity was low (I2=0%). Patients with s ubsequent surger y were reported in six RCT s (Biedert 2000, FIDELITY, Forster 2003, Gauffin 2014, Herrlin 2007, Kise 2016). The relative risk of subsequent surgery for arthroscopy versus control was 0.24 (95% CI [0.14, 0.44 ], Figure 31; low quality of evidence, Table 14). (This is explained by a high cross -over rate or patients in control groups who were more Seite 99 likely to undergo subsequent surgery , RR 4.14 95% CI [2.27, 7.14] outcome low (I2=0%). Eleven RCT s reported on cross -overs; an overview of reported cross - over s is presented in section 8.4.4 of Appendix 5. Two RCT s reported the number of patients with side effects that occurred within two weeks (KIVIS) and five days (Saeed 2015) after arthroscopy and were not pooled in analyses. The KIVIS RCT reported knee swelling in four patients (5.6%) in the arthroscopy group and in four patients (5.1%) in the comparator group . No other AE s were reported . Saeed 2015 reported pain and mild effusion in 13 patients (21.7%) in the arthroscopy group and pain at injection site in eight patients (13.3%) in the comparator group. Figure 29 Adverse events combined with subsequent surger y at intermediate follow -up Figure 30 Adverse events without subsequent surger y at intermediate follow -up Seite 100 Figure 31 Subsequent surger y at intermediate follow -up Subgroups: DMK versus OA Subgroup analyses were not conducted for patients with adverse events combined with subsequent or without surgeries as there were too few RCT s reporting results. For patients with subsequent surgery at intermediate follow -up, four RCT s (FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014, Herrlin 2007, Kise 2016) included patients with DMK only, and in two RCT s (Biedert 2000, Forster 2003) the population was insufficiently described and the populations in these RCT s were classified as mixed unclear. Relative risk s for subsequent surgery for arthroscopy versus control were 0.22 (95% CI [0.11, 0.42]) for the DMK on ly group and 0.39 (95% CI [0.11, 1.40]) for patients with mixed OA and DMK of unclear pathology. Relative risks for subsequent surgery in these subgroups did not statistically significantly differ and 95% CIs were largely overlapping. Figure 32 shows the resulting forest plot with the four subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate. Seite 101 Figure 32 Subsequent surger y by DMK/OA classification at intermediate follow -up Subgroups: non -active versus active Subgroup analyse s were not conducted for patients with adverse events combined with subsequent or without surger y as there were too few RCT s reporting results. For patients with subsequent surger y at intermediate follow -up, three RCT s (FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014, Herrlin 2007 ) compared arthroscopic to non -active comparators, and three RCT s (Biedert 2000, Forster 2003, Kise 2016 ) to active comparators. The relative risk of subsequent surgery of arthroscopy compared to non -active treatment was 0.21 ( 95% CI [0.09, 0.46 ]) and the relative risk of subsequent surgery of arthroscopy compared to active treatment was 0.30 ( 95% CI [0.13, 0.72 ]). Relative risks for subsequent surgery in these subgroups did not statistically significantly differ and 95% CIs were largely overlapping. Figure 33 shows the resulting forest plot with the two subgroup estimates and overall effect estimate.

The relative risk for SAEs of arthroscopy versus control 1.83 (95% CI [0. 39, 8.62] , Figure 34; very low quality of evidence, Table 14). Heterogeneity for this outcome was low (I2=0%). Figure 34 Serious adverse events at intermediate follow -up Seite 103 Mortality Five RCT s (Gauffin 2014, Kise 2016 MeTeOR, Merchan 1993, Moseley 2002) reported on mortality. Gauffin 2014 reported on e death at 36 months (1.3%) in the arthroscopy group and MeTeOR reported one death at 12 months (0.6%) each from the arthroscopy and comparator groups, Merchan 1993 reported five deaths (12.5%) in the arthroscopy group and two deaths (5%) in the comparator group. Kise 2015 reported no serious adverse events (including deaths) at 24 months and Moseley repor ted no post -operative deaths. Of the RCTs reporting death, no information was given on if deaths occurred within 30 days of intervention. Subgroups: DMK versus OA Too few RCTs reported on serious adverse events to conduct subgroup analyses. Subgroups: no n-active versus active Too few RCTs reported on serious adverse events to conduct subgroup analyses. 3.2.4.4 Sensitivity analyses Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding RCT s with extreme or opposite treatment effects. 3.2.4.4.1 Pain At short -term follow -up, results for the outcome of pain were pooled across 13 RCT s. Excluding Kalunian 2000 from this analysis reduced the heterogeneity from I2=44% to I2=12% with an estimate d effect of SMD -0.22 (95% CI [ -0.34, -0.10] , was the only RCT comparing arthroscopic lavage (irrigation of knee joint with 3 ,000 ml of saline) to diagnostic arthroscopy (irrigation of knee joint with 250 ml of saline). At 3 month follow -up, a statistically significant effect (SMD 0.44, 95% CI [0.02, 0.86], Figure 2) was found in favour of diagnostic arthroscopy wherea s at was 12 months follow -up a statistically significant effect (SMD -0.59, 95% CI [-1.02, -0.17 , Figure of arthroscop ic lavage was found. Seite 104 Figure 35 Pain at short -term follow -up, sensitivity analysis 3.2.4.4.2 Function At short -term follow -up, results for the outcome of function were pooled across nine RCT s. Excluding Forster 2003 from this analysis reduced the heterogeneity from I2=50% to I2=36% with an estimated effect size of SMD -0.13, (95% CI [ -0.28, 0.03 ], Figure 36). At intermediate follow -up, results from eight RCT s were pooled. Although heterogeneity was low (I2=0%), to ensure that unequal baseline measures in the RCT by Forster 2003 did not affect the overall effect estimate , a sensitivity analysis was conducted . Excl uding Forster 2003 from the analyses did not affect heterogeneity and only resulted in a slight change in the overall effect estimate (SMD -0.08, 95% CI [ -0.21, 0.04], Figure 37). Seite 105 Figure 36 Function at short -term follow -up, sensitivity analysis Figure 37 Function at intermediate follow -up, sensitivity analysis 3.2.4.4.3 Global assessment Results of nine RCT s reporting on global assessment of patients were pooled at short -term follow - up. In the RCT by Hamberg 1984, results were presented for four g roups: arthroscopic partial meni scectomy, arthroscopic total meniscectomy, open partial meniscectomy and open total meniscectomy; it was decided to combine results of both arthroscopic groups and both open surgery groups for the purpose of these analyses. To ensure heterogeneity and the overall effect estimate remained unchanged, a sensitivity analysis was performed re placing the combi ned arthroscopic and open surgery results with results comparing the arthroscopic partial meniscectomy group to the open partial meniscectomy group. When excluding patients with total meniscectomy , I2 estimates for heterogeneity were unaff ected and only slightly changed the overall effect estimat e (SMD 0.03 95% CI [ -0.12, 0.18] , Figure 38). Eight RCT s reported on global assessment in patients with intermediate follow -up. Excluding the RCT by Herrlin 2007 - the only RCT that had a statistically significant effect on global assessment in favour of comparator (SMD 0.46 [95% CI [0.04, 0.87], Figure 17) - from this analysis reduced Seite 106 the heterogeneity from I2=39% to I2=12%; however, the effect estimate only changed slightly (SMD -0.03, 95% CI [ -0.20, 0.14], Figure 39).

Compared to control, arthroscopy had a statistically significant effect on pain (SMD -0.16, 95% CI [ -0.31, - 0.01], Figure 2; low quality of evidence, Table 13). Nine RCTs including 1,172 patient s reported on the outcome of function and found no statistically significant effect (SMD -0.08, 95% CI [ -0.26, 0.09], Figure 8; very low quality of evidence, Table 13). Nine RCTs that included 717 patients found no statistically significant difference in global assessment results, when comparing arthroscop y to control (SMD 0.03, 95% CI [ -0.12, 0.17], Figure 14; low quality of evidence, Table 13). A total of 389 patients in three RCTs found no statistically significant effect on joint stiffness (SMD -0.09, 95% CI [ -0.45, 0.27]), Figure 20; very low quality of evidence, Table 13) in favour of arthroscopy compar ed to control. Two RCT s with 282 patients found no statistically significant effect on health -related quality of life in favour of arthroscopy compared to control (SMD 0.18, Seite 108 95% CI [ -0.05, 0.42], Figure 25; very low quality of evidence, Table 13). Additionally, there was no statistically significant effect found in three RCT s with 375 patients on disease -specific quality of life in favour of arthroscopy compared to control (SMD 0. 18, 95% CI [ -0.02, 0.39 ], Figure 25; very low quality of evidence, Table 13). The overall quality of evidence was judged to be very low because of the very low quality of evidence for the critical outcome of function at short -term follow -up. 3.2.4.5.2 Intermediate follow -up (latest point after six months and up to seven years) Knee pain at intermediate follow -up was reported for a total of 1 ,274 pa tients in 10 RCTs . Compared to control, arthroscopy did not have a statistically significant , beneficial effect on reducing pain (SMD -0.11, 95% CI [ -0.22, 0.00], Figure 5; low of evidence, Table 14). Eight RCTs includ ing 1,024 patients reported on the outcome of function, and found no statistically significant effect (SMD -0.06, 95% CI [ -0.18, 0.07], Figure 11; low quality of evidence, Table 14) in favour of arthroscopy compared to control. Eight RCTs that included 735 patients found no statistically significant effect on global assessment result s for arthroscopy versus control (SMD 0.04, 95% CI [ -0.16, 0.23], Figure 17; low quality of evidence, Table 14). A total of 258 patients in two RCTs found no statistically significant effect on joint stiffness (SMD -0.18, 95% CI [ -0.75, 0.39], Figure 23; very low quality of evidence, Table 14) in favour of arthroscopy compared to control. Two RC Ts reporting on 383 patients indicate d a higher relative risk for total knee replacement in the arthroscop y group compared to controls, but this estimate was not statistically significant (RR 1.25, 95% CI [0.38, 4.19], Figure 24; very low quality of evidence, Table 14). There was no statistically significant effect in three RCT s with 428 patients on health -related quality of life in favour of arthroscopy compared to control (SMD 0.17, 95% CI [ -0.02, 0.36], Figure 26; moderate quality of evidence, Table 14). In addition, there was no statistically significant effect found in four RCT s with 525 patients on disease -specific quality of life in favour of arthroscopy compared to control (SMD 0.17, 95% CI [ -0.02, 0.36], Figure 26; moderate quality of evidence, Table 14). Three RCTs with 336 patients report ed on AEs combined with subsequent surgery; there was no statistically significant difference in AE occurrence combined with subsequent surgery in favour of arthroscopy compared to control (RR 0.41, 95% CI [0.08, 2.17], Figure 29, very low quality of evidence, Table 14). There was no statistically significant difference in AE occurrence without subsequent surgery in four RCT s with 787 patients (RR 1.07, 95% CI [0.67, 1.70], Figure 30; low quality of evidence, Table 14). A total of six RCTs with 586 pa tients found that the relative risk of subsequent surgery for arthroscopy versus control was 0.24 (95% CI [0.14, 0.44], Figure 31; low quality of evidence, Table 14). Four RCTs with 757 patients reported on SAEs; there was no statistically significant difference in SAE occurrence in favour of arthroscopy compared to control (RR 1.83, (95% CI [0.39, 8.62]), Figure 34; very low quality of evidence, Table 14). The overall quality of evidence was judged to be low because of the low quality of evidence for the critical outcome s of pain, function and global assessment at intermediate follow -up.

The mean pain score after discharge for 45 patients in the short -stay group (inpatient) was 3.4 (SD 2.7), while the mean pain score after discharge for the day -case group (outpatients ) was 3.5 (SD 2.6). However, the analgesics use and days off work were longer in the short -stay (3.2 days \u00b1 4.9 and 19.4 days \u00b110.6, respectively) than in the d ay-case group (2.6 days \u00b1 3.8 and 11.6 days \u00b1 16.9). The authors found no statistically significant difference between the two groups for all endpoints . Three participants (6%) crossed - over from the short -stay group and discharged themselves on day of surg ery, while six participants (12%) crossed -over from the day -case group and were admitted overnight. One patient in the short -stay group required readmission to the hospital due to a wound haematoma. 3.2.5.3 Subgroups None. 3.2.5.4 Summary of results Because only one RCT was found, the quality of evidence was not assessed using GRADE. The overall quality of evidence was judged to be very low because RCT data comparing inpatient arthroscopic treatment to outpatient arthroscopic treatment were essentiall y absent . Seite 118 4 Cost -effectiveness and budget impact 4.1 Methods The economic section of this HTA report consists of two main parts . The first part aims at gain ing an understanding of the cost -effectiveness of therapeutic knee arthroscopy compared to any other treatment in patients with de generative changes of the knee - irrespective of whether they are primarily due to meniscal damage, osteoarthritis of the knee or a mix of both and, to the extent possible, of the cost -effectiv eness of inpatient compared to outpatient therapeutic knee arthroscopy in this patient population. Health economic endpoints considered included costs, QALYs, and incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (i.e. additional cost per life year gained or QALY gaine d). The perspectives of interest were the 'KVG perspective' (third party perspective, taking into account the direct medical costs of all healthcare services covered by the Swiss statutory health insurance, irrespective of actual payer) and the societal pe rspective. The assessment was based on national and international health economic literature , to the extent available. The analysis included the following steps, which are detailed in subsequent sections. Literature search Screening of the search results to identify eligible studies and of studies Extraction of information and assessment of the quality of reporting in eligible cost - effectiveness studies Assessment of the eligible cost -effectiveness studies in terms of transf erability to Switzerland For the studies found to be qualitatively transferable, adaptation of cost -effec tiveness results to Switzerland Synopsis of findings The second part of the economic section aims at estimat ing the budget impact of meniscus derangeme nt in the Swiss healthcare system from a health insurance system (KVG) perspective. Following decisions taken during the scoping process, the patient population of primary interest in the clinical and cost -effectiveness parts of this HTA (degenerative chan ges of the knee primarily due to meniscal damage) differs slightly from that used in the budget impact part (any degenerative changes of the knee). 4.1.1 Cost -effectiveness 4.1.1.1 Literature search The aim of the literature search was to identify literature on the costs and cost -effectiveness of knee arthroscopy compared to other interventions or conservative treatment , for patients with Seite 119 degenerative changes of the knee . All types of economic evaluat ion studies were considered and checked for relevant content: cost -effectiveness -, cost -benefit -, cost -utility - and cost -minimization analyses. A search strategy was developed to identify all relevant literature in the following electronic databases: Medl ine and Embase databases including abstracts by using OvidSP (including Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In -Process & Other Non -Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily Update, Embase), the Cochrane Library and the Centre for Review and Dissemination (CRD) database including the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane reviews, Health Technology Assessments (HTA) and the Economic Evaluation Database from the UK National Health Service (NHS EED). Search strings for additional databases we re not developed because the selection of databases aforementioned has been described as both sufficient and very efficient.67 The search strings were obtained by integrating and combin ing the search strings used in the clinical effectiveness part of this HTA report and published search strings for health economic analyses from the InterTASC Information Specialists' SubGroup (ISSG) website (www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/intertasc). The f ollowi ng filters, described as highly sensitive in Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE, were included: The National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) filter, the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland filter and the Royle filter published in 2003 .67 68 Additional filters such as the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Net work (SIGN) filter (http://www.sign.ac.uk/methodology/filters.html), the McKinlay et al.69 filter, the Wilczynski et al.70 filter and the Sassi et al.71 filter were also included. Unspecific abbreviations such as CUA or CBA were not us ed. The search strategy and MeSH terms used for each database are described in the search strategy reported in Appendix C , section 9.1 Literature search strategy . The search was performed on 11th July 2017. 4.1.1.2 Screening of the search results The screening of the literature was divided in to three phases. In the first phase, all results of the literature search were screened by title. Titles containing relevant keywords such as knee arthroscopy, knee surgery, costs, value, cost -effectiveness, cost -benefit, cost -utility, quality of life, and b urden were considered as potentially relevant. All papers with potentially relevant titles then proceeded to the second phase, the screening by abstract. In this phase, abstracts were screened for relevant quantitative results (e.g. costs, life year gained , QALYs, or ICERs) or for sentences suggesting potentially relevant content in the full text version. Potentially relevant abstracts proceeded to the third phase, in which full texts were screened. Articles were then classified as being relevant, partially relevant, or irrelevant. Relevant articles needed to meet the following criteria: o The article reported a full -scale incremental cost -effectiveness analysis, ideally but not necessarily with an endpoint of cost per QALY gained or cost per life year gained. o The 'PIC' of the PICO corresponded to the one defined in the scoping document and used in the systematic review part of this HTA report. Seite 120 o The analysis was performed for a jurisdiction with broadly similar socioeconomic characteristics as Switzerland (e.g. North, Central and Western European countries, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand). Partially relevant articles were defined as those potentially containing useful additional information concerning effectiveness or costs (but not both) . Depending o n the quality and quantity of information available from relevant articles, some partially relevant articles were used as an additional source of information and for comparison. The remainder of articles were classified as irrelevant. 4.1.1.3 Extraction of inform ation For the eligible cost -effectiveness studies (i.e. relevant articles as defined above), data extraction was performed, covering the following information: Study population (including country, age of patients) Intervention Comparator(s) Setting and perspective of the study Cost types included and cost year Type of model Time horizon Discount rate Approach to sensitivity analysis Effectiveness Costs Incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) A brief, qualitative characterization of each study was prepared in the results section, covering methodological approaches taken, main data sources, methodological issues and potential meaningfulness of the results for Switzerland. Quality of reporting was assessed against the Consolidated Health Economic Eval uation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 24 -item checklist, recommended by the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task Force.72 . The complete CHEERS checklist is reported in the Appendix (section 9.2). Articles were considered of good, average, or p oor quality if they addressed respectively more than 80%, between 60% and 80%, or less than 60% of the CHEERS checklist items. 4.1.1.4 Assessment of transferability International cost -effectiveness studies were assessed for 'qualitative transferab ility' to Switzerland. A variety of authors have worked on criteria for assessing such transferability between jurisdictions.73 Methodologic papers publish ed early by O'Brien et al.74, Welte at al.75, and Drummond et al.76 suggested the use of multistep proced ures. In the present study, a modified approach as described below and summarised schematically in Figure 40 was adopted . One key reason for using this modified approach is that none of the original models un derlying the eligible Seite 121 cost -effectiveness studies were available. Therefore, actual model recalculations on the basis of localized input parameters, such as e.g. unit costs, were not possible. The most important criteria for qualitative transferability were already covered by the eligibility criteria. Essentially, the assessment of eligibility excluded studies that were not full-scale health economic evaluation studies assessing incremental cost -effectiveness, did not mee t the 'PIC', or were performed for countries very different from Switzerland in terms of socioeconomic characteristics. All remaining studies were thus expected to meet CHEERS criteria 4 (population) , 7 (intervention / comparator[s]) and 10 (outcome measur es). Studies not meeting CHEERS items 5, 6, 8, 13, 14 and 19 were regarded as not transferable due to lack of key information. In relation to item 19, the availability of costs and outcomes of interest for both the intervention and the comparator strategie s was considered fundamental. Where articles only reported ICERs, the underlying study was considered non -transferable (see Figure 40). The remaining s tudies were considered qualitatively transferable, and underwent numerical adaptation of cost -effectiveness results to Switzerland (see next section) , if scrutiny of additional transferability factors taken from O'Brien et al. 74 and Welte et al. 75 did not preclude this for a specific reason. In all other case s, the results of the scrutiny of transferability factors were used qualitatively. The following additional transferability factors were considered: Methodological characteristics: o Perspective of cost assessment o Discount rate o Medical cost approach o Productivity cost approach Healthcare system characteristics: o Absolute and relative prices in healthcare o Clinical practice variation; differences in resource use, incentives and regulations for health -care providers o Technology availability Population characteristics: o Demography o Disease incidence and prevalence o Case -mix o Life expectancy o Health -status preferences o Acceptance, compliance, incentives to the patients o Productivity and work -loss time For most cost -effectiveness studies meeting the g eneral eligibility criteria , severe transferability problems were not expected since methodological and population characteristic were expected to be similar to Switzerland. Regarding healthcare system characteristics, large differences in availability of technology were not expected . Costs of healthcare services were adapted numerically (see section 4.2.1.2 ). Studies falling in the lower left box of Figure 40 were regarded as being qualitatively transferable. Seite 122 Criterion 5: State relevant aspects of the system(s) in which the decision(s) need(s) to be made. Criterion 6: Describe the perspective of the study and relate this to the costs being evaluated. Criterion 8: State the time horizon(s) over which costs and consequences are being evaluated and say why appropriate. Criterion 13: Model -based economic evaluation: Describe approaches and data sources used to estimate resource use associated with model health states. Describe primary or secondary research methods for valuing each resource item in terms of its unit cost. Describe any adjustments made to approximate t o opportunity costs. Criterion 14: Report the dates of the estimated resource quantities and unit costs. Describe methods for adjusting estimated unit costs to the year of reported costs if necessary. Describe methods for converting costs into a common cur rency base and the exchange rate. Criterion 19: For each intervention, report mean values for the main categories of estimated costs and outcomes of interest, as well as mean differences between the comparator groups. If applicable, report incremental cost -effectiveness ratios. Figure 40 Steps for study selection and determination of transferability to Switzerland 4.1.1.5 Adaptation of cost -effectiveness results to Switzerland The adaptation of direct medical cost result s to Switzerland was performed in three distinct steps (Figure 41): correction for different levels of resource utilization, correction for different prices of healthcare services, and correction for change in level of resource utilization and prices over time. Subsequently, adapted ICERs were calculated dividing adapted cost differences by originally reported QALY differences. This process was used in a previous HTA report for the SMB77 and was described in a recent publication.78 It cannot be interpreted as achieving realistic ICERs for Switzerland, but a certain approximation of cost -effectiveness levels to be expected for General eligibility criteria met (i.e., incremental cost -effectiveness study meeting the 'PIC' and performed for a suitable country)? If YES : CHEERS criteria 5, 6, 8, 13, 14, 19 met and assessment of additional transferability criteria does not lead to exclusion for a specific reason? If NO: Potentially containing useful additional information? If YES : Adapt cost - effectiveness results numerically If NO: Interpret study and consider qualitatively If YES : Use eventually as auxiliary information If NO: Exclude Seite 123 Switzerland. The results of international cost -effectiveness studies, reported for different countrie s and in different currencies, were made more comparable. 1. Resource utilization: The types and quantities of healthcare resources used differ between countries. For the same disease, patients in Switzerland often receive more medical treatments than in othe r countries (i.e. they are treated more intensively for an equivalent diagnosis). Therefore, a \"quantity correction\" is necessary. The quantity correction was based on the Organization for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) statistics of healthca re expenses per capita, corrected for purchasing power.79 A correction for differences in resource utilization levels (unaffected by price levels) was thus achieved. 2. Prices of healthcare services: The price for the same healthcare service or treatment is often different across countries. A \"price correction\" wa s achieved by applying correction factors provided by the OECD. Such purchasing power parities represent the proportional costs for identical products in two countries.79 3. Change in costs over time: Healthcare costs change over time. For eligible cost - effectiveness studies performed in countries other than Switzerland, the two steps described above achieve an adaptation of reported costs. However, the resulting estimates are valid for the same cost year as in the original study. Additional correction for the development of costs over time was necessary. In the case of a specific disease and set of treatment str ategies, costs may change over time due to mere price changes without changes in resource utilization, or resource utilization for the treatment of the disease of interest may also change. In our 'base case' approach, the latter was assumed, and that chang es in resource utilization occur with the same cost impact as at the level of total Swiss healthcare expenditures. The resulting correction was based on the yearly growth rates of total Swiss healthcare expenditures, as reported by the Swiss Federal Office of Statistics.80 The adaptation of cost data representing indirect costs followed a simila r approach. However, the first of the above -described steps is irrelevant in the case of indirect costs. The third step was based on the change in Swiss salaries over time.81 Figure 41 Adaptation of direct medical cost results to Switzerland 4.1.1.6 Synthesis of findings The resulting different pieces of information were synthesized. This necessarily involved an element of interpretation, but it was an explicit aim to make all related assumptions transparent. The d iscussion includes a critical review of possible sources of uncertainty. Comparisons of the assumptions and of the data used by the various cost -effectiveness analyses were provided. Step 1: C orrection for different levels of resource utilization Step 2: Correction for different prices of healthcare services Step 3: C hange in level of resource utilization and prices over time Seite 124 4.1.2 Budget impact analyses The aim of the budget impact analysis was to estimate the budget impact of meniscus derangement in the Swiss healthcare system , from a health insurance system (KVG ) perspective. The analysis consisted of two main steps: first, the annual frequency of knee arthroscopy in Switzerland was investigated; second, based on annual frequency , the total annual costs were estimated. As specified in the scoping, the budget impact analysis was focused on arthroscopic meniscectomy and associated minor arthroscopic interventions for degenerative changes in the knee joint. For this reason, cases that were reimbursed by the accid ent insurance (i.e. patients with traumatic knee injuries) were excluded from the cost estimations. It should be emphasized that patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee (ICD -10 code M17.xx) were not included in the budget impact assessment because the preliminary analysis showed that this code was mainly used in combination with knee replacement, whereas the combination with arthroscopy or knee derangement occurred rare ly. More in detail, in 2014 there were 25,454 hospitalisations receiving an ICD-10 co de of M17 as main diagnosis. Of these cases, only 250 were classified with one of the selected SwissDRG codes. The majority was in contrast classified with SwissDRG I43B: Knee replacement implants. This decision not to include ICD -10 code of M17 was done i n agreement with the SFOPH. To assess the frequency arthroscopic knee interventions in the inpatient setting in Switzerland, the Swiss Hospital Statistics of the years 2010 to 2014 provided by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office were analysed. The Swiss H ospital Statistics is a collection of data on all patients that were hospitalized in a Swiss hospital during a specific year. This included a total of 1,345,245 hospitalisations in 2010, 1,363,697 in 2011, 1,353,521 in 2012, 1,374,439 in 2013, and 1,400,83 0 in 2014. The collected information included patient characteristics, diagnoses, and performed interventions. As already noticed during the scoping process conducted on behalf of the SFOPH , patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery may be identified t hrough three different types of variables reported in the Swiss Hospital Statistics: Swiss DRG and All Patients Diagnosis -Related Groups (APDRG) codes indicating the main hospitalisation reason for each patient, ICD-10 codes indicating the main diagnosis and secondary diagnoses for meniscus derangement, or Swiss classification of the surgical interventions ( CHOP ) codes indicating which knee arthroscopic treatments were performed. The Swiss Hospital Statistics only include s patients who were hospitalized (i.e. outpatients were excluded) . The f requency of knee arthroscopy in the ambulatory setting , including outpatients who were treated in a hospital, was based on an analysis of medical tariff ( TARMED ) codes provided by the SFOPH. This analysis provided information about the total number of knee arthroscopies and concomitant arthroscopic knee interventions in the ambulant setting in 2013 and 2014. Other information (e.g. concerning patient characteristic s and underlying diagnosis were not availa ble. Nevertheless, the identified TARMED codes allowed a rough estimation of the annual number of ambulant arthroscopic interventions to the meniscus. Seite 125 To assess costs, data from the diagnosis -related case costs statistics (Statistik diagnosebezogener Fallkosten) provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Statistics, as well as cost estimations of a Swiss insurance company were used. Mean costs per case were applied to the frequency of arthroscopic knee interventions to estimate the annua l budget impact. 4.1.2.1 Swiss DRG codes / APDRG codes The diagnosis -related group (DRG) is a system to classify hospital cases , as a basis for reimbursement . Every inpatient case receives one single DRG classification code. The Swiss DRG system (www. swissdrg.org) was introduced country -wide in January 2012 and is based on the German DRG (www.g -drg.de) . The DRG code is assigned according to patient characteristics, ICD- 10 diagnoses and the treatments provided to the patients (CHOP codes , www.medcode.ch ). In particular, the main diagnosis and the main treatment play a fundamental role, as they are the main driver s of the classification. Thus, depending on how coders in hospitals code the diagnoses and treatments of cases (i.e. depending on their sequence) , patients with similar diagnoses and treatments may be assigned to different Swiss DRG codes . For this analysis , six Swiss DRG codes suggesting potentially relevant knee interventions were identified during the scoping process : - I04Z: Revision or replacement of the knee with complicating diagnose or arthrodesis - I23B: Infection/Inflammation of Bone and Joint W Misc or Mod CC - I18A: Arthroscopy, incl. Biopsy or other interventions on bone or joints, age < 16 years - I18B: Arthroscopy, incl. Biopsy or other interventions on bone or joints, age > 15 years - I30Z: Complex knee interventions - I59Z: Other interventions on Humerus, Tibia, Fibula, ankle joint or relatively complex interventions on knee joint, elbo w joint and forearm The Swiss DRG codes were available in the Swiss Hospital Statistics 2012 to 2014. For patients hospitalized before 2012, only the APDRG codes were available. Unfortunately, these older codes and the actual Swiss DRG codes were only partially comparable. For the present analyses , following APDRG codes that may be related to knee interventions were identified : - 221: Synovectomy and ligament reconstruction at the knee, with KK - 222: Synovectomy and ligament reconstruction at the knee, withou t KK - 232: Arthroscopy - 917: Other knee surgeries, with KK - 918: Other knee surgeries, without KK - 1222: Synovectomy and ligament reconstruction at the knee, without KK, with multiple interventions - 1232: Arthroscopy, with multiple interventions The APDRG codes were available for the Swiss Hospital Statistics 2010 and 2011. It should be emphasized that some Swiss DRG codes (I23B, I18A, I18B, and I59Z) and APDRG codes (232, 1232) potentially included intervention s at other joints. Moreover, the Swiss DRG code I30Z as well as the APDRG codes 917 and 918 may have include d non -arthroscopic Seite 126 interventions. Therefore, to correctly identify patients with knee problems it was necessary to combine the Swiss DRG codes with the ICD-10 and CHOP codes. 4.1.2.2 ICD-10 codes The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is a health care classification system providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases. The ICD is internationally recognised as a standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology , health management and clinical purposes, is revised periodically, and is currently in its tenth revision (ICD -10, www.who.int/classifications/icd/). For this analysis , the scoping process identified five ICD -10 codes suggesting a relevant diagnosis for kne e/meniscus derangement: - M23.2: Derangement of meniscus due or injury - M23.3: Other meniscus derangements - M23.8: Other internal derangements of knee - M23.9: Internal derangement of knee, unspecified - S83.2: Tear of meniscus, current injury It is important to remark that a patient may have multiple concurrent diagnoses. For this reason, in the Swiss Hospital Statistics a patient can receive simultaneous ly one main diagnosis (\"Hauptdiagnose\") and several secondary diagnoses (\"Nebendiagnosen\"). Depending on the severity of the diseases, hospital coders will decide which is the principal reason for the hospitalization (the main diagnosis) and which ones are secondary problems (secondary diagnoses). For example, a person involved in a car accident may arrive at the hospital with a cranial fracture and a derangement of the knee. In this case, the cranial fracture would probably be the main diagnosis, whereas t he knee derangement would be a secondary diagnosis. For the present assessment the main diagnosis and up to 10 secondary diagnoses were considered per patient. All diagnoses were considered equally, independent of the sequence. The total number of relevan t diagnoses did not directly reflect the total number of hospitalized patients because many patients received more than one single, relevant diagnosis (e.g. several patients had different M23.2 codes like \"M23.21 - Derangement of anterior horn of medial meniscus due to old tear or injury\" and \"M23.22 - Derangement of posterior horn of medial meniscus due to old tear or injury\"). For the cost calculation, all cases with at least one relevant ICD-10 code were considered equally important (i.e. case s with only one relevant diagnosis were considered like those with multiple relevant ICD -10 codes) . 4.1.2.3 CHOP codes CHOP is the Swiss classification of surgical interventions (www.medcode.ch) . The f ollowing potentially relevant codes were available from the Swiss Hospital Statistics 2011 -2014: - 80.16.10: Arthroskopisch e Arthrotomie - Sonstige In the year 2010, Swiss Hospital Statistics merged several relevant CHOP codes. The f ollowing potentially relevant groups of CHOP codes were identified for this year : - 80.16: Sonstige Arthrotomie des 81.99.82 4.1.2.4 Patient identification in the Swiss Hospital Statistics Patients with relevant knee problems, diagnoses, or treatments were identified through DRG codes, ICD -10 codes, or CHOP codes. The results of the scoping process have shown that relevant DRG codes, relevant ICD-10 codes, and relevant CHOP -codes only partially overlap. For example, not all patients classified under a relevant DRG code received a relevant diagnosis (ICD -10 code) Seite 128 or an arthroscopic intervention of the knee (CHOP code) . Similarly, not all patients who received some relevant diagnoses (ICD -10 code s) or relevant arthroscopic treatments (CHOP -codes) were classified with one of the DRG codes mentioned above. For this budget impact analysis, two analytical strategies were used: in the first strategy , only patients who reported at the same time a relevant DRG code, at least one relevant diagnosis (ICD - 10 code), and at least one relevant treatment (CHOP code) were included. In the second strategy , all patients who had at the same time at least one relevant diagnosis (ICD -10 code) and one relevant treatment (CHOP code), irrespective of the reported DRG codes, were included. 4.1.2.5 TARMED codes The TARMED (Tarif M\u00e9dic al) is a standardized tariff system for outpatient medical services launched the first of January 2004. It encompasses about 4,000 tariff positions, which label and assess services provided by do ctors (www.fmh.ch/ambulante_tarife/tarmed -tarif.html). The following list provides the codes for knee arthroscopy (24.5610) and all other arthroscopic interventions that may be performed during a surgical procedure to the knee in an ambulat ory setting: Arthroskopie Knie The frequencies of use of these codes provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health we re based on data from the SASIS Tarifpool (www.sasis.ch) and covered the majority of ambulat ory cases in Switzerland (91 -93% in 2014 and 79 -88% in 2013). The data were projected to the whole Swiss population (see section 4.2.2.7 ). Based on TARMED, the differentiation between degenerative knee cases and traumatic knee cases was not possible because no information concerning diagnoses and insurance coverage was availab le. For the base case cost calculations , the percentage of cases covered by accident insurance calculated for the Swiss Hospital Statistics were applie d. The frequencies provided represented the number of cases (not patients) . Thus, it was not possible to assess whether there were patients who had repeated arthroscopic surgery during the same calendar year. 4.1.2.6 Costs Alongside the two analytical strategies used to estimate the number of inpatients (see section 4.1.2.4 ), costs of inpatient procedures were estimated using two distinct approaches . The first approach was based on the diagnosis -related case costs statistics (Statistik diagnosebezogener Fallkosten) provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Statistics , which provides the mean costs per case for each Swiss DRG or APDRG code during a single calendar year.82 Costs were available for the years 2011 until 2014. For 2010, the costs provided in 2011 were applied. Table 16 and Table 17 summaris e the mean costs per case for the relevant APDRG codes in 2011 and for the Swiss DRG codes between 2012 and 2014. These costs per case were combined with the number of cases identified through the presence of at least one DRG code, ICD -10 code, and CHOP code in the Swiss Hospital Statistics 2010 to 2014 , acco rding to the first strategy to estimate patient numbers described in section 4.1.2.4 . Moreover, as already decided during the scoping, cases that were reimbursed by the accident insurance were excluded from the cost estimations. The second approach was based on an estimated cost per patient undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery between 2010 and 2014 . According to estimations from the insurance company Assura, this cost can range between CHF 3,700 for patients with compulsory insurance coverage (including a cantonal contribution of CHF 1,900) and CHF 13,200 for patients with supplementary private insurance.83 84 For the purpose of the main analysis, it was assumed that all hospitalized Seite 130 patients would be covered by the compulsory health insurance (i.e. that all would cost CHF 3,700), because the aim was to assess budget impact from a KVG perspective. The cost estimate of CHF 3,700 was combined with the number of all patients who had , in c ombination, at least one relevant diagnosis (ICD -10 code) and one relevant treatment (CHOP code) , according to the second strategy to estimate patient numbers described in section 4.1.2.4 Here again , cases with traumatic knee injuries (i.e. cases who were reimbursed be the accident insurance) were excluded. For the costs of ambulatory procedures , costs per single intervention or sub -intervention were available (e.g. CHF 429 for a knee arthroscopy, CHF 240 for a meniscus resection during a knee arthroscopy, CHF 119 for cleaning the meniscus during a knee arthroscopy). However, t hese costs did not represent th e total costs per intervention, since they did not include , for example , the costs of the consultation and use of the operating theatre , patient documentation , or anaesthesia. Moreover, the combinations of sub -procedures used to treat the patients were unk nown (only the total number of ambulatory interventions was available ). Therefore , the se cost data were not used in estimating the costs of outpatient cases. Instead, an estimate of cost per case by the insurance company Assura was again used. According to this source , the mean cost for an arthroscopic surgery of the meniscus performed in an ambulat ory setting would be approximately CHF 2,400.83 84 This cost estimat e was applied to all ambulat ory cases. It should be emphasi sed that the cost estimations were based on the number of identified cases (not on the number patients). Although it is relatively rare, during a single calendar year one single same patient may undergo a knee surgery more than once. Patients who were treat ed repeatedly were considered as separate cases.

The first analytical approach to estimate inpatient c osts described in section 4.1.2.4 was based on the diagnosis -related case costs statistics. Mean cost s per case according to different DRG codes were multiplied with the number of cases that reported at the same time a relevant DRG code, at least one relevant diagnosis, and at least one relevant treatment (excluding patients with traumatic knee injuries) . In sensiti vity analyses , the mean costs per case were varied by \u00b120% . Moreover, two additional patient selection scenarios were investigated: first, all cases that were classified with a relevant DRG code were included (regardless of whether they had a relevant ICD- 10 code or a relevant CHOP code). Second, all cases with a relevant DRG code except Swiss DRG code I59Z ( which potentially includes interventions to other joints or bones) and except Swiss DRG code I18A ( which is used for patients younger than 16 years) were considered . In the second analytical approach to estimate inpatient cost s, mean costs per case undergoing an arthroscopic knee surgery estimated by the insurance company Assura were applied to all cases that were reported at the same time with at least one relevant ICD -10 code and one relevant CHOP code. In the base case scenario it was assumed that all eligible cases would have compulsory health insurance (i.e. cost CHF 3,700). In the sensitivity analysis the estimated costs per case varied by 20%. In the scenario analysis all eligible cases were divided according to their insurance status ( compulsory , semi -private, or private insurance ). For all patients with basic insur ance, total costs of CHF 3,700 were applied. The costs for patients with a private insurance were assumed to be CHF 13,200. Finally, for the semi -private cases, the mean between compulsory and private insurance costs were applied (i.e. CHF 8,450). As for t he first strategy, cases that were reimbursed by the accident insurance (i.e. with traumatic knee injuries) were excluded from the cost estimations. In the estimation of the costs of ambulatory interventions , the mean cost for an arthroscopic surgery of th e meniscus estimated by the insurance company Assura (CHF 2,400 ) was combined with the number of knee arthroscopies according to TARMED positions. In the sensitivity analysis the estimated cost per case was varied by \u00b120%. Moreover, the ambulat ory costs were re- estimated assuming that all cases or only half of them were eligible (i.e. that 100% or 50% of the ambulat ory cases received the intervention due to a degenerative knee problem relating to the meniscus ). 4.2 Results The first part focuses on the cost -effectiveness of therapeutic knee arthroscopy compared to any other treatment in patients with degenerative changes of the knee according to the published literature. In the second part, the results of the budget impact analys is are reported . 4.2.1 Cost -effectiveness A total of 512 citations were identified from the electronic databases searche s. Following the removal of duplicates (n=79), full citations were reviewed ( Figure 42). Based on the title and Seite 133 abstract, 409 citations were excluded due to inappropriate comparator or non -comparative design; character of a review or commentary piece; inappropriate outcome meas ure; or no relevant cost information given. A total of 24 citations were included for full text review, of which another 20 were excluded for the same reasons as stated above. The remaining four articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria (Tabl e 18). They were included in the systematic review and assessed using the CHEERS checklist 72 and the algorithm shown in Figure 40. All four studies fulfilled the above -defined criteria for qualitative transferability, which was needed to make a study suitable for numerical adaptation of ICER results to Switzerland .

An overview of the characteristics and demographics of the patient populations modelled or included in the studies is provided in Table 19, together with information on intervention, comparator, setting, time horizons of the analyses, and the type of modelling. Here a summary is given . Three studies incorporated patients with knee osteoarthritis with a mean age ranging from 58 to 64 years ( Hutt 2015, Losina 2015, Marsh 2016 ). Lubowitz 2011 defined patients undergoing knee arthroscopy as patients having chondroplasty, lateral or medial meniscectomy, lateral or medial meniscus repair, lateral retinacular release, loose body removal, microfract ure, or synovectomy. However, the underlying diseases were not specified. In this study, the patient population was definitively younger, with a mean age of 44 years. Two studies specifically reported the severity of the included/modelled knee osteoarthrit is, which was measured with the Kellgren -Lawrence system (KL score ) (Marsh 2016, Losina 2015). Seite 135 In Marsh 2016 all patients had a KL score above 2, whereas in the modelling by Losina 2015 it was assumed that 55.2% of the patients would have a KL score above 2 . The gender distribution ranged from 39% to 56% male patients (in Marsh 2016 and Hutt 2015, respectively). In Losina 2015 , a Monte Carlo microsimulation, there was no information concerning gender. In Hutt 2015, patients were included only if they had failed a trial of non -operative treatment (analgesia, activity modification, and physical therapy). In all other studies patient inclusion was not condition al upon previously failed treatments. 4.2.1.1.2 Intervention and Comparator Two studies compared arthroscopic surgery to non -operative treatment, which consisted of physical therapy alone (Losina 2015) or physical and medical therapy (Marsh 2016). Losina 2015 modelled two types of arthroscopic interventions: arthroscopic partial m eniscectomy (APM) and delayed APM (i.e. PT followed by APM if subjects continued to experience pain). The other two studies assessed the cost -effectiveness of the intervention by comparing the status of the patients before and after knee arthroscopy (Hutt 2015 , Lubowitz 2011 ). 4.2.1.1.3 Main clinical data sources Marsh 2016 was based on the RCT by Kirkley 2008, evaluating the effectiveness of arthroscopic surgery in addition to optimized physical and medical therapy among patients with symptomatic, radiographic knee OA over a 2 -year period.51 Losina 2015 conducted a decision analysis, which was mainly based on data from the MeTeOR RCT, a multicentre RCT involving symptomatic patients with a meniscal tear and evidence of mild -to-moderate OA on radiographic and MRI imaging. 57 The cost -effectiveness analysis conducted by Hutt 2015 was based on prospectively, self-collected data from 43 patients with radiological OA that were assessed pre - and postoperatively. Similarly, Lubowitz 2011 used data on 93 patients before and after knee arthroscopy. 4.2.1.1.4 Type of economic evaluations All studies were cost -utility analyses , i.e. cost -effectiveness analyses using QALYs as the measure of clinical benefit. 4.2.1.1.5 Perspective of studies Two studies reported cost estimation s using a societal perspective, meaning that both direct and indirect costs were assessed ( Losina 2015, Marsh 2016), whereas the other studies used a healthcare perspective including exclusively direct medical costs (Hutt 2015 , Lubowitz 2011 ). 4.2.1.1.6 Time horizon of studies Hutt 2015 and Marsh 2016 used a short time horizon (1.5 years and 2 years, respectively) . Losina 2015 and Lubowitz 2011 used a 10 -year and lifetime horizon, respectively.

For all other studies discounting was not mentioned. 4.2.1.1.8 Measurement of cost and data sources The types of costs considered varied across studies ( Table 20). In two studies, both direct and indirect costs were assessed (Marsh 2016, Losina 2015). In these studies, direct costs included hospitalisation, surg ery, medication, and professional's fees. Indirect costs included productivity lost due to treatment and functional disability. In Hutt 2015 and Lubowitz 2011 , only direct medical costs , such as hospitalisation and surgery costs , were included. For the def inition of unit costs (i.e. costs for a surgery, an hospital day, medication, etc.), a variety of sources were used in the studies reporting a more comprehensive cost assessment (Marsh 2016, Losina 2015). In the other two studies , cost information came fro m a single, early cost - effectiveness analysis (in the case of Lubowitz 2011) and from the hospital where the study was performed ( in case of Hutt 2015).

Marsh 2016 assessed the effects of knee arthroscopy using two instruments: the changes in pain, stiffness, and physical function were measured with the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score over 2 -year follow -up, whe reas utility changes between baseline and 2-year follow -up were measured using a Standard Gambling technique derived from Kirkley 2008 (Table 21). QALYs were calculat ed as the product of the utility score and the duration of the corresponding health state. The estimate d incremental QALY s of arthroscopic surgery versus comparator were -0.02. Losina 2015 modelled the effects of knee arthroscopy over ten years using quart erly cycles, meaning that transitions between health states were possible every three months. Health states considered were early low pain, early moderate pain, late low pain, and late moderate pain. Distribution of pain relief using a transformed Knee inj ury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Pain scale as well as utilities assessed with an EQ -5D instrument was derived from the MeTeOR RCT .57 Fluctuation in OA -related pain were derived from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project and were stratified according to KL -grade (Table 21, Table 22).100 The estimate d incremental QALY s of arthroscopic surgery versus comparator ranged from 0.086 to 0.095 . Lubowitz 2011 assessed the health -related quality of life before and after knee arthroscopy using the self-administered Quality of Well -Being (QWB) scale.101 The resul ting score was multiplied by the life expectancy of each subject to obtain QALY estimates. The estimate d incremental QALY s of arthroscopic surgery versus comparator were 1.091. Hutt 2015 assessed pre - and postoperative effectiveness outcomes using the Oxfo rd Knee Score (OKS) and a visual analogue score (VAS). The OKS data were converted to EQ -5D score s using a published algorithm.102 The estimate d incremental QALY s of arthroscopic surgery versus comparator were 0.54. The quality of life results reported in the clinical section suggested that there was a numerical effect but no statistically significant effect on disease -specific quality of life in favour of arthroscopy compared to control, at short -term follow -up (SMD 0.18, 95% CI [ -0.02, 0.39], Figure 25; very low quality of evidence, Table 13) and at intermediate follow -up (SMD 0.17, 95% CI [ - 0.02, 0.36], Figure 26; moderate quality of evidence, Table 14). If compared with these clinical results , it appears that the above mentioned incremental QALY estimates were particularly optimistic in Lubowitz 2011 and Hutt 2015, where they were based on pre -post comparisons. They were less optimistic and potentially compatible in Losina 2015 . The slight QALY loss through arthroscopy in Marsh 2016 is also not formally incompatible with the clinical results, given that these were favouring arthroscopy (although estimates were not statistically significant ).

The two studies comparing knee arthroscopy with a non -operative comparator showed discordant results ( Losina 2015, Marsh 2016). According to Marsh 2016 , knee arthroscopy is dominated by non -operative treatments alone (i.e. arthroscopy was more expensive and less effective), independently from the perspective. In contrast, Losina 2015 reported that immediate and delayed APM may be cost -effective or cost -saving. In particular, delayed APM (i.e. APM after 3 months of physical therapy) seemed to dominate physical therapy alone from a societal perspective (i.e. APM was less expensive and more effective). If compared to physical therapy, immediate APM showed ICER s below USD 25,000 per QALY from a societal perspective and below USD 12,000 per QALY from a healthcare payer perspective . However, when compared to delayed APM, the ICERs for immediate APM increased to USD 103,000 per QALY from a healthcare perspective and USD 72,200 per QALY from a societal perspective. The two studies comparing patient status before and after knee arthroscopy concluded that arthroscopic knee surgery was cost -effective from a healthcare payer perspective : Lubowitz 2011 reported ICERs of USD 5,783 per QALY , whereas Hutt 2015 reported \u00a3 2,046 per QALY. According to the CHEERS checklist, the quality of the four assessed studies ranged from good (Marsh 2016 , Losina 2015 ) to poor ( Hutt 2015, Lubowitz 2011). Since all studies provided at least sufficient information on co sts and effects, and since the information concerning cost - effectiveness of knee arthroscopy was found to be very scarce, all results were adapted for Switzerland (Table 24, Figure 43). The adapted results for Switzerland were very similar to the original ones. The two studies comparing knee arthroscopy with a non -operative comparator were still going into opposite directi ons (Marsh 2016, Losina 2015), and the results of the two studies comparing patient status before and after knee arthroscopy were still similar (Hutt 2015, Lubowitz 2011) . Several potential explanatory factors were assessed i n order to understand the observed similarities and differences between studies. Due to completely different trial designs, i.e. intervention versus comparator and postoperative versus preoperative, the results of Marsh 2016 were principally compared with those of Losina 2015 , whereas the study by Lubowitz 2011 was compared to the study by Hutt 2015 . The studies of Marsh 2016 and Losina 2015 showed opposite results: in Marsh 2016 the comparator (non -operative treatment alone) dominated the intervention. In contrast, Losina 2015 suggested that immediate and delayed APM may be cost -effective (ICER < CHF 30,000) or cost -saving. Except for the age of the included population and the types of costs taken in to consideration, the two studies are not easily comparable . Marsh 2016 reported an economic evaluation of a single -centre RCT which included patients with symptomatic, radiographic knee OA,51 whereas Losina 2015 performed a Monte Carlo microsimulation of patients with both DMK and OA. Moreover, i n Marsh 2016 all patients had a KL grade 2, whereas almost half of the population in Losina 2015 had KL grade 0 -1. The modelling of effectiven ess, utility, and quality - adjusted life time were based on different assumptions and sources. The main element leading to discrepant results was the assessment of QALYs. In Marsh 2016 , patients receiving non -operative treatments accrued marginally higher Q ALYs than patients receiving arthroscop y (1.66 versus Seite 142 1.64). In contrast, the QALY gain reported by Losina 2015 , indirectly derived from results of the MeTeOR RCT , 57 showed better results in the intervention group (6.723 versus 6.637). The inclusion of patients with different characteristics may have contributed to this . Hutt 2015 and Lubowitz 2011 were based on comparisons of patients before and after knee arthroscopy and showed similar results. Considering the differences between the two studies, it was almost surprising to find very similar results (ICERs comparing postoperative status versus preo perative status of CHF 7,200-7,400 per QALY in both studies). Both studies were based on self-collected data and assessed similar types of costs (i.e. exclusively hospitalisation/intervention costs). However, the patients included by Lubowitz 2011 were younger (mean 43.9 years versus 64 years), whereas the time horizon of the analysis was much longer (lifetime versus 1.5 years). It should be emphasized that the quality of both studies, assessed with the CHEERS checklist, was poor. Important information was not or only partially provided.

Marsh 2016 reported a sensitivity analysis using 95% confidence limits. E ven when the largest possible treatment effect was assumed on this basis , the addition of arthroscopic surgery was not economically attractive compared with non -operative treatments only. Lubowitz 2011 reported that knee arthroscopy would remain highly cost -effective (< CHF 36,700) even after doubling the procedu re costs or halving the improvements in QWB scale scores. -2,000-1,000 - 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000 -0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2Incremental costs (CHF) Incremental QALY Marsh 2016, Healthcare payer perspective (CHF) Marsh 2016, Societal perspective (CHF) Losina 2015, Healthcare payer perspective (CHF), Immediate APM Losina 2015, Healthcare payer perspective (CHF), Losina 2015, Societal perspective (CHF), 2015, Societal perspective (CHF), Delayed APM Lubowitz 2011, Healthcare payer perspective (CHF) Hutt 2015, Healthcare payer perspective (CHF) Seite 146 Losina 2015 conducted sensitivity analyses that considered alternative scenarios regarding the efficacy of delayed APM and inclusion of indirect costs. Moreover, they also varied simultaneously the potential impact of APM on OA progression and the potential impact of delaying the surgical procedure on its overall efficacy. Finally, they reduced the time horizon of their analysis from 10 to 5 years. The results showed that physical therapy had 3.0% pr obability of being cost -effective at a willingness -to-pay (WTP) threshold of USD 50,000 per QALY, whereas delayed APM was cost - effective 57.7% of the time at a WTP of USD 50,000 per QALY and 50.2% at a WTP of USD 100,000 per QALY. The probability of immediate APM being cost -effective did not exceed 50% unless WTP exceeded USD 103,000 per QALY ( CHF 115,200 per QALY). 4.2.2 Budget impact analys es The main results, including the estimated number of eligible patien ts, the estimated annu al costs and results of the sensitivity analyses , are presented in the first part of this section. In the second part, details on the frequencies of occurrence of the selected DRG, ICD -10, CHOP, and TARMED codes are provided. 4.2.2.1 Patients eligible for the cost assessment The total number of eligible cases according to the two selection strategies is shown in Table 25. In the first strategy, only patients with a releva nt DRG code, with at least one relevant diagnosis (ICD -10 code), and at least one relevant treatment (CHOP code) were included. Between 2010 and 2011 the total number of cases did not change (11,922 in 2010 and 11,836 in 2011). Due to the change in the DRG coding system in 2012 , it was difficult to estimate a trend concerning the number of cases. In 2012, the number of cases was substantially higher than in the years before (14,816) , probably because of misclassification in the new coding system . As illustr ated in Table 26, almost all identified cases were classified under the Swiss DRG code I30Z. The number of cases between 2013 and 2014 were then lower than in 2010 and 2011, and were similar between each othe r (7,245 and 6,904, respectively). In the second strategy, all patients with at least one relevant diagnosis (ICD -10 code) and with one relevant treatment (CHOP code) were included, independently from the DRG codes. In contrast to the number of cases ident ified with the first strategy, the number of cases identified with the second strategy was more consistent over the five years period, most likely because DRGs were not considered. For this reason , the second strategy was considered more realistic than the first one. Additional analyses of the number of eligible cases stratified by relevant ICD -10 diagnoses are provided in the appendix ( Additional tables and analyses , Table 45). Concerning the number of eligible cases in the ambulant setting, available for 2013 and 2014 only, it was assumed that the percentage of cases covered by an accident insurance would be equal to the corresponding percentage in the Swiss Hospital Statistics (37%). Therefore, the number of cases that would meet the PIC criteria would be 6,136 in 2013 and 5,524 in 2014 (see section 4.2.2.7 ).

For the first strategy, the resulting estimates of total annual inpatient costs in 2010 and 2011 were CHF 59.31 Mio. and CHF 61.65 Mio., respectively. The costs in 2013 and in 2014 were lowe r with, CHF 38.79 Mio. and CHF 39.04 Mio., respectively. The were massively higher with CHF 134.68 Mio . The potential reasons for the outlying result for the year 2012 (new DRG coding system) has been described above. The difference s in cos t estimates between 2010 -2011 and 2013 -2014 are likely due to the different DRG coding systems (APDRG versus Swiss DRG). This first selection strategy is to be considered not valid for several reasons: first , not all patients who received an ICD-10 diagnosis for meniscus derangement or who received an arthroscopic treatment to the knee (represented by a CHOP code) were classified with one of the investigated DRG codes. Second , not all patients with a relevant DRG code received an arthroscopic treatment to the knee, according to the CHOP codes assigned. For example, in 2014 Seite 148 there were 22,665 cases with a relevant Swiss DRG code. Among them, 13,463 (59%) had a relevant ICD -10 diagnosis and 14,354 (63%) received a relevant treatment (CHOP code). After excluding cases reimbursed by the accident insurance, the total number of cases included in this cost estimation was 6,904, meaning that only 30% of the cases with potentially relevant Swiss DRG codes were included. Moreover, the inconsistency of thi s first approach is also emphasized in Table 27 , where total costs were divided according to the different DRG codes. The inconsistency between 2010 and 2014 can also be seen by calculating the mean costs per inpatient case, which were CHF 4,975 in 2010, 2011, CHF 5,354 in 2013, and CHF 5,655 in 2014. The second selection strategy including all cases that reported at least one relevant ICD -10 diagnosis and one relevant treatment (CHOP code), independent of DRG codes, and assuming mean costs per case of CHF 3,700, showed more stable results and was considered as more realisti c. The total annual outpatient costs, assuming costs of CHF 2,400 for each ambulatory case and assuming that the percentage of cases covered by an accident insurance would be the same as in the Swiss Hospital Statistics (37%), were estimated to be around CHF 14.73 Mio. in 2013 and CHF 13.26 Mio. in 2014.

According to the first strategy , including all patients who had at the same time at least one relevant DRG code, one relevant IC D-10 code and one relevant CHOP code, the total costs reached CHF 53.52 Mio. in 2013 and CHF 52.30 Mio. in 2014, with outpatient cases accounting for 25 -28% of the total costs. The total costs using the eligibility criteria of the second strategy (i.e. considering patients that had at the same time at least one relevant ICD -10 code and one relevant CHOP code) were CHF 71.93 Mio. in 2013 and CHF 67.73 Mio. in 2014 (20% attributable to outpatient cases). The reported costs were assessed using a KVG perspec tive. With the available information it was not possible to investigate the total annual costs from a societal perspective. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the total costs from a societal perspective would be much higher: patients undergoi ng arthroscopic knee interventions are often unable to work for several weeks. Therefore, indirect costs related to the loss of productivity are potentially very high.

CHF) Figure 45 Distribution of total inpatient costs (second strategy) and outpatient costs for arthroscopic surgeries to the knee in Switzerland in 2013 and 2014 (Mio. CHF) 4.2.2.3 Sensitivity analysis and scenario analyses The first inpatient cost calculation strategy was bas ed on the diagnosis -related case costs statistics. Mean costs per case according to different DRG codes were multiplied with the number of cases that reported at the same time a relevant DRG code, at least one relevant diagnosis, and Seite 151 at least one relevant treatment. The second inpatient cost calculation strategy was based on mean cost per patients undergoing an arthroscopic knee surgery assuming all patients would have compulsory insurance only. In the sensitivity analyses the mean costs per case was varied by \u00b120% (for the base case costs, see section 4.1.2.6 , Table 16 and Table 17). The main results were summaris ed in Table 29. Table 29 Sensitivity analyses - mean costs per case varied by \u00b120% First strategy Year 2010 2011 2012 , two alternative patient selection scenarios were investigated: first, all cases that were classified with a relevant DRG code, irrespective of their ICD -10 and CHOP codes, were included. For this scenario, the total inpatient costs increased dramatically (detailed information are available in the appendix , Table 47). For the years 2010 and 2011, the total inpatient costs increased from approximatively CHF 60 Mio. to more than CHF 90 Mio. (approximately +50%). For the years 2013 and 2014 the increase was even more pronounced, rising from approximatively CHF 40 Mio. to more than CHF 80 Mio. (ca. +100%). These estimations, driven by the limited suitability of the DRG coding system for the gi ven purpose, were obviously not realistic. A second alternative scenario included all cases with a rele vant Swiss DRG code but excluded two specific the Swiss DRG codes, namely I59Z and I18A. Code I59Z potentially includes interventions other joints or bones, whereas code I18A relates to patients younger than 16 years. This scenario was calculated for the y ears 2013 and 2014. The total costs estimations reached then CHF 70.91 Mio. in 2013 and CHF 71.91 Mio. in 2014, and hence, were also dramatically higher. In the scenario analysis of the second strategy , the inpatient costs were calculated according to the insurance status of the eligible patients , as reported in Table 30. Seite 152 Table 30 Distribution of cases according to their insurance status ( second inpatient cost estimation strategy ) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) illustrates the total inpatient costs by insurance status and year. The results suggest that between 2010 and 2014 there was a decrease in the total costs (from CHF 107.16 Mio. to CHF 92.59 M io.). This difference can be explained by two factors: first, the number of cases in 2010 was higher if compared to 2014 (15,703 versus 14,721). Second, the insurance distribution was different: in 2010 there were more patients with a private insurance (20 % versus 15% in 2014) and fewer patients with only compulsory insurance (54% versus 61% in 2014). As already mentioned the costs for patients with private insurance were considerably higher than those for patients with compulsory insurance ( CHF 13,200 versus CHF 3,700). It should be noted that the results of this scenario analysis cannot be interpreted as costs from a KVG perspective, as they include coverage of services not reimbursement by the compulsory health insurance. Table 31 Total costs for inpatients with at least one relevant ICD -10 code and one relevant CHOP code between 2010 and 2014, stratified by insurance status (second inpatient cost estimation strategy) Insurance status 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Mio. CHF (%) outpatient costs estimation, the mean costs for an arthroscopic surgery of the meniscus performed in an ambulatory setting were combined with the number of cases with relevant TARMED positions. In this sensitivity analysis the estimated costs per case was varied by \u00b120%. The resulting ambulatory costs ranged from CHF 11.78 to 17.67 CHF 15.91 Mio. in 2014. The scenario analysis assuming that all cases with a relevant TARMED code were eligible, i.e. assuming that all ambulatory cases received the intervention due to a degenerative knee problem and not a traumatic problem, resulted in total ambulatory costs of CHF 23.36 Mio. in 2013 and CHF 21.05 Mio. in 2014. In contrast, if only 50% of the patients were to have degenerative knee problems, the total ambulatory costs would have been CHF 11.69 Mio. in 2013 , and CHF 10.5 Mio. in 2014. Seite 153 4.2.2.4 Frequency of Swiss DRG and APDRG codes The numbers of cases that were hospitalized between 2010 and 2014 with relevant APDRG and Swiss DRG codes are reported in Table 32 and Table 33. The percentage of the cases that were reimbursed by the accident insurance is reported f or each year and for each DRG code. Table 32 Number of cases with relevant APDRG codes hospitalized in 2010 and 2011 APDR G Description 2010 2011 N % accident N % accident 221 Synovectomy and ligament reconstruction at the knee, with KK 227 36% 310 29% 222 Synovectomy and ligament reconstruction at the 254 20% 248 18% 918 10,175 32% 1222 Synovectomy and ligament reconstruction at with multiple interventions 11,256 46% 11,712 Seite 154 Table 33 Number of cases with relevant Swiss DRG codes hospitalized between 2012 and 2014 DRG Cod e Description 2012 2013 2014 N % accident N % accident N % accident I04Z Revision or replacement of the knee with complicating diagnose arthrodesis 296 10% 359 10% joints, age < 16 1,183 ions on 15 years 69 41% 11,563 Fibula, ankle joint or relatively complex interventions on knee joint, elbow joint and forearm 1,050 49% A brief review of the two tables suggest s that a comparison between the years 2010 -2011 and the years 2012 -2014 is very difficult since the coding system was completely different. It is also evident that 2012 was a transition year in which the treating physician s and coders still had to fully und erstand the new Swiss DRG coding system. In fact, in 2012 the great majority of the patients hospitalized for a knee problem received the Swiss DRG code I30Z \"Complex knee interventions\" (33,108 out of 35,728 cases , 93%), whereas all other Swiss DRG codes were more or less ignored. The coding was then normalized and relatively similar in 2013 and 2014. This suggests that in 2012 many patients were not optimally classified. Due to this change in the coding system between 2011 and 2012 , it is not possible to identify specific trends concerning the increase or decrease of specific DRG codes. In general, from 2010 to 2011, there was a decrease in the overall number of patients hospitalized with relevant APDRG codes (from 28,349 to 27,276, -4%). In contrast, from 2013 to 2014, there was an increase in the overall number of patients hospitalized with relevant Swiss DRG codes (from 20,306 to 22,665, +12%). The increase in the number of complex knee interventions was particularly pronounced (from 5,446 to 7,796, +43 %). The difference between the years 2010 -2011 and the years 2013 - 2014 is probably due to the different coding systems and to the fact that some DRG code s potentially included interventions at other joints (e.g. APDRG codes 232, 1232). 4.2.2.5 Frequency of ICD -10 codes The ICD -10 codes provided in the Swiss Hospital Statistics were particularly detailed. The complete list of relevant ICD -10 codes used between 2010 and 2014 is shown in Table 34. The percentage of cases that were reimbursed by the accident insurance is reported only for 2014, because it was similar in the previous years. For example, the code \" M23.2: Derangement of meniscus due to old tear or injury\" was divided in \"M23.20: Derangement of unspecified meniscus due to old tear or injury\", \"M23.21: Derangement of anterior horn of medial meniscus old tear or injury\", \"M23.22: Derangement of posterior horn of or injury\", M23.23: Derangement of other medial meniscus due to old tear or injury\", \"M23.24: Derangement of anterior horn of lateral meniscus due to old tear or injury\", \"M23.25: Derangement of posterior horn of lateral meniscus due to old tear or injury\", \"M23.26: Derangement of other lateral meniscus due to old tear or injury\", and \"M23.29: Not specified derangement of meniscus\". To allow for easier interpretation, ICD -10 codes were grouped in Table 35 and Figure 46 as described in the methods. In general, a constant increase in the total number of diagnoses can be noticed between 2010 and 2014 (27,300 relevant diagnoses in 2010 to 33,919 diagnoses in 2014). This increase is mainly due to an increase in the diagnoses of derangemen t of meniscus due to old tear or injury (M23.2), other meniscus derangements (M23.3), and other internal derangements of knee (M23.8). In contrast, unspecified internal derangement of knee (M23.9) and tear of meniscus (S83.2) remained constant through the years. The percentage of cases that were reimbursed by the accident insurance varied from 17% for other meniscus derangements to 70% for tear of meniscus. This suggest s that some ICD -10 are mostly related to traumatic problems (e.g. ICD -10 S83.2: tear of m eniscus), whereas other s are more frequent in patients with degenerative diseases (e.g. ICD -10 code M23.3: other meniscus derangements). Importantly, the total number of diagnoses (i.e. ICD -10 codes) doesn't reflect the total number of treated patients. In fact, each case potentially received multiple relevant diagnoses (for example Seite 156 a derangement of anterior horn of medial meniscus due to old tear or injury combined with a derangement of posterior horn of medial meniscus due to old tear or injury ). Table 36 and Figure 47 illustrate how many cases received given number s of relevant ICD -10 codes . In general, most cases received a single diagnosis for knee/meniscus derangement. For example, out of 26,290 cases h ospitalized in 2014 with a relevant ICD -10 code, 20,069 (76%) had a single knee -related diagnosis, 5,081 (19%) had two knee -related diagnoses, and 1,140 (4%) had three or more knee - related diagnoses. Interestingly, the percentage of cases with relevant diagnoses based on ICD -10 codes reimbursed by the accident insurance was higher than in those who had multiple meniscus derangement diagnoses (43% versus 16-27%).

The codes in 2010 were merged in to bigger categories. Table 37 shows the total number of CHOP codes related to knee surgical interventions between 2010 and 2014. The percentage of cases that were reimbursed by the accident insurance is reported only for 2014, because it was similar in the previous years. Importantly, the total number of CHOP codes doesn't reflect the total number of treated patients. A patient could potentially receive multiple knee treatments (CHOP codes) during a single hospitalization (for example a knee arthroscopy followed by a synovectomy and a meniscectomy). In general, between 2011 and 2013, the total number of CHOP codes increased by over 2,000 per year (from 48,093 in 2011 to 50,131 in 2012 and 52,631 in 2013). In contrast, betwe en 2013 and 2014 the total number of CHOP codes remained stable. The numbers extracted from the Swiss Hospital Statistics for 2010 were only partially interpretable. For the CHOP categories 80.6 and 80.76, the numbers were comparable to those reported in t he following years for the CHOP codes 80.6X.10/ 80.6X.11 and 80.76.10, respectively. In contrast, for the other groups of CHOP categories in 2010 the numbers appeared to be higher, suggesting that other CHOP codes non - related to knee arthroscopy were included as well. For example, the CHOP group 80.26 in 2010 included almost 35,000 interventions, whereas the sum of the codes 80.26.00, 80.26.10, 80.26.20, and 80.26.99 in the following years reached 8,590 in 2011, 4,769 in 2012, 3,019 in 2013, and only 1,872 in 2014. 05'00010'00015'00020'00025'00030'000 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Number of patients Year1 2 3+ Total Seite 160 Interestingly, the use of some CHOP codes decreased drastically between 2011 and 2014 (80.26.00, 80.26.10, 80.26.99), whereas other s 80.6X.10, 80.76.10, 80.86.10, 81.47.22, and 81.47.24). The trends for the most frequent CHOP codes between 2011 and 2014 are illustrated in Figure 48. Table 38 illustrates how many cases received a given number of relevant CHOP codes . For example, in 2014 there were 15,048 hospitalized cases who received one single relevant CHOP code , 9,150 who rece ived two relevant CHOP codes and 4,322 who received three relevant CHOP codes . Between 2010 and 2011 there were five patients who received during their hospitalisation up to 11 relevant CHOP codes (one main treatment , 10 secondary treatments ). For example, one patient in 2011 received following codes describing the surgical 2011 to 2014 about half of the cases received only one single knee CHOP code , whereas the other half received two or more CHOP codes . Except for 2010, it can be noticed that the total number of hospitalized cases receiving at least one CHOP code remained constant (around 30,000 -31,000 per year).

Assuming that the percentage of cases covered by an accident insurance would be similar to the percentage seen in the Swiss Hospital Statistics (37%), the number of cases meeting the ambulatory PIC criteria was estimated t o be 6,136 in 2013 and 5,524 in 2014. Table 39 Number of ambulant arthroscopic interventions to the knee/meniscus Knie 623 Seite 52 the represents total number of knee arthroscopies . All other TARMED codes illustrate the interventions that may be performed during a knee arthroscopy . As a combination of several interventions is possible, the total number of knee arthroscopies is lower than the sum of all interventions. Seite 164 5 Discussion This report assessed the clinical effectiveness and economic consequences in patients with knee pain due t o osteoarthritis and meniscal degeneration undergoing knee arthroscopy compared to control . The results of the clinical effectiveness and safety assessment are discussed first, followed by the discussion of the results of the cost -effectiveness and budget impact analyses . In the final section, results from both parts of the HTA are discussed jointly. 5.1 Clinical effectiveness and safety 5.1.1 PICO 1 Twenty -one RCTs were included in the report on the effectiveness and safety of arthroscopy in patients with degenera tive changes of the knee. There is no evidence that arthroscopic interventions have any benefit on outcomes measured at short - or intermediate follow -up with the exception of a small effect on the reduction of pain at short follow -up. Therefore, it remains unclear whether knee arthroscopy has an effect on the assessed outcomes. Long -term follow -up data were not available. Reporting on harm was scarce and no conclusion c an be drawn regarding the benefit -harm balance. Cross -over rates to surgery in control patients w ere considerable. This may have affected the results and under the intention -to-treat ( ITT) approach this might have reduced treatment effects for some outcomes in particular for intermediate or long -term follow - up. This bias c ould only be compensated for in an individual patient data meta -analysis, with censoring of patients at the time of switching. However, this would also imply that patient relevant outcomes would have been measured at the time of switching , allowing for an adequate time - updated analysis. The overall quality of evidence at short - and intermediat e follow -up was judged very low and low, respectively. In addition, there is no evidence that the subgroup of patients with solely DMK has a benefit from arthroscopic treatment. The quality of evidence was judged very low and low for most of the outcomes, mainly because of limitations of the included RCTs. Effect estimates of subjective outcomes (most outcomes of the present report are patient reported) are likely to b e overestimated if blinding is missing110-112, which causes substantial uncertainty of the empirical evidence. Blinding of patients and outcome assessors may be challenging in this context. Sham intervention s may put patients at risk and therefore have serious ethical implications , which nowadays might be considered as unacceptable .113 Of the 21 RCTs, only four (FIDELITY 2013, Kalunian 2000, Moseley 1996, Moseley 2002) reported blinding (sham/placebo surgery) of patients and person nel. Interestingly, cross - over rate in one of th e blinded RCTs (FIDELITY 2013) was less than 5% (the other three did not report cross -over), and hence was lower than in several other non -blinded RCTs where cross -over rates varied between 0% to 35% (see section 8.4.4 of Appendix 5). Overall, eleven RCTs reported cross -over (defined as patients in the comparator arm who received subsequent arthroscopic surgery) in 118 out of 637 (18.5%) patients in the control group. It appears that cross -over rates are lower in adequately blinded studies, but this is not the only reason for the variation of cross - over rates between trials. For instan ce, patients with preference for arthroscopy might only accept trial participation if th ere is the opportunity to switch intervention s. From the trial protocol of MeTeOR (highest cross -over rate), it is stated that control patient s who received physical therapy Seite 165 were at \"any time \" allowed to switch to arthroscopy ; hence, patient s with preference for arthroscopy were probably more like ly to accept the trial conditions including the risk to be randomized into the physical therapy group. This is in contrast of the blinded FIDELITY study where cross -over was also allowed, but no earli er than 6 months after sham surgery. This might have prevented patients with preference for arthroscopy from participat ing. In general, the reporting of whether , or when , cross -over was allowed was very inconsistent and could not be assessed further. To co nclude this paragraph and as mentioned above, h igh cross -over rates are problematic in the ITT analysis, and may lead to underestimation of treatment effects of the intervention. However, in daily routine, it is frequent that patients receiving conservativ e treatment will switch to arthroscopic intervention, and hence the RCT findings may well reflect a realistic scenario. A further limitation of the RCTs was the high risk of attrition bias. Attrition was high or unclear in most of the included RCTs. Missin g outcome data impact effect estimates; therefore, a high proportion of missing data can lead to biased estimates. This is important for rare binary outcomes, especially if the ratio of participants with missing data to participants with events is high .10 Attrition in combination with the scarce reporting of harm ( adverse event s and serious adverse event s) make it impossible to draw any conclusions about potential harm caused by the intervention. Of note, in two RCTs (Kang 2005, Vermesan 2013) the unit of randomisation was unclear , or knees were randomised ; thus, in both RCTs it was unclear whether global a ssessment was reported per knee or per patient. If both knees were operated in some patients, these observations cannot be analysed as independent observations. Ignoring this fact in the analysis will lead to biased estimates because the data are clustered .114 Therefore, the findings of these RCTs were reported separately. The patient populations with pain due to degenerative changes of the knee were very heterogeneous and did not allow for a clear distinction between patients with OA and DMK. First, patients presenting with pain from knee OA often have OA in combination with DMK or vice versa. From the existing literature it was expected that the prevalence of DMK in patients with sympt omatic OA might range between 39% and 76%.115 -118 Second, clinical diagnosis does not allow for a clear distinction of pain due to OA or DMK. The populations of the included RCTs were typically recruited because of persistent knee pain. Whereas radiographic evidence was used in most RCTs to assess OA, on ly few used MRI or arthroscopic evidence to assess potential meniscus degenerations. Degenerative meniscal le sions are increasing with age and many individuals with such le sions are asymptomatic. Diagnosis of both OA and DMK is thus not entirely dependent on MRI or x -ray, which only reveal structural changes of the knee joint, but must be made by integrating physical examination, patient history, duration and severity of symptoms and findings from imaging techniques .116 119 -121 The radiographic evidence in combination with physical examination often provides an incomplete picture. For example, degenerative meniscus is often revealed only post -hoc during arthroscopy. It should be underlined that structural damage of the knee is not always associated with dysfunctional and/or painful symptoms in the general population.116 122 123 In the present report, the populations of the included RCTs were classified into four groups. This classification system may have some limitations, but was considered the best available compromise. Our approach is in line with existing literature.33-39 Fourteen of the 21 included RCTs were classified as having included patients without allowing for a clear classification and were rated as 'mixed unclear'. Moreover, in the included RCTs, arthroscopic interventions often revealed additional pathologies in addition to previously known radiographic signs of OA. For Seite 166 instance, in the only RCT recruiting pati ents with OA only and which excluded patients with large meniscal tears (Kirkley 2008) , around 80% of patients received meniscal debridement during arthroscopic intervention due to smaller lesions that had not been identified by MRI. These observations und erline that a clear distinction between DMK and OA may be difficult to achieve in daily routine. Based on the observed effects within sub -groups of RCTs representing DMK only and OA only patients, no conclusions can be drawn on whether an OA or a DMK popul ation would benefit from therapeutic arthroscopy. Several RCTs reported that a considerable number of eligible patients refused to participate. In the seven RCTs with more than 150 patients (FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014, Kirkley 2008, Kise 2016, KIVIS, MeTeOR, Moseley 2002), between 3.2% and 59% of eligible patients declined to participate. Where reported, the main reason was patient preference for one of the randomised treatments. Patients' preference for one treatment (arthroscopy or comparator) does affect ov erall generalizability of findings .124 125 Some instruments for assessing OA are not suita ble for patients with any kind of disorder of the knee.126 For instance, the frequently reported KOOS was initially developed for a population at risk of developing OA ; currently, only the Swedish and Dutch version s of the instrument are validated for a mixed patient population with osteoarthritis and/ or meniscal tears. The English version is not validated for assessing a mixed population.127-129 Both RCTs (Gauffin 2014, Herrlin 2007) using the KOOS instrument in patients with only DMK were conducted in Sweden; however, a recent systematic review reported flaws in the Swedish KOOS version, questioning the instrument's validation for meniscal tears.127 This systematic review critically appraised the instruments used to measure patient -reported outcomes in patients with meniscal tears and the authors concluded that the evidence for the validity of the instrum ents available for this population was of poor quality and incomplete.127 This is a matter of concern mainly for the critical outcomes of pain, function and global assessment (measured by KOOS, Lysholm, WOMAC, and International Knee Documentation Committee), and WOMET, a disease specif ic quality of life measure , but less so for the EQ -5D, which is a generic instrument that has been widely validate in many different language and patient populations . Measuring an outcome with a wrong or inappropriate instrument can affect the judgment of the quality of evidence according to GRADE . Though instruments used were not always validated to assess a mixed population , the quality of evidence was not downgraded for serious indirectness because of the uncertainty of the distinction between imminent c auses of knee degeneration and pain (see above OA and DMK) in most RCTs; hence, the magnitude of indirectness was not assessable. Adverse event s were inconsistently reported in most RCTs. Three RCTs (Biedert 2000, FIDELITY, Gauffin 2014) counted and repor ted patients undergoing subsequent surgery as patients having an adverse event . In these RCTs it was not possible to distinguish between patients crossing over and undergoing subsequent surgery , and those with an adverse event . This approach may have led to an increased numbers of patients with adverse event in the comparator group (arthroscopy 12/173 [6.9%] versus control 29/163 [17.8%] ). However, in four RCTs , patients with adverse event s were reported separately from those w ith subsequent surgery . In these trials , the number of patients with adverse event s was balanced between groups (arthroscopy 31/389 [8.0%] versus control 29/398 [7.3%] ). In general, safety outcomes were rarely reported and might be biased due to high attri tion in several RCTs (see discussion above). Hence the quality of evidence was low to very low for adverse event s and very low for serious adverse event s. Consequently, too few data were available to weigh potential benefits against potential harms. A rece nt systematic review compared arthroscopy with conservative treatment in patients with degenerative knee Seite 167 disease while assessing complications reported in retrospective cohort studies and RCTs. The authors concluded that within a three -month time frame the re is probably a small risk of mortality, venous thromboembolism, infection or nerve damage due to knee arthroscopy.130 In addition , cohort studies reported that adverse event s or complications due to arthroscopy occurred in 0.02% to 1% of patients within a three -month time frame.131-133 An abundance of literature has been published on therapeutic knee arthroscopy; therefore, for the purposes of this discussion, it was decided to focus on reviews published after 2012 since m ore than a third of the RCTs included in this report were published after that time . Sixteen reviews (both narrative and systematic reviews including meta -analyses) were found from 2012 onwards33-39 130 134 -141, along with two HTA report s.4 142 The most relevant systematic reviews with meta -analyses are briefly addressed . Thereof, the IQWiG assessed the effect of arthroscopy in an OA population in 2014, Khan et al. and van de Graaf et al. in patients with mainly degenerative meniscus in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and Brignardello -Petersen et al. in patients with both OA and DMK in 2017.4 35 39 130 Compared to IQWiG, two RCTs conducted in OA patients were added in the present report (\u00d8ster\u00e5s 2012, Saeed 2015) ; \u00d8ster\u00e5s 2012 was not found by the IQWiG search and Saeed 2015 was published thereafter. No additional RCTs with degenerative meniscus patients were identified compared to the reviews by Khan et al. or van de Graaf et al., but the present report added a substantia l number of additional RCTs that were conducted in patients with degenerative osteoarthritic knee disease compared to the review by Brignardello -Petersen et al. In the present report, nine more RCTs were included. In general, the findings of the present report are in line with those from these recent evidence syntheses. For endpoints at short -term follow -up, these systematic reviews reported either no or only small statistically significant differences between arthroscopy and comparators for pain and funct ion outcomes.4 35 39 The IQWiG HTA found no indication of benefit for the treatment of OA when comparing arthroscopy to non -active or active comparators for the outcomes pain, function, global assessment and quality of life.4 Khan et al. evaluated the effectiveness of arthroscopy in populations with degenerative tears of the meniscus with mild or no OA and reported no statistically significant difference in pain scores at short -term follow -up when comparing arthroscopy to non -operative treatment (MD 0.20, 95% CI [ -0.67, 0.26] ).35 A small, statistically significant differe nce in favour of arthroscopy was found for function at short -term follow -up (SMD 0.25, 95% CI [0.02, 0.48]). However, this difference was judged by the authors as not clinically relevant (0.5 SD).35 The more recent review by van de Graaf et al. compared arthroscopic partial meniscectomy to conservative treatment for patients with non -obstructive meniscal tears.39 Statistically significant differences favouring arthroscopic surgery were found at six months for pain (KOOS MD 3.56, 95% CI [0.18, 6.95] or rating MD 0.56, 95%CI [0.28, 0.83]) function ). These d ifferences were considered clinically irrelevant.39 Overall, short -term results differed little from the results of the present report and the reported differences were too small to be potentially clinically relevant. The small difference in short -term function outcomes between this report and the reports b y Khan et al. and van de Graaf et al. is probably attributable to methodological differences, such as different inclusion and exclusion criteri a. At intermediate follow -up, findings on pain and function outcomes presented in this report were consistent wi th those of recently published reviews, where no statistically significant effects were found between arthroscopy and control.4 35 39 Seite 168 A systematic review including RCTs and non -randomis ed studie s published by Brignardello - Petersen et al. in 2017 evaluated the benefits and harms of knee arthroscopy versus conservative management in patients with degenerative knee disease.130 Though the present report found nine additional RCTs compared to that review, the reported results a re very similar. Small statistically significant differences were fou nd at short -term follow -up of three months for pain (MD 5.38, 95% CI [1.95, 8.81] ) and function (MD 4.94, 95% [1.50, 8.38]), while no statistically significant differences between arthroscopy and conservative treatment were found at long -term follow -up of up to two years for pain and function.130 In addition, no statistically significa nt beneficial effects were found for quality of life and knee replacement, which is consistent with the findings of this report.130 The Brignardello -Petersen et al. review did not look at OA only and DMK only populations, but assessed subgroups based on OA status (based on radiographic evidence) and reported that OA status did not affect the interpretation of the effect estimates for pain and function.130 All systematic reviews, including the present HTA report, found that safety outcomes ( adverse event s and serious adverse event s) were poorly reported. The 2014 IQWiG report did not draw any conclusions regarding harm, because of insufficient data, while the review by va n de Graaf et al. was only able to summarise the reported adverse event s of two RCTs.4 39 Brignardello -Petersen et al. included non -randomised studies in addition to RCTs to assess harms, though heterogeneity was high and the assessed time frame was, despite non -randomised studie s, limited to three months.130 In conclusion, there is no evidence that arthroscopic interventions have any benefit on o utcomes measured at short - or intermediate follow -up, with the exception of a small effect on pain at short follow -up. Therefore, it remains unclear whether knee arthroscopy has an effect on the assessed outcomes. Long -term follow -up data were not availabl e. Reporting on harm was scarce and no conclusion s can be drawn regarding the benefit -harm balance. The overall quality of evidence at short - and intermediate follow -up was judged to be very low and low, respectively. In addition, there is no evidence that the subgroup of patients with solely DMK has a benefit from arthroscopic treatment. F indings of this assessment may be generalizable to a broader population experiencing knee pain due to a degenerative knee disorder . The findings are consistent with recently published reviews. 5.1.2 PICO 2 Arthroscopic procedures on the knee can be performed in the inpatient or outpatient setting . The inpatient setting in theory facilitates immediate post intervention care or pain management, while patient preference and r educed costs are potential advantages of the outpatient setting. Only one RCT (Weale 1998) identified compared the inpatient setting with the outpatient setting. This single RCT had several limitations, such as high risk of bias, reporting of pain only in the week after discharge and low sample size. About 30% of the participants in both arms received only a diagnostic arthroscopy and no intervention. Only 10% and 16% of the patients in the outpatient or short -stay groups, respectively, were diagnosed with OA. Half of the patients in either group with meniscal tears received meniscectomy. Moreover, three participants (6%) crossed -over from the outpatient to the inpatient group, while six participants (12%) crossed -over from the inpatient to the outpatient group. Because over a third of the RCT population received only Seite 169 diagnostic arthroscopy and no follow -up outcomes were reported, no generalizable conclusions can be made. 5.2 Cost -effectiveness and budget impact The systematic search of economic studies identi fied four eligible cost -effectiveness studies. Two studies compared knee arthroscopy to non -operative treatment (Losina 2015, Marsh 2016). Two other studies were based on an assessment of patient status before and after arthroscopy (Hutt 2015, Lubowitz 201 1). All studies were cost -utility analyses, i.e. cost -effectiveness analyses using QALYs as the measure of benefit. Three studies based their calculations on prospectively collected information (Hutt 2015, Lubowitz 2011, Marsh 2016). The study by Marsh 201 6 was based on the RCT by Kirkley 2008, evaluating the effectiveness of arthroscopic surgery in addition to optimized physical and medical therapy in patients with symptomatic, radiographic knee OA over a 2 -year period.51 The decision analytic modelling conducted by Losina 2015 was mainly informed by data from the MeTeOR RCT, a multicentre study involving symptomatic patients with a meniscal tear and evidence of mild -to-moderate OA.57 The cost -effectiveness analysis conducted by Hutt 2015 was based on data from a cohort of 43 patients with radiolo gical OA that were assessed pre - and postoperatively. Similarly , Lubowitz 2011 analysed data on a cohort of 93 patients before and after knee arthroscopy. Marsh 2016 reported that knee arthroscopy is more expensive and less effective than non - operative interventions alone. The three other studies were in favour of knee arthroscopy. The results of Losina 2015 suggested that arthroscopic surgery may be cost -effective (ICER < CHF 30,000 per QALY gained ) or even cost -saving if compared to physic al therapy alone. The studies conducted by Lubowitz 2011 and Hutt 2015 showed very similar results, suggesting that knee arthroscopic intervention ameliorate d the condition of patients, with an ICER of CHF 7,200 -7,400 per QALY gained . The quality of report ing of Lubowitz 2011 and Hutt 2015 assessed with the CHEERS checklist was poor, showing significant reporting issues that may hint at underlying methodological issues (affecting the design, methods and results). Comparing preoperative status with postopera tive status does not represent a reliable basis for deciding whether an intervention is cost -effective or not. In contrast to RCTs, pre -post clinical studies provide, in general, very low -quality evidence of clinical effectiveness (see section 3.1.7 ). Losina 2015 and Marsh 2016 were of higher reporting quality. They were based on different designs, assumptions, and sources and led to discordant resul ts. Several methodological issues were identified. In particular, Losina 2015 appears to be affected by several methodological flaws which will be detailed. Losina 2015 was the only study partially based on a RCT with contemporary controls (i.e. comparing arthroscopic surgery with a control group) and showing results in favour of knee arthroscopy. These results were inconsistent with those of the present assessment of the clinical effectiveness and safety of arthroscopy (see section 3.2); hence, a more detailed discussion is needed . The effectiveness assumptions used to populate the model were scrutinized. The authors reported that distributions of pain relief three months after initial treatment ( arthroscopy or physical therapy) were derived from the MeTeOR RCT using a transformed Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Pain scale.57 Moreover, based on the expert opinion of a panel of MeTeOR clinical investigators, the authors assumed that changes in pain status attributable to a specific treatment would be limited to the first six months following that Seite 170 treatment (i.e. si x months after arthroscopy or after initiation of physical treatment). For use in the health economic model, pain results from MeTeOR were dichotomized at a KOOS score of 25, with scores above 25 characterized as 'Moderate Pain' and scores at or below 25 as 'Low Pain'. Transition probabilities for pain and pain resolution were stratified by OA severity.57 100 Utilities for low and hig h pain were also derived from the MeTeOR RCT and were assumed to be equal across study groups. The change in overall QALYs across groups was driven by different probabilities of failed pain relief (patients undergoing physical therapy only had a higher probability of failed pain relief if compared to patients undergoing surgery), and different probabilities of pain incidence and pain resolution (higher for patients undergoing surgery). A closer look at the MeTeOR RCT published in 2013 revealed several pote ntial issues . First, contrasting Losina the cost -effectiveness of arthroscopy , the overall results of the RCT indicated only a small positive effect of arthroscopy compared to no surgical treatment in WOMAC physical function and KOOS pain scores, both in favour of knee arthroscopy (see Figure 2A and 2B in Katz 2013 ) that was only visible after the first three months of follow -up. At six months after randomisation differences were very small and non -significant (probably below the minimal important difference for the measurement instruments used). After twelve months of follow -up, both study groups showed almost identical reductions in WOMAC physical function and KOOS pain scores. Unfortunately, t he derivation of the approaches for after three months (i.e. when the difference in favour of knee arthroscopy were less pronounced or even inexistent) was insufficiently described. This could have led to biased results in favour of arthroscopy. Second, de spite reporting similar WOMAC physical function scores and KOOS pain scores, the two patient groups in the MeTeOR RCT were slightly different concerning the severity of OA. In particular, the arthroscopy group included patients with more severe OA (28.0% K L grade 3 versus 23.1% in the physical therapy group).57 The inclusion of more severe patients may have had an impact on overall score changes after arthroscopy . In fact, in their supplementary table 3, Katz 2013 reported a higher mean change in WOMAC score in the arthroscopy group only for KL grades 0 -2 (21.9 versus 17.2 in the physical therapy group). In contrast, patients with KL grade 3 in the arthroscopy group reported lower improvements in WOMAC scores if compared to the physical therapy group (19.0 versus 21.9). Including less severe patients in the physical therapy group may have favoured non -operative treatment . Additional issues in the paper by Losina 20 15 include lack of clarity in the description of how the probabilities of pain incidence and pain resolution were derived. For example, for patients undergoing delayed arthroscopy after physical therapy, the probabilities of pain incidence or pain resoluti on three months after treatment were set to zero (compared to a range of 0.115 -0.227 for physical therapy and 0.230 -0.483 for immediate arthroscopy ). It remains unclear if for this patient group, the authors started the modelling only at the time point of the delayed arthroscopy, which would not be state -of-the-art. Moreover, the assumption concerning the effectiveness of delayed arthroscopy was based on only 24 patients that crossed -over between three and six months. Given the limited number of patients , the risk of inaccurate results is particularly high. A lack of clarity was also found regarding the link between utilities and pain status: the authors reported that RCT - based utilities were calculated for two pain status groups, based on EQ -5D results (of note, EQ -5D results were not reported in the publications of the MeTeOR RCT, as the EQ -5D results were specific to economic analyses as outlined in the trial protocol) . However, the approach to calculation was not described. Also, the authors mentioned tha t the utilities were derived from the MeTeOR study, where participants were asked to fill out the EQ -5D instrument. However, in the mentioned publication ,57 the collection of these data was not reported (and is therefore absent Seite 171 from the effectiveness section in this report). A lack of explanation was also noticed regarding the derivation of several other inputs parameters. For example, the auth ors did not explain how the clinical end economic parameters for the periods following the first year of follow -up were derived from OA cohort studies. It is therefore impossible to judge whether their calculations were methodologically correct and whether the assumptions were realistic. A final major issue in the underlying MeTeOR RCT was the high cross -over rate from conservative treatment (physical therapy) to arthroscopy. Out of 167 patients in the physical therapy group, 62 subjects (37%) finally under went arthroscopy (26 subjects in the first three months after randomisation, 24 subjects between three and six months follow -up, and 12 patients after six months follow -up). Exploratory results (Figure 2C and supplement page 2 in Katz 2013 ) suggest more su bstantial improvements in the cross -over patients compared to those who remained on conservative treatment.57 How the effects of cross -over were considered in the derivation of the input parameters in the model of Losina 2015 remain s unclear. The above -mentioned aspects suggest that the results reported by Losina 2015 are not sufficiently valid . Given how the methodological approaches are presented, the mechanism behind the reported favourable cost -effectiveness results ( which contra st the much less clear -cut overall results of MeTeOR) remains unclear. The study by Marsh 2016 concluded that arthroscopic surgery in addition to non -operative treatment (i.e. physical therapy) for knee OA is not an economically attractive treatment optio n if compared to non -operative treatment alone. The results were based on a self -conducted, single centre RCT including 168 patients (represented in the assessment of the clinical effectiveness and safety as Kirkley 2008).51 As in the case of Losina 2015, several issues have to be considered. First, despite randomisation, the patient characteristics in the intervention and non -operative groups differed with regard to gender distribution (39% versus 28% in the non -operative group), (48% versus 42% KL grade 2 and 53% KL grade 3 in the non -operative group), and WOMAC total scores (1222.9 versus 1354.1 points in the non -operative group; the WOMAC score was rescaled here so that a higher number indicated a better outcome). After 24 months follow -up, the WOMAC scores for the two groups were 1526.4 and 15 10.8, respectively . This implied that patients undergoing arthroscop y had a higher improvement than patients in the non -operative group (+303.5 versus +155.5 points). Interestingly, the differences in WOMAC scores between the patient groups were not reflec ted in terms of utilities (utilities were measured with a standard gamble technique). In fact, the baseline utilities as well as the utilities reported after 24 months follow -up were almost identical: 0.79\u00b10.22 in the arthroscopy group versus 0.80\u00b10.21 in the non -operative group at baseline and 0.84\u00b10.23 versus 0.86\u00b10.16 at 24 months. Second, in the cost -effectiveness analysis the authors assumed a QALY increase of 1.64\u00b10.40 in the arthroscopy group and an increase of 1.66\u00b10.30 in the non -operative group. T he very small QALY difference in favour of the non -operative treatment, combined with its lower costs if compared to arthroscop y, led to a situation in which physical therapy dominated arthroscop y. Still, considering the differences in the group characteri stics and the limited differences in utilities and QALYs (alongside considerably larger standard deviations), a clear conclusion on a final judgement on the cost -effective ness of the alternative treatments is not possible . Given the very limited health economic evidence, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the cost -effectiveness of arthroscopic surgery in patients with degenerative changes of the knee. Although three out of four eligible studies reported arthroscopy to be cost -effective, this cannot Seite 172 be regarded as convincing, given the methodological issues described above and also in light of the results of the clinical part of this HTA (see section 5.3). On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that arthroscopic surgery may be an economically sensible option for some groups of patients, e.g. in light of cross -over observed in the available RCTs. The objective of the budget impact analysis was to investigate the total in - and outpatient costs of arthroscopic surgery in patient s with DMK in Switzerland . According to the scope, the population included in this analys is was meant to be slightly different from the population addressed in the clinical review and in the assess ment of cost -effectiveness, which considered patients with any degenerative knee problems . The results of the budget impact analysis suggested that the total expenditure for knee/meniscus derangement in Switzerland , aimed at approximating CHF 67.73 Mio. in 2014. Outpatient costs accounted for 20 -28% of the total costs. The results of the budget impact analysis according to our second patient selection strategy , i.e. a strategy based on ICD -10 codes and CHOP codes which were considered as more realistic than the first strategy also considering DRG codes , suggested total inpatient costs of CHF and CHF 54.47 Mio. in 2014. Total outpatient costs were estimated to be CHF 14.73 Mio. in 2013 and CHF 13.26 Mio. in 2014. T he total expenditure for meniscus derangement in Switzerland was thus estimated to be CHF 71.93 Mio. in 2013 and CHF 67.73 Mio. in 2014 . For the sake of completeness, t he results of the budget impact analysis according to the first patient selection strategy suggested that the total inpatient costs were CHF 59.31 52.30 Mio. in 2014 . Within this set of results , the cost estimations for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 seem ed to be particularly un certain , for two reasons: first, a different DRG coding system (APDRG, not yet SwissDRG) was used until 2010 and 2011. Second, the distribution of patients in 2012, the first year after the introduction of the new DRG coding system (SwissDRG was unrealistic ally high, probably due to misclassifications. The results of the budget impact analysis are in line with th e results reported in a very recent publication of the Swiss Health Observatory (Obsan) .143 Assuming app roximately 14,000 meniscectomies per year and inpatient costs of CHF 4,889 per case, the authors of the Obsan estimated total inpatient costs of CHF 55.6 Mio. in 2016. In the present study, the assumed unit costs were lower (CHF 3,700 ), whereas the estimat ed number of arthroscopic surgeries to the knee were higher (ranging between 15,000 and 16,000). Several reasons may explain these discrepancies. First, the unit costs used in the Obsan report consisted in the mean costs registered by the CSS insurance in 2016. Although it was not clearly stated, these costs may have included cases with private insur ance (and consequently higher costs). Second, the costs estimations also included examinations before and after surgery. The magnitude of these costs was not described, but it is reasonable to assume that this may have also led to higher unit costs per pat ient. Third, the list of CHOP codes used to identify patients undergoing knee arthroscopy in the Obsan report was slightly different if compared to the present work, which included a larger variety of arthroscopic knee interventions. This could explain the higher estimated number of cases. In a recently published observational study investigating the use of arthroscopic meniscal surgery in degenerative knee disease in Switzerland and using administrative claims data of a major Swiss health insurance company , the authors reported that the incidence of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, debridement, and lavage in patients over the age of 40 was 388 per 100,000 Seite 173 person -years in 2012 and 352 per 100,000 person -years in 2015 .2 To identify inpatient surgeries, the CHOP codes 80.6X.10 and 80.86.11 were used, whereas outpatient procedures were identified through TARMED codes (24.5710 and 24.57 00). On average, 68% of all identified patients were inpatients. These numbers are comparable with those found in the present analysis. The Swiss Hospital Statistics 2014 showed that there were 22,156 CHOP codes 80.6X.10 (36% of them reimbursed by the acc ident insurance) and 4,276 CHOP codes 80.86.11 (43% reimbursed by the accident insurance). Considering only the cases that were not reimbursed by the accident insurance (n=16,617) and referring them to the Swiss population over 40 years old in 2014 (n= 4,3 74,989), a rate of 380 per 100,000 person -years could be calculated. The rates for the previous years would be 407 per 100,000 person -years for 2013, 398 per 100,000 person -years for 2012, and 368 per 100,000 person -years for 2011. Incidence rates based on the number of cases identified through the second patient selection strategy ( considering all patients with at least one relevant ICD -10 code and one relevant CHOP code ; see above ) would be 336 per 100,000 person -years in 2014, 358 per 100,000 person -years in 2013, 371 per 100,000 person -years in 2012, 360 per 100,000 person -years in 2011, and 380 per 100,000 person -years in 2010. Thus, the estimated incidence rates as well as the estimated percentage of inpatient cases (72 -80%) were very similar to those reported by Muheim et al . Recently published analyses of the Obsan investigating the frequency of arthroscopic meniscectomy in inpatients (CHOP codes 80.6X.10 and 80.6X.11) showed that the standardized intervention rate in Switzerland was 332 per 100,000 persons in 2013, 311 per 10 0,000 persons in 2014, and 306 per 100,000 persons in 2015 (http://versorgungsatlas.ch/index.php/de/MENK/ ). Again, these numbers are comparable with those reported in this assessment . The number s are a little bit lower , at least partially due to the fact that the incidence in the Obsan analyses was calculated using the Swiss population above 17 years (versus the Swiss population over 40 years in our analyses and in the paper by Muheim et al.). The present budget impact analysis has several strengths: firstly, to identify patients with degenerative knee problems two different approaches were used : i) combining relevant DRG codes with ICD -10 codes and CHOP code s, which led to a very strict selection of the patients and resulted in a too conservative cost estimation. It turned out that due to limited suitability of DRG codes for the purpose of patient identification, given real -life coding practices, and due to s pecific issues resulting from the introduction of the SwissDRG coding system in 2012, this approach yielded results of questionable validity. ii) focussing on a combination of ICD -10 codes and CHOP codes permitted a broader and more accurate selection of p atients, resulting in a more realistic cost estimation. Since the selection in the second approach was independent from DRG codes, it was possible to observe that the number of treated patients seemed to remain stable between 2010 and 2014. Another strengt h was the calculation of total costs of inpatient arthroscopies using two different sources of unit costs: the mean costs per case reported in the diagnosis -related case costs (DRG) statistics and mean costs per case according to different insurance covera ge estimated by the insurance company Assura. One limitation of the present assessment is the identification of eligible inpatients, as already addressed above. Three different coding systems (DRG, ICD -10, and CHOP) were used. The analyses suggested that many patients classified with a relevant DRG code or receiving a relevant ICD-10 diagnosis did not receive any arthroscopic intervention (CHOP code). Inversely, some Seite 174 patients undergoing an arthroscopic intervention were not classified or diagnosed accordin gly. It could be interesting to investigate whet her additional selection strategies might be possible, beyond the two strategies discussed above. A further limitation concerns the calculation of ambulatory arthroscopy costs, where the total number of arthr oscopic interventions was available, but the effective costs per patient were not known (e.g. , costs of the consultation, costs of the attending physicians, costs of the patient record, costs for medication or costs for anaesthesia were not available). For the cost calculation , an estimate from an insurance company was used . 83 84 However, it is not clear which costs exactly were included in this estimate . Moreover, the proportion of arthroscopic interventions performed due to trauma was unknown. An additional limitation concerns the assumption of the percentage of cases covered by an accident ins urance in the ambulant setting. The available data did not provide a differentiation between accident and non -accident cases. For this reason, we used the same percentage as for the Swiss Hospital Statistics. A further limitation concerns the representabi lity of the Assura estimation for the entire country. Assura has around one million clients in Switzerland, and according to their reports the Swiss -German portfolio is now as big as the French portfolio. Whether the overrepresentation of French speaking c lients may have led to biased cost estimates is not clear since the methods used to calculate the average costs per patient were not reported in detail. An additional limitation affecting the cost estimates for both inpatients and ambulatory patients conce rns the lack of information about costs occurring before and after surgery. For example, before opting for a surgical intervention, patients may receive physical therapies or pain medication. Similarly, after surgery patients usually require specific rehab ilitation treatments and pain medications. Depending on the severity of the disease and on patient condition (including health status and motivation), the number and costs of additional therapies could be substantial and quite variable between patients . Finally, it should be remembered that with the available information it was not possible to investigate into total annual costs from a societal perspective. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the total costs from a societal perspective would be much higher than direct medical costs alone : patients undergoing arthroscopic knee interventions are often unable to work for several weeks. Therefore, indirect costs related to loss of productivity are potentially very high. A final remark concerns the rationality of arthroscopic interventions to the knee. According to published analyses of Obsan, there is a very large variation in the frequency of arthroscopies between different Swiss cantons ( Figure 49, http://versorgungsatlas.ch/index.php/de/MENK/ ). For example, in 2015, the incidence rate of arthroscopic meniscectomy in the Can tons of Geneva and Vaud was below 184 per 100,000 persons, whereas the incidence rate in the Cantons of St. Gallen, Schwyz, Appenzell Innerrhoden was above 452 per 100,000 persons. Seite 175 Figure 49 Incidence of arthroscopic meniscectomy by Swiss Canton in 2015 (Source: OBSAN/ISPM 2017) 5.3 Joint discussion The assessment of clinical effectiveness and the health economic analysis were based on separate systematic reviews, i.e. the health economic analysi s was not a de novo modelling based on data from the review of clinical effectiveness. The joint discussion focuse s mainly on the similarities and discrepancies between clinical effectiveness and health economic analysis. PICO 2 (inpatient versus outpatien t setting ) will not be addressed in the joint discussion because limited evidence was found in both the clinical effectiveness and the health economic analyses. For the assessment of the clinical effectiveness of arthroscopy in patients with degenerative changes of the knee, 21 RCTs (>2000 patients) were identified. There is no evidence that patients with degenerative knee benefit from therapeutic arthroscopy and it remains unclear whether knee arthroscopy has an effect on the assessed outcomes. Only two o f the 21 RCTs, which were identified for the clinical effectiveness assessment, were used in two of the four identified cost - effectiveness studies. Of the other 19 RCTs, four more (FIDELITY, Herrlin 2007, Gauffin 2014, Kise 2008) reported on quality of lif e but cost -effectiveness studies did not make use of these results. Marsh 2016 used the results by Kirkley 2008 and concluded that physical therapy was dominant (cost -saving) in comparison with arthroscopy. This is in line with the results of the assessmen t of clinical effectiveness. Losina 2015 reported knee arthroscopy to be dominant (cost -saving), and Seite 176 thus came to an opposite conclusion. Losina 2015 used the MeTeOR RCT as a key clinical data source, but the methodological approaches used and that assumpt ion made by Losina 2015 were insufficiently described and appeared partially problematic. Therefore , the validity of this economic analysis should be considered as uncertain. As the cost -effectiveness analyses by Marsh 2016 and Losina 2015 made use of th e RCTs Kirkley 2008 and MeTeOR, they were central for the discussion of the clinical and health economic assessment . However , these RCTs differed in several aspects : First, Kirkley 2008 recruited patients with radiographic confirmed OA and excluded those with large meniscal tears detected with MRI. Kirkley 2008 was also the only RCT classified into the OA only group in clinical assessment. Still, around 80% of patients received meniscal debridement during arthroscopic intervention. The MeTeO R RCT included only patients with MRI -confirmed meniscal tears, but OA was not required as a selection criterion , hence only around 60% of the MeTeOR RCT population had radiographic confirmed OA. Consequently, the interventions different, i.e. arthros copic lavage and debridement in Kirkley 2008 and meniscectomy in MeTeOR. Irrespective of intentions, both RCTs represent mixed populations of OA and DMK, which underlines everyday clinical practice, where a clear distinction between OA and DMK is usually not made. Second, Kirkley 2008 reported that none of the patients crossed -over, whereas MeTeOR reported that over 35% of the population crossed -over from physical t herapy to arthroscop y. In Losina 2015, the authors call this population \"delayed arthroscopic partial meniscectomy\" and the analytical approach in this part of the study may be particularly problematic. The analytical approach in this part of the study may be particularly problematic. M ost of the RCTs did not report on cross -over or post -randomisation arthroscopy. However, some RCTs reported cross -over to be substantial. For instance, Forster 2003 and Herrlin 2007 reported cross -over rates in the comparator group of almost 30%. High cross -over rates with ITT analysis increase the risk of type 2 errors; consequently, a potential benefit of arthroscopy might be underestimated. To what extent cross -overs have affected the effect estimates of the present assessment is unclear. There were two RCTs that reported small cross -over rate s, one of them was blinded (sham -surgery) (FIDELITY) ; both RCTs (FIDELITY, Kirkley 2008) reported no greater benefit by arthroscopic treatment than the other RCTs. Still, given a substantial amount of cross -over in several of the identified RCTs, it cannot be ruled out that arthroscopic surgery may be a clinically and economically sensible option for some groups of patients. Despite the different interventions and different cross -over rates in Kirkley 2008 and MeTeOR, the observed effects in the clinical as sessment were very much alike and did not sufficiently explain the discrepant cost -effectiveness results of Losina 2015 (favouring arthroscopy) and Marsh 2016 (disfavouring arthroscopy) in the health economic analysis. Methodological differences in the app roaches to cost -effectiveness analyses were most likely stronger drivers of the observed discrepancy. In Losina 2015, several methodological aspects are insufficiently reported and some approaches taken may be questionable. The findings of this study are considered very uncertain. Assessment of clinical effectiveness suggested a numerical but no statistically significant effect on disease -specific quality of life in favour of arthroscopy compared to control. This contradicts the very optimistic estimates of QALY gains through arthros copy by Lubowitz 2011 and Hutt 2015. Both the modest QALY gain estimated by Losina 2015 and the small QALY loss estimated by Marsh 2016 may be regarded as consistent with the clinical quality of life findings. Seite 177 Given very limited health economic evidence, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the cost - effectiveness of arthroscopic surgery in patients with degenerative changes of the knee. Although three of four available studies reported arthroscopy to be cost -effective, this cannot be regarded as con vincing, given the methodological issues described and also in light of the results of the assessment of effectiveness.

As eight of the 10 patients in the pilot RCT had posttraumatic osteoarthritis, the outcomes were not pooled with othe r RCTs . Table 41 shows the reported results of the RCT . Saeed 2015 reported a pain score using the Knee Society Score System before and six months after procedure. Scores can range from zero (severe) to 50 (none) in 10 point increments. Seite 204 Table 42 shows the pain score before and six months after procedure. Kise 2016 reported pain at 3 months using the pain subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) ranging from zero to 100 with higher scores indicating less pain. A mean difference in pain of -1.8 (95% CI [ -7.1, 3.5]) was reported favouring the arthroscopy group compared to the comparator group. One RCT (Chang 1993) reported pain improvement defined as 1 cm decrease on 10 cm pain subscale of AIMS at 3.

A mean difference in pain of 1.4 (95% CI [ -3.9, 6.8]) was reported favouring the comparator group compared to the arthroscopy group. Two RCTs (Chang 1993, Yim 2013) reported pain improvement or relief as binary outcomes at an intermediate follow -up time. Chang 1993 reported pain improvement defined as 1 cm decrease on 10 cm pain su bscale of AIMS at 12 months. In the arthroscopy groups, 56% of patients improved, while in the comparator group, 43% of patients improved at 12 months. In Yim 2013, complete relief of pain was defined as a value of zero or one point on the VAS, while impro ved pain was >2 point decrease on the VAS. In the arthroscopy group, 68% and 26% of patients reported complete and improved pain relief, respectively, at 24 months follow -up, while 67% and 23% of patients in the comparator group reported complete and impro ved pain, respectively. 8.4.2 Function 8.4.2.1 Short -term Kise 2016 reported function at 3 months using the activities of daily living subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) ranging from zero to 100 with higher scores indicating better physical function. A mean difference in function of 1.4 (95% CI [ -3.0, 5.9]) was reported favouring the comparator group compared to the arthroscopy group. The MeTeOR RCT defined treatment success as 8 point d ecrease on function subscale of WOMAC with no cross -over. At six months, 108 of 161 patients in t he arthroscopy group had treatment success compared to the 74 of 169 patients in the comparator group. Seite 206 8.4.3 Global assessment 8.4.3.1 Short -term Two RCTs (Chang 1993, KIVIS) reported global assessment as a binary outcome at short -term follow -up. Chang 1993 reported both physician global assessment using a 4 -point ordinal scale and a patient global assessment using a VAS.

A hospitalized patient receives one Swiss DRG (main reason for hospitalization), but h e can receive multiple ICD -10 codes (primary diagnosis and secondary diagnoses) and multiple CHOP codes (main treatment and secondary treatments). Consequently, a patient classified with a Swiss DRG code that has nothing to do with meniscus problems may st ill receive a knee -related diagnosis or treatment. Table 48 shows if and how many knee related diagnoses were assigned to cases with the relevant Swiss DRG codes in 2014. Up to 41% (9,202 out of 22,665) of the hospitalized cases classified with one relevant Swiss DRG code didn't receive an ICD-10 code indicating a diagnosis of meniscus derangement. Only for the Swiss DRG code I18B \" Arthroscopy, incl. biopsy or other interventions on bone or joints, age > 15 years\" there was a clear majority of persons who received a diagnosis for knee/meniscus derangement (9,247 ou t of 11,361, 81%). This suggests that many patients hospitalized with a Swiss DRG code for knee problems did not necessarily receive a meniscus related diagnosis based on ICD -10. Inversely, o nly 13,463 of the 26,290 (51%) cases that received one or more I CD-10 diagnoses for meniscus derangement were automatically identifiable through relevant Swiss DRG codes.

Around 37 % (8,3 11 of 2 2,665) of the cases that were registered with a relevant Swiss DRG code did not receive any knee arthroscopic surgery based on CHOP codes. Only for the Swiss DRG code I18B \"Arthroscopy, incl. biopsy or other interventions on bone or joints, age > 15 years\", there was a clear majority of persons who underwent a knee arthroscopic surgery (10,349 out of 11,361, 91%). Consequently, many patients hospitalized with knee problems didn't necessarily receive an arthroscopic knee surgery according to the CHOP codes. Out of 29,859 cases that received at least one arthroscopic knee surgery accordin g to CHOP codes in 2014, only 14,354 (48%) were classified with a relevant Swiss DRG code. Inversely, 4,499 cases that, according to one or several CHOP codes, received an arthroscopic knee treatment were classified with other Swiss DRG codes.

Only 8% of the cases (2,766 out of 32,625) that underwent an arthroscopic knee surgery according to CHOP codes did not receive an ICD -10 d iagnosis for meniscus derangement. In contrast, 19% (6,335 out of 32,625) of the cases that received an ICD -10 diagnosis for meniscus derangement did not receive any arthroscopic knee surgery according to CHOP codes.
