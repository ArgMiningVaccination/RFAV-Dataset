Today, the increasing xenobiotic onslaught upon our world requires a more extended approach. The Milieu Series of remedies was eclectically and thoughtfully crafted to provide a more global understanding of a case picture. The addition of complementary tonification factors assist in preparing the body for deeper, safe detoxification. Each remedy provides gentle drainage and tonification, without causing the immediate release of cellular toxins, which can create additional complications for BioToxicosis and Homotoxicological processes. A blend of low potentized, ascending homeopathic glands and hormones combine elegantly with Spagyric botanicals, polychrests, cell salts and flower essences to complete the case picture and ensure a well measured and proportionate response. Western-approach clinicians report successful integration of the Milieu drainage and tonification remedies in acute situations related to the organ or causal chain indicated. TCM practitioners find that drainage remedies nourish the blood, chi, yin and yang. Similar results are reported in healing arts' approaches around the world, although with different \"poetry\", including Ayurveda, South American traditional medicine, etc. These unique remedies work exceptionally well in opening up conditions that are stuck or potentially cloaked. The process of detoxification refers to techniques used to assist in the movement of stored toxins from the extracellular spaces of the liver, colon, etc. Detoxification methods can be quite helpful, but often provide only temporary benefit as they do not address the intracellular toxins accumulated throughout the body. Homeopathic drainage is the only method capable of permanently removing toxins from inside living cells. While detoxification does not involve tonification of the weakened systems, drainage remedies are able to provide support and improved functioning to sluggish or weakened systems in the body. This is critical for recovery from chronic illness or stuck or \"cloaked\" conditions. Drainage remedies encourage the release of unhealthy substances at the point of focal interference. Instead of attempting to activate a whole body system to release stored toxins, they encourage the body to let go of unhealthy substances in the specific target areas where they are being retained. Drainage remedies are to be very gentle and do not elicit a worsening of symptoms or a \"healing crisis\". The Lymph BioToxicosis remedies (Lymph 1, 2, & 3) were designed for systemic drainage and as bio-directional indicators.Drainage Milieu was designed to work directly with drainage elements related to specific cells and organs that require additional mesenchymal assistance in order to fully drain. It is particularly effective in the case where typical drainage remedies are either partially or completely ineffective. In cases requiring additional drainage, it is not unusual for practitioners to recommend a BioToxicosis Lymph remedy along with Drainage Milieu as part of a total protocol which also includes botanical, homeopathic and nutritional remedies.
