Pain, swollen limbs, edema and inflammation after a seemingly minor injury? These could be signs of a condition known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). Acupuncture and TCM can help relieve chronic pain due to CRPS. [CRPS](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/complex-regional-pain-syndrome) is a relatively rare condition that usually causes pain and [inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) in an arm or leg. It most often occurs after someone experiences an injury to a limb, or has surgery on one of their limbs. The painful area may be swollen, turn red and hot sometimes, and blue and cold at other times. CRPS is marked by [pain that seems disproportionate](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/reflex-sympathetic-dystrophy-syndrome/) to the injury or outside stimulus. For example, a person with CRPS may feel severe pain when the affected area is touched lightly, or when a breeze blows. While CRPS is not fully understood by medical science, it is generally considered to be a neurological disorder. While most cases of CRPS do improve in the long run, there may be a long period of time during which the injured area seems to be getting more inflamed. CRPS pain may worsen and spread to involve more of the affected limb. In some cases, the pain may even be \"mirrored\" in the opposite limb. This is partially why CRPS is theorized to be caused by problems with the nervous system. Sometimes CRPS manifests without any evidence of nerve damage. This condition is known as CRPS-I, or [Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/brain-and-nerves/chronic-pain/types/rsds.html). (RSD or RSDS). Some cases of CRPS can be associated with proven nerve damage; this is called \"causalgia,\" or CRPS-II. Conventional Western medicine approaches primarily focus on managing symptoms with pain medications and physical therapy. In some cases, CRPS pain can be so severe that it causes disability, as the person cannot use their limb normally in daily activities. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and acupuncture can help address the root causes of CRPS. Acupuncture and TCM offer a holistic approach to relieve pain and enhance overall well-being. Top 5 Symptoms of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) CRPS symptoms can change. A CRPS flare up may last days or weeks, when pain and swelling get worse. Sometimes, the pain may seem to come out of nowhere; other times, it may be triggered by exertion, stress, or other factors. - Intense and prolonged pain: Individuals with CRPS experience severe and persistent pain that may seem disproportionate to the initial injury or cause. There may be \"pins and needles\" or a burning sensation. Light contact with something may cause severe pain; this phenomenon is known as \"allodynia.\" Or something that would usually cause mild pain, like a pin prick, causes severed pain; this is called \"hyperalgesia.\" - Changes in skin temperature and color: The affected area may become warmer or cooler compared to the surrounding areas, and skin may appear blotchy, pale, red, or blue or gray. - Swelling and sensitivity: Swelling, edema, and increased sensitivity to touch or even a slight breeze are common symptoms of CRPS. - Limited range of motion: Stiffness, muscle weakness, and difficulty moving the affected limb or body part may occur. There may be tremors or jerky motions of the limb. - Changes in skin texture, hair and nail growth: Abnormal hair and nail growth patterns, such as excessive hair growth or brittle nails, may develop in the affected area. The skin may become thinner or thicker, or may be shiny or scaly. CRPS may cause unusually heavy sweating in the affected area, or cause there to be a total absence of sweating in the area. Medical Treatment for CRPS In the realm of conventional medicine, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is understood as a multifaceted condition that often arises following an injury or trauma to a limb or body part. While the exact cause of CRPS is not fully understood, it is believed to involve abnormal responses of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Nerve damage, inflammation, and changes in blood flow are thought to play a role in the development of CRPS. Certain risk factors may increase an individual's susceptibility to the condition, such as a history of fractures, surgery, or repetitive motion injuries. Additionally, psychological factors and genetic predisposition may contribute to the development of CRPS. CRPS can be triggered by a variety of factors, including surgery, immobilization, infections, emotional stress and trauma. Diagnostic testing for CRPS may include a bone scan, x-rays, MRI, and a sweat production test. Medications recommended may include pain relievers, corticosteroids to help bring down inflammation, and nerve blocking injections. Low doses of ketamine are sometimes used to help relieve pain. Topical analgesics may help reduce sensitivity in the affected area, as may heat therapy. Other [therapies for CRPS](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crps-complex-regional-pain-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371156) may include biofeedback and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Mirror therapy, in which a person stands or sits in front of a mirror set-up that tricks the brain into thinking it sees the injured limb working the way the healthy limb does, can be helpful for retraining the nervous system. Acupuncture treatment for CRPS can work on multiple levels to help relieve pain, improve motor function, reduce inflammation, help heal nerves, and reduce stress. Can Acupuncture Help CRPS? In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is understood as a disruption in the flow of Qi (energy) and Blood in the affected area, leading to pain and dysfunction. According to TCM theory, the underlying causes of CRPS are often related to the stagnation of Qi and Blood, as well as the blockage of meridians (energy channels) that run through the affected limb or body part. TCM treatments aim to restore the smooth flow of Qi and Blood, harmonize the body's internal balance, and alleviate pain. Acupuncture, a key component of TCM, is believed to stimulate specific acupoints along the meridians, helping to regulate the nervous system's response and promote healing. Chinese herbal medicine is also commonly used in TCM to support the treatment of CRPS by addressing underlying imbalances and promoting overall well being. By addressing both the physical and energetic aspects of the condition, TCM aims to restore harmony and alleviate pain in individuals with CRPS. [One study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23113454/) looked at two soldiers whose upper extremities were injured in combat and were later diagnosed with CRPS. When conventional methods did not help relieve pain, they were given one or two acupuncture treatments per week for a few weeks. They had 80% improvement in pain and functionality and with no recurrence at a 20-month follow up. An individual [case study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21208130/) of a 34-year-old with CRPS showed improvement in pain and emotional well-being after a series of acupuncture treatments. When dealing with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), incorporating certain lifestyle changes, behavioral adjustments, dietary modifications, and home remedies can be beneficial in managing the condition. Here are some recommendations: Stress Management: Practicing stress-reducing techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, and mindfulness can help alleviate CRPS symptoms. Stress management techniques promote relaxation and can positively impact pain perception. - Gentle Exercise: Engaging in low-impact exercises like walking, swimming, or yoga can help improve blood circulation, maintain joint flexibility, and reduce muscle stiffness. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional or physical therapist to determine the most appropriate exercise program for your specific situation. - Heat and Cold Therapy: Applying heat packs or cold compresses to the affected area may provide temporary relief from pain and inflammation. Experiment with both methods to see which works best for you. Remember to protect your skin and avoid extreme temperatures. - Balanced Diet: Maintaining a healthy and well-balanced diet is crucial for overall well-being. Include nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid excessive consumption of processed foods, refined sugars, and caffeine, as they may contribute to inflammation and worsen symptoms. - Adequate Hydration: Staying hydrated is important for promoting optimal bodily function and supporting overall health. Aim to drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day to keep your body hydrated and support proper circulation. - Stress Reduction: CRPS symptoms can be exacerbated by stress. Engaging in activities that promote relaxation, such as hobbies, listening to soothing music, spending time in nature, or engaging in creative outlets, can help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. - Sleep Hygiene: Getting sufficient and quality sleep is essential for managing chronic pain conditions. Establish a regular sleep routine, create a comfortable sleep environment, and practice good sleep hygiene habits like avoiding electronic devices before bed. It's important to note that these lifestyle changes, behavioral adjustments, dietary modifications, and home remedies should complement your comprehensive treatment plan and be tailored to your individual needs. Consult with a healthcare professional or a qualified practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for personalized guidance and recommendations based on your specific condition and symptoms.

[ How to Treat Hiatal Hernia With Acupuncture and TCM acid Chest pain or abdominal pain? Vomiting blood, black stool, dark poop? These can be hiatal hernia symptoms. Acupuncture and TCM offer an adjunct or alternative hernia treatment to help relieve hernia pain. A hernia is what happens when an organ, usually in the abdomen or groin area, pushes through the muscle tissue that surrounds it. A hiatal hernia occurs when the stomach pushes through the diaphragm\u2014the large muscle that separates your abdomen from your chest. There is a small opening in the diaphragm\u2014called the \"hiatus\"\u2014 that allows the esophagus to pass through the muscle wall before it connects to the stomach. When a [hiatal hernia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiatal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373379) occurs, the upper part of the stomach pushes through that opening. It is possible to have a mild hernia and not know it, as it may not cause any pain or other hernia symptoms. A more serious hiatal hernia, though, will cause stomach acid and undigested food to move back up into the esophagus, causing [heartburn](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acid-reflux-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and possibly chest pain or abdominal pain. Sometimes it is possible to actually see a hernia, as it may [bulge](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2017/12/battling-bulging-hernia#:~:text=The%20first%20sign%20of%20a,of%20an%20area%20of%20weakness.) out of the abdomen. Sometimes you can only see it when you cough, or do something strenuous, or even simply stand up. Hiatal Hernia Symptoms The most common signs of hiatal hernia include: - Heartburn and acid reflux: One of the most common symptoms of a hiatal hernia is a burning sensation in the chest due to the regurgitation of stomach acid into the esophagus. - Chest pain: Some people with a hiatal hernia may experience chest pain that can mimic the symptoms of a heart attack. The pain is often described as a dull, squeezing, or pressure-like sensation. - Difficulty swallowing: A hiatal hernia can lead to a narrowing of the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. Individuals may feel a sensation of food getting stuck or feel like they're choking. - Belching and hiccups: burping or persistent hiccuping can occur, due to pressure on the diaphragm. - Regurgitation: In addition to heartburn, people with a hiatal hernia may experience the backflow of food or sour liquid into the mouth. - Chest discomfort after eating: Some people may experience a burning sensation, pressure, or feeling of fullness in the chest area after eating, because the stomach is pressing into the chest cavity. - Shortness of breath: Larger hiatal hernias can put pressure on the diaphragm and lungs, leading to difficulty breathing, especially during physical exertion. - Fatigue and weakness: Chronic symptoms of a hiatal hernia can disrupt sleep, resulting in [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Hiatal hernias are quite [common](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15757-hernia); they may affect as many as half of all people over 50. Hernias may happen because of a generally weakening of muscle tissues. Hernias can also occur because of some trauma or injury to the area; some hernias happen after a surgical procedure, due to incisions or scar tissue. It is also possible to develop a hernia during pregnancy or after giving birth. In many cases, hernia surgery is considered necessary to treat a hernia that is causing symptoms. Acupuncture and TCM treatment offer a way to treat hiatal hernias that may, in some cases, help people avoid a hernia operation. Top 10 Types of Hernia While hiatal hernia and [inguinal hernia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470204/#:~:text=The%20inguinal%20canal%20is%20a,to%20six%20centimeters%20in%20length.) are the most common types of hernia, there are several other types of hernia, classified mainly according to where in the body they occur. - Hiatal Hernia: a portion of the stomach protrudes through the diaphragm into the chest cavity, often leading to symptoms like heartburn, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing. - Inguinal Hernia: Inguinal hernias are the most common type and occur when part of the intestine or abdominal tissue pushes through a weak spot or tear in the lower abdominal wall, often in the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal acts as a passageway for the round ligament of the uterus in women and for the gonadal vessels in men. Inguinal hernias are more common in men and may cause a bulge or swelling in the groin or scrotum. - Umbilical Hernia: Umbilical hernias occur when the tissue or intestines protrude through a weak spot near the navel (belly button). This type of hernia is more common in infants but can also occur in adults, especially those who are overweight or have had multiple pregnancies. - Ventral Hernia: Ventral hernias develop in the abdominal wall, often at the site of a previous surgical incision. They can occur when the tissue or intestines push through weakened abdominal muscles, causing a bulge or protrusion. - Epigastric Hernia: Epigastric hernias appear in the upper abdomen, between the navel and the breastbone. They occur when fatty tissue pushes through weak areas in the abdominal muscles, resulting in a small bump or bulge. - Groin Hernia or Femoral Hernia: This term is often used to refer to inguinal hernias, which are the most common type of groin hernia. However, it can also encompass other hernias that occur in the groin area, such as femoral hernias. Femoral hernias can sometimes happen due to straining while having a bowel movement. - Spigelian Hernia: Spigelian hernias are relatively rare and occur along the edge of the abdominal wall, typically below the navel. These hernias may be difficult to diagnose due to their location and can cause pain and discomfort. - Incisional Hernia: An incisional hernia occurs at the site of a previous surgical incision, where the tissue or intestines protrude through the weakened area. It is more common in individuals who have undergone abdominal surgery. - Diaphragmatic Hernia: Diaphragmatic hernias occur when abdominal organs, such as the stomach or intestines, protrude through a defect in the diaphragm. This type of hernia can be congenital or acquired and may cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing and chest pain. - Sports Hernia: Also known as [athletic pubalgia](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/sports-hernia-athletic-pubalgia/), a sports hernia refers to soft tissue injuries or tears in the groin area, specifically affecting the muscles, tendons, or ligaments. It is commonly associated with sports that involve sudden twisting movements, such as soccer or hockey. Another type of hernia can occur in the back part of the body. You have probably also heard of a \" [herniated disc.](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-herniated-disc-with-acupuncture-tcm/)\" This condition, which is also known herniation that occurs between the spinal vertebrae. There are discs made of cartilage that sit between the vertebrae, which provide cushioning. Sometimes, when there is damage to outer layers of these discs, the gel-like substance that is inside oozes out, breaching the outer wall. This type of hernia can put pressure on the nerves of the spinal column, causing pain. Hernia Treatment When a person seeks medical care for a suspected hernia, the diagnostic process typically involves first a physical exam; the doctor will check for swelling or a bulge in the abdomen or groin. Imaging tests, including X-rays or endoscopy, can help a physician see where there is a hernia, and how severe it is. Initial treatment for hiatal hernia may be conservative, and involve monitoring and making lifestyle changes such as avoiding spicy foods and elevating the upper body during sleep. Pharmacological solutions might involve antacids, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers, which reduce the production of stomach acids. If these methods do not resolve symptoms of heartburn and reflux, then hernia surgery may be recommended. The most common type of hernia operation is called Nissen fundoplication, which involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophagus to reinforce the lower esophageal sphincter and prevent acid reflux. In some cases, minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopic hernia repair, may be used to reduce recovery time and minimize scarring. Acupuncture and TCM may, in some cases, offer an alternative treatment for hiatal hernia that can help relieve pain, heartburn, and regurgitation. Can Acupuncture Help Hiatal Hernia? According to TCM theory, abdominal hernias usually occur due to an imbalance in the middle or lower jiao. The [three jiaos](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/san-jiao) are sometimes referred to or translated as the \"triple burner,\" which illustrates how they keep the center of the body warm and nourished. In TCM, the upper jiao, [middle jiao, and lower jiao](https://www.tmrjournals.com/public/articlePDF/20201203/ccaf19d7c1df3e47031427b761effa36.pdf) correspond to the visceral structure of the midsection, and each one helps to control and harmonize the organ systems contained within it. The middle jiao houses the spleen, stomach, liver and gallbladder, while the lower jiao contains the small intestine, large intestine, kidneys, and bladder. In Chinese Medicine, heat, cold, dampness, and dryness can be considered pathogenic forces that can cause problems. If there is an [accumulation of cold](https://acupuncturetoday.com/article/33954-hernias-cold-middle-and-lower-jiao) or damp in the upper or lower abdomen, it can cause muscle weakness that leads to the formation of a hernia. The middle jiao and lower jiao help keep fluids balanced in the abdomen. If the jiaos are not functioning well, then [muscle weakness](https://www.bioessence.com/home/topicdetail/100018) may be the result. Stagnant Qi can also be a factor. Acupuncture treatment helps to strengthen Qi and get it moving. TCM takes the view that physical, mental, and emotional health are all inextricably linked. Strong emotions and stress can also contribute to the formation of hernias. Repressed feelings of anger or rage are associated with hiatal hernia. It is as if a person is swallowing those feelings, but the body rebels to force them back up. Acupuncture treatment can help address the effects of prolonged stress and emotional upset. Finding stress relief and relaxation can have a significant effect on the central nervous system, the muscles of the abdomen, and the diaphragm. Both acupuncture treatment and [Chinese herbs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7378538/) can help to reduce acid reflux and GERD symptoms. If a hernia is severe, then a hernia operation may be required. In these cases, acupuncture and herbs can still help with the healing process. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3546210/) showed that electroacupuncture treatment helped to relieve postoperative pain for patients who had undergone hernia surgery. Regular acupuncture treatment can help to prevent the recurrence of reflux, while helping to reduce the physical effects of emotional stress. Acupuncture Near Me for Hiatal Hernia in Los Angeles TCM is an excellent modality for helping to relieve both gastrointestinal disorders and muscular problems. In some cases, a hiatal hernia is a serious mechanical problem that requires surgical intervention. However, in many cases, hernias can be relieved with changes in lifestyle that will help to reduce acid and relieve stress. Acupuncture is worth considering as an adjunct or alternative hernia treatment. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Appendicitis With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-appendicitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Sudden pain right lower abdomen or pain that starts around your navel? Nausea or vomiting? These may be appendicitis symptoms. Appendix pain is a sign of appendicitis, or an infected and inflamed appendix. Acupuncture and TCM offer an adjunct treatment for appendicitis that can help relieve appendicitis pain. The appendix is a small, tube-shaped organ that extends off of the lower part of the large intestine. What side is your appendix on? The [appendix location](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459205/) is in the lower right quadrant of your abdomen. What's appendicitis? [Appendicitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493193/) causes are generally related to infection and [inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/). The appendix can become blocked by a bacterial infection, a viral infection, a parasite, or a tumor. Sometimes fecal matter gets into the appendix, causing a blockage. [If the appendix](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8095-appendicitis) becomes infected and inflamed, it can swell and even rupture; this is often called a \"burst appendix,\" or ruptured appendix. If the appendix becomes so swollen that it begins to tear or rupture, stool can leak out into your abdominal area and cause [peritonitis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/appendicitis), a potentially very dangerous infection. Acute appendicitis is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Studies have shown that acupuncture and TCM treatment can help relieve appendicitis pain and swelling and [improve outcomes](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/2006-acupuncture-and-herbs-appendicitis-relief-discovery) for patients hospitalized for acute appendicitis. Appendicitis Symptoms The [signs of appendicitis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/appendicitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369543) often come on over a short period of time, usually beginning with a sudden pain in the middle of your belly around your navel, and then moving to the lower right side of your abdomen. Appendicitis symptoms include: - Sudden pain near or around the navel that migrates to the lower right side - Sudden pain in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen - Pain in belly is worse when you cough or are jarred - Right belly is tender to the touch [Constipation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-constipation-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Urinary frequency or urinary urgency - No appetite - Low grade fever - Malaise, generally feeling ill Appendicitis tends to develop through a series of stages. The 4 [stages of appendicitis](https://www.verywellhealth.com/stages-of-appendicitis-7099234) are: - Early or uncomplicated appendicitis, which is when a blockage has formed and swelling of the appendix begins. At this stage, the pain in the middle of the belly area may be just sort of a vague \"stomach ache.\" - The appendix begins to fill with mucus. Without proper blood and lymph drainage, bacteria begin to proliferate inside the appendix. - The swelling begins to make the tissue of the appendix and the surrounding intestine and bowel walls become stiff, sometimes forming an inflamed mass, which is called an \"appendiceal phlegmon.\" This can feel like a hard mass in the lower right abdomen when palpated. - Blocked blood flow causes a lack of oxygen, so the tissues of the appendix become necrotic. At this stage, the wall of the appendix can begin to tear or rupture. This process usually develops over the course of 12-24 hours. This is why appendicitis is considered a medical emergency. It is very important that anyone experiencing this type of pain and other symptoms seeks urgent care. Appendicitis Treatments and Appendectomy Upon being admitted for testing, a person presenting with severe pain in the right abdomen will first need to undergo testing to be sure of a diagnosis of appendicitis. There are several other conditions which could also cause abdominal pain in this area, including: [Crohn's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-crohns-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Mittelschmerz, [ovulation pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ovulation-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) ruptured - Ovarian torsion [Endometriosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - Ectopic pregnancy - Pelvic inflammatory Testicular torsion - Right-sided [colitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-colitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Kidney stone](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) While undergoing diagnostic testing such as MRI, CT-scan, or ultrasound, it is often [common practice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1070812/) for doctors not to administer pain medications, the idea being that to do so might mask symptoms and delay proper diagnosis. This when acupuncture treatment can be particularly helpful. Acupuncture can have a proven analgesic effect for abdominal pain, without any side effects. In general, appendix surgery is considered the gold standard treatment for acute appendicitis. Appendix removal can be done laparoscopically, or via incision. Some cases of appendicitis may be treated with antibiotics and other medications over the course of several days or weeks, but often, in a significant number of cases, the appendicitis recurs. Acupuncture and Chinese herbs can serve as an [adjunct treatment](https://www.nccaom.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Acupuncture-and-Herbs-Appendicitis-Relief-Discovery.pdf) for appendicitis patients, helping to relieve abdominal pain, regulate body temperature, and reduce inflammation. Can Acupuncture Help Appendix Pain? Appendicitis is an emergency situation, and people should definitely seek immediate medical care if they are experiencing right side abdominal pain and fever. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can be used as complementary medicine, to help reduce hospitalization time and improve overall outcomes of conventional treatment for appendicitis. While in some cases, appendicitis surgery may be necessary, there are other options. In some cases a combination of antibiotics to handle the infection, and acupuncture, herbs and moxibustion treatment to help relieve pain and inflammation may help to resolve appendicitis without surgery. This is known as NOTA: non-operative treatment for acute appendicitis. According to TCM theory, appendicitis is considered to be related to blood stasis and stagnant Qi, as indicated by symptoms like: distended abdomen, nausea and/or vomiting, and a red tongue with a white, greasy coating. If the condition is also characterized by excess heat, then there may also be intense pain and muscle tension in the lower right abdomen, constipation, fever, a dry mouth, and dark-colored urine. In [this situation](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1717-acupuncture-emergency-help-for-appendicitis#:~:text=Patients%20receiving%20only%20drug%20therapy,added%20to%20the%20treatment%20protocol.), an acupuncturist would use acupuncture points targeting the stomach, spleen, and large intestine to help move blood, Qi, and clear heat from the infected area.

[ How to Treat Gallbladder Pain With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-gallbladder-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Ph.D. Ph.D. Pain on right side abdomen? Sudden, sharp right abdomen pain? This could be a sign of a gallstone or gallbladder issue. Gallbladder attacks can cause severe gallbladder pain. Acupuncture and TCM can provide an alternative or adjunct treatment for gallstones symptoms. The gallbladder is a small organ located on the right side of your abdomen, under the liver. The liver produces bile, a liquid that helps break down fats into fatty acids. The gallbladder stores bile and releases it into the small intestine as needed, to help with digestion. When the bile that your body produces has too much cholesterol or bilirubin in it, or when bile is not draining out of the gallbladder properly, it can become too concentrated and begin to harden into a solid. Gallbladder pain usually occurs because a person has [gallstones](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gallstones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354214), which are just what they sound like: little stones that develop inside the gallbladder and are made up mostly of cholesterol. The medical term for gallstones is \" [cholilithiasis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/7313-gallstones).\" Many people have gallstones and are not aware of it. It is possible to have gallstones with no symptoms at all. Top 5 Gallstone Symptoms People who have gallbladder disease or gallstones are likely to experience a condition known as \"biliary colic.\" This means that they have an intolerance for fatty foods and may experience dyspepsia, nausea, and/or [bloating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) when they eat something that disagrees with them. Severe, sharp right side stomach pain is the most common sign of a gallbladder attack, which is when a gallstone becomes lodged in one of the small tubes or ducts that lead to and from the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Gallbladder symptoms may include: - Pain in lower right abdomen - Nausea and/or vomiting - Yellow skin and/or yellow eyes, jaundice - Fever and/or chills - Brown pee, brown urine, light-colored poop Sometimes gallbladder pain can refer to the right shoulder, or between the shoulderblades. [Gallbladder pain](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/23355-gallbladder-pain) can also happen due to inflammation of the gallbladder. This condition is known as cholecystitis and occurs when a gallstone blocks the duct that leads out of the bladder, causing bile and bacteria to build up and become infected. Stones can sometimes become lodged in the common bile duct, which not only causes pain, but can lead to pancreatitis. Gallstones are the primary cause of acute [pancreatitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22982-gallstone-pancreatitis), in which the pancreas becomes irritated and inflamed due to a backup of bile and/or digestive enzymes. The pain of a gallbladder attack is unignorable. If it doesn't go away within a few hours, most people choose to go to the emergency room for urgent care. Gallstones may pass on their own, or drugs are sometimes used to help dissolve the gallstones. These drugs can be expensive, and sometimes cause problems like atherosclerosis, or fatty buildup in the arteries. When gallstone pain comes and goes, and the gallstones are present but not causing the blockage of a duct, usually pain management and patience are the only treatment. If gallbladder issues keep coming up, the typical medical treatment is gallbladder surgery. Acupuncture can offer an alternative treatment to help relieve gallbladder pain. TCM is considered an [effective treatment for biliary colic due](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-021-05356-9) to gallbladder disease. Gallbladder Removal It is very common for people presenting with acute pancreatitis or a gallbladder attack to have a [cholecystectomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448145/), or gallbladder removal. Over 300,000 cholecystectomies are performed in the U.S. each year. While this gallbladder surgery is usually done laparoscopically and is minimally invasive, there are disadvantages to living without a gallbladder. Some people have what is known as [postcholecystectomy syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539902/), in which they continue to experience pain on right side abdomen, heartburn, nausea, indigestion, and vomiting, even though their gallbladder is gone. Some [research studies](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-gallstones-surgery/gallbladders-may-be-removed-too-often-idUSKCN1SF28F) have suggested that gallbladder removal may not be necessary or desirable for everyone. It may be worth considering alternative or adjunct gallbladder pain treatment with TCM and acupuncture. Can Acupuncture Help Gallbladder Symptoms? Chinese medicine has been used to treat gallstones for thousands of years, without surgery. According to TCM theory, the gallbladder is the Yang organ that ideally works cooperatively and in harmony with the Yin liver. The gallbladder is an extraordinary organ in that it is part of the digestive system, but it never comes in direct contact with the food you eat. It stores and secretes bile to help break down fats. In TCM, we consider the gallbladder to represent the part of our nature that makes decisions, takes action, and feels inspired. When the liver and the gallbladder are not functioning smoothly, we may feel frustrated, angry, and depressed. Repressing anger can exacerbate gallbladder problems, as can eating the wrong foods. In TCM, the gallbladder is associated with spring, and the wood element. It is best nourished with lots of dark, leafy greens, herbs, roots, and green tea. Eating too many fatty, fried foods, and drinking too much alcohol can have a very negative effect on both the liver and gallbladder. The stimulation of acupoints along the gallbladder meridian can help to regulate the sphincters of the gallbladder and its action, and help to promote the secretion of bile so that it does not remain stagnant inside the gallbladder. Acupuncture can also have an [analgesic effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8762121/) that may even be superior to that of NSAIDs pain relief medications, without any of the side effects that may occur with regular use of these drugs. Acupuncture can also be used to treat chronic cholecystitis, the chronic inflammation of the gallbladder due to infection. [TCM treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7969282/) can help reduce inflammation and improve immune function so that infections can be more easily fought off. Acupuncture and TCM can also be used as an adjunct treatment to help boost the efficacy of conventional medications. [ One study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1753-acupuncture-soothes-gallbladder-attacks) showed that patients who were given cefodizime for chronic cholecystitis and also received acupuncture had a 98% effective rate, as opposed to patients who received the medication only, who had only a 50% effective rate. There are many Chinese herb preparations designed to help with gallstones. These formulas are based on TCM theories related to clearing the stagnation of Qi and blood in the liver and gallbladder, removing dampness and heat and treating yin deficiency. These [herbs have been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6601506/) to help discharge gallstones, control the metabolism of bilirubin, and help to prevent the formation of new stones in the future.

[ How to Treat Kidney Stones With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-kidney-stones-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. and Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Severe lower back pain, blood in urine, burning pee? These could be signs of kidney stones. Acupuncture and TCM offer an alternative or adjunct kidney stones treatment that can help relieve kidney stone pain and dysuria, or painful urination. Kidney stones are hard mineral deposits that form in the kidneys or other parts of the urinary tract. Salt and minerals can crystallize when urine reaches a certain level of concentration. Often, [kidney stones](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755) form when there are calcium oxalate crystals in urine. Calcium levels can be high because of eating too much sodium. The ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder. If a kidney stone moves into a ureter and becomes lodged there, it can cause left [lower back pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lower-back-pain-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) or right lower back pain. This is known as \"passing a kidney stone.\" [Kidney stones](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidneystones#causes) are very common, and many people go to the ER when they are experiencing severe lower back pain on one side and peeing blood. This happens when one or more kidney stones find their way into one of the ureters and become lodged there. This blocks the flow of urine and can cause severe pain and cramping. Acupuncture can help [reduce kidney stone pain](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/2148-acupuncture-found-effective-for-kidney-stones) in the short term, and help address the imbalances that are the root cause of kidney stones. What Causes Kidney Stones? Kidney stones form when there is not enough urine, and it becomes too concentrated. This often is due to not drinking enough fluids and getting dehydrated. Other kidney stone causes include: - Not drinking enough water, dehydration - Too much salt - Too much sugar, fructose, or high fructose corn syrup - Too much meat, too few fruits and vegetables - Lack of exercise or too much exercise - weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery, which can cause chronic diarrhea - Infections, UTIs - Gout - Chronic [diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)due to [Crohn's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-crohns-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), ulcerative [colitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-colitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Type 2 Diabetes, high blood sugar levels Kidney stones are differentiated into different types, depending on their mineral composition. The types of kidney stones are: - Calcium stones - deposits of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate - Uric acid stones - high levels of uric acid can be due to eating a lot of animal proteins - Struvite stones - can form after a UTI - Cystine stones - cystinuria is an inherited condition that causes buildup of the amino acid cystine in the urinary tract Top 10 Symptoms of Kidney Stones Many people have kidney stones and are not aware of them. It is possible to have [kidney stones without pain](https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-about-kidney-stones/) or kidney stones without urinary symptoms. You may only find out about them when having imaging tests done for some other reason. However, passing a kidney stone can certainly cause intense pain and other upsetting symptoms. The most common signs of kidney stones include: - Sharp pain on one side of the lower back - Cramps in one side - Pain in the lower abdomen or groin - Urgent need to pee, urinary urgency - Peeing a lot, urinary frequency - Burning sensation when peeing, dysuria - Dark urine, blood in urine - Nausea, vomiting - Pain at the tip of the penis - Fever and/or chills Kidney stone pain can range from mild to severe, and it can come and go or be constant. Acupuncture treatment has been shown to be effective for reducing kidney stone pain when used as an [adjunct in emergency medical care](https://www.renalandurologynews.com/home/news/urology/kidney-stones/acupuncture-may-speed-kidney-stone-pain-relief-in-emergency-settings/) settings when someone is waiting for conventional treatment. Treatment for Kidney Stones Kidney stones are [diagnosed](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355759) through blood tests and urine tests, which will show if there is too much uric acid, calcium, or other minerals that can cause stones to form. Imaging tests, such as ultrasound, may be able to detect where stones are stuck in the urinary tract. If a person is passing stones (kidney stones in toilet), they may be analyzed to determine what sort of mineral has formed them. In many cases, people will be encouraged to wait until the stones pass on their own. In this case, simply drinking adequate fluids and using pain medication to manage the intermittent pain and cramping will be recommended. Medications such as alpha blockers (Flomax) may be prescribed to help relax the ureters. If the kidney stones are too large to be passed, then [surgery](https://www.urologyhealth.org/urology-a-z/k/kidney-stones) may be indicated. Procedures using sound waves are sometimes used to help break up the stones. Surgery using small scopes and instruments can also remove the stones. A stent may be placed in the ureter to help keep it open until swelling goes down and it heals. Studies have indicated that a combination of medications like [Flomax and Chinese herbs may help](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1807-acupuncture-and-herbs-force-expulsion-of-kidney-stones) to expel kidney stones. TCM treatment can help prevent the need for surgery. Can Acupuncture and Herbs Help Kidney Stones? According to TCM theory, kidney stones are in the category of \"Shilin\" conditions, in which urination is difficult. [Chinese herbs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7220068/) have traditionally been used to help balance the electrolyte minerals in the body, which helps prevent stones from forming in the urinary tract. TCM treatment for kidney stones includes herbal medicine to help increase urine volume and excretion of minerals and inhibits the formation of calcium crystals. [Acupuncture treatment](https://www.scielo.br/j/ibju/a/pPCZPgCvTRKMr7wwzvTDXLn/?lang=en) has an anesthetic effect which can help relieve the pain of kidney stones while other treatments take effect to help reduce and prevent the formation of new kidney stones. One [trial found](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-021-05600-2) that acupuncture treatment helped relieve kidney stone pain faster than pharmacological medications. Acupuncture treatment has no side effects, while 43% of the people in the study who were given intramuscular anesthesia report side effects like skin rash, irregular heartbeat, and drowsiness. Acupuncture and acupressure can help relieve severe back pain and pelvic pain due to various urinary and other reproductive system conditions. It can also help reduce the anxiety and depression that people sometimes experience when faced with severe pain. How to Prevent Kidney Stones Drinking plenty of water is probably the most important thing you need to do to [prevent](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/kidneystones_prevent) dehydration and low volume of urine. In addition to staying hydrated, you should: - Reduce sodium intake by eating less salt and fewer processed and packaged foods. - Reduce [foods that encourage calcium oxalate](https://www.webmd.com/kidney-stones/kidney-stones-food-causes)stones: meats, berries, beer, black pepper, spinach, chocolate/cocoa, and tea. - Combine calcium-rich foods or drinks with foods that contain oxalate, so that they can be absorbed well together. This could mean eating spinach with cheese, or berries with yogurt. The citrate in citrus juices can also help discourage stone formation. - Add foods with a high ratio of magnesium to calcium, such as: brown rice, oats, barley, bananas, soybeans, and flaxseeds. - Be sure to replace lost fluids when you sweat through exercise or by being in a sauna, steam room, or hot tub, or just by being in the heat during the summertime. - Balance your Ph levels. For some people this may mean increasing alkaline foods.
