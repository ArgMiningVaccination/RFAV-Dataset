COVID-19 is often spread through respiratory droplets and it will first attack the lungs, causing flu-like symptoms. Points To Wellness shares some TCM treatments and lifestyle changes to help combat infections and shore up immune function, especially during this outbreak. 1. TCM Treatments and Essential Oils TCM believes that the Lung is not only responsible for breathing, it also dominates the vital energy (Qi) of the entire body. In order for the Lung to function at its optimum, it needs to receive nutritional Qi from the Spleen. When the Lung function is compromised, the general principle of treating is to identify the underlying disharmony in the organs and release it from the body.

Support the Spleen for Stronger Immunity For a strong immune system, it is important to also adopt a healthy lifestyle to support healing. Here are some TCM tips to boost your immune system: - Avoid raw food and eat warm cooked food. This will ensure the digestive fire is strong and you can better digest and absorb adequate nutrients. - Avoid a diet that is rich in sugar, processed and greasy food. Too much of these can create dampness and hinder the Spleen function. It can also negatively affect the gut microbiome which may cascade into a chronic low-grade inflammation. - Eat more vegetables, fruits, probiotic foods, healthy fats, lean protein and drink adequate amount of warm water. 4.
