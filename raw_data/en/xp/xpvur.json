The Healing Pathway Protocol gives you a structure that is very easy, completely safe and takes the stress away from the practitioner because you will be 100% guided by the wisdom of the client's being. Therefore you need never again be worried about whether you are using the correct approach or correction. IH also gives you the confidence to know that whatever issues/dysfunctions a client presents, you WILL be able to work with them. For the newly qualified kinesiologist: Integrated Healing will instil confidence by adding structure, flow and depth to your balances and by giving you a completely safe system that you can work with immediately after the course, as well as a wide range of tools for your 'tool kit'. For the experienced kinesiologist: The huge benefit of the Integrated Healing approach is that nothing you have learned is redundant. The Healing Pathways Protocol will be a powerful add-on, rather than a replacement, for what you already know and do. You will also find that IH really turns kinesiology into kin-'easy'-ology, by: - Doing away with the need for Hip-and-Jaw stacking - Giving you a percentage display - Using Holographic Recording to capture a constant, more comprehensive stream of the information related to the client's dysfunction, and it's impact on the client's total being, including all dimensions, energy fields and connections to the Universe - Adding Holographic Stress Loading using one of the body's truly holographic systems. This means that the practitioner can capture all relevant information on every dimension of the being within the Hologram. It makes for a faster and more comprehensive and profound balance - Correcting Holographically. Because of the holographic set-up, the correction is done on every aspect of the client's dysfunction/issue and every dimension of the client's being, this means that the likelihood of healing crises is remote - Incorporating the benefits of the NLP toolkit. (See below) Overview Healing Pathways gives you the foundation on which all of Integrated Healing is built. - The Human Hologram and its implications for kinesiologists - A much simpler way of stacking that eliminates the need for hip and jaw stacking - The Healing Pathway Protocol - Root Cause - Origin and Understanding - The Universal Energy Model - The Body's Energy Model - Hands-on Healing Corrections - Holographic Corrections - Clearing Self-Sabotage Program It also includes the 'tools-for-change' used in Neuro-Linguistic Programming to: - Ensure that the client creates a clearly defined outcome - Confirm that the client 'Chooses' their new healed state - Expose any secondary gain programs that may hinder the client's healing - Fill the 'void' that may be left by clearing redundant programs - Make sure that the client 'Owns' their healed state - Test and reinforce the client's 'Knowing and Believing' that healing has taken place "}
