Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument SCOPE OF THI S DOCUMENT 1 ABOUT THE ALBERTA LOW BACK PAIN GUIDELINE This section contains the following information about the Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evidence -Informed Primary Care Management of Low Back Pain , 3rd Edition : Purpose, objectives, and target audience Multidisciplinary committees involved in its development Type and location of guideline and companion documents available to clinicians and patients Conflict of interest , funding, and editorial independence Terms of use Purpose The purpose of the 3rd edition of the Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evidence- Informed Primary Care Management of Low Back Pain (herein referred to as the Alberta CPG ) is to help Alberta clinicians make evidence -informed decisions about the care of adult patients (18 years of age or older) with nonmalignant, nonspecific low back pain. The guideline was written to provide healthcare professionals in community practice and patients in Alberta with guidance about the prevention, assessmen t, and treatment of low back pain. It is expected that providing relevant, up -to-date information to assist primary care practitioners in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of low back pain will allow more patients to be competently managed in the pr imary care setting and decrease unnecessary referrals to increasingly overburdened specialists. Objectives The primary objectives are: to increase the use of evidence -informed conservative approaches to the prevention, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with low back pain in primary care; to promote appropriate specialist referrals and use of diagnostic tests in patients with low back pain; and to encourage patients to engage in appropriate self -care activities. Target Users The guideline is intended to be used by any healthcare provider (e.g., family physician, osteopathic physician, chiropractor, physical therapist, occupational therapist, nurse, pharmacist, or psychologist) in a primary care setting who is responsible for the care of patient s with low back pain.

The first phase of the program (the Ambassador Pilot Project), completed in 2005, used clinical opinion leaders to present evidence to healthcare providers on various treatments for chronic pain.1-4 Funding for the Ambassador Pilot Project was provided by a capacity -building grant from the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technol ogies in Health ( CADTH; formerly known as the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment). The success of the initial Ambassador Program led to additional funding from Alberta Health to expand the scope of the project. The second phase of the program started in 2006 and focused on developing evidence -based, Alberta -specific CPGs for the management of two conditions: low back pain and headache. This second iteration of the Ambassador Program built on the Ambassador Pilot Project, with the aims of: collaborating with local champions to develop locally adapted CPGs for low back pain and headache, to guide clinicians through a sequential process of clinically appropriate treatment options that are available in their region; supporting local ne tworks in disseminating the CPGs to clinicians in Alberta; updating and maintaining the Ambassador Program website ( www.ihe.ca/research - programs/hta/aagap) as a resource for clinicians and patie nts; designing and implementing an appropriate approach for evaluating the impact of the CPGs; exploring strategies for engaging the public in HTA research transfer on the topics of low back pain and headache management.

This involved adapting seven clinical practice guidelines on low back pain into a single guideline that spanned the continuum of care fr om prevention and diagnosis through to treatment. The process used to produce the 1st Edition of the Alberta CPG has been described in more detail elsewhere.5,6 Briefly, the following three multidisciplinary committees were formed comprising participants with clinical, research, and dissemination expert ise (see Appendix C for profiles of each of the committee participants). The SC provided project leadership, guided the collection and collation of research material, provided operational and fiscal oversight, and acted as a se cretariat to the Guideline Development Group (GDG) and the Advisory Committee . The SC was responsible for finalizing and signing off on the guideline. The Advisory Committee provided general project oversight, advised the SC on strategic matters , and provided linkages to appropriate stakeholders. The multidisciplinary GDG constructed the CPG. A Research Team consisting of HTA researchers assisted the SC and GDG by selecting and appraising the published guidelines, preparing background documents, tracking decision points, and helping to write the final guideline. The GDG reviewed all of the background materials (the seven seed guidelines and their companion documents, the evidence inventory tables, and the quality appraisal scores) and drafted an Alberta -specific guideline during 10 half -day meetings (nine via videoconference and one face -to-face) over a 12 -month period. 5,6 The final guideline was posted on the TOP website in March 2009. The guideline was also listed on the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) Infoba se (April 2009) and the United States Department of Health and Human Services National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) (March 2010) websites . Alberta Low Back Pain Guideline 2011 (2nd Edition) Update Process At the completion of the 1st Edition of the Alberta CPG in March 2009, an Update Committee was established to oversee the ongoing review and maintenance of the guideline . The committee included six former members of the GDG with expertise in the field (three physicians, one physical therapist, one pain specialist, and the clinical psychologist who chaired the GDG) plus two new members (one physician and one pharmacist) who had not been involved in the development of the 1 st Edition of the Alberta CPG . TOP , the program responsible for provincial guidelines, and HTA researchers from the IHE were responsible for updating the scientific content of the Alberta CPG . The SC began outlining a schedule and process for updating the guideline in the fall of 2010. A workshop titled \"Encouraging Optimal Use of Diagnostic Imaging for Low Back Pain\" was held on 26 -27 October 2010 7 to explore options for improving the quality of and access to diagnostic imaging services for low back pain in Alberta through the engagement of stakeholders involved in the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and management of low back pain. Users of the Alberta CPG stated that the recommendations related to the use of diagnostic imaging were among the most difficult to implement in primary care practice, and that an updated version of the guideline might benefit from the input of radiologists. Feedbac k from workshop participants indicated the need to update the diagnostic imaging recommendations of the Alberta CPG . 8 Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE I: SET -UP 7 In November 2010, all former GDG and Advisory Committee members were asked to list any primary care assessments and treatments not included in the 1st Edition of the guideline that may be relevant for patients with low back pain. The resulting list of assessments and interve ntions was initially reviewed by the two co-chairs of the Update Com mittee (the clinical psychologist who chaired the GDG and a physician who participated in the GDG) in December 2010, followed by full Update Committee review in January 2011. The process u sed to produce the 2 nd Edition of the Alberta CPG is described in more detail elsewhere.9 The 2nd Edition of the Alberta CPG was posted on the TOP website on 28 November 2011. Set-Up and Planning of the Alberta Low Back Pain Guideline 2015 (3rd Edition) Update Process The Alberta CPG was developed using a hybrid process involving adaptation of seed guidelines supplemented with evidence from published systematic reviews as required. Published literature indicates that the median life span of a de novo guideline is about five years from publication and that updated guidelines have an even shorter life span. 10,11 To maintain the currency of the Alberta CPG, a scoping search of the medical literature is c onducted annually. An update of the CPG is considered necessary when at least two new guidelines of good quality (or updates of previously reviewed seed guidelines) are identified. An update search was conducted in October 2013. On 2 December 2013, the SC and a representative from Alberta Health met to discuss whether an update of the Alberta CPG was required. A summary of the key discussion points follows : The medical literature scoping search identified new published guidelines and updates of seed guidelines. Participants reviewed the new guidelines and their quality scores as well the list of excluded guidelines. At least two new guidelines of good quality had been published since the launch of the Alberta CPG , 2nd Edition, so it was decided to update the guideline. Participants emphasized the need to survey stakeholders for new interventions not included in the 2 nd Edition of the Alberta CPG and discussed the addition of new interventions: radiofrequen cy ablation (identified by Alberta Health) as well as the CORE Back Tool and the STarT Back Tool (identified by the SC). It was noted that an updated Alberta CPG would dovetail with initiatives by the Council of the Federation examining the appropriatenes s of diagnostic imaging in patients with low back pain, headache, or minor head injuries. The SC subsequently met several times over the period from December 2013 to February 2014 to discuss the logistics and approach for updating the Alberta CPG , includ ing recruiting new members for the GUC , potentially developing an app for patients, and involving patients and lay people in the update process. Given the challenge of patient recruitment, the SC decided to canvass patient members of the Chronic Pain Assoc iation of Canada regarding new interventions not currently included in the Alberta CPG , and to have the IHE Lay Advisory Committee review the patient information sheets and brochures. An online survey was created (one for patients and one for clinicians) to inquire about new interventions not currently included in the Alberta CPG . Between 10 February and 24 February 2014 , the surveys were emailed to former GDG (1st Edition), Advisory Committee (1st Edition) , and Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE I: SET -UP 8 Update Comm ittee (2nd Edition) members, to GUC members (3rd Edition), and to 140 other stakeholders - individuals involved in Ambassador Program activities (n=38), clinicians from Bone and Joint Canada (n=25), physicians from the Alberta Primary Care Networks (n=77), and patients affiliated with the Chronic Pain Association of Canada. Twenty participants answered the clinician survey, listing 27 new interventions. Another eight interventions were proposed by members of the GUC. None of the patient surveys were complet ed. Interventions for low back pain that were recently advertised in local newspapers (the Calgary Herald and the Edmonton Journal ) were also included. About Low Back Pain Definition of nonspecific low back pain - acute, subacute, chronic Nonspecific low back pain is defined as pain, muscle tension, or stiffness that occurs between the rib cage and the inferior gluteal folds, with or without leg pain (sciatica), and has no identifiable cause. 12,13 Specific back pain is associated with an identified pathological cause, such as infection, arthritis, fracture, or tumour.12,14 Nonspecific low back pain, which occurs in approximately 90% of cases in primary care settings, is usually classified according to symptom duration as acute (<6 weeks), subacute (between 6 weeks and 3 months), or chronic (>3 months). 13-15 Less than 2% of people with low back pain have potentially serious spine conditions that will require surgery or medical intervention. 16,17 Epidemiology of low back pain Estimates of prevalence and incidence for low back pain vary widely depending on the definitions used and the populations studied. Between 49 and 90% of people in developed countries will experience at least one episode of low back pain during their lifetime. The point prevalence and period prevalence range from 4 to 33% and from 25 to 42%, respectively.13,18 -21 Low back pain is most common among the working population, particularly men, with peak incidence occurring in people aged between 25 and 64 years. 13 Up to 84% of people in developed count ries will experience at least one episode of low back pain during their lifetime, with up to 23% of the adult population suffering from back pain at any given time. 13,18 -22 Back pain is usually self -limiting and resolves within 2 to 6 weeks, but symptoms may linger for up to 2 months.13,15,23 -25 At least 25% o f patients will experience further episodes within a year, and over three quarters will have a recurrence at some point in their lives.13,15,22,24,26 A small minority of patients (2 to 7%) will develop chronic low back pain.13,15 Clinical need/burden of disease The management of low back pain can be c omplex and costly.27 In the United States, back problems are associated with nearly a quarter of all lost workdays. Back pain is now the second leading cause of work absenteeism, with approximately 2% of American adults either temporarily or chronically disabled by low back pain.18 While 67% of people on sick leave from low back pa in return to work within a week and 90% return within 2 months,27 patients who are absent for longer periods have a far less sanguine prognosis. Less than 50% of patients return to work after 6 months, and , after a 2 - year absence , there is virtually no chance that an individual will re -enter the work force.13 Back pain's economic burden to society largely consists of the indirect costs associated with work absenteeism and disablement. 21 The small subgroup of patients with chronic low back pain is responsible for the bulk of this expenditure.21,28 Chronic pain conditions are generally accompanied Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE I: SET -UP 9 by coincidental social, behavioural, and psychological problems that either precede or follow the development of the disease. This, in addition to the common presence of a financial disincentive to improve , a hostile work environment, and/or a dysfunctional family unit, can make the treatment of chronic pain complex and problematic. 29-31 Consequently, individuals with severe, chronic pain require, on average, three times as ma ny visits with a health professional and spend up to five times the number of days in hospital compared with patients who have mild or no pain. This high level of healthcare utilization often persists for many years if the condition is not resolved, making the prevention of chronicity an important aim of treatment. 28,32 In Alberta and Saskatchewan, close to 40% of patients with back pain seek help from a healthcare provider. 33 Primary care physicians undertake the initial evaluation in 65% of low back pain cases and are often the sole healthcare provider for these patients.34,35 Thus, primary care practitioners play an important role in the management of patients with low back pain.

Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE I: SET -UP 12 STAGE II: ADAPTATION IDENTIFY ING, SELECTING, AND APPRAISING THE SEED GUIDELINES This section contains the following information: Rationale for choosing an adaptation approach over de novo guideline production Search strategy used to identify the seed guidelines Criteria used to select the seed guidelines Method and results of the critical appraisal of the selected guidelines and systematic review evidence Rationale CPGs are systematically developed statements that assist practitioners and patients in choosing appropriate interventions for specific clinical situations. 1 The creation of CPGs can take different approaches that range from de novo development to adopting or adapting existing guidelines. The development and adaptation of CPGs are processes that necessitate extensive resources and expertise to ensure high quality outcomes. 2 The CPG adaptation process encompasses a variety of options, from accepting the entire guidelin e and its recommendations to partial acceptance of some of the guideline recommendations or its companion documents, with or without modification. For example, the Guidelines Advisory Committee 3 in Ontario, Canada, endorses guidelines based primarily on the methodological rigour of their development process, the quality of the linkage between evidence and recommendations for best clinical practice, and their applicability to the local context. In contrast, the COMPUS4 program of CADTH unbundles existing guidelines, reviews and updates the pertinen t evidence, and constructs a new guideline with input from a panel of experts. The adaptation process takes advantage of existing high quality CPGs while also allowing guideline developers to modify the guideline to meet the needs, priorities, legislation, policies, and resources of a targeted setting. 2 Adapting pre -existing guidelines offers the advantages of reduced duplication, decreased resource commitment, increased efficiency, and enhanced local uptake. Adaptation may be applied to only one guideline or multiple guidelines. Preliminary literature and consultation with clinical experts in Alberta revealed the existence of an important body of CPGs on low back pain that could be adapted to meet local needs, thereby avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort in developing a guideline from scratch. In addition, it was thought that the adaptation approach would capitalize on the heightened interest and receptivity of local users generated by the Ambassador Pilot Project, thereby allowing the production of a CPG that was more tailored and relevant to the Alberta context. Stage I - Set-up Formulate research question Stage II - Adaptation Search for and screen seed CPGs Assess and select seed CPGs Extract data into evidence tables Draft guideline document Stage III - F inalization Review and refine draft guideline Finalize and endorse guideline Disseminate guideline and plan update Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 13 Thus, the second phase of the Ambassador Program aimed t o adapt and contextualize good quality international and national guidelines on the management of low back pain in the primary care setting to the provincial healthcare system.5,6 Identifying Seed Guidelines Inclusion criteria Guidelines Guidelines (\"seed\" guidelines) were included if they focused on the diagnosis, conservative nonsurgical treatment, or prevention of nonmalignant, nonspecific low back pain and were designed for use in primary healthcare settings by physicians, physical therapists, chiropractors, occupational therapists, psychologists, nurses, physiatrists, and other healthcare providers who treat patients with back pain. Only CPGs formulated in countries with developed market economies were included since the health status, cultural norms, access to health care, and disease burden of in dividuals from countries with transitional or developing economies were likely to be too different from those in Canada to be clinically relevant. Countries deemed to have developed economies, as defined by the United Nations, were Australia, Canada, Japan , New Zealand, the United States, and European countries (except for those with transition economies). 7 Patient group Patients included individuals who were 18 years of age or older. Guidelines that referred to adult patients without providing a specific age range were also included. Condition For gui delines on treatment and diagnosis, the duration of pain was defined as follows: acute and subacute pain : pain of less than 12 weeks' duration chronic pain : pain of at least 12 weeks' duration Guidelines that referred to adult patients with \"chronic pain\" but that lacked a definition of chronic pain in terms of time period (i.e., at least 12 weeks) were also included. Exclusion criteria The following were excluded: guidelines focused on inpatient interventions, such as surgical treatments guidelines focused on children or adolescents, pregnant women, or patients with specific causes for low back pain, such as referred pain (from abdomen, kidney, ovary, pelvis, bladder), inflammatory neoplasm, or metabolic bone disease (osteoporosis, osteomalacia, Paget's disease) Literature search strategies For the 1 st Edition of the Alberta CPG , a preliminary systematic literature search was conducted to identify relevant guidelines published in English between January 1996 and February 2006. The Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 14 search was further refined and update s were conducted in April 2006, October 2006, June 2007, and February 2008. For the 2nd Edition of the Alberta CPG , these searches were updated to identify relevant guidelines published in English between January 2001 and June 2010. An additional update se arch was conducted in October 2010. The date restriction was applied to ensure that the guidelines collected were current and clinically relevant. For the 3rd Edition of the Alberta CPG , the searches were updated to identify relevant guidelines published i n English from October 2010 (end date of the 2nd Edition search) to October 2013. An additional update search was conducted in April 2014 ( see Table 1 below ). Relevant websites were also checked for updates or revisions to previously included seed guidelin es.

Semicolons are used to indicate terms that were searched separately. Selecting the Seed Guidelines The initial selection of guidelines was made by one reviewer and double -checked by a second reviewer. Guidelines were excluded that, on the basis of their abstract, clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria. Copies of the full text of potentially eligible guidelines were retrieved. In some cases, closer examination of the full text revealed that the guideline did not meet the inclusion criteria. Consequently, these papers were excluded (see Appendix D ). When a single guideline development group had published more than one guideline, only the most recent version was used. Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 19 Critically Appraising the Seed Guidelines The included guidelines were assessed with respect to various aspects of methodology and reporting using the original Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument.9,10 Although a new edition of the tool, AGREE tool (II), was published in May 2009,11,12 to maintain consistency and continuity in the guideline appraisal process, the Research Team decided to continu e using the original AGREE tool9,10 that had been used in the 1st and 2nd Editions of the Alberta CPG . The AGREE instrument is an internationally developed, generic tool that is validated, transparent, and widely accepted, with satisfactory reliability for m ost domains. The original instrument has 23 key items organized into the following six domains: Scope and Purpose (items 1 to 3) reflects the overall aim/objective of the CPG, specific clinical question(s), and target population. Stakeholder Involvement (items 4 to 7) contains representations of views of intended users. Rigor of Development (items 8 to 14) is the process used to gather and synthesize the evidence, and the methods used to formulate the recommendations and to update them. Clarity of Presentation (items 15 to 18) assesses the language and format of the CPG. Applicability (items 19 to 21) refers to the organizational and cost implications of applying the guideline. Editorial Independence (items 22 to 23) indicates the independence of th e recommendations and acknowledgement of possible conflict of interest from the GDG. The tool is accompanied by a detailed user guide that explains how to score the 23 items.13 Each guideline is assessed by at least two (ideally four) appraisers using a four -point scale (ranging from 4 = \"strongly agree\" to 1 = \"strongly disagree\") to rate each of the 23 items. These scores are then combined for each of the six domains and converted into standardized domain scores as per the following formula: Standardized domain score (%) = obtained score - minimum possible score \u00d7 100 maximum possible score - minimum possible score The six domain scores are independent and cannot be combined into a single score. Instead, appraisers can provide an overall assessment of the guideline according to the following categories: strongly recommended recommended (with provisos or alterations) would not be recommended unsure The Research Team modified the original AGREE tool to reduce the ambiguity and subjectivity associated with item scoring , and to enable the differentiation of good from poor quality guidelines. Three modifications were made as follows:14 Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 20 1. A detailed set of instructions, or dictionary, based on the original AGREE user guide was constructed using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to quantify what constitutes a score of 4, 3, 2, or 1 for each of the 23 items (see Appendix E ). 2. The three criteria relating to objectives, clinical question(s), and target population in the Scope and Purpose domain were considered mandatory for a good quality guideline. If a guideline scored less than 4 for any of these elements, it was excluded from further appraisal. Thus, all guidelines meeting these three criteria received the maximum possible total domain score of 12 (3 \u00d7 4), and all included guidelines achieved a standardized score of 100% for this domain. 3. Seven \"essential\" criteria were identified for categorizing guidelines as good, moderate, or poor quality :15 o Item 8: Systematic search conducted o Item 10: Methods us ed to formulate recommendations described o Item 12: Link between recommendations and evidence o Item 13: External review by experts o Item 15: Specific, unambiguous recommendations o Item 22: Editorial independence from funder o Item 23: Conflicts of interest reported The average quality score (maximum possible of 28 [7 \u00d7 4]) was then rated as: good - a score of 22 to 28 average - a score of 15 to 21 poor - a score of 0 to 14 The seed guideline quality assessments were undertaken independently by two reviewers who discussed the dictionary with respect to the interpretation of questions prior to assessing the guidelines. When the scores for an item differed by at least two points, the reviewers re -examined and discussed the item until the disparity was less than two points by consensus. Critically Appraising the Systematic Reviews on New Interventions The IHE Database was searched to identify recently published systematic reviews on in terventions proposed by stakeholders ( the SC, the GUC , members of the former GDG [1st Edition], Update Committee [ 2nd Edition], and Advisory Committee, and others) that were considered important by the GUC, but which were not covered in the Alberta CPG , 2nd Edition or in the new seed guidelines. Interventions for low back pain that were recently advertised in local newspapers ( the Calgary Herald and the Edmonton Journal ), were also included. Two Research Team members and another IHE researcher critically appraised the systematic reviews found on the following new interventions: antibiotic treatment, the Clinically Organized Relevant Exam (CORE) back screening tool, diagnostic facet and sacroiliac joint blocks, duloxetine, gravity tables (inversion/inverted traction, self-traction, gravitational traction), low -level laser therapy, max imum frequency of administering epidural steroid injections, medial branch blocks, messaging regarding likelihood of recurrence of low back pain, mindfulness -based meditation, radiofrequency neurotomy, referral for inflammatory Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 21 disease, shock -wave treatmen t, strategies for reassuring patients about not having diagnostic imaging, trigger point injections, and vitamin B12 injections. The systematic reviews were assessed with respect to various aspects of methodology and reporting using an in- house quality app raisal checklist adapted from a number of sources ( see Appendix F ). The checklist was operationalized by constructing a dictionary that explained each criterion. The reviewers discussed the dictionary with respect to the interp retation of questions prior to assessing the reviews. The quality of each systematic review was assessed independently by two reviewers. Any disagreements in scoring were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached. The systematic reviews were rate d according to six essential quality criteria as good, average, or poor. Critical appraisal results for all of the included reviews are tabulated in Appendix G . Although the results of the quality appraisal were examined by the SC, interventions with poor -quality systematic review evidence were not excluded from the Alberta CPG . Extracting Data Two reviewers extracted guideline information into standardized evidence inventory tables that were developed a priori. However, duplicate data extraction and cross -checking were not performed. The evidence inventory tables included guideline profile information (title, country, intervention category; e.g., prevention, acute and subacute, or chronic low back pain), a synopsis of the recom mendations, and a list of the number and types of studies referenced by the guideline to support its recommendations , as well the grades assigned by the seed guidelines for the strengths of the recommendations. Only seed guideline recommendations that were not included or disagreed with those in the Alberta CPG , 2 nd Edition were listed in the evidence inventory tables. D iscordant recommendations among guidelines were highlighted within the table. Additional research evidence and information was required, particularly when recommendations were overlapping, discordant, or absent. These supplementary requests by the GUC or its Subcommittees , named \"parking lot\" items, necessitated examination of the individual studies cited by the seed guideline(s) or of other research evidence; i.e., systematic reviews on low back pain with a search end date of January 2007 onwards (for the 3 rd Edition) identified by a supplementary literature search of the IHE Database (for details , see Table 2). Only systematic reviews that focused on adults and had a clear definition of the duration of pain were considered. A n article was deemed to be a systematic review if it met all of the following criteria as defined by Cook et al. (1997):16 focused clinical qu estion ; explicit search strategy ; use of explicit, reproducible, and uniformly applied criteria for article selection ; critical appraisal of the included studies ; and qualitative or quantitative data synthesis . The information abstracted from studies refer enced by the seed guidelines or identified by a supplementary literature search of the IHE Database included (to the level of detail sufficient to allow an informed decision): objectives, studies reviewed, funding, inclusion and exclusion criteria, interventions, outcome measures, and relevant results and conclusions. If a potentially relevant systematic review lacked adequate detail to determine whether the target population, duration of Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 22 pain, or intervent ion was relevant, then the primary studies referred to in the review were retrieved for closer examination, when requested by the GUC or its Subcommittees. When required, the authors of the systematic review were also contacted by the Research Team to obta in further information. If a systematic review included multiple interventions or conditions, only the results and conclusions related to the intervention or condition of interest were extracted. The primary studies included in these reviews were not disa ggregated into the various component conditions or interventions, nor were any additional analyses conducted by the Research Team (e.g. , appraising the quality of primary studies or conducting supplementary meta -analyses). When no systematic review was av ailable for a specific intervention, information was considered from the most recent quasi- systematic review(s) (defined as a review that did not critically appraise the included studies) or narrative review(s) (defined as a review that did not use a searc h strategy or critically appraise the included studies) listed in the IHE Database of systematic reviews. The information abstracted from quasi -systematic or narrative reviews (referenced by seed guidelines or identified in the supplementary literature sea rch) was less comprehensive than for systematic reviews and only included a summary of the relevant results and conclusions. Recommendations Based on Expert Opinion or Expired Evidence The IHE Database was also searched to identify recently published syst ematic reviews on: any recommendations from the Alberta CPG , 2nd Edition that were based on \"expired\" research evidence ( older than 7 years from search end date of the source seed guideline to the current date,8 which was taken as December 2013 for this update) and were not covered in the new seed guideline s. These included the following: o prevention of occurrence and recurrence of low back pain: physical activity, shoe insoles/orthoses, spinal manipulation, mattress es, chairs; and o acute and subacute low back pain : epidural steroid s with or without radiculopathy. recommendations from the Alberta CPG , 2nd Edition that were demarcated with a recommendation category of \" Do\" or \" Do Not Do\" and were based on the expert opinion of the GDG (1st Edition) or the Update Committee (2nd Edition) but were not covered in the new seed guidelines. These included the following recommendations for chronic low back pain: diagnostic tests, laboratory testing, therapeutic exercise, active rehabilitation, and referral for surgical opinion on spinal fusion. The quality of the newly included systematic reviews was appraised by th e Research Team using the in-house IHE quality tool (see Appendix F ). References 1.

Six relevant new guidelines were identified by the update 's literature searches ( see Appendix D and Appendix H). Two guidelines focused on acute/subacute low b ack pain, three on chronic low back pain, and one on low back pain (duration of pain not stated). An update of one seed guideline, G2, which was incorporated in the 1 st and 2nd Editions of the Alberta CPG , was also included. The modified AGREE tool was use d to appraise all potentially eligible seed guidelines. Results were reviewed by the two co-chairs of the GUC on 2 December 2013. Two guidelines, one on acute low back pain and one on acute/subacute/chronic low back pain, were excluded due to their average quality rating and low scores on the AGREE domains of rigour of development, applicability, and editorial independence, and after reviewing their clinical relevance ( see Appendi x D and Appendix I). This decision, as well as the quality appraisal results for all of the potentially eligible seed guidelines, was presented to the GUC at the inaugural face -to-face meeting on 7 March 2014. The seed guideline that did not define the duration of pain (G10 1) was later approved for inclusion by the Diagnostic Imaging and Interventions Subcommittee of the GUC. A second guideline (G11) published in December 2013 was not captured by the October 2013 literature search, but was considered useful by the SC and approved for inclusion. The reason for this was the lack of seed guidelines available on chronic low back pain in the previous versions of the Alberta CPG . A final search for seed guidelines was conducted in April 2014 and yielded no further seed guidelines. Thus, 11 seed guidelines (three new guidelines and eight, including one updated guideline, from the previous two editions) were used in the adaptation process and were included in the 3 rd Edition of the Alberta CPG (see Appendix H ). The references for the excluded guidelines, together with their AGREE scores and evidence inv entory tables, were provided to the GUC. The AGREE critical appraisal results (standardized domain scores and average quality scores based on the seven essential criteria) for the new included seed guidelines, and also for the two guidelines Stage I - Set-up Formulate research question Stage II - Adaptation Search for and screen seed CPGs Assess and select seed CPGs Extract data into evidence tables Draft guideline document Stage III - F inalization Review and refine draft guideline Finalize and endorse guideline Disseminate guideline and plan updat e Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 26 subsequently e xcluded, are provided in Appendix I . Evidence inventory tables for the new seed guidelines are provided in Appendix J . Update protocol There is no published information on how to deal with \"old\" evidence in subsequent iterations of an updated guideline developed using an adaptation process. Since recommendations differ in terms of their need for review, partial updating of a guideline may be just as effective as, and more efficient than, full upda ting when there is an ongoing monitoring system. 2 To streamline the updat e process and avoid the wholesale, and unnecessary, review of the entire Alberta CPG every two years, a systematic protocol was devised for conducting sequential partial updates of the Alberta CPG (see Table 3 below ). This focused th e limited available resources on reviewing only those recommendations that truly required updating. Therefore, in addition to reviewing three new guidelines, the present update involved: a) updating seven existing recommendations that were based on expired evidence; b) updating five \" Do\" and \" Do Not Do\" recommendations that were based on the expert opinion of the GDG (1 st Edition) or the Update Committee (2nd Edition); c) reviewing evidence on new interventions that were not included in the Alberta CPG to date; and d) checking drug alerts from Health Canada and the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for changes in medication availability and safety. T ABLE 3: Ambassador Program guideline update protocol Timeline Process Details Annually Scan literature for new seed guidelines according to TOP requirements Update triggered when there are at least two new seed guidelines of good quality as judged by the AGREE tool3 (can include new seed guidelines or updates of previously reviewed guidelines) containing recommendations suggesting that the Alberta guidance needs to be updated After two years (quadrennially thereafter) Update \"Do Not Know\" re commendations by searching for recently published systematic reviews Update medication table by searching for recently published systematic reviews for all drugs listed therein Survey stakeholders to identify new interventions of interest that are not included in the Ambassador Program guideline Check US FDA and Health Canada drug alerts for changes in medication availability and safety After four years (quadrennially thereafter) Update old* recommendations that are based on expired evidence by searching for recently published systematic reviews Update \"Do\" and \"Do Not Do\" recommendations that are based on EO (GDG/GUC) evidence by searching for recently published systematic reviews Survey stakeholders to identify new interventions of interest that are not included in the Ambassador Program guideline Check US FDA and Health Canada drug alerts for changes in medication availability and safety *More than 7 years from search end date of seed guideline to current date4 AGREE: Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation; EO: GDG: Guideline TOP: Toward Optimized Practice; US FDA: United States Food and Drug Administration In following this protocol , it was decided that , rather than removing the outdated seed guidelines from the Alberta CPG , the information would be updated according to the protocol in Table 3 above and the references for the older guidelines would be cited alongside those for the newer evidence . Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 27 Committees The inaugural face -to-face GUC meeting was held in Edmonton on 7 March 2014. The GUC comprised former members, including the two co-chairs, of the Update Committee (1st Edition) and other invited specialists in pain management. T he GUC reviewed the results of the survey for new interventions and all of the documents for the new seed guidelines (the guidelines plus their companion documents, evidence inventory tables, and AGREE scores). To e xpedite the recommendation review process, three topic -specific GUC Subcommittees were formed: 1) the Diagnostic Imaging and Interventions Subcommittee; 2) the Rehabilitation Subcommittee; and 3) the Pharmacology/Analgesia Subcommittee. The Subcommittees h ad one or two chairpersons (the second was always a GUC co -chair) and included one HTA researcher and at least one volunteer from the GUC with relevant expertise. Two Subcommittees included invited clinical experts who were not members of the GUC: the Diag nostic Imaging and Interventions Subcommittee (one pain medicine specialist, one physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, one radiologist, and one rheumatologist) and the Rehabilitation Subcommittee (one pain medicine specialist, one physical medic ine and rehabilitation specialist, and one kinesiologist). Recommendations were assigned by the GUC to the appropriate Subcommittees for discussion and deliberation. Formulating recommendations To simplify the task of reviewing the new research evidence, only those recommendations that were discordant with or contained more information than the Alberta CPG , or that were new (i.e., were not included in the 2 nd Edition of the Alberta CPG ), were tabulated in the evidence inventory tables. The recommendations from the 2nd Edition of the Alberta CPG were listed for reference alongside the new evidence, where applicable. Evidence inventory tables for the guidelines common to the 1st and 2nd Editions of the Alberta CPG can be found in the background documents for the 1st and 2nd Editions of this guideline (Appendix G) .5,6 The three Subcommittees reviewed t he evidence inventory tables and drafted new or revised recommendations during half -day meetings via WebEx: the Diagnostic Imaging and Interventions Subcommittee had four meetings , from 8 May 2014 to 3 March 2015; the Rehabilitation Subcommittee had five m eetings , from 12 June 2014 to 9 March 2015; and the Pharmacolog y/ Analgesia Subcommittee had two meetings on 19 June and 29 September 2014 , as well as two shorter meetings on 20 January and 26 February 2015. The GUC reviewed all of the drafted recommendations during four half -day WebEx meetings over the period from January to March 2015. The agenda and all documents were provided in advance for each meeting, and participants had the option of joining the meetings via telephone if they could not attend the face-to-face meeting in - person or use the WebEx conferencing system. Each of the Subcommittee meetings was guided by both co- chairs. Frequent \"roundtables\" were conducted during each meeting to ensure that all participants had a voice in the proceedings, a nd process reviews were instigated at strategic points throughout. All final decisions were made by consensus and then presented to the GUC for final approval. To expedite the process, a co -chair of the Rehabilitation Subcommittee circulated draft recomme ndations via email for Subcommittee and subgroup members to review in advance of the meetings. The Rehabilitation Subcommittee also used an online survey, conducted between 6 and 14 January 2015, to gain consensus on draft recommendations prior to the GUC meeting. Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 28 In many cases, additional evidence was required when uncertainties or disagreements arose regarding interpretation of the evidence from the seed guidelines or when new interventions that were not included in the seed guidelines or the 2 nd Edition of the Alberta CPG were considered. These requests by the GUC or Subcommittees, named \"parking lot\" items, encompassed the examination of individual research studies cited by the seed guidelines as well as additional systematic reviews on low back pain pu blished between 2007 and January 2014 identified by a supplementary literature search of the IHE Database ( see Table 2). The parking lot items were referred for further analysis to the relevant Subcommittees, or to ad hoc subgroups of the Subcommittees comprising one Subcommittee chair, one HTA researcher, and at least one Subcommittee member or an invited clinical expert with expertise in the relevant area (see Figure 1 below ). Information generated from these subgroups wa s presented to the relevant Subcommittee for final review. Consensus -based decisions made by the Subcommittees were then presented to the GUC for final approval. F or information about the parking lot items and other miscellaneous requests made by the GUC, Subcommittees , and SC, the deliberations of the Subcommittees, and the dates when the actions and final approval of the recommendations took place , see Appendix K. The c ommittees identified 65 parking lot items (5 prevention, 2 4 acute and subacute, and 36 chronic low back pain) ( see Appendix K). Parking lot items included existing recommendations based on expired evidence ( older than 7 years from search end date of the source seed guideline to the cu rrent date, which was taken as December 2013 for this update) , \"Do\" and \" Do Not Do\" recommendations based on the expert opinion of the GDG (1 st Edition) or the Update Committee (2nd Edition), new interventions that were not included in the 2nd Edition of t he Alberta CPG , and queries about revised or new recommendations from the GUC or the three Subcommittees. A single new recommendation on spinal mobilization for acute and subacute low back pain was generated from parking lot item discussions alone rather than from seed guidelines or proposals from stakeholders . A summary table of the revisions made to the Alberta CPG for the 3 rd Edition is available in Appendix L . A sample of a parking lot item document prepared by the Researc h Team for discussion in a Subcommittee meeting is provided in Appendix M . Other parking lot item documents are available upon request. To keep track of the deliberations relating to formulating Alberta CPG recommendations, the SC and the Research Team developed an internal document for each Subcommittee that included the original wording of each recommendation from the seed guidelines, discussions undertaken and decisions made by the Subcommittees, revision s of each draft recommendation, and the evidence source for each recommendation. These documents were continuously updated throughout the guideline development process, and an abridged version was provided to the GUC at each meeting. A sample of these docu ments is provided in Appendix N. Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 29 FIGURE 1: Process of formulating recommendations and resolving parking lot items The SC and the Research Team added harm statements to some recommendations, where appropriate; these were sourced from the original seed guideline recommendations or from elsewhere in the seed guidelines, or from a systematic review identified from a supplementary literature search required by the GDG or GUC. The lack of a harm statement for some recommendations indicates an absence of adverse event information in the seed guidelines, not an absence of adverse events for the intervention itself. Harm statements were added to the following new or updated recommendations: acute and subacute low back pain : brief course of narcotic analgesics, acetaminophen and non- steroidal an ti-inflammatory low back pain : opioids, therapeutic lumbar facet joint interventions More information required New seed guidelines on low back pain (n=3 new; 1 update) Alberta CPG 3rd Edition recommendations (n=115) (Guideline Update Committee) Reject original recommendation and create new one based on expert opinion Parking lot items (n=65) (Subcommittees) Accept, or accept with minor modification Ad hoc expert group dis cussions Systematic reviews from IHE Database Primary studies cited in seed guidelines Accept, but supplement with expert opinion Alberta CPG 2nd Edition recommendations (n=85) New interventions (stakeholders) (n=35) Seed guideline recommendations (new or discordant, n=26; additional information, n=11) Expert opinion GUC recommendations from Alberta CPG 2nd Edition (n=5) Expired evidence source (n=7) New interventions (n=35) Refine recommendations with GLIA tool (Steering Committee) Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 30 The medication table provided in the 1st Edition of the Alberta CPG was adapted from the G6 seed guideline by a subcommittee of the GDG, in consultation with pharmaceutical experts who w ere not part of the GDG. This table was re -assessed for the 2nd Edition by conducting supplementary searches to identify published systematic reviews on the drugs mentioned in the medication table as well as on new drugs being considered for inclusion. For the 3rd Edition, the drug alerts from Health Canada and the US FDA were checked for changes in medication availability and safety and new research evidence from seed guidelines and other background information suggested by the Pharmacology/Analgesia Subco mmittee was reviewed. As a result, the following revisions were made: chronic low back pain : added opioids watchful dose equivalents and revised the side effects a nd ongoing monitoring sections neuropathic pain if co- emergent with musculoskeletal complaints : revised and updated the 1st and 2nd lines of treatment, modified the daily doses of duloxetine and venlafaxine, and removed the 3 rd and 4th lines of treatment sleep disturbance accompanying chronic pain : removed the section The definitions and information regarding yellow flags that were included in the Alberta CPG were sourced, without modification, from the New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation guideline (2003). 7 No updates or changes were made for the 3rd Edition of the Alberta CPG . The information about red flags that was contained in the 1st Editio n of the Alberta CPG was adapted from two seed guidelines (G2 and G4) by a subcommittee of the GDG that included the chair of the GDG, one HTA researcher, and two physicians. The red flags were reviewed and revised for the 2nd Edition of the Alberta CPG during a half -day, face -to-face, special topic meeting , and again for the 3rd Edition by the Diagnostic Imaging and Interventions Subcommittee. A new companion document for clinicians, titled Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology , was created by the Diagnostic Imaging and Interventions Subcommittee (available from : www.ihe.ca/research -programs/hta/aagap/lbp ) to help clinicians provide more d etailed explanations for patients seeking information on interventional lumbar spine procedures. Definitions of various terms and other general clarifications required for the interventions covered by the seed guidelines and for the new interventions were provided to the GUC and Subcommittees . Fifty-seven terms are incorporated in the Alberta CPG glossary, which was updated in the 3 rd Edition and is listed in Appendix O . Rationale and Process for Developing Recommendations Each recommendation from the Alberta CPG was sourced from one or multiple seed guidelines and was accepted, supplemented, or changed as follows: Accepted, or accepted with min or modification (e.g., wording) Accepted, but s upplemented with expert opinion Additional information retrieved/considered: o accepted/changed original recommendation based only on studies included in seed guidelines Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 31 o accepted/changed original recommendation based on additional evidence from systematic review literature search o supplemen ted addition al evidence with expert opinion In wording the recommendations, the GUC, Subcommittees, SC, and Research Team considered the GuideLine Implementability Appraisal (GLIA) tool,8,9 which is designed for appraising the implementability of CPGs. It explores different dimensions of individual recommendations, such as decidability, executability, effect on process of care, presentation and formatting, measurable outcomes, apparent validity, novelty/innovation, flexibility, and computab ility. The SC and Research Team met several times over the period from 19 June to 25 September 2015 to refine the wording of recommendations. TOP also assisted in simplifying the wording of the recommendations. In the Alberta CPG , the type of evidence (ev idence source) referenced by the seed guideline(s) in support of the original recommendation was represented as follows ( note that some evidence types are not listed because not all study designs were cited by the seed guidelines) : Systematic review (SR), as cited by the seed guideline(s) or identified by the supplementary search for literature that was required by the GDG (1st Edition), Update Committee (2nd Edition), or GUC (3rd Edition). The literature search spanned the period between January 1996 and A ugust 2007 for the 1st Edition of the guideline, between January 2002 and December 2010 for the 2nd Edition, and between January 2010 and January 2014 for the 3rd Edition. Randomized controlled trial (RCT), as cited by the seed guideline(s). Non-randomized comparative study (NRCS), as cited by the seed guideline(s) . Case series (CS), as cited by the seed guideline(s). Guideline (G), as cited by the seed guideline. Expert opinion (EO), as cited by the seed guideline, when no evidence was provided by the seed guideline in support of the recommendation. EO (GDG) or EO (GUC): After examining the individual studies cited by the seed guideline(s), additional SRs on low back pain as identified by a supplementary literature search spanning from January 1996 to Apri l 2014, or other references nominated by the GDG or GUC members, or when no evidence from SRs was found on an intervention, the original recommendation was rejected and or a new recommendation was drafted based on the collective EO of the GDG or GUC . For evidence cited by the seed guideline(s), only the highest level of evidence was listed. For example, when the evidence cited by a seed guideline was from SRs and studies of other design (i.e., RCT, NRCS, CS, or G) only SR was listed as the source. When no SR was referenced in the seed guideline, the evidence source was indicated in the following order: RCT, NRCS, CS, G, EO. The same classification for the evidence source was applied when multiple seed guidelines were used to inform one recommendation. Each recommendation in the Alberta CPG came from one or more seed guidelines or SRs from the IHE Database, or was created by the GDG (1 st Edition), Update Committee (2nd Edition), or GUC (3rd Edition) , based on their collective professional opinion and an analy sis of relevant evidence. Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 32 Recommendations that used SRs from the IHE Database in their evidence source together with the relevant SR citations are listed in Appendix P. For Alberta CPG recommendations that were sourced from a s eed guideline(s) with an outdated evidence source (more than 7 years from search end date of seed guideline to current date, which was taken as December 2013 for this update ) as well as by an SR from the IHE Database or a more recent seed guideline(s), the citation for the old seed guideline was retained . Citations of the older seed guideline(s) were removed only if in the update process a new recommendation was developed by the GUC based on evidence from a new seed guideline that would constitute a change of recommendation category (e.g., from \" Do\" to \" Do Not Do\"), or if the older recommendation is supported by newer research evidence of a higher evidence level (e.g. , from other seed guidelines or an SR from the IHE Database). Classification of Recommendati ons Although 11 average - to good -quality guidelines informed the 3rd Edition of the Alberta CPG (see Appendix F ), the AGREE tool could not verify the validity of the guideline recommendations and the underlying evidence, or reconcile differences in evidence rating scales. In addition, the seed guidelines were inconsistent in how they rated the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations. Also, because of time constraints, the Ambassador Program guideline adaptation process could not unbundle the seed guidelines to review all of the research evidence cited by the guidelines to support their recommendations. Therefore, a process was develop ed to ensure a standardized definition of the final guideline recommendations in the Alberta CPG (i.e., what constituted a \" Do\", \"Do Not D o\", or \" Do Not Know\" recommendation), systematically meld the seed guidelines' recommendations into consistently worde d recommendations, and display the source (e.g., seed guideline(s), expert opinion) of the final recommendations in a transparent and systematic way (see Appendix Q ). In the Alberta CPG , the recommendations are categorized into three groups: \" Do\", \"Do Not Do \" (i.e., not recommended), and \"Do Not Know \" (see Table 4 below ); more details on the recommendation categories are available in Appendix R . Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 33 T ABLE 4: Definitions for recommendation categories Recommendation Category Definition Do The GDG or GUC accepted the original recommendation, which provided a prescriptive direction to perform the action or used the term \"effective\" to describe it. The GDG or GUC supplemented a recommendation or created a new one based on their collective professional opinion, which supported the action. A supplementary literature search found at least one systematic review presenting consistent evidence to support the action. Do not do The GDG or GUC accepted the original recommendation, which provided a prescriptive direction \"not\" to perform the action, or used the term \"ineffective\" to describe it, or stated that the evidence does \"not support\" it. The GDG or GUC supplemented a recommendation, or created a new one based on their collective professional opinion, which did not support the action. A supplementary literature search found at least one systematic review presenting consistent evidence that did not support the action. Do not know ? The GDG or GUC accepted the original recommendation, which did not recommend for or against the action, or stated that there was \"no evidence,\" \"insufficient or conflicting evidence,\" or \"no good support its use. The GDG or GUC supplemented a recommendation or created a new one based on their collective professional opinion, which was equivocal with respect to supporting the action. A supplementary literature search found either no systematic reviews (\"insufficient evidence to recommend for or against\") or at least one systematic review presenting conflicting or equivocal results or stating that the evidence in relation to the action was \"limited,\" \"inconclusive,\" \"inconsistent,\" or \"insufficient\" (\"inconclusive evidenc e to recommend for or against\"). Limitations of the Guideline Development Process Using seed guidelines minimized resource commitment, and the expedited development process ensured the continued engagement of clinical experts. Stakeholder buy -in was also fostered by the contextualization process. However, the below challenges were identified: The AGREE tool identified well- developed and reported guidelines , but could not verify the validity of the recommendations and the underlying evidence, or reconcile differences in evidence rating scales. Clinical judgement was needed for overlapping, discordant, or absent recommendations. The strength and quality of the underlying empirical evidence was not formally assessed and could not be defined by terms such as good, fair, poor, insufficient , or conflicting , which made categorizing the strength and type of recommendations problematic. Faith in the process can be undermined by the fear of using inferior seed guidelines. Recently published evidence is not necessarily incorporated. Not all recommended treatment options are available in all communities, nor are all treatment options necessarily covered by CPGs. Updating an adapted guideline posed the following additional challenges , which became apparent during the revision process: Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 34 How to efficiently e xtract information from the new seed guidelines into evidence tables without duplicating previous effort: only new or discordant recommendations were extracted from the additional seed guidelines. How to incorporate new seed guideline information, while pr eserving the accumulated knowledge from previous guidelines whose publication dates would otherwise render them obsolete: original citations were retained, new guideline references were added when the guideline supported the original recommendation, and an y changes to original recommendations were highlighted within the updated guideline. How to incorporate new interventions and revise recommendations rated as \" Do Not Know\" in the original Alberta CPG that are not addressed by the new seed guidelines: search for and appraise any systematic review evidence on the interventions and use ad hoc subcommittees to deliberate on the additional information. How to form a streamlined, multidisciplinary GDG/GUC that maximizes local relevance and buy -in, but is also efficient: ensure continuity by using the same experienced GDG/GUC chair , SC, and Research Team, together with a smaller GUC comprising some of the original GDG who are familiar with the adaptation proc ess; ration expertise wisely; and clearly outline the process and responsibilities of all participants upfront.

Ambassador Pr ogram guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE II: ADAPTATION 36 STAGE III: FINALIZATION REVIEW ING, EVALUATING, AND ENDORSING THE GUIDELINE Reviewing the Alberta CPG The 1st Edition of the Alberta CPG (summary, guideline, and companion documents) was reviewed by various stakeholders (professionals with experience and interest in pain management, members of the GDG and their colleagues, and patients with acute and chronic low back pain) as well as two independent methodologists with expertise in guideline development. The SC and Research Team collated all feedback and incorporated it, where possible, into the Alberta CPG . For the 2 nd Edition of the Alberta CPG , the Update Committee and healthcare practit ioners from the TOP dissemination list were asked to provide feedback on the clarity of the recommendations, particularly the new and revised sections of the guideline, and their implementability in practice and, more generally, in the Alberta healthcare e nvironment. A web -based survey form was created to assist in providing feedback. A pilot study 1 was also conducted in August 2011 among 83 final -year physical therapy students at the University of Alberta to evaluate the utility of measuring awareness of and adherence to the Alberta CPG . For the 3 rd Edition of the Alberta CPG , the GUC and Subcommittee members were asked to provide feedback on the clarity of the recommendations, particularly the new and revised sections of the guideline, and their implementability within primary care practice in Alberta. The respondents include d two family physicians, one specialist physician, two physical therapy/rehabilitation professionals, and one pharmacist from three of the five Alberta Health Services zones (i.e., Edmonton, Calgary, and South). A sample of the web- based survey form and the responses received are provided in Appendix S . The Alberta CPG , 3 rd Edition was endorsed by the TOP program, which is funded under the Master Agreement between the Alberta Medical Association (AMA), Alberta Health Services, a nd Alberta Health. TOP is administered by the AMA.

The evaluation aimed : a) to identify the major challenges and successful strategies associated with the process; b) to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the process by benchmarking it against the ADAPTE framework ;2,3 and c) to identify opportunities for improvement in future iterations of the adaptation process. A comparison of the process, tools, and deliverables revealed a high degree of alignment between the Ambassador Program process and the ADAP TE framework.4,5 However, the Ambassador Program adaptation process differed from the ADAPTE method in several ways: A novel process wa s used to recruit GDG members. A more complex committee structure with alte red responsibilities was used. The AGREE tool was modified to reduce the ambiguity a nd subjectivity of item scoring. More detailed evidence inventory tables were created. Ad hoc GDG subcommittees were used to syst ematically review additional res earch evidence when necessary. Standardized definitions were constructed for the types of recommendations made in the Alberta CPG (e.g., what constituted a \" Do\" or \" Do Not Do \" recommendation) from the overlapping evidence ra ting scale s used by the seed guidelines. The principles of the GL IA tool6,7 were used to \"word -smith\" the final recommendations. A more comprehensive process was used to gather feedback on the draft guideline. There was strong consensus a mong the 29 stakeholders (GDG, A dvisory Committee , SC, and Research Team members) interviewed in the evaluation that the process used to develop the Alberta CPG was sound and rigorous. An evaluation of the updating process used to construct the 2nd and 3rd Editions of the Alberta CPG was not conducted. Guideline impact Key review criteria The key review criteria established in the dissemination and implementation plan8 for the 1st and 2nd Editions of the Alberta CPG are applicable to the 3rd Edition. The effectiveness of the knowledge transfer strategy can be assessed at several levels , including : reach indicators for any disseminated material (guideline and its companion documents for clinicians and patients) ; usefulness indicators of material/resources and activities ; use indicators, changes in practice ; changes in patient outcomes ; and satisfaction with visit . Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE III: FINALIZATION 38 Metrics for each of these include such things as number of hits on and downloads from the website hosting the CPG, media r equests, user satisfaction, and changes in physician practice. Desirable changes in physician behaviour include the following :9 improvement in assessing red flags reduction in inapp ropriate ordering of diagnostic imaging tests increase in provision of appropriate education and reassurance to patients reduction of inappropriate recommendations regarding sick leave, bed rest, and continuing activity increase in provision of correct rec ommendations for steroids, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants reduction of inappropriate prescription of passive physiotherapy and injection therapy increase in provision of appropriate recommendations for spinal manipulation increase in the appropriate prescription of physiotherapy, active rehabilitation, and patient self-management programs increase in the appropriate referral of patients to multidisciplinary pain clinics reduction in recommendations for traction reinforcement of the correct use of and adherence to guidelines for history taking and physical examination; prescribing of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen; and administration of heat and ice, therapeutic ultrasound, and massage therapy Changes in practice and o utcomes Research funding was obtained from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to evaluate implementing the Alberta CPG via a multidisciplinary, interactive workshop.10 This project involved a series of workshops with multidisciplinary primary care clinicians participating in the Alberta Primary Care Networks. The workshop content focused on providing participants with an overview of the Alberta CPG recommendations and with opportunities to participate in discussions and skills - based experiential learning modules focused on key clinical skills and str ategies to enhance patient acceptance and adherence. On 26- 27 October 2010, an invitational workshop was conducted on the optimal use of diagnostic imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) 11,12 based on recommendations from Alberta and other jurisdictions across Cana da. The aims were: to review available data on the use of diagnostic imaging for low back pain ; to develop an understanding of the barriers to and facilitators of the appropriate use of diagnostic imaging in primary care settings ; to review the results of implementation science (knowledge translation) research related to implementing policy -, professional -, and patient -level interventions to align clinical practice with evidence -informed recommendations ; and to develop a framework for a multifactorial knowledge translation program for diagnostic imaging in low back pain for primary care in Alberta . Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE III: FINALIZATION 39 Feedback from users of the Alberta CPG identified the recommendations related to the use of diagnostic imaging as being among the most difficult to implement in primary care practice. These concerns are consistent with Canadian and international literature, which indicates an overuse of diagnostic imaging for low back pain. Workshop attendees discussed the barriers to and facilitators of implementation from their various perspectives (policy, patient/public, clinician, and system/administration) and identified potential knowledge translation strategies as a foundation for next steps.

Details of participant responses are provided in Table 5 below . Further details are available in the background document for the 1 st Edition of the Alberta CPG .1 The barriers listed in Table 5 are also applicable to the 3rd Edition of the Alberta CPG . The update d recommendations in the 2nd Edition of the Alberta CPG were reviewed by members of the Update Committee and other healthcare practitioners from the TOP dissemination list. Feedback via a web -based form, which included questions about the potential barrier s to implementing the recommendations as well as resource implications associated with implementing the new recommendations, was received from one family physician, one specialist physician, two physical therapist/rehabilitation professionals , and one psychologist. Further details are available in the background document for the 2 nd Edition of the Alberta CPG .2 The updated recommendations in the 3rd Edition of the Alberta CPG were reviewed by members of the GUC and Subcommittees. Feedback via a web -based form, which included questions about the potential barriers to implementing the recommendations, was re ceived from two family physicians, one specialist physician, two physical therapy/rehabilitation professionals, and one pharmacist. A sample of the web -based survey form and the responses received are provided in Appendix S . The two-page guideline summary was also reviewed by participants at a workshop held during the Annual Calgary Pain Conference in December 2015 (Calgary, Canada) ( Appendix S, Table S.3). The patient information sheets and brochures were updated by the SC and reviewed by the IHE Lay Advisory Committee on 23 October 2015. A selection of their comments is provided in Appendix S, Table S.4. The SC reviewed this feedback, the majority of which was incorporated into the final versions of the patient materials. The revisions included streamlining the document formats, simplifying the wording, and clarifying the differentiation between the acute and chronic documents.

This document included a section on the state of practice and knowledge as well as barriers to change, grouped by audience. The plan also identified the key actors in the dis semina tion and implementation process: Physicians and other healthcare providers : A literature review on knowledge gaps,4 which focused on practition er compliance with CPGs on low back pain, stated that compliance is affected by a complex interplay of factors that influence practitioner beliefs, attitudes, and actions. Many determinants, such as regulatory decisions, allocation of resources, and availability of treatment options, are out of the practitioner's control. Patients : From a physician's perspective, agreement with guideline recommendations is a basic but not sufficient precondition for guideline implementation. Physicians may agree with guideline content but believe that guideline stipulations are not congruent with patient wishes. 3 However, other research has shown that patients with low back pain in primary care seek assurance and advice.1 Public : The public is an audience for the Alberta CPG , but using the public can also be seen as a strategy to support dissemination and implementation with other decision -makers in the healthcare system. Government : Government representation and involvement has been part of the Ambassador Program from its in ception. These representatives are in the best position to inform the dissemination and implementation of the Alberta CPG within government and within the Primary Care Ne tworks. Professional associations and colleges : Professional associations and colleges are an important means of facilitating communication with allied health professionals. They are also an audience in their own right, as the Alberta CPG might or might not align with their own intraprofessional guidelines. Health regions and provincial aut horities : The Ambassador Program will need to work with the informal regions within Alberta to customize the guidelines, with due consideration of the differences between urban and rural settings. Insurers and others : The interest in the Alberta CPG within this audience group will vary. For example, the Workers' Compensation Board may be more interested in the guideline than the Builders' Association. The intensity of dissemination and implementation within these groups will vary accordingly. Dissemination and Implementation Plan The Alberta CPG dissemination plan includes the following main strategies to manage barriers: Develop patient support materials (information sheets, instructional videos, website, brochures) and potentially a patient website with interactive teaching videos and other information. Target dissemination to the general public (media, brochure) and provide information to insurers. Involve partners: Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE III: FINALIZATION 43 o TOP, to launch the guideline ; o GUC members, to champion the CPG in their regions ; and o Bone and Joint Health Strategic Clinical Network, to incorporate the Alberta CPG . Facilitate access to the Alberta CPG on the TOP website from sites of other Alberta associations and organizations. Contact and connect with important stakeholders such as Alberta Health, Alberta Health Services, the Workers' Compensation Board, and the Primary Care Network s. Promote the CPG to professionals through different channels such as workshops, teaching support for continuing medical education (CME) in faculties of me dicine ( University of Calgary and University of Alberta ), presentation at one of the rural CME sessions, participation at conferences and other professional meetings, publication in peer -reviewed Canadian and international journals, and a consensus confere nce. Dissemination of the Alberta CPG has included peer -reviewed publications, conference presentations, workshops, and inclusion in academic curricula, 5 as well as the following activities: Listing on the Canadian Me dical Association (CMA) Infobase and the United States Department of Health and Human Services National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) . Creation of an educational YouTube video on self -management for chronic pain in collaboration with Alberta Innovates -Health Solutions (published June 2013). This complemented other YouTube videos on acute and chronic low back pain that were shown on the Health Unlimited Television in emergency department waiting rooms and physicians' offices, with a potential audience of approximately 650,000 Albertans per month (available from: www.ihe.ca/research -programs/hta/aagap/lbp ). Alignment with Choosing Wisely Canada's national recommendations from Radiology, Family Practice, Emergency, and Spine Medicine (available from : choosingwiselycanada.org ) - the Alberta CPG is referenced in the Canadian Association of Radiologists' top five recommendations for Choosing Wisely Canada (available from : www.choosingwiselycanada.org/recommendations/radiology/ ).

The G UC was established to be responsible for the ongoing review and maintenance of the Alberta CPG. The committee includes former members of the GDG (1st Edition of the Alberta CPG ) and new members (added in the 2nd and 3rd Editions of the Alberta CPG ) with expertise in the field. Technical support is provided by HTA researchers from the IHE. The task of the GUC is to ensure that the currency of the Alberta CPG is maintained over time. The timelines and process details for the sequential updating of the Alberta CPG are listed in Table 3. An update is triggered when at least two new guidelines (or updates of previously reviewed seed guidelines) of good quality, as judged by the modified AGREE tool, are identified that contain recommendations suggesting that the Alberta CPG needs to be updated. TOP and HTA researchers from the IHE will co -lead any future updates of the scientific content of the Alberta CPG . References 1. Institute of Health Economics (IHE).

Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, Edition: Bac kground doc ument STAGE FINA LIZATION 48 APPLICABILITY OF THE GUIDELINE - ECONOMIC/COST IMPLICATIONS This section contains the following information: Economic burden of low back pain Economic implications of recommendations reported in the seed guidelines Potential resource implications of the Alberta CPG General Aspects Low back pain is a common medical condition that is often associated with functional disability, and economic and social consequences that pose a substantial burden on affected individuals, the healthcare system, and society.1,2 The costs associated with low back pain include the direct cost of medical care and the indirect costs of time lost from work, disability payments, the cost of providing assistance, and diminished productivity. 2,3 The small num ber of individuals with low back pain who become chronically disabled is responsible for approximately 80% of the cost associated with caring for patients with low back pain. 4 Initial investments in infrastructure and the development of new programs for managing low back pain, such as developing an emergency back pain service, may add to total healthcare system costs. There is a general belief that medical care is based on scientific evidence and that clinical decisions about the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and management of a particular condition should also be evidence -based. However, professionals often have their own specific clinical opinions that affect the use of medical services, and also their costs. In the management of low back pain, there is documentation of large practice variations, which include the overutilization of diagnostic imaging, specialist r eferral, and certain ineffective treatments, such as activity restriction. 5 Adherence to CPGs may assist practitioner and patient decisions on appropriate health care , and may also improve practice and reduce costs. Focusing on high users and individuals with chronic conditions might ultimately improve outcomes for these patients and reduce short - and long -term costs. 1 Economic Implications Reported in the Seed Guidelines Formal econ omic evaluations or cost analyses were not performed or included in any of the new seed guidelines. The following statements were made in the seed guidelines regarding the economic implications of their recommendations. Patients should be encouraged to fol low-up with their healthcare provider in one to two weeks. Follow -up can be as an office visit or phone call. Although there is no evidence to support this, the work group concludes that the benefits of reinforcing education and activity for patients who a re improving outweigh the risk and potential costs (G2c). A randomized control trial confirmed that cognitive behavioural therapy reduced disability scores in a cost- effective manner (G2c). Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument APPLICABILITY OF THE GUIDELINE 49 Computerized tomography has the advantage of being more available and less costly than some other imaging techniques (G2c). Implementation of the guidelines may improve the quality of care, patient access, treatment outcomes, appropriateness of indicated and medically necessary care, and efficiency and effectiveness, as well as achieve cost containment by improving the cost -benefit ratio (G9). The G9 guideline developers reviewed published cost analyses, but no information was available for the recommendations (lumbar discography and diagnostic selective nerve root blocks) included in the Alberta CPG . Published cost analyses were reviewed in the G10 guideline, but no costings or economic evaluations were available for the recommendations (electrodiagnostic studies) included in the Alberta CPG . Published cost analyses were not reviewed in G11. The authors identified the following areas for furthe r research: investigation of strategies for combining drug therapies for optimal efficacy, safety and cost -effectiveness; economic modelling of the cost -effectiveness of an acupuncture service; and studies on the effect of music, in combination with other non- pharmacological therapies, on pain, medication use, and cost -effectiveness in patients with chronic pain. Economic implications reported in seed guidelines included in the previous editions of the Alberta CPG can be found in the respective background documents.6,7 Resource Implications of the Alberta CPG The updated recommendations were revie wed by members of the GUC and Subcommittees with respect to implementing the Alberta CPG , including resource implications. Feedback was received from two family physicians, one specialist physician, two physical therapy/rehabilitation professionals, and one pharmacist. A sample of the web -based survey form and the responses received are provided in Appendix S (Figure S.1 and Table S.2, respectively) . Because of time and res ource constraints, a formal cost analysis or economic evaluation of the impact of the Alberta CPG was not conducted. Nevertheless, information derived from such analyses (e.g., cost of implementation of multidisciplinary treatment programs, cost of unnecessary imaging tests) is important and useful in the decision -making process. Studies to address the resource implications of the Alberta CPG are planned for the future. Reference s Note: References for the seed guidelines (G2c, G9, G10, and CS, McAdam -Marx Fritz JM.

If the first mention of any of these elements occurs in the recommendations section, the guideline should not receive a score of 4. All of these elements are considered mandatory for a quality CPG, so if a guideline scores <4 for any of these elements, you do not need to assess it further. As all guidelines meeting these three criteria will receive the maximum possible total domain score of 12 (3 \u00d7 4), the standardized domain score will not be calculated since all of the guidelines will achieve 100%. Examples of the detailed instructions constructed using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) for the AGREE tool items are listed below.

Partially reported : External funding is mentioned but details are not provided. Not reported : Funding sources are not mentioned. Optional Quality Rating System The quality of syste matic reviews can be assessed according to how well their methods exclude bias and confounding by examining: the search strategy used; how the data extraction, quality assessment of the included studies, and data analysis/synthesis were conducted, and; whe ther the conclusions of the review match the results. Thus, the quality of the review can be rated numerically with respect to the six quality subsections (grey boxes above) as follows. Good - six criteria met, or five criteria met and one criterion \"unclear\" Avera g e - one criterion not met, or one criterion not met and one criterion \"unclear,\" or two criteria \"unclear\" Poor - at least two criteria not met N.B. For a criterion to have been \"m et,\" it must be scored as \"yes\" ( -analyses, the two applicable quality subsections (5c and 5d) are counted as a single quality criterion. Therefore, to meet the fifth quality criterion for meta -analyses , both 5c and 5d must be scored \"yes\" ( ).

The Rating of Recommendation column denotes the strength of the recommendation as stated by the seed guideline (see Table J.5). 3. The bolded integers in the columns under the Supporting Evidence (rightmost) section of the table represent the total number of discrete studies of that type cited by the guideline to support its recommendation. Thus, when there are multiple publications for a single study, the integers are less than the number of references listed below them. 4. The recommendations from the 2nd Edition of the Alberta CPG are bolded in the tables. The nature of the recommendations from the new seed guidelines relative to the 1st Edition of the Alberta CPG is noted in italics in the leftmost column as either providing Additional infor mation or a New recommendation . 5.

However, studies are currently underway that may add further support. Therefore, we suggest consideration of the clinical prediction rule in the category of early low back pain patients. Clinical prediction rule - patients with four or more of the following criteria have a greater likelihood of success (>90%) with spinal man ipulation (see glossary in Table J.6): Duration of symptoms <16 days At least one hip with less than 35 degrees of medial (internal) rotations Lumbar hypomobility No symptoms distal to the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire work subscale score <19 (see glossary in Table J.6) Weak recommendation - Low quality evidence 1 1 1 2,3 1 4 Evaluate for fracture New statement/ recommendation G2c (USA) (p. 27) Imaging may be considered for low back pain when fracture is suspected.

It may be helpful to use epidural steroid injections for patients with radicular pain for longer than 6 weeks who have not responded to first line treatments. Fluoroscopy improves/verifies accuracy. Even in the most experienced hands, epidural injections can be misp laced. Adverse effects are infrequent and include headache, fever, subdural penetration and more rarely epidural abscess and ventilatory depression. Not applicable 5 10-14 4 15-18 5 19-23 Epidural steroids (acute low back pain: 1 to 6 weeks' duration) Discordant recommendation G2c (USA) (p. 29) Epidural steroid injections may be used for acute low back pain with radicular component to assist with short -term pain relief. Additional notes (pages 30-31 of G2c) : Patient selection for epidurals: Patients typically have symptoms of radicular pain. Examination findings for radiculopathy (reflex changes, possible motor weakness , and root tension signs) need not be present. In addition, the pain should be of a severity that significantly limits function and quality of life, and that has not responded to oral analgesic medications and other conservative care measures. Advanced imaging is required - either magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography to rule out other causes of pain (e.g., infection, cancer). Steroid injections s hould not be given for two weeks following the flu vaccine. Also wait for one month after a steroid injection to receive the flu vaccine. Therapeutic corticosteroid injections may temporarily suppress the body's immune response Weak recommendation - Moderate quality evidence 2 24,25 3 26-28 Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument APPENDIX J 98 Item Guideline/Country/Synopsis of Recommendation Supporting Evidence SR/ MA NR RCT NRCS CS G Other and may compromise the abili ty to develop the expected immune protection from a flu vaccine. This is based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and the International Spine Intervention Society. Patients should have no contraindications to an injection, including t hese: - No signs or symptoms of active infection either systemically or locally . - No history of bleeding disorders or current use of anticoagulants such as warfarin or clopidogrel . Epidural injections carry a higher risk of bleeding. Patients taking anti -thrombotics have an increased risk, and the standard of care should be followed. Guidelines have been developed to limit the risk. Assessment of the risk versus benefit should be done prior to the procedure. Consult with the individual performing the procedure for appropriate anticoagulation guidelines. Patients with non-anaphylactic reaction to iodine-based contrast may still be treated. Consult with the provider performing the procedure. Those with documented anaphylaxis to iodine-based contrast can be treat ed with a non-iodine based contrast such as gadolinium. No allergies to local anesthetic agents, contrast agents , or corticosteroids . No prior complications to corticosteroid injections . Pregnancy is a contraindication due to the use of fluoroscopy . Use caution in diabetic patients because of altered glycemic control, which is typically transient. Patients with diabetes need to be informed and aware that their blood glucose levels will rise and alterations in sliding scales will likely be needed.

Grade I (Insufficient evidence) 1 93 3 87,88,94 3 90,95,96 (p. 18) There is a relative paucity of high quality studies on advanced imaging in patients with lumbar disc herniation. It is the opinion of the work group that in patients with history and physical examination findings consistent with lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy, MRI be considered as the most appropriate, noninvasive test to confirm the presence of lumbar disc herniation. In patients for whom MRI is either contraindicated or inconclusive, CT or CT myelography are the next most appropriate tests to confirm the presence of lumbar disc herniation.

Grade A 1 100 2 97,98 (p. 19) Electrodiagnostic studies may have utility in diagnosing nerve root compression though lack the ability to differentiate between lumbar disc herniation and other causes of nerve root compression. When the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy is suspected, it is the work group's opinion that cross -sectional imaging be considered the diagnostic test of choice and electrodiagnostic studies should only be used to confirm the presence of comorbid conditions . Based on consensus of Guideline Development Group (p. 19) Somatosensory evoked potentials are suggested as an adjunct to cross -sectional imaging to confirm the presence of nerve root compression but are not specific to the level of nerve root compression or the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy. Grade B 1 101 2 102,103 (p. 20) Electromyography, nerve conduction studies , and F - waves are suggested to have limited utility in the diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy.

S95) caudal epidural, interlaminar epidural, and transforaminal injections is disc herniation or radiculitis; fair for axial or discogenic pain without disc herniation, radiculitis or facet joint pain with caudal and epidural injections, and limited post with caudal epidural injections and limited with transforaminal epidural injections. The recommendation for epidural injections for disc herniation is that one of the three approaches may be used; for spinal stenosis any of the three approaches are recommended; whereas for axial or discogenic pain, either lumbar interlaminar or caudal epidural injections are recommended. However for transforaminal the evidence is limited for axial or discogenic pain and post -surgery syndrome. Note 1: Table includes information only for disc herniation and radiculitis and axial or discogenic pain. Note 2: The guidel ine provides algorithms and includes information about complications as follows: Complications related to caudal epidural injections are rare. The common complications are related to either the needle placement or to the drug activity. These include infect ion either local or epidural, abscess, discitis, intravascular injection either intravenous cord infarction, extra epidural placement with subcutaneous injection, subdural injection, dural puncture with pos t lumbar puncture headache, nerve damage, intracranial air injection or increased intracranial pressure, pulmonary embolism, and adverse effects of steroids. The commonly described complications of interlaminar epidural injections are related either to the needle placement or drug administration.

One potentially serious complication of the epidural injection is epidural hematomas in patients with or without evidence of any bleeding tendency, anticoagulation, or traumatic needle insertion. Neurological injuries, though rare, could be devastating and are related to needle trauma, intraarticular injection, toxic effects of steroids, bleeding, and infection. Other complications include increased pain, seizures, chemical meningitis, dural puncture, disc puncture, subdural air, pneumocephalus, transient blindness, retinal necrosis, chorioretinopathy, hiccups, flushing, and arterial gas embolism. The major theoretical complications of corticosteroid administration include suppression of pituitary adrenal axis, hypercorticism, Cushing's syndrome, osteoporosis, bone, steroid myopathy, epidural lipom atosis, weight gain, fluid retention, and hyperglycemia. An evaluation of 10,000 fluoroscopically guided epidural injections, showed intravascular and return of blood in 0.5%, profuse bleeding and dural puncture in 0.8%, local hematoma and transient nerve root irritation in 0.28%, postlumbar puncture headache in 0.07%, and facial flushing in 0.13% with lumbar interlaminar epidural injections. Radiation exposure is also a potential problem with damage to eyes, skin, and gonads. The most common and worrisome complications of transforaminal epidural steroid injections in the lumbar spine, though rare, are related to neural trauma, vascular trauma, intravascular injection, and infection. None of the studies included in an effectiveness analysis showed any major complications. However, transforaminal injections have been reported with complications including spinal cord injury and infarction and paraplegia.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific kind of exercise, or the frequency/intensity of training. Clinical experience suggests that supervised or monitored therapeutic exercise may be useful following an individualized assessment by a spine care specialist. For patients whose pain is exacerbated by physical activity and exercise, refer to a physical therapist, chiropractor, osteopathic physician, or ph ysician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine for therapeutic exercise recommendations. Patients should discontinue any activity or exercise that causes spread of symptoms (peripheralization). Self -treating with an exercise program not specifically d esigned for the patient may aggravate symptoms. Not applicable 10 1-10 4 11-14 9 15-23 Exercise for treatment (subacute low back pain: 7 to 12 weeks' duration) Discordant recommendation G2c (USA) (p. 25) Exercise is recommended in the treatment of subacute low back pain. Additional note: The use of a progressive exercise plan in the treatment of subacute low back pain is supported. Progressive exercise is based on a number of variables that include but are not limited to increasing physical activity, education regarding pain and exercise program that is graded with de- emphasis on pain. Strong recommendation - Moderate quality evidence 2 7,9 2 24,25 Clinical prediction rule for spinal manipulative therapy G2c (USA) (p. 22) At this point evidence is not sufficient to strongly recommend the clinical prediction rule.

Therefore, we suggest consideration of the clinical prediction rule in the category of early low back pain patients. Clinical prediction rule - patients with four or mor e of the following criteria have a greater likelihood of success (>90%) with spinal manipulation: Duration of symptoms <16 days At least one hip with less than 35 degrees of medial (internal) rotations Lumbar hypomobility No symptoms distal to the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire work subscale score <19 (see Appendix D of G2c) (See glossary in Table J.6 for definitions of spinal manipulative therapy and fear -avoidance beliefs.) *References for the seed guidelines are available in Appendix H .

In contrast a third systematic review found moderate evidence that multidisciplinary treatment is superior compared to no treatment or other active treatments (e.g. , physiotherapy) for reduction in short term pain intensity but moderate quality evidence of no differences in long term pain. There is no demonstrable effect that multidisciplinary treatment improves functional status or disability for patients with CLBP. Not applicable 3 31,32,33 Education New recommendation G11 (UK) (p.21) Brief education should be given to patients with chronic pain to help patients continue to work.

Not applicable Discordant recommendation G11 (UK) (p.25) Manual therapy should be considered for short term relief of pain for patients with chronic low back pain. (See glossary in Table J.6 for definition of manual therapy.) Note: one SR referenced in support of the recommendation focuses on massage therapy. B 3 33,40,41 Physical exercise Alberta CPG 2nd Edition (p.15) (Based on G6) Patients should be encouraged to initiate gentle exercise and to gradually increase the exercise level within their pain tolerance. Sophisticated equipment is not necessary. Low cost alternatives include unsupervised walking and group exercise programs, such as those offered by chronic disease management program s. The peer support of group exercise is likely to result in better outcomes, giving patients improved confidence and empowering them to manage with less medical intervention. When exercise exacerbates the patient's pain, the exercise program should be assessed by a qualified physical therapist or exercise specialist. If exercise persistently exacerbates their pain, patients should be further assessed by a physician to determine if further investigation, medication, treatment, or consultation is required. Some studies reported mild negative reactions to exercise programs, such as increased low back pain and muscle soreness in some patients.

NA 2 30,43 Opioids Alberta CPG 2nd Edition (p. 17) (Based on G6, IHE Database) Long -term use of weak opioids, like codeine, should only follow an unsuccessful trial of non - opioid analgesics. In severe chronic pain, opioids are worth careful consideration. Long acting opioids can establish a steady state blood and tissue level that may minimize the patient's experience of increased pain from medication withdrawal experienced with short acting opioids. Careful attention to incremental changes in pain intensity, function, and side effects is required to achieve optimal benefit. Because little is known about the long -term effects of opioid therapy, it should be monitored carefully. Opioid side -effects (including headache, nausea, somnolence, constipation, dry mouth, and dizziness) should be high in the differential diagnosis of new complaints. A history of addiction is a relative contraindication. Consultation with an addictions specialist may be helpful in these cases.

The work group is confident that the desirable effects of adhering to this recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects. This is a strong recommendation for or against. This applies to most patients. The work group recognizes that the evidence, though of high quality, shows a balance between estimates of harms and benefits. The best action w ill depend on local circumstances, patient values or preferences. Moderate quality e vidence Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. The work group is confident that the benefits outweigh the risks, but recognizes that the evidence has limitations. Further evidence may impact this recommendation. This is a recommendation that likely applies to most patients. The work group recognizes that there is a balance between har ms and benefit, based on moderate quality evidence, or that there is uncertainty about the estimates of the harms and benefits of the proposed intervention that may be affected by new evidence. Alternative approaches will likely be better for some patients under some circumstances. Low quality evid ence Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change. The estimate or any estimate of effect is very uncertain. The work group feels that the evidence consistently indicates the benefit of this action outweighs the harms. This recommendation might change when higher quality evidence becomes available. The work group recognizes that there is significant uncertainty about the best estimates of benefits and harms. G9 (USA) As recommended by the IOM, for each recommendation, information was provided with an explanation of the reasoning underlying the recommendation, including a clear description of potential benefits and harms; a summary of relevant available evidence, description of the quality, quantity, and consistency of the aggregate available evidence; an explanation of the part played by values, opinion, theory, and clinical experience in deriving the recommendations; a rati ng of the level of confidence, a rating of the strength of recommendation, and a description and explanation of any differences of opinion regarding the recommendation. In grading recommendations, the grading of recommendations from US Preventive Services Task Force was utilized as follows: Good Evidence includes consistent results from well -designed, well -conducted studies in representative populations that directly assess effects on health outcomes (at least 2 consistent, higher -quality randomized controlled trials or studies of diagnostic test accuracy). Fair Evidence is sufficient to determine effects on health outcomes, but the strength of the evidence is limited by the number, quality, size, or consistency of included studies; generalizability to routine practice; or indirect nature of the evidence on health outcomes (at least one higher -quality trial or study of diagnostic test accuracy of sufficient sample size; 2 or more higher quality trials or studies of diagnostic test accuracy with some i nconsistency; at least 2 consistent, lower -quality trials or studies of diagnostic test accuracy, or multiple consistent observational studies with no significant methodological flaws). Limited or poor Evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes because of limited number or power of studies, large and unexplained inconsistency between higher -quality trials, important flaws in trial design or conduct, gaps in the chain of evidence, or lack of information on important health outcomes.

(Source: G10, USA) Manual therapy Manual therapy is an umbrella term that has increasingly been adopted to encompass various forms of hands -on treatment, including both manipulation and mobilization. Mobilization techniques involve the therapist applying slow, passive movements to a joint; typically the patient cannot perform these movements independently but they are within the normal physiological range of motion of the joint. Manipulation is a passive technique where the therapist applies a specifically directed manual thrust to a joint, at or near the end of the physiological range of motion. This may be accompanied by an audible 'crack' or 'pop'. Manual therapy as a treatment option in the management of pain is an intervention that is practised by a variety of healthcare professionals including physi otherapists, osteopaths , and chiropractors. Philosophical differences exist both within and between the various professions regarding the possible mechanisms of action of manual therapy.

However, the recommendation from the new seed guideline, G9, appears to relate only to medial branch blocks. Therefore, additional systematic review evidence was sought on lumbar facet joint blocks. New statement/recommendation Diagnostic lumbar facet joint nerve blocks (chronic LBP) G9 (USA) (p. S122) The evidence for diagnostic lumbar facet joint nerve blocks is good with 75% to 100% pain relief as the criterion standard with controlled local anesthetic or placebo blocks. Diagnostic lumbar facet joint nerve blocks are recommended in patients with suspected facet joint pain. (Based on evidence from 3 case series studies and 18 diagnostic test studies.)

Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument APPENDIX M 183 SECTION A Systematic Reviews on Diagnostic Facet Joint Blocks Retrieved by the IHE Literature Search Inclusion criteria Intervention: diagnostic facet joint blocks. Condition: non -malignant, non -specific chronic low back pain. Duration of pain defined as: o acute and subacute pain: pain <12 weeks; o chronic pain: pain 12 weeks ( The International Association for the Study of Pain [IASP] definition). Target population: patients who were 18 years of age or older. Reviews that refer to adult patients without providing a specific age range were also included. Type of study : systematic reviews. An article was deemed to be a systematic review if it met all of the following criteria as defined by Cook et al. (1997):1 o focused clinical question; o explicit search strategy; o use of explicit, reproducible, and uniformly applied criteria for article selection; o critical appraisal of the included studies using a qu ality tool or checklist; o qualitative or quantitative data synthesis. Publication limits : reviews with a search end date from January 2007 onwards (generally the median shelf life of a systematic review is 7 years).2 Language limits : English. Exclusion criteria Systematic reviews focused on inpatient treatments such as surgical therapies. Systematic reviews focused on diagnosis or treatment of specific causes for low back pain such as referred pain (from abdomen, kidney, ovary, pelvis, bladder) inflammat ory fracture, (osteoporosis, osteomalacia, Paget's disease). Quasi -systematic reviews and narrative reviews. A review was considered to be quasi - systematic if it used a systematic search strategy to identify literature, but did not us e a quality tool or checklist to critically appraise the included studies. Narrative reviews were evidence syntheses that reported neither a systematic search strategy nor a method of appraising the quality of the included studies. Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument APPENDIX M 184 Literature selection p rocess Articles were excluded that, on the basis of their abstract, clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria. Copies of the full text of potentially eligible studies were retrieved. In some cases, when the full text of the article was retrieved, closer examination revealed that it did not meet the inclusion criteria specified by the protocol. Consequently these papers were excluded (Appendix A.1). When two or more systematic reviews had identical comparators and patient populations, only the most recently published review was included, unless it was less comprehensive and of poorer quality than the earlier review. For reference, when there were no systematic reviews a vailable on the topic of interest, a summary of the conclusions from excluded quasi -systematic reviews was provided, when available. Literature search strategy The abstracts of English language articles of possible systematic reviews focused on low back pain published from January 2007 to April 2014 were reviewed. The search strategy is outlined in Appendix A.2 for your information. References 1. Cook DJ, Mulrow CD, Haynes RB. Systematic reviews: Synthesis of best evidence for clinica l decisions.

(2012)1 USA Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of lumbar facet joint nerve blocks in the assessment of chronic low back pain (LBP) Studies reviewed: Diagnostic accuracy (n=22); factors influencing diagnostic accuracy (n=23) Financial support: Five of the 14 aut hors list ed competing interests involving medical device and pharmaceutical companie s Methodological qu al ity: G ood (score 5/6)* Included patients: Not stated Condition: Chronic LBP 3 mont hs' durat ion Age: At least 18 years Race: Not stated Inclusion criteria: Diagnostic accuracy st udies on lumbar facet joint pain in patients w ith chronic LBP w ho were at least 18 years old and had failed previous pharmacotherapy, exercise therapy, etc., prior to starting diagnost ic interventional pain management techniques E xclusion criteria: Reports w ithout appropriate diagnosis, non- systematic review s, book chapters, and case reports; Interventional techniques performed blindly or using other identification modalities Inde x test: Lumbar facet joint nerve blocks appropria tely performed with proper t echnique under fluoroscopic or compute d t omography guidance N.B.

Single blocks : 50% to 74% relief criterion (n=1 study ) : Prevalence = 48%; -positive range t o 66% 75% to 100% relief criterion (n=4 studies) : Prevalence range = 31% to 61%, false -positive range = 27% t o 49% Dual blocks : 50% to 74% relief criterion (5 studies) : Prevalence range = 15% to 61%; false -positive range = 17% to 66% 75% to 100% relief criterion (13 studies) : Prevalence range = 25% to 45%; false -positive range = 25% to 49% in hete rogene ous populations S afe ty: Complications from facet joint nerve blocks in the lumbar spine are exceedingly rare. Most problems such as local swelling, pain at the site of the needle insertion, and pain in the low back are short - lived and self -limited. More serious complications may include dural punct ure, spinal cord t rauma, subdural injection, neural inject ion into and formation; infectious complications including epidural abscess and bacterial meningitis; and side effects related to the administration of steroids, local anesthetics, and ot her drugs. Other minor complica tions include light- headedness, flushing, sweat ing, nausea, hypotension, syncope, pain at the injection site, and non -postural headaches. Authors' conclusions: There is good evidence for diagnostic face t joint ne rve blocks w ith 75% to 100% pain relief as t he criterion standard with dual blocks, whereas there is fair evidence with 50% to 74% criterion standard with controlled diagnostic blocks . How eve r, the evidence is poor w ith single diagnostic blocks of 50% to 74%a nd limited for 75% to 100% pain relief as t he criterion st andard. Analysis of confounding factors on prevalence and false -positive rates showed the following: Limited evidence that the prevalence of facet joint pain is higher in women, the elderly, and obese patients. The prevalence of facet joint pain is lower in patients with post- laminectomy syndrome and fusion than in non- surgical patients. No detectable difference in prevalence between patients who smoke and those who don't. There w as no significant correla tion w ith psychopathology and pr evalence of facet joint pain or false -positive rate. 1Falco FJ, Manchikanti L, Datta S, Sehgal N, Geffert S, Onyewu O, et al.

Acute and subacute low back pain Pain present for less than three months. Back schools An intervention consisting of education and a skills program, including exercise therapy, in which all lessons are given to groups of patients and supervised by a paramedical therapist or medical specialist. Behavioural treatment There are three behavioural treatment approaches: operant, cognitive, and respondent. Each of these focuses on the modification of one of the three response systems that characterize emotional experiences: behaviour, cognition, and physiological reactivity. Brief education in a clinical setting Brief education in clinical setting is defined as review of the patient's clinical examination results, provision of low back pain information and advice to stay active, and reduction of fear and catastrophizing. Catastrophizing Exaggerating the potential or real consequences of an event and becoming fearful of these consequences. Chronic low back pain Pain present for more than three months. Cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) A range of therapies based on psychological models of human cognition, learning and behaviour that are usually taught as a \"package\" and are intended to provide patients with a variety of skills for managing their pain. Craniosacral therapy An alternative treatment approach that involves applying a gentle manual force to address somatic dysfunctions of the head and body, with the aim of releasing restrictions around the spinal cord and brain and restoring body function. Electrodiagnostic st udies Studies performed in the electromyography (EMG) laboratory, including nerve conduction studies, F -waves, somatosensory evoked potentials, and EMG. Electromyography (EMG) The recording of electrical activity generated in skeletal muscle for diagnostic purposes. EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram. Exercise Therapeutic exercises are prescribed according to the results of an individual patient assessment. Recommendations are based on the specific impairments identified. Supervised exercise programs and formal home exercise regimens range from programs aimed at general physical fitness or aerobic exercise to programs aimed at muscle strengthening, flexibility, stretching, or different combinations of these elements. Facet joint injection Injection of local anesthetic, with or without corticosteroid medication, into one or more of the small joints along the sides of each vertebrae to diagnose or treat low back pain associated with facet joint dysfunction. See also the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology . Functional restoration (also called physical conditioning, work hardening, or work conditioning) An intervention that involves simulated or actual work tests in a supervised environment in order to enhance job performance skills and improve strength, endurance, flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness in injured workers. Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument APPENDIX 194 ion (also called multidisciplinary therapy ) A biopsychosocial intervention that combines and coordinates physical, vocational, and behavioural components and is provided by multiple health care professionals with different clinical backgrounds. The intens ity and content of interdisciplinary therapy varies widely. Interferential current therapy The superficial application of a medium -frequency alternating current modulated to produce low frequencies up to 150 Hz. It is thought to increase blood flow to t issues and provide pain relief and is considered more comfortable for patients than transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Intramuscular stimulation Uses very thin needles to 'dry needle' affected areas without the injection of any substance. IMS differs from acupuncture in its application because needle insertion is indicated by physical signs as opposed to the predetermined meridians of acupuncture. IMS is based on known scientific, neurophysiological principles. Low-level laser therapy The superficial application of lasers at wavelengths between 632 and 904 nm to the skin in order to apply electromagnetic energy to soft tissue. Optimal treatment parameters (wavelength, dosage, dose-intensity, and type of laser) are uncertain. Lumbar di sc herniation with radiculopathy Localized displacement of disc material beyond the normal margins of the intervertebral disc space resulting in pain, weakness or numbness in a myotomal or dermatomal distribution. Lumbar discography Procedure that is used to characterize the pathoanatomy and architecture of the intervertebral disc and to determine if the intervertebral disc is a source of chronic low back pain. Lumbar supports External devices designed to reduce spinal mobility. Manual therapy Manual therapy (MT) is an umbrella term that has increasingly been adopted to encompass various forms of hands -on treatment, including both manipulation and mobilization (see Spinal manipulative therapy and Spinal mobilization). Manual therapy as a treatment option in the management of pain is an intervention that is practiced by a variety of healthcare professionals including physiotherapists, osteopaths, and chiropractors. Philosophical differences exist both within and between the various professions regarding the possible mechanisms of action of manual therapy. Massage Soft tissue manipulation using the hands or a mechanical device through a variety of specific methods. The pressure and intensity used in different massage techniques vary widely. Medial branch block An injection of local anesthetic, with or without corticosteroid medication, in the area of the medial branch of the posterior primary ramus, the primary nerve innervating the intervertebral facet joint, to diagnose or treat back pain. See also the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology . Mindfulness The skill of non-judgmentally observing emotions, sensations, or cognitions (moment - to-moment awareness). It is learned through meditation exercises that have been adapted from Buddhist traditions. Motorized traction An intervention involving drawing or pulling in order to stretch the lumbar spine. Various methods are used, usually involving a harness around the lower rib cage and the iliac crest, with the pulling action done by using free weights and a pulley, motorized equipment, inversion techniques, or an overhead harness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) An imaging technique used to image internal structures of the body, particularly the soft tissues without use of radiation. Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument APPENDIX O 195 Term Definition Multidisciplinary therapy (multidisciplinary treatment programs) See Interdisciplinary rehabilitation. Nonspecific low back pain Pain occurring primarily in the back with no signs of a serious underlying condition (such as cancer, infection, or Cauda Equina Syndrome), spinal stenosis or radiculopathy, or another specific spinal cause (such as vertebral compression fracture or ankylosing spondylitis). Degenerative changes on lumbar imaging are usually considered nonspecific, as they correlate poorly with symptoms. Osteopathic physician The training of osteopathic physicians incorporates the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal conditions. Osteopathic manual therapy, including manipulation, can be an important part of treatment. Physiotherapy provided operant conditioning Operant conditioning is defined as a time contingent, graduated increase in activity including goal setting and the education and reinforcement of positive pain behaviours with the ultimate aim of decreasing disability and increasing f unction. Prevention of occurrence of low back pain Reduction of the incidence (first -time onset) of low back pain or the risk of new cases appearing, i.e., primary prevention. Prevention of recurrence of low back pain Reduction of the occurrence of a new episode of low back pain after a symptom -free period in patients who have previously experienced low back pain, i.e., secondary prevention. Progressive (muscle) relaxation A technique that involves the deliberate tensing and relaxation of muscles to facilitate the recognition and release of muscle tension. Prolotherapy Injections of irritant solutions to strengthen lumbosacral ligaments. Proton pump inhibitor A type of drug that reduces the production of acid in the stomach, and is used to treat indigestion and stomach ulcers. Radiculopathy Dysfunction of a nerve root associated with pain, sensory impairment, weakness, or diminished deep tendon reflexes in a nerve root distribution. The most common symptom of lumbar radiculopathy is sciatica. Radiofrequency neurotomy Application of a high-frequency electrical current via an electrode to spinal nerves to destroy nerve function and interrupt pain signals to the brain. Also known as radiofrequency ablation. See also the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology . Red flags Clinical (i.e. , physical) features that may alert to the presence of serious but relatively uncommon conditions or diseases requiring evaluation. Such conditions include tumours, infection, frac tures, and neurological damage/ disease. Respondent therapy using EMG biofeedback A therapy aimed at modifying physiological response to pain by reducing muscular tension. It is based on the idea of a pain-tension cycle, where pain is viewed as both a cause and a r esult of muscular tension. Respondent therapy attempts to interrupt this cycle by using a tension-incompatible reaction, such as relaxation. EMG biofeedback is frequently used to reduce the assumed muscular tension, relieve anxiety, and subsequently pain (see Electromyography [EMG]). Sacroiliac joint block An injection of local anesthetic, with or without corticosteroid medication, into the sacroiliac joint to diagnose or treat low back pain associated with sacroiliac joint dysfunction. See also the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology . Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument APPENDIX O 196 Term Definition Sciatica Pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back, through the buttock, and down the back of the leg. Sciatica can be caused by irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve. Selective nerve root block (SNRB) An inj ection of local anesthetic, with or without other substances such as corticosteroid medication, along a specific nerve root that exits from the spinal cord to diagnose or treat nerve root pain in the back. Also known as selective transforaminal epidural injection. See also the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology . Shock-wave treatment Application of low -frequency sound waves (10, 50, 100, or 250 Hz) to the skin, causing an oscillatory pressure in the underlying soft tissue. Also commonly known as vibrotherapy . Short -wave diathermy Therapeutic elevation of the temperature of deep tissues by application of short -wave electromagnetic radiation with a frequency range from 10-100 MHz. Spa therapy An intervention involving several interventions, including mineral water bathing, usually with heated water, and other interventions such as massage and exercise, typically while staying at a spa resort. Spinal care specialist A physical therapist, chir opractor, osteopathic physician, or physician who specializes in musculoskeletal medicine. Spinal manipulative therapy Application of high-velocity, low -amplitude manual thrusts to the spinal joints slightly beyond the passive range of joint motion. This may be accompanied by an audible 'crack' or 'pop'. Spinal mobilization Application of manual force to the spinal joints within the passive range of joint motion that does not involve a thrust. Spinal stenosis A condition in which there is diminished space available for the neural and vascular elements in the lumbar spine, secondary to degenerative changes in the spinal canal. When symptomatic, this causes a variable clinical syndrome of gluteal and/or lower extremity pain and/or fatigue, which may occur with or without back pain. See also the companion document Radiological Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Directed to Lumbar Spine Pathology . TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) Use of a small, battery -operated device to provide continuous electrical impulses via surface electrodes, with the goal of providing symptomatic relief by modifying pain perception. Therapeutic aquatic exercise Active exercise in warm water; such as aqua-aerobics and aqua-jogging. Therapeutic ultrasound The use of, externally applied sound waves to generate heat within specific parts of the body. Trigger point injection An injection of fluid directly into a hyperirritable area of muscle or soft tissue (trigger point) that is tender when compressed and can give rise to referred pain. Also known as direct wet needling. Touch therapies Touch therapies are defined as energy based complementary therapies including healing touch, therapeutic touch, and Reiki. Yellow flags Psychosocial and sociological factors that increase the risk of developing or perpetuating long-term disability and w ork loss associated with low back pain. Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument APPENDIX O 197 Term Definition Yoga An intervention distinguished from traditional exercise therapy by the use of specific body positions, breathing techniques, and an emphasis on mental focus. Many styles of yoga are practiced, each emphasizing different postures and techniques. Iyengar yoga: A type of hatha yoga; make use of a variety of props so that perfect alignment is obtained regardless of physical limitations. Viniyoga: A type of hatha yoga customized by the practitioner for each individual. Other types of hatha yoga include: Ashtanga, Kripalu, Bikram, Anusara.

Thus, recommendations were classified as \" Do\" when the original guideline recommended or provided a prescriptive direction to perform the action, or used the term \"effective\" to describe it. The seed guidelines used different systems to grade or categorize the level of evidence supporting each recommen dation and the strength or type of recommendation made. However, generally all of the guidelines recommended an action or described it as effective when this statement was supported by: results from at least one study of strong design for answering the question addressed, generally consistent results from multiple studies of strong design for answering the question addressed, or the clinical experience of the Guideline Development Group (GDG) . Recommendations not sourced f rom seed guidelines New recommen dations were classified as \"Do\" when a supplementary literature search found at least one relevant systematic review presenting consistent evidence to support the action from a minimum of two critically appraised primary studies of at least moderate qualit y (as assessed by the authors of the review) or five primary studies of undefined quality.* Expert Opinion When the G UC supplemented a recommendation or created a new one based on expert opinion, it was classified \"Do\" when the collective professional opin ion of the GUC supported the action. DO NOT DO (Not Recommended) Recommendations sourced f rom seed guidelines When the GUC accepted the gist of the original recommendation in the seed guideline(s), the original wording was preserved where possible. Thus, recommendations were classified as \" Do Not Do\" when the original guideline recommended against or provided a prescriptive d irection not to perform the action, used the term \"ineffective\" to describe it, or stated that the evidence did \"not support\" it. The seed guidelines used different systems to grade or categorize the level of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength or type of recommendation made.

DO NOT KNOW Recommendations sourced f rom seed guidelines When the GUC accepted the gist of the original recommendation in the seed guideline(s), the original wording was preserved where possible. Thus, recommendations were classified as \" Do Not Know \" when the original guideline did not recommend for or against the action or stated that there was \"no evidence\", \"insufficient or conflicting evidence\", or \"no good evidence\" to support its use. The seed guidelines used different systems to grade or categorize the level of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength or type of recommendation made. However, generally all of the guidelines stated that evidence for a particular action was lacking or insufficient when: effectiveness was demonstrated in a general sense but not specifically for back pain, the studies were o f poor quality, inappropriately designed to answer the question addressed, or presented conflicting results, which precluded the determination of effectiveness or the balance of benefits and harms, only one study of any design was available, or no studies of any design were available. Recommendations not sourced f rom seed guidelines New recommendations were classified as \" Do Not Know \" and worded as follows. \"There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against\" the action: when a supplementary literat ure search found no relevant systematic reviews. \"There is inconclusive evidence to recommend for or against\" the action: when a supplementary literature search found at least one relevant systematic review presenting evidence from primary studies that wer e of poor quality, exhibited significant heterogeneity in the populations studied or methods used, were inappropriately designed to answer the question addressed, or presented conflicting or equivocal results.

Imaging to rule out underlying pathology in the absence of radiculopathy (acute and subacute LBP) Yes: 5; No: 1 The third bullet leaves the field wide open to order an MRI for anyone with increasing pain and poor response to the usual treatment... many patients. Are there any circumstances where this recommendation would come into play to catch patients that really should be imaged that the other bullets (recommendations) don't cover? If not, can we eliminate it? Referral for inflammatory disease (acute and subacute LBP) Yes: 5; No: 1 Does this mean that clinical indicators are not valuable when determining if a referral is necessary? Therapeutic exercise (acute and subacute LBP) Yes: 5; No: 1 Individualized specific is redundant - individualized is enough. Marijuana (dried cannabis) (acute and subacute LBP) Yes: 6; No: 0 This fits correctly into your evidence categories. I still think in circumstances with this type of evidence [\"do not know\"] there still could be a recommendation made either to do or not do something. This would require a revision of your evidence categories that could be considered for future guidelines.* Clinical prediction rule for spinal manipulative therapy (acute and subacute LBP) Yes: recommendations therapy No: 1 Why is tapentadol included in the same guideline as other physical modalities? *See previous comment\"do not know\" recommendations Education (chronic LBP) 6; No: 0 Perhaps this could be acc ompanied by some knowledge translation tools for patients. Diagnostic selective nerve root blocks (SNRBs) in primary care (chronic LBP) Yes: 5; No: 1 I find this a bit confusing. Primary care physicians don't technically do EMGs or MRIs either, but they're ordered for other physicians to perform with the clinical acumen that accompanies that responsibility. With this in mind the recommendation should be a \"do\". Diagnostic lumbar facet joint nerve blocks (chronic *See previous *See previous comment\"do screening tool (chronic LBP) Yes: 5; No: 1 Will there be a reference to the STarT back tool in the guidelines for interested physicians?

Do you agree that the above recommendation be removed? Laboratory testing (chronic LBP) Yes: 5; No: 1 Why? I will leave this to the physicians, but it sounds reasonable. Please provide any comments you have about the medication table. (3 comments) It is my understanding that there are new Canadian guidelines about the use of diclofenac >50 mg twice a day. Has this been considered? I would like to add that a maximum dose equivalent of 60 mg is required before any fentanyl patch can be started. I'm wondering if we should change the dose of acetaminophen in the acute and chronic table to 650 mg to 1,000 mg up to four times/day (maximum of 3,000 mg/day for chronic use). There is a lot of 650 mg use in the community in Edmonton, especially due to the long-acting formulation. If you have any further comments on any of the sections reviewed in this survey and/or anything from the emailed full guideline draft not reviewed in this survey (e.g. the preamble or appendices), please provide them below. (1 comme nt) I have a concern about the chronic LBP recommendation and medical marijuana as a \"do not know\". This contradicts recent statements that the only clear indications for medicinal marijuana in chronic pain is for neuropathic pain and spasticity from multi ple sclerosis. 1 EMG: electromyograph; LBP: low tava coming storm.

TABLE S.2: Barriers to implementing the Alberta CPG recommendations - summary of responses from Guideline Update Committee and Subcommittee members (n=6) Question Feedback In your practice setting, are there barriers to the implementation of these recommendations that we should be aware of? Imaging to rule out underlying pathology in the absence of radiculopathy (acute and subacute LBP) Yes: 1; No: 5 Timely access to MRI, particularly for injection therapy as a short -term tre atment. Referral for inflammatory disease (acute and subacute LBP) Yes: 1; No: 5 In the Edmonton zone we can only order either a CRP or ESR, not both. Therapeutic exercise (acute and subacute LBP) Yes: 1; No: 5 Referral to a physical therapist frequently r esults in advice that contradicts the advice given in this guideline.

Lumbar discography in primary care (chronic LBP) Yes: 2; No: 4 This test is generally not available in Calgary, although I support the \"do not do\" recommendation. In my practice I see a small percentage of patients with LBP (non-radicular) that are considering stem cell injections (intradiscal). Cl inically, specialists will not consider these injections without performing a discogram first. The addition of \"it exposes patients and physicians to radiation\", although relevant may be a bit extreme. Many other interventional pain procedures expose patients and physicians to radiation as imaging TABLE S.3: Feedback on the 2 -page guideline summary from participants at the annual Calgary Pain Conference Workshop (Calgary, Canada) , 3 December 2015 (n=8 surveys + 1 feedback on algorithm) Question Feedback Is the summary guideline easy to read? There is a lot of information in 2 short pages, but the set -up of the document is easy to read and navigate. Yes, easy to follow. Does contain substantial amount of information, but seems to be well organized. Another five participants answered \"Yes\". Do you see any errors? Not able to compare to anything else, therefore no. \"c\" at contraindications. Another 5 participants answered \"No\". Do you see any surprises? The encouragement and support for pain self -management. So happy to see this as a focus. Diagram (happy face drawing). Indications for imaging; imaging is currently overused. Diclofenac versus ketorolac or other NSAIDs. Another 4 participants answered \"No\". Would you be able to use this in your clinical practice? Yes. We are a radiology practice but have many one-on-one conversations with patients and can sometimes detect yellow flags not initially documented by referring physicians. Yes, as a nursing info sheet for teaching. Used more by primary care providers; not radiology practice. Another 4 participants answered \"Yes\". Can you suggest any improvements? Very comprehensive, thanks for all your hard work. Colours. What to do with patients who will have to get an MRI to enable them to be seen by specialty. It can take up to 8 months to get an MRI done. Another 5 participants answered \"No\". One feedback on algorithm: Delete \"including lab tests and imaging as indicated\"; add \"educate patient\"; add \"butrans (buprenorphine)\". Ambassador Program guideline for the evidence- informed primary care management of low bac k pain, 3rd Edition: Bac kground doc ument APPENDIX S 213 TABLE S.4: Suggestions for improving patient information sheets and brochures from IHE Lay Advisory Committee members (n=8) Task Feedback Provide input on the format, wording, colour, and content of the patient information sheets and brochures The presentation is too busy (e.g. grid at the top, info at the bottom). Is blue the best colour? Is any colour necessary? The simpler the better. Wording could be simplified (one committee member provided notes with specific suggestions for wording and organization). People with limited reading skills would have a hard time, even with the one-pagers. Suggest a large poster with the most impor tant information in simple wording. Could the guideline be combined with the Choosing Wisely Campaign, as they cover come of the same material? Questioned why there was no mention of prevention, e.g. use of good body mechanics, and techniques to relieve c omputer strain. Is there a website to direct people to such information? Don't mention more powerful medications. It is likely to make some people want them even if not necessary. The picture on the detailed package is too vague; it doesn't stand out and i t's difficult to tell that it is a picture of a \"sore back\". In addition to doctors' offices, these should available at, for example, pharmacies, physios, health centres, Workers' Compensation Board, counsellors' offices.
