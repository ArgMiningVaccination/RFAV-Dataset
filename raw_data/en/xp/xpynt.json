The introduction of different types of diffusers has led to an increase in the preference for this equipment as they help gain therapeutic benefits from essential oils.

The ability of candle diffusers, atomizers, and ultrasonic diffusers to provide relaxation, energy enhancement, and relief from anxiety and stress is anticipated to have a positive impact on the demand for aerial diffusion. The relaxation segment led the market for aromatherapy and accounted for 23.7% of the revenue share in 2022, attributed to the rising number of people suffering from anxiety. Aromatherapy oils are effective in relaxing people, which balances the overactive mental state of the consumers. Stress management is also a huge concern for people.
