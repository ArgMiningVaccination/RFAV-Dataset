We continually grow and expand. In our Body Therapy Sessions, the mind/body system moves from an imbalanced state to its normal, or authentic, state. Skin is the largest organ of our body and has immediate effects on the mind, emotions, and physiology. Several different modalities can be added to a session depending on the healing needs of the individual. Crissy is well versed in Neuromuscular Therapy, Abyangha, Pinda, Shirodhara, Chinese Fire Cupping, Gua Sha, Energy Healing, Aromatherapy and Thai massage. Abyahngha - whole body massage with one or two practitioners using powder, medicated oils and/or aromas, performed in a specific manner to encourage strength to the circulatory system, encourage lymphatic flow, and cleanse and stimulate the body's energy centers. There are numerous additions to this therapy like swedana, shirodhara or pinda to personalize your treatments. Swedana - the process of inducing sweat and/or heat therapies with herbal pindas, sweat tents, either as a preparatory component to other therapies or to promote relaxation and detoxification. The Swedana allows for the medicated oils to penetrate into the deeper layers of tissue and for toxins and deep seated imbalances to come to the surface. "}
