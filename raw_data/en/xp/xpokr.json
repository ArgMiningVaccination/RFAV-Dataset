Program Coordinator's GuideProgram Coordinator's GuideProgram Coordinator's Guide1Executive Summary Alcohol and medication misuse and mental health conditions can be significant problems for older adults. Our growing life expectancy, coupled with the aging of the \"baby boom\" generation make the need to address these issues more critical than ever before. As with other age groups, by preventing these problems from occurring in the first place, and by addressing them promptly when they do arise, we can enhance the lives and health of millions of older Americans. The Get Connected Toolkit was created to help health, social, and aging services providers learn more about alcohol and medication misuse and mental health conditions in older adults so they can address these issues more effectively. It has been designed to help health and aging services providers undertake health promotion, advance prevention messages and education, and undertake screening and referral for mental health conditions and the misuse of alcohol and medications. The Get Connected Toolkit helps coordinate these efforts and link your organization and the older adults you serve to other valuable community-based and national resources. The Get Connected Toolkit is the result of public-private partnership between the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the National Council on Aging (NCOA). The organizations met with older adult consumers and health and aging services providers to gather information on how best to engage the aging services network in addressing the alcohol and medication misuse and mental health needs of older adults. The Program Coordinator' s Guide is the key to understanding and using the Toolkit. This guide was developed to increase awareness of alcohol and medication misuse and mental health conditions in older adults. It can instruct health and aging services providers on how to use the Toolkit. This guide provides: An overview of medication, alcohol, and mental health conditions in older adults; A description of the toolkit contents; and A five-step process on how to use the kit to teach staff and older adults about these issues. It may take some time to become comfortable with this Toolkit and get staff on board. However, your efforts will pay off. Greater attention to medication, alcohol, and mental health conditions among older adults can greatly improve the quality of their lives.2 Get ConnectedProgram Coordinator's Guide3Introduction Alcohol and medication misuse and mental health conditions are significant problems for older adults. In fact, substance misuse and abuse among older adults is one of the fastest growing health problems in America. Most people over 65 do not use illegal drugs, but almost 20 percent of older adults misuse alcohol, over-the-counter medicines, and prescription drugs\u2014most often unintentionally. Physiological changes in older adults can render alcohol and medications harmful at doses lower than those used by younger people. Many older adults are unaware of this fact. Few are aware, for example, that the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) recommends that adults ages 65 and older who are healthy and do not take medications drink no more than three alcoholic drinks a day or a maximum of seven drinks per week. Furthermore, NIAAA advises women of any age to drink somewhat less than recommended drinking limits. Women typically experience alcohol-related problems at lower drinking levels, weigh less pound-for-pound and have less water in their bodies, and are more likely to live longer than men. Women who drink are more susceptible to liver damage, heart disease, and breast cancer, and older women may be especially at risk for alcohol problems resulting from loneliness and depression. 1,2 With longer life expectancies, more older adults develop chronic diseases, and therefore more depend on prescription medicines. Although people 65 years of age and older comprise only 13 percent of the population, they account for almost 30 percent of all medications prescribed in the U.S. 3 Many of these prescriptions are for depression and anxiety, and an estimated one in four older adults has symptoms of mental illness in a given year. 4 Perhaps not surprisingly, more than 80 percent of emergency room department visits made by older adults result from adverse drug reactions. 5 Generational differences in attitudes about substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions make it difficult for older adults to seek help. In addition, health care providers often overlook these problems for the following reasons: Signs of treatable mental health conditions and substance misuse and abuse can mimic signs commonly attributed to aging. Many older adults are reluctant to seek help. Unfortunately, many would rather avoid the shame, prejudice, and discrimination associated with substance misuse and abuse and mental health diagnoses. Many people mistakenly believe that these problems are not preventable or worth treating in older adults.4 Get Connected Many people mistakenly believe that symptoms of mental health conditions, such as sadness, depression, and anxiety, are a natural part of the aging process or are a grief response to retirement or loss of a spouse instead of a mental health condition requiring treatment. Personal stereotypes and bias may prevent health and social service providers from screening older adults. Health and social service providers may lack the information and training needed to effectively screen at-risk older adults and refer them to appropriate resources for assistance.The good news is that prevention and treatment of substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions among older adults is possible. By using the materials in the Toolkit, organizations can play an important role in preventing, identifying, screening, educating, and referring at-risk clients for further care. For a relatively low cost, these organizations can help their clients lead more productive and healthier lives. The information in this guide addresses questions and concerns you may have about this program and how you can adapt it for use in your organization.Program Coordinator's Guide5Who Should Use the Get Connected Toolkit? Organizations that provide services to older adults are in the best position to benefit from this program. Their clients know and trust them and their referrals have the greatest likelihood of success in follow-through. These organizations include: Senior centers Adult day care services Nutrition programs State and community agencies Health and social service programs Public housing facilities Veterans programs Coalitions related to older adults Assisted living centers Faith-based organizations The T oolkit provides the materials necessary for training staff who work with older adults. The intent of the training is not to turn staff into prevention and treatment experts. Rather , it is designed to accomplish the following goals: Help staff better understand the issues associated with substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions in older adults; Increase staff confidence and comfort in addressing these problems; and Provide resources to enable staff to screen and refer at-risk clients to an appropriate advisor such as a physician, an alcohol counselor, or a mental health professional. The Toolkit also includes materials to educate older adults. It includes awareness-raising and self-screening tools designed to help them overcome obstacles to seeking help. The Role of the Program Coordinator Your organization should designate a staff member to serve as a program coordinator who will carry out or oversee the program using the materials provided in the Toolkit. The most likely person is someone who handles health promotion and education for staff and clients. Another likely candidate is the person responsible for developing health service agency collaboration, screening, and referrals. In some organizations, the same person may handle both functions. In other organizations, a team approach may work best.6 Get ConnectedProgram Coordinator's Guide7What's in the Get Connected Toolkit? The materials provided in the Toolkit make the program coordinator's job simple. The Toolkit includes everything the coordinator needs to accomplish the following tasks: Determine if the organization is ready, willing, and able to implement the program; Create or enhance the organization'sresource database; Conduct education sessions for staff andolder adults or identify resources to conductthe sessions; andHelp the organization draft a plan for futureprograms. The following chart provides brief descriptions of the Toolkit components. One copy of the fact sheets, screening tools and blank forms is included. Feel free to copy or tailor these items for your program.

Brochures (Links are included) The brochures provide an overview of substance misuse and abuse, mental health conditions, and stress the importance of seeking help. \"As You Age...A Guide to Aging, Medicines, and \"Good Health Is Ageless\": http://store.samhsa.gov/product/Good-Mental-Health-is-Ageless/SMA15-3618 Note: An additional resource, SAMHSA's Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) Series 26, Substance Abuse Among Older Adults: A Guide for Social Services Providers, provides information about substance misuse and abuse among older adults as well as in-depth technical information on diagnosis and treatment. It is available online at the SAMHSA Store at www.store.samhsa.gov.Program Coordinator's Guide9Getting Started: Adapting the Program for Your Organization This program offers your organization an opportunity to provide a service to your clients and to have a positive impact on a growing medical and social problem. But where do you begin? The information in this section will help you determine how to adapt the program to your organization's needs and resources and lay the groundwork for success. Five Steps To Get Connected To help ensure that your organization and clients benefit from this program, follow this five-step process: Step 1: Assess Organizational Strengths and Challenges Step 2: Identify Resources Step 3: Educate Staff Step 4: Educate Older Adults Step 5: Plan Future Developments These steps are designed for use with the materials provided in the Toolkit. As you read through each step, refer to the relevant materials mentioned. Step 1: Assess Organizational Strengths and Challenges How does your organization currently address the needs of at-risk older adults? It is important to know where you are so that you can determine where you are going and how to get there. What obstacles might stand in the way of implementing this program? Assessing challenges will give you the framework to develop strategies to overcome them. This exercise does not need to be laborious or time-consuming. Simply talking to coworkers informally or setting aside some time at a staff meeting can help you address the following five areas. INTEREST/WILLINGNESS Are organization leaders and staff interested or willing to learn more about substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions among older adults? If yes, you have the support to initiate this program. If no, getting buy-in from the leaders or decision makers in your organization is important. Consider putting together a short program using the video and relevant fact sheets from the Toolkit. Encourage open discussion of how your organization can integrate this program.10 Get ConnectedKNOWLEDGE/EDUCATION Has your organization previously addressed substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions among older adults? Have these problems surfaced among the older adults your organization serves? Do any staff members have knowledge or expertise in these matters? If yes, learn what was done, who did it, and what happened as a result. Discuss how to incorporate the toolkit materials with existing materials. If no, familiarize yourself with the problems. Watch the YouTube video, review the fact sheets, and read the publications included in the Toolkit. You can enhance your self-study by seeking additional information or assistance as needed from a local expert. TRAINING/EXPERIENCE Have any staff members received training in substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions? Is there a designated health educator or trainer on staff who can conduct the education sessions? If yes, that staff member can use or adapt the education materials included in the Toolkit. If no, locate a local expert who is willing and able to conduct the sessions and provide the Toolkit materials for his or her use. ORGANIZATIONAL RESOURCES Is staff available to take a leadership role in implementing the program? Are appropriate referrals in place to support this effort? If yes, review your resources to ensure that all referrals are current and appropriate. If no, you may have to do some creative problem solving with leaders in your organization. Draft a wish list outlining what resources and referrals are needed. Refer to the resources list in the Toolkit and brainstorm with staff members to find ways to fill gaps. CHALLENGES/CONSTRAINTS Are any factors working against your effort? Have you met with any resistance? Are there external factors that make it difficult to start the program at this time? If yes, you will have to develop strategies to overcome the challenges and solicit leadership support. Brainstorm with interested staff on ways to address concerns and questions. Use relevant materials from the Toolkit, such as the video or fact sheets, to make your case. If no, you have a green light to proceed. Once you have the go-ahead signal, compile and summarize what you learned about your organization's strengths and challenges. If appropriate, involve additional staff or community members to discuss this information and offer input and ideas. Meet with these individuals to accomplish the following goals: Share findings. What interest, willingness, resources, and referrals exist on which to build an educational program for older adults? Identify gaps. What training, community experts, and referrals are needed to implement the program? Determine the top two or three needs. When will your organization begin to address the substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions of the older adults served? You may also want to ask the group some directed questions for thought, such as the following:Program Coordinator's Guide11 What health issues do you see in older adults that might indicate substance misuse and abuse or mental health conditions? What are the effects of substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions on our clients? Step 2: Identify Resources Identifying resources is an important step in implementing this program. Your organizations must make a connection with one or more people in the community who deal with substance misuse and abuse or mental health conditions, especially among older adults. These individuals can serve as advisors or assist with education, screening, and referrals. Before you take on the task of building your resource database, know what you are looking for. The more concrete you are about the resources and referrals you are seeking, the better. Staff members may have to make several calls to identify people who are willing to make themselves or staff available when needed. Whenever possible, callers should identify multiple resources for each area of expertise. The Toolkit provides the following materials to help you start building your resource database: Two sample forms to help staff collect resource data: one for alcohol and medication resources and one for mental health resources. While all of the questions may not apply to each organization, using the forms will help staff collect uniform information. The Aging-Related Resource List, which contains contact information and brief descriptions for relevant agencies, clearinghouses, and institutes.Following are organizations, individuals, or programs that are good candidates to contact for your resource database: Support groups for older adults dealing with loss and grief Pharmacists Physicians or nurses, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants Gerontologists College or university programs on gerontology, nursing, social work, medical pharmacology, public health, and psychology Psychiatrists (with specialty in geriatrics) Social workers with expertise in aging or substance misuse and abuse Alcohol treatment practitioners Health educators Chemical dependency counselors Alcoholics Anonymous Veterans Administration Area Agency on Aging Health departments Substance use and abuse treatment programs Hospitals Libraries, clearinghouses, and services that offer recorded health messages or access to trained professionals who can answer questions. Consider creating a matrix that indicates area of expertise, contact information, and procedures for requesting assistance. A sample matrix follows. Another option is to enter key information into a searchable database.12 Get ConnectedSAMPLE RESOURCE MATRIX Area of ExpertiseName of OrganizationContact Person and PhoneHow To Request AssistanceWhat the Organization Can Provide Medication Outpatient addiction treatment Geriatric medicine Social work Chemical dependency Mental health conditions Support groupsHealth education/ promotion Training Forming partnerships or other supportive relationships can help establish ongoing access to resources. Developing and maintaining relationships with those to whom you have made referrals can improve the quality of referrals to your organization. Such ongoing contacts may provide opportunities for your organization to set up regular services for older adults. These services could include the following: Seminars Q&A sessions Health check sessions in which a pharmacist comes in to review medications Wellness workshopsStep 3: Educate Staff The program coordinator, a qualified staff member, or a local expert may lead the staff education sessions. The materials in the Toolkit have been designed to make the session leader's job easier, and include the following: Teaching agendas Class outlines with recommended teaching times (Sessions are designed to last 1.5 to 2 hours) A list of materials required to teach the session Tips for preparation and conducting the session effectively Learning objectivesProgram Coordinator's Guide13 Exercises, activities, and suggestions for group discussion A feedback form To enhance the sessions, consider inviting guest speakers drawn from your resource database or the resources list in the Toolkit. Speakers can make presentations in their area of expertise or form a panel to answer questions. Cross-training between staff members and specialists in the community with expertise in age-related health issues is encouraged because it strengthens the ties between organizations. It also improves the referrals that result from such collaboration. Step 4: Educate Older Adults The Toolkit includes materials to educate older adults that are similar to the materials developed for staff education. However, before your organization offers this education, you must consider some basic questions: Who will respond to questions or concerns clients may have about alcohol, medication, or mental health conditions? Does this individual need additional resources to feel comfortable in this role? Are the referrals for assessment and treatment appropriate and current? What follow-up system is in place to ensure that clients get the help they need? Once you feel confident that these questions have been adequately addressed, you are ready to schedule an older adult education session. The Toolkit includes the following materials: A program logistics checklist A sample publicity form to help you advertise the program Teaching agendas Class outlines with recommended teaching times (Sessions are designed to last one hour) A list of materials required to teach the session Tips for preparation and conducting the session effectively Learning objectives Exercises, activities, and suggestions for group discussion A feedback form Some organizations have had success training older adults to provide educational sessions. Recruiting and training a core group of active older adults is challenging. However, peer education is very effective, so it is worth the effort. Step 5: Plan Future Developments To have the greatest impact on the problems affecting at-risk older adults, your organization should continue to use this program on an ongoing basis. A staff meeting to set priorities and assign tasks will help in planning and implementing next steps. Involving staff in the process will help ensure that they are committed to making the program work. Following are some suggested next steps. Evaluate the existing program and assess future needs by asking: How did the sessions go? What worked? What did not work? How can we improve the program? How did staff receive the program? Older adults? What would help older adults most? What would help the organization most?14 Get Connected What types of messages should we include in health promotion efforts? What referral resources are available? What topics must we still cover? Integrate issues related to medication, alcohol, and mental health into organizational programs by: Discussing substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions as they relate to other health programs or activities your organization conducts (e.g., the impact of substances on exercise and nutrition). Promoting resources for information and assistance (e.g., the Check Your Mood self-screener included in the toolkit). Including websites that address medication, alcohol, and mental health conditions in computer classes. Incorporating the issues into lifestyle programs (e.g., retirement or moving can put older adults at risk for depression or alcohol misuse). Addressing the issues as part of holiday programs, such as \"Coping With Holiday Stress.\" Addressing the issues in sessions on coping with stress, loss, or grief. Incorporating the issues in sessions on diseases such as osteoporosis (alcohol use can increase the risk of falls) and diabetes (drinking is unsafe). Providing self-screening tools at health fairs and other appropriate events and in annual surveys. Inviting speakers from Alcoholics Anonymous and other appropriate programs to present programs. Inviting recovery groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous or self-help groups to hold meetings at your facility. Increasing links with assessment and treatment organizations by establishing referral networks. Identifying and implementing evidence-based interventions that promote older adult wellness. Identifying materials to add to your organization's library, mount on a bulletin board, or place in a display case. Identifying local educational offerings appropriate for staff and clients. Identifying appropriate websites on which to place advertisements directed toward clients and staff. Informing older volunteers of resources to help their peers. Encouraging the faith community to offer information and training at their facilities.Program Coordinator's Guide15References 1. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. (2011).

INTRODUCTION\u201410 MINUTES Trainer Note: When introducing yourself, share something about yourself\u2014why you chose this work or a personal story related to the topic. The key is to establish rapport and give the group confidence in your abilities. Introduce yourself. Introduce the Get Connected Toolkit. If there is a speaker or resource person, introduce this person. Agenda Post agenda for session (above) on flip chart in front of room or review it aloud with the group.18 Get ConnectedExpectations for the Session Trainer Note: Suggested expectations are listed here. Feel free to add to this list or adapt it to your group. Solicit agreement from the group. Ask questions when something is unclear. One person speaks at a time. Respect differing opinions and experiences. Confidentiality\u2014what is said in the room, stays in the room. Start and end the session on time. If the leader of the group does not know an answer to a question, the leader will find the answer and follow up. Learning Objectives Trainer Note: Present the learning objectives below. Whenever possible, tie an objective to a recent news story, statistic/trend, or experience. Increase understanding that life transitions associated with aging can lead to problems with alcohol and medications. Learn the warning signs of an alcohol or medication problem and why these signs are hard to detect among older adults. Increase awareness that prevention and screening can help identify a need for help. OPENING EXERCISE\u201410 MINUTES Before you show the YouTube video, introduce key points: Alcohol and medications are part of our society. Alcohol is used in celebrations, religious rituals, and social situations. Prescription medicines and over-the counter drugs provide relief, healing, and health for many. Both alcohol and medications can affect physical health, emotional well-being, community involvement, and relationships with friends and family. Screening can help identify those who may need help. Many people may feel uncomfortable discussing these topics, so this presentation is designed to make it easier. Solicit quick answers to the question: \"Why do older adults drink alcohol?\" Have participants call out answers. YOUTUBE VIDEO PRESENTATION\u2014 30 MINUTES Trainer Note: After you introduce the YouTube video, turn off the lights. Make sure everyone can see and hear adequately. Introduce the YouTube video. Explain that this video was selected because it presents an overview of issues for older adults. The people portrayed in the video are real people with real problems. Alcohol and medication misuse cuts across all racial and ethnic lines, levels of education, income, and religions. It is a pervasive problem in our society. Show the YouTube video. Solicit brief comments or questions before you proceed with discussion. GROUP DISCUSSION\u201410 TO 40 MINUTES Trainer Note: Depending on the time allowed, discussion can take several directions. Choose from the following questions and possible responses to start the discussion. Try to elicit responses from the participants rather than just suggesting the items in the lists. The key is to increase sensitivity and comfort with the issues 19 Program Support Materialsand break down personal barriers or biases that can inhibit work on these issues. Above all, try to guide the discussion toward a view of the overall message of the YouTube video\u2014rather than focusing on the particular situation or circumstances of the individuals who appear in the presentation. Challenges 1. What are some of the challenges people face as they grow older?Possible responses: Retirement Loss of spouse, friends Isolation/Less social contact More health problems Loss of independence 2. How do people cope with these challenges in both positive and negative ways?Possible responses:The ability to remain involved with others is key to handling transitions and life changes in a healthy and productive way. Positive coping might include the following: Exercise Social clubs and networks Attending senior center activities V olunteer work Attending a religious ceremony or event Visiting with family and friends Negative coping skills might involve the following: Drinking Overmedicating Isolation Retreating from things once enjoyed Fear Illness Sleeping Withdrawing from social interactions Alcohol and Medications 1. Why might a person use or misuse alcohol and medicines? Possible responses: Grief, loss, sadness Loneliness Stress Chronic pain Illness Sleep problems Social pressure Celebration Reduce inhibitions 2.

What are some of the warning signs? Possible responses: Memory loss Dizziness Depression Neglect of self, home, hygiene Sleep problems Drinking more, and more often What You Can Do 1. What concerns and attitudes prevent us from stepping in to help someone we suspect of having a problem with alcohol? Possible responses: Prejudice and discrimination associated with alcoholism Fear of rejection Fear of losing a friend Denial of problem Lack of knowledge to recognize problem Cultural beliefs Privacy issues 2. What can we do to help? Possible responses: Acknowledge our feelings. Get help from a doctor or counselor. Be sensitive to protect self-confidence and self-esteem. Not ignore what we suspect might be a problem. Get support from family and friends. GROUP ACTIVITY\u201415 MINUTES Trainer Note: The purpose of this activity is to educate staff about the importance of screening. By conducting the self-screening with staff, you can show them how they can use the experience to educate older adults and conduct the screening more effectively. State that many of the people in the YouTube video did not realize that medications or alcohol was a problem for them until they had grown dependent. By that time, it was difficult for them to acknowledge the problem and seek help. Screening can help people recognize a possible problem, allowing them to get help and prevent further health problems. Introduce activity: Pass a copy of \"10 Important Questions for Those Over 65\" to each participant. Make sure each person has a pen or pencil. Explain that the self-screener helps each of us to evaluate our own situation and does not provide a definitive diagnosis.21 Program Support Materials Emphasize that all results are confidential. Read each question and have participants mark answers on the self-screener. Explain how to self-score. Recommend that any participants with concerns about themselves or a loved one speak to a physician, health or mental health specialist, or alcohol counselor. Offer to be available after the session to address any questions. If time permits, ask: 1. Do you know anyone who might benefit from this screening? 2. How might you approach someone to offer this screening? 3. What problems might you encounter? QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\u201410 MINUTESCLOSING\u20145 MINUTES Summarize key points: Life changes and transitions can be difficult for older adults, and strong coping skills are needed. Loss, grief, and new roles can lead to problems with alcohol and medications. Get help. If you think something is wrong, it probably is. Ignoring a problem will not make it go away, and it may make the problem worse. Thank participants for coming and participating and for their willingness to talk about what can be a difficult topic. FEEDBACK Pass out the feedback form (a sample form appears in the Forms and Resources section) and stay around for individual questions after the session. Be ready with additional resources included in the Get Connected Toolkit, and have available local and internet resources.22 Get ConnectedStaff Education Session 2: Using Medications Wisely AGENDA Introduction 10 minutes Opening Exercise 20 minutes Presentation 45 to 75 minutes Questions and Answers 10 minutes Closing and Feedback 5 minutes 1.5 to 2 hours total MATERIALS NEEDED Fact Sheets #4: An Invisible Problem: Alcohol and Older Adults #6: Prescription and Over-the-Counter Medications and Older Adults Brochure \"As You Age...A Guide to Aging, Medicines, and Alcohol\" available at http://store.samhsa.gov/product/As-You-Age-A-Guide-to-Aging-Medicines-and-Alcohol/SMA04-3940 Props Empty wine bottle/glass, shot glass, beer can, prescription bottle, or bottles of over-the-counter medicines such as Tylenol, NyQuil, cough syrup, or Benadryl Measuring cup Magnifying glass National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's (NIAAA) recommended drinking limits Flip chart with markersPREPARATION Review all related materials before the session.

INTRODUCTION\u201410 MINUTES Trainer Note: When introducing yourself, share something about yourself to establish rapport with the group. Post the phone number of the staff or resource person, or pass out business cards. This topic is important because: One in five older adults has problems with alcohol and/or medications. This means we all probably know someone with problems, whether or not we know that person is suffering. Alcohol and medication misuse/abuse in aging constitutes a silent epidemic\u2014 underdiagnosed and undertreated. This is a health problem that can be prevented and treated. The Get Connected Toolkit addresses alcohol and medication misuse in aging services organizations around the country. Agenda Post agenda for session (above) on flip chart in front of room or review it aloud with group.23 Program Support MaterialsExpectations of the Session Trainer Note: Suggested expectations are listed here.

Trainer Note: You can choose one of the following exercises, depending on time, comfort level, what you want to emphasize, and the group.1. Pose the question: What is a drinking problem? Solicit responses. Ask: How much alcohol is a drinking problem? How many drinks of hard liquor? Wine? Beer? How does it differ for an older adult who: -Has diabetes? -Is taking sleeping pills or a painkiller? -Is just taking Tylenol for headaches? Summarize responses on a flip chart. 2. Pass around wine bottle and beer can and ask the group to read the labels. Ask: What percentage of alcohol is in the wine and the beer? Solicit responses from group. 3. Have water in the wine bottle and ask a volunteer to pour \"a glass of wine\" into an empty wine glass. Ask the group if this is the right amount for a serving of wine. Pour the amount into the measuring cup so everyone can see. Compare it with the recommended 5 ounces for one glass of wine. Pass around several prescription and over- the-counter bottles and the magnifying glass and ask the group to read the labels. Observe what the group does. Ask: Which medicines should not be taken with alcohol? What other warnings did you see? Expired? Causes drowsiness?24 Get Connected Were the directions clear? Can you read them? What does \"take as needed\" mean? What does \"take on an empty stomach\" mean? Present NIAAA's recommended limits for a standard drink, recommended drinking limits for people over 65, and guidelines on who should never drink (\"Recommended Sensible Drinking Limits\"). Emphasize it is not how much or how often an older adult drinks that defines a drinking problem. PRESENTATION\u201445 TO 75 MINUTES Trainer Note: Several options are available for this presentation. Coordinator can present material, invite a speaker to present, or arrange for a panel of experts. Use Fact Sheets #4 and #6 for content information.

If using a resource person or panel of speakers, introduce them. Key Points To Cover in the PresentationA physician, health or mental health specialist, or alcohol counselor can speak about: Why people drink or misuse medication; What puts older adults at risk of developing a problem with medication or alcohol; Why healthy older adults who do not take medications should drink no more than three alcoholic drinks a day, or a maximum of seven drinks per week\u2014and why women are advised to drink less; Signs and symptoms of alcohol misuse; and Barriers to recognizing a problem in older adults. A pharmacist can speak about: Drug interactions and interactions with alcohol; Side effects of medications; Risk factors for medication misuse; Risk factors specific to older adults; Warning signs of medication misuse; and Ways to avoid misuse. An older adult in recovery or a family member of someone who misuses substances such as alcohol and medication can speak about: How the problem went from use to misuse; Impact of misuse on the individual, family, friends, and community; and How he/she got help. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\u201410 MINUTES CLOSING\u20145 MINUTES Summarize key points: This is a largely unrecognized problem among older adults. Review reasons problems go unrecognized and untreated.

Expectations for the SessionTrainer Note: Suggested expectations are listed here. Feel free to add to this list or adapt it to your group. Solicit agreement from the group. Ask questions when something is unclear. One person speaks at a time. Respect differing opinions and experiences. Confidentiality\u2014what is said in the room, stays in the room.26 Get Connected Start and end the session on time. If the leader of group does not know an answer to a question, the leader will find the answer and follow up. Learning Objectives Trainer Note: Present the learning objectives below. Whenever possible, tie an objective to a recent news story, statistic/trend, or experience. Increase awareness that substance misuse and abuse and mental health conditions in older adults are not part of the aging process and can be treated. Increase awareness that prevention and treatment are effective for alcohol and mental health conditions, particularly for older adults. Increase comfort and confidence in discussing sensitive issues with older adults. Understand what health and aging services providers can do to help older adults. OPENING EXERCISE\u201410 MINUTES Using Fact Sheet #1, Myths and Realities of Alcohol, Medications, and Mental Health Conditions in Older Adults, state one myth at a time. (The last five myths focus on mental health conditions.) Read the myths as facts. Have participants discuss their feelings about the statements or share an experience with a statement. Read the \"Reality\" piece after each myth before you move to the next statement. Summarize: Acknowledge the range of responses you heard. Discuss how pervasive misconceptions in society can hurt older adults and how this session can start to dispel some of these myths.This topic is important because: Untreated alcohol, medication, and mental health conditions can significantly reduce the quality of life for older adults and cause serious health problems. Prevention and treatment are effective, particularly among older adults. Recognizing problems and overcoming discomfort in talking about difficult issues can improve health and quality of life. Many of these problems can be prevented with education and information. There is a need to decrease the prejudice and discrimination and isolation that results from mental health conditions. Older adults have a need for more mental health services that are accessible and affordable. The Get Connected Toolkit increases awareness of mental health conditions in older adults as a first step to addressing these problems. PRESENTATION\u201440 MINUTES Trainer Note: If you have chosen a speaker for this session, introduce him or her. A social worker or alcohol counselor would be a good choice for this session. A health educator or trainer familiar with the topic would also be appropriate. Use Fact Sheets #7 and #8, as well as the brochure, \"Good Mental Health Is Ageless\" (available from the SAMHSA store at http://store.samhsa.gov/product/Good-Mental- Health-is-Ageless/SMA15-3618), for content information. 27 Program Support MaterialsKey points in the presentation: Common mental health conditions in older adults include: -Anxiety -Cognitive impairment -Depression Recognizing symptoms of mental health conditions: -Solicit examples from the group and supplement information. Challenges to recognizing symptoms. Impact of mental health conditions in older adults. Use an example that fits older adults to illustrate the impact, such as Bingo, book clubs, or other social activities. When older adults suffer from depression, they may not want to attend [insert social activity, e.g., Bingo, book club]. When older adults suffer from cognitive impairment, they may forget [insert skill or piece of information, e.g., how to play Bingo, the plot of the book they are reading]. When older adults suffer from sensory impairment, they may not hear [insert example, e.g., the Bingo numbers] or see [insert example, e.g., the numbers on their Bingo card]. Summarize: We know mental health conditions are prevalent in older adults. We know prevention and treatment are effective. What is the \"disconnect\"? Solicit responses from the group. Possible responses: Prejudice and discrimination Denial Discrimination Uninformed health care providers Symptoms hard to recognize Lack of access to needed services. GROUP ACTIVITY\u201420 TO 50 MINUTES Trainer Note: The purpose of this activity is to educate staff about the importance of screening. By conducting the self-screening with staff, you can help them use the experience to educate older adults and conduct the screening more effectively. Pass a copy of the screening tool \"Check Your Mood\" to each participant. Explain that this self-screener provides a useful way for older adults to review their health and raise awareness of potential problems. The self-screener does not give a diagnosis. The information may motivate an individual to seek help. Emphasize that all results are confidential and will not be viewed by anyone else. Read each question aloud and ask participants to fill out their own self-screeners in private. Explain how to self-score. Emphasize that if the self-screener detects a problem, the individual should speak with a doctor or another health care professional. Discuss the experience and what they learned by doing the self-screener. Ask: 1. Do you know anyone who may benefit from this screening tool? 2. How might you approach someone to offer screening?28 Get ConnectedSolicit opening lines from the group, such as: I am concerned about... Would you be interested in learning more about...? You used to love to...and now... Role Play Ask for two volunteers to role-play a scenario of a health and aging services provider approaching an older adult to ask if he or she would be interested in the screening tool for depression. Get feedback from the rest of the group. If time permits, this is a good time to discuss the role of the health and aging services provider in providing education, screening, and referral to providers of mental health services. Discuss the protocol for how screening and referral will work in your organization. Discuss roles and responsibilities. Discuss what is NOT the role of the health and aging services provider (e.g., do not judge, diagnose, assume, treat, break confidentiality). Present resources and referrals in place once an older adult is identified. Review follow-up procedures. Discuss confidentiality issues, policies, and procedures. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\u20145 MINUTES CLOSING\u20145 MINUTES Summarize key points: Up to 5 percent of older adults meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, and 3-14 percent meet the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. 1,2 Education and screening can help identify those who may need help from a doctor. Treatments are effective and can improve quality of life. Approaching an older person with a suspected problem is a skill that can be learned. The Get Connected Toolkit recommends encouraging all older adults to take self-screeners for alcohol use and depression. Confidentiality issues must be recognized for successful screening to take place. Thank the speaker. Thank participants for their time and willingness to embark on this program. Acknowledge the hard work of staff and the important impact they have on the lives of older adults. Encourage participants to think about these issues, review materials, and notify you if they are concerned about an older adult.

If the leader of the group does not know an answer to a question, the leader will find the answer and follow up. Learning Objectives Trainer Note: Present the learning objectives below. Whenever possible, tie an objective to a recent news story, statistic/trend, or experience. Increase understanding that life transitions associated with aging can lead to problems with alcohol and medications. Learn the warning signs of an alcohol or medication problem and why these signs are hard to detect among older adults. Increase awareness that prevention and screening can help to identify a need for help. OPENING EXERCISE\u20145 MINUTES Before you show the YouTube video, introduce the following key points: Alcohol and medications are part of our society. Alcohol is used in celebrations, religious rituals, and social situations. Prescription medicines and over-the counter drugs provide relief, healing, and health for many people. Both alcohol and medications can affect physical health, emotional well-being, community involvement, and relationships with friends and family. Screening can help identify those who may need help. Many people may feel uncomfortable discussing these topics, so this presentation is designed to make it easier. Solicit quick answers to the question: \"Why do older adults drink alcohol?\" Have participants call out answers. YOUTUBE VIDEO PRESENTATION\u201425 MINUTES Trainer Note: After you introduce the YouTube video, turn off the lights. Make sure everyone can see and hear adequately. Introduce the YouTube video. Explain that this video was selected because it presents an overview of issues for older adults. The people portrayed in the video are real people with real problems. Alcohol and medication misuse cuts across all racial and ethnic lines, levels of education, income, and religions. It is a pervasive problem in our society. Show the YouTube video. Solicit brief comments or questions before you proceed with discussion. GROUP ACTIVITY\u201415 MINUTES Trainer Note: The purpose of this activity is to educate older adults about possible alcohol problems. Emphasize that the activity is voluntary and all results are confidential. If help is available in the room, offer it to those who may have trouble seeing or reading. State that many of the people in the YouTube video did not realize that medications or alcohol was a problem for them until they had grown dependent. By that time, it was difficult for them to acknowledge the problem and seek help.31 Program Support MaterialsScreening can help people recognize a possible problem, allowing them to get help and prevent further health problems. Introduce the activity: Pass a copy of \"10 Important Questions for Those Over 65\" to each participant. Make sure each person has a pen or pencil. Explain that the self-screener helps each of us to evaluate our own situation and does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Emphasize that all results are confidential and will not be viewed by anyone else. Read each question and have participants mark answers on the self-screener. Explain how to self-score. Recommend that any participants who have concerns about themselves or a loved one speak to a physician, health or mental health specialist or alcohol counselor. Offer to be available after the session to address any questions. If time permits, ask: 1. Do you know anyone who may benefit from this screening? 2. How might you approach someone to offer this screening?QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\u20145 MINUTES Trainer Note: Be prepared for personal questions and questions such as where to get help for a friend in need. Have a list or be aware of local resources available to assist someone in need. A resource person might be able to answer these questions and provide referrals, if necessary. CLOSING\u20145 MINUTES Summarize the following key points: Life changes and transitions can be difficult for older adults, and strong coping skills are needed. Loss, grief, and new roles can lead to problems with alcohol and medications. Get help. If you think something is wrong, it probably is. Ignoring a problem will not make it go away, and it may make the problem worse. Screening is one way to identify people in need of help. Thank participants for coming and participating and for their willingness to talk about what can be a difficult topic.

Whenever possible, tie an objective to a recent news story, statistic/trend, or personal experience. Increase awareness that mental health conditions in older adults are not part of the aging process and can be treated. Increase awareness that prevention and treatment are effective for alcohol and mental health conditions, particularly for older adults. Increase comfort and confidence in discussing sensitive issues with health care providers when problems arise. OPENING EXERCISE\u201410 MINUTES Using Fact Sheet #1, Myths and Realities of Alcohol, Medications, and Mental Health Conditions in Older Adults, state one myth at a time. (The last five myths focus on mental health conditions.) Read the myths as facts. Have participants discuss their feelings about the statements or share an experience with the statement. Read the \"Reality\" piece after each myth before you move to the next statement. Summarize: Acknowledge the range of responses you heard. Discuss how pervasive misconceptions in society can hurt older adults and how this session can start to dispel some of these myths. This topic is important because: Untreated alcohol, medication, and mental health conditions can significantly reduce quality of life for older adults and cause serious health problems. Treatment is effective, particularly among older adults. Recognizing problems and overcoming discomfort in talking about difficult issues can improve health and quality of life. Many of these problems can be prevented with education and information. There is a need to decrease the discrimination and isolation that result from mental health conditions. There is a need for more mental health services that are accessible and affordable for older adults. The Get Connected Toolkit increases awareness of mental health conditions in older adults as a first step to addressing these problems. PRESENTATION\u201420 MINUTES Trainer Note: If you have chosen a speaker for this session, introduce him or her. A social worker or an alcohol counselor would be a good choice for this session.

Cover the following key points in the presentation: Common mental health conditions in older adults include: -Anxiety -Cognitive impairment -Depression Recognizing symptoms of mental health conditions. -Challenges to recognizing symptoms. Impact of mental health conditions in older adults.38 Get ConnectedUse an example that fits older adults to illustrate the impact, such as Bingo, book clubs, or other social activities. When older adults suffer from depression, they may not want to attend [insert social activity, e.g., Bingo, book club]. When older adults suffer from cognitive impairment, they may forget [insert skill or piece of information, e.g., how to play Bingo, the plot of the book they are reading]. When older adults suffer from sensory impairment, they may not hear [insert example, e.g., the Bingo numbers] or see [insert example, e.g., the numbers on their Bingo card]. Summarize: We know mental health conditions are prevalent in older adults. We know prevention and treatment are effective. What is the \"disconnect\"? Solicit responses from the group. Possible responses: Prejudice and discrimination Denial Discrimination Uninformed health care providers Symptoms hard to recognize Limited access to health care GROUP ACTIVITY\u201415 MINUTES Trainer Note: The purpose of this activity is to educate older adults about possible alcohol problems in themselves and those they love. Pass a copy of the self-screening tool \"Check Your Mood\" to each participant. Explain that this self-screener provides a useful way for older adults to review their health and raise awareness of potential problems. The self-screener does not give a diagnosis. The information may motivate an individual to seek help. Emphasize that all results are confidential. Read each question aloud and ask participants to fill out their own self-screeners in private. Explain how to self-score. Emphasize that if the self-screener detects a problem, the individual should speak with a doctor or health care professional. Discuss the experience and what they learned by doing the self-screener. Ask: 1. Do you know anyone who might benefit from this screening tool? 2. How might you approach someone to offer screening? QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\u20145 MINUTES Trainer Note: Be prepared for personal questions and questions such as where to get help for a friend in need. A resource person might be able to answer these questions and provide referrals, if necessary. CLOSING\u20145 MINUTES Summarize key points: Up to 5 percent of older adults meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, and 3-14 percent meet the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. 1,2 Education and screening can help identify those who may need help from a physician, 39 Program Support Materialshealth or mental health specialist, or alcohol counselor. Treatments are effective and can improve quality of life. Approaching an older person with a suspected problem is a skill that can be learned. The Get Connected Toolkit recommends encouraging all older adults to take self-screeners for alcohol use and depression. Confidentiality issues must be recognized for successful screening to take place. Thank the speaker. Thank participants for coming and participating and for their willingness to talk about what can be a difficult topic. Thank them for their time and willingness to embark on this program. Encourage participants to think about these issues, review materials, and notify you if they have concerns.FEEDBACK Pass out forms (a sample appears in the Forms and Resources section). Pass out handouts. Stay around for any personal questions an older adult might want to ask after the session. Be ready with local resources if someone asks for them. References 1. Hybels, C.

Lack of correct information can prevent older adults from seeking and receiving help for these issues. Learning what is reality and what is a myth can help improve the quality of life for you or someone you care about. MYTH Only older adults who consistently drink a lot of alcohol have an alcohol problem. REALITY The key point in determining a problem is how the alcohol affects the person' s health, functioning, and relationships with others. For example, in people with medical conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, even one drink per day can be a problem. MYTH Over-the-counter medicines and alcohol can be used together safely. REALITY It is never safe to drink alcohol while taking medicine. Both prescription and over -the- counter medicines can intensify the effects of alcohol. This can be dangerous or even fatal. In addition, using medicines and alcohol together, even several hours apart, can change a drug's effects. For example, the drug might not work.42 Get ConnectedMYTH If alcohol and medication misuse were a problem, the doctor would tell the older adult. REALITY Unfortunately, many doctors and other health care professionals do not ask questions about the use of alcohol with medications. Therefore, older adults are at risk for harmful interactions of alcohol with medications. It is important for them to let their doctor know what drugs they are taking and how they use alcohol. MYTH It's easy to tell when an older adult has an alcohol problem. REALITY The symptoms of alcohol misuse are sometimes mistaken for signs of aging or physical illness. Alcohol misuse can mimic or intensify the signs and symptoms of many illnesses. In addition, medical problems can mask alcohol dependence. MYTH Very few women become alcoholics. REALITY Many women have problems with alcohol. Women may not drink publicly; they may remain private about their alcohol use. Thus, people often don't know they have problems. MYTH Treating substance misuse and abuse issues in older adults is a waste of time and effort. It's too late for them to change. REALITY Substance misuse and abuse interventions and mental health treatments are effective with older adults. They can greatly improve quality of life.43 Program Support MaterialsMYTH Feeling sad or depressed is part of growing old. There' s nothing you can do to help the older adult. REALITY Depression is common among older adults, but it isn' t a normal part of aging. Believing that depression is inevitable prevents older people from seeking and getting the help they need. MYTH Older adults suffering from depression or anxiety disorders lack inner strength to fight the debilitating feelings. REALITY Depression and anxiety disorders have many possible causes. Lack of inner strength is not one of them. Causes of depression and anxiety include heredity , stressful events such as the death of a loved one, retirement, health problems, and reactions to medicine. Drug interactions and alcohol and drug combinations can also lead to depression and anxiety . MYTH The most common sign of depression is crying. REALITY Denial of mental health conditions is often more common and more predictable than any other symptom. The last person to recognize a problem is often the person with the problem. Because of the strong negative prejudice and discrimination association with mental health conditions, many older adults are afraid to seek help. Other signs of depression include being easily upset and feeling fearful, for getful, confused, hopeless, lonely , and tired. Loss of appetite is also common.44 Get ConnectedMYTH If an older adult says that drinking is his or her last remaining pleasure, it is generally best to allow the person to continue to drink. Even if it causes him or her problems, it doesn' t matter as long as others are not being put at risk. REALITY Problem drinking seriously affects physical health and quality of life. It can lead to loneliness, isolation, and depression. It can also lead to for getfulness, and it may reduce problem-solving skills. Sometimes others unknowingly encourage drinking if they think older people have only a limited time left and therefore should be allowed to enjoy themselves.

This isn't always true. Age-related changes make older adults more sensitive to the effects of alcohol. In addition, older adults are more likely to be taking at least one medication for a chronic illness. Alcohol can interact with medical conditions or medication and cause problems. Sensible Drinking Limits As people age, their sensitivity to alcohol increases. Older adults may become intoxicated more easily . Therefore, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends that adults 65 and older who are healthy and do not take medications drink no more than three alcoholic drinks a day or a maximum of seven drinks per week. Women are advised to drink less than this because their bodies react differently to alcohol than men' s do. One alcoholic drink is: 12 ounces of beer; 5 ounces of wine; or 1.5 ounces of liquor (80 proof). Do not drink alcohol if you: Plan to drive; Perform activities requiring attention, such as minding grandchildren or usingpower tools; Take certain prescription or over -the-counter drugs (ask your doctor or health care provider);46 Get Connected Have certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes; or Are in recovery from alcohol problems. Benefits and Risks of Alcohol Use Research suggests there may be both benefits and risks to moderate drinking (up to two drinks per day for men and up to one drink per day for women). The benefits include reducing stress and tension, improving mood, reducing the risk of heart attacks, reducing inhibitions and shyness, and improving one's ability to interact with others. However, these benefits can be achieved instead through diet and exercise. It is important to understand the risks as well as potential benefits so that you can make a good decision about alcohol use. If you don't drink, don't start. Alcohol can increase the risk of stroke, cause confusion, and slow the time it takes to react to a dangerous situation while driving. Alcohol can also interact harmfully with hundreds of medications. Alcohol causes some drugs to be more potent than intended and other drugs to be less effective. Certain medical problems can get worse or go unrecognized. Finally , alcohol can be addictive. Family problems and violence can result. The Decision To Use Alcohol There are tradeoffs involved in any decision about drinking. The risks may offset the health benefits. Little research has been done on the effects of alcohol on older adults. Any beneficial effects of alcohol probably can be achieved with alternatives, such as: Changing one's diet; Beginning a simple exercise program; or Quitting smoking. Questions To Ask Your Doctor or Pharmacist About Your Medication What is the name of the drug I have been prescribed? Is a generic equivalentavailable? Why am I taking it? Do I really need it? What are the side effects? Which of these should I report right away?47 Program Support Materials How often should I take the medication? How much do I take? When should I take the drug? What should I do if I miss a dose? Should I take it with food or on an empty stomach? Are there any special precautions I should be aware of? Are there foods to avoid? Can I drink alcohol with this medication? Can I drive while taking this drug? When can I stop taking this drug? Will this drug interact with any other prescription or over-the-counter drugs I amtaking? Medication Do's DO understand all instructions before you take a medication. DO follow instructions exactly. If you miss a dose, do not take two doses next timewithout calling your doctor. DO keep all medications in one place. DO keep medications taken by mouth separate from those you put on skin. DO check the expiration dates on all prescription and over-the-counter drugs. DO organize a system for taking medications, such as a chart or a plastic pillcontainer. Medication Don'ts DON'T drink alcohol in combination with other drugs without first asking a doctoror pharmacist. DON'T give, take, or trade medications with another person. DON'T transfer a drug from its original container to another, except for pillcontainers. DON'T save medications for future use. DON'T take medications in the dark. DON'T stop taking medications without first checking with a doctor. DON'T break pills without first checking with a doctor or pharmacist.48 Get ConnectedGeneral Heal th Tips Eat well and exercise regularly . Stay in touch with friends and relatives. Participate in interesting activities. Get plenty of rest, but don' t use alcohol to help you sleep. Try warm milk, or talk to your doctor or other health care professional about other options.

Sometimes it' s hard to tell a problem e xists. People may mistake alcohol and drug problems for a bad mood, dementia, or Alzheimer' s disease. But knowing what to look for can help . Symptoms of alcohol or medication problems in older adults include the following: Blackouts Forgetfulness or trouble concentrating Frequent falls and unexplained bruising Shakes or tremors Constant irritability and altered mood Depression or anxiety Poor hygiene and self-neglect Sleep problems or daytime drowsiness Slurred speech Clumsiness and trouble walking Alcohol and drugs can interact with each other to cause these symptoms. Also, drugs can interact with each other . Thus, it is crucial to make sure older adults take their medications properly . Prevention Framework The Institute of Medicine suggests a prevention framework based on levels of risk: Universal programs, such as seminars and posters in senior centers. These target general groups, regardless of risk. For older people, the goal is to prevent inappropriate use of alcohol and medications. An example would be posting 50 Get Connectedthe recommended drinking limit. This is no more than three drinks per day or a maximum of seven drinks per week. People with certain conditions, such as diabetes, are advised not to drink alcohol. In addition, women are advised to drink less than this because their bodies react differently to alcohol than men' s do. Selective programs, such as screening and brief interventions. These target people with above average risk for substance misuse and abuse. Individuals are tar geted based on risk factors. In older people, these include grief over the death of a spouse, retirement, and health problems. Indicated programs, such as elder-specific treatment programs. These target people engaged in high-risk behaviors. The goal is to prevent chronic use and severe problems. Based on this framework, several prevention strategies are available. Prevention Strategies Information dissemination. This is designed to increase knowledge and change attitudes about substance use. Programs include health promotion seminars and media campaigns. For example, a discussion at a senior center could focus on aging and alcohol. Prevention education. This teaches participants important skills. These include coping with life changes, using medicines properly, and using alcohol appropriately. Programs include bereavement support groups, retirement programs, and wellness programs. Efforts can also include providing tools such as medication tracking charts. Alternative activities. These replace, reduce, or stop substance use. Many older adults drink socially for companionship and something to do. Alternatives include Foster Grandparents, arts programs, and book clubs. Problem identification. This helps refer individuals with substance use disorders for assessment and treatment. Service providers can help by encouraging the use of screening tools. A popular tool for older people is the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test\u2014Geriatric Version (See Screening Tool #1). It is easy for older adults to use and score.51 Program Support MaterialsCommunity-based pr ocesses. These expand community resources for preventing substance misuse and abuse in older adults. An example is a prevention partnership. Partnerships may include: Caregivers Educators Community leaders Health care providers Family members Neighbors Roommates Friends Pharmacists Senior center staff Spiritual leaders Envir onmental appr oaches. These promote policy changes to decrease risk and prevent substance misuse and abuse. An example would be alcohol-free parties at senior centers. Aspects of Promising Prevention Programs for Older Adul ts It is important to tailor prevention programs to older adults. Prevention efforts for older people include: Outreach at senior centers, residential facilities, and other community settings Interdisciplinary approaches among medical, legal, financial, and social service professionals Age-appropriate materials Family and caregiver involvement A philosophy that encourages older people to seek and accept help Growth opportunities Commitment to healthy aging Culturally sensitive approaches52 Get ConnectedFor mor e infor mation, visit the SAMHSA Stor e at www v, contact SAMHSA at 1-877-SAMHSA-7 (1-877-726-4727) (English and Espa\u00f1ol), visit the SAMHSA website at www .samhsa.go v.The number of prevention programs aimed at older adults is growing. Examples of prevention programs follow . Healthy IDEAS (Identifying Depr ession, Empowering Activities for Seniors)\u2014 This is a community depression program designed to detect and reduce the severity of depressive symptoms in older adults with chronic health conditions and functional limitations. The program incorporates four evidence-based components into the ongoing service delivery of care/case management or social service programs serving older individuals in the home environment over several months. For more information, visit www .ncoa.or g/improve-health/center -for-healthy- aging/content-library/Healthy-Ideas.pdf. Wellness Initiative for Senior Education (WISE)\u2014This is a curriculum-based health promotion program that aims to help older adults increase their knowledge and awareness of issues related to health and the aging process. Based on the health belief model of behavioral change, WISE provides older adults with the information and resources they need to maintain a healthy lifestyle and become empowered in regard to both their health and the health care they receive. The six-lesson WISE curriculum is delivered by trained substance misuse and abuse prevention specialists at small-group sessions held weekly over a six-week period. Each lesson lasts two to three hours and normally includes breakfast or lunch.

But one thing we don't often think of is alcohol problems. Right now, it is estimated that more than 2 million older people in the United States have some sort of alcohol problem. 1 An alcohol problem is defined as drinking above the limits recommended by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, using alcohol while taking prescription drugs, or using alcohol in any other way that is harmful. It is crucial to address alcohol problems among older people, because these problems can be harmful and even fatal. An Invisible Problem Even as the number of older adults with alcohol problems climbs, the problem remains unrecognized and untreated. Until recently, alcohol misuse was not discussed in either substance misuse and abuse or gerontological literature. For various reasons, such as lack of training and hurried doctor visits, health care providers often overlook alcohol problems among older adults. Such problems can be hard to diagnose because symptoms may mimic other disorders often linked with older people. These include diabetes, dementia, and depression. Many older adults disapprove of and feel shame about alcohol abuse. Many do not want to seek professional help for what they consider a private matter. Many relatives of older people with alcohol problems, particularly their adult children, are also ashamed of the problem and choose not to address it. Ageism further contributes to this problem and to the silence. Younger adults often unconsciously assign different quality-of-life standards to older adults. Many will 54 Get Connecteddismiss problems with remarks such as, \"Grandmother's sherry is the only thing that makes her happy.\" In addition, some people think that helping older adults with alcohol problems is a waste of resources. The serious effects of alcohol make it essential to identify, prevent, and treat problems among older adults. Preventing the harmful effects of alcohol misuse and abuse can give an older person a longer, more productive, and healthier life. Risk Factors for Alcohol Problems Risk factors make people more vulnerable to alcohol problems. As individuals age, many experience losses, including: Death of spouse, friends, and other family members Loss of job\u2014and related income, social status, and self-esteem\u2014as a result of retirement Loss of mobility (trouble using public transportation, inability to drive, problems walking) Impaired vision and hearing, insomnia, and memory problems Declining health because of chronic illnesses Separation from children and loss of home as a result of relocation Loss of social support and interesting activities Older adults who are trying to cope with these losses may use or abuse alcohol. Protective Factors Protective factors increase resistance to alcohol misuse by promoting healthy behavior. They also offset risk factors. Protective factors for older adults include: Access to resources, such as housing and health care Availability of support networks and social bonds Involvement in community activities Supportive family relationships Education (e.g., wise use of medications) and skills55 Program Support Materials Sense of purpose and identity Ability to live independently Signs and S ymptoms Changes in behavior , drinking patterns, or physical condition may indicate a drinking problem. One symptom might not be meaningful, but if several occur , a problem might exist. It is important to check for various signs and symptoms of alcohol problems, such as: Making excuses, hiding or denying drinking, getting annoyed when asked about drinking; Blackouts or seizures; Bladder and bowel incontinence, urinary retention, difficulty urinating; Dry mouth, dehydration, malnutrition, muscle wasting, anorexia, changes in eating habits; Memory problems, confusion or disorientation, blurred vision, slurred speech; Drinking in spite of medical warnings against it; Arrests for drinking and driving, frequent car accidents; Frequent falls, unexplained bruising, tremor , lack of coordination, problems walking; Increased tolerance to alcohol or withdrawal symptoms when alcohol is removed; Morning drinking; Neglect of home, bills, pets, personal hygiene, or self; Persistent irritability and altered mood, depression, or anxiety; Problems with family and friends, withdrawal from social activities, sexual problems; Sleep problems, unusual fatigue, malaise, or daytime drowsiness; Suicidal thoughts or suicide attempt; Unusual restlessness and agitation, aggressive or abusive behavior; and Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, bloating, and indigestion. If these signs or symptoms are present, it is advisable to consult a physician.56 Get ConnectedEffects of Alcohol Misuse Alcohol can trigger health problems in older adults or make them worse, including: Increased risk of high blood pressure and heart disease Increased risk of stroke Impaired immune system and ability to fight infection Cirrhosis and other liver diseases Decreased bone density and chronic pain Internal bleeding and ulcers Depression, anxiety , amnesia, and other mental health conditions Cancer of the stomach, larynx, pancreas, liver , or esophagus In addition, alcohol abuse may further elevate older adults' risk for injury , illness, and financial decline. It can also lead to family dysfunction, legal problems, and social problems. The toll on society is also great, with more injuries and illnesses and higher health costs.

Prevention and EducationBrief AdviceBrief InterventionPretreatment InterventionFormal Specialized Treatment Abstinence Problem Use Abuse/ Dependence58 Get ConnectedPrevention and Education About Older Adults' Problems With Alcohol Prevention and education encourage healthy lifestyles and successful strategies to cope with life challenges as one ages. Programs aim to reduce the likelihood of using alcohol to cope with stress. Examples include bereavement programs, retirement programs, and wellness programs. Various organizations offer health and wellness programs for older adults. It is important to be familiar with prevention programs, activities, and organizations that can help prevent alcohol abuse in older adults. These include senior centers, community centers, and adult day care centers. Keep an updated referral list containing contacts and phone numbers in your area. Get information on services offered, cost, schedule, and accessibility . Also, when possible, make prevention information, such as brochures, available in your office or center . Leisure clubs, health fairs, doctors' offices, congregate meal sites, Meals-On-Wheels, and senior day service programs also provide venues for prevention activities. Older adults can be encouraged to identify problems through the use of self-screeners distributed at seminars or lectures, doctors' offices, drug stores, and senior centers. Brief Advice Brief advice can be used with people who do not yet have alcohol problems but may be at risk. It may include inviting a person who has recently increased drinking to cut down. Brief advice can also include education about the effects of excess alcohol use. Brief advice is usually given by a clinician as part of a health checkup. Brief Intervention Brief interventions may be used to prevent or treat a problem. They can be used with any older adult who uses alcohol, regardless of the individual's risk level. A brief intervention involves one or more sessions. The sessions may include: Strategies to motivate change Education on medication and alcohol use or symptoms of depression Assessment and direct feedback Contracting and goal-setting to change behavior59 Program Support Materials Behavioral modification techniques Use of written materials such as self-help manuals and journals The goal is to motivate the problem drinker to change behavior. Many older at-risk and problem drinkers are ashamed about their drinking. Therefore, it is important to be non-confrontational and supportive. Pretreatment Intervention If a person is in denial, a pretreatment intervention can help the person recognize the impact of alcohol use on his or her family and friends. A pretreatment intervention (or \"intervention\") is a carefully planned meeting with the older person at which a few people talk about their concerns. These are usually close family members, health or social service providers, caregivers, and an addictions expert or other skilled counselor. It is advisable to include no more than three people because some older people may be overwhelmed by too much information from too many people. Before the intervention, the addictions expert, counselor, or health or service provider and the family or friends meet to plan the intervention. Participants are coached about offering information in an emotionally neutral, factual manner while maintaining a supportive, non-accusatory tone. The key is to present clear evidence that a problem exists. Formal Specialized Treatment In some cases, when a person has problems with alcohol dependence, formal treatment may be needed. The sooner treatment starts, the faster life can begin to get better. Once older people commit to stop drinking, they are more likely than younger adults to stay sober. Settings for treatment include outpatient services, residential rehabilitation, inpatient rehabilitation, and inpatient/outpatient detoxification treatment. In recent years, cost constraints have limited inpatient treatment. Most group treatment programs integrate older people with other adults. A few specialized older adult treatment programs focus solely on older adults. When possible, elder-specific treatment options should be explored.60 Get ConnectedTypes of Treatment Many forms of treatment exist. Depending on the desired outcome, different approaches may be used. Types of treatment include: Cognitive-behavioral approaches that teach people to recognize their motives for drinking and change their behavior Group-based approaches, which can help patients learn skills for coping with many of the life changes that can put one at risk for alcohol misuse, such as bereavement Individual counseling, which can help people deal with interpersonal conflicts and the underlying feelings of shame, denial, guilt, or anger Medical/psychiatric approaches that combine medication, such as Antabuse, with counseling Marital and family therapy, which can enhance treatment by focusing on rebuilding the social support network Effective discharge planning is essential for older clients. Their social networks may have shrunk as a result of their alcohol problems, physical limitations, or loss of family members and friends. Therefore, it is crucial for clients' counselors or case managers to help them tap into available community resources. Aftercare may entail arranging transportation to follow-up appointments and providing reminders of these appointments with dates and times on the calendar and phone calls. It also may involve more traditional functions, such as a clinician monitoring the older person's progress to prevent or minimize relapse. Some treatment programs have begun networking for ongoing support of clients by publicizing their services to other local agencies, such as Area Agencies on Aging, and health care facilities. Prior consultation with the local Office on Aging and other groups that target older adults helps to ensure that the resulting network responds to their special needs. Self-help groups have also been found to be effective. Some, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, meet in senior centers. Al-Anon is a support group for family and friends of people with alcohol problems. It helps them cope and find resources to address their family member's alcohol problem.61 Program Support MaterialsFor mor e infor mation, visit the SAMHSA Stor e at www v, contact SAMHSA at 1-877-SAMHSA-7 (1-877-726-4727) (English and Espa\u00f1ol), or visit the SAMHSA website at www .samhsa.go v.62 Get Connected63 Program Support MaterialsFact Sheet #6: Prescription and Over-the-Counter Medications and Older Adults Many of us hear our older relatives talk about all the pills they have to take. We rarely think about it. But nearly 20 percent of older people are addicted to various substances, such as alcohol and prescription drugs. 1 Many others misuse medications, leading to harmful drug interactions and alcohol-drug interactions. Medications of concern in older adults include those used to treat anxiety, depression, insomnia, and other mood disorders. Older adults also use over-the-counter drugs such as pain relievers and herbal supplements. Taking multiple medications and herbal supplements can lead to serious side effects and drug interactions. Therefore, it is important to ensure that older people use their medicines properly. Identifying, preventing, and treating this problem early can prevent injuries, loss of independence, hospitalization, and death. Side Effects of Some Medications Side effects of psychoactive drugs include the following: Excessive daytime drowsiness Loss of coordination, leading to falls and other problems Depression Delirium Insomnia Urinary problems Weakness Loss of appetite Constipation Withdrawal seizures64 Get ConnectedFew older people have problems with prescription pain relievers. However , pain relievers can present problems if mixed with alcohol or other medications. Drug and Alcohol Interactions Drug and alcohol interactions are of increased importance in older adults. Even social drinking can be a problem for someone taking medicine regularly. In addition, drugs stay in the body longer in older adults, so interactions are likely to be worse. Examples of dangerous drug-alcohol interactions: Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) may cause liver damage in people having more than three drinks a day. Alcohol can worsen central nervous system depression in people taking antidepressants such as Prozac, Elavil, and Wellbutrin. High doses of sedatives (such as Valium) mixed with alcohol can be lethal. Drug Interactions Most older adults take at least one prescription drug. Some take as many as eight drugs daily. This puts them at a higher risk of drug interactions. Harmful drug combinations can produce side effects such as fatigue, excessive sedation, coma, and death. Usually, however, the effects are mild. They include a change in sleep, appetite, or anxiety level. It is important to report side effects to a physician so that the dose can be adjusted. In some cases, a different medication might be needed. Risk Factors for Medication Misuse Few older adults use mood-altering drugs recreationally. Most problems stem from unintentional misuse. Misuse can take many forms, such as: Taking extra doses; Missing doses; Not following instructions; Using drugs that have expired; Not knowing about side effects; Sharing or borrowing drugs;65 Program Support Materials Intentionally misusing drugs to hurt oneself; Taking the wrong drugs; Mixing medications or drinking alcohol while taking medications; and Going to multiple physicians to get more of the same drug, such as Valium, which can lead to abuse and addiction. Risk of drug misuse among older people increases for many reasons, such as: Multiple physicians prescribing multiple drugs; Inappropriate prescribing, especially for women (e.g., prescribing the wrong medication or an inappropriate dose); Instructions and package inserts written in small print or confusing language; Failure to tell the doctor about over-the-counter medications, megadose vitamins, and herbal supplements ; Memory problems making it difficult to keep track of medication schedules; Problems taking medicine correctly because of alcohol use, depression, or self-neglect; and Missing instructions as a result of hearing or vision problems, memory problems, or language barriers. Warning Signs of a Drug Problem Warning signs of a drug problem include the following: Excessively worrying about whether mood-altering drugs are \"really working\" Worrying about having enough pills or whether it is time to take them Complaining about doctors who refuse to write prescriptions for preferred drugs Self-medicating by increasing doses of prescribed drugs that \"aren' t helping anymore\" or supplementing prescribed drugs with over-the counter drugs Withdrawing from family, friends, neighbors, and lifelong social practices Sleeping during the day and other sleep disturbances Unexplained injuries and changes in personal grooming and hygiene Expulsion from housing66 Get ConnectedWays To Avoid Medication Misuse It is possible to avoid medication misuse in many ways, including: Improving medication adherence by consumers, such as helping them read package inserts and understand instructions Encouraging health care professionals to explain carefully how and when medications must be taken and what must be avoided with prescriptions Improving doctor-patient communication\u2014encouraging patients to share concerns and ask questions about their medication Encouraging consumers to inform health care providers and pharmacists of all medications they take regularly Addressing communication barriers such as hearing impairments, vision problems, low literacy, and language barriers Providing consumer aids, such as medication tracking charts and personal drug records Implementing policy changes, such as providing geriatrics-relevant labeling information For mor e infor mation, visit the SAMHSA Stor e website at www v, contact SAMHSA at 1-877-SAMHSA-7 (1-877-726-4727) (English and Espa\u00f1ol), or visit the SAMHSA website at www .samhsa.go v.

Rockville, MD: Author .67 Program Support MaterialsFact Sheet #7: Keeping a Heal thy Outlook on Life: Ment al Heal th Conditions and Older Adul ts \"Dad doesn' t seem like himself lately . He doesn' t eat much and he sleeps all the time. He' s even stopped going to his weekly card game. Mom says she' s never seen him like this.\" \"Well, he' s 75. What can you expect? Old people get depressed.\" Sound familiar? One of the myths of aging is that it' s depressing. Although many older adults do experience depression, it isn' t necessarily a normal part of aging; anxiety and other mental health conditions aren' t normal aspects of aging either . These are serious problems that need to be addressed. Effective treatment, including medication and counseling, is available. Many times, a primary health care provider can help. Common Ment al Heal th conditions in Older Adul ts Many older adults experience mental health conditions that are not a normal part of aging. The most common are: Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder . Worry or \"nervous tension,\" rather than specific anxiety syndromes may be more common in older adults. Anxiety symptoms that do not meet the criteria for specific disorders occur in as many as 20 percent of older adults. 1,2 Up to 5 percent of older adults meet diagnostic criteria for major depression, and up to 15 percent have clinically significant symptoms that affect their functioning (otherwise known as sub-syndromal depression or minor depression). 368 Get ConnectedRecognizing Mental Health Conditions in Older Adults Problems such as anxiety and depression can be hard to recognize in older adults. Older patients may not admit to having mental health conditions because of the prejudice and discrimination associated with mental illnesses. And sadly, hurried office visits often cause some physicians to miss signs of anxiety or depression. Symptoms of anxiety include chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and abdominal distress. People with phobias experience extreme, disabling, and irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Symptoms of depression include: An \"empty\" feeling, ongoing sadness, and anxiety Loss of interest or pleasure in activities Problems with eating and weight (loss or gain) Sleep problems Irritability Tiredness and lack of energy Feelings of worthlessness, guilt, hopelessness, or helplessness Trouble focusing, remembering, or making decisions Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide Sometimes medical problems are misdiagnosed as depression and the patient receives unnecessary medication. Therefore, proper screening is important. One useful tool is the Geriatric Depression Scale (see Screening Tool #2). One important way to recognize depression is to look for changes. If a normally upbeat person seems sad for a period of time, depression may be worth exploring. Risk Factors in Older Adults Anxiety disorders trigger the body's alarm system when there is no danger. This may be due to a chemical imbalance in the body. It may also be related to an unconscious memory, a side effect of medicine, or an illness. In older adults, changes such as moving to a new home, retiring, and losing a spouse can trigger anxiety. For example, unfamiliarity with a new neighborhood may lead an older person to develop anxiety about leaving the house.69 Program Support MaterialsRisk factors for anxiety in older adults include4: Chronic medical conditions Side effects from medications Sleep disturbance Perceived (self-reported) poor health Alcohol or prescription medication misuse or abuse Physical limitations in daily activities Stressful life events Risk factors for depression in older adults include5,6: Medical illness (particularly chronic health conditions associated with disability/ decline) Perceived (self-reported) poor health, disability, or chronic pain Progressive/disabling sensory loss History of recurrent falls Sleep disturbances Cognitive impairment or dementia Medication side effects Alcohol prescription medication misuse or abuse Prior depressive episode or family history of depression Extended or long-standing bereavement Stressful life events (e.g., financial difficulties, new illness/disability, retirement or job loss) Dissatisfaction with one's social network Often, a cycle of depression can develop. A person becomes depressed and stops participating in favorite activities, leading to more depression. Impact of Mental Health conditions on Older Adults Disorders such as anxiety and depression can severely diminish quality of life. Older people may become more isolated because they are anxious about going out alone or eating in a restaurant. People with depressive symptoms, such as sleep and appetite disturbances, are at increased risk for functional and cognitive impairment, psychological distress, and death.70 Get ConnectedOlder patients with depression visit the doctor and the emer gency room more often, use more medication, incur higher outpatient char ges, and stay longer at the hospital. In addition, suicide among older adults is higher than the national average. References 1. Davis, M. J., Moye, J., & Karel, M. J. (2002). Mental health screening of older adults in primary care.

Mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety , have a tremendous impact on older people' s lives. But these problems can be treated. In fact, a range of treatments e xists for most forms of mental health conditions. Many people, including older adults, are afraid to seek help. Isolation and financial concerns can increase these fears. Older adults may not admit to having mental health conditions because of the prejudice and discrimination associated with mental illnesses. Many are embarrassed or reluctant to seek help. Promoting acceptance of mental health conditions is important in removing the discrimination associated with these problems. It is important for older adults to understand these messages: You are not alone. Depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions are more common than you think. These feelings are not your fault. Mental health conditions are real health concerns. You may feel better if you seek treatment or help. Treatment does work. The earlier you see a doctor or other health care professional and get help, the better you will feel. Mental Health Promotion Mental health promotion efforts have traditionally been devoted to children and adolescents, but the value of mental health promotion with older adults is becoming recognized. Interventions can reduce the risk of mental health conditions and lessen the consequences.72 Get ConnectedEfforts to prevent late-onset mental illnesses vary. For example, grief counseling can help prevent depression. Depression training for general practitioners has been shown to reduce suicide. Promoting good overall health can help prevent mental health conditions in older adults. Nutrition and exercise are important in keeping the mind alert. In addition, it is important for older adults to participate in social activities. Maintaining social contacts with family, friends, and the community can help ease anxiety and prevent loneliness that can lead to depression. In addition, research has shown that meditation, prayer, and other spiritual activities may help reduce stress. Improved public information is needed to educate older people about health promotion and mental health conditions. If older people understand that mental illness is not part of the normal aging process, they will be more likely to seek help. In addition, wellness programs, retirement programs, and bereavement groups are examples of ways to promote healthy aging. Assessment and Diagnosis Identifying late-life mental illnesses can be challenging. Many older adults have symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for depression or anxiety disorders. These \"subclinical\" disorders can cause significant problems. In addition, mental health conditions in older adults often occur with other medical disorders, and the symptoms may mimic or mask mental health conditions. Older individuals are more likely to report physical symptoms than psychological ones. Therefore, it helps to look for clues such as nervousness or loss of appetite. It is important to understand that individual symptoms may not be a problem, but a cluster of symptoms could indicate a mental illness. Symptoms that fall outside the normal range or that interfere with daily functioning could also indicate a problem. Primary care providers carry much of the burden for identifying mental health conditions in older adults. Unfortunately, a number of them may lack the training or experience to properly identify these conditions. Thus, many people who have depression or anxiety are not diagnosed or treated. It may be prudent to involve a geriatric specialist in the assessment process. In addition, primary care providers need to make an effort to convey messages to their patients that they are not alone and help is available.73 Program Support MaterialsFor mor e infor mation, visit the SAMHSA Stor e at www v, contact SAMHSA at 1-877-SAMHSA-7 (1-877-726-4727) (English and Espa\u00f1ol), or visit the SAMHSA website at www .samhsa.go v.Stereotypes about aging are also a problem. For example, many people believe that senility is normal. Others believe that depression is a natural part of the aging process. Therefore, they may delay encouraging relatives to seek care or may delay seeking care for themselves. Screeners such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (see Screening Tool #2) can be used to help identify problems. Sometimes older adults themselves can complete these screening tools. Some must be completed by trained professionals. These tools will not give a definite diagnosis, but they can indicate that a problem might exist. A full assessment needs to be conducted by a health care professional for a proper diagnosis to be made. Inter vention and Trea tment A wide range of options is available to treat mental health conditions. Medications are often prescribed to help stabilize a person. Individual counseling and support groups can also help older adults cope with difficult situations. Primary care settings are where most mental illnesses in older people are identified and treated. Many older people prefer to receive mental health treatment in a primary care setting. They find primary care convenient and affordable. In addition, Medicare and managed care plans promote the use of primary care physicians over specialists. Although older adults prefer primary care, many of these physicians cannot effectively treat mental health conditions. Therefore, it is advisable to include geriatric specialists in the treatment process. As the population ages, baby boomers' managed care organizations will likely focus more attention on the mental health needs of older adults. This should help increase access to care.74 Get Connected75 Program Support MaterialsScreening Tool #1: 10 Important Questions for Those Over 65 One of the more serious problems among older adults is alcohol abuse. Another problem is use of alcohol with medication, which can cause harmful interactions. Excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of health problems, such as high blood pressure, and can be fatal. Research shows that many older people use alcohol at harmful levels. The NIAAA recommends that adults 65 and older who are healthy and do not take medications drink no more than three alcoholic drinks per day, or a maximum of seven drinks per week. Women are advised to drink less because their bodies react differently to alcohol than men's do. Older adults who drink alcohol can benefit from answering the following questions. These questions are designed specifically for older adults. Your answers may indicate that you need to discuss your drinking with your doctor. QUESTIONS YES NO 1. When talking with others, do you ever underestimate how much you actually drink? 2. After a few drinks, have you sometimes not eaten or been able to skip a meal because you didn't feel hungry? 3. Does having a few drinks help decrease your shakiness or tremors? 4. Does alcohol sometimes make it hard for you to remember parts of the day or night? 5. Do you usually take a drink to relax or calm your nerves? 6. Do you drink to take your mind off your problems?76 Get ConnectedQUESTIONS YES NO 7. Have you ever increased your drinking after experiencing a loss in your life? 8. Has a doctor or nurse ever said they were worried or concerned about your drinking? 9. Have you ever made rules to manage your drinking? 10. When you feel lonely, does having a drink help? Scoring: If you have two or more \"yes\" responses, this indicates a possible alcohol problem. See your doctor.

It's part of life. But when we stop enjoying things we used to and have trouble getting up in the morning, the problem may be more serious. Being depressed for a while, without letup, can change the way you think or feel. It's a myth that depression is a natural part of aging. But it is a common problem. Up to 5 percent of older adults meet diagnostic criteria for major depression, and up to 15 percent have clinically significant depressive symptoms that affect their functioning. 1 Depression can be treated successfully. Options include \"talk\" therapy, medication, and other methods. There is no reason to suffer. Although common among older adults, depression is often missed or untreated. Sometimes people think a depressed person is just cranky. Or they think that confusion caused by depression is a sign of Alzheimer's. Depression isn't your fault. It could be caused by your medicine. Or maybe you've had a hard time dealing with retirement. The important thing is to get help as soon as possible. If left untreated, depression can lead to physical, mental health, and social issues. Many different scales are used to tell if someone is depressed. One popular tool is the Geriatric Depression Scale. It is easy to use and requires no special medical knowledge. This scale has been tested and validated in many settings. The Geriatric Depression Scale is not a substitute for a diagnosis by a professional. But it can help you see if you need to talk to your doctor about depression. If you've been feeling sad for several weeks or think you may be depressed, you can benefit from answering these questions. No matter what you score on this questionnaire, it's a good idea to see a health care professional if you feel that problems with depression are affecting your life. The questions from the Geriatric Depression Scale are on the back of this fact sheet. Feel free to copy it and share it with others.78 Get ConnectedCheck Your Mood (GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE) QUESTIONS YES NO 1. Are you basically satisfied with your life? 2. Have you dropped many of your activities and interests? 3. Do you feel like your life is empty? 4. Do you often get bored? 5. Are you in good spirits most of the time? 6. Are you afraid that something bad is going to happen to you? 7. Do you feel happy most of the time? 8. Do you often feel helpless? 9. Do you prefer to stay at home, rather than going out and doing new things? 10. Do you feel you have more problems with memory than most people? 11. Do you think it is wonderful to be alive now? 12. Do you feel pretty worthless the way you are now? 13. Do you feel full of energy?79 Program Support MaterialsQUESTIONS YES NO 14. Do you feel that your situation is hopeless? 15. Do you think that most people are better off than you are? Scoring: For questions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 15, score one point for each \"Yes\" response. For questions 1, 5, 7, 11, and 13, score one point for each \"No\" response. If you score more than five points, please follow up with your doctor . Source: Sheikh, J. I., & Yesavage, J. A. (1986).

For example, alcohol affects men and women differently. The NIAAA's safe drinking limits are explained below. The NIAAA recommends that adults 65 and older who are healthy and do not take medications drink no more than three alcoholic drinks per day, or a maximum of seven drinks per week. Women are advised to drink somewhat less than these levels because their bodies react differently to alcohol than men's do. The Standard Drink One alcoholic drink means: 12 ounces of beer; 5 ounces of wine; or 1.5 ounces of liquor (80 proof). These drinking guidelines are not intended for: People who plan to drive or perform activities requiring attention; People taking prescription medicines or over-the-counter drugs; People with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes; or People who are in recovery from alcohol problems. If an individual does not drink (abstains), starting to drink is not advised. Recommended safe drinking limits do not take into account body weight, patterns of drinking, or spacing of drinks. This is particularly important for older adults 82 Get Connected(especially older women), in whom the toxic effects of alcohol are increased.
