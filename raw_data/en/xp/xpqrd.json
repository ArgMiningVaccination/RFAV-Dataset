Best Crystals for Spirituality Here are 12 of our favorite crystals that have the power to awaken and balance the spirituality within us... Amethyst First and foremost, we have [Amethyst](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/amethyst) [, which is an amazing stone for the ](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/amethyst) [third eye chakra](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/third-eye-chakra-stones) and [crown chakra](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/crown-chakra-stones). It is connected the [12th house](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/twelfth-house-in-astrology) in Astrology (the house of Pisces) that governs dreams, spirituality, subconsciousness and psychic powers. Amethyst is a crystal for spirituality above all else. It opens the two highest chakras, balances them, and protects them. Wearing Amethyst around your neck or on your ears, keeping it below your pillow, or meditating with it is a great way to use it. Clear Quartz The next crystal for spirituality on our list is [Clear Quartz](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/clear-quartz). This is a foundational stone, and it is the basis for crystal work and crystal healing. This [spirituality stone](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/spirituality-stones) balances and works wonders on all of the chakras. Clear Quartz is a great protector, so no matter how bumpy and rocky our spiritual journey might be, it makes sure we get to our \"destination\" safely. It also has the power to reset and cleanse other crystals, as well as amplifying their healing properties. Labradorite Another one of the most powerful crystals for spirituality is definitely [Labradorite](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/labradorite). This stone isn't only majestic to gaze at, but it's an excellent support that keeps us grounded through the challenging tides of life. If the Tower (Tarot card) comes up in your reading, Labradorite is a must have stone for your personal arsenal. Labradorite can be worn around your [heart chakra](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/heart-chakra-stones) and [solar plexus chakra](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/solar-plexus-chakra-stones), or you can wear it as a bracelet or keep it in your pocket. Lapis Lazuli This is a very special stone, and it's even nicknamed the enlightenment stone. [Lapis Lazuli](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/lapis-lazuli) is at the very top of the [list of crystals](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/list-of-crystals) for spirituality. Cleopatra (and other Egyptian mystics) used it not only as an eye shadow color, but for magic rituals, too. Lapis Lazuli is a [third eye stone](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/third-eye-chakra-stones), helping to keep it open, receptive, and charged. When crushed into fine dust, we get the deepest royal blue color that there is, and when used as an eye shadow, it is said to provide second sight. It is recommended to have prolonged lying sessions of meditation with this stone on your third Eye. Doing so is said to offer powers of foresight. You can pair it up with Amethyst and place them beneath your pillow on a [New Moon](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/crystals-for-new-moon) in Scorpio and write down your dreams in the following days to record your personal experience. Kyanite [Kyanite](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/kyanite) is considered one of the best crystals for spirituality as it helps us acknowledge and speak our own truth. It's a soothing stone that eliminates obstacles in our throat and eases the symptoms of a cold that can be caused by swallowed emotions. Kyanite is great for when you're trying to stay silent in order to avoid conflict, but instead you end up starting a war within yourself. It's a given that it is worn around the neck where it can best influence the [throat chakra](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/throat-chakra-stones). Kyanite also influences the \"hidden\" chakra at the back of our heads, right where the skull conjoins the neck. As a result, placing your Kyanite below your pillow can provide vivid dreams that offer clues about how to improve your public speaking and ease anxiety. Selenite Similar in structure to Kyanite, [Selenite](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/selenite) is a very gentle and soothing stone. It works wonders on the Heart chakra and it can make you and your dreams very receptive to subtle energies around you. If you wish to level up on your spiritual path, or if you feel as if you've hit a \"dead end\" on your spiritual journey, Selenite is a stone that can come to your rescue. Since it's connected with the moon and [feminine energy](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/how-to-radiate-feminine-energy-with-crystals), it can help you heal trauma through following of the moon phases. If you can, wear it on your Heart chakra, keep it beneath your pillow, and place one on your [desk](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/feng-shui-desk-tips) where you spend a lot of time. Selenite connects the Heart chakra with the Crown chakra and eases the communication between the two and the spirit realm. Black Obsidian Next on our list of crystals for spirituality is [Black Obsidian](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/black-obsidian), the lava stone. This stone once was molten lava, it came from the heart of our planet itself. It was first the blood of our planet, and it felt and saw places we can never see. Obsidian is one of the most prominent stones that activates the spiritual pathways and clears obstacles to help us get where we want to go. Black Obsidian keeps the fire and thirst for knowledge burning in our hearts, and at the same time, it keeps us grounded and aligned with the Earth's energies. One of the most productive ways to work with Black Obsidian is to place it between your palms and focus on feeling its heat that once flowed through our Earth. If you have a specific chakra in mind that you want to work on, make sure to visualize it, too. Howlite [Howlite](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/howlite) has the power to protect us, especially when we're off dreaming or meditating. It dissolves the threats that are aimed at our auric field. It soothes our third eye chakra and calms an overactive mind. Howlite has the power to keep us grounded in our own bodies, and it disperses insomnia. Similar to Selenite, it's a gentle stone that works its \"magic\" on a very subtle and feminine level. Wearing a Howlite around your neck can help you achieve great things in the long run for your spiritual journey and it can help you a great deal on your spiritual paths, especially if you suffer from an overactive mind. Serpentine We've come to a stone on our list that has amazing healing and retrieving properties for the Crown chakra and fir past lives work. [Serpentine](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/serpentine) is also considered the stone of the brave. This spiritual stone helps guide us on our spiritual journey and it clears our chakras. It especially stimulates the Crown chakra and the influx of knowledge from the higher realms. Serpentine is also known to enhance and open psychic abilities. Serpentine is wonderful for Kundalini Reiki practitioners as it has the power to guide us straight to the problematic areas. It helps us direct our healing energy straight into the affected areas and it keeps them clean and balanced for a long time afterwards. Shiva Lingam [Shiva Lingam](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/shiva-lingam) is considered to be a very special stone on our spiritual crystal scale. It is said that it comes from a meteorite that crashed into our Earth many years ago. As it is of that peculiar origin, it has the cosmic power of knowledge and the vastness of the universe embedded in it. Shiva Lingam has been a great aid on many spiritual journeys. Yogis and Gurus are known to use it in their spiritual practices. It is said to help achieve nirvana and enlightenment for short periods of time as it helps inner workings flow smoother. Super Seven [Super Seven](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/super-seven) is one of the best crystals for spirituality because it is a very potent combination of seven minerals, including: Amethyst, Cacoxenite, Lepidocrocite, Goethite, Clear Quartz, Rutile, and Smokey Quartz. Due to its high frequency, it does not require cleansing and can assist in the cleansing of other crystals. Super Seven is like a nitro boost for the body, and thus, your spiritual journey. If you manage to acquire it, you should make good use of it. It's a rare stone, and as such it's highly valued. Super Seven is a magnificent stone to have as it covers all 7 chakras, and it works on all 7 levels of existence simultaneously. You can wear it around your neck, as a bracelet, or just place a piece of it on your third eye during your meditations, and below your pillow during sleep. Lodolite [Lodolite](https://cosmiccuts.com/collections/lodolite) is a stone for shamanic practices and dream travels, and it is a portal to other dimensions. It's also marvelous for mediations! You should definitely use it for [shadow work](https://cosmiccuts.com/blogs/healing-stones-blog/crystals-for-shadow-work), astral travel, lucid dreaming, and portal-gazing. Lodolite is a stone that is considered out of this world, and it is said that if you look at it long enough and empty your mind, you can see into other dimensions, and you can meet other forms of life. Lodolite is an amazing stone and aid for spiritual journeying and regression into past (and future!) lives. Keep it around your neck, on your crown chakra and on your third eye for the best results. Final Thoughts Use these crystals for spirituality to embark on a new path of spiritual awakening. You're likely to be surprised how much meditating next to an [Amethyst Geode](https://cosmiccuts.com/pages/the-amazing-amethyst-geode) or carrying Howlite in your pocket can make a difference in your spiritual life. * Crystals and stones should not be used as a substitute for medical advice or treatment.
