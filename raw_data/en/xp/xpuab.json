High blood cholesterol is linked to CVD events. In addition to lifestyle optimization, s tatins are the fi rst-choice treatment to reduce high blood choles- terol and consequently prevent CVD events . of primary preven- tion of CVD using statins in low or medium risk populations is a topic of debate. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the HT A is to investigate the clinical efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness (covering all HTA domains) of statins compared to no treatment (including life- style adaptations) in primary prevention of CVD in certain CVD risk groups . METHODS: Systematic literature searches were performed in PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase to identify relevant published evidence for the HTA domains . For the clinical and cost -effective- ness domains, data was extracted from the included studies in predefined evidence tables and summary tables were made for different study types. For the other domains (including ethical, le- gal, social , and organi sational issues ), the evidence was described narratively. The preliminary lit- erature search on the cost -effectiveness of statins for primary prevention of CVD in Switzerland did not provide sufficient evidence. Therefore, a de novo cost -effectiveness Markov model was de- veloped, characterising the natural history of the disease in a patient's lifetime in the Swiss clinical practice. This cost -effectiveness model was used to determine the cost -effectiveness of statin therapy versus no statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD applying a lifetime time horizon, discounting of costs and effects with 3%, and assuming real -world adherence (69% in year 1, 60% in subsequent years). The uncertainty around input parameters was explored in sensitivity and scenario analyses. In addition, the maximum annual population- level healthcare costs assuming real-world adherence were estimated. RESULTS: Evidence from two high quality systematic reviews including data of 37 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) informed the HTA domains efficacy and safety of statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in adults. Two high quality non- randomised studies provided additional data on HTA Repo rt 3 effectiveness and safety. No studies were found on the efficacy of lifestyle adaptations (in combina- tion with statin therapy) for primary prevention of CVD in adults. Statin therapy showed to be effec- tive in the prevention of cardiovas cular events and mortality in adults without established CVD. The available data from non- randomised studies was too scarce to draw conclusions on the effective- ness of statins. In most studies, treatment with statins did not result in an increased risk of adverse events. Statin use only resulted in a significant risk increase for hepatic dysfunction (low quality of evidence) and renal dysfunction (moderate quality of evidence). However, there are limitations re- garding the definitions of these outcomes in the RCTs. The available evidence for the adverse event myalgia was inconsistent. A lthough the comparative evidence for safety is inconclusive, the adverse event rate of using statins was low . No evidence of efficacy, effectiveness, or safety for the different CVD risk groups (low, medium and high) could be presented as risk scores for CVD were hardly reported in the studies. Results from the de novo economic model show ed that from a healthcare payers perspective, ap- plying a lifetime time horizon with discount ing, and assuming real-world treatment adherence and no discontinuation due to adverse events, statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD seems to be associated with low ICERs compared to no statin therapy in subgroups with a low, moderate or high CVD ri sk (i.e. an AGLA risk above 1% ), especially for those at younger age and females . ICERs were higher in subgroups with low CVD risk (expressed in AGLA risk) , older age and in male s. The scenario and sensitivity analyses showed that a shorter time horizon, applying a higher discount factor , and reduced treatment adherence increased the ICERs significantly. In addition, the effec- tiveness of statins in reducing CVD events , the proportion of MI versus CVD deaths, and the costs of statin therapy were important parameters that introduced uncertainty about the cost -effectiveness of statin therapy. Due to a lack of data on the current use of statins for primary prevention of CVD in various CVD risk groups in Switzerland, the budget impact of restricted reimbursement policies compared to the cur- rent unrestricted use of statins in Switzerland could not be determined. Instead, the maximum pop- ulation -level annual healthcare costs of reimbursement policies were estimated assuming all eligible patients would use statins wi th real -world adherence . The annual costs of reimbursing statin thera- pies, from a healthcare payers perspective in the Swiss context , ranged from 934 million CHF in case all low , moderate, high and very high risk individuals were to be treated with statins to approx- imately 4 million CHF in the most restricted reimbursement policy where statin therapies were only reimbursed for people between 60 and 75 years old at high CVD risk. Relevant legal, social, ethical, and organisational issues identified included that changes in reim- bursement policy can further increase health disparities between patients based on sex, race, and socioeconomic status and that real-world adherence to statins differs greatly from adherence in a clinical setting, especially in case of primary prevention. CONCLUSION: Sufficient evidence shows that statin therapy prescribed to adults without estab- HTA Repo rt 4 lished CVD is effec -tive in the prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality under study condi- tions (i.e. efficacy), but there is limited evidence on safety and effectiveness under real -world set- tings. Risk scores for CVD were hardly reported in the studies and no stratification of the efficacy, effectiveness, or safety results was available for people with low, medium, or (very) high CVD ris k. Statins can prevent CVD events in patients without CVD without many adverse events at a reason- able cost , especially in subgroups with an AGLA risk score above 1% The cost -effectiveness of statin therapy is highly dependent on model settings and uncertai n input parameters. Furthermore, as there is no data on the current use of statins for primary prevention of CVD events in Switzerland, the exact cost savings of disinvestment in statin therapies for the national healthcare bei le traitement statines dans pr\u00e9vention ou l'absence de traite- ment (y compris l'adaptation du mode de vie) dans pr\u00e9vention MCV au sein l'efficacit\u00e9 clinique et rapport co\u00fbt -efficacit\u00e9, les maladie cours de la vie d'un patient traite- dans enti\u00e8re, sur une actualisation des co\u00fbts et des effets de 3 % et sur une adh\u00e9sion th\u00e9rapeutique r\u00e9elle (69 % \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle de la sur conditions d'adh\u00e9sion r\u00e9- elles.

The objective of a health technology assessment (HTA) is to generate a focused assessment of various aspects of a health technology. The analytic methods applied to assess the value of using a health tech- nology are described. The analytical process is comparative, systematic, transparent, and involves mul- tiple stakeholders. The domains covered in an HTA r eport include clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety, cost -effectiveness, budget impact, legal, social, ethical, and organisational issues. The purpose is to inform health policy and decision- making to promote an efficient, sustainable, equitable, and high- quality health system. HTA Repo rt 22 1 Policy q uestion and c ontext Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is ranked as the number one cause of mortality and is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. High blood cholesterol is linked to CVD events. Statins, cholesterol lowering drugs, are the first -choice treatments to reduce high blood cholesterol. There is strong evidence of the effectiveness of statins in people who experienced a cardiovascular event (secondary prevention)1 and in people at high risk of CVD (primary prevention)1. Evidence on the effec- tiveness and cost -effectiveness of statin use in people at low or medium risk of CVD is limited.2 Therefore, the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of primary prevention of CVD using statins in low or medium risk pop- ulations is not known. As the size of these lower risk groups is large, prescribing statins to all these people has a large impact on the national healthcare budget. The aim of the HTA theme brought forward by the applicant c urafutura a is to investigate the clinical effec- tiveness, safety , and cost -effectiveness (including all HTA domains) of statins in primary prevention of CVD in Switzerland. 2 Research question What are the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety, as well as the costs (cost -effectiveness) and budget impact of statin therapy in adults (and for different age groups) without established CVD and with low, medium, and (very) high CVD risk (i.e. primary prevention) compared to placebo, no treatment, or adap- tion of lifestyle? 3 Medical b ackground CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and comprise a wide range of diseases. According to the definition of the World Health Organisation (WHO), CVDs include the following. 3 Coronary heart disease (disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle), including my- ocardial infarction (MI), and angina. Cerebrovascular disease (disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain), including ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. a Curafutura is a Swiss health insurer association. HTA Repo rt 23 Peripheral arterial disease (disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs). Rheumatic heart disease (damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria). Congenital heart disease (malformations of heart structure existing at birth). Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs). There are often no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels; a heart attack or stroke may be the first sign of underlying disease. Symptoms of a heart attack include pain or discomfort in the centre of the chest, in the arms, left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back. Stroke is mostly associated with sudden weakness of the face, arm, or leg; mostly on one side of the body. Symptoms of rheumatic heart disease include shortness of breath, fatigue, irregular heartbeats, chest pain, and fainting. 4 CVDs place a high social burden on developed countries, including impaired quality of life, reduced eco-nomic activity, and large use of health service resources. 2 Furthermore, CVDs remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for both women and men in Western countries, such as Switzerland.5 Globally, there were about 423 million prevalent CVD cases in 2015. The age- standardised prevalence of CVD varied by country; in Switzerland the number of prevalent cases per 100,000 was in the range of 3,601 to 5,600, as in most neighbour countries (Figure 1).6 In 2016, approximately 17.6 million deaths were attributed to CVD globally, which represents an increase of 14.5% from 2006. In Switzerland the age -adjusted death rate for CVD was 112.1 per 100,000 in men and 44.7 per 100,000 in women.7 Figure 1. Global map of age -standardised prevalence of CVD i n 20156 Important risk factors for CVD include genetic factors and behavioural factors such as tobacco use, un- healthy diets, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of these behaviours may appear in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, overweight, and obesity.4 HTA Repo rt 24 As documented by genetic, pathology, observational, and intervention studies, dyslipidaemia and espe- cially hypercholesterolaemia plays a crucial role in the development of CVD. Most cholesterol is normally carried in the blood in low -density lipoprotein (LDL). There is a strong positive association between LDL and CVD risk: reducing the plasma LDL concentration by 1.0 mmol/L causes a corresponding 20% to 25% risk reduction in CVD mortality and non- fatal MI.8 This correlation exists in both men and women and in those with and wi thout established CVD. The reduction of LDL is therefore of prime concern in the prevention of CVD.9 LDL consists of several subclasses of particles with dierent sizes and densities , which have different atherogenic potential . For example small dense LDL has great atherogenic potential , therefore the small dense LDL proportion is a better marker for prediction of CVD than total LDL.10 Smoking cessation, healthy diets, and regular physical activity can lower the risk of CVD. In addition, drug treatment may be necessary to reduce the plasma LDL -C concentration and as a result lower the CVD risk.4 Statins are a class of lipid- lowering drugs and are first choice agents for reducing plasma LDL- C.2- 11 Statins may be used for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD: primary prevention comprises treating people without es tablished CVD (but who may be at risk of future CVD events), whereas second- ary prevention involves treating persons with established CVD.11 It is important for clinicians to be able to assess CVD risk rapidly and accurately, so that they can make the right management decisions. Prev ention of CVD should be adapted to an individual's total CVD risk: the higher the risk, the more intense the action should be. 9 Several scoring systems, with various ad- vantages and disadvantages, exist to assess CVD risk, such as the Prospective Cardiovascular M\u00fcnster Model by the Arbeitsgruppe Lipide und Atherosklerose, a workgroup of the Swiss Society of Card iology (PROCAM/AGLAb), Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation tool algo- rithm of Cardiology/American Heart Association ( ACC/AHAe) pooled cohort equation, and the Framingham Risk Score ( FRSf). The working group on lipids and atherosclerosis (AGLA) promotes the use of the AGLA or SCORE risk score for the estimation of CVD risk , but the AGLA score is most often used in Swiss clinical practice.12 The AGLA risk score is based on the Prospective Cardiovascular M\u00fcnster (PROCAM) Weibull model.13 The AGLA adjusted the PROCAM by a calibration factor (0.7) to the lower risk of coronary heart disease b https://www.agla.ch/risikoberechnung/agla-risikorechner c https://www.escardio.org/Education/Practice -Tools/CVD 25 (CHD) in Switzerland compared to Germany.14 SCORE is the European risk scoring system based on the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation project.15 The main difference between the risk scoring systems is that AGLA provides the risk of fatal CHD events and non- fatal MI, while SCORE provides t he risk of fatal CVD events (including MI, stroke, and coronary revascularization). Romanens et al. showed that the agreement between the AGLA and SCORE risk scores is limited. Many people with an AGLA risk below 10% were at intermediate or even at high ri sk with SCORE.14 Table 3.1.

HTA Repo rt 26 4 Technolog y Statins, or hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, are one of the most widely prescribed groups of drugs in the world since their introduction to the market more than twenty years ago.16 Currently, six statin (mono- )drugs are available on the Swiss market. Statins block the HMG CoA reductase enzymes in the liver which play a key role in cholesterol synthe- sis.17,18 Generally, statins are tolerated well by pat ients. However, some adverse events associated with the intake of statins, e.g. liver dysfunction and myopathy, have been shown to occur.16 Typically, statins are administered in the form of tablets, which are to be taken once daily.19 Often, statin therapy is taken for life, as ceasing statin therapy will result in higher cholesterol levels within a few weeks. The evidence on the beneficial effects of statin therapy has led to the promotion of their use on a global scale, particularly in the developed world. The overwhelming body of evidence supporting statin therapy, resulted in recommendations in the guidelines of the American Heart Association20, the European Society of Cardiology21, Atherosklerose (AGLA).12 Cons equently, statins are currently seen as the first choice drugs for LDL cholesterol reduction.22 4.2 Alternative technologies Lifestyle changes are often advised before or in conjunction with statin therapy, as these can (further) reduce the cholesterol level and CVD risk. Lifestyle changes that reduce the CVD risk include: 1) healthy and Mediterranean diet, 2) regular exercising, 3) maintaining a healthy weight, and 4) smoking reduction or smoking cessation. 19 Since the focus of the current project is on the cost -effectiveness of statins, other cholesterol lowering drugs such as PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe are outside the scope of this project . 4.3 Regulatory status / p rovider Statins have been used in Switzerland since the and generics). They must be prescribed by a medical doctor. Currently, s tatins are reimbursed without any restrictions (if used in their licenced indication) in Switzerland. HTA Repo rt 27 5 PICO Table 5.1.

The applied SR methodology follows international standards, such as the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines for performing SRs, and the reporting of this SR foll ows the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA).23,24 The SR process consists of the following fundamental steps: 1. Formulation of the research questions 2. Comprehensive information search, including defining data sources and search strategy 3. Selection procedure, applying pre- determined inclusion and exclusion criteria 4. Critical appraisal (quality and risk of bias assessment) 5. Data extraction and data synthesis HTA Repo rt 30 6. Quality control The following sections describe the applied systematic review methodology of the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of statins in primary prevention of CVD; the methodology of the cost -effectiveness SR is de- scribed in detail in Chapter 8.1. 7.1.1 Databases and search strategy Since a large amount of studies is published on statin therapy for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults without established CVD, we implemented a stepwise approach for the efficacy, effec- tiveness, and safety systematic literature search: I. Search for SRs and meta- analyses. II. Update search for RCTs based on the most relevant/recent included SRs on statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD events and mortality. III. Search for long- term outcomes in non- randomised studies (i.e. non- randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case- control studies) . In search step I a systematic literature search was conducted to find relevant SRs on our review objec- tives. Other new RCTs might have been published after the closing search date of the incl uded SRs. Therefore, we conducted update searches in a second review step to fill the gap for recently published RCTs. RCTs do not report on effectiveness outcomes and mostly not on long- term safety outcomes; to close the gap on these specific outcomes a t hird search step to identify non- randomised studies was incorporated. This project also aims to close the gap to the HTA published in 2013 in the report 'Statine zur Prim\u00e4rpr\u00e4vention kardiovaskul\u00e4rer Erkrankungen' by the strategy PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase.com databases were searched for peer -reviewed scientific literature. The searches were built using the PICO framework ( Table 5.1). Since there is large overlap in studies included in other literature databases (such as Cochrane Library) for the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety search it was decided to search in these two main databases. Given the various outcomes of interest, it was decided to keep the search broad. Only search strings on 'Patient' (i.e. CVD) and 'Inter- vention' (i.e. primary prevention with statins) were compiled in combination with a search string for study designs. The applied search fil ters were publication period (2013- 2019 for the reviews and non- random- ised studies search; and 2012- 2019 for the RCT search, based on the search strategies of the included SRs of Yebyo et al. 2019 26 and Taylor et al. 20132) and the language of the publications ( German, English, HTA Repo rt 31 French, and Dutch). Furthermore, animal studies, case reports, and non- pertinent publication types (e.g. editorials, letter, and comments) were excluded with additional search strings. Also, SRs were excluded with a search string in review step II and III. The details of the search strategies are included in Appendix 15.1. The search for SRs was conducted on 22 May 2019, and the search for RCTs and non- randomised studies was conducted on 9 July 2019. The literature database output, including all indexed fields per record (e.g. title, authors, and abstract) , was exported to Endnote version X7.8. Duplicates in Endnote were automatically removed and further manually deleted. Selection procedure From the articles retrieved from PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase.com the relevant references were se- lected by a two- step selection procedure, base d on: 1. Screening of title and abstract: this step yielded the articles that were assessed in full text. The major topics of the articles were assessed on relevancy for the objectives by the title and abstract. In this step, articles that seemed to contain relevant data for the objectives were selected for full - text screening, while articles that did not seem to contain relevant data were not selected for full - text assessment. In case of doubt, the study was assessed in full text. 2. Screening of full article: the articles selected during the first phase were assessed in full text. Articles were included if the reported information was relevant and of sufficient quality, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below). The process of selection and inc lusion and exclusion of articles was registered in an Endnote library by one of the researchers. The implemented quality control during the selection process is described in a next section. Inclusion and exclusion criteria The inclusion and exclusion crit eria applied during the selection processes of the three search steps are presented in Table 7.1. Table 7.1.

Quality control HTA Repo rt 33 The following quality control measures were applied during the selection process: The first 30% of titles and abstracts from the peer -reviewed literature were screened in duplicate by two independent researchers. The results were compared and discussed before the remaining references were assessed by one researcher. Both researchers categorised the titles as 'include for full -text assessment', 'exclude for full -text assessment', or 'doubt'. If there were differences between the two researchers regarding more than 2% of the articles selected as 'include for full - text assessment', another 10% of the articles would have been screened in duplicate. This would have been repeated if necessary. If there was still more than 2% discrepancy at 50% of the du- plicate selection, the screening of title and abstracts would have been done fully in duplicate by two independent researchers. If the two reviewers disagreed on the relevance of a study, this was discussed. If the differences remained after discussion, the study was asses sed in full text. During screening there was less than 2% discrepancy between the two researchers. The first 10% of the full -text articles from the peer -reviewed literature were assessed for relevancy and critically appraised in duplicate by two independen t researchers. The results were compared and discussed early in the process. If there were differences between the two researchers re- garding more than 5% of the articles screened in duplicate, another 10% of the articles would have been screened in duplicate. This would have been repeated if necessary. If there was still more than 5% discrepancy at 50% of the duplicate selection, the screening of full -text articles would have been done fully in duplicate by two independent researchers. During screening ther e was less than 5% discrepancy between the two researchers. The remaining full -text selection was done by one researcher in close collaboration with a second reviewer; any doubts were discussed in detail. In case of discrepancy or disagreements during the selection phase, a third researcher was consulted. The study was discussed until consensus was reached. 7.1.2 Other s ources During the full -text screening phase, reference lists of relevant SRs found with our systematic literature search were checked to find an y other studies or SRs that were not captured with our literature search. For the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety review, three SRs were included by this process and assessed in full text in the scoping phase. 7.1.3 Assessment of quality of evidence System atic reviews The quality of the included SRs was assessed with the AMSTAR -2 checklist (see Appendix 15.2) .27 HTA Repo rt 34 RCTs No additional RCTs were included in the scoping phase. For the quality assessment of the individual RCTs included in the two selected SRs of Yebyo et al. 201926 and Taylor et al. 20132, we built on the applied assessments in these SRs and we did not redo their critical appraisal . Both SRs used the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs (see Appendix 15.2)28, which categorises the risk of bias of the do- mains in l ow risk of bias , moderate or unclear risk of bias , or high risk of bias . Furthermore, Yebyo et al . 201926 summarised the risk of bias values for each of the domains and interpreted the overall quality of a RCT as: Good quality: all criteria met (i.e. low risk of bias for each domain) using the Cochrane risk of bias tool; Fair quality: o ne criterion not met (i.e. high risk of bias for one domain) or two criteria unclear, and the assessment that this was unlikely to have biased the outcome, and there is no known important limitation that could invalidate the results; Poor quality: one criterion not met (i.e. high risk of bias for one domain) or two cr iteria unclear, and the assessment that this was likely to have biased the outcome, and there are important limitations that could invalidate the results. We also applied th ese summarised risk of bias values to the RCTs reported only in Taylor et al. 20132, as they did not report this themselves . The overall quality of the evidence was assessed by Yebyo et al.26 using the GRADE (Grading of Rec- ommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations)29 approach based on five domains : Risk of bias: the 'internal validity' of the evidence (as assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs; see above). Inconsistency: the heterogeneity or variabil ity in the estimates of treatment effect across studies. Indirectness: the degree of differences between the population, intervention, comparator for the intervention and outcome of interest across studies. Imprecision: the extent to which confidence in the effect estimate is adequate to support a partic- ular decision. Publication bias: the degree of selective publication of studies. The overall quality of evidence is classified as high, moderate, low, or very low: High: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Moderate: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Low: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain. Yebyo et al. did not report a detailed GRADE Summary of Findings Table in their SR or supplementary material. The GRADE appr oach was not applied in the SR of Taylor et al. 2013. HTA Repo rt 35 Non-randomised studies Since both Yebyo et al. 2019 and Taylor et al. 2013 assessed the quality of the i ncluded RCT s based on the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews 5.0.22, we decided to keep in line with Cochrane and use the quality assessment tool for our included non- randomised studies as sug- gested in that version of the handbook: the Newcastle - Ottawa quality assessment scale (see Appendix 15.2) .30 7.1.4 Methodology data analyses efficacy, effectiveness and safety The data extraction and meta- analyses presented in the two included SR s of Yebyo et al. 201926 and Taylor et al. 20132 were the basis for our data synthesis. When outcomes of interest were reported in both SRs, the more up- to-date data reported in the review of Yebyo et al. w as preferred over Taylor et al. Yebyo et al. performed a random -effect pairwise meta- analysis of all statins as a class and estimated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval s (CI) for each outcome. H eterogeneity was inspected using the I2-statistic. Furthermore, they conducted sensitivity analyses and explored the im pact on outcomes by excluding RCTs that included participants with for example a higher proportion ( >90%) of cases with diabetes mellitus.26 Taylor et al. used the fixed- effect method for their meta- analysis ; unless data were heterogen eous (i.e. I2 statistic was >50% ), then the random -effects model was used. R isk ratios and odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs were calculated for dichotomous data. For continuous data ( e.g. change in blood cholesterol) pooled mean differences (MD) with 95% CI s were calculated. They considered analys es for potential effect modifiers (i.e. for gender , extent of hyperlipidaemia, and age greater than and less than 65 years ), but those were abandoned due t o lack of adequate reporting.2 The risk ratios and odds ratios including 95% CIs for the efficacy and safety outcomes are summarised in an overview figure (see Figure 5 in Chapter 7.2.4). For interpretation of the results, the l ine of no effect and areas of the plot which represent the outcomes in favour of the statin or in favour of the control gr oup are clearly highlighted. The data from the two included no n-randomised studies was extracted in a data extraction table and descriptively summarised in the sections on effectiveness and safety . HTA Repo rt 36 7.2 Results efficacy, effectiveness, and safety 7.2.1 Evidence base pertaining to e fficacy, effectiveness and safety The evaluation of the overall effectiveness of the technology encompasses its efficacy, its effectiveness and its safety. Efficacy is the extent to which a specific health technology produces a beneficial, reproducible result under study conditions compared with alternative technologies (internal validity). Effectiveness is the extent to which a specific health technology, when applied in real world cir- cumstances in the target group, does what it is intended to do for a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose regarding the benefits compared with alternative technologies (external validity). Safety is a judgement of the harmful effects and their severity using the health technology. Rele- vant adverse events are those that result in death, are life- threatening, requi re inpatient hospital- isation or cause prolongation of existing hospitali sation (serious adverse events) and those that occur repetitively and the most frequent (highest rate). 7.2.2 PRISMA flow diagram Search step I: Search for systematic reviews In the f irst search step, 370 unique records were identified in PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase.com. The PRISMA flowchart is presented in Figure 2. Of those, 350 records were excluded based on their title and abstract. Three SR s were included as a result of the hand- search of reference lists of relevant SRs , re- sulting in 23 SRs which were screened in full -text. For the first search step, SRs were selected with a broad focus on CVD in populations with mixed CVD risk (i.e. not aim ed at one specific CVD disease such as stroke, or a specific risk group such as patients with diabetes mellitus or a population of older persons). The reasons for exclusion were no data on objectives (n=3), meta- analysis includes primary and second- ary prev ention trials (n=2), SR on one specific disease (n=2), population of older persons only (n=3), comparator not in line with our PICO (n=1), lacking review methodology (n=2), and non- pertinent publi- cation type (n=2). One review was not available in full text (see reference below flowchart ). Initially, in the scoping protocol seven SRs were selected on statin therapy for the prevention of CVD events. After more detailed full -text assessment and between- study comparison of the quality and reported outcomes in these SRs, five SRs were eventually excluded (see description of the exclusion reasons in Figure 2) and two SRs (Yebyo et al. 201926 and Taylor et al. 20132) were included. The results of two excluded relevant but less recent SRs, Chou et al. 201631 and Naci et al. 201332, were compared with the results of the SR of Yebyo et al. 201926 (see Table II and Table III in Appendix 15.3). We conclude that their review results and conclusions are in line with the included SR of Yebyo et al.26, and therefore exclusion of the less HTA Repo rt 37 recent SRs is justified. The SR of Yebyo et al. 2019 did not include all predefined outcomes of interest, including the outcomes on blood cholesterol. Therefore, the older S R of Taylor et al. 2013 was included to complement Yebyo et al. 2019 , after expert consultation with a cardiologist. The applied search strategy in these two SRs was used for an update search on recently published RCTs. This search was also used to develop a search strategy for long- term outcomes in non- randomised studies. The latter search was also built on the search conducted by the Swiss Medical Board25; i.e. starting the sear ch in 2013. Figure 2. PRISMA flowchart systematic reviews on statins for primary prevention of CVD Date of search: 22 May 2019 * 18 of the 19 RCTs included in the Chou, 2016 review were included in Yebyo, 2019 or Taylor, 2013; one RCT was not covered and will be excluded by our criterion for the inclusion of Western countries only: Helji B, Velija- Asimi Z, Kuli M.

Experimental and Clinical Cardiology. 2014;20(1):1222- 7. Three reviews in older populations (Ponce, 2019; Teng, 2015; Savarese, 2013) were excluded after a detailed check. There is almost complete overlap in the in- cluded RCTs in these three reviews and all RCTs, except one less recent RCT published in 2003, are covered in the included reviews of Yebyo, 2019 and Taylor, 2013. HTA Repo rt 38 Search step II: Update search for RCTs based on the included systematic reviews In total, 2 ,290 unique records were identified in PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase.com for the second search step ( Figure 3). Of those, 2 ,281 records were excluded based on their title and abstract, resulting in nine RCTs selected to be screened in full text. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all nine RCTs were excluded, because of the following reasons: non- western country (n=1), no data on ob- jectives (n=1), study population not in line with our PICO (n=1), the RCT or outcomes reported in the RCT were already reported in the SRs incl uded in our scoping and HTA report (i.e. in Yebyo et al. 201926 or Taylor et al. 20132) (n=4), and post -hoc or subgroup analysis of an RCT already included in the two SRs included in our scoping and HTA report (n=2)2,26.

Of those, 3 ,229 records were excluded based on their title and abstract, resulting in 25 non- randomised studies selected to be screened in full -text, and two non-randomised studies were finally included. The main reasons for exclusion were study population not in line with our PICO (n=9 studies), and treatment duration or follow -up did not fulfil our inclusion criteria (n=7 studies).

The most recent SR of Yebyo et al. 2019 was conducted by the HTA Repo rt 40 University of Z\u00fcrich and searched for existing SRs and individual RCTs that compared statins with a placebo or another statin, which were published until January 2018. The SR of Taylor et al. 2013 is an update review of the Cochrane Collaboration, which searched for scientific literature up to January 2012 on the effects of statins in people with no history of CVD. Yebyo et al. included 40 RCTs, of which 33 RCTs compared statins as a class with placebo and 7 RCTs compared two individual statins.26 In Taylor et al. 18 RCTs comparing statins with placebo or usual care were included.2 These RCTs provided data on the efficacy and safety outcomes; more details on the included RCTs are described in the next section.

RCTs included in the systematic reviews In total 40 RCTs were included in the SR of Yebyo et al. 201926, of which 33 RCTs compar ed statins as a class with plac ebo and 7 RCTs studied the efficacy of two individual statins. These latter RCTs were HTA Repo rt 42 out of scope for this HTA. Taylor et al. 20132 included 18 RCTs comparing statins as a class wi th placebo; 5 of the 18 RCTs were not included in the SR of Yebyo et al. The study characteristics of the RCTs included and as reported in these two SRs are outlined in Table 7.5. Yebyo et al. included two publicati ons on the WOSCOPS trial, we present ed only the baseline data of the most recent publication of the WOSCOPS trial , resulting in a total of 37 RCTs. The RCTs were published between 1997 and 2017 and the sample size ranged from 47 to 17, 802. Most frequently studied statins were pravastatin and atorvas- tatin. The mean age of the study participants ranged from 49 to 69 years and the percentage of males varied from 0 to 100 percent. The overall quality of the RCTs as assessed in the SRs was good in 12 RCTs, fair in 11 RCTs, and poor in 14 RCTs. T he risk of bias is further detailed in Table 7.6. CVD risk groups In the SR s of Yebyo et al. 201926 and Taylor et al. 20132 no stratified results are reported for different CVD risk groups (i.e. Yebyo et al. only conducted a sensitivity analysis in which RCTs with a high propor- tion of diabetes mellitus cases were excluded). Therefore, we checked the individual RCTs for data on CVD risk scores. Only six RCTs reported CVD risk scores for the study population, but three different scoring systems were used and these had no overlap i n the definition of and/or stratification in risk groups (see Table 7.4). The risk scores were mostly used for baseline characteristics of the study population and not for stratification of efficacy or safety outcomes, and therefor e no results were available stratified for people with low, medium, or (very) high CVD risk .

HTA Repo rt 44 Update search for RCTs With our update search for RCTs based on the search strategies of the SRs of Yebyo et al., 2019 and Taylor et al., 2013, no new RCTs were found on statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD events and mortality. Non-randomise d studies In our third search step on long- term outcomes in non- randomised studies, two studies were included that provide add itional data on the effectiveness and safety outcomes.33,34 An overview of the study charac- teristics is included in Table 7.7. Ramos et al. 2018 conducted a retrospective cohort study in Spain with data collected from the database of the Catalan primary care system.33 In 46,864 people aged 75 years or more without clinically recognised atherosclerotic CVD and with and without type 2 diabetes , they as- sessed whether statin treatment was associated with a reduction in atherosclerotic CVD and mortality. Izzo et al. 2013 evaluated the risk of incident diabetes in relation to statin prescription in an Italian cohort study including 4,750 hypertensive non- diabetic outpatients, of which 676 patients used statins.34 Both studies are high quality studies (see Table 7.8).

The SR of Yebyo et al. does not include all predefined outcomes of interest, therefore, besides the Yebyo et al. SR also the SR of Taylor et al. was included. With the inclusion of these two SRs , all predefined outcomes of interest , except life expectancy, are covered. When outcomes were reported in both SRs, only the most up-to-date data reported in the review of Yebyo et al. was extracted. The two non- randomised studies provided additional data on the effective- ness and safety outcomes. Table 7.9.

In Table 7.10 the pooled results and quality of the RCTS reported in these SRs are summarised, including the overall quality of the evidence as assessed with GRADE by Yebyo et al. 2019 (i.e. Taylor et al. 2013 did not apply the GRADE approach to assess t he overall quality of evidence). Sixteen efficacy outcomes on CVD events and mortality showed a risk reduction as a result of statin treatment, however this difference was not significant for three of these outcomes (i.e. fatal stroke events, fatal MI events, and non -fatal heart failure events). For the outcome HRQoL limited data was found and no data was reported on the outcome life expectancy. The efficacy results in the SRs were not stratified for people with low, medium, or (very) high CVD risk . Yebyo e t al. only conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the RCTs with a high proportion of diabetes mellitus cases were excluded. The exclusion of RCTs with a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus cases did not lead to significant differences in the efficacy outcomes. 26 Table 7.10.

HTA Repo rt 53 Figure 5. Overview of the results reported in the systematic reviews of Yebyo, 2019 & Taylor, 2013 Keys: CHD = coronary heart disease, CI = confidence interval, CVD = cardiovascular disease, HDL = high density lipoprotein, LDL = low density lipoprotein, MI = m yocardial infarction, OR = odds ratio, RR = risk ratio, T = Taylor , 2013, Y = Yebyo, 2019. * Based on the data extraction for the economic modelling we noticed that Yebyo, 2019 extracted myalgia data for the outcome myopathy, therefore we reformulated this outcome as myalgia and also extracted the myalgia data from Taylor , 2013; ** This outcome is reported as an odds ratio; OR and RR can be considered similar when the event being assessed is relatively rare in the population. HTA Repo rt 54 All-cause mortality The pooled analysis of Yebyo et al. based on 24 RCTs showed that statins, compared with placebo, significantly reduced the all -cause mortali ty (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.85- 0.93; moderate quality ).26 CVD mortality Yebyo et al. also found a significant reduction in CVD mortality when the statin group was compared with the placebo group (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.71- 0.91; n=15 RCTs 26 Fatal CVD events Five RCTs included in the SR of Taylor et al. reported a significant risk reduction i n fatal CVD events as a result of statin treatment: 17.4% in the statin group versus 20.8% placebo group (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 -0.96; the quality of 4 out of 5 RCTs was good or fair ). 2 Non-fatal CVD events The SR of Yebyo et al. reported a significant reduced risk of major cardiovascular events (i.e. a compo- site outcome of all major cardiovascular events excluding fatal stroke and heart failure) in people at high risk of CVD us ing statins compared with placebo (RR 0.74; 0.67- 0.81; n=23 RCTs ; moderate quality ). 26 Fatal stroke events In the Yebyo review no significant effect was found of stati n treatment on the outcome fatal stroke (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.53- 1.19; n=6 RCTs ; moderate quality ).26 Non-fatal stroke events The risk of non- fatal stroke was significantly reduced by statins compared with placebo in the RCTs included in the SR of Yebyo et al. (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.75- 0.92; n=16 RCTs ; moderate quality ).26 Fatal CHD (not further specifi ed) The pooled analysis of Taylor et al. based on ten RCT s showed that statins resulted in a significant risk reduction in fatal CHD events: 1.1% in the statin group versus 1.3% in the placebo group (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.70 -0.96; the quality of 9 out of 10 RC Ts was good or fair ). 2 Non-fatal CHD (not further specified) The Taylor review found evidence for a significant reduction in non- fatal CHD events in statin users: statin group 0.59- 0.76; n=11 RCTs ; the quality of 10 out of 11 RCTs was good or fair )).2 HTA Repo rt 55 Fatal CHD events: MI No significant effect was found for fatal MI in the SR of Yebyo et al. (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.50- ; low Non-fatal CHD events: MI Based on 16 RCTs included in the SR of Yebyo et al., it was concluded that statins significantly reduced the risk of non- fatal MI in comparison with placebo (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.53- 0.72; moderate quality ).26 Non-fatal CHD events: unstable angina The Yebyo review found evidence for a significant reduction in unstable angina events in statin users compared to placebo (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.63- n=8 RCTs Non-fatal CHD events: heart failure Yebyo et al. did not find a significant effect of statins on non- fatal heart failure events (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71- 1.02; n=5 RCTs ; moderate endpoints: fatal & non -fatal CHD, CVD , and stroke events Four RCTs included in the review of Taylor et al. reported a combined endpoint of fatal and non- fatal events for CHD, CVD , and stroke. The treatment of statins led to a significant reduction in this outcome (2.4% in the statins arm versus 3.8% in the placebo arm; RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.58- 0.73; the quality of 3 out of 4 RCTs was good or fair ).2 Combi ned endpoints: fatal and non -fatal CVD In total, nine RCTs reporting on the combined endpoint fatal and non- fatal CVD events were included in the Taylor review. The pooled analysis showed a significant reduction in this combined outcome in statin users: 9.3% in the statin group versus 12.2% placebo group (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.70- 0.81; the quality of 5 out of 9 RCTs was good or fair ).2 Combined endpoints: fatal and non -fatal CHD events In the SR of Taylor et al. 14 RCTs were included which reported on the combined endpoint of fatal and non-fatal CHD events, resulting in a significant risk reduction caused by statins treatment: 3.4% in the statin group versus 4.6% in placebo gr oup (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.67- 0.80; the quality of 11 out of 14 RCTs was good or fair ).2 Combined endpoints: fatal and non -fatal stroke Ten RCTs reported on combined fatal and non- fatal stroke events in the review of Taylor et al. Two of these RCTs were stopped prematurely , because significant reductions in primary composite outcomes HTA Repo rt 56 between the intervention and placebo had been observed. A significant reduction in th e combined out- come fatal and non- fatal stroke events with the use of statins was found in the pooled analysis: 17% in the statin group versus 22% in the placebo group (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.68- 0.89; the quality of 9 out of 10 RCTs was good or fair ).2 Change in total blood cholesterol concentration The RCTs included in the Taylor review demonstrated significant reductions in total cholesterol concen- trations as an outcome of statins treatment (net difference 95% CI - 1.35 to -0.76 mmol/L; n=14 RCTs ; the quality of 9 out of 14 RCTs was good or fair ). There was marked heterogeneity of effects, but it is likely that the heterogeneity was due to differences in the type of statin and dosage used.2 Change in LDL -C blood cholesterol concentration Statin use resulted in a significant reduction of the LDL cholesterol concentration in 16 RCTs included in the SR of Taylor et al. (net difference -1.00 mmol/L; 95% CI - 1.16 to -0.85 mmol/L; n=16 RCTs ; the quality of 11 out of 16 RCTs was good or fair ). There was marked heterogeneity of effects, but it is likely that this was caused by differences in the type and dosage of statin used. 2 HRQoL Taylor et al. 2013 found limited data on the HRQoL of patients. Only one RCT of poor quality was included that reported data on the quality of life, suggesting that the interv ention of lifestyle advise plus the statin pravastatin reduced stress and sleeping problems.2 Life expectancy In the SRs of Yebyo et al. 201926 and Taylor et al. 20132 no data were reported on the outcome life expectancy . HTA Repo rt 57 7.2.5 Findings effectiveness Both SRs2,26 did not report data on the effectiveness of statins for primary prevention of CVD, because all included studies were RCT s which investigated the treatment under specific study conditions. However, the two additionally included non- randomised studies, of which the retrospective Spanish cohort study of Ramos et al. 2018 reported effectiveness data on the outcomes all -cause mortality, atherosclerotic CVD, stroke, and CHD.33 This cohort study found a significant association between statin use and the effective- ness outcomes in people aged 75- 84 years with type 2 diabetes. The results of this non- randomised study are summarised in Appendix 15. 4. All-cause mortality In people aged 75 years or older without type 2 diabetes statin treatment was not associated with a reduc- tion in all- cause mortality; the hazard ratio (HR) for statin use was 0.98 (95% CI 0.91 -1.05) in year olds (95% CI 0.90 -1.11) in people aged 85+ years.33 In people with type 2 diabetes statin use was associated with a significan t reduction in all -cause mortality, however this effect decreased after the age of 85 years and disappeared in persons aged 90 years or older. The HR for statin use for all -cause mortality was 0.84 (95% CI 0.75- 0.94) in 75- 84 year olds and 1.05 (95% CI 0.86 -1.28) in people atherosclerotic CVD in elderly with a nd without type 2 diabetes is in line with the association found between statins and all -cause mortality. The results show a lack of association between statin treatment and reduction in atherosclerotic CVD events in people aged 75+ years without type 2 di abetes . The HR for statin use was 0.94 (95% CI 0.86- 1.04) in people aged 75- 84 years and 1.00 (95% CI 0.80- 1.24) in 85+ year olds.33 In people aged 75- 84 years with type 2 diabetes , statins significantly reduced the incidence of atherosclerotic CVD by 24%, however no significant benefits were observed in people aged 85 years or older. The HRs for both groups were respectively 0.76 (95% fatal and non -fatal stroke The results for the combined endpoint fatal and non- fatal stroke are in line with the abo ve described effect of statin treatment in older people. A significant association between statin use and stroke was only reported for people aged 75- 84 years with type 2 diabetes (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66- 0.99). 33 HTA Repo rt 58 Combined endpoints: CHD (fatal /non-fatal angina, fatal /non-fatal MI, or cardiac revascularisation) Ramos et al. also reported comparable results for the outcome CHD, which is a composite of fatal and non- fatal angina, fatal and non-fatal MI, or cardiac revascularisation. Statin use was only associated with a significant reduction in CHD for people aged 75- 84 years with type 2 diabetes (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60- 0.94).33 7.2.6 Findings safety The safety results of the two included SRs are summarised in Figure 5. In Table 7.11 the pooled results and quality of the RCTS reported in the se SRs are summarised, including the overall quality of the evidence as assessed with GRADE by Yebyo et al. 2019 (i.e. Taylor et al. 2013 did not apply the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence). For t wo of the nine reported adverse events statin us e resulted in a significant increase in adverse events (i.e. hepatic dysfunction and renal dysfunction) . For the adverse event myalgia Yebyo et al. found a significant increase, however the analyses of Taylor et al. did not find a significant association. N o significant difference between the statins and placebo group was found for the other six adverse events. Furthermore, the use of statins led to a significant reduction of revascularisation rates and no significant differences were reported for the outcomes treatment discontinuation and compli- ance to statin medication. The safet y results in the SRs were not stratified for people with low, medium, or (very) high CVD risk . Yebyo et al. only conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the data with a high pro- portion of diabetes mellitus cases were excluded. The exclusion of RCTs with a higher proportion of diabe- tes mellitus cases did not lead to significant differences in the safety outcomes.26 The outcomes of the two included non-randomised studies on primary prevention in CVD are reported in Appendix 15. 4 and are mostly in line with the results of Yebyo et al. and Taylor et al.

HTA Repo rt 60 Treatment -associated adverse events Yebyo et al. 2019 concluded that t he use of statins in comparison with placebo led to a significant increase of hepatic dysfunction (RR 1.16; 95% CI 1.02- 1.31; n=12 95% CI 1.00- 1.26; n=4 RCTs ; moderate quality ).26 It is important to keep in mind that these outcomes were not always clearly and homogeneously defined and few RCTs used both clinical features and serum biomarkers to define dysfunction.26 Statin use was not associated with an increased risk of liver toxicity in the Spanish retrospective cohort study of people aged 75 years or older.33 In the meta- analysis of Yebyo et al. no significant differences between the statin group and the placebo group were found for the adverse events type 2 diabetes (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.91- 1.19; n=6 RCTs CI 0.93- 1.09; n=9 RCTs ; 1.13; 95% CI 0.97- 1.31; n=5 RCTs ; low quality ).26 For type 2 diabetes similar results were reported in the two included non- randomised studies.33,34 Ramos et al. also did not find an increased risk of cancer asso- ciated with statin use in people aged 75+ years.33 Based on the data extraction for the economic modelling we noticed that Yebyo et al. 2019 extracted my- algia data for the outcome which they defined as myopathy . We therefore reformulated this outcome as myalgia and also extracted t he myalgia data from Taylor et al. 2013 . Yebyo et al.26 reported that statins as a class showed a statistically significant increase of myalgia (RR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01- 1.15; n=16 RCTs; moderate quality), while Taylor et al.2 did not find a significant association between statin use and the occurrence of myalgia (RR 1.03; 95% 0.97- 1.09; n=9 RCTs ; the quality of 8 out of 9 RCTs was good or fair). Data on the adverse event myopath y was reported only in the Spanish retrospective cohort study; the incidence rate was low ranging from 0.2- 1.1 events per 1000 person- years and statin use was not associated with an increased risk of myopathy.33 Furthermore, Taylor et al . did not find evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription for three other treatment -associated adverse events: the very rare event rhabdomyolysis (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.23 - 4.38; n=6 RCTs ; the quality of 5 out of 6 RCTs was good or fair ), CI 0.54- 1.75; n=2 ; the quality of 1 out of 2 RCTs was good or fair ), and arthritis (OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.82- 1.75; n=2 RCTs ; the quality of 2 out of 2 RCTs was good or fair ).2 The results of Ramos et al. were in line with this and also showed no increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke associated with statin use.33 HTA Repo rt 61 Revascularisation Seven RCTs included in the meta- analysis of Taylor et al. 2013 reported on the need for revascularisation procedures during follow -up: 1.4% in the statin group versus 2.2% in the placebo group underwent either percutaneous trans luminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The use of statins resulted in a significant reduction of revascularisation rates compared with the control group (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.54- 0.72; the quality of 6 out of 7 RCTs was goo d or fair ).2 Treatment discontinuation Treatment discontinuation events did not significantly differ between the statin and placebo group in the review of Yebyo et al. (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.78- 1.24; 18 RCTs ; very low quality ). 26 Compliance to statin medication No significant difference between the statin use and placebo was reported for the outcome treatment com- pliance in the Taylor review. In the statin group 77% of the participants and in the placebo group 70% of the participants complied with the treatment (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.98- 1.18; n=8 RCTs ; the quality of 7 out of 8 RCTs was good or fair ). 2 Adherence to statin medication In the SRs of Yebyo et al. 201926 and Taylor et al. 20132 no data were reported on the outcome treatment adherence. Summary statement efficacy, effectiveness , and safety In the clinical review two high quality SRs with relevant data of 3 7 RCTs were included o n the effi- cacy and safety of statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in adults . Two high quality non - randomised studies provided additional data on effectiveness and safety. No studies were found on the efficacy of lifestyle adaptations (in combinatio n with statin therapy) for primary prevention of CVD in adults. Based on the evidence for the efficacy outcomes it can be concluded that statin therapy prescribed for adults without established CVD is effective in the prevention of cardiovascular events an d mor- tality. The available data from non -randomised studies is too scarce to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of statins. In most studies, treatment with statins did not result in an increased risk HTA Repo rt 62 of adverse event s. Statin use only resulted in a sign ificant risk increase for hepatic dysfunction (low quality of evidence) and renal dysfunction (moderate quality of evidence ). However, there are limi- tations with regard to the definitions of these outcomes in the RCTs. T he available evidence for the adverse event myalgia was inconsistent. Risk scores for CVD were hardly reported in the studies and therefore no stratification of the effi- cacy, effectiveness, or safety results was available for people with low, medium, or (very) high CVD risk. HTA Repo rt 63 8 Costs, cost -effectiveness, and population -level costs 8.1 Methodology costs, cost -effectiveness, and population -level costs A systematic literature search was conducted to identify cost -effectiveness studies on primary prevention of CVD with statin therapy. In addit ion, a de novo cost -effectiveness model was developed to calculate the cost-effectiveness and population- level costs of statin therapy for the Swiss context specifically. In this chapter, the employed methods are further detailed starting with the systemat ic literature search (Chapters 8.1.1 - 8.1.3), followed by a description of the conceptual cost -effectiveness model , additional searches for model inputs , and cost -effectiveness and population- level cost analyses (Chapter 8.1.4) 8.1.1 Databases search strategy PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase.com, and NHS EED databases were searched for peer -reviewed scientific literature. The PICO method was used to specify the research questions. Table 5.1 outlines the utilised PICO for the cost-effectiveness systematic review. Based on expert opinion, a review period of 10 years (2009- 2019) was adopted. The most important reason for limiting the search to this time period was be- cause it was expected that recent studies included more mature data due to longer follow -up and would therefore be deemed of higher quality. However, even within this relatively recent time period, it is important to be aware of recent changes in statin prices and the influence of inflation and discount rates on the cost - effectiveness outcomes. Publications in German, English, French, and Dutch were included. The search terms for the population and intervention of the efficacy , effectiveness, and safety literature search were combined with search terms for economic studies to find economic evaluations. The search terms for economic evaluations were developed together with an information specialist of the Erasmus University Medical Centre and validated extensively with other search terms for economic evaluations and previous SRs of the cost -effectiveness of primary prevention of CVD with statins. The search for economic evaluations of primary prevention of CVD with statins was executed on 11 July 2019. The literature database output, including all indexed fields per record (e.g. title, authors, and abstract) was exported to Endnote version X7.8. Duplicates in Endnote were automatically removed and further manually deleted. Inclusion and exclusion criteria The list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is presented in Table 8.1.

The first 30% of titles and abstracts from the peer -reviewed literature were screened in duplicate by two independent researchers from iMTA. The results were compared and discussed before the remaining references were assessed by one researcher. During screening there was more than HTA Repo rt 65 5% discrepancy between the two researchers, therefore all titles and abstracts were screened in duplicate. Any conflicts were discussed and amended accordingly. The first 10% of the full -text art icles from the peer -reviewed literature were assessed for relevancy and critically appraised in duplicate by two independent researchers from iMTA. Again, during screening there was more than 5% discrepancy between the two researchers, therefore all full -text articles were screened in duplicate. Any conflicts were discussed and amended accordingly. 8.1.2 Other s ources Hand search of reference lists SRs During the full -text screening phase of the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety review and the cost-effective- ness review , reference lists of SRs were checked to find any other studies or SRs that were not captured with our systematic literature search. HTA websites Clinical guidelines and technology assessments from the major national HTA agency websites from coun- tries other than Switzerland (e.g. EUnetHTA for Europeg, NICEh from the United Kingdom ( UK), IQWIGi from Germany, HASj from France, ZiNk from the Netherlands, CADTHl from Canada, and PBACm from Australia) were searched for documents addressing primary prev ention of CVD with statin therapy (i.e. search terms 'statins' in relevant language) . This search aimed to check if the published cost -effectiveness studies and guidelines (see other HTA domains) possibly missed relevant evidence on the efficacy, safety, and economic aspects. In addition, these documents provide insight in the stances of other EU HTA agen- cies on the primary prevention of statins. The initial search yielded the NICE clinical guideline on CVD n and g www.eunethta.eu/ h www.nice.org.uk i www.pbs.gov.au/ n https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg181 Repo rt 66 three SRs on the CADTH webpage.o,p,q No misse d studies/articles were identified in these guidelines/re- views. 8.1.3 Assessment of quality of evidence The Consensus Health Economics Checklist (CHEC) checklist was used for the appraisal of the methodo- logical quality of the economic evaluations. The CHEC was preferred over the Drummond checklist, be- cause of the decreasing use of the Drummond checklist in the field74 and the experienced feasi bility of completing the checklists. The CHEC is one of the two most often used checklists in recent studies, the other checklist is CHEERS.74 The CHEC was chosen over the CHEERS checklist as the CHEC can be used to assess the methodological quality of economic evaluations, while the CHEERS checklist was pri- marily intended for use as a reporting checklist. The CHEC is a 19- item checklis t75 with clear questions about the economic evaluation that will give us insight into the general quality of the study for a preliminar y critical appraisal of the quality of the included studies. In addition to the CHEC, it was assessed whether statin- specific outcomes were included in the economic evaluations (e.g. treatment adherence and disutility for taking pills every day). 8.1.4 Descript ion of health economic model Considering the lack of high- quality cost -effectiveness studies in the Swiss context, lack of cost -effective- ness studies using one of the preferred risk scoring systems in Switzerland, and recent changes in prices of statins due to the introduction of generics, a de novo model was developed that incorporated the most recent and (where possible) Switzerland- specific effectiveness, costs, and utility 67 Model structure A de novo Markov model has been developed to compare t he cost -effectiveness of statin therapy for pri- mary prevention of CVD with no statin therapy in adults without established CVD and with low, medium, and (very) high CVD risk . Although the published cost-effectiveness studies did not provide sufficient infor- mation to draw firm conclusions on the cost -effectiveness of statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in Switzerland, the model structures and findings of the published studies were used as a starting point for the development of the cost -effectivenes s model . All studies identified in the cost -effectiveness systematic literature search considered the impact of statins on the occurrence of myocardial infarction and almost every study considered the occurrence of ischemic strokes. The identified systema tic reviews of Yebyo et al.26 and Taylor et al.2 reported the following CVD events: MI, stroke, unstable angina and heart failure. In addition, the occurrences of unstable angina and coronary revascularisations were often considered. The inclusion of these CVD events in our de novo cost - effectivene ss model was discussed with a clinical expert, who advi sed to include MI, and stroke as the main CVD events. According to t he clinical expert unstable angina would be difficult to consider in the economic model because the distinction between unstable angina and MI has changed over time. Therefore, it is possi ble that studies used different definitions for unstable angina, making it hard to compare study out- comes. Based on the information above and discussion with the FOPH, we included non-fatal MI and non- fatal stroke as CVD events. In addition, all fatal CVD events (including events other than MI and stroke) were taken into account in CVD death. Other non- CVD events resulting in death were included in the 'No CVD death' state. The conceptual model is presented in Figure 6. The model had a cycle length of 1 year and a lifetime time horizon. The model start ed with patients without CVD who start statin therapy (intervention arm) or not (comparator arm) and are at risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) , non- fatal stroke, fatal CVD eve nts (including but not limited to fatal MI and stroke) , and non-CVD related mortality. Adverse events of statin therapy were not included in the base- case analysis. As the focus of this cost -effectiveness analysis was the use of statins in primary preventi on of CVD , the patient's course after the first non- fatal CVD event was not modelled in detail . Instead, the consequences of secondary CVD events were taken into account in the post-CVD event health states (i.e. post MI and post stroke Figure 6), which were associated with an in- creased mortality risk , costs, and disutility seen amongst post -MI and post -stroke patients. HTA Repo rt 68 Figure 6. Conceptual model As requested by the FOPH, t he analys es were performed from a healthcare payer perspective (i.e. including all direct medical costs ). Costs were reported in Swiss franc (CHF) and adjusted for inflation to 2019 prices using inflation rates from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, accessed from the OECD websiter. Health outcomes were reported in life years (LYs) and quality -adjusted life years (QALYs). In the base- case anal- ysis, costs and effects were discounted with a discount factor of 3% . The model was programmed in R 3. 6.1 using RStudio 1. 2.1335 and was based on the state- transition model framework developed by the Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) workgroup.76-78 r https://data.oecd.org/ HTA Repo rt 69 8.1.5 Model inputs Transition probabilities The transition probabilities of the CVD events included in the model were based on the predefined AGLA risk score . The baseline AGLA risk score was chosen at the start of the model. To estimate the cost -effec- tiveness of statins in different subgroups with varying CVD risk, the following baseline AGLA risk scores were included: (low), (high) , and 25% (very high). In the following years, the AGLA risk score increased due to advancing age. The sex -specific increase in risk due to age was derived from the AGLA risk calculator.79 In the base- case analysis, it was assumed that other risk factors included in the AGLA risk calculator (i.e. systolic blood pressure, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, smok- ing status, diabetes mellitus, family history of MI) would remain constant over time. The AGLA risk score represents the 10- year composite probability of a 'major coronary event', defined as occurrence of sudden cardiac death or a definite fatal or non- fatal MI on the basis of ECG and/or cardiac enzyme changes .13,79 The definition of a sudden cardiac death was death of a previously apparently well person within one hour of onset of symptoms, providing the cause of death could not be attributed to vio- lence, trauma, or some other potentially lethal condition other than coronary heart disease (CHD).80 CHD is a synonym for ischemic heart disease or coronary artery disease.81 According to our conceptual model (Figure 6), non- fatal strokes and deaths due to stroke or other cardiovascular diseases should also be included in the health economic model, in addition to the non- fatal MI and CHD deaths included in the AGLA risk score. Therefore, the relative proportion of non- fatal MI and CHD related deaths was used to disentan- gle the AGLA risk score into the individual probabilities of non-fatal MI and CHD related death . Subse- quently, the relative proportion of non- fatal MI and non -fatal stroke was us ed to determine the probability of non- fatal stroke corresponding to the AGLA risk score (see the calculation example in Box 1 ). In addition, the proportion of CHD -related death of all CVD deaths (35%, Table 8.2) was used to determ ine the total probability of CVD deaths corresponding to the AGLA risk score (see the calculation example in Box 1) . The relative proportion of ' non-fatal MI and CHD deaths ' and 'non-fatal MI and non- fatal stroke' was calcu- lated by pooling the incidence r ates of these events in the no treatment/ placebo arms of the trials included in the systematic review of Yebyo et al .(Table 8.3)26 These pooled inci dences of MI, stroke and CVD death were estimated in a random -effects meta- analysis using inverse variance weighting based on the number of follow -up patient -years using the 'meta' package in R.82 In case the number of follow -up patient -years was not reported, the mean or median follow -up duration or trial duration was multiplied by the sample size to derive the total number of patie nt-years. As the reported trial duration is generally longer than the mean HTA Repo rt 70 follow -up duration in a trial, the reported trial duration was adjusted using the proportion of the mean/median follow -up duration of the total trial duration in studies that report ed both study characteristics. On average the mean/median follow -up duration was 82% of the total trial duration. Based on this analysis , the relative proportion of MI vs. CVD death was 0.559 and the relative proportion of stroke vs. MI was 1.0 22. The inc idence of CHD death was not available in the systematic review of Yebyo et al. Therefore, the incidence of CVD death of 0.559 was adjusted to the incidence of CHD deaths by dividing it by the propor- tion of CHD deaths of CVD deaths derived from Eurostat dat a for Switzerland in 2017 (Table 8.2).83 For CHD deaths we used the number of deaths caused by ischa emic heart diseases (acute MI and other is- cheamic heart diseases) and for other CVD deaths we used the number of deaths caused by other heart diseases, cerebrovascular disease (i.e. including stroke) and other diseases of the circulatory system (Ta- ble 8.2). 83 This resulted in a proportion of CHD of CVD deaths of 0.35, i.e. 35% of the CVD deaths were caus ed by CHD (Table 8.2).83 Table 8.2 Standardised death rates in Switzerland in 2017 - diseases of the circulatory system, source: Eurostat83 Diseases of the circulatory system Number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants Proportion of total deaths Ischemic heart disease (including MI)* 191 35% Other heart disease 144 27% Cerebrovascular disease (including stroke) 88 16% Other disease of the circulatory system 118 22% *Included in the AGLA risk score. The AGLA risk score provides the 10- year probability on non- fatal MI or CHD death. Therefore, the proba- bilities o f CVD events derived from the AGLA risk score were converted to annual probabilities of the indi- vidual CVD events for inc lusion in the annual cycles of the model. To convert the resulting 10-year proba- bilities to annual probabilities , the 10- year probabilities were transformed to rates with the following formula where r is rate and p is probability: =(1). Then the rates were divided by 10 to determine the annual rates. Finally, the annual rates were transformed back to probabilities using the following formula: =1() (see the calculation example Box 1 ). HTA Repo rt 71 Box 1: Example calculation annual probabilities of CVD events per CVD risk subgroup AGLA risk score : 10% (predefined in subgroup definition) Incidence of non- fatal MI: 8 .5 events per 1000 person- years (Yebyo et al.3) Incidence of CVD death: 6 .7 events per 1000 person- years (Yeb yo et al.3) Incidence of non- fatal stroke: 8 .7 events per 1000 person- years et al.3) Proportion CHD of CVD death: 35% (EuroStat83) Calculation of incidence of CHD deaths Incidence of CHD deaths = i ncidence of CVD death * proportion CHD of CVD death = 6.7 / 0. 35 = 2.2 events per 1000 person- years Calculation of individual probabilities of non- fatal MI, non- fatal stroke and CVD deaths 1. 10-year probability of non -fatal MI in the 10% AGLA risk score group = AGLA risk score * (incidence non- fatal MI/(incidence non- fatal MI + CHD death)) = 10 * ( 8.5 / (8.5+2.2) = 7.8% 2. 10-year probability of CHD death in the 10% AGLA risk score group = AGLA risk score * (incidence C HD death/(incidence non- fatal MI + CHD death)) = 10 * ( 2.2 / (8.5+2.2) = 2.2% 10-year probability of CVD death in the 10% AGLA risk score group = 10-year probability of CHD death / proportion CHD of CVD death = 2. 2 / 0.35 = 6.2% 3. 10-year probability of stroke in the 10% AGLA risk score group = Non- fatal MI risk (defined in 1) * (incidence non- fatal stroke/non- fatal MI) = 7.8 * (8.7 / 8.5) = 8.0% Calculation of annual probabilities from 10- year probabilities The 10- year MI risk correspond to the following annual probability : 1. 10-year non- fatal MI rate = - log (1- 0.076) = 0.0812 2. Annual non- fatal MI rate = 0. 0812 / 10 = 0. 00812 3. Annual non -fatal MI probability = 1 - e (-0.00 812 * 1) = 0.00809 In the same way the annual probabilities on CVD death and non- fatal stroke can be calculated. The effect of statin treatment was modelled by multiplying the annual probabilities of CVD events with the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of statin versus no stati n.(Table 8.3) The relative risks (RR) reported in Yebyo et al. were not used in our model as the outcomes of individual studies were weighted by sample size instead of total number of person- years in their meta- analysis . To consider differences in follow -up durat ion be- tween the trials, a random -effects meta- analysis using inverse variance weighting based on the number of follow -up patient -years was performed using the 'meta' package in R .82 The mean number of follow -up patient -years was determined in the same way as described before in the meta- analysis of incidence of CVD events in no treatment/placebo arms of the trials included in Yebyo et al. HTA Repo rt 72 The relative proportions of non- fatal MI and CVD death and non- fatal MI and stroke and the RRs of CVD events of statin therapy versus no statin therapy were assumed to be equal across CVD risk groups. Table 8.3. Outcomes random -effect meta- analys es of incidence rates without statin therapy and IRR statins therapy vs. no statins for non -fatal MI, non -fatal stroke, and CVD death. Incidence year without 0.0079 Note: The incidence rates in this t able are only used to determine the relative proportion of CVD events that is used in the translation of AGLA risk scores to probabilities of CVD events (see example calculation in Box 1) Background mortality was based on the all-cause mortality rates derived from Swiss lifetabless adjusted for age and sex adjusted proportions of CVD deaths84 to avoid double counting of CVD deaths. After a non- fatal MI or stroke, patients have an increased mortality risk mainly due to CVD .85,86 Therefore, the CVD death rates after non- fatal MI or stroke in the model were multiplied with the standard mortality rates (SMR) reported in studies of Bronnum -Hansen et al . and converted to probabilities ( Table 8.4).85,86 Bronnum -Hansen et al. found a significantly higher SMR in the first year after a non- fatal MI or stroke compared to subsequent years. In subsequent years, the SMR decreased over time but the differences between the time periods were not significant. Therefore, the SMR for the subsequent years in the model was based on the average of SMRs reported for 1- 5 years, 5- 10 years, and 10- 15 years after stroke. s https://www.mortality.org/ HTA Repo rt 73 Table 8.4.

However, in the real -world patients are not fully adherent to statin therapy. Therefore, non- adherence was considered in the base- case analysis of the cost -effectiveness model. was assumed that non- adherence only reduced costs of statin drugs, but not the costs of follow -up and monitoring. In addit ion, it was assumed that statins would have no effect on CVD risks if treatment adherence was below 20% and would have full effect if treatment adherence was above 80%. A linear reduction in treatment effect was assumed if treat-ment adherence was between 2 0% and 80% by increasing the IRR of CVD events when treatment adher- ence decreased. Real -world treatment adherence was based on a register -based study of statin adherence in Finland 87 who found 69% adherence in the first year of statin therapy and 60% in subsequent years. The impact of full adherence is explored in a scenario analysis. Table 8.5 provides the resulting IRRs for the varying rates of adherence.

The search terms, meth- ods, and resu lts of this systematic literature search are provided in Appendix 15.7. The values of the costs, and resource use were only extracted from the studies that were considered most relevant to inform the input parameters of the cost -effectiveness model. For s ome of these inputs, other sources were also used such as public databases with specific data for Switzerland. The following costs and resource use inputs were deemed relevant, and are discussed in further detail below : Annual statin drugs acquisition cost s. Annual costs of monitoring and follow -up of patients using statins . Costs of treatment of patients with non- fatal CV events . Costs of follow -up of patients with non- fatal CV events . Costs of CVD related and non- CVD related deaths (including treatment costs and additional costs associated with the last period before death due to e.g. palliative care) . Costs of treatment of AE of statins (only in scenario analysis). Annual statin drugs acquisition costs Annual statin drugs acquisition costs were calculated by multiplying the per pill drug acquisition costs 365.25 days. Per pill drug acquisition costs were calculated from the annual receipts submitted for reim- bursement by the Swiss statutory health insurance for all types of statins available in Switzerland, obtained from: COGE \u00a9, Tarifpool \u00a9SASIS AG .88 These sales data were not disaggregated according to primary or secondary prevention. Therefore, we assume that overall sales pattern would represent the primary pre- vention sales pattern for statins. For each formulation (i.e. in ter ms of the active substance and dosage) and for each brand, the package size (in terms of pill number), annual sales data in terms of CHF and number of packages (2019 ) were available from Tarifpool: \u00a9 SASIS AG .88 HTA Repo rt 75 From these detailed level data for each formulation/brand combination, formulation- specific per pill drug acquisition costs and market shares were calculated. Afterwards, overall per pil l drug acquisition costs were calculated by taking the weighted average of formulation- specific costs according to their market shares. The formulae used in the calculation of the per pill drug acquisition costs, which were applied to each medication type, are provided in the box below. This calculation resulted in a per pill price of 0.72 CHF, resulting in annual drug costs of 266.30 CHF per patient per year. i = formulation i, j = brand j # tablets sold (i,j) = sales in packages (i,j)*package size (i,j) per pill price (i,j) = sales in CHF(i,j) /# tablets sold (i,j) # tablets sold (i) = # tablets sold (i,j) # sales in CHF(i) = sales in CHF (i,j) market share ( i, j) = tablets sold ( i, j)/ tablets sold (i,j) per pill price = per pill price (,j)market share (,j) Annual costs of monitoring and follow -up of patients with statins The costs of GP visits were derived from TARMEDt and the costs for lipid profile tests w ere derived from Eidgen\u00f6ssische Analysenlisteu.The resource use was based on expert opinion from a Swiss GP. It was assumed that statin therapy was initiated after consultation with a GP. There are two possible tests to determine whether patients require statin therapy and to control the effect of statin therapy: a direct measurement in the GP practice or a lipid profile test at a laboratory. For both options, the total costs of initiation of statin therapy and follow -up are provided in Table 8.6. In the base- case analysis, it was assumed that 50% of the patients would be prescribed statins based on the direct measurement at the GP practice t https://www.tarmed -browser.ch/de u https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/versicherungen/ krankenversicherung/krankenversicherung-leistungen-ta- rife/Analysenliste.html HTA Repo rt 76 and 50% based on the results of the laboratory analysis (i.e. average of the second and third column in Table 8.6). This assumption was varied in sensitivity analyses. If patients were prescribed statins based on the direct measurement at the GP practice during the initial visit, we assumed statins would be prescribed during this initial visit. If patients were prescribed statins bas ed on the results of the lipid profile analysis performed at the labora- tory, patients would receive the statin prescriptions after the test results are evaluated. Therefore, additional costs of another GP visit or only a prescription for statins were included (base- case assumption 50%/50%). In both scenarios, it was assumed that patients had a follow -up visit and test to control the effect of statins six weeks later and an annual follow -up visit at the GP. In subsequent years, it was assumed that patients had an annual follow -up visit at the GP. The total costs of both scenarios are outlined in Table 8.6. Table 8.6.

Their cost estimates include all follow -up costs of an event in the first year and in each subsequent year, respectively. The follow -up costs include inpatient and outpatient costs for acute care and rehabilita- tion. Costs of CVD related and non- CVD related death The healthcare costs associated with a CVD death were derived from Pletscher et al. who reported the costs of several fatal CVD events, including stroke ( CHF 9,799) and MI (CHF 7,207).90 A weighted average of these healthcare costs based on the proportion of MI and stroke observed in placebo arm s of trials on statins was used as a proxy for healthcare costs of all CVD deaths (CHF 8,511). The healthcare costs associated with a non-CVD related death were derived from Br\u00e4ndle et al. who re- ported costs of all -cause mortality (CHF 4,191).91 Adverse event costs In the scenario analy sis including adverse events, i n line with De Vries et al.92, costs of myopathy were assumed to include two GP visits. It was assumed that the costs of each of these GP vi sits were equal to the costs of the first follow -up visit (127.06 CHF). Costs of rhabdomyolysis were derived from the costs of treatment of rhabdomyolysis in a United States ( US) cost study converted to CHF.93 No relevant cost esti- mates could be determined for the treatment of renal and hepatic dysfunction, because these events were not alwa ys clearly and homogeneously defined in the clinical trials and therefore it was unclear how patients were generally treated for these adverse events.

Utility inpu ts To identify the most recent Swiss utility data available to use as input in the cost -effectiveness model , a comprehensive search for baseline utilities for patients without cardiovascular events, disutil ities associated with CVD events, disutil ities for long-term post -CVD events, disutilities associated with adverse events, and disutility of statin use (i.e. 'taking a pill every day') in Swiss patients was performed. The search terms, methods, and results of this systematic literature search are provided in Appendix 15.8. The following utilities were included in the model: baseline utilities for patients without CVD events associated with CVD events . disutil ities associated with adverse events (only included in scenario analysis) . Baselin e utilities for patients without CVD events The utility values in patients without CVD events were based on the study of Perneger et al. (2010) who conducted a mail survey in French- speaking Switzerland which included the EQ -5D instrument and de- scriptive v ariables.94 Perneger et al. estimated a linear regression model where EQ-5D utility was predicted by age and sex : 0.84822 - 0.00208 * (age - 50) - 0.00002 * (age - 50)2 - 0.02090 if female. This formula was used to calculate age and sex specific utility values. Disutili ties associated with CVD events The utility decrements for non- fatal CVD events were derived from Nikolic et al . who reported a utility dec- rement of - 0.138 after stroke and - 0.063 after MI.95 In the base- case analysis, it was assumed that the disutility of experiencing a stroke remains constant during the rest of the patient's lifetime, based o n a study of Rivero- Arias et al. where no substantial im- provement in utility was observed two years after stroke.96 In contrast, it was assumed that the disutility of MI would only be applicable in the first year after MI , because Reed et al. showed that the utility of patients after MI recovered to (at least) the utility of the ge neral population after one year .97 Disutili ties associated with adverse events HTA Repo rt 80 Disutili ties of adverse events were not identified in our literature search. Therefore, in line with the approach of Slejko et al.98, the disutil ities of adverse events were derived from a US catalog of EQ -5D scores for chronic conditions by CCC or ICD- 9 code.99 For hepatic dysfunction, the disutility of liver failure (ICD -9 573; 0.0567) was used. For renal of renal failure (ICD -9 586; 0.0603) was used. In line with Slejko et al., this disutility was also used for rhabdomyolysis. For myopathy, the utility for connective tissue diseases was used (ICD -9 710 ; 0.0235) based on clinical judgment of the similarity of these health states reported by Slejko et al . The disutilities of adverse events were applied for one cycle. Population and reimbursement p olicy related inputs for population -level cost analysis The number of people in every 1- year age group in Switzerland in 2019 was derived from the Human Mortality Database.100 In the Swiss population- based study of Nanchen et al. (2009)101, 6.4% of the popu- lation diagnosis of angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral ar- terial disease, or history of coronary revasculari sation). This means that 93.6% of the population is eligible for primary prevention of CVD with statin therapy. The distribution of the CVD risk in the Swiss population without CVD was based on the popul ation in the Olten area reported in Romanens et (89% low, 10% intermediate, and 2% high CVD risk).14 As these numbers add up to 101% instead of 100% , the percentage of patients in the largest CVD risk group (i.e. low risk) was reduced from 89% to 88% to avoid calculating annual healthcare costs for too many people. 8.1.6 Analytical methods Base- case analysis The base- case analysis was conducted using the settings for the input parameters and assumptions as described in the previous sections. This implies that the cost -effectiveness model is run using a lifetime time horizon, real -world adherence and discounting of costs and effects with a discount factor of 3% . Ad- verse events were not included in the base- case analysis , because there was no clear evidence of in- creased risk on the four selected adverse events: myopathy, rhabdomyol ysis, renal and hepatic dysfunc- tion. Discontinuation due to adverse events was not included in the base- case analysis , because it was assumed based on expert opinion that patients would switch to another type of statin when the y experi- enced an adverse event. In addition, no disutility of 'taking a pill every day' was assumed. These assump- tions were varied in scenario analyses. HTA Repo rt 81 The base- case analysis was performed for 96 subgroups with varying age, sex, and AGLA risk score ( Table 8.8). Table 8.8. Subgroups Age Sex AGLA risk score 40 Male 1% (Low) 45 Female 5% (Low) 50 10% (Medium) 55 15% (Medium) 60 20% (High) 65 25% (Very high) 70 75 To show the impact of changing the assumptions and parameter uncertainty on the cost -effectiveness re- sults, scenario and sensitivity analyses were performed. These analyses were performed for 1 of the 96 subgroups (50- year old males with AGLA ris k of 1%), but the direction and magnitude of the impact is expected to be similar in other subgroups. The subgroup of 50- year old males with AGLA risk of 1% was chosen because this is a large subgroup that may have a large impact on total costs of statin t herapy . Scenario analyses Several scenario analyses were performed to explore the impact of structural assumptions on the cost - effectiveness outcomes. An overview of the scenario analyses is provided in Table 8.9 and the scenarios are discussed in more detail below. Table 8.9. Description of base -case and scenario analyses Base -case analysis Scenario analysis Time horizon Lifetime 10 years Discount rate 3% discount rate for costs and outcomes No discounting 6% discount rate for costs and out- comes Increase in CVD risk Increase in AGLA risk due to ageing Increase in AGLA risk due to ageing combined with additional increase in risk due to other risk factors included HTA Repo rt 82 in the AGLA risk cal culator (i.e. sys- tolic blood pressure, LDL, HDL, tri- glycerides, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, family history of MI) Duration disutility of MI 1 year Lifetime Duration disutility of stroke Lifetime 1 year Adverse events Not included Myopathy, rhab domyolysis, hepatic and renal dysfunction Discontinuation of statin therapy due to adverse events Not included Constant annual discontinuation rate for the entire time horizon of the model; Constant annual discontinuation rate for three years ( i.e. mean trial duration); Linear decreasing annual discon-tinuation rate; Exponentially decreasing annual discontinuation rate. Statin therapy adherence Real-world adherence (69% in year 1, 60% in sub-sequent years) Full adherence Effectiveness of statins in patien ts above 75 years old Equal to younger patients Reduced effectiveness in patients above 75 years old Disutility of taking a pill Not included Utility decrement of statin therapy of 0.001 Time horizon A scenario analysis with a time horizon of 10 years instead of lifetime was performed to be able to compare results with previous studies that often had a time horizon of 10 years , because the risk scoring system provided CVD risk for the next 10 years. Discounting In the base- case analysis, discounting costs and effects with a discount factor of 3% was applied as re- quested by the FOPH . The impact of no discounting and discounting cost and effects with a discount factor of 6% was assessed in scenario analyses. Additional increase in CVD risk over time due to other risk factors than age In the base- case analysis, CVD risk increases over time based on ageing. However, other risk factors of CVD events included in the AGLA risk calculator (i.e. systolic blood pressure, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, family history of MI) may also change over time causing a higher increase in CVD risk than modelled in the base- case analysis. In this scenario analysis, the impact of this additional HTA Repo rt 83 increase in risk over time is explored by increasing the A GLA risk scores every year from cycle 2 onwards with a certain percentage varying between 1% and 20%. Duration of disutility of MI and stroke In the base- case analysis, it was assumed that MI only had impact on utility of patients during the first year after MI based on findings in the literature. T o explore the impact of a longer duration of disutility after MI, a scenario analysis with lifetime disutility of MI was performed. In contrast to MI, the impact of stroke on utility seems to be longer and theref ore a lifetime disutility was applied in the base- case analysis. The impact of this assumption was also explored in a scenario analysis by only applying the disutility of stroke during the first year after stroke. Adverse events In this scenario analysis, patients in both treatment arms could experience adverse events, including myo- pathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatic and renal dysfunction. Adverse events were associated with treatment costs and disutilities. The effect of statin treatment was modelled by multipl ying the annual probabilit y of each adverse event with the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of statin versus no stati n of that specific adverse event . Just as the pooled incidences and IRR of CVD events, the pooled incidences and IRR of events were estim ated in random -effects meta- analys es using inverse variance weighting based on the number of follow -up patient -years using the 'meta' package in R. 82 The meta- analyses results are presented in Table 8.10. No relevant cost estimates could be determined for the treatment of renal and hepatic dysfunction, because these events were not always cle arly and homogeneously defined in the clinical trials and therefore it was unclear how patients were generally treated for these adverse events. The costs of these events were therefore not included in this scenario analysis, but sensitivity analyses where these costs varied over a large range (from 0 to 100,000 CHF) were performed to show the impact of this parameter on the cost - effectiveness results.

After discontinuation, the probabilities of non- fatal MI, non- fatal stroke, or fatal CVD events in these patients were equal to the prob- abilities in the no treatment arm and patients did not have any statin therapy costs. Several statin discontinuation scenario analyses were performed: Constant annual discontinuation rate for the entire time horizon of the model . Constant annual discontinuation rate for three years (mean trial duration) . Linear decreasing annual discontinuation rate . Exponentially decreasing annual discontinuation rate. The probability of discontinuation was derived from the pooled estimate of the treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events in the statin arms of the studies included in Yebyo et 0.0558, 95% CI: 0.0345- 0.0904). In all statin discontinuation scenarios, the annual discontinuation rate was varied around this esti- mate based on the 95% CI. Full statin adherence In this scenario analysis, the impact of full statin adherence was explored. Reduced effectiveness of statin therapy in patients above 75 years old In this scenario analysis, reduced treatment effectiveness was modelled in patients older than 75 years old. The IRR s of statin therapy vs. no therapy on CVD events used in the base- case analysis ( Table 8.3) were HTA Repo rt 85 increased with 10% (i.e. reducing the effectiveness of statins) based on the difference between all partici- pants and patients older than 75 years in RR per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol reported by Armitage et al.102 Disutility of taking a pill There is reason to believe that the act of taking a pill every day to prevent CVD may be associated with a small dis utility in otherwise healthy people. Previous studies therefore added a small disutility of 0.001 to account for this disadvantage of statin therapy in their analysis.92,103-106 In line with these studies, a scenario analysis was performed including an annual disutil ity of 0.001 for people on statin therapy. One-way sensitivity analyses (OWSA) Parameter uncertainty was first tested using one- way sensitivity analyses (OWSA); model parameters we re systematically and independently varied over a plausible range ( Table 8.11, e.g. using the 95% confidence interval or a 20% increase/decrease of the parameter value used in the base- case). The ICER was recorded at the upper and lower limits to produce tornado diagrams. Probabilistic sensitivity analyse s (PSA) Joint parameter uncertainty wa s explored through probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) where all param- eters to which probability distributions were assigned we re varied jointly. For costs and utilities, no data on uncertainty was available, ther efore we assumed the standard deviation was 10% of the mean to estimate the gamma and beta parameters required for estimating the distribution. 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed, and the results were recorded. Results were plotted on the cost -effectiveness plane (CE - plane). From these results, a cost -effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) was estimated. Table 8.11.

Population -level costs analysis The data required to perform a budget impact analysis (BIA) is illustrated in Figure 7. First, the number of people without CVD in the total Swiss population should be determined. Subsequently, this population needs to be divided in the different CVD risk groups according to the AGLA risk score. Finally, information is required on the current use of statins in every AGLA risk score group. HTA Repo rt 88 Figure 7. Required data for budget impact analysis Table 8.12 summarizes the availability of data for the BIA for primary prevention of CVD with statin therapy. There is age- and sex specific data on the size of the total Swiss population. However, there is only non- age and sex -specific data on the prevalence and incidence of CVD and the distribution of AGLA risk in the primary prevention population. Moreover, there is no data on the current use of statins in the primary pre- vention population. Table 8.12 Availability of data for budget impact analysis Parameter Availability Assumptions Size of the total Swiss population Age and sex specific data availabler Prevalence and incidence of CVD Data available but not age and sex specific (Nanchen et al.) Equal for all age and sex groups Distribution of AGLA risk in primary prevention population (i.e. without CVD) Data available but not age and sex specific (Romanens et al.) Equal for all age and sex groups Proportion of people using statins for primary prevention in every AGLA risk score group Not available As there was no data on the current use of statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD in different CVD risk groups it was not possible to model the budget impact (i.e. the difference in total costs between the HTA Repo rt 89 current situation with unrestricted use of statins and restricted reimbursement policies). In addition, the lack of age and sex specific data on the prevalence and incidence of CVD and distribution of AGLA risk in the primary preventi on population limited a careful analysis of the budget impact. As an alternative to the budget impact analysis , the maximum population- level annual overall costs of different policies of restrict ing statin therapy use was calculated . It was assumed that al l patients eligible for statin therapy would use statins (i.e. 100% uptake) at the real -world adherence rate assumed in the cost -effectiveness analysis (i.e. 69% in the first year of statin therapy). In this analysis, the same data and assumptions as in the cost -effectiveness analysis were used. Because the development of CVD risk over time and therefore the probabilities of CVD events in the model are dependent on age and sex, the model was run separately for males and females of all ages between 40 and 75 years and for three CVD risk groups (for the low risk group we assumed an AGLA risk score of 1%, for the intermediate risk group an AGLA risk score of 15%, and for the high risk group an AGLA risk score of 25%). For every subgroup, the annual costs per ye ar derived from the cost -effectiveness model were multiplied with the number of Swiss people in that specific subgroup. Depending on the criteria of the reimbursement policy, the total costs of specific subgroups were summed to determine the country level costs. The following reimbursement policies regarding CVD risk were considered: reimbursed for all CVD risks (i.e. high, intermediate and low CVD risk), reimbursed for only high or intermediate CVD risk, and reim-bursed for only high CVD risk. In addition, the reimbursement policies were assumed to be restricted for certain starting ages (i.e. the starting age is the age of treatment initiation, people will remain on statins during the rest of their lifetime despite of the age criteria of the reimbursement policy). The options were: no restriction (40- 75 years), restricted to starting age between 40 and 59 years, restricted to starting age between 60 and 75 years. Due to the lack of sex specific data, the costs were not reported for males and females separat ely.

Of those, 1, 484 rec ords were excluded based on their title and abstract, resulting in 110 articles selected to be screened in full -text, and 18 economic evaluations were finally included. The reasons for exclusion are provided in the PRISMA flow chart in Figure 8. Figure 8. PRISMA flow diagram cost- effectiveness search HTA Repo rt 91 8.2.2 Study characteristics table Study and model characteristics The study and model characteristics are presented in Table 8.13 and Table 8.14. The model structure of the included models was similar. All but one model (Stomberg et al.107) include patients without CVD who start statin therapy and are at risk of CVD events . In addition, in some models , patients are also at risk of adverse events related to statin therapy. If patients experience a CVD event , they transition to CVD events health states in which they may have a higher mortality probability and addi- tional costs f or secondary prevention therapy. The study design of all included studies was a cost -utility analysis, expressing outcomes in quality -adjusted life years (QALY) or disability -adjusted life years (DALY). McConnachie et al. was the only cost -utility anal- ysis study that was based on a trial -based economic evaluation; all other included studies were model - based economic evaluations.108 The study of McConnachie et al. was performed alongside the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) , which included 6, 595 men with hypercholesterolaemia without a history of MI. Most model -based economic evaluations used Markov models (n=13). The other studies were microsimulation models (n=3) or simple calculation models (n=1). The majority of studies were performed from a healthcare payer perspective (n=15); the other three studies applied a societal perspective. Eight of the studies were performed for the US, seven studies were per- formed for European countries, two studies for Canada, and one study for Japan. Among the seven Euro- pean studies, one study was conducted in Switzerland.109 The patient populations of interest can be divided into four categories ( Table 8.13 and Table 8.14): people from the general population without CVD (without further specifications), people from the general population without CVD but with elevated hs -CRP levels (high -sensitivity C -reactive protein; i.e. a test for CVD risk, higher hs -CRP levels indicate a higher risk of CVD ), people from the general population without CVD but with hyperlipidaemia or hypercholesterolaemia, and people with type 2 diabetes. The types of statins used in the intervention arms differed between the studies. Some studies only consid- ered low, moderate , or high potency statins, whiles oth ers focused on one specific statin. There seems to be an association between the patient population and the specific statin used in the intervention arm. In all five studies on patients with elevated hs -CRP, the statin used in the intervention arm was rosuvastatin because all studies were based on the JUPITER trial. Further, in two out of the three studies on patients HTA Repo rt 92 with type 2 diabetes, atorvastatin was the statin used in the intervention arm. Finally, pravastatin was used in both studies on patients wit h hyperlipidaemia/or hypercholesterolaemia. The type of comparator(s) used also differed between studies. Eight studies considered 'no statin treatment' as comparator. No statin treatment comparator was defined as 'standard care', which may or may not include lifestyle advice. A further seven studies evaluated statins versus placebo. One study compared statins with no lipid -regulating treatment (defined as no statins or any other lipid- lowering treatment), one study compared various CVD risk thresholds for statin therapy, and one study compared over the counter (OTC) statins with prescription statins. None of the studies compared statin therapy with lifestyle advice only. Eight of the included studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies producing statins.98,103,107,110 - 114 The authors of one SR of economic evaluations of statin therapy raised the issue of sponsorship bias in economic evaluations.115 Catala- Lopez et al. demonstrated an important sponsorship bias in the literature on the cost -effectiveness of statin therapy for prevention of CVD events. Pharmaceutical company -spon- sored stu dies were significantly less likely to reach neutral or unfavourable conclusions than non- pharma- ceutical company sponsored studies.115 In fact, all eight pharmaceutical company sponsored studies con- cluded that the corresponding statin had a favourable ICER compar ed to any of the other agents (including competing statins) or placebo.115 HTA Repo rt 93 Table 8.13.

In the PICO, three types of healthcare costs were distinguished: prevention- related, CVD -related, and future unrelated healthcare costs. Regarding prevention- related costs, all studies considered the costs of statins and most studies also considered the costs of monitoring and follow -up of patients using statins for primary prevention of CVD (e.g. laboratory tests and physician visits). The costs of adverse events of statin use were only included in seven studies. The reasons for the lack of adverse events caused by statins in the other studies were because these adverse events are considered r are, incidences were unknown, costs were expected to be low, or adverse events would disappear when patients discontinued statins. CVD -related costs of treatment of non- fatal events were included in all studies, 14 studies included long- term healthcare costs of CVD events (such as long- term follow -up or rehabilitation, and less than half of the studies (n=8) considered costs of fatal events). Finally, none of the studies considered the additional healthcare costs (unrelated to statin treatment or CVD) durin g the life years gained as a result of statin treatment . Table 8.15 provides an overview of non- health related costs included in the economic evaluations to provide insight in interpreting the cost -effectiveness results. Only three studies considered one or more types of non- healthcare related costs. Non- healthcare related and indirect healthcare- related costs are not considered in the primary perspective of cost assessments in economic evaluations in Switzerland, therefore it is im portant to note that in the full HTA future unrelated healthcare costs will not be consid- ered. Input parameters - effectiveness and CVD events Table 8.16 shows which effectiveness measures and utilities were includ ed. Effectiveness of statin treatment was based on relative risks or hazard ratios of CVD events with statin therapy compared to no statin therapy or placebo derived from meta- analyses or clinical trials (sources provided inTable 8.13). Adherence to statin treatment was considered in twelve of the 18 studies. Non- adherence was caused by adverse events leading to discontinuation of statin therapy or other non- specified reasons. The ef- fectiveness of statins was assumed to be reduced in patients without full adherence. Nine of the 18 studies considered adverse events of using statins. Table 8.16 provides an overview of adverse events of statin treatment and CVD events that were included in the economic evaluations. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were the most often included adverse events. Myopathy is a disease of HTA Repo rt 102 the muscle in which the muscle fibres do not function properly, which results in muscular weakness. Rhabdomyolysis is a condition in whi ch damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly, resulting in muscle pain, weakness, vomiting, and confusion. Some studies only included the impact of adverse events on the effect side by applying utility decrements and not on the cost side of the economic eval- uation.104,119 The CVD events that were considered are provided in Table 8.16. All studies included the impact of statins on the occurrence of MI and almost every study included the occurrence of ischemic strokes. In addition, the occurrences of unstable angina and coronary revascularisations were often included. The risk of CVD events was calculate d by importing the patient characteristics into the underlying risk scoring systems or based on observed event rates in trials or observational cohort studies. In half of the economic evaluations t here was variation in the CVD risk scoring system that was used to divide patients into different risk categories ( Table 8.13). Only one study used the scoring system recom- mended by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC): Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE). In the existing models patients were assigned in a risk group at baseline and only in half of the studies (n=9) the CVD events risk was updated during the time horizon of the model based on age.92,98,103,104,113,114,116,123 The other parameters in the risk equations were assumed to be constant. In some studies, this can be explained by the fact that the time horizon was equal to the CVD risk period provided by the risk scoring systems (i.e. 10- year CVD risk and 10- year model time horizon). In some studies with l onger time horizons, CVD risk was updated every year to account for increasing age.92,98,103,104,116,123 However, only in the study of Pandya et al. the updated CVD risk was dependent on other parameters included in the risk equations besides age.105 Background mortality (i.e. non- CVD related causes of death) was included in most studies. Six of these studies adjusted the general population mortality for deaths due to CVD. In the other studi es, double counting of deaths related to CVD may have occurred. Input parameters - utilities The utilities without CVD events were dependent on age in seven studies (i.e. utility decreases as age increases). All studies applied disutilities for CVD events , except for Stomberg et al.107 Stomberg et al. used a mean change in QALYs due to statin use versus no statin use or low -dose versus high- dose statin use derived from a previous cost -effectiveness study to cover utility effects of CVD events .107 HTA Repo rt 103 Most studies applied constant disutilities for CVD events , but in some studies the disutilities were re- duced after the first post -event year. In six studies, adverse events were associated with disutilities. Finally, five studies applied a small disutil ity for taking a pill every day. HTA Repo rt 104 Table 8.15.

Except for Onishi et al.123, all studies concluded that statin use for primary prevention of CVD was cost -effective in some CVD risk groups. However, the cost -effectiveness results were difficult to compare between stud- ies, because they all used dif ferent risk scoring systems and/or patient populations. In general, statin treatment for primary prevention of CVD was more cost -effective among higher CVD risk groups. In addition, cost-effectiveness results were more favourable for older age groups and i n men compared to women. All of the five studies that examined the cost -effectiveness of statin use for primary prevention of CVD in patients with normal LDL -C levels but elevated hs -CRP levels concluded that rosuvastatin was cost - effective compared to no statin treatment.98,103,113,114,122 They also agreed that rosuvastatin was even more cost -effective in patients with a 10- year CVD risk score (Framing ham risk score) of more than 10%. The three studies focusing on the use of statins for primary prevention of CVD in diabetes type 2- patients agreed that statins were cost -effective compared to no treatment in this patient population.92,110,112 How- ever, de Vries et al. noted that with real -world adherence rates, prescribing statins to diabetes type 2- patients younger than 45 years would not be cost -effective.92 Multiple studies concluded that treatment adherence had a major impact on cost -effectivenes s results of statin use in primary prevention.92,104,111,112,116 When real -world adherence was taken into account, the ICERs were higher than in full adherence scenarios. In addition, the costs of statins and disutility of taking a pill every day influenced the cost -effectiveness results. Finally, the chosen time horizon of the economic evaluation had a large influence on the re-sults. 104,109,113,116 Statins were more likely to be cost -effective when longer (especially lifetime) time ho- rizons were applied. Only two of the included studies performed a budget impact analysis. In their study, Conly et al. predicted statin expenditures in Canada for low risk patients using various definitions of low risk, these included: a) patients aged 40+ years without heart disease, diabetes , or stroke who are not currently on a statin, b) men aged 50+ years and women aged 60+ years without heart disease, diabe- tes, or stroke who are not currently on a statin, and c) men aged 50+ years and women aged 60+ years without heart disease, diabetes , or stroke and either hypertensive or smoker who are not currently on a statin. 111 Additional scenarios were included considering treatment regardless of LDL- C levels, only if LDL- C > 2.5 mmol/L, and only if LDL- C > 4.5 mmol/L. Conly et al. concluded that in their most unlikely scenario (all patients aged 40+ years without heart disease, diabetes , or stroke who are not currently on a statin) the eligible population would increase by 11.6 million people which results in an increased HTA Repo rt 108 expenditure of statins of $9.17 billion annually. However, the budget impact analysis did not take into account potential savings f rom averted cardiovascular events, or additional costs related to life years gained due to statin use.111 Stomberg et al. estimated the budget impact of OTC statins under the 2013 American College of Cardi-ology/ American Heart Association Guidelines. 107 The analysis by Stomberg et al. includes three groups of OTC statin people: a) previously untreated patients who meet statin guidelines, b) previously un- treated patients who do not meet statin guidelines, and c) previous prescription statin users who take up OTC statin treatment. They estimate an increase in total costs to the health system by approximately $12.6 billion. This budget impact analysis did not account for differences in compliance rates between OTC and prescription settings. Quality appraisal Table 8.17 shows the quality appraisal of the included studies using the CHEC checklist. The studies scored well on the items regarding the study design. Although a lifetime horizon is generally preferred due to the (potentially) lifetime effect of statins on CVD morbidity and mortality, some studies applied a shorter time horizon as the CVD risk was determined for 10 years. Therefore, only studies with a time horizon shorter than 10 years were penalised on this item . The studies were not scored for the questions with regards to included costs and outcomes (question 7-12), because this requires an in- depth analysis to determine which costs should be included and what the optimal measurement and valuation methods are. Instead we provided an overview of included costs and outcomes in Table 8.15 and Table 8.16. The included studies also performed well regarding reporting and interpreting the results; all studies performed incremental analyses and their conclusions followed from the reported data. Further, almost all studies discounted both costs and effects and most studies subjected all important uncertain varia- bles to sensitivity analyses. However, almos t half of the studies did not discuss generalisability of the results and only one study discussed ethical and distributional issues. Furthermore, in eight studies at least some of the authors were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. Overall, study qual ity was deemed moderate to good with only a few areas lacking such as generalisability of results and the fact that almost half of the studies was sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry in some form.

HTA Repo rt 111 8.2.4 Findings of the de novo cost-effectiveness model This paragraph describes the results of the cost -effectiveness analyses performed with the de novo cost-effectiveness model specifically developed for this study. Base- case analysis Table 8.18, Table 8.19, and Table 8.20 show the incremental cost -effectiveness ratios ( ICERs ), of statin therapy versus no statin therapy in all age, sex, and AGLA risk subgroups. The ICER represents the difference in costs of statin therapy and no statin therapy divided by the differences in QALYs. This means that a negative ICER can be the result of a reduction in costs and increase in QALYs or an increase in costs and reduction in QALYs. All negative ICERs in this study ( Table 8.18) are caused by higher lifetime QALYs ( Table 8.19) and lower total lifetime healthcare costs ( Table 8.20) for statin therapy (i.e. statin therapy is cost saving and in- creases QALYs). In general, the ICER was higher in older age groups, males, and lower AGLA risk score groups. The ICER was hi gher in older age groups because due to the lifetime time horizon of the model there was less time to enjoy the benefits of statins (i.e. prevention of CVD events) than in younger age groups . There are several reasons for the higher ICERs in males than females: 1) the increase in CVD risk over time is higher in females , 2) the increase in mortality risk after stroke and MI (SMR) is higher in females, and 3) females have a higher life expectancy . Consequently, the incremental benefits of preventing CVD event with statins are higher in females. Finally, the ICERs were higher in lower AGLA risk groups because in these subgroups less CVD events are prevented that can offset the costs of statin therapy than in higher AGLA risk groups . HTA Repo rt 112 Table 8.18. Incremental cost -effectiveness ratios (ICER) in CHF per QALY of base -case CER CHF/QALY, Green (light): < 50,000 CHF/QALY, Green (dark): Cost saving. These negative ICERs were all caused by lower total life- time healthcare costs and higher lifetime QALYs for statin therapy (i.e. statin therapy dominates no statin therapy) . Table 8.19 Incremental QALYs of base- case analysis in 8.20 Incremental costs (in CHF) of base -case analysis in all Table 8.21 shows the full results of one of the subgroups that will be considered in scenario analyses : 50-year old males with an AGLA risk of 1% at baseline. In this subgroup, statins prevented 21 MIs and 10 strokes per 1000 people. On average, a person on statin therapy gained 0. 09 QALYs and the healthcare costs were CHF 7,660 higher compared to a person without statin therapy, resulting in an ICER of CHF 88,152/ QALY. Table 8.21. Full results of base -case analysis in 50- year old males with baseline AGLA risk of 1% Therapy MI Stroke LYs (undis- counted) 88,152 Scenario analyses Table 8.22 presents the results of the scenario analyses of one of the subgroups: 50- year old males with an AGLA risk of 1% at baseline. The time horizon, discount rate, disutility of taking a pill, and ad- herence to statin therapy had the largest impact on the cost -effectiveness results. The results of the scenario analyses are discussed in more detail below. HTA Repo rt 114 Table 8.22. Results of scenario analyses in 50- year old males wi th baseline AGLA risk of 1% Scenario Costs (in CHF) QALYs ICER % change case ICER Base case 7,660 0.09 88,152 0% Time lifetime 4,319 0.04 Constant annual discontinuation 3 years decreasing annual 7,660 0.07 116,874 33% Time horizon Limiting the time horizon to 10 years instead of lifetime increased the ICER substantially because the benefits of using statins for primary prevention of CVD often occur beyond 10 years. In other words, the increase in healthcare costs of using statins is not offset by the benefits of preventing CVD events in the first 10 years. Discounting As CVD risk increases over time due to ageing, the b enefits of using statins increase over time. How- ever, due to discounting costs and benefits in the future are valued less than present costs and benefits. Therefore, the ICER decreases if discounting is not applied and the ICER increases if a higher discount rate is used. Additional increase in CVD risk over time due to other risk factors than age The results in Table 8.22 showed that an additional increase of 5% in CVD risk over time due to other risk factors includ ed in the AGLA risk calculator (i.e. systolic blood pressure, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, family history of MI) than age lowers the ICER with 5%. Figure 9 shows the impact of varying the assumed annual additional increase in CVD risk between 0% ( risk adjustment factor is 1) and 20% (risk adjustment factor is 1.20) . If the additional increase in CVD risk over time is larger, statin therapy will prevent more CVD events and therefore the ICER decreases. HTA Repo rt 115 Figure 9. Impact of the assumed annual additional increase in CVD risk over time due to other risk factors than age Disutilities after MI and stroke Changing the assumptions on the duration of impact on utility of MI and stroke only has a limited effect on the ICER. If the disutility for MI is increased from one year in the base- case to lifetime in the scenario analysis, the ICER decreases with 7% because the benefits of preventing a MI with statin therapy are larger. In contrast, if the disutility of stroke is decreased from lifetime in the base- case to one- year in the scenario analysis, the ICER increases with 8 % because the benefits of preventing a stroke with statin therapy are smaller . Adverse events The results of the scenar io analyses including adverse events are presented in Table 8.23. Without including the costs of treatment of renal and hepatic dysfunction, the impact on the cost -effectiveness results is very small. Figur e 10 shows the impact of varying the costs of treatment of renal and hepatic dysfunction between 0 and 100,000 CHF on the ICER. If the costs of treatment of renal dysfunction or hepatic dysfunction were assumed to be 100,000 CHF, the ICER increased with 3.5% to 91,697 CHF or with 11.6% to 101,931 CHF, respectively. Table 8.23. Full results of scenario analysis with adverse events Therapy MI Stroke LYs QALYs Costs Repo rt 116 Figure 10. Impact of varying treatment costs of renal and hepatic dysfunction on the ICER Statin discontinuation due to adverse events Four scenarios with varying assumptions on statin discontinuation due to adverse events were per- formed (see results in Table 8.22). A constant annual discontinuation probability during the entire lifetime of the patient had the highest impact on the ICER. Figure 11 shows the impact of varying the annual discontinuation probability in this scenario analysis (red dot represents the probability that was used in the constant annual discontinuat ion lifetime scenario in Table 8.22: 0.0558). If there is a higher annual probability that patients will stop statin therapy (i.e. discontinuation), the ICER increases. HTA Repo rt 117 Figure 11. Sensitivity analysis of an nual discontinuation probability in constant annual discon- tinuation scenario analysis Statin adherence In the base- case, a treatment adherence of 69% in the first year and 60% in subsequent years was assumed. Table 8.22 shows the cost -effectiveness results when patients are fully adherent to statin therapy. In Figure 12 the impact of varying treatment adherence in subsequent years from 20% to 100% is illustrated. The red dot represents the base case assumption of 60% . The figure illustrates that higher treatment adherence estimates results in lower ICER s. Figure 12. Sensitivity analysis of treatment adherence HTA Repo rt 118 Reduced effectiveness age >75 years Reduced treatment effectiveness in patients older than 75 years old, reduces the benefits of statin ther- apy and therefore the ICER increases. Disutility of taking a pill When a small disutility of 0.001 is included to take into account for the disadvantage of statin therapy to take a pill every day, the benefits of statin therapy are reduced and therefore the ICER increases. As this disutility is applied during the patient's whole lifetime, the impact on the ICER is considerable. One-way sensitivity analyses ( OWSA) The results of the OWSA for the subgroup of 50- year old males with baseline AGLA risk of 1% are illustrated in the tornado diagram in Figure 13 and the detailed results are presented in Table 8.24 . The effect of statins in reducing CVD events for statins versus no statins IRR CVD death, IRR stroke, and IRR MI) , the treatment adherence in subsequent years , the proportion of MI versus CVD death, and the costs of a statin pill and G P visit had the largest impact on the ICER. In addition, OWSA were performed for the scenario analysis including adverse events. The results of this analysis are presented in Appendix 15.9. The effect of statins in reducing CVD events (i.e. IRRs) had the l argest impact on the cost-effectiveness results, followed by the incidence of the adverse events without statins. Disutility and costs of adverse events only had a minor impact on the cost -effectiveness results. HTA Repo rt 119 Figure 13.

The mean incremental costs and QALYs of the PSA iterations were 8,060 CHF and 0. 08 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of 104,637 CHF/QALY. The difference between the deterministic and prob- abilistic ICER can be explained by the use of lognormal distributions for the relative proportions and IRRs of CVD events. The cost -effectiveness plane shows that there is uncertainty about whether statins are cost -saving or cost -increasing and whether more or less QALYs are gained. The red dot represents the deterministic ICER . Figure 14. Cost -effectiveness plane The cost -effectiveness acceptability curve s hows the probability that statin therapy is optimal is 33.4% at a willingness -to-pay threshold per QALY of 50,000 CHF and 62.7% at a willingness -to-pay threshold per QALY of 100,000 CHF. HTA Repo rt 123 Figure 15. Cost -effectiveness acceptability curve 8.2.5 Findings population- level cost analysis As mentioned before, the budget impact compared to current unrestricted use could not be estimated because of lack of data on the current use of statins in Switzerland. Instead of the budget impact, the annual population- level costs of the different statin therapy reimbursement policies were calculated. Table 8.25 shows the total healthcare costs (including all costs specified in paragraph 8.1.5) for different reimbursement policies based on CVD risk and age assuming all eligible patients will start using statin therapy with real-world treatment adherence of 69% . Table 8.25 Total annual healthcare costs of different reimbursement policies of statins Reimbursement policy Number of people using statins Total annual healthcare costs (in 124 Summary statement cost-effectiveness and population -level costs Eighteen economic evaluations of statin therapy were identified in the sys tematic literature search . Considering the lack of high -quality cost -effectiveness studies in the Swiss context, lack of cost- effectiveness studies using one of the preferred risk scoring systems in Switzerland, and changes in prices of statins due to the introduction of generics, a de novo model was developed that incorporated the most recent and (where possible) Switzerland -specific effectiveness, costs, and utility evidence. This de novo model showed that from a healthcare payer perspective, applying a l ifetime time horizon with discounting, assuming real -world treatment adherence and no discontinuation due to adverse events, the cost -effectiveness of statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD com- pared to no statin therapy varied substantially across su bgroups . ICERs were lower in sub- groups with higher CVD risk, younger age , and female sex. The ICER was above 100,000 CHF/QALY in males with a starting age of 55 years or higher and females with a starting age of 65 years or higher with an AGLA risk of 1%. The ICER was between 50,000 and 100,000 CHF/QALY in males with a starting age between 45-55 years with an AGLA risk of 1%, males with a starting age of 75 years with an AGLA risk of 5%, females with a starting age between 55-65 years with an AGLA risk of 1%, and females with a starting age of 75 years with an AGLA risk of 5%. For all other subgroups, the ICER was below 50,000 CHF/QALY. Moreover, statin therapy was even more effective and cost -saving in males with a starting age between 40- 65 with an AGLA ri sk of 15%, males with a starting age between 40-70 years with an AGLA risk of 20% and males with a starting age between 40-75 years with an AGLA risk of 25%, females with a starting age between 40- 70 years with an AGLA risk of 15%, and females with a start ing age between 40- 70 years with an AGLA risk of 20% or 25%. The various scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses showed the influence of specific as-sumptions and parameters on the outcomes. A shorter time horizon, applying a higher discount factor , and including a disutility of taking a pill increased the ICERs significantly. The effective- ness of statins in reducing CVD events , the proportion of MI versus CVD deaths, and the costs of statin therapy were important parameters that introduced uncertainty ab out the cost- effec- tiveness of statin therapy. The PSA showed that the uncertainty was relatively large around the ICER estimate. Due to a lack of data on the current use of statins for primary prevention of CVD in various CVD risk groups in Switzerland, the budget impact of restricted reimbursement policies compared to HTA Repo rt 125 the current unrestricted use of statin therapy in Switzerland could not be determined. Instead, the maximum population -level annual healthcare costs of reimbursement policies were esti- mated. Reimbursing statins for all patients above 40 years old, regardless of CVD risk, and as- suming 100% uptake and real -world adherence to statin therapy was associated with annual healthcare costs of 934 million CHF. The annual healthcare costs decreased when the reimburse- ment policy was restricted to certain age groups and CVD risks, with annual healthcare costs of around 4 million CHF in the most restricted reimbursement policy where statin therapies were only reimbursed for people between 60 and 75 years ol d at high CVD risk.

The legal and social and ethical search strategies and the results are detailed below. Legal issues search A search filter for legal evidence was added to the 'Patient population' and 'Intervention' search terms that were used in the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety search and cost -effectiveness search in Pub- Med (MEDLINE) and Embase.com (see Appendix 15.5 ). Social and e thical issues search Following the recommendations in the HTA Core Model Version 3.0128, modified search filters from Droste et al. 2010129 were embedded to the clinical search strings regarding CVD and statins ( see Ap- pendix 15.6). The same inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for these searches (see Table 9.1). Table 9.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria other HTA domain searches Inclusion Exclusion Period publica- tion No res triction on period of publication: be- cause other HTA domain issues might be identified in earlier publications. Study language German English French Dutch All other languages Country of study Western countries* Study population Patients wi thout previous cardiovascular events Patients with previous cardiovascular events Study interven- tion (Zocor\u00ae and generics) Other interventions The same quality control measures were put in place in the other HTA domains literature searches as for the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety and cost -effectiveness literature searches. HTA Repo rt 127 The first 30% of titles and abstracts from the peer -reviewed literature were screened in duplicate by two independent researchers from iMTA. The results were compared and discussed before the remaining references were assessed by one researcher. During screening there was more than 5% discrepancy between the two researchers, therefore all titles and abstracts were screened in duplicate. Any conflicts were discussed and amended accordingly. The first 10% of the full -text articles from the peer -reviewed literature were assessed for rele- vancy and critically appraised in duplicate by two independent researchers from iMTA. Again, during screening there was more than 5% discrepancy between the two researchers, therefore all full-text articles were screened in duplicate. Any conflicts were discussed and amended ac- cordingly. 9.1.2 Other s ources For legal aspects, a search in the Swiss legislation databasew (in German, English, French languages; for all legal product types; for both national and international law documents; for both in force and not in force legislations) was conducted to find any relevant legislation documents associated with statin ther- apy, from 1848 until 2019. The terms \"statins\" and \"cardiovascular disease\", and their German and French translations were entered. The legal documents from the search in the Swiss legislation database did not include any information related to statin therapy. 9.1.3 Assessment of quality of evidence Not applicable. 9.1.4 Methodology data analysis legal, social and ethical issues The summary of the findings related to the legal, social, and ethical domains are provided narratively.

We identified one study on the role of regulators in approving the use of statins .130 Jefferson et al. argue that regulators across the world approved statins for the primary prevention of CVD despite the important debate on whether benefits outweigh their harms.130 They examined the regulators knowledge, access and independent assessment of the presented data in 32 European countries. Only a few countries were able to consistently defend their decision -making. Moreover, only a few countries had done an independent scrutiny of the presented safety data. The main reason for not performing an independent analysis of safety data was the lack of pre- and post -marketing harm -related data . This data was either inaccessible or (low -middle level) adverse events were excluded from the benefit/harm analysis be- cause of vague defin itions . 9.2.4 Findings social issues Findings on the social domain regarding the use of statins for primary prevention of CVD focused on three main issues : adherence to statin therapy and its determinants , the disutility of daily intake of a statin pill, and patient preferences and shared decision -making. Adherence to statin therapy Fourteen articles examined the demographic and socioeconomic determinants of (real -world) adher- ence to statin therapy. The most relevant determinants included self -perceived risk, income, sex, eth- nicity, age and comorbidities. The list of relevant factors associated with adherence are provided in Table 9.2. We also identified several studies which discussed the impact of changes to patient co- pay- ments for statins. These studies will be discussed in the 'Organisational issues' section in Chapter 0 .2.2. Table 9.2.

The magnitude of the association varied, but the trend seems to be (almost) universal. This negative association between the female sex and s tatin adherence may be caused by a higher engagement in healthier lifestyles, higher health liter- acy, and a different health- seeking behaviour of females compared to males .131 These characteristics may make them less willing to engage in long- term drug treatments like statins . Also, females are more likely to be dissatisfied with their statin medication, to report statin- related adverse events, and to dis- continue therapy bec ause of adverse events.131,132,138 Other explanations include the general miscon- ception by both patients and physicians that females bear less CVD risk than males , and the fact that females frequently serve as caregivers for family members which in turn has been associated with lower rates of medication adherence.137 Age HTA Repo rt 132 Age appeared to have a bell -shaped relationship with adherence with the relatively young adults (< 45- 50 years) and those above 65- 70 ye ars of age showing lower rates of adherence compared to middle- aged adults .132,134 The low adherence rates among the youngest and the oldest groups have led policies and guidelines updates to focus on stimulati ng the uptake of statins in these subgroups. In Denmark, this resulted in a triplicate in the proportion of individuals in primary prevention in the extremes of the age range.141 In contrast, Chan et al. found an association of decreasing adherence with age, even in the group of elderly individuals in his sample.72 An explanation for this could be that their sample did not include a large proportion of adults over 65- 70 years.41 Ethnicity Three articles analysed the association between ethnicity and adherence.41,134,137 Their findings suggest that non- white patients are less likely to be adherent and this is more pronounced for those in primary prevention compared to secondary prevention.41,134,137 The article by Lewey et al. provides the following potential reasons : non-white patients experience increased barriers to access high- quality care, are less likely to have a cons istent relationship with a primary care provider compared with white patients with similar levels of insurance, exhibit overall more mistrust towards the health care system, more often lack knowledge on how to navigate the healthcare system , and may face c ommunication barriers that hinder the understanding of the healthcare provider 's instructions .137 Perceived risk The systematic review by Lemstra et al. showed that primary prevention patients were 52% less likely to be adherent compared to secondary prevention patients.133 This can be explained by the d ifferences in perceived risk of disease between these two groups135, and is highly associated with the presence of cardiovascular -related comorbidities.41,133,134,136,137 Due to these low adherence rates, statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD could become ineffective even for the high- risk young individuals.116 Statin -related media coverage Two articles examined the effect of statin- related media coverage on statin utili sation for the primary prevention of CVD. One French study explored the effect of a particular case of controversial media coverage regarding the efficacy of statin therapy continuation among patients in different risk catego- ries.142 This controversy started in 2013 when a French retired professor of medic ine published a book refuting the efficacy of statins for cardiovascular prevention and the subsequent wide broadcast of the book and interviews with the author in a variety of media. Bezin et al. found that after the controversy, low- and middle- risk pati ents were 40% and 53% more likely to discontinue their therapy in the short - run, respectively .142 In the UK, a similar situation emerged in October 2013 when two articles published in the BMJ suggest ed that statin side effects outweigh their benefits in patients at low and middle CVD HTA Repo rt 133 risk. The debate peaked and achieved national media coverage.143 However, the controversy had no significant impact on statin initiation for prim ary prevention of CVD among high- risk patients compared with before the controversy .143 Disutility of taking a pill In the study by Fontana et al. (2014), the authors weighted the disutility of taking a pill against the expected long-term health gain from statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD.144 They showed that two thirds of the eligible subjects desired at least one month of life expectancy gain to consider adher- ence to statin therapy to be worthwhile. Most notably , 12% of the subjects reported to experience ex- treme disutility and would require more than 10 years of extended life expectancy in order to commit to a long- term statin therapy . Shared decision maki ng In primary prevention, physicians are often faced with the dilemma of giving a therapy to a relatively healthy individual in order to prevent future healthcare events, even though this patient could experience harmful events from taking the preventive t herapy. Physicians have their own preferences and beliefs regarding statin treatment in primary prevention of CVD and evidence suggests that there is a clear discrepancy between the perceived care and actual care provided by physicians. One study showed that while physicians claim to follow the latest guideline recommendations and assured to give a statin to hypothetical patients in the study , in practice this was not the case. Practitioners with higher belief in statins are more likely to follow the guidel ine recommendations in real practice. In addition to disutility of taking a pill every day , patients may question the efficacy of statins and fear the adverse events.145,146 The balance between benefits and harms is often not eas ily reduced to a yes/no decision. Patient -centred guidelines regarding cholesterol treatment for the primary prevention of CVD should recognize this and should avoid recommendations based solely on cut -off values and embrace shared decision- making.145,147 -149 Decisions regarding statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD should always consider a patient' s perspective and preferences.146,147 In order to increase shared decision- making , some articles sug- gested the use of specific tools to improve communication and empower the patient in the decision- making process.144,147,149 Luymes et al. analysed the barriers and enablers encountered between patients and their GPs after an update in cardiovascular prevention guidelines and reimbursement policy which resulted in the exclusion of patients with low CVD risk from the reimbursement scheme in the Netherlands. 150 Patients were gen- erally positive toward deprescribing preventive cardiovascular medication and they relied on the infor- mation and expertise of their GP to determine the justification of deprescription . The main barrier for HTA Repo rt 134 deprescri ption was a patient' s fear towards the (health) consequences of stopping their statin therapy . The assurance that follow -up care was available and that medication could be restarted if deemed re- quired, facilitated the process and acceptance of deprescription of statins by Dutch patients .150 9.2.5 Findings ethical i ssues Two ethical issues w ere identified in the systematic literature search. The first issue was related to health disparities in primary prevention of CVD and statin therapy. Seven articles addressed this issue and one of these compared population- based approaches versus individual -level measures to reduce CVD risk.151-157 The other issue was related to the quality of evidence used for recommendations for primary prevention of CVD with statins .158-160 In the scoping report, it was questioned whether it would be ethical if patients with good adherence to statin therapy that belong to subgroups with low predicted adherence were to be denied reimbursement from statin therapy . In our extended systematic literature search, we did not find any articles that pro- vided additional information on this topic. Health disparities in statin therapy for the primary prevention of CVD Health disparities were most frequently associated with differences in socioeconomic status (income and education) , ethnicity , and sex. Socioeconomic status One study examined the change in cholesterol levels over time after the introduction of statins for pri- mary prevention across different income groups in the US . Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1970 and 2004, the article showed that statins were more often adopted by those with higher income which led to widening health disparities that favour ed the wealthy .153 An- other US study showed that patients with lower education and income level receive poorer care for the prevention of CVD despite their higher CVD risk .154 In contrast to these findings in the US , no evidence of socioeconomic inequality in sta tin use was found in the UK .157 Ethnicity Health disparities also exist among certain ethnic groups whose CVD risk is underestimated by the available risk scores, which is most notably the case for people of South Asian descent.155 In addition, non-white individuals are systematically prescribed less statins for primary prevention of CVD although they are eligible for statin therapy .151,152 HTA Repo rt 135 Sex Evidence also suggests that health disparities exist across sexes . Females are less likely to be told or engage in discussions with their doctors about their CVD risk compared with m ales, making them less likely to receive treatment with statins for primary prevention of CVD.138,140 This inequality is closely related to the determinants of adherence to statin therapy discussed in Chapter 9.2.4. Reducing health disparities Structural measures aimed at reducing risk factors at the socioenvironmental level or whole- population approaches have the potential to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in c ardiovascular health. An exam- ple of this provided by Capewell et al. is the Norsjo Community Intervention Program in Sweden. This program combined population health and health sector interventions , generating local health promotion collaboration between healthcare providers, grocery stores, schools, and municipal authorities. Individ- ual risk factors screening, and counselling was provided by primary care physicians and community interventions and also included food labelling modifications to encourage adher ence to healthy diets. Through this program a 36% reduction in CVD mortality risk was achieved , with disadvantaged groups benefiting the most .156 In this way, p opulation- based approach es have a strong ethical background as governments should respect, protect, and fulfil their obligations related to public health for everyone. Questioning the quality of the evidence There has been great debate about the quality of the evidence used to support the guideline rec om- mendations, especially the ACC/AHA 201320, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2019, and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) 2019. These guidelines suggest extended primary prevention to populations considered 'healthy' and composed mainly of young individuals. T he validity of the find- ings that support these guidelines is questioned due to the already large and inc reasing amount of industry -funded studies .159 The conflicting interest s affect s the transparency of the results , stimulate s publication bias and jeopardi ses the real -value assessment of new drugs and technologies.158,159 HTA Repo rt 136 Summary statement legal, social and e thical issues Despite variations across studies, the association between low socioeconomic status or low income and non -adherence seems to be almost universal. Differences in adherence behaviour signals a trend in which females are less likely to be adherent than males and that both younger patients (below 50 years old) and older patients (above 70 years) tend to be less adherent than middle -aged patients (50 -70 years) . People using statins for primary p revention of CVD tend to have lower adherence rates than people who use statins for secondary prevention for CVD, which is most likely explained by low self -perceived risk of disease. Several studies found that p atients experience disutility of taking a p ill each day , especially for primary prevention of disease . Disregarding this disutility and the patients' preference s lies far away from the model of patient- centredness and should therefore be considered . In addition, physicians are often faced with the dilemma of giving a therapy to a relatively healthy individual in order to prevent future healthcare events, even though this patient could experience harmful events from taking the preventive therapy. Health disparities due to the introduction of statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD were most frequently associated with differences in income, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and sex. In general, access to statin therapy seems to be restricted to those better -off in systems without universal health coverage (like the US), which imposes a risk for widening wealth -related ine- qualities in health outcomes of CVD. No evidence of socioeconomic inequality in statin use was found in the UK, but there were ethnic -related disparities. There was no specific evi dence on health disparities in statin therapy in Switzerland available in the literature . Finally , there has been great debate about the quality of the evidence used to support the guide- line recommendations . Policy makers have to be aware of the issues regarding the quality of evidence on which guidelines are based in order to make informed decisions.

Table 10.2. Supply and distribution factors analysed Factor s analysed Definition First author and publication year Dispensation delay Time between prescription and dispen- sation Aarnio 201487, Abbass et al. 2017161 Prescription size Number of pills supply or days covered after every prescription/dispensation Batal 2007162, Ellis 2004164 Ordering method Mail ordering - received via mail Pittman 2011165, Chaud hry 2008163 Dispensation delay, small prescription size and traditional in- person ordering were associated with lower statin adherence in different healthcare system s.87,161 -165 These studies included populations of both primary and s econdary prevention patients and the effect of these factors was not disaggregated by prevention category. Aarnio et al. (2014) found that a longer dispensation delay was a predict or for poor adherence to statins . Dispensation delay is influenced by the number of pharmacies in the community, the possibility to re- ceive the medication via post at home and the way prescriptions are refilled and sent to pharmacies.87,161 Findings suggest s that patients who receive a larger quantity of pills (more than two- month supply) with each refill have higher adherence162,164 and that mail ordering and mail refill reminders are useful tools to increase adherence.163,165 These strategies were particularly relevant for the most vulnerable patients and those with limited resources as it may reduce direct and indirect costs related to prescription refill- ing.162,163,173 10.2.2 Impact of changes in co -payment on adherence In total seven articles identified in the organi sational search87,161 -166 and three articles from the social search41,133,173 examined the effect of co- payments and out -of-pocket expenditures on adherence to statin therapy. All articles found a negative association between higher co- payment and adherence. One article examined the effect of a (publicly -funded) voucher that served as a waiver on the co- payment HTA Repo rt 141 costs and was associated with higher adherence rates among the beneficiaries group (including patients on statin therapy for secondary prevention of CVD) .166 10.2. 3 Generici sation of statins Different strategies to incentivize the prescription of generic statins and their effects on statin expendi- ture, utili sation and/or adherence were described in the identified studies . These strategies included modification of plan design factors172, changes on restricted reimbursement national policies168,169, and demand- side measures .170 It is important to note that these strategies do not necessarily reflect strate- gies employed in Switzerland. Cox et al. studied the effect of moving atorvastatin out of the reimbursement formulary on patient be- haviour. Due to the removal of atorvastatin form the reimbursement formulary, the co- payment price changed which stimulated the uptake of statins included in the formulary.172 Two studies analysed the impact of restricted reimbursement national policies on statin use and ex- penditures in the context of publicly funded healthcare systems in Scandinavia.168,169 Their findings sug- gest that when generici sation is formally enforced, switching rates can be as high as 60% after the first year168 generating saving of as much as 20% in the first year.169 Enforcing well -designed demand- side measures aimed at stimulating the uptake of generics statins can have a positive effect on statin prescription and use while containing costs at the same time.170 These demand- side measures include the design of value- based care indicators and quality targets, provision of economic incentives, revision and update of guidelines, education of healthcare providers to stimulate the prescription of low -cost statins and enforcement of all these policies through different regulations.170 The generici sation of statins is associated with switching behaviour and, therefore, risk of discontinua- tion, nonadherence or potentially inappropriate statin use.168,171,172 One study explored the impact of generic substitution and found that the large majority of patients were switched to equipotent doses and adherence rates were relatively high after switching to a generic equipotent dose after 6 months. 171 Summary statement organisational issues There is evidence that supply and distribution factors, like prescription size and delay, as well as the level of co -payments by patients, influence statin adherence and, consequently, health outcomes. Several articles discuss the potential of genericisation of statins and its positive ef- fect on adherence rates and cost containment. HTA Repo rt 142 11 Additional issues Due to our broad search f or legal, social, ethical and organisational issues related to statins, no addi- tional issues were encountered that were not already covered in the previous chapters. HTA Repo rt 143 12 Discussion The present HTA evaluated the efficacy, effectiveness, safety, cost -effectiveness, and population -level costs of statin therapy for prevention of CVD compared to no statin therapy in adults without established CVD (i.e. primary prevention) and with low, medium, and (very) high CVD risk , based on available scientific literature. In this section, the main findings, strengths, and limitations of this HTA are discussed. Main findings efficacy, effectiveness, and safety Evidence from RCTs show ed that statin therapy prescribed to adults without established CVD is effec- tive in the prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality under study conditions (i.e. efficacy). How- ever, there was limited evidence that these effects can be replicated under real -world circumstances (i.e. effectiveness). The evidence regarding the safety of statins was inconclusive . In their SR, Yebyo et al. found a significant increased risk of renal and hepatic dysfunction, but the quality of this evidence was low or moderate.26 Findin gs of the meta- analysis conducted for this HTA report , which in contrast to Yebyo et al. consider ed differences in follow -up duration between the trials in the meta- analysis , did not show a statistically significant risk of these adverse events when using statins. The occurrence of these adverse events was rare (1 to 4 events per 1,000 statin users per year in the meta- analysis con- ducted for this report ). Although the comparative evidence for safety is inconclusive, the event rate is low. Risk scores for CV D were hardly reported in the studies and therefore no stratification of the effi- cacy, effectiveness, or safety results was available for people with low, medium, or (very) high CVD risk . Main findings cost- effectiveness In addition to the clinical consequ ences, it is important to assess what the impact of these possible foregone benefits of statin therapy is on people's life expectancy and health- related quality of life and how this relates to the costs of statin therapy. According to a simplified calculat ion with a 5- year time horizon in the Swiss Medical Board (SMB) report of 201325, the ICER of the use of statins for primary prevention was around CHF 210,000 per QALY . The liter ature was searched for a cost -effectiveness analysis using a comprehensive cost -effectiveness model adopting a lifetime time horizon, incorporating up-to-date Swiss clinical and economic input parameters, and using the most often used CVD risk scor- ing syst em in Switzerland (i.e. the AGLA Risk Score) was required. Furthermore, decision makers do not only need a precise point estimate of the cost -effectiveness of statins, but extensive scenario and sensitivity analyses should also give them insight in the unc ertainty surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being addressed. Such an economic evaluation was not identified in the literature. Therefore, a de novo cost -effectiveness model including the beforementioned characteristics was de- veloped in our HTA. HTA Repo rt 144 In the following paragraph, we compared our results with the results of previous cost -effectiveness stud- ies. First, i n line with the results from previous cost -effectiveness studies, the results of our cost -effec- tiveness analyses showed that statin t herapy for primary prevention of CVD was especially cost -effec- tive in subgroups with higher CVD risk as more CVD events can be prevented in these subgroups . Second, and i n contrast to previous studies, ICERs were higher in older age groups in our cost-effec- tiveness analyses . This difference is caused by the different time horizons used in the previous studies (often 10 years) and the current study (lifetime). When applying a lifetime horizon, older patients have less time to enjoy the benefits of statins (i .e. prevention of CVD events) than younger patients explaining the higher ICERs in older age groups . Finally, a s opposed to findings in previous studies, our study found lower ICERs in females compared to males. There are two reasons for this difference. F irst, pre- vious studies often only adjusted background mortality for sex, while we also used sex -specific input parameters for increase in CVD risk over time and increased mortality after CVD events (i.e. SMRs). The AGLA risk calculator showed that the incr ease in CHD risk over time is higher in females compared to males.79 Furthermore, the probability to die after a stroke or MI was higher in females compared to males.85 Consequently, the benefits of preventing CVD with statins are higher in females, resulting in lower ICERs compared to males. Second, because we applied a lifetime horizon (in contrast to most previous studies) and females on average have a higher life expectancy than males, females have more time to enjoy the benefits of statin therapy than males . The scenario analyses per formed in our HTA confirm the large impact of treatment adherence and dis- utility of 'taking a pill every day' on the cost -effectiveness of statins found in previous studies. In addition, we showed that t he time horizon and discount rates have a large impac t on the cost -effectiveness out- comes. OWSA showed that the parameters for the effect of statins in reducing CVD events for statins versus no statins (i.e. IRR CVD death, IRR stroke, and IRR MI), the proportion of MI versus CVD deaths, the treatment adherence in subsequent years and the costs of a statin pill and GP visit had the largest impact on the ICER. Finally, sensitivity analyses showed that uncertainty around the exact value of the input parameters has a large impact on the uncertainty in the cost -effectiveness results. Main findings population -level costs The cost -effectiveness analyses provided information about the balance between costs and benefits per patient, but as the size of lower CVD risk groups is large, it is also important to estimate the impact of theoretically prescribing statin therapies to all these people on the national healthcare budget. Our pop- ulation -level cost analysis showed that the costs of reimbursing statin therapy in people with all CVD risks (i.e. including low CVD risk) are large, while our cost -effectiveness analyses showed that the num- ber of CVD events that occur without statin therapy in (especially older) people with low CVD risk is limited. However, it should be noted that it is unknown how many people with low CVD ri sk are currently HTA Repo rt 145 using statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD events in Switzerland. Therefore, cost savings re- sulting from restricting reimbursement of statin to moderate and/or high risk could not be determined in this study . Main findings other H TA domains When considering possible restriction of statins to certain subgroups of people, relevant legal, social, ethical, and organisational issues should also be considered. For example, one should consider that changes in reimbursement policy can furt her increase health disparities between patients based on age, sex, race, and social economic status. In addition, real -world adherence to statins differs greatly from adherence in a clinical setting, especially in case of primary prevention. This should be considered when interpreting the results from the cost -effectiveness analyses. Strengths One of the main strengths of this HTA is the systematic search for SRs, RCTs, and non- randomised studies on the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of primary preven tion of CVD with statins in multiple peer-reviewed literature databases. A rigorous methodology, adhering to international methodological standards such as Cochrane and PRISMA, was applied to identify, critically appraise, analyse, and summarise the relevant evidence in order to minimise bias. Data was included on multiple individual as well as composite outcomes and further synthesised with meta- analyses in the two included SRs. An- other strength of this HTA is the cost -effectiveness model that was develope d specifically for the Swiss context which was an improvement compared to previous studies for numerous reasons, including ex- tending the time horizon from 10 years to lifetime and updating CVD risk over time, using up- to-date and, when possible, Swiss -spec ific clinical and economic input parameters, based on the AGLA risk scoring system and accompanied with extensive sensitivity analyses. Finally, this HTA provided a com- prehensive overview of the scientific literature on relevant legal, social, ethical, and organisational issues regarding primary prevention of CVD events with statin therapy. Limitations This HTA has several limitations. First, since a large amount of studies is published on statin therapy for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults without established CVD, we chose to include published high-quality SRs instead of individual RCTs. The inclusion of published SRs on efficacy, ef- fectiveness, and safety of primary prevention of CVD with statins with determined data extraction and synthesis is a general limitation, because their choices for objectives, selection criteria, and data syn- thesis are never fully in line with our HTA scope. Furthermore, identified studies were mostly sponsored by the industry. Second, due to limited available data and other limitations, the health economic model represents a simplification of the complex reality of CVD . The main CVD events (MI, stroke, fatal CVD HTA Repo rt 146 events) and its consequences (i.e. revascularization interventions for the treatment of MI) were in cluded in the model, but CVD events such as revascularization for coronary artery disease before the occur- rence of a MI or (un)stable angina were not considered. Consequently, the benefits of statin therapy may be higher than reported in this report . Third , the results of this cost -effectiveness analyses in this HTA are not applicable to other risk scoring systems (e.g. SCORE or Framingham) and additional CVD risk factors (such as very high LDL or presence of atherosclerotic plaque) were not taken into account, because CVD risk was solely defined using the AGLA risk scoring system. However, the general con- clusion that statins are more cost -effective in high CVD risk groups, younger age groups, and females will also be applicable to settings that use other CV D risk scoring systems. Fourth, statins were evalu- ated as a class, but since there are differences in efficacy, safety, and drug costs between statins26 they may not be appl icable to individual statins. Finally , the details of secondary events after the first non- fatal CVD event were not modelled explicitly. However, the consequences of a non- fatal CVD event in terms of increased mortality risk , costs, and disutility seen amongst post-MI and post -stroke patients were included in the model . Evidence gaps The following evidence gaps were identified during this HTA . There was no evidence of the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of statin therapy compared to lifestyle adaptations, therefore we could only determine the cost -effectiveness of statin therapy versus no statin therapy. It is unknown whether the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of statin therapy versus no statin therapy is equal across CVD risk groups. Due to the lack of data, we assumed that the relative effectiveness and safety of statin therapy compared to no statin therapy was equal for people with low, medium, and (very) high CVD risk, but more research is needed to deny or confirm this assumption. Another important evidence gap exists regarding the development of the underlying risk factors of CVD (such as blood cholesterol and blood pressure) in the people without established CVD. As a result, CVD risk could only be updated based on age in the cost -effectiveness model . Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the impact of additional increases in CVD risk due to other risk factors on the cost - effectiveness results. There was no clear evidence on positive (e.g. dementia reduction) and negative side effects (i.e. the beforementioned adverse events) of statins and/or the treatment costs of these events in Switzerland , therefore they were not included in the base- case analysis . The scenario and sensitivity analyses showed that statin therapy adherence and dis utility of 'taking a pill every day' had a significant impact on the cost -effectiveness outcomes, but (real -world) evidence on HTA Repo rt 147 these parameters in Switzerland is lacking. In the base -case analysis, treatment adherence was based on a Finnish study as the healthcare system with partly out -of-pocket costs for statins and the 'medical believers' attitude was comparable to Switzerland. Evidence was lacking on the current use of statins for primary prevention of CVD in various CVD risk groups in Switzerland, ther efore the budget impact of restricted reimbursement policies compared to the current unrestricted use of statins in Switzerland could not be determined. Instead, the population- level costs of reimbursement policies assuming all patients will start using st atin therapy with real-world ad- herence was estimated. Due to a lack of age and sex -specific data on the number of patients without CVD, we assumed that the proportion of people eligible for primary prevention of CVD with statin therapy was equal across age and sex groups. However, it is likely that the proportion of patients without CVD is lower in younger and female subgroups. Consequently, we may have underestimated the number of eligible people for primary prevention of CVD in younger age groups and vice versa. Summary This HTA report showed that it can be concluded that statins can prevent CVD events without resulting in many adverse events of statins at a reasonable cost especially in subgroups with an AGLA risk score above 1% . However, the evidence of safety, effectiveness of and adherence to statins in the real -world is limited and the cost -effectiveness of statins is highly dependent on model settings and uncertain input parameters. Furthermore, as there is no data on the current use of statins for primary prevention of CVD events in Switzerland, the cost savings of disinvestment in statins for the national healthcare budget are unclear. 13 Conclusions Sufficient evidence shows that statin therapy prescribed to adults without established CVD is effecti ve in the prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality under study conditions (i.e. efficacy) , but there is limited evidence on safety and effectiveness under real -world settings. Risk scores for CVD were hardly reported in the studies and no stratifi cation of the efficacy , effectiveness, or safety results was available for people with low, medium, or (very) high CVD risk . The health economic analyses were limited by a number of evidence gaps that should be beared in mind when interpreting the results. In summary, f rom a healthcare payers perspective, applying a life- time horizon with discounting, and assuming real -world treatment adherence and no discontinuation due to adverse events, statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD seems to be associated w ith low ICERs compared to no statin therapy in subgroups with an AGLA risk above 1% , especially for those at younger HTA Repo rt 148 age and females . ICERs were higher in subgroups with low CVD risk (expressed in AGLA risk) , older age and in male s. The findings regarding age and sex were in contrast to the findings in previous studies, who found lower ICERs in males and older age groups. This is mainly caused by the application of a lifetime horizon and age- and sex specific increase in CVD risk over time in our study. The various scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses showed that specific assumptions and parameters had a large impact on the outcomes , such as the time horizon, discounting, treatment adherence , effective- ness of statins in reducing CVD events and the cost s of statin therapy. The budget impact of restricted statin reimbursement policies compared to the current unrestricted use of statins in Switzerland could not be determined due to a lack of data on the current use of statins . The annual healthcare costs of reimbursing statin therapy for all patients above 40 years old, regardless of CVD risk, and assuming all eligible people use statins with real-world adherence to statin therapy com- pared to no reimbursement of statins was 934 million CHF. The annual heal thcare costs of statin therapy decreased when reimbursement of statins was restricted to certain age groups and CVD risks . HTA Repo rt 149 14 References 1.

Domain Support for judgement Review authors' judgement Selection bias Random sequence generation Describe the method used to generate the al- location sequence in suffic ient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomised se-quence. Allocation conceal- ment Describe the method used to conceal the al- location sequence in sufficient detail to deter-mine whether intervention allocations could have been foreseen in advance of, or during, enrolment. Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment. Performance bias Blinding of partici- pants and personnel Assessments should be made for each main out- come (or class of out- comes) Describe all measures used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which interventio n a participant received. Provide any information relating to whether the intended blinding was effective. Performance bias due to knowledge of the allocated inter- ventions by participants and per- sonnel during the study. Detection bias Blinding of out come assessment Assess- ments should be made for each main outcome (or class of outcomes) Describe all measures used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. Provide any information relating to whether the in- tended blinding was effective. Detection bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors. Attrition bias Incomplete outcome data Assessments should be made for each main outcome (or class of outcomes) Describe the comp leteness of outcome data for each main outcome, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. State whether attrition and exclusions were re- ported, the numbers in each intervention group (compared with total randomized par-ticipants), reasons for at trition/exclusions where reported, and any re- inclusions in analyses performed by the review authors. Attrition bias due to amount, na- ture or handling of incomplete out- come data. Reporting bias Selective reporting State how the possibility of selecti ve outcome reporting was examined by the review au- thors, and what was found. Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting. Other bias Other sources of bias State any important concerns about bias not addressed in the other domains in the tool. If particular questions/entries were pre-speci- fied in the review's protocol, responses should be provided for each question/entry. Bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table.

Five studies were not chosen as a source for cost data in the model because they provided no information about any relevant unit cost .174-178 Three other studies were excluded because the costs were only reported for a certain subgroup of patients that were not representative for the total populatio n.179- 181 The remaining four studies are discussed in more detail below.

HTA Repo rt 188 Cardiovascular risk scoring system used and cardiovascular risk and risk group were not reported in any of the studies. HTA Repo rt 189 Prevention costs The costs of prevention of CVD using statins in Ito et al. (2011) were composed of daily costs of drug treatment, medical visits, and biological measurements (either total cholesterol only or an 'optimal' set of tests including total and high- density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and creati- nine).182 However, these costs were not used in the model b ecause more recent unit costs for the pri- mary prevention elements were available from SASIS AG Tariffpool88 and TARMED24. CVD event costs: MI and stroke Gasche et al. (2013) report ed costs for the first year after non- fatal MI, costs in subsequent years after non-fatal MI, costs for the first year after non- fatal stroke, and costs in subsequent years after non- fatal stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome in Switzerland.89 These costs are derived from a previ- ous study from the Winterthur Institute of Health Economics who used different sources to estimate the costs of stroke and MI (e.g. literature analy sis, interviews with stakeholders from health care providers and health insurers, and patient databases). Their cost estimates included all follow -up costs of an event in the first year and in each subsequent year, respectively. 89 The follow -up costs include d inpatient and outpatient costs for acute care and rehabilitation. The cost esti mates reported in Gasche et al. were directly applicable to the MI, post -MI, stroke, and post -stroke health states in our model . Ito et al. also report ed costs on MI treatment for the first and subsequent years after MI.89 However, these estimates were not used in the base- case because it was prefer red to derive the costs of MI and strok e from the same source for consistency reasons. Both Pletscher et al.90 and Wieser et al.183 also reported costs on MI treatment in the first year but did not repor t follow -up costs in subsequent years. Therefore Gasche et al. was preferred as the source for MI costs in the base- case analyses. Pletscher et al. also report ed costs on strokes and MI90, but these were not selected for input in the economic model for the following reasons. Costs for stroke were separately reported for patients who were independent, moderately dependent, and totally dependent after stroke without reporting the dis-tribution of patients over these categories. Therefore, it was not possible to calculate a weighted average for treatment of stroke for all patients. The follow -up costs after stroke reported by Pletscher et al. rep- resent the average resources an 80- year old person uses over its av erage remaining lifetime and was 24 https://www.tarmed -browser.ch/de HTA Repo rt 190 therefore not representative for younger persons. Finally, the follow -up costs in subsequent years after MI were not reported in Pletscher et al. Ito et al. also reported costs on MI treatment182, however, these costs were derived from costing studies published before 2009 and are therefore not preferred over the other, more recent, cost estimates iden- tified in the literature search. Adverse eve nt costs None of the included studies in the healthcare costs search reported costs of any of the four adverse events included (i.e. myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, renal dysfunction, and hepatic dysfunction). However, seven of the cost -effectiveness studies that were previously identified in the systematic liter- ature search in the scoping phase of this project included costs of adverse events. Five of the seven studies that report adverse events costs were performed in the US, however considering the large dif- ferences in healthcare system between the US and Switzerland, these costs were not considered rep- resentative for Switzerland. 98,103,105 -107 In Conly et al.111 the costs of rhabdomyolysis in Canada ($78,740) was based on a study with only two case studies. De Vries et al.92 assumed that treatment of myopathy included two general practitioner (GP) visits (\u20ac59.50). In our model, the same assumption was applied using Swiss unit costs for GP visits in our cost -effectiveness analysis. De Vries et al. base the costs of treatment of rhabdomyolysis (\u20ac11,126) on a US cost study.93 Since we could not find any non- US esti- mates for the treatment of rhabdomyolysis, this source was used for rhabdomyolysis costs. No cost estimates for renal and hepatic dysfunction were identified in the cost -effectiveness studies. Costs of (CVD) death Pletscher et al. report ed the healthcare costs of several fatal CVD events, including str oke (CHF 9,799) and MI (CHF 7,207). 90 A weighted average of these healthcare costs based on the proportion of MI and stroke observed in placebo arms of trials on statins was used as a proxy for healthcare costs of all CVD deaths (CHF 8,511). The included studies did not report recent estimates of costs of all -cause mortality. Br\u00e4ndle et al.,91 that was excluded because the cost estimates reported were derived from studies published before 2009, was the only study that reported costs of all -cause mortality and assumed the same healthcare costs for CVD deaths (CHF 4,191). These costs were derived from a study based on a cost -effectiveness model for diabetes management.184 Eight of the cost -effectiveness studies that were identified in the systematic literature search in the scop- ing phase included costs of fatal events or death. Three studies only reported costs of fatal MI or HTA Repo rt 191 stroke.105,106,116 Three of the five studies that report costs of (CVD) death are performed in the US and considering the large differences in healthcare system with Switzerland, these costs were not consid- ered representative for Switzerland.35-37 In the other two studies, the costs of death was based on expert opinion reported in a study published in 1995 and was therefore also not considered a reliable source.92,104 Therefore, the costs of Br\u00e4ndle et al.91 were considered the most relevant cost estimate for input in our economic model.

The search terms are provided in Table 15.8.1 and 15.8.2. A search filter for utilities was added to the clinical search strings regarding cardiovascular disease. In line with the systematic literature search for costs and resource use, the search strings regarding statins were not added in this search because studies reporting utilities after cardiovascular events in patients who are not using statins could also be relevant. The search filter for utilities were based on the search string that was developed by CADTH to identify studies on the health utilities and/or quality of life of patients in Medline and Embase.25 Once again, we omitted search terms that were already included in the preliminary search for cost-effectiveness anal- yses to avoid overlapping studies. Table. 15.8.1. PubMed Swiss:ab,ti Period 01-01-2009 - 17-02-202 0 Hits 446 Results The selection of studies is illustrated in Figure . The references and decisions of the 13 studies that were included in the full -text screening are reported in Table 15.8.6. None of the included for full text screening report any information on utilities for the relevant health states as defined by our model structure. How- ever, one study89 mentioned that the utilities used in their economic model were based on the PLATO study and referred to the study by Nikolic et al. 2013.95 Nikolic et al. use the exact same health states as our model. This study also reported utility values for the general population and utility decrements for all the health states. The utilities and utility decrements from Nikolic et al. are displayed in Table 15.8.3.95 HTA Repo rt 199 Figure 15.8.1. PRISMA flowchart costs on health -related quality of life Table 15.8.3.

A response rate of 52.1% was achieved, totaling 1 ,956 Swiss adults. Table 15.8.4. Swiss General population utilities (EQ -5D)94 15.8.4 shows the results of the study. Table 15.8.4.
