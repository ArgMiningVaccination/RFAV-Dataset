Here are the main ones you might come across. 1. Fibrates Mostly used for lowering triglyceride levels in patients whose levels are very high and could cause pancreatitis. While they have a modest effect on lowering LDL cholesterol (15 to 20 per cent), they have not been shown to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke and aren't recommended as a statin alternative. 2. Plant stanols and sterols There is some evidence that foods containing these stanols and sterols (Such as specially fortified sunflower spreads and yogurt drinks) can lower cholesterol by a modest amount (eight to 12 per cent). However, there is no evidence they reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke and they're not recommended for prescription in the UK. 3. Cholestyramine and other bile acid-binding resins These are relatively old drugs that were used before statins. They are still used occasionally but are no longer recommended for reducing the risk of future heart attacks or strokes. They may cause gastrointestinal side effects and can lead to vitamin deficiencies if used long term. 4. Niacin There is some evidence to show niacin (vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid) can lower 'bad' LDL cholesterol and raise 'good' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but little evidence that it reduces the risk of heart attack or stroke. It commonly causes intense skin flushing and is not recommended as an alternative to statins. 5. Policosanol Extracted from sugarcane wax, policosanol has been reported to lower cholesterol and improve various medical conditions. However, there is little reliable evidence that it works and some studies show no effect at all. 6. Red yeast rice extract (RYRE) This comes from fermentation of a type of yeast found in rice and is sold as a supplement. It appears to lower LDL cholesterol (by 15 to 25 per cent) by working in a similar way to a low dose of a statin. Unlike statins, there is a lack of research into its long-term safety, uncertainty about the best dose and the amount of the active ingredient can vary widely. 7. Natural products There are many products that claim to have a cholesterol-lowering effect, but most are lacking in solid evidence and they are not an alternative to statins. Oats contain a fibre called beta-glucan, which can help lower your cholesterol level if you have 3g or more of it daily, as part of a healthy diet (a 40g serving of porridge oats contains 2g of beta-glucan) but this will not deliver the same "}
