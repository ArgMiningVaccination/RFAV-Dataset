Since then, she has been receiving regular chiropractic adjustments, and has gained a first-hand experience of how the body works. As a result of this personal experience, she has made it her goal to relieve patients of aches and pains through holistic care and lifestyle changes while preventing the need for surgery and medications. Dr. Meredyth McMichael graduated from New York Chiropractic College in 2016 where she received her Doctorate of Chiropractic and Masters of Science in Applied Clinical Nutrition. Her primary focus is to assist the body's natural healing processes by making sure patients' bodies are functioning optimally. She promises to ensure all care is high-quality, affordable, and natural. As a dependable chiropractor, Dr. Meredyth uses Applied Kinesiology (AK) to diagnose and evaluate the chemical, structural, and mental aspects of health. She chooses to use Applied Kinesiology in her practice because it is a noninvasive method to diagnose muscles not functioning properly. Treatment then may include chiropractic adjustments, cranial techniques, clinical nutrition, evaluation to environmental irritants and/or myofascial therapies to restore function and balance to the muscles. Dr. Meredyth received her first chiropractic adjustment at eight years old after experiencing kne...
