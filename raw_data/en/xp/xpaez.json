It is involved in over 300 cellular processes, including those responsible for protein synthesis and ATP utilization. Studies have shown that many people may not consume an optimum amount of magnesium. Why are good digestion and gut health so important? You may not realize it, but at least 70% of your immune system can be found in your gut, where beneficial bacteria work to maintain a balanced environment and keep your body healthy from the inside out. If that balance is upset, it can affect the health of your entire body, which is why maintaining good digestive function should be an integral part of your daily health routine. Taking care of your gut is one of the best ways to support overall wellness. Probiotics can help replenish gut microbes and promote gut balance and overall wellness. How exactly does magnesium help with digestion? During digestion, three primary digestive enzymes turn food into nutrients that can be absorbed and assimilated by the body. Magnesium plays a role in numerous enzymes systems throughout the body. A few of these processes include energy production from protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism.
