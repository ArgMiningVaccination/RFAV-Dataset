Extract of Boswellia oleoresin containing an appropriate amount of boswellic acids can help maintain healthy joint tissue. Top quality Boswellia may do this by addressing the release of leukotrienes. (Leukotrienes are involved in the body's normal inflammation response.) Celery Seed supports healthy joints by supporting the normal function of the kidneys to clear acidic waste products. This means that the waste products do not get deposited in other tissue, such as connective tissue or fluid around the joints, and helps keep the joint healthy. Ginger is also a great support for healthy joints. It may do this by addressing not only the release of leukotrienes, but also the release of prostaglandins.

The antioxidant activity is probably due to the curcuminoids. The Boswellia component is standardized to contain 180 mg of boswellic acids per tablet, and the Turmeric component contains 70.4 mg of curcuminoids per tablet.
