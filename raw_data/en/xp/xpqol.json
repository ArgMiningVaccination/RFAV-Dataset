Our personalized medicine program is using cutting-edge technologies such as organ chips to emulate the human body and learn about diseases and develop novel drugs. We are also translating stem cell replacement therapies into patient clinical trials for a number of human diseases. When this kind of healthcare becomes reality, Cedars-Sinai will be among the first to share its many benefits with patients.
