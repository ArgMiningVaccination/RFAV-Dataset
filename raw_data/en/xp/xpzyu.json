Update from Novo Nordisk on Fiasp\u00ae FlexTouch\u00ae supply - Novo Nordisk UK is aware of a temporary stock shortage of Fiasp\u00ae (fast-acting insulin aspart) FlexTouch\u00ae pre-filled insulin pens in the UK. Other presentations of Fiasp\u00ae are unaffected. - There has been a delay in our next delivery of Fiasp\u00ae FlexTouch\u00ae, which we expect to arrive in a matter of weeks. The shortage is not a consequence of any safety or quality related concern with Fiasp\u00ae FlexTouch\u00ae. - Ensuring a continuous supply that meets the needs of patients and the NHS is of utmost importance for Novo Nordisk and we are engaging with the Department of Health & Social Care on this issue and working hard so that the next delivery arrives as soon as possible in the UK. - During this temporary shortage period, healthcare professionals have the option to consider swapping to a suitable alternative for impacted patients, if deemed clinically appropriate. - We ask that healthcare professionals continue to prescribe in the normal way to ensure stockpiling does not take place. This will allow us to plan our stock levels and to distribute our medicines and treatments in a normal way, so that people can continue to receive their treatment when the shortage is resolved. Medicines Supply Tool - DHSC and NHSE/I have now launched an online [Medicines Supply Tool](https://www.sps.nhs.uk/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sps.nhs.uk%2Fhome%2Ftools%2Fmedicines-supply-tool%2F&reauth=1), which provides up to date information about medicine supply issues. The contents of these MSNs can now be viewed on the Tool. - The Tool also details any changes to resupply dates and updates to the entries. - To access the Tool you will need an NHS email address. Once set up and logged in, you will be able to access it online. "}
