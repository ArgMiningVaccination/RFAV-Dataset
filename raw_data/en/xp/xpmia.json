Once a person finishes active treatment, and they are found to have no evidence of disease, a brand new fight starts. The new struggle is to recover and to do everything possible to prevent the disease from recurring. Many conventional therapies, such as chemotherapies, can remain in the body for an extended period of time after treatment. Once they're no longer needed, it's important to remove these from our bodies, as they may cause deleterious effects. Therefore detoxification, post-treatment, is important. Just as critical in restoration and prevention is understanding what contributed to the development of your cancer in the first place. If there are any lifestyle, genetic, environmental, or other factors that interacted to give cancer the ability to develop in your body (or made your body more hospitable), it's important to understand what they are, and how you can take action to change the terrain. At Naturopathic Specialists, our physicians have the experience and the knowledge to help people with cancer better understand their own cancer 'story'. Through lab testing, and coming to a thorough understanding of your background, we can provide guidance and tailor treatment to get your life back on track after conventional treatment ends. People who have gone through a cancer battle need support. We help people to continue to be proactive about their health in order to recover from and maximize their efforts to prevent cancer recurrence. While no one can offer a guarantee that cancer will be gone for good, we wholeheartedly support taking every action to prevent cancer from coming back. If you're interested in taking positive steps toward continued recovery and limiting the risk of recurrence, please [schedule a consultation](/contact-us) with one of our physicians. Detox Plan For a while now, 'detox' has been a 'hot-topic' in the health industry. In some cases, detoxification may be a bad thing, for example, if you're undergoing chemotherapy, you wouldn't want to 'detox' your chemotherapy drug and stop it from having its full effect in your cancer treatment. At Naturopathic Specialists, we not only understand when, but how, and why to safely implement a detoxification program so that it is actually beneficial. To that end, we have developed a 28-day detox plan. Over the course of a month, our plan jumpstarts detoxification and contains everything you need to help you detoxify your body. It's also likely that over the course of the month that you are on the plan, you'll pick up some new healthy habits that will stay with you long after the program ends. Part of the program contains a dietary protocol meant to enhance detoxification and explains what foods to eat and not to eat to lower your toxic burden. The plan contains a supplement regimen that can aid your body's detoxification pathways. It also contains a lifestyle guide on how to avoid exposure to toxins in your home and other aspects of your life. As part of the plan, you will undergo therapies, such as IV therapy, that will help rid your body of toxins and support its natural detoxification pathways. A consultation with one of our doctors is required to go through the plan with you and get you started. If you feel like you could benefit from detoxifying or would like information on how to avoid exposure to toxins [contact our clinic](/contact-us) today. Constitutional Hydrotherapy The use of water as a therapeutic modality stretches back thousands of years. Hydrotherapy is the application of hot and cold wet towels to the abdomen, chest, and back with the use of sine wave electrical stimulation. The process of alternating hot and cold has multiple physiological effects on the body. The benefits of hydrotherapy include: Increase circulation of the blood and lymph Increase nutrition to cells Increase the removal of drugs and their metabolites Speed healing and recovery Relieve pain Increase white blood cell counts Decrease inflammation Decrease stress by promoting relaxation Improve hormonal function Hydrotherapy is a widely used and gentle therapy, but there are contraindications to its use. A consultation with one of our doctors is required to determine if hydrotherapy would be safe and effective for you. For more information, please [contact our office](/contact-us) to speak with one of our physicians. Body Composition Testing Obesity increases the risk of developing cancer by 1.6x. It does so by: Increasing inflammation Suppressing the immune system Raising estrogen levels Causing insulin resistance, and more. Obesity also leads to the development of more aggressive forms of cancer and increased rates of recurrence. Using BMI to gauge body fat percentage is not a reliable measure of either body fat as a whole, or more importantly, visceral fat levels. Visceral fat is the fat in your abdominal region, which sits behind your abdominal musculature and around your internal organs. Though it's impossible to see with the naked eye, higher levels of visceral fat are associated with increased rates of cancer. Even people who have a 'normal' BMI and may not appear to be in the overweight/ obese category may have higher levels of visceral fat. To get accurate measurements for our patients, we use the InBody system to analyze body composition and provide both the overall percent body fat and visceral fat levels. Body composition gives us a way to get an overview of a patients' body fat percentage, their muscle mass, intracellular and extracellular water and the levels of inflammation in their body. From our their body composition test, we can also determine how many calories they should be consuming. We use these metrics to track our patients before, during, and after treatment. This in-depth understanding helps us individualize treatment plans to fit each person. If you would like to undergo body composition testing please contact our clinic in association with a cancer treatment, or just to understand what your overall levels are, please [contact our clinic](/contact-us). Chelation Therapy Chelation is often used to remove lead, mercury, arsenic, and other heavy metals from the body. These substances are carcinogens and can cause inflammation, DNA damage, and promote tumor growth when they build up in the body, therefore, removing them is essential to optimal health. In our clinic, chelation therapy is either done through the use of infusion or through oral medications. Common chelating agents are EDTA and DMPS. These chelating agents bind to heavy metals, toxins, and other compounds in such a way that the body can eliminate them. Chelation can be used to help prevent the development of cancer, or can be used after cancer therapy is completed in order to remove toxins from the body and maximize efforts to prevent recurrence. Exposure to chemicals in the environment (at work, home, or otherwise), as well as some medical treatments themselves, may cause harmful compounds to build up faster than the body can eliminate them. These compounds can become 'stuck' in the body. Lingering and collecting, without any way for the body to remove them. Testing is required to determine what chemicals are present in your body that chelation would address. If it is determined that you would benefit from chelation therapy, your physician will decide what type of chelation you need and how long you need it for. Chelation also can strip beneficial minerals from your body, so these must be replenished during treatment in order to maintain your health. Always follow your doctor's direction while on any chelation therapy. If you believe you could benefit from chelation therapy please contact our clinic to [schedule a consultation](/contact-us) with one of our physicians. "}
