Eur Respir J 2022; in press: 2200879 [DOI: 10.1183/13993003.00879-2022]. 1. Preamble Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence, with the aim of assisting health professionals inproposing the best management strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines andtheir recommendations should facilitate decision-making of health professionals in their daily practice.However, guidelines are not a substitute for the patient 's relationship with their practitioner. The final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s), basedon what they consider to be the most appropriate in the circumstances. These decisions are made inconsultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate. Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals. To ensure that all physicians have access to the most recent recommendations, both the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Respiratory Society(ERS) make their guidelines freely available in their own journals. The ESC and ERS warn non-medicalreaders that the technical language may be misinterpreted and decline any responsibility in this respect. Many Guidelines have been issued in recent years by the ESC and ERS. Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to makeall decisions transparent to the user. The ERS and ESC guidance and procedure to formulate and issueclinical practice recommendations can be found on the societies 'relevant website or journal (https://www. escardio.org/Guidelines and https://openres.ersjournals.com/content/8/1/00655-2021). The ESC and ERSGuidelines represent the official position of the ESC and ERS on a given topic and are regularly updated. The panel of experts of these specific guidelines comprised an equal number of ERS and ESC members, including representatives from relevant subspecialty groups involved in the medical care of patients with this pathology. The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interestwere reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and can be found on the ESC website(http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines). They have been compiled in a report and co-published in asupplementary document of the guidelines. This process ensures transparency and prevents potential biasesin the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of interest that arose during thewriting period were notified to the ESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial supportfrom the ESC and ERS without any involvement from the health care industry. The ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee and the ERS Guidelines Director reporting to the ERS Science Council supervise and co-ordinate the preparation of new guidelines. These Guidelinesunderwent extensive review by the ESC CPG Committee, the ERS Guidelines Working Group, andexternal experts. The guidelines were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medicalknowledge and the evidence available at the time of drafting. After appropriate revisions, the guidelineswere signed off by all the experts in the Task Force. The finalized document was signed off by the ESCCPG Committee and endorsed by the ERS Executive Committee before being simultaneously published intheEuropean Heart Journal (EHJ) and the European Respiratory Journal (ERJ). The decision to publish the guidelines in both journals was made to ensure adequate dissemination of the recommendations in boththe cardiology and respiratory fields.Copyright \u00a9 the European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society 2022.

HUMBERT ET AL.The task of developing the ESC/ERS Guidelines also included creating educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations, including condensed pocket guidelines versions,summary slides, a lay summary, and an electronic version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.).These versions are abridged and thus, for more detailed information, the user should always access thefull-text version of the guidelines, which is freely available via the ESC and ERS websites, and hosted onthe EHJ and ERJ websites. The National Cardiac Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, adopt,translate, and implement all ESC Guidelines. Pulmonary national societies are also encouraged to sharethese guidelines with their members and develop a summary or editorials in their own language, ifappropriate. Implementation programmes are needed because it has been shown that the outcome ofdisease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations. Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC/ERS Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well as in determining and implementing preventive, diagnostic, or therapeuticmedical strategies. However, the ESC/ERS Guidelines do not override, in any way, the individualresponsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in considering eachpatient 's health condition and in consulting with that patient or the patient 's caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional 's responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time of prescription and, where appropriate, to respect the ethicalrules of their profession in each country. Off-label use of medication may be presented in these guidelines if a sufficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically appropriate to a given condition and if patients could benefit from therecommended therapy. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by theresponsible health professional, giving special consideration to: \u0081The specific situation of the patient. In this respect, it is specified that, unless otherwise provided for by national regulations, off-label use of medication should be limited to situations where it is in thepatient 's interest to do so, with regards to the quality, safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has been fully informed and provided consent. \u0081Country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which health professionals are subject, where applicable.BOX 1 Continued SCD Sickle cell disease sGC dioxide VKA Vitamin K antagonist VO2 Oxygen uptake VO2/HR Oxygen pulse VTE Venous thrombo-embolismWHO-FC World Health Organization functional class WSPH World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension WU Wood units https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 8EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.2. Introduction Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a pathop hysiological disorder that may inv olve multiple clinic al conditions and may be associated with a variety of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The complexity of managing PHrequires a multifaceted, holistic, and multidisciplinar y approach, with active involvement of patients with PH in partnership with clinicians. Streamlining the care of pa tients with PH in daily clinical practice is a challenging but essential requirement for effectively managing PH. In recent years, substantial progress has been made indetecting and managing PH, and new e vidence has been timeously integrat ed in this fourth edition of the ESC/ ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and t reatment of pulmonary hy pertension. Reflecting the multidisciplinary input into managing patients with PH and interpreting new evidence, the Task Force included cardiologists andpneumologists, a thoracic surgeon, methodologists, and patients. These comprehensive clinical practiceguidelines cover the whole spectrum of PH, with an emphasis on diagnosing and treating pulmonary arterialhypertension (PAH) and chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). 2.1. What is new One of the most important proposals from the 6th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH)was to reconsider the haemodynamic definition of PH [1]. After careful evaluation, the new definitions ofPH have been endorsed and expanded in these guidelines, including a revised cut-off level for pulmonaryvascular resistance (PVR) and a definition of exercise PH. The classification of PH has been updated, including repositioning of vasoreactive patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and a revision of group 5 PH, including repositioning of PH inlymphangioleiomyomatosis in group 3. Concerning the diagnosis of PH, a new algorithm has been developed aiming at earlier detection of PH in the community. In addition, expedited referral is recommended for high-risk or complex patients.Screening strategies are also proposed. The risk-stratification table has been expanded to inc lude additional echocardiogr aphic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) prognostic indicators. The r ecommendations for initial d rug therapies have been simplified, building on this revised, three-strata, multipar ametric risk model to replace functional classification. At follow-up, a four-strata risk-assessment tool is now proposed based on refined cut-off levels for World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC), intermediate -high, or high risk. The PAH treatment algorithm has been modified, highlighting the importance of cardiopulmonary comorbidities, risk assessment both at diagnosis and follow-up, and the importance of combinationtherapies. Treatment strategies during follow-up have been based on the four-strata model intended tofacilitate more granular decision-making. The recommendations for managing PH associated with left heart disease (PH-LHD) and lung disease have been updated, including a new haemodynamic definition of severe PH in patients with lung disease. In group 4 PH, the term chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) with or without PH has been introduced, acknowledging the presence of similar symptoms, perfusion defects, and organized fibroticobstructions in patients with or without PH at rest. Interventional treatment by balloon pulmonary angioplasty(BPA) in combination with medical therapy has been upgraded in the therapeutic algorithm of CTEPH. New standards for PH centres have been presented and, for the first time, patient representatives were actively involved in developing these guidelines. Questions with direct consequences for clinical practiti oners regarding each PH classification subgroup were selected and addressed, name ly guidance on: initial treatment strategy for group 1 PH (Population, Intervention, Control, Outcome [PICO] I); use of oral phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5is) for the treatment of group 2PH (PICO II); use of oral PDE5is for the treatment of group 3 PH (PICO III); and use of PH drugs prior toBPA for the treatment of group 4 PH (PICO IV). These questions were considered to be important because:most contemporary PH registries describe variable use of initial oral monotherapy and combination therapy;large case series show widespread use of PDE5is in group 2 PH, despite a class III recommendation in the2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension; large case series showwidespread use of PDE5is in group 3 PH, despite a class III recommendation in the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelinesfor the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension; and there is no clear guidance for therapy with PHdrugs in patients with inoperable CTEPH prior to BPA. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 9EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M.

Methods Three main methodological approaches were used in these guidelines, depending on the type of questionsaddressed:i) Four questions that were considered highly important were formulated in the PICO format, and assessed with full systematic reviews and application of the Grading of Recommendations,Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach [2] and the Evidence to Decision(EtD) framework [3] (see Supplementary Data, Section 2.1 for full methodology description andsupportive material). The resulting recommendations were rated as strong or conditional, based on fourpotential levels of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low; Tables 1 and 2). All Task Forcemembers approved the recommendations. In addition, these recommendations were also presented andvoted following the usual ESC approach. ii) Eight questions that were considered of key importance (key narrative questions) were assessed with systematic literature searches and application of the EtD framework [6]. The evidence grading wasperformed following the usual ESC approach. iii) The remaining topics of interest were assessed using the process commonly followed in ESC Guidelines. Structured literature searches were undertaken and grading tables, as outlined in Tables 3and 4, were created to describe level of confidence in the recommendation provided and the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation. The Task Force discussed each draft recommendation during web-based conference calls dedicated to specific sections, followed by consensus modificationsand an online vote on each recommendation. Only recommendations that were supported by at least75% of the Task Force members were included in the guidelines. The recommendation tables werecolour-coded for ease of interpretation.

HUMBERT ET AL.3. Definitions and classifications 3.1. Definitions The definitions for PH are based on haemodynamic assessment by right heart catheterization (RHC). Although haemodynamics represent the central element of characterizing PH, the final diagnosis andclassification should reflect the whole clinical context and consider the results of all investigations. Pulmonary hypertension is defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) >20 mmHg at rest (Table 5). This is supported by studies assessing the upper limit of normal pulmonary arterial pressure(PAP) in healthy subjects [7 -9], and by studies investigating the prognostic relevance of increased PAP (key narrative question 1, Supplementary Data, Section 3.1) [10 -12]. It is essential to include PVR and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) in the definition of pre-capillary PH, in order to discriminate elevated PAP due to pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) fromthat due to left heart disease (LHD), elevated pulmonary blood flow, or increased intrathoracic pressure(Table 5). Based on the available data, the upper limit of normal PVR and the lowest prognosticallyrelevant threshold of PVR is 2 Wood units (WU) [7, 8, 13, 14].

HUMBERT ET AL.best threshold for PAWP discriminating pre- and post-capillary PH are contradictory. Although the upper limit of normal PAWP is considered to be 12 mmHg [15], previous ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosisand treatment of PH, as well as the recent consensus recommendation of the ESC Heart FailureAssociation [16], suggest a higher threshold for the invasive diagnosis of heart failure (HF) with preservedejection fraction (HFpEF) (PAWP 15 mmHg). In addition, almost all therapeutic studies of PAH have used the PAWP 15 mmHg threshold. Therefore, it is recommended keeping PAWP 15 mmHg as the threshold for pre-capillary PH, while acknowledging that any PAWP threshold is arbitrary and that thepatient phenotype, risk factors, and echocardiographic findings, including left atrial (LA) volume, need tobe considered when distinguishing pre- from post-capillary PH. Patients with PAH are haemodynamically characterized by pre-capillary PH in the absence of other causes of pre-capillary PH, such as CTEPH and PH associated with lung diseases. All PH groups may compriseboth pre- and post-capillary components contributing to PAP elevation. In particular, older patients maypresent with several conditions predisposing them to PH. The primary classification should be based onthe presumed predominant cause of the pulmonary pressure increase. Post-capillary PH is haemodynamically defined >15 mmHg. Pulmonary vascular resistance is used to differentiate between patients with post-capillary PH who have a significant pre-capillary component (PVR >2 WU \u2014combined post- and (PVR 2W U \u2014isolated post-capillary PH [IpcPH]). There mPAP (>20 mmHg) but low PVR ( 2 WU) and low PAWP ( 15 mmHg). These patients are frequently characterized by elevated pulmonary blood flow and, although they have PH,they do not fulfil the criteria of pre- or post-capillary PH. This haemodynamic condition may be describedby the term 'unclassified PH '. Patients with unclassified PH may present with congenital heart disease (CHD), liver disease, airway disease, lung disease, or hyperthyroidism explaining their mPAP elevation.Clinical follow-up of these patients is generally recommended. In the case of elevated pulmonary bloodflow, its aetiology should be explored. As the groups of PH according to clinical classification represent different clinical conditions, there may be additional clinically relevant haemodynamic thresholds ( e.g. for PVR) for the individual PH groups besides the general thresholds of the haemodynamic definition of PH, which are discussed in thecorresponding sections. Exercise PH, defined by an mPAP/cardiac output (CO) slope >3 mmHg/L/min between rest and exercise [17], has been re-introduced. The mPAP/CO slope is strongly age dependent and its upper limit of normalranges from 1.6 -3.3 mmHg/L/min in the supine mPAP/CO mmHg/L/min is not physiological in subjects aged <60 years and may rarely be present in healthy subjects aged >60 years[17]. A pathological increase in pulmonary pressure during exercise is associated with impaired prognosisin patients with exercise dyspnoea [18] and in several cardiovascular conditions [19 -22]. Although an increased mPAP/CO slope defines an abnormal haemodynamic response to exercise, it does not allow fordifferentiation between pre- and post-capillary causes. The PAWP/CO slope with a threshold >2 mmHg/L/min may best differentiate between pre- and post-capillary causes of exercise PH [23, 24]. 3.2. Classifications The basic structure of the classification from the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis andtreatment of PH [25, 26] and the Proceedings of the 6th WSPH [1] has been kept (Table 6). The generalpurpose of the clinical classification of PH remains to categorize clinical conditions associated with PH,based on similar pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical presentation, haemodynamic characteristics, andtherapeutic management (Figure 1). The main changes are as follows:i) The subgroups 'non-responders at vasoreactivity testing 'and 'acute responders at vasoreactivity testing 'have been added to IPAH as compared with the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH [25, 26]. In addition to patients with IPAH, some patients with heritable PAH(HPAH) or drug- or toxin-associated PAH (DPAH) might be acute responders. ii) The groups 'PAH with features of of the newborn (PPHN) ' have been included in group 1 (PAH) as compared with the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for thediagnosis and treatment of PH and in line with the Proceedings of the 6th WSPH [1]. iii) Instead of the general term 'sleep-disordered breathing ', the term 'hypoventilation syndromes 'should be used within group 3 to describe conditions with increased risk of PH. Sole nocturnal obstructive https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 21EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.sleep apnoea is generally not a cause of PH, but PH is frequent in patients with hypoventilation syndromes causing daytime hypercapnia. 4. Epidemiology and risk factors Pulmonary hypertension is a major global health issue. All age groups are affected. Present estimatessuggest a PH prevalence of 1% of the global population. Due to the presence of cardiac and pulmonary causes of PH, prevalence is higher in individuals aged >65 years [29]. Globally, LHD is the leading causeof PH [29]. Lung disease, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is the second mostcommon cause [29]. In the UK, the observed PH prevalence has doubled in the last 10 years and iscurrently 125 cases/million inhabitants [30]. Irrespective of the underlying condition, developing PH isassociated with worsening symptoms and increased mortality [29].

Group 1, pulmonary arterial hypertension Recent registry data from economically developed countries indicate a PAH incidence and prevalence of6 and 48 -55 cases/million adults, respectively [31]. It has been thought to predominantly affect younger individuals, mostly females [32, 33]; this is currently true for HPAH, which affects twice as many femalesas males. However, recent data from the USA and Europe suggest that PAH is now frequently diagnosedin older patients ( i.e.those aged 65 years, who often present with cardiovascular comorbidities, resulting in a more equal distribution between sexes) [32]. In most PAH registries, IPAH was the most commonsubtype (50 -60% of all cases), followed by PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD), CHD, and portal hypertension (porto-pulmonary hypertension [PoPH]) [32]. A number of drugs and toxins are associated with the development of PAH [1, 34 -45]. The association between exposure to drugs and toxins and PAH is classified as definite or possible, as proposed at the 6thWSPH (Table 7) [1]. There is a definite association with drugs, with available data based on outbreaks,epidemiological case-control studies, or large multicentre series. A possible association is suggested bymultiple case series or cases with drugs with similar mechanisms of action [1]. 4.2. Group 2, pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease In 2013, the Global Burden of Disease Study reported 61.7 million cases of HF worldwide, whichrepresented almost a doubling since 1990 [46]. In Europe and the USA, >80% of patients with HF areaged65 years. Post-capillary PH, either isolated or combined with a pre-capillary component, is a frequent complication mainly in HFpEF, affecting at least 50% of these patients [47, 48]. The prevalenceof PH increases with severity of left-sided valvular diseases, and PH can be found in 60 -70% of patients with severe and symptomatic mitral valve disease [49] and in up to 50% of those with symptomatic aorticstenosis [50]. 4.3. Group 3, pulmonary hypertension associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxia Mild PH is common in advanced parenchymal and interstitial lung disease. Studies have reported that 1- 5% of patients with advanced COPD with chronic respiratory failure or candidates for lung volumereduction surgery or lung transplantation (LTx) have an 25 mmHg has been reported in 8 -15% of patients upon initial work-up, with greater prevalence in advanced (30 -50%) and end-stage (>60%) disease [52]. Hypoxia is a public health problem for the estimated 120 million people living at altitudes >2500 m. Altitude dwellers are atrisk of developing PH and chronic mountain sickness. However, it remains unclear to what extent PH andTABLE 7 Drugs and toxins associated with pulmonary artery hypertension Definite association Possible C virus (sofosbuvir)Toxic rapeseed oil Indirubin (Chinese herb Qing-Dai) L-tryptophan PhenylpropanolaminePonatinibSelective veno-occlusive disease. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 24EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.right HF are public health problems in high-altitude communities; this should be addressed with updated methodology and large-scale population studies [53]. 4.4. Group 4, pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic pulmonary artery obstruction The number of patients diagnosed with CTEPH is increasing, probably due to a deeper understanding ofthe disease and more active screening for this condition in patients who remain dyspnoeic after pulmonaryembolism (PE) or who have risk factors for developing CTEPH. Registry data indicate a CTEPH incidenceand prevalence of 2 -6 and 26 -38 cases/million adults, respectively [31, 54, 55]. Patients with chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) without PH still represent a small proportion of the patientsreferred to CTEPH centres [56]. 4.5. Group 5, pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms Group 5 PH consists of a complex group of disorders that are associated with PH [57]. The cause is oftenmultifactorial and can be secondary to increased pre- and post-capillary pressure, as well as direct effectson pulmonary vasculature. The incidence and prevalence of PH in most of these disorders are unknown.However, high-quality registries have recently enabled estimation of PH prevalence in adult patients withsarcoidosis [58, 59]. Studies suggest that PH can be common and its presence is often associated withincreased morbidity and mortality [58, 59]. 5. Pulmonary hypertension diagnosis 5.1. DiagnosisThe diagnostic approach to PH is mainly focused on two tasks. The primary goal is to raise early suspicionof PH and ensure fast-track referral to PH centres in patients with a high likelihood of PAH, CTEPH, orother forms of severe PH. The second objective is to identify underlying diseases, especially LHD (group2 PH) and lung disease (group 3 PH), as well as comorbidities, to ensure proper classification, riskassessment, and treatment. 5.1.1. Clinical presentation Symptoms of PH are mainly linked to right ventricle (RV) dysfunction, and typically associated withexercise in the earlier course of the disease [25, 26]. The cardinal symptom is dyspnoea on progressivelyminor exertion. Other common symptoms are related to the stages and severity of the disease, and arelisted in Figure 2 [60 -62]. Potential clinical signs and physical findings are summarized in Figure 3 [60, 61]. Importantly, the physical examination may also be the key to identifying the underlying cause of PH(see Figure 3). 5.1.2. Electrocardiogram Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (Table 8) may raise suspicion of PH, deliver prognostic information, and detect arrhythmias and signs of LHD. In adults with clinical suspicion of PH ( e.g. unexplained dyspnoea on exertion), right axis deviation has a high predictive value for PH [63]. A normalECG does not exclude the presence of PH, but a normal ECG in combination with normal biomarkers(BNP/NT-proBNP) is associated with a low likelihood of PH in patients referred for suspected PH or atrisk of PH ( radiography presents abnormal findings in most patients with PH; however, a normal chest X-raydoes not exclude PH [68]. Radiographic signs of PH include a characteristic configuration of the cardiacsilhouette due to right heart (right atrium [RA]/RV) and PA enlargement, sometimes with pruning of theperipheral vessels. In addition, signs of the underlying cause of PH, such as LHD or lung disease, may befound (Table 9) [25, 60, 69, 70]. 5.1.4. Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and analysis of arterial blood gas (ABG) or arterialized capillary bloodare necessary to distinguish between PH groups, assess comorbidities and the need for supplementaryoxygen, and determine disease severity. The initial work-up of patients with suspected PH shouldcomprise forced spirometry, body plethysmography, lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO),and ABG. In patients with PAH, PFTs are usually normal or may show mild restrictive, obstructive, or combined abnormalities [71, 72]. More severe PFT abnormalities are occasionally found in patients with PAHassociated with CHD [73], and those with group 3 PH. The DLCO may be normal in patients with PAH,although it is usually mildly reduced [71]. A severely reduced DLCO (<45% of the predicted value) in the https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 25EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.presence of otherwise normal PFTs can be found in PAH associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc), PVOD, in PH group 3 \u2014associated with emphysema, interstitial lung disease (ILD), or combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema \u2014and in some PAH phenotypes [74]. A low DLCO is associated with a poor prognosis in several forms of PH [75 -78]. Patients with PAH usually have normal or slightly reduced partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2). Severe reduction of PaO 2might raise suspicion for patent foramen ovale, hepatic disease, with right-to-left shunt defect), or low-DLCO-associated conditions. Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) is typically lower than normal due to alveolar hyperventilation [79]. Low PaCO 2at diagnosis and follow-up is common in PAH and associated with unfavourable outcomes [80]. Elevated PaCO 2is very unusual in PAH and reflects alveolar hypoventilation, which in itself may be a cause of PH. Overnight oximetry or polysomnography should be performed ifthere is suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing or hypoventilation [81]. 5.1.5. Echocardiography Independent of the underlying aetiology, PH leads to RV pressure overload and dysfunction, which can bedetected by echocardiography [82 -84]. When performed accurately, echocardiography provides FIGURE 2 Symptoms in patients with pulmonary hypertension. WHO-FC, World Health Organization functional class.aThoracic compression syndromes are found in a minority of patients with PAH with pronounced dilation of the pulmonary artery, and may occur at any disease stage and even in patients with otherwise mildfunctional impairment. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 26EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M.

HUMBERT ET AL.comprehensive information on right and left heart morphology, RV and LV function, and valvular abnormalities, and gives estimates of haemodynamic parameters. Echocardiography is also a valuable tool with which to detect the cause of suspected or confirmed PH, particularly with respect to PH associated with LHD or CHD. Yet, echocardiography alone is insufficient to confirm a diagnosis of PH, whichrequires RHC. Given the heterogeneous nature of PH and the peculiar geometry of the RV, there is no single echocardiographic parameter that reliably informs about PH status and underlying aetiology. Therefore, acomprehensive echocardiographic evaluation for suspected PH includes estimating the systolic pulmonaryarterial pressure (sPAP) and detecting additional signs suggestive of PH, aiming at assigning anechocardiographic level of probability of PH. Echocardiographic findings of PH, including estimatingpressure and signs of RV overload and/or dysfunction, are summarized in Figure 4. Estimates of sPAP are based on the peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity the \u2014after excluding pulmonary stenosis \u2014taking into account non-invasive estimates of RA pressure (RAP). Considering the inaccuracies in estimating RAP and theamplification of measurement errors by using derived variables [85 -87], these guidelines recommend using the peak TRV (and not the estimated sPAP) as the key variable for assigning the echocardiographicprobability of PH. A peak TRV >2.8 m/s may suggest PH; however, the presence or absence of PH cannotbe reliably determined by TRV alone [88]. Lowering the TRV threshold in view of the revisedhaemodynamic definition of PH is not supported by available data (key narrative question 2,Supplementary Data, Section 5.1) [89 -92]. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity may underestimate ( e.g. in patients with severe TR) [28] or overestimate ( e.g.in patients with high CO in liver disease or sickle cell disease [SCD] [93, 94], misinterpretation of tricuspid valve closure artefact for the TR jet, or incorrectassignment of a peak TRV in the case of maximum velocity boundary artefacts) pressure gradients. Hence,additional variables related to RV morphology and function are used to define the echocardiographicprobability of PH (Table 10) [82 -84, 95], which may then be determined as low, intermediate, or high. When interpreted in a clinical context, this probability can be used to decide the need for furtherinvestigation, including cardiac catheterization in individual patients (Figure 5). Echocardiographic measures of RV function include the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV fractional area change (RV-FAC), RV free-wall strain, and tricuspid annulus velocity (S wave) derived from tissue Doppler imaging, and potentially RV ejection fraction (RVEF) derived from 3Dechocardiography. Furthermore, the TAPSE/sPAP ratio \u2014representing a non-invasive measure of RV -PA coupling [96] \u2014may aid in diagnosing PH [90, 97, 98]. The pattern of RV outflow tract (RVOT) blood flow (mid-systolic 'notching ') may suggest pre-capillary PH [99, 100]. To separate between group 2 PH and other forms of PH, and to assess the likelihood of left ventricle (LV) diastolic dysfunction, LA size and signs of LV hypertrophy should always be measured, and Dopplerechocardiographic signs ( e.g.E/A ratio, E/E ) should be assessed even if the reliability of the latter is considered low [16]. To identify CHD, 2D Doppler and contrast examinations are helpful, butTABLE 9 Radiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension and concomitant abnormalities Signs of PH and concomitant abnormalitiesSigns of left heart disease/ pulmonary congestionSigns of lung disease Right heart enlargement Central air space opacification Flattening peripheral vessels effusions Lung volume loss (fibrotic lung pulmonary disease; PA, pulmonary artery; PH, pulmonary hypertension.aMay be present in patients with PH with advanced right ventricular failure and moderate pericardial effusion. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 28EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY GUIDELINES | M. tomography [CT] angiography, cMRI) are needed in exclude sinus venosus atrial septal defects,patent ductus arteriosus, and/or The clinical value of exerciseDoppler echocardiography in identifying exercise PH remains uncertain because of the lack of validatedcriteria and prospective confirmatory data. In most cases, increases in sPAP during exercise are caused by diastolic LV dysfunction [16]. 5.1.6. Ventilation/perfusion lung scan scan (planar or single-photon emission computed tomography[SPECT]) is recommended in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected or newly diagnosed PH, torule out or detect signs of CTEPH [102, 103]. The V/Q SPECT is superior to planar imaging and is the FIGURE 4 Transthoracic echocardiographic parameters in the assessment of pulmonary hypertension.

HUMBERT ET AL.methodology of choice; however, SPECT has been widely evaluated in assessing PE, but not to the same degree in CTEPH [68]. In the absence of parenchymal lung disease, a normal perfusion scan excludes CTEPH with a negative predicted value of 98% [104, 105]. In most patients with PAH, V/Q signs suggestive >21 mm with decreased inspiratory collapse (<50% with a sniff or <20% with quiet inspiration) Flattening of the RV, AT, assessing the probability of PH in addition to TRV (see Figure 5).

HUMBERT ET AL.is normal or shows a speckled pattern but no typical perfusion defects characteristic of PE or CTEPH, whereas matched V/Q defects may be found in patients with lung disease ( i.e.group 3 PH). Non-matched perfusion defects similar to those seen in CTEPH may be present in 7 -10% of patients with PVOD/PCH or PAH [106, 107]. Deposition of the perfusion agent extrapulmonary organs may hint to cardiac orpulmonary right-to-left shunting and has been angiographyComputed tomography (CT) imaging may provide important information for patients with unexplained dyspnoea or suspected/confirmed PH. The CT signs suggesting the presence of PH include an enlarged PA diameter, a PA-to-aorta ratio >0.9, and enlarged right heart chambers [68]. A combination of threeparameters (PA diameter 30 mm, RVOT wall thickness 6 mm, and septal deviation 140\u00b0 [or RV:LV ratio1]) is highly predictive of PH [108]. Non-contrast chest CT can help determine the cause of PH when there are features of parenchymal lung disease, and may also point towards the presence of PVOD/PCH by showing centrilobular ground-glass opacities (which may also andlymphadenopathy [68]. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is mainly used to detect direct or indirect signs of CTEPH, such as filling defects (including thrombus adhering to the vascular wall), webs or bands in thePAs, PA retraction/dilatation, mosaic perfusion, and enlarged bronchial arteries. Importantly, the diagnosticaccuracy of CTPA for CTEPH is limited (at the patient level, sensitivity and specificity are 76% and 96%,respectively) [109], but was reported to be higher when modern, high-quality multi-detector CT scannerswere used and [109, 110]. Computed tomography pulmonaryangiography may also be used to detect other cardiovascular abnormalities, including intracardiac shunts,abnormal pulmonary venous return, patent ductus arteriosus, and PAVMs. In patients presenting with a clinical picture of acute PE, chest CT may be helpful in detecting signs of hitherto undetected CTEPH, which may include the presence of the above CTEPH signs, and RVhypertrophy as a sign for chronicity [111, 112]. Detecting 'acute on chronic 'PE is important, as it may impact the management of patients with presumed acute PE. Dual-energy CT (DECT) angiography and iodine subtraction mapping may provide additional diagnostic information by creating iodine maps [113], which reflect lung perfusion, thereby possibly increasing thediagnostic accuracy for CTEPH [114]. Although increasingly used, the diagnostic value of DECT in thework-up of patients with PH has not been established. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is mainly used to confirm the diagnosis of CTEPH and to assess treatment options ( i.e.operability or accessibility for BPA). Most centres use conventional two- or three-planar DSA. However, C-arm CT imaging may provide a higher spatial resolution, potentiallyidentifying more target vessels for BPA and providing procedural guidance [115, 116]. 5.1.8. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging accurately and reproducibly assesses atrial and ventricular size,morphology, and function. Additional RV/LV myocardial strain can be obtained byapplying tagging or by post-processing feature tracking. In addition, cMRI can be used to measure bloodflow in the PA, aorta, and vena stroke volume (SV), intracardiac shunt, andretrograde flow. By combining contrast magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and pulmonary perfusionimaging with late gadolinium-enhancement imaging of the myocardium, a complete picture of the heartand pulmonary vasculature can be obtained (see Supplementary Data, Table S2 for cMRI indices andnormal values). A limitation is that there is no established method with which to estimate PAP. Eventhough the cost and availability of the technique precludes its use in the early diagnosis of PAH, it issensitive in detecting early signs of PH and diagnosing CHD [117]. 5.1.9. Blood tests and immunology The initial diagnostic assessment of patients with newly diagnosed PH/PAH aims to identify comorbiditiesand possible causes or complications of PH. Laboratory tests that should be obtained at the time of PHdiagnosis include: blood counts (including haemoglobin [Hb]); serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium);kidney function (creatinine, BNP or https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.NT-proBNP. In addition, serological studies should include testing for hepatitis viruses and HIV. Basic immunology laboratory work-up is recommended, including screening tests for anti-nuclear antibodies,anti-centromere antibodies, and anti-Ro. Screening for biological markers of antiphospholipid syndrome isrecommended in patients with CTEPH. Additional thrombophilia screening is not generally recommended,unless therapeutic consequences are to be expected [118]. Pulmonary arterial hypertension and other formsof severe PH can be associated with thyroid function disorders; hence, laboratory screening should includeat least thyroid-stimulating hormone. 5.1.10. Abdominal ultrasound An abdominal ultrasound examination should be part of the comprehensive diagnostic work-up of patientswith newly diagnosed PH, particularly if liver disease is suspected. A major objective is to search for liverdisease and/or portal hypertension, or portocaval shunt (Abernethy malformation). During the course of the disease, patients with PH may develop secondary organ dysfunction mainly affecting the liver and kidneys [119]. In these patients, abdominal ultrasound is needed for differential diagnostic reasons and toassess the extent of organ damage. 5.1.11. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a useful tool to assess the underlying pathophysiologicmechanisms leading to exercise intolerance. Patients with PAH show a typical pattern, with a low end-tidalpartial pressure of carbon dioxide (P ETCO2), high ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO 2), low oxygen pulse (VO 2/HR), and low peak oxygen uptake (VO 2) [120]. These findings should prompt consideration of PVD. In patients with LHD or COPD, such a pattern may indicate an additionalpulmonary vascular limitation [121, 122]. In populations at risk of PAH, such as those with SSc, a normalpeak VO 2seems to exclude the diagnosis of PAH [123]. 5.1.12. Right heart catheterization, vasoreactivity, exercise, and fluid challenge 5.1.12.1. Right heart catheterizationRight heart catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosing and classifying PH. Performing RHCrequires expertise and meticulous methodology following standardized protocols. In addition to diagnosingand classifying PH, clinical indications include haemodynamic assessment of heart or LTx candidates[124] and evaluating congenital cardiac shunts. Interpreting invasive haemodynamics should be done inthe context of the clinical picture and other diagnostic investigations. When performed in PH centres, thefrequencies of serious adverse events (1.1%) and procedure-related mortality (0.055%) are low [125].A known thrombus or tumour in the RV or RA, recently implanted (<1 month) pacemaker, mechanicalright heart valve, TriClip, and an acute infection are contraindications to RHC; the risk:benefit ratio shouldbe individually assessed before each examination and discussed with the patient. The most feared complication of RHC is perforation of a PA. The adequate preparation of patients for RHC is of major relevance. Pre-existing medical conditions should be optimally controlled at the time of the examination (particularly blood pressure and volume control). Inthe supine position, the mid-thoracic level is recommended as the zero reference level, which is at the levelof the LA in most patients [126]. For a complete assessment of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics, all measures listed in Table 11 must be measured or calculated. Incomplete assessments must be avoided, as this may lead to misdiagnosis. As aminimum, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2) and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) should be determined. A stepwise assessment of oxygen saturation should be performed in patients with SvO 2>75% and whenever a left-to-right shunt is suspected. Cardiac output (CO) should be assessed by the direct Fickmethod or thermodilution (mean values of at least three measurements). The indirect Fick method isconsidered to be less reliable than thermodilution [127]; however, thermodilution should not be used in thepresence of shunts. Pulmonary vascular resistance ([mPAP PAWP]/CO) should be calculated for each patient. All pressure measurements, including PAWP, should be performed at end expiration (withoutbreath-holding manoeuvre). In patients with large intrathoracic pressure changes during the respiratorycycle ( i.e.COPD, obesity, during exercise), it is appropriate to average over at least three to four respiratory cycles. If no reliable PAWP curve can be obtained, or if the PAWP values are implausible,additional measurement of LV end-diastolic pressure should be considered to avoid misclassification.Saturations taken with the catheter in the wedged position can confirm an accurate PAWP [128]. 5.1.12.2. Vasoreactivity testing The purpose of vasoreactivity testing in PAH is to identify acute vasoresponders who may be candidatesfor treatment with high-dose calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Pulmonary vasoreactivity testing is only https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 32EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET in patients with IPAH, HPAH, [129] or inhaled [130, 131] are the recommended test compounds for vasoreactivity testing (Table 12). There is similar evidencefor intravenous (i.v.) epoprostenol, but due to incremental dose increases and repetitive measurements,testing takes much longer and is therefore less feasible [129]. Adenosine i.v. is no longer recommendeddue to frequent side effects [132]. A positive acute response is defined as a reduction in mPAP by 10 mmHg to reach an absolute value 40 mmHg, with increased or unchanged CO [129]. In patients with PH-LHD, vasoreactivity testing is restricted to evaluating heart transplantation candidacy (see Section8.1), and in patients with PH in the context of CHD with initial systemic-to-pulmonary shunting,vasoreactivity testing can be performed to evaluate the possibility of defect closure (see Section 7.5) [101]. 5.1.12.3. Exercise right heart catheterization Right heart catheterization is the gold standard method to assess cardiopulmonary haemodynamics duringexercise and to define exercise PH [133]. The main reason to perform exercise RHC is to investigatepatients with unexplained dyspnoea and normal resting haemodynamics in order to detect early PVD orleft heart dysfunction. In addition, exercise haemodynamics may reveal important prognostic andfunctional information in patients at risk of PAH and CTEPH [22, 134, 135]. To maximize the amount ofinformation, exercise RHC may be combined with CPET. According to the available data and experience,TABLE 11 Haemodynamic measures obtained during right heart catheterization Normal value Measured variables Right atrial pressure, mean (RAP) 2 -6 mmHg Pulmonary artery pressure, systolic (sPAP) 15 -30 mmHg Pulmonary artery pressure, diastolic (dPAP) 4 -12 mmHg Pulmonary artery pressure, mean (mPAP) 8 -20 mmHg Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, mean (PAWP) 15 mmHg Cardiac output (CO) -8 120/80 mmHg Calculated parameters Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)b0.3-2.0 WU Pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) 3 -3.5 WU m2 Total pulmonary resistance (TPR)c<3 WU Cardiac index (CI) 2.5 -4.0 L/min/m2 Stroke volume (SV) 60 -100 mL Stroke volume (SVI) 33 -47 mL/m2 Pulmonary arterial compliance (PAC)d>2.3 mL/mmHg WU, Wood units.aDerived from blood sample taken from the pulmonary artery; compartmental oximetry to exclude of administration, half-life, dosages, and duration of administration of the recommended test compounds for vasoreactivity testing in pulmonary arterial hypertension Compound Route Half-life Dosage Duration Nitric oxide [129] inh 15 -30 s 10 -20 p.p.m. 5 -10 mina Iloprost [130, [129] i.v. 3 mind Inh, inhaled; i.v., intravenous.aMeasurement as a single step within the dose range.bAt mouth piece. cMeasurement as a single step, temporize full effect.dIncremental increase in 2 ng/kg/min intervals, duration of 10 min at each step. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 33EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.exercise RHC is not associated with an additional risk of complications compared with resting RHC and CPET [133]. Incremental exercise tests (step or ramp protocol) with repeated haemodynamic measurements provide the most clinical information on pulmonary circulation. The minimally required haemodynamic variablesmeasured at each exercise level include diastolic PAP (dPAP), PAWP, CO, heart rate, andsystemic blood pressure. In addition, RAP, SvO 2, and SaO 2should at least be measured at rest and peak exercise. Total pulmonary resistance (TPR), PVR, and cardiac index (CI) should be calculated at eachexercise level, as well as arteriovenous difference in oxygen at peak exercise. The mPAP/CO and PAWP/CO slopes should also be calculated [136, 137]. In patients with early PVD, PVR may be normal or mildlyelevated at rest, but may change during exercise with a steep increase in mPAP, reflected by an mPAP/COslope >3 mmHg/L/min, while the PAWP/CO slope usually remains <2 mmHg/L/min. Patients with leftheart dysfunction, such as those with [23] and/or dynamic mitral regurgitation [138], and a normalPAWP at rest, usually show a steep increase in mPAP and PAWP (and mPAP/CO, PAWP/CO slope)during exercise. According to recent studies, a PAWP/CO slope >2 mmHg/L/min may be helpful in recognizing an abnormal PAWP increase and, therefore, a cardiac exercise limitation, especially in patients with PAWP 12-15 mmHg at >25 mmHg exercise has been recommended for diagnosing HFpEF [16]. In patients with lung disease, increased intrathoracic pressuremay contribute to mPAP elevation; this is exaggerated during exercise and can be recognized by aconcomitant increase in RAP [140]. Some exercise haemodynamics are age dependent, with healthyelderly subjects presenting with steeper mPAP/CO and PAWP/CO slopes than healthy young individuals[9, 141]. 5.1.12.4. Fluid challenge Fluid challenge may reveal LV diastolic dysfunction in patients with PAWP 15 mmHg, but a clinical phenotype suggestive of LHD. Most available data are derived from studies aiming to uncover HFpEF(increase in PAWP) rather than identify group 2 PH (increase in PAP; see Section 8.1). It is generallyaccepted that rapid infusion (over 5 -10 min) of 500 mL (7 -10 mL/kg) of saline would be sufficient to detect an abnormal increase in PAWP to 18 mmHg (suggestive of HFpEF) [142], although validation and long-term evaluation of these data are needed [143]. There are insufficient data on the haemodynamicresponse to fluid challenge in patients with PAH. Recent data suggest that passive leg raise during RHCmay also help to uncover occult HFpEF [144].

HUMBERT ET AL.5.1.13. Genetic counselling and testing Mutations in PAH genes have been identified in familial PAH, IPAH, PVOD/PCH, andanorexigen-associated PAH (Table 13) [148]. The screening recommendations herein specifically relate topatients with an a priori diagnosis of PAH and not 'at-risk 'populations being screened for PAH (see Section 5.3). All patients with these conditions should be informed about the possibility of a geneticcondition and that family members could carry a mutation that increases the risk of PAH, allowing forscreening and early diagnosis [33, 148]. Even if genetic testing is not performed, family membersshould be made aware of early signs and symptoms, to ensure that a timely and appropriate diagnosis ismade [148]. Genetic counselling by appropriately trained PAH providers or geneticists should be performed prior to genetic testing, to address the complex questions related to penetrance, genetically at-risk familymembers, reproduction, genetic discrimination, and psychosocial issues . Careful genetic counselling with genetic counsellors or medical geneticists is critical prior to genetic testing for asymptomatic familymembers [148]. If the familial mutation is known and an unaffected family member tests negative for that mutation, the risk of PAH for that person is the same as for the general population [148]. Many of the less common mutations outlined have a potential additional set of syndromic features. These are summarized in Table 13 where specific clinical history, examination, and investigations are suggested.In particular, clinicians should undertake a thorough history and examination, as syndromic PAH diagnosesmay be missed if not interrogated. For example, in one of the largest studies to date, TBX4 ,ALK1 , and ENG mutations were represented in the top six most common genetic findings in adults with previously diagnosed IPAH [149]. These findings have been confirmed and extended in international geneticsconsortia in 4241 patients with PAH [150]. It is therefore apparent that there is either phenotypicheterogeneity of these syndromes or missed diagnostic features. As more genes associated with PAH arediscovered, it will become increasingly difficult to individually test for each. Next-generation sequencinghas enabled the development of gene panels to simultaneously interrogate several genes [151]. It is,however, important to check the genes included in the panel at the time of testing, since the compositionchanges as genetic discoveries advance. 5.2. Diagnostic algorithm A multistep, pragmatic approach to diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained dyspnoeaor symptoms/signs raising suspicion of PH. This strategy is depicted in detail in Figure 6 and Table 14.The diagnostic algorithm does not address screening for specific groups at risk of PH. 5.2.1 Step 1 (suspicion) Patients with PH are likely to be seen by first-line physicians, mainly general practitioners, for non-specificsymptoms. Initial evaluation should include a comprehensive medical (including familial) history, thoroughphysical examination (including measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry), blood test to determine BNP/NT-proBNP, and resting ECG. This first step may raise a suspicion of a cardiac or respiratory disorder causing the symptoms. 5.2.2. Step 2 (detection) The second step includes classical, non-invasive lung and cardiac testing. Among those tests,echocardiography is an important step in the diagnostic algorithm (Figure 6), as it assigns a level ofprobability of PH, irrespective of the cause. In addition, it is an important step in identifying other cardiacdisorders. Based on this initial assessment, if causes other than PH are identified and/or in case of lowprobability of PH, patients should be managed accordingly. 5.2.3. Step 3 (confirmation) Patients should be referred to a PH centre for further evaluation in the following situations: (1) when anintermediate/high probability of PH is established; (2) in the presence of risk factors for PAH, or a historyof PE. A comprehensive work-up should be performed, with the goal of establishing the differentialdiagnoses and distinguishing between the various causes of PH according to the current clinicalclassification. The PH centre is responsible for performing an invasive assessment according to the clinicalscenario. At any time, warning signs must be recognized, as they are associated with worse outcomes and warrant immediate intervention. Such warning signs include: rapidly evolving or severe symptoms (WHO-FC III/ https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 35EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M.

Such cases must beimmediately managed as inpatients for initial work-up at a nearby hospital or PH centre. The presence ofRV dysfunction by echocardiography, elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers, and/or haemodynamicinstability must prompt referral to a PH centre for immediate assessment. This diagnostic process emphasizes the importance of sufficient awareness and collaboration between first-line, specialized medicine and PH centres. Effective and rapid collaboration between each partnerpermits earlier diagnosis and management, and improves outcomes.

Screening and early detection Despite the advent of PAH therapies that prevent clinical worsening [166 -168] and effective interventions for CTEPH [102], the time from symptom onset to PH diagnosis remains at >2 years [169, 170], withmost patients presenting with advanced disease. Decreasing the time to diagnosis may reduce emotionaluncertainty in patients [171], reduce the use of health care resources, and enable treatment at an earlierstage when therapies may be more effective [172]. A proposed multifaceted approach [172] to facilitate an earlier diagnosis includes: (1) screening asymptomatic, high-risk groups (with high prevalence or where the diagnosis significantly impacts theproposed intervention), including individuals with SSc (prevalence: of patients with HPAH [148], and patients undergoing assessment for liver transplantation (2 -9%) [175]; (2) early detection of symptomatic patients in at-risk groups with conditions such as portal hypertension [176], HIV infection (0.5%) [177], and non-SSc CTD,where the lower prevalence rates do not support asymptomatic screening; and (3) applyingpopulation-based strategies by deploying early in PE follow-up clinics [178, 179], https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 ET AL.breathlessness clinics [172], or in at-risk patients identified from their health care behaviour and/or previous investigations [180]. Screening can be defined as the systematic application of a test or tests to identify at-risk, asymptomatic individuals. Screening approaches can also be extended to individuals who would not otherwise havesought medical attention on account of their symptoms, to facilitate early detection. Tools used to screenfor PH have primarily been assessed, but not exclusively, in SSc [172, 174], and include blood biomarkers(NT-proBNP), ECG, echocardiography (primarily using estimates of sPAP at rest, but also exercisestudies) [182], PFTs (DLCO and f orced vital capacity [FVC]/DLCO ratio), and exercise testing including CPET (which has been used in combination with screening algorithms to reduce the need for RHC)[123, 163]. 5.3.1. Systemic sclerosis In SSc, the prevalence of PAH is 5 -19% [174], with an annual incidence of developing PAH of 0.7 -1.5% [183 -185]. Evidence for the clinical value of detecting PAH early in SSc was provided by a screening programme [186], which showed less severe haemodynamic impairment and better survival in screenedpatients compared with a contemporaneous, non-screened cohort [187], providing a strong rationale forscreening for PAH in patients with SSc. The diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography or other tests alone in detecting PAH is suboptimal [173]. Several screening algorithms have been studied using a combination of clinical features, echocardiography,PFTs, and NT-proBNP to select patients with SSc for RHC (DETECT [173]; Australian SclerodermaInterest Group [ASIG] [188]). Such combined approaches have improved diagnostic accuracy comparedwith the use of echocardiography, NT-proBNP, or PFTs alone, and are able to prevent unnecessary RHCand identify patients with mPAP 21 -24 mmHg [189]. Therefore, a multimodal approach is warranted when screening patients with SSc for PAH; the echocardiographic assessment should follow the strategydescribed in Section 5.1.5. Beyond initial screening, the frequency with which screening should be undertaken in asymptomatic subjects with SSc is unclear. A study from the Australian Scleroderma Study Cohort, where annualscreening was recommended (some patients were screened up to 10 times), noted that most patients werediagnosed with PAH at their first screening; however, those diagnosed on subsequent screening had alower mPAP, PVR, and WHO-FC, and better survival than those diagnosed at first screening [190]. Basedon current evidence, annual screening for PAH in patients with SSc is sufficient. Given the financial andemotional cost associated with regular screening, stratifying subjects with SSc into those at highest andlowest risk of PAH would be desirable. Risk factors for PAH include: (1) clinical and demographic factors(i.e.breathlessness, longer disease duration, sicca symptoms, digital ulceration, older age, and male sex); and (2) the results of investigations ( e.g.positive anti-centromere antibody profile, mild ILD, low DLCO, elevated ratio, or elevated NT-proBNP) [174, 191]. A recent meta-analysis showed thatreduced digital capillary density, as assessed by video-capillaroscopy, or progression to a severe active/late pattern of vascular involvement is also a risk factor for PAH [192]. In addition to identifying patients at increased risk of PAH, a simple prediction model integrating symptoms, DLCO, and NT-proBNPidentified subjects at very low probability of PAH who could potentially avoid further specific testing forPH [183]. Furthermore, CPET may help to identify patients with SSc with a low risk of having PAH andthus to avoid unnecessary RHC [123]. The recommendations on screening for PAH in SSc have been established based on key narrative question 3 (Supplementary Data, Section 5.2). 5.3.2. BMPR2 mutation carriers In the evolving list of genes known to be associated with PAH, experience is largely restricted to BMPR2 mutation carriers who carry a lifetime risk of developing PAH of 20%, with penetrance higher in female carriers (42%) compared with male carriers (14%) [33, 148, 193]. There is currently no accepted screeningstrategy for evaluating PAH in BMPR2 mutation carriers. At present, based on expert consensus, asymptomatic relatives who screen positive for PAH-causing mutations are often offered yearly screeningechocardiography [25, 26] The DELPHI-2 study, which prospectively screened carriers and relatives,recently demonstrated a 9.1% pick up over 47\u00b127 months of PAH, with 2/55 diagnosed at baseline and 3/55 at follow-up; this equates to an incidence of 2.3%/year [33]. The screening schedule included ECG,NT-proBNP, DLCO, echocardiography, CPET, and optional RHC; however, none of the cases would havebeen picked up by echocardiography alone. Screening programmes should adopt a multimodal approach, https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 40EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.although the optimal strategy and screening period remains undefined and will require multinational, multicentre study. 5.3.3. Portal hypertension An estimated 1 -2% of patients with liver disease and portal hypertension develop PoPH [176, 194], which is of particular relevance in patients considered for transjugular portosystemic shunting or livertransplantation. In such patients, echocardiography is recommended to screen for PAH, even in the absenceof symptoms. By using echocardiography, sPAP can be measured in 80% of patients with portal hypertension, which aids decisions to perform RHC. In patients assessed for liver transplantation, onestudy showed that an sPAP of >50 mmHg had 97% sensitivity and 77% specificity for detectingmoderate-to-severe PAH [195]. Other investigators have recommended RHC when sPAP is >38 mmHg[196]. When screening for PoPH, it is advised to assess the echocardiographic probability of PH (seeSection 5.1.5). In agreement with the International Liver Transplant Society, for patients awaiting livertransplantation, it is recommended to reassess for PAH annually, although the optimal interval remainsunclear [175]. 5.3.4. Pulmonary embolism Chronic thrombo-embolic uncommon and under-diagnosed complication ofacute PE [112]. The reported cumulative incidence of CTEPH after acute, symptomatic PE ranges 0.1 - 11.8%, depending on the collective investigated [112, 178, 197 -199]. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported a CTEPH incidence of 0.6% in all patients with acute PE, 3.2% in survivors, and 2.8% in survivors without major comorbidities [178]. A multicentre, observational, screening study reported a CTEPH incidence of 3.7/1000 patient-years and a 2 year cumulative incidence of 0.79%following acute PE [200]. A recent prospective observational study (FOCUS, Follow-up After AcutePulmonary Embolism) showed a cumulative 2 year incidence of 2.3% and 16.0% for CTEPH and post-PEimpairment, respectively, which were both associated with a higher risk of rehospitalization and death[201]. Due to insufficient awareness, some patients may have a delayed diagnosis of CTEPH because theymay initially be misclassified as acute PE [112]. In this context, the current guidelines do not recommendroutine follow-up of patients with PE by imaging methods of the pulmonary vascular tree, but suggestevaluating the index imaging test used to diagnose acute PE for signs of CTEPH. Echocardiography is thepreferred first-line diagnostic test in patients with suspected CTEPH [103]. Up to 50% of patients have persistent perfusion defects after an acute PE; however, the clinical relevance is unclear [202 -204]. All patients in whom symptoms can be attributed to post-thrombotic deposits within PAs are considered to have CTEPD, with or without PH [54]. While persistent dyspnoea is common afteracute PE [205], the prevalence of CTEPD without PH is unknown and requires further study (see Section10.1). A study exploring screening for CTEPH following acute PE identified, using echocardiography, alow yield of CTEPH diagnoses in asymptomatic patients [206]. Current PE guidelinesrecommend that further diagnostic evaluation may be considered in asymptomatic patients with risk factorsfor CTEPH at 3 -6 months 'follow-up [103, 207]. Approaches to early detection of CTEPH following acute PE are based on identifying patients at increased risk [208]. In patients with persistent or new-onsetdyspnoea after PE, non-invasive approaches use echocardiography to assess for PH and cross-sectionalimaging to assess for persistent perfusion defects. Limited data exist on strategies using DECT, CT lungsubtraction iodine mapping, or 3D MR perfusion imaging. Scoring systems, including the Leiden CTEPHrule-out criteria [206, 209] can be used to inform diagnostic strategies. Cardiopulmonary exercise testingmay identify characteristic features of exercise limitation due to PVD, or suggest an alternative diagnosis.The optimal timing for assessing symptoms to aid early detection of CTEPH may be 3 -6 months after acute PE, coinciding with the routine evaluation of anticoagulant treatment, but earlier assessment may benecessary in highly symptomatic or deteriorating patients [54, 103].

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1) 6.1. Clinical characteristicsThe symptoms of PAH are non-specific and mainly related to progressive RV dysfunction (see Section5.1.1) as a consequence of progressive pulmonary vasculopathy (Figure 7). The presentation of PAH maybe modified by diseases that are associated with PAH, as well as comorbidities. More detailed descriptionsof the individual PAH subsets are reported in Section 7. 6.2. Severity and risk assessment 6.2.1. Clinical parametersClinical assessment is a key part of evaluating patients with PAH, as it provides valuable information fordetermining disease severity, improvement, deterioration, or stability. At follow-up, changes in WHO-FC(Table 15), episodes of chest pain, arrhythmias, haemoptysis, syncope, and signs of right HF provideimportant information. Physical examination should assess heart rate, rhythm, blood pressure, cyanosis,enlarged jugular veins, oedema, ascites, and pleural effusions. The WHO-FC is one of the strongestpredictors of survival, both at diagnosis and follow-up [210 -212], and worsening WHO-FC is one of the most alarming indicators of disease progression, which should trigger further investigations to identify thecause(s) of clinical deterioration [210, 213, 214]. 6.2.2. Imaging Imaging of the heart plays an essential role in the follow-up of patients with PAH. Severalechocardiographic and cMRI parameters have been proposed to monitor RV function during the course ofPAH. Table S2 provides a list of imaging parameters and relative cut-off values associated with increasedand decreased risk of adverse events. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 42EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.6.2.2.1. Echocardiography Echocardiography is a widely available imaging modality and is readily performed at the patient 's bedside. It is crucial that a high-quality echocardiographic assessment by PH specialists is undertaken to reduceintraobserver and interobserver variability. Of note, estimated sPAP at rest not prognostic and irrelevantto therapeutic decision-making [212, 215, 216]. An increase in sPAP does not necessarily reflect diseaseprogression and a decrease in sPAP does not necessarily reflect improvement. FIGURE 7 Pathophysiology and current therapeutic targets of pulmonary arterial hypertension | M. HUMBERT ET AL.Despite the complex geometry of the right heart, echocardiographic surrogates of the true right heart dimensions, which include a description of RV and RA areas, and the LV eccentricity index, provide useful clinical information in PAH [217, 218]. Right ventricular dysfunction can be TAPSE, tissue Doppler, and 2D speckle t racking myocardial strain recording of RV free-wall motion, all of which repr esent isovolumetric and ejection-phase indices of load-induced RV pump failure [219 -224]. The rationale for the reported measurements is strong, as RV systolic function metrics assess the adaptation of RV cont ractility to increased afterload, and increased right heart dimension and inferior vena cava dilation reflect failure of and tricus pid regurgitation (TR) grading further explore RV overload and are of prognostic relevance in these patients [218, 226 -228]. All of these variables are physiologically interdependent and their combination p rovides additional prognostic information over single measurements [223]. Echocardiography also enables combined parameters to be measured, such as the TAPSE/sPAP ratio, which is tightly linked to RV -PA coupling and predicts outcome [96, 97]. Echocardiographic measurements of RV and RA sizes combined with LV eccentricity index are crucial for assessing RV reverse remodelling as an emerging marker of treatment efficacy [220, 229]. Three-dimensionalechocardiography may achieve better estimation than standard 2D assessment, but underestimations ofvolumes and ejection fraction have been reported, and technical issues are, as yet, unresolved [230]. 6.2.2.2. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging The role of cMRI in evaluating patients with PAH has been addressed in several studies, and RV volumes,RVEF, and SV are essential prognostic determinants in PAH [225, 231 -236]. In patients with PAH, initial cMRI measurements added prognostic value to current risk scores [231, 232]. In addition, risk assessmentat 1 year of follow-up based on cMRI was at least equal to risk assessment based on RHC [237]. ThecMRI risk-assessment variables based on the current literature are included in Table 16 [117, 225, 231 - 235, 237]. The stroke volume index (SVI) cut-off levels are based on the consensus of the literature [238]; a change of 10 mL in SV (LV end-diastolic volume LV end-systolic volume) during follow-up is considered clinically significant [239]. The value of cMRI in the follow-up of patients has been shown inseveral studies, and cMRI enables treatment effects to be monitored and treatment strategies adapted intime to prevent clinical failure [240 -242]. 6.2.3. Haemodynamics Cardiopulmonary haemodynamics assessed by RHC provide important prognostic information, both at thetime of diagnosis and at follow-up [129, 212, 213, 216, 238, 243 -248]. Currently available risk-stratification tools include haemodynamic variables for prognostication: RAP and PVR in REVEALrisk scores [213, 249, [25, 26]. prognostic except in acute vasodilator responders [129].

HUMBERT ET AL.from France, which combined clinical and haemodynamic parameters, found that WHO-FC, 6MWD, RAP, and SVI (but not SV and SvO 2) were independent predictors of outcome [238]. To refine the risk-stratification table (Table 16), SVI criteria are now added with the cut-off values of >38 mL/m2and <31 mL/m2to determine low-risk The optimal timing of follow-up RHC has not been determined. While some centres regularly perform invasive follow-up assessments, others perform them as clinically indicated, and there is no evidence thatany of these strategies is associated with better outcomes (Table 17). 6.2.4. Exercise capacity The 6-minute walking test (6MWT) is the most widely used measure of exercise capacity in PH centres.The 6MWT is easy to perform, inexpensive, and widely accepted by patients, health professionals, andmedicines agencies as an important and validated variable in PH. As with all PH assessments, 6MWTresults must always be interpreted in the clinical context. The 6MWD is influenced by factors such as sex,age, height, weight, comorbidities, need for oxygen, learning curve, and motivation. Test results areusually given in absolute distance (metres) rather than the percentage of predicted values. Change in6MWD is one of the most commonly used parameters in PAH clinical trials as a primary endpoint, keysecondary endpoint, or component of clinical worsening [251]. A recent investigation showed that the bestabsolute-threshold values for 1 year mortality and 1 year survival, respectively, were 165 m and 440 m,TABLE 16 Comprehensive risk assessment in pulmonary arterial hypertension (three-strata model) Determinants of prognosis (estimated 1-year mortality)Low risk (<5%) Intermediate risk (5 -20%) High risk (>20%) Clinical observations and modifiable variables Signs of right HF Absent Absent Present Progression of symptoms and clinical manifestationsNo Slow Rapid Syncope No Occasional syncopeaRepeated syncopeb WHO-FC I, II III IV dioxide; Health Organization functional class aOccasional syncope during heavy exercise or occasional orthostatic syncope in a stable patient.bRepeated episodes of syncope even with little or regular physical activity.cObserve that 6MWD is dependent upon age, height, and burden of comorbidities.dTo harmonize with the four-strata model shown in Table 18, the BNP and NT-proBNP cut-off levels have been updated from the 2015 version based on data from the REVEAL registry, acknowledging that the European validation studies have used the original cut-off levels [274, 292, 293, 295, 296, 302].ecMRI Section https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.respectively [252]. Improvements in 6MWD have had less predictive value than deterioration on key clinical outcomes (mortality and survival) [250, 252, 253]. These results are consistent with observations from clinical trials and registries [254, 255]; however, there is no single threshold that would apply to all patients [256]. Some studies have also suggested that adding SaO 2measured by pulse oximetry and heart rate responses may improve prognostic relevance [246, 257]. Hypoxaemia observed during the 6MWT isassociated with worse survival, but these findings still await confirmation in large multicentre studies. The incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) is an alternative maximal test for assessing patients with PAH. The ISWT has a potential advantage over the 6MWT in that it does not have a ceiling effect;furthermore, it keeps the simplicity of a simple-to-perform field test, in contrast to CPET. However, theISWT experience in PAH is currently limited [258]. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a non-invasive method for assessing functional capacity and exercise limitation. It is usually performed as a maximal exercise test, and is safe even in patients with severeexercise limitation [259, 260]. Most PH centres use an incremental ramp protocol, although the test has notyet been standardized for this patient population. Robust prognostic evidence for peak VO 2and VE/VCO 2 has been found in three studies, all powered for multivariable analysis [261 -263]. When associated with SVI, peak VO 2provided useful information to further stratify patients with PAH at intermediate risk [264]. However, the added value of CPET on top of common clinical and haemodynamic variables remainslargely unexplored. 6.2.5. Biochemical markers Considerable efforts have been made to identify additional biomarkers of PVD, addressing prognosis [265 - 272], diagnosis, and differentiation of PH subtypes [270, 273 -276], as well as PAH treatment response [266]. Emerging proteins related to PAH and vascular remodelling include bone morphogenetic proteins 9and 10 and translationally protein [270, HPAH identified a multimarker panel with prognostic information in addition to the REVEAL riskscore [271]. Another study found that early development of SSc-associated PAH (PAH-SSc) was predictedTABLE 17 Suggested assessment and timing for the follow-up of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension At baseline 3 -6 months after changes in therapyaEvery 3 -6 months in stable patientsaIn case of clinical worsening Medical assessment (including WHO-FC) 6MWTBlood test (including NT-proBNP) b,c yellow: should be considered; orange: may be considered. aIntervals to be adjusted according to patient needs, PAH aetiology, risk category, demographics, and comorbidities.bBasic laboratory tests include blood count, INR (in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists), serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, ASAT/ALAT, e. g.TSH, troponin, uric acid, iron status, etc.) according to clinical circumstances.dABG should be performed at baseline but may be replaced by pulse oximetry in stable patients at follow-up. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 46EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.by high circulating levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 4 in patients with SSc [276]. However, none of these biomarkers have been introduced in clinical practice. Thus, BNP and NT-proBNP remain the only biomarkers routinely used in clinical practice at PH centres, correlating with myocardial stress and providing prognostic information [279]. Brain natriuretic peptide andNT-proBNP are not specific for PH, as they can be elevated in other forms of heart disease, exhibitinggreat variability. The previously proposed cut-off levels of and >1400 ng/L) for low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively, in the ESC/ERS risk-assessment model at baseline and during follow-up are prognostic for long-term outcomesand can be used to predict response to treatment [266]. Refined cut-off values for BNP for low, intermediate -low, intermediate -high, and high risk, respectively, have recently been introduced as part of a four-strata risk-assessment strategy (see Section 6.2.7) [280]. 6.2.6. Patient-reported outcome measures A patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) is a term for health outcomes that are 'self-reported 'by the patient. It is the patient 's experience of living with PH and its impact on them and their caregivers, including symptomatic, intellectual, psychosocial, spiritual, and goal-orientated dimensions of the diseaseand its treatment. Despite treatment advances improving survival, patients with PAH present with a rangeof non-specific yet debilitating symptoms, which affect health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) [281, 282]. Patient-reported outcome measures remain an underused outcome measure. Tools validated in patients with PAH should be used to assess HR-QoL [282, 283] in individual patients. There has been a reliance ongeneric PROMs, which have been studied in patients with PAH but may lack sensitivity to detect changesin PAH [284, 285]. To address this, a number of PH-specific HR-QoL instruments have been developedand validated ( Hypertension Outcome Review [CAMPHOR] [286], emPHasis-10 [282, 287], Living with Impact [PAH-SYMPACT]) [289]. These disease-specific PROMs trackfunctional status, clinical deterioration, and prognosis in PAH, and are more sensitive to the differences inthe risk status than generic PROMs [290, 291]. In scores provide independentprognostic information [287]. 6.2.7. Comprehensive prognostic evaluation, risk assessment, and treatment goals In the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH, risk assessment was based on amultiparametric approach using a three-strata model to classify patients at low, intermediate, or high risk ofdeath. Originally, these strata were based on estimated 1 year mortality rates of <5%, 5 -10%, and >10%, respectively [25, 26]. Since then, registry data have shown that observed 1 year mortality rates in theintermediate- and high-risk groups were sometimes higher than predicted ( i.e.up to 20% in the intermediate-risk group and >20% in the high-risk group). These numbers have been updated accordinglyin the revised three-strata risk model (Table 16) [292 -294]. Several abbreviated approaches of the 2015 ESC/ERS risk-stratification tool have been introduced and independently validated using the Swedish Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Registry (SPAHR) [292], theComparative, Prospective Registry of Newly Initiated Therapies for PH (COMPERA) [293], and theFrench PH Registry (FPHR) [295]. Other risk-stratification tools have been developed from the USREVEAL, including the REVEAL 2.0 risk score calculator, and an abridged version (REVEAL Lite 2)[249, 296]. In all these studies, WHO-FC, 6MWD, and BNP/NT-proBNP emerged as the variables withthe highest predictive value. The main limitation of the 2015 ESC/ERS three-strata, risk-assessment tool is that 60 -70% of the patients are classified as intermediate risk [274, 293 -295, 297 -303]. An initial attempt to substratify the intermediate-risk group has been proposed, using a modified mean score in the SPAHR equation (withlow-intermediate, 1.5 -1.99 and high -intermediate, 2.0 -2.49 as cut-offs), where the high -intermediate group was associated with worse survival [302]. There have also been attempts to further improve riskstratification by exploring the additional value of new biomarkers [304], or by measuring RV structure andfunction by echocardiography and cMRI [231, 305, 306]. Other strategies included or combining 6MWD with TAPSE/sPAP ratio [96, 97]; however, all of thesestrategies have to be further validated. Two recent registry studies have evaluated a four-strata, risk-assessment tool based on refined cut-off levels for WHO-FC, 6MWD, and NT-proBNP (Table 18) [280, 308]. Patients were categorized as low, https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 47EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M.

HUMBERT ET AL.intermediate -low, intermediate -high, or high risk. Together, these studies included >4000 patients with PAH and showed that the four-strata model performed at least as well as the three-strata model inpredicting mortality. The four-strata model predicted survival in patients with IPAH, HPAH, DPAH, andPAH associated with CTD (including the SSc subgroup), and in patients with PoPH. The observed 1-yearmortality rates in the four risk strata were 0 -3%, 2 -7%, 9 -19%, and >20%, respectively. Compared with the three-strata model, the four-strata model was more sensitive to changes in risk from baseline tofollow-up, and these changes were associated with changes in the long-term mortality risk. The mainadvantage of the four-strata model over the three-strata model is better discrimination within theintermediate-risk group, which helps guide therapeutic decision-making (see Section 6.3.4). For thesereasons, the four-strata model is included in the updated treatment algorithm (see Figure 9). However, thethree-strata model is maintained for initial assessment, which should be comprehensive and includeechocardiographic and haemodynamic variables, for which cut-off values for the four-strata model have yetto be established. Several studies have identified WHO-FC, 6MWD, and BNP/NT-proBNP as the strongest prognostic predictors [293, 295, 296]. With the abbreviated risk-assessment tools, missing values become animportant limitation. REVEAL Lite 2 provides accurate prediction when one key variable (WHO-FC, 6MWD, or BNP/NT-proBNP) is unavailable, but is no longer accurate when two of these variables are missing [293, 296]. The original three-strata SPAHR/COMPERA risk tool was developed with at least twovariables available, while the four-strata model was developed and validated in patients for whom all threevariables were available. It is therefore recommended to use at least these three variables for riskstratification. However, two components may be used when variables are missing, especially when afunctional criterion (WHO-FC or 6MWD) is combined with BNP or NT-proBNP [296]. Collectively, the available studies support a risk-based, goal-orientated treatment approach in patients with PAH, where achieving and/or maintaining a low-risk status is favourable and recommended (key narrativequestion 4, Supplementary Data, Section 6.1) [298, 300, 303, 309, 310]. For risk stratification at diagnosis,use of the three-strata model is recommended taking into account as many factors as possible (Table 16),with a strong emphasis on disease type, WHO-FC, 6MWD, BNP/NT-proBNP, and haemodynamics. Atfollow-up, the four-strata model (Table 18) is recommended as a basic risk-stratification tool, butadditional variables should be considered as needed, especially right heart imaging and haemodynamics.At any stage, individual factors such as age, sex, disease type, comorbidities, and kidney function shouldalso be considered. RECOMMENDATION TABLE 4 Recommendations for evaluating the disease severity and risk of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension Recommendations ClassaLevelb It is recommended to evaluate disease severity in patients with PAH with a panel of data derived from clinical assessment, exercise tests, biochemical markers, echocardiography, and haemodynamic evaluations [212, 213, 216, 249, 292, 293, 295, 296, 302, 307]IB Achieving and maintaining a low-risk profile on optimised medical therapy is recommended as a treatment goal in patients with PAH [210, 212, 213, 216, 298, 300, 303, 309, 310]IB For risk stratification at the time of diagnosis, the use of a three-strata model (low, intermediate, and high risk) is recommended, taking into account all available data,including haemodynamics [292, 293, 295]IB For risk stratification of a four-strata model (low, intermediate-low, intermediate-high, and high risk) based on WHO-FC, 6MWD, and BNP/NT-proBNP is recommended, with additional variables taken into account as necessary [280, 308]IB In some PAH aetiologies and in patients with comorbidities, optimisation of therapy should be considered on an individual basis while acknowledging that a low-risk profile is not alwaysachievable [293, 294, 299, Organization functional class. aClass of recommendation.bLevel of evidence. 6.3. Therapy According to the revised haemodynamic definition, PAH may be diagnosed in patients with mPAP>20 mmHg and PVR >2 WU.

HUMBERT ET AL.available for the efficacy of drugs approved for PAH in patients whose mPAP is <25 mmHg and whose PVR is <3 WU. Hence, for such patients, the efficacy of drugs approved for PAH has not beenestablished. The same is true for patients with exercise PH, who, by definition, do not fulfil the diagnosticcriteria for PAH. Patients at high risk of developing PAH, for instance patients with SSc or familymembers of patients with HPAH, should be referred to a PH centre for individual decision-making. 6.3.1. General measures Managing patients with PAH requires a comprehensive treatment strategy and multidisciplinary care. Inaddition to applying PAH drugs, general measures and care in special situations represent integralcomponents of optimized patient care. In this context, the systemic consequences of PH and right-sidedHF, often contributing to disease burden, should be appropriately managed [119]. 6.3.1.1. Physical activity and supervised rehabilitation The 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH suggested that patients with PAHshould be encouraged to be active within symptom limits [25, 26]. Since then, additional studies haveshown the beneficial impact of exercise training on exercise capacity (6MWD) and quality of life [312 -316]. A large, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 11 centres across 10 European countries, including 116patients with PAH/CTEPH on PAH drugs, showed a significant improvement in 6MWD of 34.1\u00b18.3 m,quality of life, WHO-FC, and peak VO 2compared with standard of care [315]. Since most of the studies included patients who were stable on medical treatment, patients with PAH should be treated with the beststandard of pharmacological treatment and be in a stable clinical condition before embarking on asupervised rehabilitation programme. Establishing specialized rehabilitation programmes for patients withPH would further enhance patient access to this intervention [317]. 6.3.1.2. Anticoagulation There are several reasons to consider anticoagulation in patients with PAH. Histopathological specimensfrom PAH patients 'lungs have shown in situ thrombosis of pulmonary vessels. Patients with CHD or PA aneurysms may develop thrombosis of the central PAs. Abnormalities in the coagulation and fibrinolyticsystem indicating a pro-coagulant state have been reported in patients with PAH [318]. Data from RCTs on anticoagulation in PAH are lacking, and registry data have yielded conflicting results. The largest registry analysis so far suggested a potential survival benefit associated with anticoagulation inpatients with IPAH [319], but this finding was not confirmed by others [320]. Two recent meta-analysesalso concluded that using anticoagulants may improve survival in patients with IPAH [321, 322]; however,none of the included studies were methodologically robust. Despite the lack of evidence, registry dataobtained between 2007 and 2016 showed that anticoagulation was used in 43% of patients with IPAH [293]. In PAH associated with SSc, registry data and meta-analyses uniformly indicated that anticoagulation may be harmful [320 -322]. In CHD, there are also no RCTs on anticoagulation. There is also no consensus about the use of anticoagulants in patients who have permanent i.v. lines for therapywith prostacyclin analogues; this is left to local centre practice. As anticoagulation is associated with an increased bleeding risk, and in the absence of robust data, no general recommendation has been made for or against the use of anticoagulants in patients with PAH;therefore, individual decision-making is required. 6.3.1.3. Diuretics Right HF is associated with systemic fluid retention, reduced renal blood flow, and activation of the renin - angiotensin -aldosterone system. Increased right-sided filling pressures are transmitted to the renal veins, increasing interstitial and tubular hydrostatic pressure within the encapsulated kidney, which decreases netglomerular filtration rate and oxygen delivery [119]. Avoiding fluid retention is one of the key objectives in managing patients with PH. Once these patients develop signs of right-sided HF and oedema, restricting fluid intake and using diuretics recommended.The three main classes of diuretics \u2014loop diuretics, thiazides, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists \u2014 are used as monotherapy or in combination, as determined by the patient 's clinical need and kidney function. Patients requiring diuretic therapy should be advised to regularly monitor their body weight andto seek medical advice in case of weight gain. Close collaboration between patients, PH centres, especiallyPH nurses, and primary care physicians plays a vital role. Kidney function and serum electrolytes shouldbe regularly monitored, and intravascular volume depletion must be avoided as it may cause a furtherdecline in CO and systemic blood pressure. Physicians should bear in mind that fluid retention and oedemamay not necessarily signal right-sided HF, but may also be a side effect of PAH therapy [323]. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 51EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.6.3.1.4. Oxygen Although oxygen administration reduces PVR and improves exercise tolerance in patients with PAH, thereare no data to suggest that long-term oxygen therapy has sustained benefits on the course of the disease.Most patients with PAH, except those with CHD and pulmonary-to-systemic shunts, have minor degrees ofarterial hypoxaemia at rest, unless they have a patent foramen ovale. Data show that nocturnal oxygentherapy does not modify the natural history of advanced Eisenmenger syndrome [324]. In the absence ofrobust data on the use of oxygen in patients with PAH, guidance is based on evidence in patients withCOPD [325]; when PaO 2is <8 kPa (60 mmHg; alternatively, SaO 2<92%) on at least two occasions, patients are advised to take oxygen to achieve a PaO 2>8 kPa. Ambulatory oxygen may be considered when there is evidence of symptomatic benefit and correctable desaturation on exercise [326, 327].Nocturnal oxygen therapy should be considered in case of sleep-related desaturation [328]. 6.3.1.5. Cardiovascular drugs No data from rigorous clinical trials are available on the usefulness and safety of drugs that are effective insystemic hypertension or left-sided beta-blockers, or ivabradine in patients with PAH. In this group ofpatients, these drugs may lead to potentially dangerous drops in blood pressure, heart rate, or both.Likewise, the efficacy of digoxin/digitoxin has not been documented in PAH, although these drugs may be administered to slow ventricular rate in patients with PAH who develop atrial tachyarrhythmias. 6.3.1.6. Anaemia and iron status Iron deficiency is common in patients with PAH and is defined by serum ferritin are complex [330 -333]. In patients with PAH, iron deficiency is associated with impaired myocardial function, aggravated symptoms, and increased mortality risk [333, 334]. Based on these data, regular monitoring ofiron status (serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptors) is recommended inpatients with PAH. In patients with severe iron deficiency anaemia (Hb <7 -8 g/dL), i.v. supplementation is recommended 337]. Oral iron formulations containing ferrous (Fe 2+) sulfate, ferrous gluconate, and ferrous fumarate are often poorly tolerated, and drug efficacy may be impaired in patients with PAH [330, 331]. Ferric maltol is a new,orally available formulation (Fe 3+) iron and maltol. One small, open-label study suggested good tolerability and efficacy in patients with severe PH with mild-to-moderate iron deficiency and anaemia [338].In contrast, two small, 12 week, randomized, cross-over trials studying iron supplementation in PAH patientswithout anaemia provided no significant clinical benefit [339]. Randomized controlled trials comparing oraland i.v. iron supplementation in patients with PAH are lacking. 6.3.1.7. Vaccination As a general health care measure, it is recommended that patients with PAH be vaccinated at least againstinfluenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and SARS-CoV-2. 6.3.1.8. Psychosocial support Receiving diagnosis of PH \u2014often after a substantial delay \u2014and experiencing the physical limitations have a substantial impact on psychological, emotional, and social aspects of patients and their families. Symptoms ofdepression and anxiety, as well as adjustment disorders, have a high prevalence in patients with PAH.Pulmonary arterial hypertension also has grave repercussions on ability to work and income [281, 340 -344]. Empathic and hopeful communication is essential for physicians caring for patients with PAH. Awareness and knowledge about the disease and its treatment options empower patients to engage in shareddecision-making. Adequate diagnostic screening tools are the key to identifying patients in need of referralfor psychological/psychiatric support, including psychopharmacological medication [345], or socialassistance. Patient support groups may play an important role, and patients should be advised to join suchgroups. Given the life-limiting character of PAH, advanced care planning with referral to specialistpalliative care services should be supported at the right time [346]. 6.3.1.9. Adherence to treatments Adhering to medical therapy is key to successfully managing PAH. In general, factors that affect adherenceare patient related ( e.g.demographics, cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, adverse reactions/side effects, psychological health, health literacy, patient understanding of the treatment rationale, and comorbidities), https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 52EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.physician related (expertise, awareness of guidelines, and multidisciplinary team approach), and health care system related (work setting, access to treatments, and cost) [347]. Recent studies have indicated that adherence to drug therapy in patients with PAH may be suboptimal [348, 349]. Given the complexity of PAH treatment, potential side effects, and risks associated withtreatment interruptions, adherence should be periodically monitored by a member of the multidisciplinaryteam, to identify non-adherence and any changes to the treatment regimen spontaneously triggered bypatients or non-expert physicians. To promote adherence, it is important to ensure that patients are involvedin care decisions and appropriately informed about treatment options and rationale, expectations, sideeffects, and potential consequences of non-adherence. Patients should be advised that any changes intreatment should be made in cooperation with the PH centre. 6.3.2. Special circumstances 6.3.2.1. Pregnancy and birth control6.3.2.1.1. Pregnancy . Historically, pregnancy in women with PAH and other forms of severe PH has been associated with maternal mortality rates of up to 56% and neonatal mortality rates of up to 13% [350].With improved treatment of PAH and new approaches to managing women during pregnancy and theperi-partum period, maternal mortality has declined but remains high, ranging 11 -25% [351 -355]. For these reasons, previous ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH have recommendedthat patients with PAH should avoid pregnancy [25, 26]. However, there are reports of favourablepregnancy outcomes in women with PH, including, but not limited to, women with IPAH who respond toCCB therapy [353, 354, 356, 357]. Nonetheless, pregnancy remains associated with unforeseeable risks,and may accelerate PH progression [358]. Women with PH can deteriorate at any time during or afterpregnancy. Therefore, physicians have a responsibility to inform patients about the risks of pregnancy, sothat women and their families can make informed decisions. Women with poorly controlled disease, indicated by an intermediate- or high-risk profile and signs of RV dysfunction, are at high risk of adverse outcomes; in the event of pregnancy, they should be carefullycounselled and early termination should be advised. For patients with well-controlled disease, a low-riskprofile, and normal or near-normal resting haemodynamics who consider becoming pregnant, individualcounselling and shared decision-making are recommended. In such cases, alternatives such as adoption andsurrogacy may also be explored. Pre-conception genetic counselling should also be considered in HPAH. Women with PH who become pregnant or present during pregnancy with newly diagnosed PAH should be treated, whenever possible, in centres with a multidisciplinary team experienced in managing PH inpregnancy. If pregnancy is continued, PAH therapy may have to be adjusted. It is recommended to stopendothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), riociguat, and selexipag because of potential evidence, CCBs, PDE5is, and are considered safe during pregnancy [356, 360]. Pregnancy in PH is a very sensitive topic and requires empathic communication. Psychological support should be offered whenever needed. 6.3.2.1.2. Contraception . Women with PH of childbearing potential should be provided with clear contraceptive advice, considering the individual needs of the woman but recognizing that the implicationsof contraceptive failure are significant in PH. With appropriate use, many forms of contraception, includingoral contraceptives, are highly effective. In patients treated with bosentan, reduced efficacy of hormonalcontraceptives should be carefully considered [361]. Using hormonal implants or an intrauterine device arealternative options with low failure rates. Surgical sterilization may be considered but is associated withperi-operative risks. Emergency post-coital hormonal contraception is safe in PH. 6.3.2.2. Surgical procedures Surgical procedures in patients with PH are associated with an elevated risk of right HF and death. In aprospective, multinational registry including 114 patients with PAH who underwent non-cardiac andnon-obstetric surgery, the peri-operative mortality rate was 2% in elective procedures and 15% inemergency procedures [362]. The mortality risk was associated with the severity of PH. The decision toperform surgery should be made by a multidisciplinary team involving a PH physician, and must be basedon an individual risk:benefit assessment considering various factors, including indication, urgency, PHseverity, and patient preferences. Risk scores to predict the peri-operative mortality risk have beendeveloped but require further validation [363]. General recommendations cannot be made. The same is trueregarding the preferred mode of anaesthesia. Pre-operative optimization of PAH therapy should be https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 53EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.attempted whenever possible (see also the 2022 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular assessment and management of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery) [364]. 6.3.2.3. Travel and altitude RV load in PAH [365, 366]. Cabin aircraft pressures are equivalent to altitudes up to 2438 m[367], at which the PaO 2decreases to that of an inspired O 2fraction of 15.1% at sea level [365]. However, evidence suggests that short-term (less than 1 day) normobaric hypoxia is generally well tolerated inclinically stable patients with PAH [365, 368 -372]. In-flight oxygen administration is advised for patients using oxygen at sea level and for those with PaO 2<8 kPa (60 mmHg) or SaO 2<92% [25, 26, 325, 369, 372]. An oxygen flow rate of 2 L/min will raise inspired oxygen pressure to values as at sea level, and patientsalready using oxygen at sea level should increase their oxygen flow rate [25, 26, 373]. As the effects of moderate to long-term (hours -days) hypoxia exposure in PAH remain largely unexplored [374, 375], patients should avoid altitudes >1500 m without supplemental oxygen [25, 26, 369]. However,patients with PAH who are not hypoxaemic at sea level have tolerated day trips to 2500 m reasonablywell [376]. Patients should travel with written info rmation about their disease, including a medication list, bring extra doses of their medication, and be informed about local PH centres near their traveldestination [25, 26].

Pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies 6.3.3.1. Calcium channel blockersPatients with PAH who respond favourably to acute vasoreactivity testing (Figure 8) may respondfavourably to treatment with CCBs [129, 146]. Less than 10% of patients with IPAH, HPAH, or DPAHare responders, while an acute vasodilator response does not predict a favourable long-term response toCCBs in patients with other forms of PAH [129, 146, 378]. The CCBs that have predominantly amlodipine [129, 146]. Amlodipine and felodipine are increasingly being used in clinical practice due to their long half-life and good tolerability. The daily doses that have shown efficacy in PAH are relatively high and they must be reached progressively (Table 19). The mostcommon adverse events are systemic hypotension and peripheral oedema. Patients who meet the criteria for a positive acute vasodilator response and treated with CCBs should be closely followed for safety and efficacy, with a complete reassessment after 3 -6 months of therapy, including RHC. Additional acute vasoreactivity testing should be performed at re-evaluation to detectpersistent vasodilator response, supporting possible increases in CCB dosage. Patients with a satisfactorychronic response present with WHO-FC I/II and marked haemodynamic improvement mPAP<30 mmHg and PVR <4 WU) while on CCB therapy. In the absence of a satisfactory response, additionalPAH therapy should be instituted. In some cases, a combination of CCBs with approved PAH drugs isrequired because of clinical deterioration with CCB withdrawal attempts. Patients who have not undergonea vasoreactivity study or those with a negative test should not be started on CCBs because of potentiallysevere side effects ( e.g.severe hypotension, syncope, and RV failure), unless prescribed at standard doses for other indications [379].

HUMBERT ET AL.nitric oxide, and clearance of endothelin-1 [380]. Nevertheless, selective blocking of endothelin A receptors alone or non-selective blocking of both A and B receptors has shown similar effectiveness inPAH [380]. Endothelial receptor antagonists have teratogenic effects used duringpregnancy [381]. 6.3.3.2.1. Ambrisentan . Ambrisentan is an oral ERA that preferentially blocks the endothelin A receptors. The approved dosages in adults are 5 mg and 10 mg o.d. In patients with PAH, it has demonstratedefficacy for symptoms, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening [382]. Anincreased incidence of peripheral oedema was reported with ambrisentan use, while there was no increasedincidence of abnormal liver function. 6.3.3.2.2. Bosentan . Bosentan is an oral, dual ERA that improves exercise capacity, WHO-FC, haemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening in patients with PAH [383]. The approved target dose in adults is 125 mg b.i.d. Dose-dependent increases in liver transaminases can occur in 10% of treated patients (reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation) [384]. Thus, liver function testing should beperformed monthly in patients receiving bosentan [384]. Due to pharmacokinetic interactions, bosentanmay render hormonal contraceptives unreliable and lower serum . Macitentan is an oral, dual ERA that has been found to increase exercise capacity and reduce a composite endpoint of clinical worsening in patients with PAH [167]. While no liver toxicityhas been shown, a reduction in Hb to 8 g/dL was observed in 4.3% of patients receiving 10 mg of macitentan [167]. 6.3.3.3. Phosphodiesterase 5 guanylate cyclase (sGC) by nitric intracellularsecond messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Figure 7). This pathway is controlled by anegative feedback loop through degradation of cGMP via different phosphodiesterases, among whichsubtype 5 (PDE5) is abundantly in the pulmonary vasculature [388]. Phosphodiesterase 5inhibitors and sGC stimulators must not be combined with each other and with nitrates, as this can resultin systemic hypotension [389]. 6.3.3.3.1. Sildenafil Sildenafil and selective inhibitor of PDE5. Several RCTs of patients with PAH treated with sildenafil (with or without background therapy) have confirmed favourableresults on exercise capacity, symptoms, and/or haemodynamics [390 -392]. The approved dose of sildenafil is 20 mg t.i.d. Most side effects of sildenafil are mild to moderate and mainly related to vasodilation(headache, flushing, and epistaxis). 6.3.3.3.2. of 406 patients with PAH (53% on background bosentan therapy) treated with tadalafil at doses up to 40 mg o.d. showed favourable resultson exercise capacity, symptoms, haemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening [393]. The side effectprofile was similar to that of sildenafil. Riociguat . While PDE5is augment by slowing cGMP degradation, sGC stimulators enhance cGMP production by directly stimulating the enzyme, both in thepresence and absence of endogenous nitric oxide [394]. An RCT of 443 patients with PAH (44% and 6%on background therapy with ERAs or prostacyclin analogues, treated with riociguat up to2.5 t.i.d. showed favourable results on exercise capacity, haemodynamics, WHO-FC, and time toclinical worsening [395]. The side effect profile was similar to that of PDE5is. 6.3.3.4. Prostacyclin analogues and prostacyclin pathway (Figure 7) is dysregulated in patients with PAH, with less prostacyclinsynthase expressed in and also have bothcytoprotective and anti-proliferative activities [397]. The most common adverse events observed with thesecompounds are related to systemic vasodilation and include headache, flushing, jaw pain, and diarrhoea. 6.3.3.4.1. Epoprostenol . Epoprostenol has a short half-life (3 -5 min) and needs continuous i.v. administration via an infusion pump and a permanent tunnelled catheter. A thermo-stable formulation isavailable to maintain stability up to 48 h [398]. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in three unblindedRCTs in patients with IPAH (WHO-FC III GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.Epoprostenol improved symptoms, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and mortality [399]. Long-term, persistent efficacy has also been shown in IPAH [212, 245], as well as in other associated PAH conditions[402 -404]. Serious adverse events related to the delivery system include pump malfunction, local site infection, catheter obstruction, and sepsis. Recommendations for preventing central venous catheterbloodstream infections have been Iloprost is a prostacyclin analogue approved for inhaled administration. Inhaled iloprost has been evaluated in one RCT, in which six to nine repetitive iloprost inhalations were compared withplacebo in treatment-na\u00efve patients with PAH or CTEPH [407]. The study showed an increase in exercisecapacity and improvement in symptoms, PVR, and clinical events in the iloprost group compared with theplacebo group. 6.3.3.4.3. Treprostinil . Treprostinil is available for s.c., i.v., inhaled, and oral administration. Treprostinil s.c. improved exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and symptoms in PAH [408]. Infusion-site pain was the mostcommon adverse effect, which led to treatment discontinuation in 8% of cases [408]. Based on its chemicalstability, i.v. treprostinil may also be administered via implantable pumps, improving convenience andlikely decreasing the occurrence of line infections [409, 410]. Inhaled treprostinil improved the 6MWD, NT-proBNP, and quality of life measures in patients with PAH on background therapy with either bosentan or sildenafil [411]. Inhaled treprostinil is not approved inEurope. Oral treprostinil has been evaluated in two RCTs of patients with PAH on background therapy with bosentan and/or sildenafil. In both trials, the primary endpoint \u20146MWD \u2014did not reach statistical significance [412, 413]. An RCT in treatment-na\u00efve patients with PAH showed improved6MWD [414]. An event-driven RCT that enrolled 690 patients with PAH demonstrated that oraltreprostinil reduced the risk of clinical worsening events in patients who were receiving oral monotherapywith ERAs or PDE5is [415]. Oral Europe. 6.3.3.4.4. Beraprost . Beraprost is a chemically stable and orally active prostacyclin analogue. Two RCTs have shown a modest, short-term improvement in exercise capacity in patients with PAH [416, 417];however, there were no haemodynamic improvements or long-term outcome Beraprost is notapproved in Europe. 6.3.3.4.5. Selexipag . Selexipag is an orally available, selective, prostacyclin receptor agonist that is chemically distinct from prostacyclin, with different pharmacology. In a pilot RCT in patients with PAH(receiving stable ERA and/or PDE5i therapy), selexipag reduced PVR after 17 weeks [418]. Anevent-driven, phase 3 RCT that enrolled 1156 patients [419] showed that selexipag alone or on top ofmono or double therapy with an ERA and/or a PDE5i reduced the relative risk of composite morbidity/mortality events by 40%. The most common side effects were headache, diarrhoea, nausea, and jaw pain. 6.3.4. Treatment strategies for patients with idiopathic, tissue disease-associated hypertension is a rare and life-threatening disease and should be managed, wherepossible, at PH centres in close collaboration with the patient 's local physicians. This section describes drug treatment and is focused on non-vasoreactive patients with IPAH/HPAH/ DPAH and on patients with PAH associated with connective tissue disease (PAH-CTD). Information onthe dosing of PAH medication is summarized in Table 19. For other forms of PAH, treatment strategieshave to be modified (see Section 7). The approach to vasoreactive patients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH isdescribed in Section 6.3.3.1. In addition to targeted drug treatment, the comprehensive management of patients with PAH includes general measures that may include supplementary oxygen, diuretics to optimize volume status,psychosocial support, and standardized exercise training (Section 6.3.1) [315]. Prior to the treatmentdecisions, patients and their next of kin should be provided with appropriate and timely information aboutthe risks and benefits of the treatment options so they can make the final, informed, and joint decisionabout the treatment with the medical team. Treatment decisions in patients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH orPAH-CTD should be stratified according to the presence or absence of cardiopulmonary comorbidities(Section 6.3.4.3) and according to disease severity assessed by risk stratification (Section 6.2.7). https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 58EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.6.3.4.1. Initial treatment decision in patients without cardiopulmonary comorbidities The initial treatment of patients with PAH should be based on a comprehensive, multiparameter riskassessment, considering disease type and severity, comorbidities, access to therapies, economic aspects,and patient preference. The following considerations predominantly apply to patients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD without cardiopulmonary comorbidities, as patients with comorbidities were under-represented in the clinical studiesaddressing treatment strategies and combination therapy in patients with PAH. Treatment considerations forpatients with PAH and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are summarized in Section 6.3.4.3. For patients presenting at low or intermediate risk, initial combination therapy with an ERA and a PDE5i is recommended. This approach was assessed in the AMBITION study, which compared initialcombination therapy using ambrisentan at a target dose of 10 mg o.d. and tadalafil at a target dose of40 mg o.d. with initial monotherapy with either drug [166]. AMBITION predominantly included patientswith IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD. The primary endpoint was the time to first clinical failure event (acomposite of death, hospitalization for worsening PAH, disease progression, or unsatisfactory long-termclinical response). The hazard ratio (HR) for the primary endpoint in the combination-therapy group versus the pooled monotherapy group was 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 -0.72; P<0.001) and there were significant improvements in 6MWD and NT-proBNP with initial combination therapy. At the end ofthe study, 10% of the patients assigned to initial combination therapy had died compared with 14% of thepatients assigned to initial monotherapy (HR 0.67; 0.42 -1.08) [420]. In the TRITON study, treatment-na\u00efve patients with PAH were assigned to initial dual-combination therapy with macitentan and tadalafil, or initial triple-combination therapy with macitentan 10 mg o.d., tadalafil ata target dose of 40 mg o.d., and selexipag up to 1600 \u00b5g o.d [421]. TRITON includedpatients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD. 26, PVR was reduced by 52% and 54%, withdouble- or triple-combination therapy, respectively, and 6MWD had increased by 55 m and 56 m,respectively. The geometric means of the NT-proBNP ratio from baseline to week 26 were 0.25 and 0.26,respectively. Hence, TRITON did not show a benefit of oral triple- versus oral double-combination therapy but confirmed that substantial improvements in haemodynamics and exercise capacity can be obtained withinitial ERA/PDE5i combination therapy. Further studies are needed to determine whether oraltriple-combination therapy impacts long-term outcomes. Based on the evidence generated by these and other studies [303, 422 -424], initial dual-combination therapy with an ERA and a PDE5i is recommended for newly diagnosed patients who present at low orintermediate risk. Initial oral triple-combination therapy is not recommended, given the current lack ofevidence supporting this strategy. In patients presenting at high risk, initial triple-combination therapyincluding an i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogue should be considered [426, 427]. While it is acknowledged thatthe evidence for this approach is limited to case series, there is consensus that this strategy has the highestlikelihood of success, especially in view of registry data from France showing that initialtriple-combination therapy including an i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogue was associated with better long-termsurvival than therapy [428]. Initial triple-combination therapy includingan i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogue should also be considered in patients at intermediate risk presenting withsevere haemodynamic 426]. The recommendations for initial oral double-combination therapy are based on PICO question I (Supplementary Data, Section 6.2). Although the quality of evidence is low, initial oral combinationtherapy with an ERA and a PDE5i achieves important targets in symptom improvement (functional class),exercise capacity, cardiac biomarkers, and reduction of hospitalizations.

Treatment decisions during follow-up in patients without cardiopulmonary comorbidities Patients with PAH require regular follow-up, including risk stratification and an assessment of patientconcordance with therapy. Patients who achieve a low-risk status have a much superior long-term survivalcompared with patients with intermediate- or high-risk status [292, 295, 296]. Achieving and maintaining alow-risk profile is therefore a key objective in managing patients with PAH. Several clinical trials have assessed the safety and efficacy of sequential combination therapy in patients with PAH. SERAPHIN enrolled 742 patients with PAH, mostly with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH and PAH-CTD,of whom 63.7% were receiving other PAH medication at the time of enrolment, mostly sildenafil [167]. In https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 60EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.the subgroup of patients with background PAH therapy, macitentan at a daily dose of 10 mg reduced the risk of clinical worsening events compared with placebo (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43 -0.89) [167]. GRIPHON assessed the safety and efficacy of selexipag [419]. This study enrolled 1156 patients with PAH, also mostly with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD, who were treatment na\u00efve or receivingbackground therapy with an ERA, PDE5i, or a combination of both. Selexipag at a dose of up to 1600 \u00b5gb.i.d. was associated with a reduced risk of clinical worsening events independent of the backgroundmedication. In patients receiving ERA/PDE5i combination therapy ( n=376), the risk of clinical worsening events was lower with selexipag than with placebo (HR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44 -0.90) [431]. The effects of combination therapy on long-term survival in patients with PAH remain unclear. A 2016 meta-analysis demonstrated that combination therapy (initial and sequential) was associated with asignificant risk reduction for clinical worsening risk CI, 0.58 -0.72; 95% CI, 0.72 -1.03; P=0.09) and a substantial proportion of patients had clinical worsening events or died despite receiving combinationtherapy. In addition, registry data showed that the use of combination therapy increased since 2015 butthere was no clear improvement in overall survival rates [428, 433, 434]. These data were corroborated by a study showing that less than half of patients receiving initial combination therapy with an ERA and a PDE5i achieved and maintained a low-risk profile [422]. Switching from PDE5is to riociguat has also been investigated as a treatment-escalation strategy [429, 435]. REPLACE was a randomized, controlled, open-label study that enrolled patients on a PDE5i-basedtherapy who were in WHO-FC III and had a 6MWD of 165 -440 m [429]. The study predominantly included patients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD who were randomized to continue their PDE5i orto switch from a PDE5i to riociguat up to 2.5 mg t.i.d. The study met its primary endpoint, termed'clinical improvement ', which was a composite of pre-specified improvements in 6MWD, WHO-FC, and NT-proBNP at week 24. Clinical improvement at week 24 was demonstrated in 41% of the patients whoswitched to riociguat and in 20% of the patients who (odds ratio [OR] 2.78; 95%CI, 1.53 -5.06; P=0.0007). In addition, fewer patients in the riociguat group experienced a clinical worsening event (OR 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01 -0.73; P=0.0047). Based on the evidence summarized above, the following recommendations for treatment decisions during follow-up are:i) In patients who achieve a low-risk status with their initial PAH therapy, continuation of treatment is recommended. ii) In patients who are at intermediate -low risk despite receiving ERA/PDE5i therapy, adding selexipag should be considered to reduce the risk of clinical worsening. In these patients, switching from PDE5ito riociguat may also be considered. iii) In patients who are at intermediate -high or high risk while receiving oral therapies, the addition of i.v. epoprostenol or i.v./s.c. treprostinil and referral from PDE5i toriociguat may be considered.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension with cardiopulmonary comorbidities Over the past decade, the demographics and characteristics of patients with IPAH have changed, especiallyin industrialized countries [447]. In several contemporary registries, the average age of patients diagnosedwith IPAH is 60 years or older [161, 295, 299, 447, 448]. Many elderly patients have cardiopulmonary comorbidities, making the distinction from group 2 and group 3 PH challenging. Among elderly patientsdiagnosed with IPAH, two main disease phenotypes have emerged. One phenotype (herein called the leftheart phenotype) consists of elderly, mostly female patients with risk factors for HFpEF ( e.g.hypertension, obesity, diabetes, or coronary heart disease) but pre-capillary PH rather than post-capillary PH [449, 450]; 30% of these patients have a history of atrial fibrillation [161]. The other phenotype (called the cardiopulmonary phenotype) consists of elderly, predominantly male patients who have a low DLCO(<45% of the predicted value), are often hypoxaemic, have a significant smoking history, and have riskfactors for LHD [77, 78, 161, 451]. In a cluster analysis of 841 newly diagnosed patients with IPAH fromthe COMPERA registry, 12.6% had a classic phenotype of young, mostly female patients withoutcardiopulmonary comorbidities, while 35.8% presented with a left heart phenotype 51.6% with acardiopulmonary phenotype [161]. There are no evidence-based rules for determining a patient 's phenotype. The AMBITION study used the presence of more than three risk factors for LHD together with certain haemodynamic criteria to excludepatients from the primary analysis [166]. However, the COMPERA cluster analysis mentioned above foundthat the presence of a single risk factor may change the phenotype [161]. Pending further data, it is theoverall profile that should be used to determine a patient 's phenotype. Compared with patients without cardiopulmonary comorbidities, patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities respond less well to PAH medication, are more likely to discontinue this medication due toefficacy failure or lack of tolerability, are less likely to reach a low-risk status, and have a higher mortalityrisk. While the age-adjusted mortality of patients with the left heart phenotype seems to be similar to thatof patients with classical PAH, patients with a cardiopulmonary phenotype and a low DLCO have aparticularly high mortality risk [77, 78, 161, 450, 451]. As patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities were under-represented in or excluded from PAH trials, no evidence-based treatment recommendations can be made for this patient population. Registry datasuggest that most physicians use PDE5is as primary treatment for these patients. Endothelin receptorantagonists or PDE5i/ERA combinations are occasionally used, but the drug discontinuation rate is higherthan in patients with classical PAH [447, 450]. A subgroup analysis from AMBITION, which assessed theresponse to PAH therapy in 105 patients who were excluded from the primary analysis set because of a leftheart phenotype, found that these patients \u2014compared with patients in the primary analysis set \u2014had less clinical improvement and a higher likelihood of drug discontinuations due to safety and tolerability with https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 62EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.both monotherapy and initial combination therapy [449]. Data from the ASPIRE registry demonstrated that patients with IPAH and a cardiopulmonary phenotype had less improvement in exercise capacity andPROMs compared with patients with classical IPAH [451]. In patients with a left heart phenotype, ERA therapy is associated with an elevated risk of fluid retention [449]. Moreover, in patients with a cardiopulmonary phenotype, PAH medication may cause a decline inthe peripheral oxygen saturation [452]. There is little published experience on the use of prostacyclinanalogues or prostacyclin receptor agonists in this patient population [453]. The lack of solid evidence for treating elderly patients with PAH and cardiopulmonary comorbidities makes treatment recommendations challenging, and patients should be counselled accordingly. In theabsence of evidence on treatment strategies in these patients, risk stratification is of limited usefulness inguiding therapeutic decision-making. Initial monotherapy (see Supplementary Data, Table S3) isrecommended for most of these patients, with PDE5is being the most widely used compounds accordingto registry data [161]. Further treatment decisions should be made on an individual basis in collaborationwith the PH centre and local physicians. The treatment algorithm for patients with PAH is shown in Figure 9 and the accompanying section describing the treatment algorithm.

Drug interactions Among PAH drugs, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are observed between bosentan andsildenafil (reduced sildenafil plasma concentration [385]), bosentan and hormonal contraceptives (reducedcontraception efficacy [361]), and bosentan and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (potential need for VKAdose adjustment [386]). Additional pharmacokinetic interactions of potential clinical relevance are listed inSupplementary Data, Table S4. 6.3.6. Interventional shunt [456 -459], by connecting the left PA and descending aorta, aim to decompress the right heart and increase systemic blood flow, thereby improving systemic oxygen transport despite arterial oxygen desaturation. As these proceduresare complex and associated with high risk, including substantial procedure-related mortality, they are rarelyperformed in patients with PAH and may only be considered in centres with experience in the techniques. 6.3.6.2. Pulmonary artery denervation The rationale for performing a PA denervation (PADN) is based on the increased sympathetic overdrivecharacterizing PAH, which is associated with poor outcome [460, 461]. Although the contribution of thismechanism to developing PAH is not completely understood, it is associated with vasoconstriction andvascular remodelling through a baroreflex mediated by stretch receptors at the bifurcation of thePas [462, 463]. Applying radiofrequency at the latter acutely and chronically improves haemodynamicvariables [464]. However, there is little evidence yet from multicentre RCTs demonstrating a benefit of https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 63EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.PADN in patients already receiving recommended medical therapy. A small multicentre study tested the feasibility of PADN using an intravascular ultrasound catheter in patients receiving dual or triple therapyfor PAH [465]; the procedure was safe and associated with a reduction in PVR, and increases in 6MWDand daily activity. Although potentially promising, PADN should be considered experimental. 6.3.7. Advanced right ventricular failure 6.3.7.1. Intensive care unit managementPatients with PH may require intensive care treatment fo r right HF, comorbidities (including major surgery), or both. The mortality risk is high in such patients [466, 467], and specialized centres should be involved wheneverpossible. In addition to basic intensive care unit (IC U) standards, RV function in these patients should be carefully monitored. Non-specific clinical signs of right HF with low CO include pale skin with peripheralcyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia, declining urine output, and increasing lactate levels. Non-invasive monitoring should include biomarkers (NT-proBNP and troponi n) and echocardiography. Minimum invasive monitoring consists of an upper body central venous catheter to measure central venous pressure and central venous oxygensaturation, the latter reflecting CO. Right heart catheterization or other forms of advanced haemodynamicassessment should be considered in patients with advanced right HF or in complex situations [468]. Treating right HF should focus on treatable triggers such as infection, arrhythmia, anaemia, and other comorbidities. Fluid management is of utmost importance in these patients, most of whom require a negativefluid balance to reduce RV pre-load, thereby improving RV geometry and function [468]. Patients with a lowCO may benefit from treatment with inotropes; dobutamine and milrinone are the most frequently usedsubstances in this setting. Maintaining the mean systemic blood pressure >60 mmHg is a key objective whentreating right HF, and patients with persistent hypotension may require vasopressors such as norepinephrine orvasopressin. Intubation and invasive mechanical ventilat ion should be avoided whenever possible in patients with advanced RV failure because of a high risk of further haemodynamic deterioration and death. Pulmonaryarterial hypertension medication should be considered on an individual basis, taking into account underlying disease, comorbidities, and existing medication. In patients with newly diagnosed PAH presenting with lowCO, combination therapy including i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogues should be considered [426]. 6.3.7.2. Mechanical circulatory support In specialist centres, various forms of mechanical circulatory support are available for managing RVfailure, with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) being the most widely usedapproach. Mechanical circulatory support has become an established bridging tool to transplantation inpatients with irreversible right HF, but is occasionally used as a bridge to recovery in patients withtreatable causes and potentially reversible RV failure [468]. No general recommendations can be maderegarding the indication for mechanical circulatory support, which needs to be individualized, consideringpatient factors and local resources [469, 470]. Long-term mechanical support analogous to left ventricularassist devices (LVADs) is not yet available for patients with PH and end-stage right HF. RECOMMENDATION TABLE 12 Recommendations for intensive care management for pulmonary arterial hypertension Recommendations ClassaLevelb When managing patients with right HF in the ICU, it is recommended to involve physicians with expertise, treat causative factors, and use supportive measures, including inotropes and vasopressors, fluid management, and PAH drugs, as appropriateIC Mechanical circulatory support may be an option for selected patients as bridge to transplantation or to recovery, and interhospital transfer should be considered if such resources are not available on siteIIa C HF, heart failure; ICU, intensive care unit; PAH, pulmonary arterial hypertension.aClass of recommendation. bLevel of evidence. 6.3.8. Lung and heart -lung transplantation Lung transplantation remains an important treatment option for patients with PAH refractory to optimizedmedical therapy. In patients with PAH, referral to an LTx centre should be considered early (Table 20):1) when they present with an inadequate response to treatment despite optimized combination therapy;2) when they present with an intermediate -high or high risk of death ( i.e.1-year mortality >10% when estimated with established risk-stratification tools) [471] (see Section 6.2.7), which exceeds the currentmortality rate after LTx [472]; 3) when patients have a disease variant that poorly responds to medicaltherapy, such as PVOD or PCH. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 64EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY GUIDELINES HUMBERT ET AL.Both heart -lung and bilateral LTx have been performed for PAH. Currently, most patients receive bilateral LTx, while combined heart -lung transplantation is reserved for patients who have additional non-correctable cardiac conditions [473]. With the introduction of the lung allocation score (LAS), waiting list mortality has decreased and the odds of receiving a donor organ have increased [474]. In somecountries, an 'exceptional LAS 'can be obtained for patients with severe PH. Some other countries not using the LAS have successfully implemented high-priority programmes for these patients [475]. Thepatient and their next of kin should be fully engaged in the transplant assessment process and informed ofthe risks and benefits, and the final decision should be jointly made between the patient and medical team(see Section 6.3.1.8). For patients with PAH who survive the early post-transplant period, long-termoutcomes are good. A study found that for primary transplant patients with IPAH who survived to 1 year,conditional median survival was 10.0 years [476].

Theevidence supporting this algorithm has mainly been generated in patients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD who present without cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Patients with HIV-associated PAH, PoPH, and PAH associated with congenital heart disease were not enrolled or under-represented in most PAHtherapy trials. Treatment recommendations for these patients are provided in Section 7. 6.3.10. Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension complications 6.3.10.1. ArrhythmiasThe most common types of arrhythmias observed in PAH are supraventricular, mainly atrial fibrillationand atrial flutter, while the frequency appears to beconsiderably lower [477 -479]. Of note, age is an independent risk factor for atrial arrhythmias.TABLE 20 Criteria for lung transplantation and listing in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension Referral Potentially eligible patients for whom LTx might be an option in case of treatment failure ESC/ERS intermediate -high or high risk or REVEAL risk score >7 on appropriate PAH medication Progressive disease or recent hospitalization for worsening PAHNeed for i.v. or s.c. prostacyclin therapyKnown or suspected high-risk variants, such as PVOD or PCH, systemic sclerosis, or large and progressive pulmonary artery aneurysms Signs of secondary liver or kidney dysfunction due to PAH or other potentially life-threatening complications, such as recurrent haemoptysis Listing Patient has been fully evaluated and prepared for transplantationESC/ERS high risk or REVEAL risk score >10 on appropriate PAH medication, usually including i.v. or s.c. prostacyclin analogues Progressive hypoxaemia, especially in patients with PVOD or PCHProgressive, but not end-stage liver or kidney dysfunction due to PAH, or life-threatening haemoptysis ERS, European Respiratory Society; ESC, European Society GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.In prospective studies, the incidence of atrial arrhythmias was 3 -25% over an observation time of 5 years in cohorts primarily containing patients with IPAH [479 -481]. In the absence of specific evidence for PAH, managing anticoagulation in patients with PAH and atrial arrhythmia should follow the recommendations for patients with other cardiac conditions [477]. Patients with PAH are especially sensitive to haemodynamic stress during atrial arrhythmias due to tachycardia and loss of atrioventricular synchrony. Maintaining sinus rhythm is an important treatmentobjective in these patients. New-onset arrhythmias frequently lead to clinical deterioration and areassociated with increased mortality [481]. Observational studies have shown that a variety of rhythmcontrol strategies are feasible, including pharmacological cardioversion with anti-arrhythmic drugs,electrical cardioversion, and invasive catheter ablation procedures. To achieve or maintain a stable sinusrhythm, prophylaxis with anti-arrhythmic drugs without negative inotropic effects, such as oralamiodarone, should be considered, even if specific data regarding their efficacy are lacking. Low-dosebeta-blockers and/or digoxin may be used on an individual patient basis. Catheter ablation is the preferred approach in managing atrial flutter and some other atrial tachycardias, although catheter ablation in patients with PAH is often more technically challenging than in patients with a structurally normal right heart chamber [482]. The safety and efficacy of ablation techniques for atrialfibrillation specifically in the PAH population are uncertain, and it is possible that, due to remodelling ofthe RA, non-pulmonary vein triggers may play a more important role than in patients without PAH [483]. 6.3.10.2. Haemoptysis Haemoptysis, ranging from mild to life-threatening, may occur in all forms of PH but is particularly commonin HPAH and PAH associated with CHD. Pulmonary bleeding frequently originates from enlarged bronchialarteries [484 -486]; hence, the diagnostic evaluation of patients with PAH and haemoptysis should include a contrast-enhanced CT scan with an arterial phase. Even if the source of bleeding cannot be determined,embolization of enlarged bronchial arteries is recommended in patients who present with moderate-to-severehaemoptysis or recurrent episodes of mild haemoptysis. Lung transplant should be considered in patients withrecurrent and severe haemoptysis despite optimized treatment. 6.3.10.3. Mechanical complications Mechanical complications in patients with PAH usually arise from progressive dilatation of the PA andinclude PA aneurysms, rupture, and dissection, and compression of adjacent structures such as the leftmain coronary artery, pulmonary veins, main bronchi, and recurrent laryngeal nerves [487 -492]. Pulmonary artery aneurysm was independently related to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in one study [492]. Symptoms and signs are non-specific; in most cases, patients are asymptomatic and these complications are incidentally diagnosed. Pulmonary artery aneurysms are usually detected during echocardiography and best visualized by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Treatment options for asymptomatic PA aneurysm or PAdissection are not well defined. LTx has to be considered on an individual basis [490, 493]. For patients with left main coronary artery compression syndrome, percutaneous coronary stenting is an effective and safe treatment [62]. For patients with asymptomatic left main coronary artery compression ornon-severe compromise of its anatomy, evaluation with intravascular ultrasound or coronary pressure wiremay help to avoid unnecessary interventions [494]. 6.3.11. End-of-life care and ethical issues The clinical course of PAH may be characterized by progressive deterioration and occasional episodes ofacute decompensation. Life expectancy is difficult to predict, as patients may either die slowly because ofprogressive right HF or experience sudden death. Patient-orientated care is essential in managing PAH. Information about disease severity and possible prognosis should be provided at initial diagnosis but empathic and hopeful communication, as well asyielding hope, is essential, in line with Section 6.3.1.8. At the right time, open and sensitivecommunication will enable advanced planning and discussion of a patient 's fears, concerns, and wishes, and will ultimately contribute to making the final, well-informed, and joint decision about treatment withthe medical team. Patients approaching end of life require frequent assessment of their full needs by a multidisciplinary team. In advanced stages, recognizing that cardiopulmonary resuscitation in severe PAH has a poor outcome may https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 66EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.enable a do not resuscitate order; this may facilitate patients being in their preferred place of care at end of life. Attention should be given to controlling distressing symptoms and prescribing appropriate drugs whilewithdrawing medication that is no longer needed, which may include PAH medication. Well-informedpsychological, social, and spiritual support is also vital. Specialist palliative care should be consulted forpatients whose needs are beyond the expertise of the PH team [346]. 6.3.12. New drugs in advanced clinical development (phase 3 studies) Pulmonary arterial hypertension remains an incurable condition with a high mortality rate, despite use ofPAH drugs mainly targeting imbalance of vasoactive factors. Novel agents, which are currently in phase 3development, are ralinepag and sotatercept. Ralinepag is an orally available prostacyclin receptor agonist,which, in a phase 2 RCT that included 61 patients with PAH, improved PVR compared with placebo after22 weeks of therapy [495]. Sotatercept \u2014a fusion protein comprising the extracellular domain of the human activin receptor type IIA linked to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 \u2014acts as a ligand trap for members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)- superfamily, thus restoring balance between growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting pathways [496]. In a phase 2 RCT that included 106 patients withPAH treated over 24 weeks, s.c. sotatercept reduced PVR in patients receiving background PAH therapy[496]; improvements were also observed in 6MWD and NT-proBNP [496]. 7. Specific pulmonary arterial hypertension subsets 7.1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with drugs and toxinsSeveral drugs and toxins are associated with developing PAH or PVOD/PCH. Historically, certain appetitesuppressants and toxic rapeseed oil were the most prominent examples, whereas methamphetamines,interferons, and some tyrosine kinase inhibitors are more common causes nowadays (Table 7). Pulmonaryarterial hypertension is a rare complication in patients exposed to these drugs, and many of these drugshave also been linked to other pulmonary complications such as parenchymal lung disease or pleural effusions. These pulmonary complications may occur concurrently. Methamphetamine-associated PAH has mainly been reported from the USA, where some centres have found that 20 -29% of their otherwise idiopathic cases of PAH were associated with methamphetamine use [497, 498]. Compared with patients with IPAH, those with methamphetamine-associated PAH had moresevere haemodynamic impairment and a higher mortality risk [498]. Alpha and beta interferons have alsobeen associated with developing PAH [499]. The same is true of some tyrosine or toxin-induced PAH should always be considered in patients presenting with unexplained exertional dyspnoea or other warning signs. The diagnostic approach should be the same as in other formsof PH, and the diagnosis is usually made by excluding other forms of PH in patients who have beenexposed to drugs associated with developing PAH. Treatment of DPAH follows the same basic principles as treating other forms of PAH. Importantly, partial or full reversal of PAH has been reported after discontinuing the causative agent, at least for interferons anddasatinib [499, 500]. Hence, management of the patient should include discontinuing thepresumed causative agents once PAH is diagnosed (also see the 2022 ESC Guidelines on Cardio-Oncology)[501]. In patients with mild PH and a low-risk profile, discontinuing the trigger alone may be sufficient, and itis recommended that these patients be observed over 3 -4 months before considering PAH therapy. Pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy should be initiated in patients who do not normalize their haemodynamics afterwithdrawing or in patients presenting with more advanced PAH at diagnosis. Unlike in other forms of PAH,de-escalation of PAH therapy is often possible during the course of the disease [500]. Physicians should bearin mind that DPAH may have features of PVOD/PCH, especially in patients treated with alkylating agentssuch as mitomycin C or cyclophosphamide.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a well-known pulmonary complication 's syndrome [509]. Conversely, the relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and PAH is not established [510]. After IPAH, PAH-CTD is the second most prevalent type of PAH in westerncountries [511]. Systemic sclerosis, particularly in its limited variant, represents the main cause of PAH-CTD in Europe and the USA (SLE being more common in Asia) [173, 502, 506]. The prevalence of pre-capillary PH in largecohorts of patients with SSc is 5 -19% [173, 502]. In these patients, PH may occur in association with ILD [504, 512] or as a result of PAH [173, 502 -504, 506], sometimes with features of venous/capillary involvement [504, 513]. Moreover, group 2 PH-LHD is also common due to myocardial SSc involvement[504, 514]. Of note, patients with SLE may also present with PAH, LHD, ILD, and CTEPH (mostly in thesetting of antiphospholipid syndrome). It is therefore essential to carefully determine which mechanism isoperative in a given patient, since this will dictate treatment in the context of a multifaceted disease. Cluster analysis performed in patients with SSc has shown that pre-capillary PH can be characterized into distinct clusters that differ in prognosis [503]. One cluster, characterized by the presence of extensive ILD,and another by severely impaired haemodynamics carried a dismal prognosis, while the two others showedeither the absence of ILD or the presence of limited ILD, with mild-to-moderate risk PAH and a relativelyfavourable overall prognosis [503]. 7.2.1. Epidemiology and diagnosis There is a strong female predominance in PAH-CTD (female/male ratio 4:1), and mean age at iscommonly >50 years, especially in SSc [173, 502 -511, 513, 515, 516]. In the setting of a CTD, patients may present with concomitant disorders such as ILD, and have shorter survival compared with patientswith IPAH [503]. The unadjusted risk of death for PAH-SSc compared with IPAH is 2.9, and thepredictors of outcome are broadly similar to those for IPAH [516, 517]. Symptoms and clinicalpresentation are also similar to IPAH, and some patients thought to have IPAH can be identified as havingan associated CTD by careful clinical examination and immunological screening tests. Chest CT isrecommended for evaluating the presence of associated ILD or PVOD/PCH [504, 513, 515]. An isolatedreduction of PAH-CTD [173, 502 -504]. Resting echocardiography combined with other tests is recommended as a screening test in asymptomatic patients with SSc, followed by annual assessments. Screening/early detection is discussed in Section 5.3.1.In other CTDs, PH screening in the absence of suggestive symptoms is not recommended, whileechocardiography should be performed in the presence of symptoms. As in other forms of PAH, RHC isrecommended in all cases of suspected PAH-CTD to confirm diagnosis, determine severity, and rule outLHD [504]. 7.2.2. Therapy Drugs for PAH should be prescribed in PAH-CTD according to the same treatment algorithm as in IPAH(Figure 9). Patients with PAH-CTD have been included in most of the major RCTs for regulatory approvalof PAH therapy [518]. Some aspects of PAH-CTD treatment differ according to the associated CTD [506].Immunosuppressive therapy combining glucocorticosteroids and cyclophosphamide may result in clinicalimprovement in patients with SLE- or mixed CTD-associated PAH [506], while it is not recommended in https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 68EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.PAH-SSc [519]. Patients with SSc and other CTDs may have ILD and/or HFpEF, which needs to be considered when initiating PAH therapy [504, 515]. In SSc, the long-term risk/benefit ratio of oralanticoagulation is unfavourable because of an increased risk of bleeding, while VKAs are recommended inPAH-CTD with a thrombophilic predisposition ( e.g.antiphospholipid syndrome) [319]. Subgroup analyses of patients with PAH-SSc enrolled in RCTs performed with monotherapy or combination stimulators, prostacyclin receptor agonists, epoprostenol, and prostacyclinanalogues shown positive effects versus placebo [301, 401, 519, 520]. In some of these trials, the magnitude of the response in the PAH-CTD subgroup was lower than in the IPAH subgroup [519, 520].Continuous i.v. epoprostenol therapy improved in a3-month RCT in PAH-SSc [401]. However, a retrospective analysis showed a better effect of i.v. epoprostenolon survival in IPAH compared with PAH-SSc [521]. The choice of PAH therapy in the context of SSc and itssystemic manifestations may consider other vascular damage such as digital ulcers [522]. Connective tissue disease should not be considered as an a priori contraindication for LTx [523]. This has been extensively studied in SSc, where a multidisciplinary approach optimizing SSc management before,during, and after surgery is recommended [523]. Indications and contraindications for transplantation have to be adapted to the specificities of CTD, with a special focus on digestive (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and intestinal disease), cardiac, renal, and cutaneous involvement [523].

Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and advances in managing opportunisticinfections have contributed to increased life expectancy in patients with HIV [525, 526]. Consequently, thespectrum of complications has shifted towards other long-term conditions, including PAH. Clinical andhistopathological findings in PAH associated with HIV infection (PAH-HIV) share many similarities withIPAH [1, 527]. With the availability of HAART given in combination with PAH therapies, the prognosisof PAH-HIV has markedly improved in recent years [526, 528]. In addition, the incidence of PAH-HIV has declined in parallel with the increasing availability of HAART [528]. Taken together, these effects on survival and incidence have resulted in a stable PAH prevalence in patients with HIV over recent decades.A French population study indicated that the prevalence of PAH in individuals with HIV infection was0.46%, which is very similar to the prevalence before the HAART era [177]. The pathogenesis of PAH-HIV remains unclear. There is no evidence of a direct role of HIV in the pathogenesis of PAH and, although present in inflammatory cells in the lungs, the virus itself has neverbeen found in pulmonary vascular lesions of patients with PAH-HIV [529]. This suggests that an indirectaction of viral infection on inflammation and growth factors may act as a trigger in a predisposed patient. 7.3.1. Diagnosis Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with HIV shares a clinical presentation with IPAH. Before theavailability of HAART most patients were in WHO-FC III or IV at diagnosis. Nowadays, patients arediagnosed with much less severe symptoms and haemodynamics. Patients may present with other riskfactors for PAH such as liver disease (chronic viral hepatitis B or C) or exposure to drugs or toxins.Patients with PAH-HIV are more likely to be male and i.v. drug abusers [403, 526]. There is no correlationbetween the severity of PAH and the stage of HIV infection or the degree of immunodeficiency [403,530]. Because of its low prevalence, asymptomatic patients with HIV should not be screened for PAH.However, echocardiography should be performed in patients with unexplained dyspnoea to detectHIV-related cardiovascular complications such as myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, or PAH. Right heartcatheterization is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of PAH-HIV and to rule out LHD [527]. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 69EUROPEAN ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.Pulmonary arterial hypertension is an independent risk factor for death in patients with HIV. In the 1990s, before the availability of HAART, patients with PAH-HIV had poor outcomes, with a 3 year survival of<50% [403]. The overall survival has now improved and patients with PAH-HIV have a better prognosisthan most patients with other forms of PAH [526]. 7.3.2. Therapy Current recommendations for the treatment of PAH-HIV are largely based on data from IPAH [25, 26]. Treatment of PAH-HIV with HAART has improved functional status and survival in some retrospective studies [525, 526, 531]. The use of HAART in PAH-HIV is therefore recommended, irrespective of viralload and CD4+ cell count. Anticoagulation is not recommended because of an increased risk of bleeding and drug interactions [319, 527]. Patients with PAH-HIV are usually non-responders to acute vasoreactivity testing and therefore should notreceive CCBs [378]. The prospective, open-label, BREATHE-4 study showed that bosentan markedly improved WHO-FC, exercise capacity, quality of life, and haemodynamics after 16 weeks in patients with PAH-HIV [532]. In along-term, retrospective series, bosentan therapy was associated with haemodynamic normalization in 10/ 59 patients [533]. Bosentan potentially interacts with antiretroviral drugs, and close monitoring is required when combined with HAART. Very few patients with PAH-HIV have been included in RCTs withambrisentan and macitentan, and no definite conclusion can be drawn from those studies. Positive effects of sildenafil and tadalafil in PAH-HI V have been established in case studies [534, 535]. Interactions have been reported between PDE5is and prot ease inhibitors, resulting i n major increases in PDE5i concentrations; these drugs should be introduced at low dosages with careful monitoring of potential side effects,including hypotension [536, 537]. There are no data on the use of the sGC stimulator riociguat in PAH-HIV. Treatment with i.v. epoprostenol resulted in significant improvement in WHO-FC, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and survival in selected patients with PAH-HIV [403, 538]. There are very few data onthe use of i.v. or s.c. treprostinil or inhaled iloprost in PAH-HIV [539, 540]. There are no clinical trial data on the use of combination therapy for PAH-HIV. Given the lack of supporting evidence and potential safety concerns when PAH drugs are co-administered with antiretroviraldrugs, initial monotherapy with PAH medication is recommended, followed by an individualized use ofcombination therapy in patients who do not reach a low-risk profile.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with portal hypertension Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with portal hypertension, commonly referred to as PoPH,develops in 2 -6% of patients with portal hypertension, with or without liver disease. In PAH registries, PoPH represents 5 -15% of the patients [543 -545]. Rarely, some patients with PoPH have portosystemic shunts [546]. However,PoPH is characterized by intrapulmonaryvascular dilatations and hypoxaemia. Of note, HPS and PoPH can or concurrently inpatients with portal hypertension [547]. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 70EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.7.4.1. Diagnosis The diagnosis of PoPH is based on the presence of otherwise unexplained pre-capillary PH in patients withportal hypertension or a portosystemic shunt. The diagnostic approach is the same as in other patients withsuspected or newly detected PH. Transthoracic echocardiography is usually the first non-invasiveassessment in patients with suspected PH, and echocardiography is also recommended as a screening toolin patients evaluated for liver transplantation. As patients with liver disease often have an elevated CO,TRV tends to overestimate PAP in these patients. Hence, RHC with comprehensive haemodynamicassessment is essential to confirm the diagnosis of PH and to distinguish PAH (with elevated PVR) fromunclassified PH (with a normal PVR). 7.4.2. Therapy Patients with unclassified PH ( i.e.mPAP >20 mmHg, elevated CO, and PVR 2.0 WU) should be regularly followed-up but should not be treated with drugs approved for PAH. In patients with an established diagnosis of PoPH, treatment should follow the same general principles as in other patients with PAH, taking into account the severity of underlying liver disease, the indication for livertransplantation, and the potential effects of PAH medication on gas exchange, which may deteriorate withvasodilators in patients with PoPH [548, 549]. All drugs approved for PAH can principally be used to treatpatients with PoPH, bearing in mind that these patients are usually excluded from registration studies.Nevertheless, various case series support the use of approved PAH medication in patients with PoPH. Thelargest series published so far reported on 574 patients with PoPH treated with various PAH drugs, mostlyPDE5is or ERAs, alone and in combination [545]. Most patients (56.8%) were in Child -Pugh class A at the time of PAH diagnosis. At the first follow-up, which took place 4.5 months after starting treatment,improvements were seen in haemodynamics, WHO-FC, 6MWD, and BNP/NT-proBNP; survival at 5 yearswas 51%. In patients presenting with mild liver disease, the main causes of death were PAH progression andmalignancy, whereas complications of liver disease were the most common causes of death in patients withadvanced liver disease. The 5 year survival of patients who underwent liver transplantation ( n=63) was 81%. The only RCT dedicated to the treatment of PoPH was PORTICO, a 12 week study that randomized 85 patients to macitentan ( n=43) or placebo ( n=42) [168]. PORTICO met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant reduction in PVR from baseline (ratio of geometric mean 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59 -0.72; P<0.0001). There were, however, no differences between the two treatment groups in secondary outcome measures, including WHO-FC, 6MWD, and NT-proBNP. 7.4.2.1. Liver transplantation Porto-pulmonary hypertension is not per se an indication for liver transplantation. Pulmonary arterialhypertension poses a major threat to patients who undergo liver transplantation when indicated for theseverity of liver disease. In a historical series from the Mayo Clinic, severe PAH with mPAP 50 mmHg was associated with a 100% peri-operative mortality rate. In patients with mPAP 35 -50 mmHg and PVR >3.0 WU, mortality was still 50% [550]. In liver transplantation candidates with PAH, targeted medicaltherapy successfully improves haemodynamics and establishes eligibility for transplantation [545, 551 - 554]. However, haemodynamic criteria for successful liver transplantation have not been firmly established. The International Liver Transplant Society proposed haemodynamic targets of mPAP <35 mmHg and PVR<5 WU, or mPAP 35 mmHg and PVR <3 WU in patients receiving PAH therapy, while acknowledging that these criteria need to be further validated [175]. An mPAP 45 mmHg is regarded as an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation [175]. In patients with PoPH who successfully underwent liver transplantation, de-escalation or discontinuation of PAH medication is often feasible, but this has to be performed on an individual basis [551, 554].

Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with adult congenital heart disease The presence of PH in adults with CHD has a negative impact on the natural course of CHD, and worsensclinical status and overall outcome [555]. Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with adult CHD isincluded in group 1 of the PH clinical classification (Table 6) and represents a heterogeneous patientpopulation. Post-capillary PH in adult CHD ( e.g.systolic or diastolic, systemic, ventricular dysfunction in combination with shunt lesions or complex adult CHD, and systemic atrioventricular valve dysfunction)should be excluded to determine further management. A specific clinical classification (Table 21) isprovided to better characterize PAH associated with adult CHD. Some complex CHDs are associated withcongenital abnormalities of the pulmonary vascular tree leading to segmental PH. In segmental PH, one ormore, but not all, segments of the lung(s) are hypertensive and each hypertensive area may present withPH of different severity, while other parts of the lung vasculature may be hypoplastic. Pulmonary atresiawith ventricular septal defect and collaterals is the most frequent condition, butother complex CHDs may also lead to segmental PH. Approximately 3 -7% of patients with adult CHD will eventually develop PAH; it is more frequently encountered in females, and the incidence depends on the underlying lesion and increases with age andage at defect closure [556]. The estimated prevalence of PAH in patients after correcting a simple cardiacdefect is 3% [557]. The epidemiology of PAH associated with adult CHD is expected to change due to TABLE 21 Clinical classification of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease 1) Eisenmenger syndrome Includes all large intra- and extracardiac defects that begin as systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and progress to severely elevated PVR and to reverse (pulmonary-to-systemic) or bidirectional shunting. Cyanosis, secondaryerythrocytosis, and multiple organ involvement are usually present. Closing the defects is contraindicated. 2) PAH associated with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts \u0081Correctable a \u0081Non-correctable Include moderate-to-large defects. PVR is mildly to moderately increased and systemic-to-pulmonary shunting is still prevalent, whereas cyanosis at rest is not a feature. 3) PAH with small/coincidentalbdefects Markedly elevated PVR in the presence of cardiac defects considered haemodynamically non-significant(usually septal defects <1 cm and atrial <2 cm of effective diameter assessed by echocardiography), which themselves do not account for the development of elevated PVR. The clinical picture is very similar to IPAH. Closing the defects is contraindicated. 4) PAH after defect correction Congenital heart disease is repaired, but PAH either persists immediately after correction or recurs/develops months or years after correction in the absence of significant, post-operative, haemodynamic lesions. surgery or intravascular percutaneous procedure, see also the Recommendation Table 18 for shunt closure.bThe size applies to adult patients. However, also in adults, the simple diameter may be insufficient for defining the haemodynamic relevance of the defect, and also the pressure gradient, the shunt size and direction, and the pulmonary-to-systemic flows ratio should be considered. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 72EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.advances in diagnostic and therapeutic paediatric cardiology, resulting in fewer patients with simple adult CHD and more patients with complex lesions and/or closed defects who develop PAH in adulthood [558]. The clinical presentation of Eisenmenger syndrome, an advanced form of adult CHD-associated PAH, is characterized by the multiorgan effects of chronic hypoxaemia, including cyanosis, and haematologicalchanges, including secondary erythrocytosis and thrombocytopenia; the main symptoms are dyspnoea,fatigue, and syncope. Eisenmenger syndrome may also present with haemoptysis, chest pain,cerebrovascular accidents, brain abscesses, coagulation abnormalities, and sudden death. Patients with adultCHD and Down syndrome are at an increased risk of developing Eisenmenger syndrome. 7.5.1. Diagnosis and risk assessment The diagnostic work-up of PAH associated with adult CHD should be based on the presence of symptoms and includes medical history, physical examination, PFTs, ABG, imaging (especiallyechocardiography), and exercise and labo ratory testing. Of note, standard echocardiographic criteria for detecting PH may not be applicable in complex adul t CHD [559]. Right heart catheterization with compartmental oximetry for calculating pulmonary bl ood flow/systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) is required to confirm PAH diagnosis and guide therapeutic interventions. Thermodilution should be avoided in the presence of intracardiac shunts, and direct Fick is the most accurate method. Pulmonary vascularresistance may be overestimated due to erythrocytosis [560]. Interpreting invasive haemod ynamics (see Section 5.1.12) should be made in the context of multiparametric assessment of exercise capacity,laboratory testing, and imaging. Predictors of worse outcomes in adult CHD-associated PAH are WHO-FC III -IV, exercise intolerance assessed by 6MWD or peak VO 2, history of hospitalization echocardiographic indices RV dysfunction [559, 561]. When compared with patientswith IPAH, patients with Eisenmenger syndrome may have a relatively stable long-term clinical course.The right ventricle is unloaded by the right-to-left shunt, sustaining CO at the expense of hypoxaemia andcyanosis. However, due to immortal time bias, prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome is not as favourable aspreviously thought [562]. As in other forms of PAH, risk assessment is important to guide therapy, and specific risk factors have been described in Eisenmenger syndrome. A large multicentre study showed that mortality in adults withEisenmenger syndrome was predicted by the presence of pre-tricuspid shunt, advancing age, low restoxygen saturation, absence of sinus rhythm, and presence of pericardial effusion [563]. 7.5.2. Therapy Outcomes in adult CHD-associated PAH have improved with the availability of new PAH therapies,advances in surgical and peri-operative management, and a team-based, multidisciplinary approach in PHcentres. These patients should be managed by specialized health professionals. Patient education,behavioural modifications, and social and psychological support are all important aspects of management. Shunt closure (surgical or interventional) may only be considered in patients with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunting without significantly increased PVR. Criteria for defect closure based onQp/Qs ratio and (baseline and/or after targeted PAH treatment) PVR have been proposed by the 2020 ESCGuidelines for the management of adult congenital heart disease [101]. Decisions on shunt closure shouldnot be made on haemodynamic numbers alone, and a multiparametric strategy should be followed. Forinstance, shunt closure is not indicated in the case of desaturation during exercise in the 6MWT or CPET,or when there is secondary erythrocytosis suggesting dynamic reversal of shunt. There is no evidence for along-term benefit of a treat-and-repair approach in patients with adult CHD-associated PAH with prevalentsystemic-to-pulmonary shunts; therefore, there is a need for future prospective studies [564]. Defect closureis contraindicated in all patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, and may also adversely affect patients withsmall/coincidental defects that behave similarly to IPAH [565]. There are no prospective data available onthe usefulness of vasoreactivity testing, balloon closure testing, or lung biopsy for assessing operability andnormalization of PVR after closure [566]. Patients with adult CHD-associated PAH may present with clinical deterioration in different circumstances, such as arrhythmia, during non-car diac surgery requiring general anaesthesia, dehydration or bleeding, thrombo-embolism, and l ung infections. Surgeries s hould be limited to those deemed essential, and performed in specialized centres with anaesthetists experienced in adult CHDand PAH. Endocarditis should be suspected in patients with sepsis, whereas a cerebral abscess should https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 73EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.be excluded in those with neurological symptoms or new headache, especially in those with low oxygen saturations and complex anatomies. It is recommended to avoid strenuous exercise, but mildand moderate activities seem to be beneficial [567]. Patients should receive all recommendedvaccinations and endocarditis prophylaxis in the presence of cyanosis. Although pregnant patients withleft-to-right shunts and stable, well-controlled PAH have tolerated pregnancy well under specializedcare, pregnancy is still associated with both high maternal mortality and foetal complications inEisenmenger syndrome and should be discouraged in this setting [568, 569]; hence, effectivecontraception is highly recommended. Levonorgestrel-based, long-acting, reversible contraception implants or intrauterine devices have been recommended for these patients [570]. Secondary erythrocytosis is beneficial for adequate oxygen transport and delivery, and routine phlebotomy should be avoided whenever possible. Symptoms of hyperviscosity in the presence of haematocrit >65%should be approached with appropriate hydration. Iron deficiency should be corrected. When i.v. ironsupplementation is administered, special care should be taken to avoid air emboli during administration[571]. Supplemental oxygen therapy has not been shown to impact survival. Oral anticoagulant treatment with VKAs may be considered in patients with large PA aneurysms with thrombus, atrial arrhythmias, a nd previous thrombo-embolic eve nts, but with low bleeding risk. In patients with very high Hb levels (>20 mg/dL), standard international normalized ratio measures areless accurate, and citrate-adjusted blood bottles must be used. Regarding using novel oral antico agulants (NOACs), a large, nationwide, German, adult CHD d atabase (including 106 NOAC-treated patients with Eisenmenger syndrome) showed that NOAC us ers had higher long-term risk of bleeding, major adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality compared with those on VKAs, suggesting that initiatingNOACs should be reserved for experienced adult CH D centres, carefully weighing potential benefits and risks [572, 573]. Compared with other group 1 subgroups, limited data exist on the use of drugs approved for PAH in patients with adult CHD-associated PAH. Bosentan improved 6MWD and decreased PVR in patients withEisenmenger syndrome in WHO-FC III [574]. Patients with more complex lesions were less likely torespond to PAH therapies compared with patients with simple lesions. An RCT investigating the efficacyof macitentan found no effect on 6MWD in a mixed cohort of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome(6MWD improved in both treatment and placebo arms), although decreases in NT-proBNP and PVR werenoted in the macitentan arm [575]. Experiences with other ERAs and PDE5is have shown favourable functional and haemodynamic results in Eisenmenger syndrome [576]. In a small, single-centre, pilot study, adding nebulized iloprost to abackground of oral PAH therapy failed to improve 6MWD in Eisenmenger syndrome [577]. In casesymptoms persist or in clinical deterioration, a sequential and symptom-orientated treatment strategy isrecommended in Eisenmenger syndrome, starting with an oral ERA (or PDE5i) and escalating therapy.Should symptoms not adequately improve with oral therapies, i.v./s.c. options should be proactivelyconsidered [578]. There is a theoretical risk of paradoxical embolism in right-to-left shunt lesions with thepresence of venous catheter for i.v. therapy; therefore, s.c. prostacyclin analogue infusion may beconsidered. The effect of PAH therapies in patients with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts is less well established. Patients with small/coincidental defects should be treated with PAH medication [557]. This isalso the case for patients with PAH after defect correction who have increased mortality compared withthose with Eisenmenger syndrome [579]. These patients were included in major RCTs with PAH therapiesand should be evaluated based on comprehensive risk assessment (Table 16) [580]. The effect of PAHtherapies in patients with segmental PH remains a matter of debate [101, 581]. While some series have reported promising results, there have been cases where therapies were not tolerated [581]. Similarly, using PAH therapies in Fontan circulation has yielded conflicting results, and results of further studies areawaited [582 -584]. Heart -lung transplantation or LTx with heart surgery is an option in highly selected cases not responsive to medical treatment; however, it is limited by organ availability and lesion complexity. Mortality is highduring the first year after surgery, especially after heart -lung transplantation, but remains relatively low thereafter [585]. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 74EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with schistosomiasis Schistosomiasis is one of the most common chronic infectious diseases worldwide, affecting around 200million people [586, 587]. Schistosomiasis-associated PAH is present in 5% of patients with thehepatosplenic form of the disease [586]. It is thus a leading cause of PAH, especially in some regions ofSouth America, Africa, and Asia. Compared with patients with IPAH, patients withschistosomiasis-associated PAH present with higher CO and lower PVR, and have a better survival [587].Registry data suggest that survival in schistosomiasis-associated PAH has improved in recent years withthe use of PAH drugs [588]. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 75EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.7.7. Pulmonary arterial hypertension with signs of venous/capillary involvement The common risk factors, identical genetic substrate, and indistinguishable clinical presentations of PCHand PVOD necessitate their consideration as a single disease belonging to the group 1 PH spectrum ofdiseases (PAH with signs of venous/capillary involvement) [1, 425, PVOD/PCH, post-capillarylesions occlude the lumen [1, 425, 589, 590]. changes are frequently associated with PCHconsisting of capillary ectasia and proliferation, with doubling and tripling of the alveolar septal capillarylayers that may be focally distributed within the interstitium [425, 590]. The proportion of patients with IPAH that fulfil the criteria for PVOD/PCH is 10%, resulting in a lowest estimate of PVOD/PCH incidence and prevalence of <1 case/million [425]. In contrast to IPAH, there is amale predominance in PVOD/PCH and its prognosis is worse [425, 589, 591]. Familial PVOD/PCHtypically occurs in the young siblings of one generation, with unaffected and sometimes consanguineousparents, indicating that the disease segregates as a recessive trait [158, 425, heritable PVOD/PCH [158]. In addition, PVOD/PCH can complicate the course of associated conditions, such as SSc [425], or be associated with exposure to environmental triggers, such asalkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, mitomycin C) [34] and solvents complain of non-specific dyspnoea on exertion and fatigue [590]. Physical examination 591]. The PAWP is notelevated because the pulmonary vascular changes occur in small venulae and capillaries, while the LAfilling pressure remains normal [590, 591]. A diagnosis of PVOD/PCH is based on the results of testssuggesting venous post-capillary chronic interstitial pulmonary These are at risk of drug-induced pulmonary oedema with PAH therapy, a finding suggestive of PVOD/PCH [425, 591]. Detecting biallelic EIF2AK4 mutations of heritable PVOD/PCH [158, 591, 592]. Lung biopsy is hazardous is not recommended for diagnosingPVOD/PCH [1, 425]. 7.7.2. Therapy There is no established medical for PVOD/PCH [425]. Compared with IPAH, PVOD/PCH has apoor prognosis and limited response to PAH therapy, with a risk of pulmonary oedema due to pulmonary venous obstruction [425, 591]. However, there are reports of incomplete and transient clinical improvement in individual patients with PVOD/PCH treated with PAH therapy, which should be used with great cautionin this setting [425, 591]. Diuretics, oxygen therapy, and slow titration of PAH therapy can be used on anindividual basis [425]. Therefore, therapy for PVOD/PCH should be undertaken at centres with extensiveexperience in managing PH, and patients should be fully informed about the risks [425]. Anecdotal reportssuggest a potential benefit of immunomodulatory treatments, but this approach requires further study [593].The only curative therapy for PVOD/PCH is LTx, and eligible patients should be referred to a transplantcentre for evaluation upon diagnosis [425, 591]. Pathological examination of the explanted lungs willconfirm the diagnosis [590].

Paediatric pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension may present at all ages, including in infants and children. Pulmonary hypertensionin childhood shares many common features with PH in adulthood; however, there are also importantdifferences, which concern epidemiology, aetiology, genetic background, age-dependent diagnostic andtreatment approaches, and disease monitoring. An important and conceptually distinctive feature ofpaediatric PH is injury to developing foetal, neonatal, or paediatric lung circulation. 7.8.1. Epidemiology and classification The reported annual incident rate for paediatric PH is 64/million children [594]. The distribution of thevarious aetiologies of PH in childhood differs from PH in adulthood [594 -596]. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is the most frequent type of PH in children, with the vast majority (82%) of cases beinginfants with transient PAH ( i.e.PPHN or repairable cardiac shunt defects). Of the remaining children with PAH, most have either IPAH, HPAH, or irreversible CHD-associated PAH. The reported (non-transient) CHD-associated PAH are 0.7 and 2.2/million children, respectively, witha prevalence of 4.4 and 15.6/million children, respectively [594]. Other conditions associated with PAH(Table 6) do occur in children but are rare. Another significant proportion (34 -49%) of children with non-transient PH are neonates and infants with PH associated with respiratory disease, especially developmental lung diseases, children form a prominent and distinctive group in paediatric PH and are currently classified as PH group 3 associated with developmental lung disease (Table 6; Table S7).A significant and growing proportion of children with PH associated with respiratory disease is made up ofpre-term infants with BPD. Also, newly recognized genetic developmental lung disorders \u2014including alveolar dysplasia, TBX4 -mutation-related lung disorders, and surfactant \u2014are currently classified in this category (Figure 10) [599]. Another distinctive feature of PH in children is the high burden of genetic disorders. Childhood PH is often associated with chromosomal, genetic, and syndromic anomalies (11 -52%). Like in adults, gene mutations implicated in the pathogenesis of HPAH are found in 20 -30% of sporadic cases, where paediatric HPAH seems to be characterized by an enrichment in TBX4 andACVRL1 variations [600, 601]. Additionally, 17% of children with PAH have other disorders known to be associated with PAH, including trisomy 21. Finally, 23% of children with PAH have copy number variations not previously associatedwith PH [600, 602, 603]. Given the frequent association of paediatric PAH with chromosomal, genetic, and syndromic anomalies (for which the mechanistic basis for PAH is generally uncertain), genetic testing may be considered fordefining aetiology and comorbidities, stratifying risk, and identifying family members at risk; however, thisshould be after appropriate expert genetic counselling for the child and family (see Section 5.1.13). The clinical PH classification (Table 6) is also followed for paediatric PH. To improve applicability of this classification in infants and children with PH, it has been adapted to give room to PH associated withvarious congenital cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases or specific paediatric conditions (Tables S5 -S8) [599]. 7.8.2. Diagnosis and risk assessment Historically, the definition of PH in children aged >3 months has been the same as in adults. Thedefinition for PH has now been redefined to mPAP >20 mmHg in adults as well as in children. The impactof an mPAP 21 -24 mmHg on outcomes in children is unknown. However, in the interest of consistency and to facilitate transition from paediatric to adult PH care, it is recommended that the updated definition https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 77EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.FIGURE 10 Neonatal and versus PAH associated with connective tissue disease; PAH-HIV, HIV infection; PH, pulmonary hypertension; PoPH,porto-pulmonary hypertension; PPHN, persistent idiopathic, heritable or drug-associated PAH. Pulmonary hypertension in neonates and infants significantly differs in aetiology, pathophysiology, risk assessment, andtreatment from older children and adults, while PH in older children has more similarities with PH in adults. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 78EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.for PH also be followed in children. No treatment recommendations currently exist for this group of children (mPAP 21 -24 mmHg). Regarding the newly introduced criterion to include PVR >2 WU to identify pre-capillary PH in adults, PVR had previously been included in the definition for PAH in children. In children, blood flows aretraditionally indexed assuming that systemic and pulmonary blood flows change proportionally with bodysize, while the transpulmonary pressure gradient does not. Since blood flow is the denominator in theequation for calculating PVR, the need for indexing of PVR in children is emphasized, and the criterion ofpulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) 3 WU\u00b7m 2in the definition for PAH in children remains unchanged [599]. Since the aetiology of paediatric PH is very diverse, a methodical and comprehensive diagnostic approach is crucial to reach an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. As in adults, IPAH is a diagnosis 'per exclusion '. A diagnostic work-up, similar to that in adults but customized for paediatric PH, is recommended [599]. Pre-term infants with BPD should be screened for PH, since PH is prevalent in thispopulation and seriously affects outcome [604]. Also in children, RHC is the gold standard for definitively diagnosing and establishing the nature of PH, and provides important data for stratifying risk [604a, 605]. To identify those suitable for high-dose CCBtreatment, acute vasoreactivity testing is recommended in children with IPAH/HPAH. The criteria used inadults for a positive acute response have identified children who will show sustained benefit from CCBtherapy; however, these criteria do not define reversibility of PAH or operability in children with CHD.Since RHC in children with PH may be associated with major complications (in 1 -3% of cases, especially in young infants and those in worse clinical condition), risks and benefits have to be balanced in theindividual child [605]. Heart catheterization in children with PAH should be exclusively performed inexperienced paediatric PH centres. Indications for repeated RHC in children with PH are currently not welldefined. Treatment of children with PAH is based on risk stratification [599]. Predictors of worse outcome in paediatric PAH are similar to those in adults, and include clinical evidence of RV failure, progression ofsymptoms, WHO-FC III -IV, certain echocardiographic serum NT-proBNP. A 6MWD <350 m has also been suggested as a predictor of worse outcome in paediatric PH,but its value in young children is less established. Further prognosticators identified in paediatric PAH arefailure to thrive and haemodynamic variables, such as RAP >10 mmHg, the ratio validated in observationalpaediatric registries [599, 604a]. 7.8.3. Therapy The ultimate goal of treatment should be to improve survival and facilitate normal childhood activitieswithout limitations. In the absence of RCTs in paediatric PAH, recommended treatment algorithms areextrapolated from those in adults and enhanced with data from observational studies in children withPAH [599]. Observational cohort studies support treatment algorithms designed for adults to be used for children (including the superiority of combination therapy over monotherapy) [608]. Drugs investigated in children,with or without formal approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treating children withPAH, are shown in Table 22. A paediatric treatment algorithm, derived from that for adults, is based on risk stratification, recommending general measures, high-dose CCB therapy for responders to acute vasoreactivity testing (where closefollow-up is mandatory, as some patients may fail long-term therapy), oral or inhaled combination therapyfor children at low risk, and combination therapy with i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogues for those at highrisk [599]. In the case of insufficient response to recommended drug therapy, or when drugs are unavailable, a Potts shunt (a surgical or interventional connection between the left PA and the descending aorta), BAS, or LTxmay be considered in children with severe PH (see Sections 6.3.6.1 and 6.3.8) [599]. Reported clinicalexperience with Potts shunts is limited to just over 100 patients, predominantly children, with a mortalityof 12 -25% and long-term clinical benefit in a subset of children with long-term follow-up [456 -459]. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES HUMBERT ET AL.TABLE 22 Use of pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies in children Drug Paediatric study data European Medicines Agency approval for use in children with PAHRef.

HUMBERT ET AL.Monitoring of treatment effect and disease course is pivotal in managing all patients with PAH (adults and in children). In children with PAH, clinical risk scores including WHO-FC, TAPSE, and serumNT-proBNP are potential treatment targets for goal-orientated treatment [604a, 609]. Contemporary treatment algorithms for infants with PPHN have been proposed but are outside the scope of these guidelines [610]. The recommendations discussed above apply to children with PAH, whereas the specific group of infants with neonatal PVD, mostly classified as PH associated with developmental lung disease and withheterogeneous aetiology, require a distinct and customized approach (Figure 10). In pre-term infants with BPD and PH, the underlying lung disease should primarily be treated. Frequently, these infants are additionally treated with therapies for PAH, including sildenafil and bosentan; however,these are not approved by the EMA for use in infants with group 3 PH and developmental lung diseases(BPD, CDH). Their effects on outcomes in this population are unclear, and data enabling robust treatmentrecommendations are lacking. These children should be treated by multidisciplinary teams involvingcardiologists, neonatologists, pulmonologists, and nutritionists. Pulmonary hypertension in these infants may disappear with lung healing, although long-term cardiovascular sequelae have been reported [611, 612].

Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease (group 2) 8.1. Definition, prognosis, and pathophysiologyAmong patients with LHD, PH and RV dysfunction are frequently present and associated with highmortality [47]. This includes patients with HF with reduced, mildly reduced, or preserved ejection fraction(HFrEF, HFmrEF, or HFpEF), left-sided valvular JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. ET leading to post-capillary PH [13, 631 -635]. Arguably, PH-LHD represents the most prevalent form of PH, accounting for 65 -80% of cases [47]. Consistent with the general definitions of PH, PH-LHD (group 2 PH) is defined by an mPAP >20 mmHg and a PAWP post-capillary defined byPVR2 WU and CpcPH by PVR >2 WU (Table 5). The diastolic pressure gradient (DPG) (calculated as the difference between dPAP and PAWP) is no longer used to distinguish between IpcPH and CpcPHbecause of conflicting data on prognostication in LHD [142]. Across the spectrum of LHD, increases in PAP and PVR are associated with an increased disease burden and a worse outcome [13, 631, 633, 635]. In a large patient cohort \u2014predominantly with post-capillary PH \u2014a PVR 2.2 WU was associated with adverse outcomes and considered abnormal [13]. However, even within this subgroup of patients with LHD and CpcPH, the risk of mortality increases with progressiveelevation in PVR. In patients with advanced HFrEF and those with HFpEF or valvular heart disease, aPVR >5 WU carries additional prognostic information and is considered clinically meaningful byphysicians [142, 450, 631 -639]. Elevated PVR also appears to be associated with decreased survival in special situations, such as in patients undergoing interventions for correcting valvular heart disease [634], heart transplantation [142, 633], or LVAD [142, 637]. Based on available data, a PVR >5 WU may indicate a severe pre-capillary component, the presence of which may prompt physicians torefer patients to PH centres for specialized care. The prevalence of PH in patients with LHD is difficult to assess and depends on the methodology of diagnostic testing (echocardiography or invasive haemodynamics), cut-off values used to define PH, andpopulations studied. Observational studies suggest an estimated prevalence of PH of 40 -72% in patients with HFrEF and 36 -83% in those with HFpEF [48, 639 -643]. When PVR is used to define a pre-capillary component in patients with HF and post-capillary PH, 20-30% of patients are categorized as having CpcPH [47, 644, 645]. In patients with valvular heart disease, echocardiographic studies have shown thatPH is present in up to 65% of patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis [646 -651], while virtually all patients with severe mitral valve stenosis develop PH [652], which can also be found in most patients withsignificant degenerative or functional mitral regurgitation. The pathophysiology of PH-LHD combines several mechanisms (Figure 11): 1) an initial passive increase in LV filling pressures and backward transmission into the pulmonary circulation; 2) PA endothelialdysfunction (including vasoconstriction); 3) vascular remodelling (which may occur in both venules and/orarterioles); 4) RV dilatation/dysfunction and functional TR [653 -656]; 5) altered RV -PA coupling [656, 657]. haemodynamic profile of CpcPH versus IpcPH and elevated PVR reflects pulmonary vascular abnormalities, which contribute to an increased RV afterload. Resulting dysfunction of the RV isfrequent and associated with a worse prognosis in patients with PH-LHD. In HFpEF, where RVdysfunction may occur via distinct mechanisms (Figure S1), deterioration of RV, but not LV systolicfunction, has been observed over time, and both prevalent and incident RV dysfunction are predictors ofmortality [658]. The occurrence of PH in patients with LHD may also be due to other causes, including undetected CTEPH or PAH. Further, respiratory comorbidities such as COPD and sleep apnoea are also common in patientswith LHD and may contribute to PH and impact prognosis. Patients with HFpEF and PH associated withHFpEF [75, 76] may also present with a low DLCO, which is an independent predictor of outcome [75]. 8.2. Diagnosis In patients with LHD, symptoms ( e.g.exertional dyspnoea) and physical signs of PH ( e.g.peripheral oedema) frequently overlap with those of the underlying left heart condition and are mostly non-specific.However, while pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion indicate LHD as the underlying cause of PH,other features may suggest the presence of relevant PH (see Section 5.1.1). Routine diagnostic tests including BNP/NT-proBNP, ECG, and echocardiography may show signs of underlying LHD, but may also indicate PH. While BNP/NT-proBNP cannot discriminate between left- orright-sided HF, ECG findings such as right axis deviation or RV strain may suggest the presence of PH inpatients with LHD. Echocardiography can diagnose HFrEF and HFpEF; identify specific cardiacconditions, including those with restrictive fillin g pattern; and diagnose additional valvular heart disease; it may also detect elevated sPAP and othe r features of PH (RA area, PA enlargement, RV/LV ratio, LV eccentricity index, RV forming the apex), leading to an echocardiographic probability of PH(see Section 5.1.5). A stepwise, composite echocardiographic score may discriminate pre- versus https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 82EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.post-capillary PH and predict PVD in patients with LHD [659, 660]. Additional information may be gathered from further testing, including biomarkers, imaging-derived markers of RV dysfunction, andCPET-derived variables [142]. Given the complexity and variability of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in patients with LHD, the distinction between post- and pre-capillary PH and the diagnosis of PH-LHD versus other forms of PH can be challenging. Diagnostic clues in the evaluation of suspected PH in LHD include: 1) diagnosis andcontrol of the underlying LHD; 2) evaluation for PH and patient phenotyping; and 3) invasivehaemodynamic evaluation, when indicated.

HUMBERT ET AL.8.2.1. Diagnosis and control of the underlying left heart disease Patients with suspected PH-LHD will have an established diagnosis of LHD, such as HFrEF/HFmrEF,HFpEF, valvular heart disease, and/or CHD. The distinction between PH associated with HFpEF and otherforms of PH ( e.g. PAH, CTEPH) may be challenging, particularly given the increased burden of cardiovascular comorbidities in real-world PAH populations [142, 293, 450, H2FPEF) [16, 662, 663] may be helpful for detecting it as anunderlying condition in PH, and the presence or absence of risk factors for PAH or CTEPH should bedetermined. Patients with signs of predominant RV strain and/or PH should be further evaluated. Patientsshould be assessed or reassessed when they are fully recompensated and in a clinically stable condition. 8.2.2. Evaluation of pulmonary hypertension and patient phenotyping Patients with LHD and suspected PH should be evaluated following the diagnostic strategy for PH (seeSection 5). This requires identifying clinical features and a multimodal approach using non-invasivediagnostic tests such as echocardiography, ECG, and BNP/NT-proBNP levels. In the presence of mild PHand predominant LHD, no further testing may be necessary. Otherwise, CTEPH and significant lungdisease should be ruled out by V/Q scan and PFTs, and additional cardiac imaging including cMRI maybe considered in selected cases. For phenotyping, a combination of variables may help to determine thelikelihood of LHD, and HFpEF in particular, versus other causes of PH (Table 23). Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease is likely in the presence of known cardiac disease, multiplecardiovascular comorbidities/risk factors, atrial fibrillation at diagnosis, and specific imaging findings (LVhypertrophy, increased LA size, and reduced LA strain). Although exercise echocardiography has been proposed to uncover HFpEF, it is unable to diagnose or classify PH in this context. A combination of clinical findings and phenotyping is required to decide about the need for further invasive assessment. 8.2.3. Invasive assessment of haemodynamics The decision to perform cardiac catheterization and to invasively assess cardiopulmonary haemodynamics should depend on the presence of an intermediate to high echocardiographic probability of PH, and should be determined by the need to obtain relevant information for prognostication or management. In patientswith a high likelihood of LHD as the main cause of PH, or with established underlying LHD and mild PH(Table 23), invasive assessment for PH is usually not indicated. Indications for RHC in LHD include:(1) suspected PAH or CTEPH; (2) suspected CpcPH with a severe pre-capillary component, where furtherinformation will aid phenotyping and treatment decisions (Figure S2); and (3) advanced HF and evaluationfor heart transplantation. haemodynamic measures pulmonary arterialcompliance [PAC], transpulmonary pressure gradient, DPG) are associated with outcomes in PH-LHD[142, 632, 635], the most robust and consistent data are available for PVR. Invasive assessment should beconducted in experienced centres, when management of the underlying LHD has been optimized andpatients are in a clinically stable condition. With respect to respiratory variations of intrathoracic pressures,all pressure readings should be taken at end-expiration. Additional testing during RHC may be useful for distinguishing between PAH and HFpEF [18, 23, 664-669], and to uncover LHD in patients with a high likelihood of PH-LHD and normal resting PAWP [670 -673]; both exercise testing and fluid challenge may be considered in special situations (see Section 5.1.12). Conditions associated with reduced LV diastolic compliance or valvular heart disease may beassociated with a rapid increase in PAWP when challenged with increased systemic venous return [674].While the upper limit of normal remains controversial [142, 143, 665, 667], a PAWP cut-off of>18 mmHg has been suggested to identify HFpEF as the underlying cause of PH, despite normal PAWP atbaseline [143]. While this may help to classify PH, therapeutic consequences of such testing remain to bedetermined. As differentiating between severe PH associated with HFpEF and IPAH with cardiac comorbidities is challenging, patients with an unclear diagnosis, particularly those with a predominant pre-capillarycomponent ( e.g.PVR >5 WU), should be referred to a PH centre for individualized management. 8.3. Therapy The primary strategy in managing PH-LHD is optimizing treatment of the underlying cardiac disease.Nevertheless, a pathophysiological sequence ranging from left-sided heart disease via pulmonarycirculation to chronic right heart strain (at rest or exercise) is present in many patients [47]. Sincedeterioration of RV function over time is associated with poor outcomes in HFpEF [658], preserving RVfunction should be considered an important treatment goal. Diuretics remain the cornerstone of medicaltherapy in the presence of fluid retention due to PH-LHD. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 84EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.There is limited and conflicting evidence for the use of drugs approved for PAH in patients with group 2 PH. Some medications may have variable and potentially detrimental effects in such patients and are therefore notindicated in PH-LHD. Management strategies for PH in various left heart aetiologies are described below. 8.3.1. Pulmonary hypertension associated with left-sided heart failure 8.3.1.1. Heart failure with reduced ejection fractionPatients with HFrEF or HFmrEF require guideline-directed treatment including established medical andinterventional therapies [27]. In patients with advanced HFrEF, implanting an LVAD may significantlyreduce or even normalize mPAP [675], although this is not achieved in all patients [676], and an increasedDPG emerged as a negative prognostic factor after LVAD implantation [677]. With regards to PAH drugs,bosentan was assessed in an RCT of patients with PH associated with HFrEF [678], showing no efficacybut an increase in adverse events compared with placebo, predominantly related to fluid retention. Smallstudies have suggested that sildenafil may improve haemodynamics and exercise capacity in PH andHFrEF [679 -681], but RCTs are lacking. 8.3.1.2. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction In patients with HFpEF, blood pressure, volume load, and risk factors should be controlled, which maylower filling pressures and PAP [27]. Recently, the SGLT-2i empagliflozin improved outcomes in patientswith an LV ejection fraction of 40 -60% [682]. Endothelin receptor antagonists have not proved successful in this population, as both bosentan [683] and macitentan [684] failed to show efficacy but rather led tomore adverse events (fluid retention) versus placebo in patients with HFpEF-associated PH and HF with ejection fraction >35%-associated CpcPH, respectively. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors were assessed intwo small RCTs in patients with HFpEF and PH with distinct haemodynamic characteristics. In patientswith a predominantly IpcPH profile, sildenafil had no effect on mPAP (primary endpoint) or otherhaemodynamic and clinical measures versus placebo [685]. In patients with a predominantly CpcPH profile, sildenafil improved haemodynamics, RV function, and quality of life at 6 and 12 months versusTABLE 23 Patient phenotyping and likelihood for left heart disease as cause of pulmonary hypertension Feature PH-LHD unlikely Intermediate probabilityPH-LHD likely Age <60 years 60 -70 years >70 years Obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, glucose intolerance/diabetesNo factors 1 -2 factors >2 factors Presence of known LHD No Yes Yes Previous cardiac intervention No No Yes Atrial fibrillation No Paroxysmal Permanent/persistentStructural LHD No No PresentECG Normal signs of ratio ventricular hypertrophy; PH, hypertension; PH-LHD, left heart disease associated with pulmonary hypertension; RA, right atrium; RV, right ventricle; VE/VECO2, ventilatory equivalentsfor carbon dioxide.

HUMBERT ET AL.placebo [686]. Furthermore, retrospective analyses and registry data suggested improvements in exercise capacity with PDE5i therapy in patients with HFpEF-associated CpcPH and with 687]. 8.3.1.3. Interatrial shunt devices Recent data suggest that specific interventions may be considered in selected cases of HFpEF, such asinteratrial shunt devices to unload the left heart. While this was associated with short-term improvementsin pulmonary vascular function [688], the long-term effect on the pulmonary circulation remains unknown.The recent REDUCE LAP-HF II trial failed to show a reduction in HF events after placement of an atrialshunt device in a population of HF patients with LVEF 40% [689], with worse outcomes in the presence of PVD [690]. In addition, a sustained increase in PA blood flow may be a matter of concern, as this maytrigger vascular remodelling in patients with pre-existing PH. 8.3.1.4. Remote pulmonary arterial pressure monitoring in heart failure The importance of decongestion in patients with HF is underscored by the use of implantable pressuresensors, remotely monitoring PAP as a surrogate of left-sided filling pressure. Pulmonary arterialpressure-based adjustment of HF therapy substantially reduced HF hospitalizations and improved outcomesin both patients with HFpEF and HFrEF [691 -694], with adjustment of diuretic therapy being the most prominent therapeutic consequence. Further strategies to optimize management depending on thehaemodynamic phenotype in PH-LHD remain to be established. In HFrEF, novel medical therapies such asARNIs and SGLT-2is reduced remotely monitored PAP and diuretic use [695 -698], potentially providing opportunities to further optimize PAP-guided HF therapy. 8.3.2. Pulmonary hypertension associated with valvular heart disease Pulmonary hypertension frequently occurs as a consequence of valvular heart disease. While surgical orinterventional approaches for valvular repair improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamics by reducing PAWPand PAP and improving forward SV [699], persistent PH after correcting valvular heart disease is frequentand associated with adverse outcomes [634, 8.3.2.1. Mitral valve Both post-capillary mitral regurgitation occurs in both HFrEF and HFpEF, and is a n important contributor to PH in LHD. Reducing mitral regurgitation according to the reco mmendations of the 2021 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [28] has a crucial role in improving haemodynamics in patients with HFrEF, as thisreduces mPAP and PAWP and improves the CI [699]. Nevertheless, registry data have demonstrated that evenmoderately elevated sPAP negatively impacts post-procedural outcomes after or catheter-based aortic valve repair, pre-interventionalPH is associated with a higher risk of in-hospital adverse events and adverse long-term outcomes [646 -651]. Although post-procedural improvement in PH correlates with symptom relief and favourable outcomes,persistence of PH is common, and even moderate PH is associated with a higher all-cause mortality[646 -651]. Of note, medical therapy of PH post-valvular repair may be harmful. A randomized study of 231 patients with surgically corrected valvular heart disease and persistent PH showed that sildenafil therapy versus placebo was associated with worse outcome when compared with placebo [701]; however, this study didnot distinguish between different types of PH (pre-capillary, IpcPH, and CpcPH). 8.3.2.3. Tricuspid regurgitation Severe TR is associated with volume overload, increased RV workload, and maladaptive remodelling,leading to symptomatic right HF and impaired survival [702, 703]. While primary TR is relatively rare,functional TR may arise from annular dilation in the presence of both PH and LHD. Transcathetertricuspid valve interventions have recently emerged, aiming at reducing TR and RV volume overload. Ofnote, correcting TR in patients with PAH or PH in (non-valvular) LHD with significantly elevated PVRand/or RV dysfunction must be considered with great caution, as this may be hazardous [704]. Rightventricle -PA coupling is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in such patients [705]. Patient selection appears crucial, and a comprehensive diagnostic approach integrating imaging modalities andinvasive haemodynamic assessment is necessary in the evaluation process prior to tricuspid valve repair,particularly since echocardiography underestimates sPAP in the presence of severe TR. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 86EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.8.3.3. Recommendations on the use of drugs approved for PAH in PH-LHD The recommendations on the use of drugs approved for PAH in patients with PH-LHD have beenestablished based on key narrative question 5 (Supplementary Data, Section 8.3). The recommendations on the use of PDE5is in patients with CpcPH associated with HFpEF are based on PICO question II (Supplementary Data, Section 8.4). Two RCTs that enrolled patients with HFpEF and PHwere identified, but no study that specifically enrolled patients with HFpEF and CpcPH. Harmful effectscannot be excluded, even if the available data from clinical studies, case series, and registries suggest thatPDE5is may be safely administered to patients with HFpEF-associated CpcPH. As a result, a generalrecommendation for or against the use of PDE5is in patients with HFpEF and CpcPH cannot be made.However, it is clinically relevant to make a recommendation against their use for patients with HFpEF andIpcPH.

Pulmonary hypertension associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxia (group 3) Pulmonary hypertension is frequently observed in patients with COPD and/or emphysema, hypertension is uncommon in obstructive s leep apnoea unless other conditions coexist, such https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 87EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET COPD or daytime hypoventilation [709]. At high altitude (>2500 m) hypoxia-induced PH is t hought to affect >5% of the population, the development of PH being related to geography and genetic factors[710]. A PH screening study performed on a large cohort of >100 patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis confirmed that PH is usually mild in that setting: from six patients (5.7%) presenting with pre-capillaryPH, none had mPAP >30 mmHg and PH was associated with PFT alteration, suggesting that the rise inmPAP is associated with parenchymal involvement [711]. Thus, PH in lymphangioleiomyomatosis is nowclassified in group 3 PH [1]. In patients with lung disease, PH is categorized as non-severe or severe, depending on haemodynamic findings (Figure 12). In the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH, severe PHwas defined by mPAP >35 2[25, 26]. However, two recent studies have demonstrated that a PVR >5 WU is a better threshold for predicting worse prognosis in FIGURE 12 Pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease (group 3). COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CPFE, combined pulmonary vascular WU, Wood units. Shown areunderlying lung diseases (upper panel); contributing pathogenic pulmonary alterations of airways,parenchyma, and vessels (middle panel); and the relation of airway/parenchymal remodelling and vascularremodelling to the degree of PH and its consequences for exercise limitation (ventilatory versus circulatory, lower panel). https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 88EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.patients with PH associated with both COPD and ILD [712, 713]. Based on these data, the current guidelines used PVR to distinguish between non-severe PH (PVR 5 WU) and severe PH (PVR >5 WU). Whereas non-severe PH is common in advanced COPD and ILD defined by spirometric criteria, severe PHis uncommon, occurring in 1 -5% of cases of COPD and <10% of patients with advanced ILD, with limited data in obesity hypoventilation syndrome [714, 715]. Even non-severe PH in lung diseasenegatively impacts symptoms and survival, and is associated with increased hospitalization [715 -717]. Patients with lung disease and severe PH have a worse outcome than those with non-severe PH, providingevidence that this distinction has clinical significance [51, 712, 713, 718, 719]. It is noteworthy thatdeveloping severe PH is largely independent of spirometry but usually accompanied by hypoxaemia, lowPaCO 2, and a significant reduction in DLCO [51, 714, 718, 719]. Pulmonary hypertension presenting in patients with lung disease may be due to a number of causes, including undiagnosed CTEPH or PAH [714, 720]. Cardiac comorbidities are also common in patientswith lung disease and may contribute to PH. A number of distinct phenotypes of PH in patients with lungdisease, including a pulmonary vascular phenotype, have been proposed [51, 720]. The pulmonaryvascular characterized by better preserved spirometry, low DLCO, hypoxaemia, a range ofparenchymal involvement on lung imaging, and a circulatory limitation to exercise [51, 714, 718 -722]. Recent studies have shown that the clinical characteristics, disease trajectory, response to treatment [451, 718, 719], and histological correlates [723, 724] of patients with severe PH and minor lung disease aredifferent to those in patients with IPAH, including a poorer prognosis. 9.1. Diagnosis In patients with lung disease, symptoms of PH, especially exertional dyspnoea, overlap with those of theunderlying condition. Physical findings may also be non-specific, for example: ankle swelling is commonduring episodes of ventilatory failure in COPD, where activation of the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system may cause fluid retention, usually in the setting of preserved RV function. Non-invasive tests \u2014such as ECG showing right axis deviation or RV strain, elevated levels of BNP/ NT-proBNP, CPET, or features on cross-sectional imaging \u2014may suggest the diagnosis of PH in patients with lung disease [725, 726]. Echocardiography remains the most widely used non-invasive diagnostic toolfor assessing PH; however, the accuracy of echocardiography in patients with advanced respiratorydiseases is low, with a TRV unmeasurable in >50% of patients in some studies, and there is a tendency tooverestimate PAP and misclassify patients with PH [86, 87, 727]. More recent data suggest that a stepwise,composite, echocardiographic score can identify patients with severe PH, with and without an estimate ofTRV, using other echocardiographic features including RA area, RV:LV ratio, and LV eccentricityindex [728]. Where PH is suspected, combining echocardiography with a contrast-enhanced CT may aiddiagnostic assessment and disease classification [108, 729 -731]. Pulmonary artery enlargement, RV outflow hypertrophy, and increased RV:LV ratio may suggest a diagnosis of PH [108]. Ideally,assessments should be made or repeated when the patient is clinically stable, as exacerbations cansignificantly raise PAP. Key parts of evaluating suspected PH in lung disease include integrating: 1) the presence or absence of risk factors for PAH, CTEPH, or LHD; 2) clinical features, including disease trajectory ( e.g.rapid recent deterioration versus gradual change over years, and oxygen requirements); 3) PFTs, including DLCO and blood gas analysis; 4) NT-proBNP measurements, and and 5) cross-sectionalimaging with contrast-enhanced CT, SPECT, or scan and, selected cases, cMRI [732] toassess the need for RHC. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be helpful in assessing ventilatory orcardiac limitation in patients with lung disease [121, 733], although data are limited regarding its clinicaluse in identifying patients with PH in lung disease. Indications for RHC in lung disease include assessment for surgical treatments (selected patients considered for LTx and lung volume reduction surgery), suspected PAH or CTEPH, and where furtherinformation will aid phenotyping of disease and consideration of therapeutic interventions (Figure S3)[712, 718, 734]. Such testing should ideally be conducted in PH centres when patients are clinically stableand treatment of underlying lung disease has been optimized. Consideration should be given to howpressure measurements are made, due to the impact of changing intrathoracic pressures on pulmonaryhaemodynamics during the respiratory cycle (see Section 5.1.12) [735]. 9.2. Therapy The therapeutic approach to group 3 PH starts with optimizing the treatment of the underlying lungdisease, including supplementary oxygen and non-invasive ventilation, where indicated, as well as https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 89EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.enrolment into pulmonary rehabilitation programmes [736]. There is limited and conflicting evidence for the use of medication approved for PAH in patients with group 3 PH, and these drugs may have variableand sometimes detrimental effects on haemodynamics, exercise capacity, gas exchange, and outcomes inthis patient population [181, 737 -740]. 9.2.1. Pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema Studies using drugs approved for PAH in patients with PH associated with COPD or emphysema haveyielded conflicting results and are mostly limited by small sample size, short duration, and insufficient haemodynamic characterization of PH [739, 741, 742]. In a 16 week RCT of 28 patients with COPD and severe PH confirmed by RHC, sildenafil therapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in PVRand quality of life [743]. Registry data identified that 30% of patients with COPD and severe PH, predominantly treated with PDE5is, had improved WHO-FC, 6MWD, and PVR versus baseline, and those with a treatment response had improved transplant-free survival [51, 718]. However, in the absence oflarge randomized trials, the evidence is insufficient to support the general use of medication approved forPAH in patients with COPD and PH. Patients with COPD and suspected or confirmed severe PH shouldbe referred to PH centres for individual decision-making. 9.2.2. Pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease Numerous phase 2 and phase 3 studies have investigated the use of ERAs to treat ILD, all with negativeresults [740, 744, 745]. In addition, the PDE5i sildenafil has been investigated in phase 3 trials of patientswith ILD, also with negative results [746, 747]. Few data from RCTs are available for patients with PHassociated with ILD, and many of the studies performed for this indication [748, 749] suffered from thesame limitations as the aforementioned studies in PH associated with COPD. In addition, there wereseveral adverse safety signals: ambrisentan was associated with an increased risk of clinical worsening inpatients with ILD with and without PH [740, 750], while riociguat was associated with an increased risk ofclinical worsening events, including potential excess mortality, in patients with PH associated withidiopathic interstitial pneumonia [181]. In contrast, promising results have been obtained with the use of inhaled treprostinil. A phase 3 RCT (INCREASE) examined inhaled treprostinil at a target dose of 72 \u00b5g given four times daily in 326 patientswith PH associated with ILD [734, 751]. The PH diagnosis was confirmed by RHC within 1 year prior toenrolment. At week 16, the placebo-corrected 6MWD improved by 31 m with inhaled treprostinil. Therewere also improvements in NT-proBNP and clinical worsening events, the latter driven by a lowerproportion of patients whose 6MWD declined by >15% from baseline. Given the significant impact of even non-severe PH in patients with lung disease, eligible patients should be referred for LTx evaluation. In patients with ILD and PH, inhaled treprostinil may be considered basedon the findings from the INCREASE study, but further data are needed, especially on long-term outcomes.The routine use of other medication approved for PAH is not recommended in patients with ILD andnon-severe PH. For patients with severe PH and/or severe RV dysfunction, or where there is uncertaintyregarding the treatment of PH, referral to a PH centre is recommended for careful evaluation, to facilitateentry into RCTs, and consider PAH therapies on an individual basis (Figure S3). Registry data show thatsome patients with group 3 PH are being treated with PAH medication, predominantly PDE5is [718, 752, 753],but it is unclear if and to what extent these patients benefit from this treatment. 9.2.3. Recommendations on the use of drugs approved for PAH in PH associated with lung disease The recommendations on the use of drugs approved for PAH in patients with PH associated with COPDand ILD have been established based on key narrative questions 6 and 7 (Supplementary Data, Sections9.1 and 9.2, respectively). The recommendations on the use of PDE5is in patients with severe PH associated with ILD are based on PICO question III (Supplementary Data, Section 9.3). There are no direct data from RCTs on the safety,tolerability, and efficacy of PDE5is in patients with PH associated with ILD. The indirect data included inthe guidelines do not enable firm conclusions to be drawn. Given the lack of robust evidence, the TaskForce members felt unable to provide a recommendation for or against the use of PDE5is in patients withILD and severe PH, and recommend that these patients are referred to a PH centre for individualizeddecision-making. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 90EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M.

Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (group 4) All patients whose symptoms can be attributed to post-thrombo-embolic fibrotic obstructions within the PAare considered to have CTEPD with or without PH; CTEPH remains the preferred term for patients withPH, as defined in Section 3.1 (Table 5) [54]. Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary disease describessymptomatic patients with mismatched perfusion defects on V/Q scan and with signs of chronic,organized, and chronic totalocclusions (pouch lesions or tapered lesions), after at least 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation.Pulmonary hypertension in this setting is not only a consequence of PA obstruction by organized fibrotic clots but can also be related to the associated microvasculopathy. In those patients without PH at rest, breathlessness could be due to exercise PH (see definition in Section 3.1, Table 5) and/or increased deadspace ventilation [54]. Excluding ventilatory echocardiography is of upmost importancewhen making therapeutic decisions in patients with CTEPD without PH. 10.1. Diagnosis Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension is a common and important cause of PH, with a distinctmanagement strategy. Thus, the possibility of CTEPH s hould be carefully considered in all patients with PH https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 91EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.(Figure 13). In the context of acute PE, CTEPH should be considered: 1) if radiological signs (detailed in Section 5.1.7) suggest CTEPH on the CTPA performed to diagnose PE and/or if estimated sPAP is >60 mmHg[112] on echocardiogram; 2) when dyspnoea or functional limitations persist in the clinical course post-PE [754];and 3) in asymptomatic patients with risk factors for CTEPH or a high CTEPH prediction score [755]. Clinicalconditions such as permanent intravascular devices (pacemaker, long-term central lines, ventriculoatrial shunts), inflammatory essential thrombocythaemia, polycythaemia vera, splenectomy, antiphospholipid syndrome, high-dose thyroid hormone replacement, malignancy are risk factors for CTEPH [54, 103, 756]. Alternative causes of PA obstructions (also included in group 4 of the PH classification) \u2014including PA sarcomas, other malignant tumours ( e.g.renal carcinoma, uterine carcinoma, and germ-cell tumours of the FIGURE 13 Diagnostic strategy in chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension. CPET, cardiopulmonary exercise test; uptake; history of PE, including elevated sPAP on echocardiography and signs suggesting CTEPH on CTPA performed at the time of the acute PE (Section 5.1.7).bAlternative perfusion imaging techniques \u2014such as iodine DECT, and MRI perfusion \u2014are currently under evaluation.cTypical including P ETCO2, high VE/VCO 2,l 5.1.11).dComprehensive work-up after 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation or sooner in unstable or rapidly deteriorating patients. Ideally, CTPA, DSA, and RHC are performed in CTEPH centres, but they are sometimesperformed in PH centres, depending on the country and organization. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 92EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS and foreign-body embolism \u2014have to be considered in the differential diagnosis of CTEPD [757]. They can be explored by specific additional imaging such as 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (PET) scan, which can provide additional information when PA sarcoma is suspected [758]. Ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy [207] remains the most effective tool in excluding CTEPD. Alternative perfusion imaging techniques \u2014such as iodine subtraction mapping, DECT, and MRI perfusion \u2014have numerous theoretical advantages over V/Q but are more technically challenging and expensive, havelimited availability, and currently lack multicentre validation. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography with bi-planar reconstruction is broadly used for diagnosing CTEPD and assessing operability, but a negative CTPA, even if high quality, does notexclude CTEPD, as distal disease can be missed. Digital subtraction angiography is still used to assesstreatment options inconclusive. Se lective segmental angiography, cone-beam CT, and area detector more accurate visualizati on of subsegmental vasculature and are useful for procedural guidance for BPA. The benefits of the new technologies require validating in prospective trials before being recommended for routine clin ical use; a large, European, multicentre study is currently ongoing [759]. 10.2. Therapy The CTEPH treatment algorithm includes a multimodal approach of combinations of pulmonaryendarterectomy (PEA), BPA, and medical therapies to target the mixed anatomical lesions: proximal,distal, and microvasculopathy, respectively (Figures 14 and 15). General measures recommended for PAH also apply to CTEPH, including supervised exercise training, which is effective and safe in inoperable CTEPH patients [760], as well as early after PEA [761]. Lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended for patients with CTEPH, as recurrent pulmonary thrombo-embolism accompanied by insufficient clot resolution are key pathophysiological features of thisdisease. There are no RCTs in CTEPH with any of the approved anticoagulants; however, despite this lackof evidence, VKAs are recommended by experts, and are most widely used as background therapy forpatients with CTEPH. More recently, NOACs have more frequently been used as alternatives to VKAs,again, lacking evidence from RCTs. A retrospective case series from the UK and a multicentre prospectiveregistry (EXPERT) showed comparable bleeding rates for VKAs and NOACs in CTEPH, but recurrentvenous thrombo-embolism rates were in receiving NOACs [762, 763]. In patients withantiphospholipid syndrome are recommended [103, 764, 765].Screening for antiphospholipid syndrome should be performed at CTEPH diagnosis. In the absence of anyevidence in favour or against prolonged anticoagulation in patients with CTEPD without PH, long-termanticoagulant therapy is based on individual decision-making. It is recommended when the risk of PE recurrence is intermediate or high, thereby following the 2019 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism (Table 11) [103]. 10.2.1. Surgical treatment Surgical PEA is the treatment of choice for patients with accessible PA lesions [102]. As surgery maynormalize pulmonary haemodynamics (65% decrease in PVR) [766] and functional capacity, an expertmultidisciplinary team including an experienced PEA surgeon (on-site or closely collaborating) ismandatory for evaluating operability and deciding final treatment [102]. Operability is based on team experience, accessibility of PA lesions, correlation between severity of PH and degree of PA obstructions, and comorbidities [767]. The surgical technique is complex but wellstandardized with >30 years of experience. It consists of a complete bilateral endarterectomy of the PAsdown to segmental and subsegmental levels in phases of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (Figure 15)[767, 768]. In CTEPH centres, surgical outcomes are favourable, with peri-operative mortality rates <2.5%due to improved management of cardiac and pulmonary complications and well-established use of ECMO[768]. Post-operative PH is frequently observed ( 25%) [766], but long-term outcomes after PEA surgery are excellent regarding survival (averaging 90% at 3 years) and quality of life [769 -771], even in patients with distal PA obstructions [772]. On the other hand, patients with proximal operable disease decliningsurgery have a poor long-term outcome, with a 5 year survival of 53% compared with 83% in patientsundergoing PEA [773]. Therefore, PEA should be offered to all operable patients with a favourable risk:benefit ratio, ideally during a personal consultation between the patient and the PEA surgeon [102]. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 93EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.Selected symptomatic patients with CTEPD without PH can be successfully treated by PEA, with clinical and haemodynamic improvements at rest and exercise [135, 774]. Those patients would require carefuldiscussion to balance risk and benefit. 10.2.2. Medical therapy To manage the microvascular component of CTEPH (Figure 15), medical therapies have been usedoff-label based on uncontrolled studies and/or regional approvals. Meanwhile, three RCTs havesuccessfully been conducted. The first phase 3 RCT investigated the efficacy of riociguat in patients withinoperable CTEPH or those with persistent/recurrent PH after PEA [775]. Riociguat, after 16 weeks oftherapy, improved 6MWD and reduced PVR by 31% compared with placebo, and is approved for thisindication. Treprostinil s.c. was investigated in a phase 3 RCT, which showed improved 6MWD at week24 in patients with inoperable CTEPH or those with persistent/recurrent PH after PEA receiving a highdose compared with a low dose [776]; s.c. treprostinil is approved for this indication. In a phase 2 studyincluding only patients with inoperable CTEPH, macitentan 10 mg improved PVR and 6MWD versus placebo at 16 and 24 weeks, respectively [777]. A phase 3 RCT is ongoing to evaluate the safety andefficacy of macitentan 75 mg in inoperable or persistent/recurrent as their efficacy in inoperable CTEPH has not been proven by RCTs or registry data [769, 778, 779].

HUMBERT ET AL.However, oral combination therapy, including PDE5is and ERAs, is common practice in patients with CTEPH with severe haemodynamic compromise [780]. 10.2.3. Interventional treatment Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (Figure 15) has become an established treatment for selected patients withinoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent PH after PEA, improving haemodynamics (PVR decrease 49 - 66%), right heart function, and exercise capacity [781 -794]. Long-term outcomes are promising, but evidence is still scarce [795]. FIGURE 15 Overlap in treatments/multimodality approaches in chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension.

HUMBERT ET AL.A staged interventional procedure with a limited number of dilated PA segments per session is preferred [102, 788]. The number of sessions needed and haemodynamic results are dependent on experience [781].While BPA is effective, it is associated with serious complications, which may be fatal. Procedural andpost-interventional complications include vascular injury due to wire perforation, and lung injury withhaemoptysis and/or hypoxia [102, 781, 796, 797]. A s with all interventional procedures, a significant learning curve has been shown, with reducing complication rates over time [781]; therefore, thisprocedure should be performed in high-volume CTEPH centres. As the rates of interventionalcomplications can be reduced by medical pre-trea tment, patients with a PVR >4 WU should be treated before BPA (Figure 15) [798]. Selected symptomatic patients with CTEPD without PH and segmental/subsegmental lesions can successfully be treated by BPA, with clinical and haemodynamic improvements at rest and exercise [799]. Preliminary data on PADN point towards improved exercise capacity and pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with persistent PH after PEA [800]; further confirmation is being awaited. 10.2.4. Multimodal treatment Multimodal therapy including surgery, medication, and intervention is offered to selected patients withCTEPH (Figure 15) [102]. Using medical therapy in patients with high pre-operative PVR to improve pulmonary haemodynamics before PEA is common practice but still controversial, as it is felt to delay timely surgical referral andtherefore definitive treatment [801 -803]. A significant proportion of symptomatic patients may have persistent or recurrent PH following PEA, which may also benefit from medical and/or interventional therapies (Figure 15) [804 -806]. An mPAP 30 mmHg has been associated with initiation of medical therapies post-PEA, and an mPAP 38 mmHg and PVR 5 WU with worse long-term survival [806]. Some patients with CTEPH may have mixed anatomical lesions, with surgically accessible lesions in one lung and inoperable lesions in the other lung. Such patients might benefit from a combined approach withBPA (prior to or at the same time as surgery) and PEA to decrease the surgical risk and improve the finalresult [807]. The recommendations on BPA and medical therapy in patients with inoperable CTEPH have been established based on key narrative question 8 (Supplementary Data, Section 10.1). The recommendation on the use of medical therapy before interventional therapy in patients with CTEPH who are considered inoperable but candidates for BPA is based on PICO question IV (SupplementaryData, Section 10.2). The included evidence suggests that pre-treatment improves pulmonaryhaemodynamics and safety of the procedure. This is confirmed by the clinical experience of Task Forcemembers. However, due to the low certainty of the evidence, the recommendation is conditional. 10.2.5. Follow-up Regardless of the result of PEA/BPA, patients should be regularly followed-up, including invasiveassessment with RHC 3 -6 months after intervention, allowing for consideration of a multimodal treatment approach. After successful treatment, yearly non-invasive follow-up, including echocardiography and anevaluation of exercise capacity, is indicated because recurrent PH has been described (Figure 14) [806]. Risk assessment with either the ESC/ERS or REVEAL risk score developed for PAH has been validated in medically treated patients with CTEPH [300, 808, 809], but it is unknown if its use has any therapeuticimplication or affects outcome. There are no data or consensus on what is the therapeutic target after PEA/BPA or medical therapy in CTEPH. Most experts accept achieving a good functional class (WHO-FC I -II) and/or normalization or near normalization of haemodynamics at rest, obtained at RHC 3 -6 months post-procedure (PEA or last BPA), and improvement in quality of life. 10.3. Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension team and experience criteria To optimize patients 'outcomes, CTEPH centres should fulfil criteria for a PH centre (Section 12) and have a CTEPH multidisciplinary team consisting of a PEA surgeon, BPA interventionist, PH specialist, and https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 96EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.thoracic radiologist, trained in high-volume PEA and/or BPA centres. The team should meet regularly to review new referrals and post-treatment follow-up cases. Ideally, CTEPH figureshave been associated with better outcome. The CTEPH centres should also manage medically treatedpatients. Based on regional requirements, these numbers may be adjusted for the country 's population, ideally concentrating care and expertise in high-volume centres.

HUMBERT ET AL.11. Pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (group 5) Pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (Table 24) includes several conditions that may be complicated by complex and sometimes overlapping pulmonary vascular involvement. Although group 5 PH represents less-studied forms of PH, it constitutes a significant part ofthe worldwide burden of PH [1]. Group 5 PH includes: haematological disorders, such as myeloproliferative as sarcoidosis; metabolic diseases, such asglycogen storage disease; and others, such as chronic renal failure, pulmonary tumour thromboticmicroangiopathy, and fibrosing mediastinitis. A common feature of these diseases is that the mechanismsof PH are poorly understood and contributing factors may include, alone or in combination: hypoxicpulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary vasculitis, high-output cardiac failure, and leftHF. These patients need careful assessment and treatment should be directed to the underlying condition. 11.1. Haematological disorders In haemoglobinopathies and chronic haemolytic anaemias, including SCD, PH has emerged as a majorcause of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of PH confirmed by RHC was 6 -10% in studies of adult patients with stable SCD [93, 94, 813]. Patients with SCD with pre-capillary PH are more commonlyhomozygous for haemoglobin S, while some have S- 0 thalassaemia (S- 0 thal) or haemoglobin SCD [814]. Thrombotic lesions are a major component of PH related to SCD, more frequently in haemoglobinSCD [814]. Patients with PH and SCD should be followed by multidisciplinary SCD and PH teams, sincetreatment of the anaemia is a key part of management [814]. There is a lack of data to support the use ofPAH drugs in patients with SCD-associated PH. In a study in patients with SCD with TRV 2.7 m/s and a 6MWD of 150 -500 m, sildenafil showed no treatment effect on 6MWD, TRV, or NT-proBNP, but appeared to increase hospitalization rates for pain [815]. Preliminary evidence supports the short- andlong-term benefits of chronic blood-exchange transfusions in patients with pre-capillary PH complicatingSCD [816]. Pre-capillary PH complicating SCD has an important impact on survival, with an overall deathrate of 2.0 -5.3% in different populations with similar follow-up (26 months and 18 months, respectively) [94, 817]. In -thalassaemia, invasive haemodynamic evaluation confirmed pre-capillary PH in 2.1% of cases, while a post-capillary profile was found in 0.3% [818]. Potential treatment strategies are awaiting anenhanced understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms. In spherocytosis, splenectomy is a riskfactor for CTEPH [819]. Multiple causes of PH have been described in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders [820]. In chronic myelogenous leukaemia, spleen can rise to hyperkinetic syndrome.Hepatosplenic enlargement can also cause PoPH. Cases of potentially reversible DPAH have beenTABLE 24 Pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multi-factorial mechanisms Disorders associated with pulmonary hypertension 1) Haematological disorders Inherited and acquired chronic haemolytic anaemia histiocytosis Neurofibromatosis type 1 3) Metabolic disorders Glycogen storage disease Gaucher disease 4) ponatinib. In polycythaemia vera and thrombocythaemia, there is an increased risk of venous thrombo-embolic disease and CTEPH; moreover, a blood clot withinthe hepatic veins can lead to Budd -Chiari syndrome seconda ry myelofibrosis may also contribute to dyspnoea and PH. Group 5 PH may be described in other haematological disorders, such as common variable (POEMS) syndrome [821 -823]. 11.2. Systemic disorders The reported prevalence of PH in patients with sarcoidosis is 6 -20% [824]. The causes are multifactorial, including fibrosing lung disease, granulomata in the PAs and/or pulmonary veins, fibrosing mediastinitis and/or extrinsic compression by lymph and PoPH [58, 825]. It isassociated with significant morbidity and increased mortality compared with sarcoidosis without PH [58,825]. In a registry, factors independently associated with outcomes included physiological (forcedexpiratory volume in 1 s/FVC ratio and DLCO) and functional (6MWD) parameters [58]. In a large studyof severe, sarcoidosis-associated short-term pulmonary haemodynamics withoutimproving 6MWD [59]. Small RCTs have suggested efficacy of PAH drugs in these patients, whichrequires confirmation in larger studies [826]. Corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy may improvehaemodynamics in selected patients with active granulomatous disease. Of note, when pulmonary vascularcompression is suspected (fibrosing mediastinitis and/or extrinsic compression by lymph nodes), resultsfrom pulmonary angiography and PET scans provide additional information justifying endovascular and/oranti-inflammatory approaches. Long-term survival remains poor in sarcoidosis-associated PH, which makesLTx a reasonable option for selected severe cases. In pulmonary Langerhans 's cell histiocytosis, diminished exercise capacity does not appear to be due to ventilatory limitation but may be related to pulmonary vascular dysfunction. In 29 patients with PHassociated with pulmonary Langerhans 's cell histiocytosis, PAH drugs improved haemodynamics without worsening oxygen levels [827]. Pulmonary hypertension associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 is a rare but severe complication characterized by female predominance (female/male ratio 3.9:1) [828]. Specific pulmonary vascularinvolvement exists in these patients, and despite a potential short-term benefit of PAH drugs, prognosisremains poor, and LTx should be considered in selected patients with severe disease. In the presence ofdyspnoea, screening for ILD by non-contrast CT and for PH by echocardiography is required [828]. 11.3. Metabolic disorders Glycogen storage diseases are caused by genetic alterations of glycogen metabolism, and PH case reportshave been related to glycogen storage disease type 1 and 2 [829]. The occurrence of PH has predominantlybeen described in glycogen storage disease type 1, where it may partly be due to vasoconstrictive amines such as serotonin. Drugs for PAH have been used in some cases [830]. Untreated patients with Gaucher disease may develop PH, which is caused by a combination of factors, including asplenia, plugging of the vasculature by abnormal macrophages, and pulmonary vascularremodelling. Treatment with enzyme-replacement therapy may improve PH. 11.4. Chronic kidney failure Although commonly recognized in chronic renal failure, the pathogenesis of PH remains poorlyunderstood and PH is observed in patients prior to and while receiving different dialysis modalities [831].A recent RHC study of 3504 patients with chronic kidney disease found that CpcPH was the mostcommon phenotype, and the phenotype with the highest mortality [832]. Post-capillary PH has been described in 65% of patients receiving haemodialysis and 71% of patients in small PAs, pulmonary veins, and lymphatics. It is a rare cause of PH, whicharises due to multiple mechanisms, but probably remains under-diagnosed, as evidenced by autopsyfindings [834]. The disorder is associated with carcinomas, notably gastric carcinoma. Progressive vesselocclusion ultimately results in PH, which is often severe, of sudden onset, rapidly progressive, and https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 99EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET by progressive hypoxaemia. Chest CT may show Fibrosing mediastinitis is caused by fibrous mediastinum, encasing mediastinalviscera and compressing mediastinal bronchovascular structures [835]. post-capillary cancomplicate the course of fibrosing mediastinitis due to extrinsic compression of the PAs and/or pulmonaryveins. Fibrosing mediastinitis can be idiopathic or caused by irradiation, infection (tuberculosis,histoplasmosis), and systemic diseases, such as sarcoidosis and IgG4-related disease, a fibroinflammatorydisease characterized by elevated serum IgG4 levels with infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells and severe fibrosis in affected tissues [821]. Treatment should be directed to the underlying condition. No clear clinical improvement has been described with PAH drugs. Surgical and endovascular procedures have beenproposed to de-obstruct or bypass the arterial and/or venous compressions. In the absence of positive RCTs studying the use of PAH drugs for treating group 5 PH, treating the underlying disorder remains the standard of care [836]. Importantly, some of the diseases described inTable 24 may have a pulmonary venous component that could be made worse with PAH drugs, implyingthat off-label use of drugs approved for PAH should be considered with great caution, if at all.Placebo-controlled, randomized trials are currently recruiting in well-phenotyped subgroups of PH withunclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms, such as sarcoidosis-associated PH. 12. Definition of a pulmonary hypertension centre While PH is not an uncommon condition, severe forms of PH, especially PAH and CTEPH, require highlyspecialized management. Since medical centres with multidisciplinary teams and a high volume of patientsgenerally offer best standard of care, which translates into better clinical outcomes, establishing PH centresis clinically and economically highly desirable and is supported by patient organizations and scientificsocieties. The purpose of a PH centre is to: receive new referrals; assess and investigate the cause of PH;carefully phenotype and routinely manage patients with medical, interventional, and surgical approaches;work closely with other health care providers to achieve the best outcomes for patients; undertake audits(reporting patient case mix and quality indicators); and be involved in clinical and translational research,and education. The requirements \u2014comprising definition, multidisciplinary structure, number of cases, procedures, and staffing levels, as well as the skills and resources needed in a PH referral centre \u2014are described below and in Figure 16. Criteria for paediatric and CTEPH centres are described elsewhere(Sections 7.8.3 and 10.3, respectively). 12.1. Facilities and skills required for a pulmonary hypertension centre Pulmonary hypertension centres care for a sufficient number of patients on PH therapy, as well as newreferrals, to warrant this status. According to the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatmentof PH and the European Reference Network on rare respiratory diseases (ERN-LUNG) competencyrequirements, the ideal number of patients seen by an adult centre each year is no fewer than 200, of whichat least half have a final diagnosis of PAH; a PH centre follows at least 50 patients with PAH or CTEPHand receives at least two new referrals per month with documented PAH or CTEPH [25, 26, 837 -839]. These numbers can be adapted according to specific country characteristics (small population, largegeographical area) provided that strong working collaborations are established with high-volume centres.This is currently facilitated by the availability of secure virtual platforms ( e.g. ERN clinical patient management system) [840]. Proper training of staff members includes core competencies, such as those outlined in the ERS Pulmonary Vascular Diseases Continuing Professional Development framework [841], and builds on entrustableprofessional activities, described in the ESC Core Curriculum [842]. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging facilities include: a ward where health care providers have expertise in PH; a specialist outpatient service; an intermediate/ICU; 24/7 emergency care; an interventional radiologyunit; diagnostic investigations, including echocardiography, CT scanning, nuclear medicine, MRI, exercisetests, and PFTs; a cardiac catheterization laboratory; access to genetic counselling and testing; and fast andeasy access to cardiothoracic and vascular surgery. Key diagnostic procedures are performed in sufficientnumbers to guarantee expertise ( e.g.ERN-LUNG requirements) [837]. In analogy with the 'advanced heart failure units '[843], PH centres offer the full range of PAH therapies available in their country (including i. v./s.c. prostacyclin derivatives) and have early referral protocols to CTEPH, LTx, and rehabilitation centres.Since evaluation and early availability of new drugs and techniques are critical, PH centres participate incollaborative clinical research. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 100EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.Regular multidisciplinary team meetings, including core members and on-demand invited members (extended multidisciplinary team) as needed (Figure 16), are required to establish and adapt individual patient care pathways. Case management (co-ordination of individual patient pathways) should include FIGURE 16 Pulmonary hypertension centre schematic. CHD, congenital heart pulmonary hypertension.aNumber adapted according to specific country characteristics.bCase manager can be a nurse specialist, social worker, physiotherapist, or administrative assistant in function of the centre organization.cCan be located in partner centres.

Remote accessibility of the PH centre by phone, mail, or other is a vital part of the care. Strategies have to be implemented in order to improve health literacy and shareddecision-making, with the support of dedicated patient decision tools. Transitioning from a paediatric PHcentre to an adult PH centre requires adequate planning to prevent gaps in care. Involving national and/orinternational patient associations helps to design patient-centric care and to spread medical knowledgeamong patients and their carers. Pulmonary hypertension centres should record patients 'data using local, national, or international patient registries, and be able to report process indicators (compliance with diagnostic and treatment guidelines,including LTx) and outcome indicators, such as WHO-FC, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, quality oflife, complications, and survival. They should undergo regular audits to assess the quality of delivered care.

European Reference Network In 2017, the European Commission launched European Reference Networks (ERNs) for rare diseases thatincluded the ERN-LUNG with a PH core network. European Reference Networks are patient-centrednetworks of commissioned centres offering guidance and cross-border best standard of care in the European Union. The PH network includes over 20 full members, contributing each year 1500 new patients with PAH or CTEPH [844]. It also includes UK supporting centres, and affiliated partners (whodo not necessarily have to fulfil the minimum competency criteria of the ERN-LUNG PH network). TheERN-LUNG requires and monitors standards for these centres. 12.3. Patient associations and patient empowerment Pulmonary hypertension centres should inform patients about patient associations and encourage them tojoin such groups. Patient associations are a valuable resource for managing patients, as they provideeducational and emotional support, and can have positive effects on coping, confidence, and outlook [845].It is recommended that PH centres collaborate with patient associations on initiatives to empower patientsand improve the patient experience, addressing issues such as health literacy, digital skills, healthylifestyles, mental health, and self-management. Health care can be delivered more effectively andefficiently if patients are full partners in the process. 13. Key messages 1) The haemodynamic definition of PH has been updated as mPAP >20 mmHg. The definition of PAH also implies a PVR >2 WU and PAWP 15 mmHg. These cut-off values better reflect the limits of normal ranges, but do not yet translate into new therapeutic recommendations, since the efficacy ofPAH therapy in patients with PVD and an mPAP 21 -24 mmHg and/or PVR 2 -3 WU is still unknown. 2) The main diagnostic algorithm for PH has been simplified following a three-step approach, from suspicion by first-line physicians, detection by echocardiography, and confirmation with RHC in PHcentres. Warning signs associated with worse outcomes have been identified, which justify immediatereferral and management in PH centres. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 102EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.3) Screening strategies for PAH in patients with SSc and in those at risk of HPAH are proposed based on the results of published cohort studies. Their implementation may shorten the time from symptomonset to diagnosis of PAH. 4) An improved recognition of CT and echocardiographic signs of CTEPH at the time of an acute PE event, together with a systematic follow-up of patients with acute PE, as indicated in the 2019 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism, should help toremediate the underdiagnosis of CTEPH. 5) The three-strata risk-stratification assessment in PAH has been refined after being validated in multiple registries. The MRI and echocardiographic criteria have been added to the ESC/ERS table, refiningnon-invasive evaluation at diagnosis. 6) A four-strata risk stratification, dividing the large, intermediate-risk group into intermediate -low and intermediate -high risk, is proposed at follow-up. 7) The treatment algorithm for PAH has been simplified, with a clear focus on risk assessment, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, and treatment goals. Initial combination therapy and treatmentescalation at follow-up when appropriate are current standards. 8) The Task Force has attempted to close the gap between paediatric and adult PAH care, with therapeutic and follow-up strategies based on risk stratification and treatment response, extrapolated from that in adults but adapted for age. 9) The recommendations on sex-related issues in patients with PAH, including pregnancy, have been updated, with information and shared decision-making as key points. 10) The recommendations for rehabilitation and exercise programmes in PH have been updated following the release of additional supportive evidence. 11) For the first time, there is a recommendation for PH medical therapy in group 3 PH, based on a single positive RCT in patients with ILD. 12) The concept of CTEPD with or without PH has been introduced, enabling further research on the natural history and management in the absence of PH. 13) The treatment algorithm for CTEPH has been modified, including multimodal therapy with surgery, PH drugs, and BPA. 14. Gaps in evidence 14.1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1) \u0081The efficacy and safety of PAH drugs in group 1 patients with an mPAP 21 -24 mmHg, PVR 2 -3 WU, and exercise PH has to be established. \u0081The role of PAH drugs in different PAH subgroups, including schistosomiasis-associated PAH, needs to be explored. \u0081Risk-stratification assessment in PAH needs to be further prospectively validated through goal-orientated outcome studies, and optimized for patients with PAH and comorbidities. \u0081New PAH phenotypes observed in patients with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities are common and should be the focus of more research. \u0081The importance of PAH patient phenotypes and the relevance of comorbidities on treatment goals and outcomes must be further evaluated. \u0081The impact of PAH therapies and treatment strategies on survival needs to be further assessed. \u0081Pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs targeting novel pathways are emerging and the impact of add-on use of this medication on outcomes has to be evaluated in RCTs. \u0081The role of RV imaging techniques (echocardiography, cMRI) in diagnosing and stratifying risk in PAH needs to be further studied. The proposed cut-off values for risk stratification need to be properlyvalidated in multicentre studies. \u0081The role of CPET in the early diagnosis of PAH in populations at risk of developing PAH, and in assessing prognosis in PAH on top of clinical and haemodynamic data, needs further investigation. \u0081The role of exercise echocardiography and exercise RHC in patients at risk of developing PAH, with abnormal CPET but normal rest echocardiogram, also needs further evaluation. \u0081The use of mechanical circulatory support, particularly in reversible PH or in patients with advanced right HF with an exit strategy (such as LTx), has to be further studied. \u0081Differences in natural history and treatment response between adults and children should be further investigated. \u0081Further studies are needed on the effects of PADN in PAH and in other PH groups. \u0081The impact of centre volume, organization, and expertise on treatment outcome needs further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 103EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.14.2. Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease (group 2) \u0081The management of patients with group 2 PH needs further study with RCTs. \u0081Additional research is needed to facilitate non-invasive diagnosis of HFpEF-associated PH and distinguishing it from PAH. \u0081The role of fluid challenge and exercise testing to reveal left HF needs further validation. \u0081Further studies focusing on PDE5is in patients with HFpEF and a CpcPH phenotype are needed and currently underway. \u0081The effects that new HF medication (ARNIs, SGLT-2is) has on PH, through reverse remodelling of the LV, need further investigation. 14.3. Pulmonary hypertension associated with lung diseases and/or hypoxia (group 3) \u0081The management of patients with group 3 PH has to be further studied in RCTs. \u0081Refining phenotypes will be crucial, as this will inform development of trials. \u0081Clinical relevance and therapeutic implications of severe PH in lung disease need to be investigated. \u0081Long-term data on the effects of inhaled treprostinil (and other PAH drugs) in patients with PH associated with lung disease are needed. \u0081The impact of the hypobaric and hypoxic environment of the >150 million people living at >2500 m altitude has to be clarified, and studies need to be performed to assess potential treatment st rategies for PH. 14.4. Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (group 4) \u0081The differentiation between acute and chronic PE in imaging (CTPA) has to be improved. \u0081In patients with suspected CTEPH, the diagnostic role of DECT or iodine subtraction mapping versus V/Q lung scintigraphy has to be validated. \u0081The effect of drug therapy on the outcome of patients with CTEPH needs to be established. \u0081The treatment goals in patients with CTEPH have to be clarified, as it is still unclear if normalizing mPAP and PVR translates into improved outcomes. \u0081The role of BPA versus PEA should be further clarified: which treatment in which patient? Are they equivalent for the treatment of segmental/subsegmental disease? \u0081In inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent PH after PEA, the potential role of combination therapy of PH drugs must be assessed. \u0081The role of medical treatments as bridges to interventional and operative treatments needs to be formally tested. \u0081Randomized controlled trials are needed to discriminate the effects of PEA and early follow-up rehabilitation. \u0081The effect of PEA, BPA, and medical therapy on patients with CTEPD without PH is not established. 14.5. Pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (group 5) \u0081Further research needs to inform management of group 5 PH, such as SCD-associated PH and sarcoidosis-associated PH. 15.

HUMBERT ET AL.16. Quality indicators Quality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care quality, including structural, process, and outcomes of care [847]. They may also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to guideline recommendations through associated quality-improvement initiatives and benchmarking ofcare providers [848, 849]. As such, the role of QIs in improving care and outcomes for cardiovasculardisease is increasingly being recognized by health care authorities, professional organizations, p ayers, and the public [847]. The ESC understands the need for measuring and reporting quality and outcomes of cardiovascular care, and has established methods for developing the ESC QIs for the quantification of care and outcomes forcardiovascular diseases [847]. To date, the ESC has developed QI suites for a number of cardiovasculardiseases [850 -852] and embedded these in respective ESC Clinical Practice guidelines [27, 477, 853, 854]. Furthermore, the ESC aims to integrate its QIs with clinical registries such as the EurObservationalBOX 4 Continued Recommendations ClassaLevelb BPA is recommended in patients who are technically inoperable or have residual PH after PEA and distal obstructions amenable to BPAIB Riociguat is recommended for symptomatic patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/ recurrent PH after PEAIB Long-term follow-up is recommended after PEA and BPA, as well as for patients with CTEPH established on medical therapyIC Recommendations for pulmonary hypertension centres It is recommended that PH centres provide care by a multidisciplinary team (cardiologist, pneumologist, rheumatologist, nurse specialist, radiologist, psychological and social work support, appropriate on-call expertise)IC It is recommended that PH centres have direct links and quick referral patterns to other services (such as genetic counselling, PEA/BPA, LTx, adult congenital heart disease service)IC It is recommended that PH centres maintain a patient registry I C It is recommended that PH centres collaborate with patient associations I C 6MWD, 6-minute failure; function tests; PH, pulmonary hypertension; PH-LHD, pulmonary with Organization Wood units. aClass of recommendation.bLevel of evidence.cTesting should also be performed in patients with a baseline mPAP 40 mmHg, in whom the same responder criteria apply.dMeasured on at least two occasions. eCardiopulmonary comorbidities are predominantly encountered in elderly patients and include risk factors for HFpEF such as obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease, a history of hypertension, and/or a low DLCO.fERA used in the GRIPHON study were bosentan and ambrisentan.gThe PATENT plus study investigated the combination of sildenafil and riociguat; however, combining riociguat with any PDE5i is contraindicated.hSafety concerns have been identified when ERAs are used in patients with HF (HFpEF and HFrEF, with or without PH) and when sildenafil is used in patients with persistent PH after correction of valvular heart disease. iAssessments should ideally be made when the patient is clinically stable, as exacerbations can significantly raise pulmonary artery pressure.jThis recommendation does not apply to patients with end-stage lung disease who are not considered candidates for LTx.kThis does not include inhaled treprostinil, which may be considered in patients with PH associated with ILD irrespective of PH severity. https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00879-2022 109EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL ESC/ERS GUIDELINES | M. HUMBERT ET AL.Research Programme and the European Unified Registries On Heart Care Evaluation and Randomized Trials (EuroHeart) project [855] to provide real-world data about the patterns and outcomes of care for cardiovascular disease across Europe. In parallel with the writing of this Clinical Practice Guideline, a process has been initiated to develop QIs for patients with PH using the ESC methodology and through collaboration with domain experts and theHeart Failure Association of the ESC. Such QIs may be used for evaluating the quality of care for patientswith PH, and enable important aspects of care delivery to be captured. These QIs, alongside theirspecifications and development process, will be published separately. 17.
