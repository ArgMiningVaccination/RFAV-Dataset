DSP Roles, Self -Care and Boundaries Game Orientation Read each scenario and decide if it is an acceptable professional boundary or not NO YES You should give your phone number to people you support so they can contact you when you're not on shift. Posting pictures of the people you work with on your Facebook page is a great way to help them meet new friends. Your lunch was forgotten at home today and you're hungry. You know the person you support has a personal stash of cashews. If you just take a handful no one will notice. You're out hiking with someone you support when the weather shifts and it begins to rain. You have an extra jacket but the company has a \"no loaning or borrowing\" policy. Should you lend her the jacket? While out running errands, the person you support decides to stop for coffee. Since you are a little short on cash you borrow some of their spending cash to pay for your coffee, too. This allows you both to sit down for a nice break. Growing up in England you have never celebrated the Thanksgiving holiday. There are only two people living in the home where you work so it seems foolish to buy them a whole turkey to celebrate a single day. You decide to buy lunchmeat and make turkey and cranberry s andwiches. The game is tied and there are only 10 minutes left on the clock. Your scheduled shift is over and you're off the clock so you sit down with the guys you support to watch the end of the game . You've taken the core curriculum class and have been delegated to assist the two people you support. An eardrops prescription was just delivered to address one person's ear infection. The prescription states to begin as soon as possible. You've left a message with the nurse and are waiting for hi m to call you. Two hours have passed. Should you go ahead and put the drops in her ear? How might some behaviors be acceptable in your friend's home but not in the home of someone you support?

Chapter 1 Roles, Self -Care & Boundaries Cultural Competency Each of us has a \"cultural perspective\" that is made up of our beliefs, values, ethnicity, geography, religious beliefs, social experiences, education level, traditions and customs, communication, and behaviors. Cultural Competency describes our knowledge, value, appreciation, and respect for the different cul tural perspectives of those we interact with, such as the individuals we support, their family and friends, other stakeholders, our supervisors, and our peers. In order to communicate more effectively and best meet the needs of others, we must identify, u nderstand and respect how someone else's cultural perspective might differ from our own. Because differences can be reflected in both verbal and non - verbal communication, it's extremely important to set aside our preconceptions and become knowledgeable about the cultural perspective of the people we work with and support. Most importantly, it's crucial that we extend acceptance, appreciation, and respect to all we encounter. Ethics and Professionalism Although you will be working in a residential environment, what is acceptable in your own home or the home of a friend is not always acceptable in the homes of the individuals you'll be supporting. It will be important for you to always act as professionally as you would if you were working in an offi ce environment. At the same time, you must be keenly aware that you are in another person's home and respect their prerogative while being mindful of your own limitations. The list below includes examples of what professional behavior requires. Arriving on time for your shift Being calm and level -headed rather than reactive and emotional Being objective and not taking things personally Being a contributing, supportive team member Avoiding power struggles Communicating respectfully and listening carefully Not using profanity or unprofessional language Being empathetic and non- judgmental Caring about your job and giving your very best each day Being mindful of how your choices and behaviors impact others Abstaining from all gossip Owning up to and correcting your mistakes Not using your cell phone and personal electronics while on shift Dressing appropriately and professionally Choosing a positive attitude throughout your day Separating your personal life from your professional life Professional Boundaries Professional boundaries are essential to providing excellent support, maintaining healthy relationships, and protecting your own well -being. Here are some of the dangers of not maintaining professional boundaries: 1. Appearance of Favoritism : If an individual receiving services believes that he/she is favored by a particular staff member, it can easily lead to hurt feelings and resentment between the the individual and others that live in the home. It can also introduce resentment towards ot her staff members, making it difficult for them to provide them with excellent support. To avoid the appearance of favoritism, be certain to follow these rules: Share successful communication and support practices with others on your team, and be observant and open to learning successful practices from them. Doing so will allow them to receive the highest level of support 24 hours a day, and not only during certain days or shifts. In homes where there are multiple individuals receiving services, do not giv e more positive attention to some person s than others. 2. Confused Roles and Relationships : Significant emotional attachments, whether realized or perceived, can lead to a great deal of pain for both DSPs and the individuals they support. Sometimes, when a DS P allows a more significant emotional attachment than is healthy, both the DSP and the individual they support can experience significant loss and go through a full grieving process when the DSP leaves or is transferred to work with someone else. Likewise, an individual were to misinterpret \"signals\" from a DSP that caused them to believe that their relationship with a DSP was more personal than professional, there could be serious long -term pain and anger when the DSP leaves, or when they realize that thei r feelings are not returned. To avoid the appearance of a personal, rather than a professional relationship, be certain to follow these rules: Do not pursue a personal relationship outside of work. This includes both extending or accepting an invitation. Do not lend or give money, clothing, or other items to the individuals you support. Do not give gifts unless they come from your entire team or company Be aware of appropriate physical contact with individuals you support based on the individual's personal preferences and support needs. Physical contact that is appropriate for most individuals includes handshakes, high- fives, and brief pats on the shoulder. Do not give your cell phone number, email address, or home address to the individual you support. As well, do not \"friend\" them on Facebook or other social networking sites. Do not share details about your personal life. Do not stay longer than your shift requires or is required when transferring information from one shift to another. Do not do favors for individuals during your personal time or that are not a part of your job. Do not wear provocative or revealing clothing. 3. Transferring Negative Emotions : Moods and attitudes can be very contagious. This is great for positive moods and attitudes, but can have painful consequences for everyone when negativity and turmoil are absorbed. To avoid this, be certain to follow these rules: Do not discuss problems with peers or supervisors in front of or within earshot of anyone. Do not engage in power struggles w ith individuals receiving services or fellow employees. Avoid all sarcasm, caustic remarks, negative body language, and tone of voice. Do not share your personal problems with the individuals you support. Be \"present\" when on shift, and leave your persona l life at home. SKILLS ACQUISITION : COMMON CARE PRACTICES 1. Encourage the person to be as independent as they can be: Ask what assistance they need Ask what they can do for themselves Ask for their preferences Offer choices Ask how they want something done. Wait for them to ask for help Be patient Remember you are new. You will be anxious to be helpful and to \"fix\" things. You will think, \"I can do this faster, I'll just help out and get it done so we can move on to something else.\" The problem is th at with independence it also means having the right to fail, to struggle, to take longer than you do, to complete it so that pride and value are also part of the task. 2. Respect person's right to: Say no or refuse To make a mistake To struggle with the ta sk To take longer Choose when, how and where they receive support/care Feel and be safe during support/care Know what is observed about them and how it is reported; and Have clean linens, clothing, implements, assistive devices, etc. Voice complaints (swearing and cursing) Have and express personal beliefs The hard part about respecting someone else's right to make a mistake or to struggle is that it's just plain hard to watch. We are tempted to \"rescue\". 3. Keep the person safe at all times: Position a safe distance from the edge of the bed or chair Keep them warm Encourage them to keep their area clear so they can move easily Roll them towards you instead of away from you Provide privacy Use a gentle touch s o you don't hurt or scrape their skin Do NOT u se verbal or physical abuse. Tailor interaction Provide appropriate support (water temp, sunscreen) Monitor Preventing bad things from happening is different from just keeping people safe. In your life time, have you done anything that wasn't safe when you first started it? Riding a bicycle, skateboard, motorcycle.... But if you hadn't continued to pursue the activity you would never have built the skills needed to achieve the task. When we talk about a person feeling safe, what does that mean? (respec t, trust...) 4. Use infection control processes to keep the person healthy and minimize germs: Wash your hands when you enter and exit their room and as you gather supplies for a task before touching the person Disinfect non -disposable items after use Wear g loves whenever you might come in contact with bodily fluids Use other personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as needed (more on this in chapter 12) Keep the environment as clean as possible Define expectations of clean for person and agency Ask - Do you see/s mell what I see/smell? Bathing did not become popular until Marco Polo visited China to find that bathing was part of their daily habit. They thought he smelled bad and taught him this skill. Not bathing has a huge impact on infection control and we exp ect people will smell good and be clean as part of our cultural values. Doctors learned to wash their hands in the mid 1800's which stopped the spread of infectious diseases and contaminating surgical sites. Wiping off door knobs and other controls on a regular basis can stop the spread of cold and flu germs and keep people healthier. IF you don't do these things at home, you may be learning some new prevention skills that you can apply there as well. In Japan and other parts of the world, when a person has a cold, they wear a mask to help prevent the spread of germs. Be purposeful and intentional. Make it part of your daily routine to prevent the spread of germs. 5. Talk to the person and use active listening skills: Tell them what actions you are going to do before you do it Listen to their words and tone Observe body language and facial expressions Ask for feedback Give them your undivided attention Use age appropriate language Reflective Listening Talk to them as adults @ eye level Communication in your work will be difficult until you learn the language. People with Developmental Disabilities, learning disabilities, mental health issues - may have difficulty communicating with you initially and you will have difficulty understanding what they n eed or want. Do not give up! Ask for help! \"What did that mean?\" \"I don't understand what you need me to do.\" Making sure the person you support knows that you are trying will go a long way to build trust and a positive relationship. 6. Support the whole person: Problem solve with them not for them Give them choices Ask their preferences Know what triggers certain behaviors or responses and what you can do to promote their emotional or physical success Be proactive and anticipate their needs Talk to them as an equal to yourself Do not embarrass or demean them by: Gawking, staring at them or something on them Using inappropriate words Wrinkling your nose because they smell Grunting when you move them Adjusting clothing, un derwear, bras in public places We may think it's funny or we may do display things that we are not aware of. Do you wrinkle your nose when you smell something bad or make loud comments \"That smells so bad you could knock a buzzard off a manure wagon!\" Funny right? Not in this setting. It's embarrassing and disrespectful. It will not help you to build a trusting relationship with the person you support. Always ask yourself - Will my actions help or hurt my relationship with this person? Take a pause if you are about to do something that Jiminy Cricket wouldn't approve of! (the cricket from Walt Disney that tells you to listen to your conscience.) Common Care practices self -assessment Place a 1,2, 3, or 4 in the box 1 = I never heard of this 2 = I t hink I could improve on this 3 = of course I do this but I want to do it more 4 = I do this with intention. I can still improve but I'm pretty good now. Today - how well you think you might do First time after working with people One month from today One year from today 1. Encourage the person to be as independent as they can be : Ask what assistance they need Ask what they can do for themselves Ask for their preferences Offer choices Ask how they want something done Wait for them to ask for help Be patient 2. Respect person's right to: Say no or refuse To make a mistake To struggle with the task To take longer Choose when, how and where they receive support/ care Feel and be safe during support/care Know what is observed about them and how it is reported Have clean linens, clothing, implements, assistive devices, etc . 3. Keep the person safe at all times Position a safe distance from the edge of the bed or chair Keep them warm Encourage them to keep their walking area clear so they can move easily Roll them towards you instead of away from you Provide privacy Use a gentle touch to you don't hurt or scrape their skin Do NOT use verbal or physical abuse 4. Use infection control processes to keep the person healthy and minimize germs Wash your hands when you enter and exit their room and as you gather supplies for a task before touching the person Disinfect non -disposable items after use Wear gloves whenever you might come in contact with bodily fluids Use other personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as needed Keep the environment as clean as possible 5. Talk to the person and use active and reflective listening skills Tell them what actions you are going to do before you do it Listen to their words and tone Observe body language and facial expressions Ask for feedback Give them your undivided attention Use age appropriate language 6. Support the whole person Problem solve with them not for them Give them choices Ask their preferences Know what triggers certain behaviors or responses and what you can do to promote their emotional or physical success Be proactive and anticipate their needs Talk to them as an equal to yourself Do not embarrass or demean them by: Gawking, staring at them or something on them Using inappropriate words Wrinkling your nose because they smell Grunting when you move them Adjusting pants, underwear, bras in public places Totals: DSP Self -Care Because of the emotional and physical investment that is sometimes required, be certain to take the following advice: 1. Just as you should leave your personal life at home when working, leave your work -cares at work when home. 2. Take care of your body - get plenty of sleep, eat well, exercise and limit your alcohol intake. 3. When facing challenges at work, practice \"rational detachment.\" To remain objective , remember that taking comments, events or situations personally will only create pain for yourself and prevent you from properly addressing or solving problems. 4. Do not \"own\" the problems or negativity of others. Assist as needed, but don't absorb their ne gative emotions. 5. Start well; end well. Make it a habit to begin and end each day with uplifting conversations with others. The pattern of doing so will eventually become second nature and extend to other parts of your day. 6. Every once in a while, take a few days to get away. Being away from your normal environments is refreshing and provides greater perspective. 7. Be learning and growing. Learn something new, expand your knowledge and develop your existing talents. People who are active learners tend to experience happiness at higher levels than those who don't. Direct Support Professional Roles All of the roles that you play have a common focus on supporting individuals to live the life they desire. You are a teacher, partner, resource, ambassador, advoc ate, encourager and provider . You are not a boss, or one who orders people around and makes them do things they may or may not want to do. Likewise, you are not a parent to the people you support. Your job carries a great deal of responsibility, and it is easy to get these roles confused. Unlike a parent, legal guardian, or conservator, you do not have the responsibility to make important life decisions for the individuals you work for and with (such as medical or financial decisions). Instead, the individu als themselves, with the assistance of parents, legal guardians, or conservators, as appropriate, make decisions about their own lives. This is called Person Centered Thinking. Person Centered Thinking guides your every decision as you support people to l ive the life they choose. Think of yourself every time you want to make a decision for this person. Do you have your own daily routines? Do you own collections? Do you have certain foods that you like to eat? Are there places that you like to go? If you can answer yes to any of these questions, then you must ask the person you are supporting for their choices. Your job is to support this person in their choices. Bending them to you choices because it makes it easier on you is not the point of this j ob. Be person centered and you will do a great job! Direct Support Professional Attire What you wear and how you take care of yourself have an impact on the individuals you support as well as the agency you represent. Some individuals will look to you as a model of how to dress. The community you engage with will see your attire and personal hygiene as a direct reflection of the care you and the agency you work for provide to the individuals you suppor t. Here are a few things to remember: You should dre ss in a manner that can safely and comfortably support a variety of home living activities. Your attire should not call attention to you or set you apart from the person you are supporting. Dress modestly - do not dress provocatively. Refer to your agency' s dress policy for specific guidelines . Nurse Delegation Washington has a statewide process where Registered Nurses can delegate certain procedures to a DSP who has fulfilled specific requirements including: Completing and passing the Nurse Delegation Core Training Curriculum, attaining a Nursing Assistant Registered (NAR) license through the Department of Health and keeping it current annually, and being trained specifically on tasks for an individual by a delegating Registered Nurse. The DSP with the NAR will receive non -transferable delegated training for each individual he or she is tasked with providing specific services to such as applying a cream, instilling an eye drop, giving insulin injections, inserting a suppository. The RN is responsible for providing 90 day follow up and rev iew for the DSP to ensure he or she is only doing tasks delegated, and to ensure the DSP is aware of the medications being delegated. Grief and Loss Because of the nature of the work, DSPs and other long term care workers will experience grief and loss. While it can be experienced as a result of the passing of a person , it can also be experienced from other circumstances such as the transfer of a perso n or a DSP, an individual moving to another city, a job loss or even compassion fatigue. As is true with all forms of grief, how it is experienced and how it is processed will look quite different from person to person. Some of the symptoms of grief and lo ss that a DSP may experience could include: Sadness with or without crying Inability to concentrate Guilt feelings Sleeplessness Fatigue Lethargy Mood swings Withdrawing from social activities Appetite changes Anxiety If you believe you are experiencing grief, in addition to the resources mentioned earlier in the chapter here are a few ideas to consider when attempting to cope with a loss: 1. Give your grief attention; don't try to avoid it. Blocking the pain of grief emotionally, or trying to dull it with distractions and/or alcohol will only prolong your ability to heal and move forward. 2. Don't hold back tears, but don't be concerned if there are no tears. Some people cry more easily and often than others. There is no right or wrong way and it is not a measure for the pain of loss. 3. Don't obsess over the individual, but neither should you block them out of your mind. Remember good times and share stories about the person with others who knew the individual or who would understand. 4. Don't give your grief a time limit. It is entirely different with every individual and cannot be predicted. 5. Grief is not a steady process that starts off strong and gradually diminishes. It is much more of a roller coaster than a steady process or series of stages. 6. Most importantly, talk about your grief and draw close to others. Do not suffer through it alone; it won't work. Take advantage of family and friends, join a grief support group or talk to a therapist. No matter what, healing will require processing with the he lp of others; whether help is professional or personal. Overview of Developmental Disabilities As a result of participating in this segment of training, you will be able to: 1. Recall the historical treatment of people who have disabilities 2. Recognize criteria of the definition of developmental disabilities 3. Differentiate characteristics of specific developmental disabilities 4. Justify the \"Principal of Normalization\" 5.

Overview of Developmental Disabilities Chapter 2 Overview of Developmental Disabilities History of Developmental Disabilities Throughout the history of mankind, cultural perspectives regarding individuals with developmental disabilities have caused them to be abandoned, cast out, abused, victimized and even killed. Whether this mistreatment was due to fear, hate or beliefs about spiritual, evolutionary or physical inferiority, society has always fought embracing them as equals and including them in the daily norms of life. Recent history demonstrates the cultural reluctance that occurs even when in good faith, attempts are made to improve the acceptance and future of individuals with developmental disabilities. In the 1800's, a movement began where training schools were created to house the developmentally disabled and train them to be able to participate and function well within their communities. As their popularity grew, families were encouraged by doctors and other trusted advisors to place their children in these training schools. They believed that this was the best way for families to protect their developmentally disabled child from the mistreatment that they would otherwise receive at the hands of society. In the early 1900's however, the reasoning transitioned from protecting individuals from society, to protecting society from individuals. It became accepted and encourag ed that placing a developmentally disabled child in a training school would protect marriages, siblings and even communities from potential harm. Between 1900 and 1925, the number of these \"schools\" grew in the United States from 10 to over 80. Small train ing schools became large institutions where the developmentally disabled were housed \"out of sight\" from daily life. With no oversight and the prevalence of ignorant perspectives regarding the developmentally disabled, horrific abuse became rampant and unc hecked as the original intention of training was abandoned almost entirely. A shift began again when, starting in the 1950's, parents began to take notice of worsening conditions. Working together, they demanded improved conditions and encouraged others to stop institutionalizing their disabled children. Appealing to the government for reform, their message took hold to change attitudes and inspire action. In the 1970's, significant legislative changes began to take shape providing for equal protection a nd opportunity under the law. The federal government began to require states to provide education and community services to families and individuals with developmental disabilities. In 2000, with the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, the federal government provided financial assistance to states and public and nonprofit agencies to support community- based delivery of services to persons with developmental disabilities. Washington State definition of Developmental Disability A disability attributable to: Intellectual Disability Cerebral Palsy Epilepsy Autism, or another neurological or other condition closely related to intellectual disability or that requires treatment similar to that required for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which: Originated before the individual attained age eighteen; Continued or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and Results in substantial limitations to an individual's intellectual and/or adaptive functioning.\" Understanding Developm ental Disabilities Intellectual Disabilities People with intellectual disability are individuals who have difficulty learning general knowledge as well as adaptive behavior. Adaptive behavior is the way an individual adjusts to the environment. When an individual has difficulty with adaptive behavior, he/she will also have difficulty meeting expectations for personal independence at his/her age level. Characteristics and Considerations Learns more slowly , but with time and patience can often learn new skil ls and acquire knowledge to the same level as those without disabilities. Has a more difficult time remembering things that are learned Has a more difficult time transferring what is learned from one situation to a new situation Thinks about things in more concrete ways Keeps learning and developing throughout life just like anyone else There are different levels of intellectual disability from mild to moderate to severe; therefore individuals need different types of assistance in daily living. Cerebral Palsy While most with Cerebral Palsy have average or above average intelligence, they have difficulty with body movement due to damage to the brain. Characteristics and Considerations May have limited control over their movements in one or more of the following ways: Excessive muscle tightening Awkward or involuntary movements Poor balance and poor motor coordination Speech difficulties Tremors or shaking that occur while trying to perform coordinated movements Cerebral refers to the brain and Palsy to a condition that affects physical movement Ranges from mild to severe People can lead more independent lives through physical therapy and the use of adaptive devices (for example, computers and wheelchairs). Epilepsy People with a diagnosis of epilepsy or seizure disorder tend to have recurring seizures, usually resulting from a disorder of the central nervous system. A seizure is often described as an abrupt electrical storm, or eruption, that occurs in the brain. Characteristics and Considerations Has seizures related to other health issues Can involve full body convulsions , brief partial movements, drop attacks, or lack of responsiveness (absence). Anything that the brain can do in its normal function, it can do abnormally in the form of a seizure. Frequently controlled by medications or VNS (Vagal Nerve Stimulus). Supports should be focused on safety and reassurance Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism is a spectrum of closely -related disorders with a shared core of symptoms. The level of disability and the combination of symptoms varies tremendously from person to person. Characteristics and Considerations Some of the most common symptoms include: Problems with social skills Difficulties with communication Difficulties reading or exhibiting typical emotional responses Repetitive and/or inflexible behaviors Problems with sensory integration. The level of disability and the combination of symptoms varies tremendously from person to person. In fact, two people with the same diagnosis may look very different when it comes to their behaviors and abilities. Some helpful ways to help an individual with autism include: Provide alternative forms of communication like sign language , PECS (Picture Exchange Commun ication System), communication software or electronic devices Look for sensitivity to sounds, taste, touch and environment and adapt as appropriate Follow routines based on person's preferences Other Developmental Disabilities People may have other neur ological conditions closely related to intellectual disability that could also qualify as a developmental disability. Characteristics and Considerations Includes people who need the same kinds of support as those who have intellectual disability. It does n ot include people who have only physical, learning, or mental health challenges. People with developmental disabilities may have both a diagnosis of the disability, and a mental health diagnosis, referred to as a \"dual diagnosis\" or \"co- occurring diagnosis.\" Principles of Normalization While everyone is unique, we are in many ways just as alike as we are different. We all have similar needs and wants. We all have the same rights. We all have feelings and can experience emotions such as love, loss, joy and embarrassment. We are all capab le of learning and personal development. We all desire to make our own decisions for our life. We all desire to contribute. We all desire to be valued. This is no less true for the individuals we support. The Principles of Normalization seeks to pursue a life for the individuals we support that is respectful of the similarities we share. Normalization does not emphasize how people with disabilities are different from others. Our different backgrounds, values and perspectives sometimes conflict with anothe r person's experiences. Often times, people mistakenly use their own standards as a yardstick for what is appropriate. This type of thinking reflects values that may not apply to others. Principles of Normalization stresses what people can do, rather than what they can't. It assumes that everyone can learn and has a need to grow. It places an emphasis on an individual's environment and the experiences they encounter. It understands that experiences can be planned which foster growth and learning. It is important to get to know the individuals you support to understand what is important to them and to assist them in living the life that they most desire. Guiding Values As a result of participating in this segment of training, you will be able to: 1. Identify the DDA Guiding Values 2. Defend the value of each of the Guiding Values 3. Relate the importance of the Guiding Values to their lives (as staff) and to the lives of those we support 4.

Competence inspires confidence, which is an essential component to personal development, well -being and contentment. Sometimes competence is developed through becoming more increasingly self- reliant and proficient. There are other areas where it is developed through the ability to seek and obtain assistance from others. For many of the individuals you will support, competence comes through a combination of both. The more competencies and skil ls an individual possesses, the more choices an individual will have in improving his/her image and status. Learning skills should occur in the context of real situations. Adults with a disability have often spent their w hole lives getting ready for a job or getting ready for living in the community. The best way to learn functional skills is through the experience of real jobs, homes, or communities and not in readiness programs. Each person and situation is unique: Some people with developmental disabilit ies need assistance to do what they need and want to do. Sometimes people will be able to learn, on their own, the things they need to know to be self -reliant. Sometimes they will need assistance to get what they need to get things done. Sometimes people will be able to direct their learning or direct the support they need. Sometimes people will need assistance to decide what to learn and how to direct their support system. People who receive services should have opportunities to be as self -reliant as possi ble and to determine the level, type, and provider of support they need. Effective programs ensure that an individual's lack of skills, or lack of ability to direct needed supports, are not ba rriers to choice, positive status, integration and relationships . To decide whether you support the building of competence, ask: Am I offering people opportunities to learn relevant skills they have indicated an interest in or a need to know? Am I supporting people in defining skills they would like to learn, and assessing the feasibility of mastering the skills in a reasonable period of time? Am I assisting people with activities in environments that are important to the person and relevant t o the activities? Am I providing people with the opportunity to be self -reliant? Am I providing direct assistance when an individual needs it, including back -up support when an individual tries to be self- reliant and is unsuccessful? Am I providing opportunities for people to use the skills they have, including skills of defining, negotiating, and directing the assistance they need? Health and Safety Whether it's understanding the social and health impact of good hygiene, identifying when there is a n eed to call the doctor, taking daily medication properly, or making healthy food and exercise choices, most people are capable of successfully making the required decisions or navigating through the processes of doing so on their own. Likewise, recognizing our vulnerabilities and taking the necessary preventative steps to be safe is something that most adults are able to manage on their own. For many individuals with developmental disabilities, they require assistance with one or more of these areas to kee p healthy and safe and be able to enjoy the fullness of life. As a Direct Support Professional, this is one of your most crucial roles. It will be extremely important for you to monitor, guide, assist, encourage, teach and advocate for the individuals you support, all while respecting their personal right to chose and make decisions for themselves. Integration Integration and inclusion are important for everyone. Feeling as though we are positively contributing to the community and to the individuals aro und us, fuels our passion and allows us to lead a vibrant life. Our ability to work, play, worship and volunteer our time is something that most of us have the ability to pursue without significant limits, outside of what our ti me and money affords. The importance of participating similarly is just as crucial to those with developmental disabilities. The individuals we support require our assistance, encouragement and coaching to lead a vibrant life of integration and inclusion. Not only is it important t hat we help them navigate through the resources available to them, it is equally important that we purposefully seek to engage them in activities that will introduce them to a wide variety of individuals and activiti es that exist in their community. Here a re a few questions to consider as you provide integration and inclusion opportunities in the life of the individuals you support: What are his/her current interests? What activities are available to pursue and enhance these interests? How can I assist in involving them in these activities? What new interests might the individual I support enjoy? How can I introduce them to him/her to see if this is something they would like to pursue? When we are out, am I focused primarily on his/her interests, choices and enjoyment level, and not on my own? Am I encouraging and assisting the individual I support to get out daily to and participate in the normal activities of shopping, eating out, going to parks, farmers markets, community events, worship and clubs? Am I assisting them to use available transportation to get where they need and want to go? Are there volunteer opportunities that they might be interested in helping with? How can I involve them? Are there classes and learning opportunities that the individual would be interested in taking? Relationships More often than not, our quality of life rests heavily on the quality of our relationships with others. Our relationships pro vide meaning, the o pportunity to give and to receive, personal value, support, continuity, adventure, love, laughter, memories, a sense of belonging, and personal growth. Unfortunately, for many of the individuals we support, their opportunities to pursue new and existing re lationships has been significantly limited. For some, their relationships are primarily only with those who provide services for them. As a DSP, one of your fundamental roles will be to assist in supporting existing family relationships and friendships, and to provide opportunities for the individual you support to establish new friendships through new opportunities to meet a wide variety of people. Here are a few questions to ask yourself as you follow through on this very important role: What are the ex isting relationships that are important to the individual I support? How do I provide opportunities for them to spend time with these family and/or friends? What more can I do? What opportunities within their neighborhood can I create or take advantage of to further existing relationships or inspire new ones? What opportunities for new relationship development might exist in clubs, associations, churches and volunteering? How can I assist to make those opportunities happen? How can I successfully model a he althy, respectful professional relationship with others and with the individual I support? Power and Choice One of the most profound benefits of our society is that it gives us the right and the ability to have power and choice over our own destiny. We st rive to experience power, control, and choice in our personal affairs. These expressions of personal power are essential elements that help us gain autonomy, be self -governing, and pursue our own interests and goals. For many with developmental disabilitie s, their right and/or ability to make complex lifetime choices, and even simple daily choices has been hampered by circumstances, physical limitations and/or misjudgments about their abilities based on cognitive limitations. As a Direct Support Professio nal, your role is to empower. Empowering the individual you support involves listening carefully to what each person is expressing in terms of desires, plans, and preferences and discern how each person is expressing those choices. Listening means paying a ttention and responding to the different ways people express themselves. It is important to constantly review how you are ensuring each person's right to have power over his or her life and whether the choices being made are theirs or yours. You can do thi s by looking at the following areas and asking yourself the following questions: Do I listen to the person and the person's friends and allies to discover individual goals and preferences? Do I demonstrate respect for individual choices, cultural and historical background and encourage the expression of each participant's individuality and personal power? Do I protect each person's personal and environmental privacy and legal rights? Do I assist participants learn about all their rights and responsibil ities and to act on what they learn? Do I actively support each person's pursuit of opportunities which are important to them, i.e. employment, volunteering, recreation, relationships and personal goals? Am I able to separate the difference between what I believe the individual I support \"should\" choose and what I want them to choose? Do I not let things like being busy, the complexity of communicating, my judgments about poor decisions or behavior, or my own discomfort interfere with my willingness to list en and their right to make choices? Status Our status comes from how we are valued by ourselves and by others. Positive recognition and self -esteem are extremely important to all of us. Unfortunately, the self -esteem and positive recognition of many of the individuals we support have been obstructe d by things such as cultural misperceptions and an absence of opportunities. A DSP's interaction with the individual they support has a powerful influence on how the person feels about him/herself and how they are seen or perceived by others. Ask yourse lf the following questions to see if you are promoting their status: Am I encouraging opportunities for their personal and professional growth and development? Am I respecting them as an adult with the same equal rights and decision making power that I am privileged with? Am I helping to increase their ability to become more competent and independent in daily living tasks? Am I helping others to recognize the individual's abilities rather than their limitations? Am I promoting activities to develop current and new interests? Am I promoting activities to develop current and new relationships? Am I offering ways of enhancing personal appearance? Am I assisting in making their home a warm and inviting environment? Qualities of a Meaningful Life A meaningful day comes from participating in activities and functions in the home and community that are desired and chosen by each individual. This can include: Purposeful and meaningful work Support for optimal health Self-empowerment and personal relatio nships Skill development and maintenance Social, educational and community activities that are linked to the vision, goals and desired personal outcomes Each individual's daily activities should result in self -empowerment, new relationships, work/volunteer experiences, memberships, valued roles, and skill -development, in addition to social, educational, and community inclusion that is consistent with the individual's desired outcomes. Most of these activities would be planned, purposeful, and reflected in daily schedules, however, meaningful activities also happen spontaneously. In order for an activity to be meaningful, it must be important to the individual and not an event to fill time. Activities that are meaningful to each individual might include opportunities for the following: Experiencing the routines of daily life that are important and non- negotiable (e.g., drinking coffee in the morning, reading the newspaper, walking to store) Exploring, securing, maintaining and/or changing suppor ted or competitive jobs Exploring, securing, maintaining and/or changing post -secondary educational activities Exploring, securing, maintaining and/or changing volunteer activities Experiencing and participating in community exploration, companionship with friends and peers Developing, maintaining and regularly experiencing chosen hobbies Maintaining family contacts Engaging in community events, education experiences, and those activities and services where people without disabilities are involved Exploring, learning and developing new skills to support participation and independence in the community and at home Exploring healthy lifestyles to include physical, spiritual and emotional well -being Your role is to offer opportunities and encourage activities that are meaningful to each individual. You can assist each individual in identifying what is meaningful to them, and you can offer and encourage meaningful activities throughout the day. Downtime is important, but if there is excessive downtime or time -fillers, the individual's quality of life is negatively affected.

The reason for a behavior can be described in terms of the reinforcement that is maintaining it and the favorable outcome that it creates. People engage in millions of different behavio rs each day, but the reasons for doing these different behaviors fall into one or more of the following three main categories. Category one includes motivations related to getting something. These could be things like pleasure, attention, respect, power, privilege, and objects. This category also includes \"Automatic reinforcement\" which occurs when a person's behavior creates a favorable outcome for them while no other person was involved in any way. This includes things like finger \"flapping\", knee jiggling or other behaviors where the person receives a positive outcome. It feels good, it's calming or just makes them happy. The second category includes motivations related to avoiding something. These could include avoiding work, avoiding social situations, avoiding embarrassment, and avoiding stress. This category includes motivations related to stopping something from conti nuing. These could include things like pain, discomfort, and negative sensory stimuli. Setting Events and Triggers Setting Events are contributing factors that could increase the likelihood of the behavior occurring. They are a variety of things that potentially \"set the table\" for behavior to take place. These could include things such as health related problem s, lack of knowledge or ability, poor self -regulation skills, ongoing social and emotional issues, and environmental factors. Below is a list of sample setting events by category. PHYSICAL/MEDICAL SOCIAL/PSYCHOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL Illness Discomfort Disappointment Fear Moving Weather Constipation Sensory issues Loss Call from friend Noise level Being late Allergies Missed Meal Depression Recent argument Boredom Being rushed Sexual anxiety Hunger/thirst Anger issues Trauma history Lack of routine Miscommunication Medication side effects Chronic health issues Anxiety over upcoming event Planning a vacation Lack of stimulation Overcrowding Temperature Pain Sleep pattern disruption Major life change Low impulse control Disrupted routine Unfamiliar surroundings Lack of experience Low tolerance for frustration Change of support staff Confusion regarding directions Lack of situational comprehension Heightened need of attention Poor planning Absence of organization Triggers Triggers are the immediate prompts that provoke the behavior. They can be a wide variety of prompts. Some examples include a request or demand, a comment, refusal or presentation of food, an object or an activity, losing a game, or a message. Functional Assessments Functional assessments at tempt to determine the function (purpose) of an individual's behaviors. They seek to identify the logic behind someone's behaviors and serve as the foundation for developing a prevention- focused Positive Behavior Support plan as well as intervention and pr oactive action plans to provide instructional and environmental supports, effective communication strategies, reinforcement methods and reactive approaches. Functional Assessments are created through a combination of direct observation of the individual , consulting with relevant professionals, interviewing family and staff members, and reviews of prior assessments, incident reports and other related documentation. The information is then used to define specific negative behaviors, identify times and situations where they will occur and describe the functions that the negative behavior produces for the individual. Some of the areas that are assessed include an individual's current and past relationships, their environment, communication abilities and prac tices, skills and abilities, personal history, interests, diagnosis, medications and possible setting events and triggers. Environmental Elements that Support Positive Behavior Environment contributes more significantly to how we \"feel\" than we are consci ously aware. To provide the best assistance to individuals and proactively support their positive choices, we need to be keenly aware of environmental factors that may impede their choices. Here are just a few things to keep in mind: Noisy environments c an create anxiety for some individuals. Some people have significant issues with uncomfortable clothing and other tactile sensitivities. Temperature can impact people differently. Remember that it is their comfort level that is the priority, not yours. An overly busy or chaotic environment can produce negative behaviors for some individuals. Are there changes that could be made that would help with comfort? What kind of accessibility improvements could be made for those with mobility issues? Are there envi ronment changes or potential changes that can cause problems? Is their home decorated and furnished according to what makes them happy? Do they feel a sense of pride and ownership? Is the home clean and free of clutter? Are there safe and comfortable places to relax outside? Is there a wide variety of activities of interest to the individual in the home? Are they easily accessible? Are clocks and calendars easy to locate and read? Dignity and Respect in Daily Interactions \"In my early professional years I was asking the question: How can I treat, or cure, or change this person? Now I would phrase the question in this way: How can I provide a relationship which this person may use for his own perso nal growth?\" - Carl Rogers Building positive relations hips is rooted in respect. Positive relationships promote trust, cooperation and growth. Whether we intend to or not, we serve as models for the individuals we support. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you grow and model a relationship with the individual you support. Your behaviors and words should always match. Do what you say; say what you do. Practice and demonstrate empathy. Extend unconditional, positive respect. Respect is not earned; it is to be freely given. Abolish judgment. It is usually rooted in self -righteousness. Be collaborative and helpful whenever possible. Treat all adults as adults. Value and respect them accordingly. Use age appropriate communication. Seek understanding. Seeking to understand rat her than to be understood demonstrates the highest respect. Acknowledge them in all circumstances. Seek their participation and presence. Listen intently. Give them your undivided attention. Always be truthful. Use respectful body language and tone of voi ce in all conversations. Accept their individuality and idiosyncrasies. Power Struggles Power struggles are an attempt to create power over another individual, retain a position of power or establish a sense of personal empowerment through taking it from someone else. They can occur when we are unbendable, when someone has a need to \"win,\" or when someone feels personally powerless. Unfortunately, they are always a lose -lose proposition for everyone involved, build resentment and distrust, set the state fo r aggression and negative behaviors, and increase the likelihood of future power struggles. Here are tips for avoiding and dealing with power struggles. The more power and choice an individual has in their life, the less frequently they initiate power struggles. Be certain to provide power and choice frequently. Even small, seemingly insignificant choices can go a long way to helping an individual to feel empowered. When an individual makes a decision that turns out poorly, don't 'rub it in.' Be empathetic and encouraging. Don't start power struggles!! Our lack of flexibility, our need to keep things \"under control,\" our incorrect viewpoint of ourselves as an \"authority figure,\" our tendency to take things personally, and even our desire to ensur e the \"best\" for someone can overwhelm our ability to see clearly. Don't take the bait. Sometimes, things are said or done just to provoke a response from you. Don't react. Create a win -win whenever possible. You don't need to come out on top. This isn't parenting! Don't be afraid to \"lose.\" As a matter of fact, be sure to apologize and ask for their forgiveness if you're wrong. Don't involve others. A larger audience creates a more powerful desire to \"win\" in order to avoid looking bad in front of others . The Escalation Cycle People get upset. Upset people often engage in challenging behaviors. Challenging behaviors can escalate into a behavioral crisis. As an individual escalates, simple agitation behaviors such as arguing, pacing, rocking, and raised voices can become intimidation behaviors that involve swearing, name calling and verbal threats. The highest form of an escalation cycle is violence. The violence can occur against property, another person, or even themselves. It's important that we learn how to recognize the escalation cycle and how to respond to help an individual de -escalate. Here are some things to remember when dealing with the escalation cycle. Provide them with your undivided attention. Allow them to vent. Listen for feelings and ack nowledge them. Their feelings are what is causing them problems, not the situation. If we focus on the situation, we're not focusing on the true problem. During the agitation phase, ask \"Can we sit down? I'd really like to hear more about this .\" Sitting down can help de - escalate. But even if they refuse, your genuine desire to listen to them can help. Let them have their feelings without judging them or correcting them, no matter how strong the feelings are. As agitation increases in the individual you s upport, you must not allow your own anxiety to increase as well. If you become anxious, angry or upset it will only serve to exacerbate their emotions. Use reflective listening skills. Do not take their escalation personally - even if they begin accusing y ou or calling you names. Use a calming, steady voice. Don't try to match their pace or volume. Speak more quietly and slowly. If what you are doing or saying is increasing their anxiety instead of calming them, more than likely, what you're doing isn't w orking. Try something else. De-escalation Don'ts!! Don't say \"calm down.\" Don't lecture, use logic or persuasion. Don't tell them how they \"should\" feel. Don't try to solve the problem. Don't tell them how they \"should\" see things. Don't get defensive. Don't rush them. Don't interrogate by asking a lot of questions. Don't rush to resolution or problem solving. Don't focus on the situation. Focus on feelings. Don't minimize their feelings or perceptions. Don't criticize them or their feelings. Don't tell them that \"it will be okay.\" Don't get pulled into triangulation. Effective Communication 1.Demonstrate 5 different types of communication. 2.Apply active listening 3.Demonstrate ethical and respectful interactions with people who have developmental disabilities As a result of participating in this segment of training, learners will be able to: (no pens - listening only ) What impact could miscommunication have on... My personal life The individual I support The relationship with the individual I support Relationships within a support team Relationships with DDA caseworkers The relaying of necessary information from doctors Relationships with family of individuals I support How can mi scommunication occur in each of the following communication situations ? Tone of Eye contact Facial Gestu res/Body L Volume Pace Touch Proximity Sounds NON -VERBAL S I'm sorry if I hurt you. I hurt you, and I'm really sorry that I did that. I'm sorry. I really didn't mean anything by it. I wasn't even thinking about it. I'm sorry. Things have been crazy and I've been so busy lately. I'm sorry, but if you had told me ahead of time, I wouldn't have rushed ahead. I didn't think about how this was going to impact you. I'm sorry for being selfish. I haven't been paying attention to you lately. I'm sorry that I've hurt you. I'm sorry. I should have checked with you first. This is really my fault. What's the Difference? Effective Communication Write the skills and behaviors in the boxes below. Allows others to contribute more to finding solutions Allows others to open up and talk about themselves more Increases the level of true listening Builds relationships by increasing understanding Can be used to guide someone towards positive choices Allows the listener to gather more information and understand better _____________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________ Reflective listening is an ______________ listening skill used in highly stressful or emotional conversations. By CLARIFYING and RESTATING what the other person is saying, the listener is able to stay \" PRESENT \" as they seek to genuinely understand what is being said and empathize with the emotions the individual is experiencing. It provides the speaker with the opportunity to safely DE-ESCALATE as they feel CARED FOR and \" HEARD .\" Reflective Listening A B Reflective listening validates a person's perspective and/or actions. or Reflective listening communicates acceptance of a person's feelings. Trying to solve someone's problem while they are upset can make things worse. or The primary goal of reflective listening is to help them solve their problems. It's more important that someone feels understood, than it is that they be told that things will be okay. or It's more important that someone be told that things will be okay than it is for them to feel understood. Reflective listening elevates emotions. or Reflective listening builds trust. Reflective listening can communicate \"tell me more.\" or Reflective listening communicates logic and reason. People solve problems better when their emotions are heightened. or People solve problems better when their emotions are not heightened. \"It Sounds like....\" \"You seem....\" \"I can \"Tell me more about that.\" \"So I understand, what I think I hear you saying...\" \"So you're feeling...\" \"So you're saying...\" Improv it. Individuals who communicate primarily nonverbally, understand what is being said and what is going on around them better than most people realize. Responses that cue understanding are sometimes atypical, so it's important to learn the unique responses of each individual you support. Individuals who communicate nonverbally often use multiple communication methods that comprise their own personal expression. These can involve symbolic gestures, eye pointing and gestures, signing, vocal sounds, touch, object references and environmental cues. With time and patience, Assistive Communication methods can be especially helpful. These include visual picture supports, drawing, alphabet boards, word and/or symbol cards, calendars, clocks, and technology aids. Some of these can be easily created using flash cards, hand -held white boards, bulletin boards, note pads and tablets. A high level of engagement and interaction is required for successful communication to take place. Additionally, a commitment and desire to understand is crucial. Do not give up, as doing so leads to significant frustration as the individual is unable to get their needs and wants met. A long term history of not getting one's needs and wants met can lead to rapid frustration for anyone. Historically for some individuals, it was not until escalated emotions and behaviors appeared that their needs were finally met. The more engaged you become and the more effective you become at understanding the unique communication methods of the individual you support, the less likely they will feel the n eed to escalate to be \"heard.\" Chapter 5 Effective Staff Communication Reflective Listening Reflective listening is an empathetic listening skill used in stressful or emotional conversations. By clarifying and restating what the other person is saying, the listener is able to stay \" present \" as they seek to genuinely understand what is being said and empathize with the emotions the individual is experiencing. It provides the speaker with the opportunity to safely de-escalate as they feel cared for and \"heard.\" Active Listing Skills and Attending Behaviors Examples of Positive Active Listening and Attending Behaviors Thoughts Is \"present\" and listens to what the other person is saying rather than trying to think about what to say next Looks beyond words and listens for feelings Does not make assumptions about the other person's intentions Listens to understand another's perspectiv e Waits until the other person is finished speaking Provides undivided attention Body Language and Gestures Leans forward when listening Faces the person when listening Has \"open\" body language Head movements respond with sincere interest (nodding, cocking head to listen better) Facial expressions respond empathetically to what is being said Mirrors physical posture of the person they're listening to Vocal Qualities and Verbal Tracking Vocal tone is respectful, safe and genuine Voice sounds neither attacking nor defensive Doesn't change the subject inappropriately Makes empathetic sounds and comments Asks questions to find out more Eye Contact Maintains eye contact throughout Eye contact is empathetic and caring Examples of Negative Active Listening and Attending Behaviors Thoughts Thinks about what they're going to say next rather than listening to what is being said Listens only for surface issues Makes assumptions about what the other person is going to say or what their intentions are Listens to confirm one's own perspective Interrupts Multitasks while supposedly listening Body Language and Gestures Keeps a distance when listening Is continually distracted by other things; obviously not paying attention Has \"closed\" body language, folded arms, etc. Does not have body movements that suggest empathy or a sincere desire to listen Facial expressions are either critical, defensive or aloof Physical posture contrasts what the other person feels Vocal Qualities and Verbal Tracking Vocal tone is defensive, suspicious or distant Voice sounds doubtful, defensive or attacking Changes the subject when bored or uncomfortable Absence of vocal affirmation sounds -doesn't respond Asks questions to change the subject, prove their own point, or doesn't ask questions at all; shows disinterest Eye Contact Avoids eye contact Eye contact is disinterested, displays distrust or is continually distracted SIGN LANGUAGE PECS and Social Stories 10 Tips on Nonverbal Communication 1. Pay Attention to Nonverbal Signals Pay attention to things like eye contact, gestures, posture, body movements, and tone of voice. All of these signals can convey important information that isn't put into words. 2. Look for Incongruent Behaviors Research has shown that when words fail to match up with nonverbal signals, people tend to ignore what has been said and focus instead on nonverbal expressions of moods, thoughts, and emotions. 3. Concentrate on Your Tone of Voice When Speaking Your tone of voice can convey a wealth of information, ranging from enthusiasm to disinterest to anger. Start noticing how your tone of voice affects how others respond to you and try using tone of voice to emphasize ideas that you want to communicate. 4. Use Good Eye Contact While eye contact is an important part of communication, it's important to remember that good eye contact does not mean staring fixedly into someone's eyes. How can you tell how much eye contact is correct? Some communication experts recommend intervals of eye contact lasting four to five seconds. 5. Ask Questions about Nonverbal Signals If you are confused about another person's nonverbal signals, don't be afraid to ask questions. A good idea is to repeat back your interpretation of what has been said and ask for clarification. 6. Use Signals to Make Communication More Effective and Meaningful You can improve your spoken communication by using nonverbal signals and gestures that reinforce and support what you are saying. This can be especially useful when making presentations or when speaking to a large group of people. 7. Look at Signals as a Group A single gesture can mean any number of things, or maybe even nothing at all. The key to accurately reading nonverbal behavior is to look for groups of signals that reinforce a common point. 8. Consider Context When you are communicating with others, always consider the situation and the context in which the communication occurs. If you are trying to improve your own nonverbal communication, concentrate on ways to make your signals match the level of formality necessitated by the situation. 9. Be Aware That Signals Can be Misread Always remember to look for groups of behavior. A person's overall demeanor is far more telling than a single gesture viewed in isolation. 10. Practice, Practice, Practice Build your ability to \"read people\" by paying careful attention to nonverbal behavior and practicing different types of nonverbal communication with others. By noticing nonverbal behavior and practicing your own skills, you can dramatically improve your communication abilities. http://psychology.about.com/od/nonverbalcommunication/tp/nonverbaltips.htm Habilitation Skills 1.Apply the Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic (VAK) learning styles to themselves 2.Describe the importance of relationship -building skills when creating a successful learning environment 3.Identify conditions to develop a trusting rapport 4.Apply 3 specific teaching techniques in a given instructional situ ation 5.Apply teaching strategies for people with developmental disabilities 6.Name two teaching strategies 7.Demonstrate three methods of teaching for people with developmental disabilities As a result of participating in this segment of training, learners w ill be able to: Learning Styles Test Read each situation and choose how you would most likely respond.

I most enjoy the experience and I feel compelled to touch everything. If I'm listening to a sermon or lecture, I would prefer to... Look at projected visuals Listen. Period. Doodle while I listen. In an all -day workshop, the most difficult part for me is... Trying to pay attention when my friends want to talk. Suffering through all the interruptions. Sitting still for too long. Can we take a break soon? TALLY VISUAL AUDITORY KINESTHETIC Adults learn best When: ...They understand why ...They are respected ...They are able to contribute ...They understand what's in it for them My body makes me disabled; society makes me handicapped. -Anonymous Systematic instruction is a systemized plan for teaching a task or skill. It usually involves repetition and consistency in order to be most effective. Systematic Instruction & Task Analysis Task Analysis breaks down tasks into simple, singular steps that can be easily explained and performed. Task The individual you support is taking his first trip to the ocean. Although he is excited, he also has high levels of anxiety when it comes to going places he's never been to before. What kinds of things can you do to teach him about what his beach experi ence will be like and what he can look forward to, using his primary learning style if his learning style were: Visual, Auditory, or Kinesthetic VISUAL AUDITO KINEST Backwards Chaining Backwards Chaining is an instruction method where all of the behaviors in a single task are completed by the trainer except the last step. The learner is then prompted to complete the last step in the task. Once the learner has demonstrated independence in completion of the last step, the trainer then completes all steps except the last two, prompting the learner to complete the last two steps independently. This sequence proceeds backward through the chain u ntil all the steps in the task have been learned and can be performed independently. The amount of time and repetition required to learn each step varies with each individual. Hierarchy of Prompting Can perform task List the benefits of Backwards Chaining. 2 4 3 6 7 1 5 Chapter 6 Habilitation Skills As we assist individuals, it's crucial that we focus on our role as \"Instructional Support.\" Remembering the first Service Guideline - Competence - it's important for us to develop our training skills. Learning Styles - VAK There are three primary sensory learning styles: Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic. We use all three to learn, but it is very common that each person has a primary style. This style is not only the primary method we learn from, but it is also the primary method we use to instruct others. It's important to know what our own tendencies are and be mindful that others may have a different style that ours, and be able to accommodate their preferences to best meet their learning needs. Below are descriptions of each learning style. Visual - Visual learners prefer to learn by seeing, watching or imagining. They do well with the use of pictures, color coding, maps and videos. Auditory - Auditory learners pref er to learn through sounds and hearing. They do well with listening activities, rea ding, and activities involving discussion. Kinesthetic - Kinesthetic learners prefer to learn by touching, feeling and movement. They do well with hands on activities, experiences, stories and movies that can be emotionally experienced, and activities tha t require movement. Doodling or performing a \"mindless\" activity while listening can help with learning. Systematic Instruction and Task Analysis Structured teaching, also known as task analysis or systematic teaching is a process of breaking the skill do wn into smaller steps. Structured teaching is used when: 1. Safety is an issue. It might be due to use of machinery or other safety concerns. 2. When the individual needs to learn in small steps. Many people with Autism need to have the skills they are learni ng broken into smaller steps, start from left to right, have the prompt for the next step built in to the process, use of a jig and other structured methods before they can learn. Do you think it might have been helpful if you could have used a jig as par t of your training for the last activity? 3. When quality is an issue. These are considered when a person is completing tasks for work. In supported living, the tasks we teach are also measured so there will be documentation for teaching methods that will be taught as you learn about each person's programs. Please pay close attention to this documentation. The purpose of documentation is to: ensure growth in the individual's progress ensure that the teaching is consistent between trainers ensure that feedb ack is given to the program writer so that the program can be adjusted as needed know when to set new learning tasks for growth in a meaningful life Your role is to be consistent in teaching. That's consistent with yourself and with other people who are a lso training the task. Imagine learning something from 5 different people and trying to make sense of their instructions. Each one is teaching in the way they like to learn and now how you like to learn. What do you imagine is going on in their heads? Take some answers (confusion, they give up trying) the good news is that in the next chapter, we will learn more about IISPs where you can find the training programs for each individual along with the instructions you are to follow. Hierarchy of Prompting \"Prompts\" are i nstructions, gestures, demonstrations, touches, or other things that are done to assist individuals in learning a new task or skill. Using a hierarchy of prompting is a systematic progression of decreasing the level from most assistance needed to least assistance needed. Not every person or every task begins at the lowest level (full physical assistance prompts), but the ultimate goal for every task is independence; no assistance needed. 6. Highest level: Independence; no assistance needed 5. Indirect verbal/nonverbal prompts: Does not tell - says things like \"What's next?\" and may gesture with head nods or eye cues 4. Direct verbal/nonverbal prompts: Will point or say what needs to be done or said next 3. Modeling pro mpts: Demonstrates what needs to said or done next 2. Partial physical assistance prompts: Limited physical assistance required, such as prompting by touching elbow or hand 1. Full physical assistance prompts: For those who first require full \"hand over hand\" assistance 1. Full physical assistance is used when the person doesn't seem to understand other directions. You stand or sit right next to the person or directly across from them so they can make eye contact. By placing your hand over theirs and doing the movements required you begin to build that muscle memory that we already discussed. It's habit or just something you do without thinking. When teaching people with developmental disabilities it is used when people have had no training or you j ust can't seem to get them started. 2. Partial physical assist could be a nudge on the elbow to get the arm moving or a tap on the shoulder to get attention. 3. Modeling is showing the person what they are going to do and doing it right next to them. Modeling s tarts at a very young age when a child first learns to eat. What do you do when feeding a child their first spoonful of whatever? You open your mouth until they open theirs! It's a great teaching tool and no words are necessary! 4. Direct verbal means that you are telling the person what to do at each step. This is the most difficult step to fade away from. You may have a voice in your head telling you to check for people on the sidewalks but in reality no one is telling you how to drive your car when you are alone behind the wheel. 5. Indirect verbal prompts are a combination of gestures and speaking. More gestures and fewer words here! You begin to reposition yourself from right next to to next to but slightly behind. You are still close enough to assist and gesture without being in the line of sight. As a person, you are part of the prompt. Your physical appearance in the peripheral vision of the individual doing the task may mean that they won't reach independence if you are still in the picture. 6. Independence is what we all are in our daily lives. We get up, eat breakfast, shower, shave, drive to work, do our jobs and go home. We go out, make plans for the weekend, see our friends. I t's what we all want for the people we support. They should have no less of a life than you do. Benefits of Backwards Chaining 1. When an individual experiences immediate success, the reward reinforces learning 2. Because the learner only needs to initially r emember the last step, this is less taxing on short term memory 3. Eliminates the frustration of starting and not being able to finish, or getting lost in the middle 4. Learner is significantly more likely to stay involved in bot h the immediate and long term learning process 5. Is an easier method of teaching for the instructor, is more rewarding and prevents them from being tempted to finish the task themselves (which inhibits learning) 6. Because the experience is highly rewarding for both the learner and the instructor, it can also have a positive impact on the relationship 7. Over time with repetition, skill is more successfully transferred to long term memory Error Free Learning A type of learning that is frequently not discussed is error free learning. This is used when a new skill is being taught and you don't want any errors. Have you ever heard, \"Let's practice the RIGHT way!\"? Well it means that you don't want to practice mistakes. You want to do it correctly every time. Error free training interrupts the stops and starts in a process, the requirement to ask for permission, and any number of other things. As a staff, you would watch as the task is performed and interrupt the part that isn't a step in the learning process. You would actually body block, move a hand to the next step or do other interrupting types of things. You might use your voice and make a sound. Moms use this when they clear their throats, give a look - you know the one, or say one word that signals fo r you to do the right thing. Take the next correct step. IISP Support Plans As a result of participating in this segment of training, you will be able to: 1. Recognize the difference and use of an Individual Service Plan ISP (state's assessment) and an Individual Instruction and Support Plan IISP (agency's plan to support person) 2. Recall attributes of the IISP 3. Debate the merits of at least 3 key elements of interactive planning by explaining the value of each element, or the loss th at would occur if the element were not included in the planning 4. Recognize sections or domains of an Individual Instruction and Support Plan (IISP) 5. Generalize the broad range of activities that may be considered when developing individual plans 6. Distinguish between what is \"important to\" the individual and what is \"important for\" the individual 7. Recount the process from which interactive plans are developed Competence Health and Safety Inclusion Relationships Power and Choice Status and Contribution Support Plan Domains Guiding Values Key Elements of Interactive Planning Team Approach People who know and care about the person are in this together for him/her Collaboration Input from team members based on the person's desire to meet his/her goa ls and an improved quality of life Invention and Experimentation Trying new things and beating a new path pas t former obstacles if necessary Interests and Choice A person centered approach of not just what is important to him/her but also important for him/her Think outside the box! Instead of thinking of obstacles to overcome, think outside the box. How would it impact a person's life if we could help them discover new hobbies, pursuits and solutions? Communicating with indi viduals from their perspective: what is important to them , (Satisfaction, contentment, comfort, happiness) rather than from our perspective: what we believe is important for them (Health and Safety and important to others that this person is a valued member of their community) is not only more person -centered , it is more effective and motivating . There must be a balance between the two. IISP Support Plans Example of Teachable Steps for Using a Phone Grasp phone receiver. Lift receiver to above the shoulder. Place listening part of receiver to ear. Using the other hand, touch the first number to be entered on the cue card and say it aloud. Move your finger to the matching number printed on the phone and push buttons. Push the button on the telephone. Repeat steps 4 -6 for each number. Pause and listen for phone to ring. Independence Indirect verbal and nonverbal Direct verbal and nonverbal Modeling Partial physical assistance Full physical assistance How would you instruct an individual using prompts? Chapter 7 Individual and Instruction Support Plan (IISP) Creating the Plan Each individual will have a support plan that will guide you to help them to achieve their vision and goals for their lives. You will read each person's plan to gain a better understanding of his or her needs, historical information, for example where he came from, health care needs, medications he t akes, guardian status, and more. There are multiple plans to be considered that make up the IISP. To develop the IISP the support team comes together to discuss with the individual, their goals and the plan to achieve those goals. The meeting that is held is referred to as the Person C entered Planning meeting and is made up of the individual, their family members of their choosing, a Guardian if they have one, friends of their choosing, the case manager, familiar staff and the person writing the plan. The individual may also select a N ecessary Supplemental Accommodation Representative (NSA) of their choosing to help advocate for their wants and needs. An Individual Support Plan (ISP) is developed with the case manager, the individual and others of their choice. The purpose of the ISP is to determine supports needed to assist the individual to meet their goals. This assessment determines a support level of numbers 1 -6 which also determines the amount of funding needed. Additional plans will be developed for financial, communication, t herapies, and other items determined by the assessment or by the team based on knowledge of the individuals wants and needs. All of these additional plans are part of the IISP and will contain information related to support of the individual. For our pur poses in this training we focused on determining the activities of a meaningful life and how they fit into the residential guidelines. Each year, the team gets together to create a new plan by evaluating progress and making adjustments accordingly. Work ing the Plan As you meet the people you work with, you will also read their support plans, and look at their goals. DSPs with a history of supporting the person will show you how to best support the person and follow the IISP based on the relationship they have established with the person. Keep in mind that while you all have different personalities, strengths, and weaknesses, it is also imperative that you get t o know each individual's personality, strengths, and weaknesses and understand what drives or inspires them. Come to know what their motivation is, what attention span limits might exist, as well as their rate of learning. Adjust your own processe s so your support methods match their personality and what works best for them. Motivations can be internal or external. You go to bed earlier than your usual time because you are tired (internal) and you have to be at work very early tomorrow (external). Or you take a shower because a skin condition feels better in warm water (internal) but you know yo ur chances for employment are better if you smell okay (external). Attention span and frequency varies for each of person. Some people could work for hours on following a specific recipe to make a souffl\u00e9 while others are going to be happy with a cooked e gg! So how much time will a person be willing to spend to learn a new task? And in the context of learning to make a souffl\u00e9 how frequently do people make souffl\u00e9s? If it is a required task at a job, then probably quite frequently, but if it is just a holi day occasion, then frequency is rare. Rate of Learning refers to how fast of a learner a person is and also how much practice a person needs to master a skill. This also can be affected by motivation, attention span, learning and teaching styles, difficu lty of the task, and the effectiveness of the reinforcement. A fast learner can have more robust goals while a person who learns more slowly will need fewer more basic tasks drawn out over a longer period of time with more opportunities to practice to beco me efficient. Pace of teaching and teaching styles are also determined by the interest level and learning preference of the person and the teaching skills of the coach. A good coach will use many tactics including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic opport unities to help teach a desired skill. The pace will be set by the person who really must go at his or her own pace. Always remember: it is really crucial to have a relationship with the learner, to engage with him or her within the learning activity bu t also outside of it. Being able to maintain interest in the task and performing the task during the actual time of day when the task is typically done will help to guide the normal rate or pace of the activity. Nutrition and Dietary Guidelines As a result of participating in this segment of training, learners will be able to: 1.List the basic food groups 2.Find at least 1 benefit of each food group based on the guidelines of the USDA (ChooseMyPlate.gov) 3.Construct what counts for serving sizes of common foods using visuals and/or manipulatives 4.Take part in creating balanced & complete menu plans on the Weekly Menu Plan form 5.Distinguish at l east 3 important aspects of menu planning for someone with Diabetes 6.Defend how menu planning for someone with Diabetes would be integrated into a sample Weekly Menu Plan 7.Demonstrate how to read labels for nutrition value per portion size 8.Identify 3 ways to involve supported individuals in the menu planning process 9.Recommend at least 3 benefits of hydration 10.List 2 symptoms each of poor nutrition and dehydration, when and whom to report symptoms of concern 11.Distinguish different categories of fats 12.Recognize ideal sodium intake levels 13.Contrast empty and nutrient -rich calories 14.Associate careless food handling with the potential for foodborne illness 15.Illustrate 4 safe food handling practices 16.Generalize the purpose of a grocery store layout 17.Prepare a shopping list based on a created Menu Plan Nutrition and Dietary Guidelines Breakfast Lunch Dinner Snacks Beverages One Day Meal Plan Portion Size Savvy Match the serving size of each food by drawing a line to the picture that best represents what that size would look like. FOOD TYPE 1600 CALORIES PER DAY 2000 CALORIES PER DAY EXAMPLES OF 1 SERVING Grains At least half of your servings should be whole- grain. 6 servings 6-8 servings 1 slice bread 1 oz dry cereal (check nutrition label for cup measurements of different products) 1/2 cup cooked rice, pasta, or cereal (about the size of a baseball) Vegetables Eat a variety of colors and types 3-4 servings 4-5 servings 1 cup raw leafy vegetables (about the size of a small fist) 1/2 cup cut -up raw or cooked vegetables 1/2 cup vegetable juice Fruits Eat a variety of colors and types 4 servings 4-5 servings 1 medium fruit (about the size of a baseball) 1/4 cup dried fruit 1/2 cup fresh, frozen, or canned fruit 1/2 cup fruit juice Fat-free or low -fat dairy Products 2-3 servings 2-3 servings 1 cup fat -free or low -fat milk 1 cup fat -free or low -fat yogurt 1 and 1/2 oz fat -free or low -fat cheese (about the size of 6 stacked dice) Lean meats, poultry, and seafood 3-6 oz (cooked) Less than 6 oz 3 oz cooked meat (about the size of a computer mouse) 3 oz grilled fish (about the size of a checkbook) Fats and oils Use liquid vegetable oils and soft margarine most often 2 servings 2-3 servings 1 tsp soft margarine 1 Tbsp mayonnaise 1 tsp vegetable oil 1 Tbsp regular or 2 Tbsp low -fat salad dressing (fat-free dressing does not count as a serving) Nuts, seeds, and legumes 3-4 servings 4-5 servings 1/3 cup or 1 and 1/2 oz nuts 2 Tbsp peanut butter 2 Tbsp or 1/2 oz seeds 1/2 cup dry beans or peas Sweets and added sugars 0 servings per week 5 or fewer servings per week 1 Tbsp sugar 1 Tbsp jelly or jam 1/2 cup sorbet and ices 1 cup lemonade Servings per Food Group Healthy Eating & Diabetes Define Your Plate Use a rule of three. This can help you lose weight and manage your diabetes by eating more non- starchy foods. Divide your plate in half. Fill one side with vegetables like spinach, broccoli, carrots, or green beans. Next, divide the empty side into two hal ves. Use one for starchy foods such as potatoes, whole grains like brown rice or quinoa or whole - grain bread or pasta. In the last section, add meat or another protein. On top of that you can also have an 8 ounce glass of low -fat milk and a half -cup of fruit. Vegetables have little effect on blood sugar. Meats and other proteins can slightly raise blood sugar. Grains and other starchy vegetables raise blood sugar. Fruits Vegetables Proteins Grains Dairy Vegetables Proteins Grains Turn to the Food Group Benefits in the \"Fundamentals\" se ction to find the nutrients and health of benefits of each of the Five Food Groups. The Five Food Groups Grains Vegetables Fruits Proteins Dairy Fats and Oils Food Group Benefits Currently, many of the foods and beverages Americans eat and drink contain empty calories - calories from solid fats and/or added sugars. Solid fats and added sugars add calories to the food but few or no nutrients. For this reason, the c alories from solid fats and added sugars in a food are often called \"empty calories.\" Solid fats and added sugars can make a food or beverage more appealing, but they also can add a lot of calories. The foods and beverages that provide the most empty calories for Americans are: Cake, cookies, pastries, and donuts (contain both solid fat and added sugars) Sodas, energy drinks, sports drinks, and fruit drinks (contain added sugars) Ice cream (contain both solid fat and added sugars) Sausages, hot dogs, bacon, and ribs (contain solid fat) These foods and beverages are the major sources of empty calories, but many can be found in forms with less or no solid fat or added sugars. For example, low -fat cheese and low -fat hot dogs can be purchased. You can choose water, milk or sugar -free soda instead of drinks with sugar. Check that the calories in these products are less than in the regular product. Solid fats are fats that are solid at room temperature, like butter, beef fat, and shortening. Some solid fats are found naturally in foods. They can also be added when foods are processed by food companies or when they are prepared. Added sugars are sugars and syrups that are prepared. What are empty calories? Fat-free milk Unsweetened applesauce Lean ground beef Unsweetened cereals Baked chicken breast without skin Fat-free milk Unsweetened applesauce Lean ground beef Unsweetened cereals Baked chicken breast without skin In some foods, like most candies and sodas, all the calories are empty calories. These are called \"empty calorie foods.\" However, empty calories from solid fats and added sugars can also be found in some other foods that contain important nutrients. Look a t the diagram below to see which foods have some empty calories, and which foods have no empty calories. Foods with few or no empty calories Foods with some empty calories Unsweetened applesauce Fat-free milk Baked chicken breast without skin Unsweet ened cereal Extra lean ground beef (95% lean or more) Sweetened applesause Whole milk Fried chicken Sweetened cereal Regular lean ground beef 1.1200 mg 2.2300 mg 3.1500 mg Look for foods that are rich in these nutrients. - Use the label not only to limit fat and sodium, but also to increase nutrients that promote good health and may protect you from disease. - Some Americans don't get enough vitamins A and C, potassium, calcium, and iron, so choose the brand with the higher % DV for these nutrients. - Get the most nutrition for your calories - compare the calories to the nutrients you would be getting to make a healthier food choice. 4 The % Daily Value is key to a balanced diet. - This section tells whether the nutrients (total fat, sodium, dietary fiber, etc.) in one serving contribute a little or a lot to your total daily diet. - The %DVs are based on a 2000 calorie diet. Each listed nutrient is based on 100% of the recommended amounts for that nutrient. For example, 18% for total fat means that one serving furnishes 18% of the total amount of fat that you could eat in a day and stay within public health recommendations. Use the Quick Guide to Percent DV (%DV): 5%DV or less is low and 20%DV or more is high. - The footnote provides information about the DVs for important nutrients, including fats, sodium and fiber. The DVs ar e listed for people who eat 2000 or 2500 calories each day. - The amounts for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium are maximum amounts. That means you should try to stay below the amounts listed. Check the serving size and number of servi ngs. - The Nutrition Facts Label information is based on ONE serving, but many packages contain more. Look at the serving size and how many servings you are actually consuming. If you double the servings you eat, you double the calories and nutrients, incl uding the % DVs. - When you compare calories and nutrients between brands, check to see if the serving size is the same. Calories count, so pay attention to the amount. - Fat free doesn't mean calorie -free. Lower fat items may have as many calories as full -fat versions. - If the label lists that 1 serving equals 3 cookies and 100 calories, and you eat 6 cookies, you've eaten 2 servings or twice the calories and fat. This is where you'll find the number of calories per serving and the calories from fat in each serving. Know your fats and reduce sodium. - To help reduce your risk of heart disease, use the label to select foods that are lowest in saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol. - Trans fat doesn't have a % DV, but consume as little a s possible because it increases your risk of heart disease. - The % DV for total fat includes all different kinds of fats. - To help lower cholesterol, replace saturated and trans fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in fish, nuts and l iquid vegetable oil. - Limit sodium to help reduce your risk of high blood pressure. 5 Enjoy your food, but eat less. Take the time to fully enjoy your food as you 2 eat it. Eating too fast or when your attention is elsewhere may lead to eating too many calories. Pay attention to fullness cues before, during and after meals. Use them to recognize when to eat and when you've had enough. Balance Calories . Find out how many calories you need for a 1 day as a first step in managing your weight. Go to choosemyplate.gov to find your calorie level. Being physically active also helps you balance calories. Avoid oversized portions. Use a smaller plate, bowl and glass. Portion out 3 foods before you eat. When eating out, choose a smaller size option, share a dish, or take home part of a meal. Foods to eat more often: Eat more vegetables, fruits, whole grains and 4 fat-free or 1% milk and dairy products. These foods have the nutrients you need for health - including potassium, calcium, vitamin D, and fiber. Make them the basis for meals and snacks. chooseMyPlate 10 tips to a great plate Switch to fat free or low fat milk They have the same amount of calcium and 5 other essential nutrients as whole milk, but fewer calories and less saturated fat. Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. 6 Choose red, orange, and dark green vegetables like tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and broccoli, along with other vegetables for your meals. Add fruit to meals as part of main or side dishes or as a dessert. Foods to eat less often: Cut back on foods high in solid fats, added sugars and 7 salt. They include cakes, cookies, ice cream, candies, sweetened drinks, pizza, and fatty meats like ribs, sausages, bacon, and hot dogs. Use these foods as occasional treats, not everyday foods. Make half your grains whole grains To eat more whole grains, substitute a whole grain 8 product for a refined product, such as whole wheat bread instead of white bread, or brown rice instead of white rice. Compare sodium in foods. Use the Nutrition Facts label to be able to choose lo wer 9 lower sodium versions of foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals. Select canned foods labeled \"low sodium,\" \"reduced sodium,\" or \"no salt added.\" Drink water instead of sugary drinks. Cut calories by drinking unsweetened beverages. 10 Soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks are a major source of added sugars and calories. Making food choices for a healthy lifestyle can be as easy as using these 10 tips. Use the ideas in this list to balance your calories, to choose foods to eat more often, and to cut back on foods to eat less often. Chapter 8 Nutrition and Dietary Guidelines Vegetables Why is it important to eat vegetables? Eating vegetables provides health benefits - people who eat more vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. Vegetables provide nutrients vital for health and maintenance of your body. Nutrients Most vegetables are naturally low in fat and calories. None have cholesterol. (Sauces or seasonings may add fat, calories, or cholesterol.) Vegetables are important sources of many nutrients, including potassium, dietary fiber, folate (folic acid), vitamin A, a nd vitamin C. Diets rich in potassium may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Vegetable sources of potassium include sweet potatoes, white potatoes, white beans, tomato products (paste, sauce, and juice), beet greens, soybeans, lima beans, spinach, le ntils, and kidney beans. Dietary fiber from vegetables, as part of an overall healthy diet, helps reduce blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart disease. Fiber is important for proper bowel function. It helps reduce constipation and diverticul osis. Fiber - containing foods such as vegetables help provide a feeling of fullness with fewer calories. Folate (folic acid) helps the body form red blood cells. Women of childbearing age who may become pregnant should consume adequate folate from foods, an d in addition 400 mcg of synthetic folic acid from fortified foods or supplements. This reduces the risk of neural tube defects, spina bifida, and anencephaly during fetal development. Vitamin A keeps eyes and skin healthy and helps to protect against infe ctions. Vitamin C helps heal cuts and wounds and keeps teeth and gums healthy. Vitamin C aids in iron absorption. Health benefits Eating a diet rich in vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may reduce risk for heart disease, including heart attack and stroke. Eating a diet rich in some vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may protect against certain types of cancers. Diets rich in foods containing fiber, such as some vegetables and fruits, may reduce the risk of heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Eating vegetables and fruits rich in potassium as part of an overall healthy diet may lower blood pressure, and may also reduce the risk of developing kidney stones and help to decrease bone loss. Eating foods such a s vegetables that are lower in calories per cup instead of some other higher -calorie food may be useful in helping to lower calorie intake. Fruits Why is it important to eat fruit? Eating fruit provides health benefits \u2014 people who eat more fruits and veg etables as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. Fruits provide nutrients vital for hea lth and maintenance of your body. Nutrients Most fruits are naturally low in fat, sodium, and calories. None have cholesterol. Fruits are sources of many essential nutrients that are under -consumed, including potassium, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and folate (folic acid). Diets rich in potassium may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Fruit sources of potassium inc lude bananas, prunes and prune juice, dried peaches and apricots, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, and orange juice. Dietary fiber from fruits, as part of an overall healthy diet, helps reduce blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart disease. Fiber is important for proper bowel function. It helps reduce constipation and diverticulosis. Fiber - containing foods such as fruits help provide a feeling of fullness with fewer calories. Whole or cut -up fruits are sources of dietary fiber; fruit juices contain little or no fiber. Vitamin C is important for growth and repair of all body tissues, helps heal cuts and wounds, and keeps teeth and gums healthy. Folate (folic acid) helps the body form red blood cells. Women of childbearing age who may become pregnant should consume adequate folate from foods, and in addition 400 mcg of synthetic folic acid from fortified foods or supplements. This reduces the risk of neural tube defects, spina bifida, and anencephaly during fetal development. Health benefits Eating a d iet rich in vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may reduce risk for heart disease, including heart attack and stroke. Eating a diet rich in some vegetables and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet may protect against certain types of cancers. Diets rich in foods containing fiber, such as some vegetables and fruits, may reduce the risk of heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Eating vegetables and fruits rich in potassium as part of an overall healthy diet may lower blood pre ssure, and may also reduce the risk of developing kidney stones and help to decrease bone loss. Eating foods such as fruits that are lower in calories per cup instead of some other higher -calorie food may be useful in helping to lower calorie intake. Grai ns Why is it important to eat grains, especially whole grains? Eating grains, especially whole grains, provides health benefits. People who eat whole grains as part of a healthy diet have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. Grains provide many nutrients that are vital for the health and maintenance of our bodies. Nutrients Grains are important sources of many nutrients, including dietary fiber , several B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, ( iron, magnesium , and selenium). Dietary fiber from whole grains or other foods, may help reduce blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Fiber is important for proper bowel function. It helps reduce constipation and diverticulosis. Fiber -containing foods such as whole grains help provide a feeling of fullness with few er calories. The B vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin play a key role in metabolism - they help the body release energy from protein, fat, and carbohydrates. B vitamins are also essential for a healthy nervous system. Many refined grains are enriched with these B vitamins. Folate (folic acid), another B vitamin, helps the body form red blood cells. Women of childbearing age who may become pregnant should consume adequate folate from foods, and in addition 400 mcg of synthetic folic acid from fortified foods or supplements. This reduces the risk of neural tube defects, spina bifida, and anencephaly during fetal development. Iron is used to carry oxygen in the blood. Many teenage girls and women in their childbearing years have iron - deficiency anemia. Th ey should eat foods high in heme -iron (meats) or eat other iron containing foods along with foods rich in vitamin C, which can improve absorption of non- heme iron. Whole and enriched refined grain products are major sources of non -heme iron in American diets. Whole grains are sources of magnesium and selenium. Magnesium is a mineral used in building bones and releasing energy from muscles. Selenium protects cells from oxidation. It is also important for a healthy immune system. Health benefits Consuming whole grains as part of a healthy diet may reduce the risk of heart disease. Consuming foods containing fiber, such as whole grains, as part of a healthy diet, may reduce constipation. Eating whole grains may help with weight management. Eating grain products fortified with folate before and during pregnancy helps prevent neural tube defects during fetal development. Proteins Why is it important to make lean or low -fat choices from the Protein Foods Group? Foods in the meat, poultry, fish, eggs, nuts, and seed group provide nutrients that are vital for health and maintenance of your body. However, choosing foods from this group that are high in saturated fat and cho lesterol may have health implications. Nutrients Diets that are high in saturated fats raise \"bad\" cholesterol levels in the blood. The \"bad\" cholesterol is called LDL (low -density lipoprotein) cholesterol. High LDL cholesterol, in turn, increases the ri sk for coronary heart disease. Some food choices in this group are high in saturated fat. These include fatty cuts of beef, pork, and lamb; regular (75% to 85% lean) ground beef; regular sausages, hot dogs, and bacon; some luncheon meats such as regular bo logna and salami; and some poultry such as duck. To help keep blood cholesterol levels healthy, limit the amount of these foods you eat. Diets that are high in cholesterol can raise LDL cholesterol levels in the blood. Cholesterol is only found in foods from animal sources. Some foods from this group are high in cholesterol. These include egg yolks (egg whites are cholesterol -free) and organ meats such as liver and giblets. To help keep blood cholesterol levels healthy, limit the amount of these foods you eat. Why is it important to eat 8 ounces of seafood per week? Seafood contains a range of nutrients, notably the omega- 3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. Eating about 8 ounces per week of a variety of seafood contributes to the prevention of heart disease. Smaller amounts of seafood are recommended for young children. Seafood varieties that are commonly consumed in the United States that are higher in EPA and DHA and lower in mercury include salmon, anchovies, herring, sardines, Pacific oysters, trout, and A tlantic and Pacific. The health benefits from consuming seafood outweigh the health risk associated with mercury, a heavy metal found in seafood in varying levels. Health benefits Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans and peas, eggs, nuts, and seeds supply many nutrients. These include protein, B vitamins (niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and B6), vitamin E, iron, zinc, and magnesium. Proteins function as building blocks for bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood. They are also building blocks for enzymes, horm ones, and vitamins. Proteins are one of three nutrients that provide calories (the others are fat and carbohydrates). B vitamins serve a variety of functions in the body. They help the body release energy, play a vital role in the function of the nervous s ystem, aid in the formation of red blood cells, and help build tissues. Iron is used to carry oxygen in the blood. Many teenage girls and women in their child- bearing years have iron - deficiency anemia. They should eat foods high in heme -iron (meats) or eat other non -heme iron containing foods along with a food rich in vitamin C, which can improve absorption of non- heme iron. Magnesium is used in building bones and in releasing energy from muscles. Zinc is necessary for biochemical reactions and helps the im mune system function properly. EPA and DHA are omega -3 fatty acids found in varying amounts in seafood. Eating 8 ounces per week of seafood may help reduce the risk for heart disease. What are the benefits of eating nuts and seeds? Eating peanuts and certain tree nuts (i.e., walnuts, almonds, and pistachios) may reduce the risk of heart disease when consumed as part of a diet that is nutritionally adequate and within calorie needs. Because nuts and seeds are high in calori es, eat them in small portions and use them to replace other protein foods, like some meat or poultry, rather than adding them to what you already eat. In addition, choose unsalted nuts and seeds to help reduce sodium intakes. Dairy Why is Dairy important? Consuming dairy products pro vides health benefits \u2014 especially improved bone health. Foods in the Dairy Group provide nutrients that are vital for health and maintenance of your body. These nutrients include calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein. Why is it important to make fat -free or low -fat choices from the Dairy Group? Choosing foods from the Dairy Group that are high in saturated fats and cholesterol can have health implications. Diets high in saturated fats raise \"bad\" cholesterol levels in the blood. The \"bad\" cholesterol is called LDL (low -density lipoprotein) cholesterol. High LDL cholesterol, in turn, increases the risk for coronary heart disease. Many cheeses, whole milk, and products made from them are high in saturated fat. To help kee p blood cholesterol levels healthy, limit the amount of these foods you eat. In addition, a high intake of fats makes it difficult to avoid consuming more calories than are needed. Nutrients Calcium is used for building bones and teeth and in maintaining bone mass. Dairy products are the primary source of calcium in American diets. Diets that provide 3 cups or the equivalent of dairy products per day can improve bone mass. Diets rich in potassium may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Dairy products , especially yogurt, fluid milk, and soymilk (soy beverage), provide potassium. Vitamin D functions in the body to maintain proper levels of calcium and phosphorous, thereby helping to build and maintain bones. Milk and soymilk (soy beverage) that are for tified with vitamin D are good sources of this nutrient. Other sources include vitamin D- fortified yogurt and vitamin D -fortified ready -to-eat breakfast cereals. Milk products that are consumed in their low -fat or fat -free forms provide little or no solid fat. Health Benefits Intake of dairy products is linked to improved bone health, and may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. The intake of dairy products is especially important to bone health during childhood and adolescence, when bone mass is being built. Intake of dairy products is also associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and with lower blood pressure in adults. Why is it important to consume fats and oils? Oils are not a food group, but they do provide essential nutrients and are therefore included in USDA recommendations for what to eat. Note that only small amounts of oils are recommended. Most of the fats you eat should be polyunsaturated (PUFA) or monounsaturated (MUFA) fats. Oils are the major source of MUFAs and PUFAs in the diet. PUFAs contain some fatty acids that are necessary for health - called \"essential fatty acids.\" Because oils contain these essential fatty acids, there is an allowan ce for oils in the food guide. The MUFAs and PUFAs found in fish, nuts, and vegetable oils do not raise LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels in the blood. In addition to the essential fatty aci ds they contain, oils are the major source of vitamin E in typical American diets. While consuming some oil is needed for health, oils still contain calories. In fact, oils and solid fats both contain about 120 calories per tablespoon. Therefore, the amoun t of oil consumed needs to be limited to balance total calorie intake. The Nutrition Facts label provides information to help you make smart choices. Cooking Safety Why it matters Did you know that the bacteria that cause food poisoning multiply quickest in the \"Danger Zone\" between 40 and 140 Fahrenheit? And while many people think they can tell when food is \"done\" simply by checking its color and texture, there's no way to be sure it's safe without following a few important but simple steps Use a food thermometer. Cooked food is safe only after it's been heated to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria. Color and texture alone won't tell you whether your food is done. Instead, use a food thermometer to be sure. If you don't alread y have one, consider buying a food thermometer. Learn more about the different types of food thermometers available. When you think your food is done, place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food, making sure not to touch bone, fat, or gristle. ( Get tips on correct thermometer placement .) Wait the amount of time recommended for your type of thermometer. Compare your thermometer reading to our Minimum Cooking Temperatures Chart to be sure it's reached a safe temperature. Some foods need 3 minutes of rest time after cooking to make sure that harmful germs are killed. Check our Minimum Cooking Temperatures Chart for details. Clean your food thermometer with hot, soapy wat er after each use. Keep food hot after cooking (at 140 F or above). The possibility of bacterial growth actually increases as food cools after cooking because the drop in temperature allows bacteria to thrive. But you can keep your food above the safe te mperature of 140F by using a heat source like a chafing dish, warming tray, or slow cooker. Microwave food thoroughly (to 165 F). To ensure harmful bacteria have been killed in your foods, it's important to microwave them to 165 or higher. Here's how: When you microwave, stir your food in the middle of heating. If the food label says, \"Let stand for x minutes after cooking,\" don't skimp on the standing time. Letting your microwaved food sit for a few minutes actually helps your food cook more completely by allowing colder areas of food time to absorb heat from hotter areas of food. That extra minute or two could mean the difference between a delicious meal and food poisoning. After waiting a few minutes, check the food with a food thermometer to make sur e it is 165F or above. Safe Minimum Cooking Temperatures Use this chart and a food thermometer to ensure that meat, poultry, seafood, and other cooked foods reach a safe minimum internal temperature. Remember, you can't tell whether meat is safely cooked by looking at it. Any cooked, uncured red meats - including pork - can be pink, even when the meat has reached a safe internal temperature. Why the Rest Time is Important After you remove meat from a grill, oven, or other heat source, allow it to rest for the specified amount of time. During the rest time, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise , which destroys harmful germs. Safe Cooking Temperatures Category Food Temperature (\u00b0F) Rest Time Ground Meat & Meat Mixtures Beef, Pork, Veal, Lamb 160 None Turkey, Chicken 165 None Fresh Beef, Veal, Lamb Steaks, roasts, chops 145 3 minutes Poultry Chicken & Turkey, whole 165 None Poultry breasts, roasts 165 None Poultry thighs, legs, wings 165 None Duck & Goose 165 None Stuffing (cooked alone or in bird) 165 None Pork and Ham Fresh pork 145 3 minutes Fresh ham (raw) 145 3 minutes Precooked ham (to reheat) 140 None Eggs & Egg Dishes Eggs Cook until yolk and white are firm None Egg dishes 160 None Leftovers & Casseroles Leftovers 165 None Casseroles 165 None Seafood Fin Fish 145 or cook until flesh is opaque and separates easily with a fork. None Shrimp, lobster, and crabs Cook until flesh is pearly and opaque. None Clams, oysters, and mussels Cook until shells open during cooking. None Scallops Cook until flesh is milky white or opaque and firm. None Refrigeration Safety Refrigerate promptly Did you know that illness -causing bacteria can grow in perishable foods within two hours unless you refrigerate them? (And if the temperature is 90 F or higher during the summer, cut that time down to one hour!) But by refrigerating foods promptly and properly, you can help keep your family safe from food poisoning at home. Refrigerate perishable foods within two hours. Cold temperatures slow the growth of illness causing bacteria. So it's important to chill food promptly and properly. Here's how: Make sure your fridge and freezer are cooled to the right temperature. Your fridge should be between 40 F and 32 F, a nd your freezer should be 0 F or below. Pack your refrigerator with care. To properly chill food (and slow bacteria growth), cold air must be allowed to circulate in your fridge. For this reason, it's important not to over -stuff your fridge. Get perishabl e foods into the fridge or freezer within two hours. In the summer months, cut this time down to one hour. Remember to store leftovers within two hours as well. By dividing leftovers into several clean, shallow containers, you'll allow them to chill faster . Never thaw or marinate foods on the counter. Many people are surprised at this tip. But since bacteria can multiply rapidly at room temperature, thawing or marinating foods on the counter is one of the riskiest things you can do when preparing food for your family. To thaw food safely, choose one of these options: Thaw in the refrigerator. This is the safest way to thaw meat, poultry, and seafood. Simply take the food out of the freezer and place it on a plate or pan that can catch any juices that may le ak. Normally, it should be ready to use the next day. Thaw in cold water. For faster thawing, you can put the frozen package in a watertight plastic bag and submerge it in cold water. Be sure to change the water every 30 minutes. Note: If you thaw this way, be sure to cook the food immediately. Thaw in the microwave. Faster thawing can also be accomplished in the microwave. Simply follow instructions in your owner's manual for thawing. As with thawing in cold water, food thawed in the microwave should be cooked immediately. Cook without thawing. If you don't have enough time to thaw food, just remember, it is safe to cook foods from a frozen state \u2014but your cooking time will be approximately 50% longer than fully thawed meat or poultry. To marinate food safely, always marinate it in the refrigerator . Know when to throw food out. You can't tell just by looking or smelling whether harmful bacteria has started growing in your leftovers or refrigerated foo ds. Be sure you throw food out before harmful bacteria grow. Storage Times for the Refrigerator and Freezer These short but safe time limits for home- refrigerated foods will keep them from spoiling or becoming dangerous to eat. The guidelines for freezer storage are for quality only. Frozen foods remain safe indefinitely. Storage Times Category Food Refrigerator (40 \u00b0F or below) Freezer (0 \u00b0F or below) Salads Egg, chicken, ham, tuna & macaroni salads 3 to 5 days Does not freeze well Hot dogs opened package 1 week 1 to 2 months unopened package 2 weeks 1 to 2 months Luncheon meat opened package or deli sliced 3 to 5 days 1 to 2 months unopened package 2 weeks 1 to 2 months Bacon & Sausage Bacon 7 days 1 month Sausage, raw \u2014 from chicken, turkey, pork, beef 1 to 2 days 1 to 2 months Hamburger & Other Ground Meats Hamburger, ground beef, turkey, veal, pork, lamb, & mixtures of them 1 to 2 days 3 to 4 months Fresh Beef, Veal, Lamb & Pork Steaks 3 to 5 days 6 to 12 months Chops 3 to 5 days 4 to 6 months Roasts 3 to 5 days 4 to 12 months Fresh Poultry Chicken or turkey, whole 1 to 2 days 1 year Chicken or turkey, pieces 1 to 2 days 9 months Soups & Stews Vegetable or meat added 3 to 4 days 2 to 3 months Leftovers Cooked meat or poultry 3 to 4 days 2 to 6 months Chicken nuggets or patties 3 to 4 days 1 to 3 months Pizza 3 to 4 days 1 to 2 months Separation Safety Don't cross -contaminate. Why it matters Even after you've cleaned your hands and surfaces thoroughly, raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs can still spread illness - causing bacteria to ready -to-eat foods \u2014unless you keep them separate. But which foods need to be kept separate, and how? Follow these top tips to keep your family safe Use separate cutting boards and plates for produce and for meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs. Placing ready -to-eat food on a surface that held raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs can spread bacteria and make you sick. But stopping cross -contamination is simple. Use one cutting board for fresh produce, and one for raw meat, poultry, or seafood. Use separate plates and utensils for cooked and raw foods. Before using them again, thor oughly wash plates, utensils, and cutting boards that held raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs. Once a cutting board gets excessively worn or develops hard -to-clean grooves, consider replacing it. Keep meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs separate from all ot her foods at the grocery. Make sure you aren't contaminating foods in your grocery bag by: Separating raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs from other foods in your shopping cart. At the checkout, place raw meat, poultry, and seafood in plastic bags to keep their juices from dripping on other foods. Keep meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs separate from all other foods in the fridge. Bacteria can spread inside your fridge if the juices of raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs drip onto ready- to-eat foods. But stopping this contamination is simple... Place raw meat, poultry, and seafood in containers or sealed plastic bags to prevent their juices from dripping or leaking onto other foods. If you're not planning to use these foods within a few days, freeze the m instead. Keep eggs in their original carton and store them in the main compartment of the refrigerator \u2014not in the door. Cleaning Safety Wash hands and surfaces often. Why it matters Illness -causing bacteria can survive in many places around your kitchen, including your hands, utensils, and cutting boards. Unless you wash your hands, utensils, and surfaces the right way, you could spread bacteria to your food, and your family. Wash hands the right way \u2014for 20 seconds with soap and running water. Was hing your hands the right way can stop the spread of illness -causing bacteria. Here's how to do it: Wet your hands with warm or cold running water and apply soap. Rub your hands together to make a lather and scrub them well. Be sure to scrub the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. Bacteria can hide out here too! Continue rubbing hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum \"Happy Birthday\" from beginning to end twice. Rinse your hands well under running water. Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry. And when to do it: Before eating food. Before, during, and after preparing food. Before and after treating a cut or wound. Before and after caring for someone who is sick. After handling uncooked eggs, or raw meat, poultry, seafood, or their juices. After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. After touching an animal or animal waste. After touching garbage. After using the toilet. Wash surfaces and utensils after each use. Bacteria can be spread throughout the kitchen and get onto cutting boards, utensils, and counter tops. To prevent: Use paper towels or clean cloths to wipe up kitchen surfaces or spills. Wash cloths often in the hot cycle of your washing machine. Wash cutting boards, dishes, utensils, and counter tops w ith hot, soapy water after preparing each food item and before you go on to the next item. As an extra precaution, you can use a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach in 1 gallon of water to sanitize washed surfaces and utensils. Wash fruits and veggies \u2014but not meat, poultry, or eggs! Did you know that even if you plan to peel fruits and veggies, it's important to wash them first because bacteria can spread from the outside to the inside as you cut or peel them? Here's how to wash your produce: 1. Cut away any damaged or bruised areas. 2. Rinse produce under running water. Don't use soap, detergent, bleach, or commercial produce washes. 3. Scrub firm produce \u2014like melons or cucumbers \u2014with a clean produce brush. 4. Dry produce with a paper towel or clean cloth towel... and you're done. 5. The good news? Bagged produce marked \"pre -washed\" is safe to use without further washing. Why not wash meat, poultry, and eggs? Washing raw meat and poultry can actually help bacteria spread, because their juices may splash onto (and contaminate!) your sink and countertops. All commercial eggs are washed before sale. Any extra handling of the eggs, such as washing, may actually increase the risk of cross -contamination, especially if the shell becomes cracked.

The individuals you support rely on you to be a good detective; to identify changes that may be signs & symptoms of an illness, injury, or age - related conditions; and to ensure they receive appropriate treatment. Ask questions to determine changes in: daily routine behavior ways of communicating appearance general manner or mood physical health Documentation Guidelines and Examples Guidelines and examples when reporting and documenting changes that may be signs or symptoms of illness or injury: Do not document your opinion. For example, do not write: \"Bill said his arm hurt, but I don't think there is anything really wrong.\" Be specific when reporting and documenting observed changes. For example: \"I heard Jane screaming. She was sitting on the couch in the living room. The screaming lasted for about two minutes.\" Report and document both the question and the response. For example: \"Bill said, 'My stoma ch hurts.' I long has it hurt?' Bill said, 'Since breakfast, and it really hurts bad.'\" In the case where an individual does not verbally respond, you should report and document the individual's response. For example: \"I heard Jane screamin g. When I asked Jane, 'What's wrong?' she put her hands on her head and began rocking.\" Write down what the individual said or did to communicate the change. For example: \"Bill said, 'My stomach hurts.'\" \"Fred walked up to me and pointed to his stomach, frowning and moaning.\" Do not try to make a diagnosis. You are not a health care professional. Describe identified changes only. Date of Entry Time of Entry Topic Entry Record issue, action taken, results seen, or follow -up needed.

NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS www.na.org Seattle seattlena.org 206- Healthcare and Healthcare Management Reporting and Documenting Changes Regardless of what action you take when you notice a change, you must report (tell it) and document (write about it) in some way. Medical emergencies that involve emergency medical personnel must be: 1) documented in the individual's record; and, 2) submitted in an incident worksheet repor t per your agency's policies. Any call to the health care professional must be documented in the individual's record. Any treatment provided in accordance with a written health care professional's order or simple First Aid must also be documented in the individual's record. Sometimes the correct response is simply to document the change that you have identified. This is important as you and other DSP staff may identify a pattern or trend over time, and provide valuable information in the diagnosing of a health problem. For example: through continuous documentation of your observations, you may discover that an individual is losing interest in activities, which may be a sign or symptom of illness or injury. Many changes occur slowly over time and will onl y be identified if you and other DSP staff consistently document and share observations. You may be reporting changes (or signs and symptoms) to a number of different people, including a health care professional, dentist, behavior specialist, and your supe rvisor. All of these contacts must be documented. If you believe that signs and symptoms may be an indication of possible abuse or neglect, you are mandated to report to the appropriate protective service agency. Always report and document changes as soo n as possible. Follow your agency's procedure for notifying your supervisor. Making the Most of Health Care Professional Visits Here are some tips to assist you and the individual you support to prepare for a visit to the health care professional or oth er professionals, and to make the most of your time together: It is important the individual be accompanied by a staff they are familiar with if at all possible. Staff accompanying needs to be familiar with the individual and their overall health needs. Ensure transportation is arranged. Check with health care professional to be sure they are willing and able to provide any special accommodations needed in the office, including in the waiting room. If the person has trouble waiting, ask if there is anything they can do to expedite the visit. If helpful, bring items to occupy the individual. Bring good complete records with you to the appointment. Be sure to include: the person's insurance card, list of current medication and medication history, forms for the doctor to complete, family/guardian information, name location and phone of pharmacy, directions to the appointment Talk with the individual and others involved in his or her health care to identify and health concerns. Do this prior to the visit. Bring a written list of any concerns and questions you and/or the individual may have. Try to limit the list to the top three concerns. Assist with the individual practice asking questions before the visit. Make sure the questions get asked, either by you or t he individual. Play an active role in the visit maintaining a positive, supportive environment. Make sure you understand what the health care professional is saying, and don't be afraid to ask for clarification. Ask any questions you have about diet, exerc ise, or smoking. Ask about treatment options. Bring a written list of all the medications the individual is taking. When the health care professional writes a prescription, ask questions about the medication, side effects and contraindications. Ask about n ext steps in treatment, and be sure you understand the expected results of the treatment and what the health care professional wants done. Support the individual to participate as fully as possible in the appointment. Always arrive early or on time for eac h appointment. If you cannot get there, call well in advance and reschedule. Document the outcome of the appointment in the individual's record in accordance with your agency's policies. It is important all staff working with the individual know the result s of the appointment so their support is designed around the information. Personal Health Advocacy With busy health care professionals who have limited time to spend with patients, personal health advocacy is often needed if those in your care are to receive the best possible health services. An additional reason for health advocacy is that, historically, the general population has often devalued people with disabilities. Here are some things you can do to be a health care advocate: Believe every person is entitled to quality care. Be persistent in getting the care the person needs. It's never too early or too late to provide the best possible care. Be an active partner or get the assistance of someone who can help. Don't be afraid to ask for help (inform ation, advice, assistance.) Be prepared for the appointment, and tell the health care professional the reason for the appointment early in the appointment. Choose a health care professional with a good reputation, ideally one who has hospital privileges at the community hospital. Advocating for the best possible health care often means working in partnership with health care professionals and other professionals. Most health care professionals want their patients (and those who assist their patients) to be active partners, providing information, asking questions, discussing and weighing options, and checking for understanding. Working in partnership with health care professionals calls for the following: A common goal (good quality care) A shared effort (each one doing the right thing) Good communication Such an approach makes better use of the health care professional's time and can improve the quality of care. Germs Everyone comes in contact with millions of germs (microorganisms) each day. Germs need warmth, moisture, darkness and oxygen to live and grow. Many germs are harmless and are needed for our bodies to function in a healthy way. For example, certain kinds of germs or bacteria are needed for the digestion of food and for the elimination of wast e products (feces and urine) from our bodies. Some germs are very harmful and cause infections, diseases, and illnesses by rapidly multiplying and overwhelming the body's natural defenses. An infection can be local in one spot, such as an infected cut, or it can be systemic (throughout the whole body), such as food poisoning or pneumonia. Three Ways Germs Are Spread Germs are spread in the environment three ways: direct contact, indirect contact, and droplet spread. 1. Direct Contact. This refers to germs spread from one infected person to another. An example of direct contact is when the person infected with a cold puts his hands to his mouth while coughing or sneezing and then touches or contacts another person before he has washed his hands. 2. Indirect Contact. This refers to germs spread from one infected person to an object to another person. The germ from the infected person contaminates the object, and the next person who touches the object is then contaminated. Indirect contact is a common way for g erms to spread between people who live, work, and play together. The spread of germs through indirect contact can happen when eating contaminated food (E. coli, Salmonella); handling soiled linens and soiled equipment; using soiled utensils and cups; and drinking or using contaminated water. 3. Droplet Spread. This refers to germs spread through the air from one infected person to another person. The germs are airborne and are carried over short distances. When people talk, cough, or sneeze, they are spreading germs through the air. The germs of the common cold, flu, and tuberculosis travel from one person to another by droplet spread. Knowing how germs are spread is the first step in practicing infection control and preventing illness. Knowing how to contr ol the spread of germs is the second step . You can protect yourself and the individuals you support from germs or contamination by observing the following: Know and practice universal precautions, especially hand washing and gloving. Keep you, the indivi dual, and the environment clean. Be aware of the signs and symptoms of illness and infection and accurately record and report them to the health care professional. IDENTIFYING AND PREVENTING HIGH- RISK HEALTH PROBLEMS Skin Breakdown and Other Skin Conditio ns Skin breakdown is a serious and constant concern for individuals who use wheelchairs and/or who do not change positions. Pressure sores are skin breakdown over bony spots such as tailbone and hips. Individuals who use wheelchairs and/or people with mobility challenges are at high risk for skin breakdown. Reference your agency policies or protocols for individuals who are at risk. Ways to prevent skin breakdown: Frequently moving and/or changing positions Keeping the skin dry and clean What to do if sk in breakdown occurs: Make sure the individual is examined by a health care professional immediately. Athlete's foot ( tinea pedia) and ) are very common fungal infections that can cause skin breakdown. Like bacteria, fungi grow best in warm, moist areas of the skin, such as between the toes or in the groin. Fungus problems can be prevented by thorough drying of skin; wearing sandals or shoes that breathe; wearing cotton underclothes and socks; and using talcum powder. You should assis t individuals with cleaning and drying both areas of the toes and groin. Some skin problems are very serious. Others are uncomfortable and passing. Some skin problems can be prevented or at least minimized through diet, proper clothing, and other actions. Some skin problems may be spread by contact, so remember to use hand washing and other infection control techniques. Always seek advice and treatment from the individual's health care professional when new problems arise or the existing problem continues. Constipation Each individual has a pattern of bowel movements that are \"normal\" for him. Once the normal pattern of bowel movements is established, you should look for any indication of a change. When an individual is not able to tell you that he had a b owel movement, or the health care professional has determined that the individual is at risk for problems in this area, the plan for that individual may include keeping a record of bowel movements. Changes that are often signs and symptoms of constipation: A change in the normal pattern of bowel movements (smaller amounts of stool, watery stool or diarrhea, unusual accidents) Loss of appetite Increase in sleepiness and fussiness Abdominal bloating Persistent abdominal pain Change in behavior Individuals w ho are at a higher risk for constipation include persons who: Have mobility challenges Get very little regular exercise Do not drink enough fluids Do not eat enough fiber Take medications whose side effects include constipation Ways to prevent constipation: Eating a healthy diet with lots of fiber (fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) Exercising regularly Drinking plenty of fluids, especially water Untreated constipation can lead to serious consequences, including: the need for surgical remova l of the impacted fecal matter; rupture of the bowel; and even death. If you identify any of these signs, call the individual's health care professio nal to seek medical assistance. Sun and Heat -Related Illnesses Overexposure to sun and heat can cause many problems \u2014from mild sunburn to fatal sunstroke. Individuals are at risk of heat -related illness starting at temperatures as low as 80 degrees, depending upon length of exposure and level of physically activity. It is your responsibility to protect each individual from sunburn, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Risk factors for sun and heat -related illnesses In general, children, the elderly, and individuals with developmental disabilities are at the greatest risk for sunburn and heat -related i llness. Increased risk is also associated with taking certain medications and having certain characteristics, including but not limited to: Antihistamines used in cold and allergy medications Antibiotics (sulfa drugs, tetracycline) Antidepressants Antipsyc hotics Cardiovascular drugs Oral medications for diabetes Non -steroidal, anti -inflammatory drugs used to control pain and inflammation Anti- dandruff shampoos Fair hair or skin Low fluid intake Low fiber diet Medications that interfere with the body's ability to regulate its temperature Ways to prevent sunburn and heat -related illness To prevent sunburn, use sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or more. Individuals with fair hair or skin who burn easily should use a sunscreen with SPF 30. Apply sunscreen to all exposed skin surfaces 20 minutes prior to going out in the sun. Reapply throughout the day and after the skin comes in contact with water. Use of sunscreen should be documented in the individual's record. When temperatures rise, make sure the individuals you are supporting observe the following precautions: Wear a hat with a wide brim and lightweight and light colored clothing or use an umbrella. Wear long -sleeved, light cotton clothing. Drink plenty of water each day. Drink even more if the individual is working or exercising in hot weather. Avoid caffeinated or alcoholic beverages. Take it easy! Limit physical activity during the hottest parts of the day. Stay inside if possible during extreme heat times. Assess the person's home for adequate ventilation . If the home cannot be cooled to the point that it will be safe for the individuals, contact your supervisor. If you must be outdoors for long periods of time, stay in a shady spot or bring a sunshade with you. For individuals with impaired movement, avoi d temperatures above 95 degrees if at all possible. In the event of a power outage, consider going to a cool building or air -conditioned car. Never leave a child, an individual with a disability, or someone who cannot exit on his own, in a car on a hot day. In as little as 10 minutes, the car can become a fatal furnace. Sunburn is caused by exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays. An individual can burn within 15 minutes any day of the year. Sunburns can occur even on an overcast day. People of color can a lso burn very easily. The degree to which someone burns or tans depends on the intensity of the sun's rays and the individual's unique response to the exposure. Typical symptoms of sunburn are redness and pain in the skin. In severe cases there is also swelling, blisters, fever, and headaches. In addition to sunburn, individuals with frequent exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays have a high risk of developing skin cancer. Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. Sleep Apnea Obstructive sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. Several types of sleep apnea exist, but the most common type is obstructive sleep apnea, which occurs when your throat muscles inte rmittently relax and block your airway during sleep. The most noticeable sign of obstructive sleep apnea is snoring, although not everyone who has obstructive sleep apnea snores. Anyone can develop obstructive sleep apnea, although it most commonly affect s older adults. It's also especially common in people who are overweight. Obstructive sleep apnea treatment may involve using a device to keep your airway open or undergoing a procedure to remove tissue from your nose, mouth or throat. Signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include: Excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia) Loud snoring Observed episodes of breathing cessation during sleep Abrupt awakenings accompanied by shortness of breath Awakening with a dry mouth or sore throat Morning headache Frequent urination at night Difficulty staying asleep (insomnia) When to see a doctor: consult a medical professional if you experience, or if someone observes the following: Snoring loud enough to disturb your sleep or that of others Shortness of Breat h that awakens you from sleep Intermittent pauses in your breathing during sleep Excessive daytime drowsiness, which may cause you to fall asleep while you're working, watching television or even driving a vehicle Choking Choking is a blockage of the airway that prevents an individual from breathing. Choking will result in death unless the airway is cleared immediately. Many individuals with developmental disabilities or a chronic health condition may experience choking episodes. Common risk factors in clude the following conditions and situations: Cerebral palsy, which is often associated with difficulty chewing and/or swallowing. Individuals who have difficulty chewing and or swallowing. They need close observation when eating and drinking to help avoi d choking incidents. Individuals with other conditions who have trouble with foods of different textures. Individuals taking certain medications. They may have dry mouth, which makes it harder to swallow. Choking is common for individuals who eat or drink too fast. Individuals should be reminded not to talk or laugh with food in their mouths or eat lying down. Individuals who frequently put too much food in their mouths may need to be cued to eat smaller bites or be provided with smaller amounts of food. I t is especially important to closely monitor an individual who takes food from others, as the individual may put too much food in their mouth to avoid being caught. Common Causes of Choking: Trying to swallow large portions of poorly chewed food Eating wh ile talking excitedly or laughing Eating too fast Eating and walking, playing, or running with food or objects in the mouth Eating certain foods like hot dogs, whole grapes, and hard candies Taking medications that decrease alertness and muscle tone or cau se dry mouth Poor oral motor skills Difficulty swallowing Eating foreign objects Vomiting Aspiration (inhaling vomit, saliva, food, or a foreign object) Signs of Choking: Clutching the throat with one or both hands Inability to speak, cough forcefully, or breathe Turning blue in the face High -pitched wheeze Aspiration occurs when food (liquids, saliva or other items) enters into the person's airway (either going into the lungs instead of the stomach, or by moving back up through the esophagus from the sto mach). Most people cough up food or drink, but some people cannot, due to the following conditions and habits: Missing teeth Seizures Lack of awareness Fatigue Medication side effects Poor muscle function Poor eating habits such as stuffing or rapid eatin g Some medical conditions Poor posture when eating The aging process Aspiration can be life threatening and may result in: Damaged lungs that can become infected (the more frequent the aspiration, the more damage that may occur) Life-threatening pneumonia Infection spreading to the blood stream and other areas of the body Shock If you observe the following activities or signs in the person you are supporting, s/he may be at risk aspiration or have aspirated: Coughing before swallowing Excessive drooling, e specially during meals Pocketing food inside the cheek Choking on soft foods such as white bread or harder foods not cut into small enough pieces, or taking big bites Talking while eating, not paying attention Runny nose or sneezing during eating time Trou ble swallowing certain types of fluids or foods A gurgling voice during or after eating or drinking Repeated episodes of choking, frequent colds, a history of pneumonia or allergies If an individual appears to be at risk for aspiration: Document what you see. Tell other staff about your concerns. Tell your supervisor what you see. Offer foods that the person seems to swallow easily. Have the person eat at a slower pace. Stop the meal if the person is having difficulty. Tell the health care professional what you see. If an individual has aspirated, an infection may develop in the lungs. Look for signs of infection, document and report to the individual's health care professional and your supervisor. Call 9- 1-1 if the person is blue, having difficulty breathing or looks very ill. Eating The following are general tips when assisting an individual to eat: Never feed an individual who is lying down, reclining, or very sleepy. Make sure the individual's head is forward and his/her chin is down. Put a small amo unt of food on the spoon or fork. Give the individual plenty of time for chewing and swallowing. Never rush. Tell the individual what food is on the fork or spoon before putting it in his/her mouth. Treat the individual as an adult not a child. Encourage t he individual to remain upright for at least 20 - 30 minutes after finishing a meal. Individuals who have difficulty with eating Difficulty chewing Chewing problems can be due to dentures or other mouth pain. Encourage an individual to visit his/her dentist since many problems are treatable. Encourage an individual to try cooking all foods until soft and tender; cutting food into small bites and eating slowly. Serve: fruit and vegetable juices; soft canned fruit; creamed and mashed vegetables; substituting ground or finely cut meats in place of whole meats; eggs, yogurt, puddings and soup (never use raw eggs); cooked cereals, rice, bread pudding and soft cookies; foods with sauces to make them moist and easy to chew. No appetite An individual may not feel like eating due to a reduced ability to taste and smell, medications, depression, denture pain, or constipation. Encourage the individual to try: talking with his/her doctor; eating 4- 6 smaller meals during the day; increasing his/her activity level (if able); choosing healthy, high calorie, high protein foods or adding nutritionally balanced drinks; eating the biggest meal when his/her appetite is best; adding more spices and/or herbs to food to increase the flavor. Dysphagia Food Preparation: Foods that are difficult for individuals with dysphagia to eat include: Foods that fall apart Bulky or sticky foods Dry bread; crackers Fresh white bread Chips and nuts Peanut butter Thin, pureed applesauce Plain mashed potatoes Plain rice Bananas Thin, hot cereal Refried beans Plain ground meats Bran cereals Cooked peas or corn Chunks of plain meat Raw vegetables and some fruits Foods can be thickened or thinned to individual requirements. Many foods can be used to change a liquid to a different consistency. The amount of thickening agent needed to reach a certain food consistency varies depending on the food being thickened and on the thickening agent used. To Thicken Foods Add: To Thin Foods Add : Baby cereal Broth Bread crumbs Bouillon Cornstarch Gravy Cooked cereals (cream of wheat or rice) Juice Custard mix Liquid flavored gelatin Graham cracker crumbs Melted hot butter/margarine Gravy Milk (hot or cold) Mashed potatoes/instant potato flakes Plain yogurt Plain unflavored gelatin powder Strained pureed soups Baby foods: fruits, meats, vegetables Saltine cracker crumbs Plain sauces (white, cheese, tomato) Tips to make foods easier to chew and swallow: To avoid forming a hard crust on the top of a food or around the edges, cook the food in a covered casserole dish. To make soft scrambled eggs, cook the eggs in the top of a double boiler. To keep meat or fish moist, cook in tomato juice or tomato soup. To make pureed meat, first drain soft, cooked meat. Place meat in a food processor or blender to make a paste. Add hot liquid (broth) to the paste and thin to desired consistency. General tips when assisting an individual with dysphagia to eat: Let the person see, smell, and taste the food to encourage saliva to flow and to improve his/her appetite before he/she starts eating. Avoid having the individual talk while eating. Place food in the middle of the front third of the tongue, and push the tongue down (this stops the tongue falling back into the mout h and getting in the way of the swallow). Watch for pocketing of food. If this happens, remove the pocketed food and have individual slow down or ask the individual to do a \"tongue sweep\" if he/she is able. You may need to prompt the swallowing process wit h statements like \"chew thoroughly\", \"swallow again\", \"hold your breath while \"clear your throat\". How blood borne pathogens are spread in the workplace Can be spread by: CAN NOT be spread by A needle stick or other puncture wound Helping a person who is bleeding Changing lines that are contaminated by blood or other body fluids Helping to clean up blood, vomit, urine or feces Changing a dressing or bandage with blood that has oozed from the wound Contact with broken skin (chapped, weeping, or dermatitis) Contact with mucous membranes (mouth, nose and eyes) Providing care for a person with a blood borne pathogens disease when standard precautions are used Sharing eating utensils, plates or glasses Sharing bathrooms Through the air Hugging shaking or holding hands Exposure to blood borne diseases Kind of exposure What to do Your eyes are splattered with blood or body fluids Flush immediately with water for at least 5 minutes. Rise under clean running water. Blood or any body fluids get into your mouth . Rinse your mouth with a 50/50 mix of hydrogen peroxide and water. Then rinse with plain water. Get medical attention for further action. Bothe eyes and mouth are exposed. Immediately rinse both as recommende d above and get medical attention for further action. A needle stick or puncture wound . Wash thoroughly with soap and water or pour a small amount of hydrogen peroxide on the wound. Get medical attention for further action. Any bite, scratch or lesion that may have had blood or body fluid exposure. Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water or pour a small amount of hydrogen peroxide on the wound. Cover the wound with a sterile dressing. Get medical attention for further action. Activity: Choose the PPEs (Personal Protective Equipment) necessary for each situation. Be careful! Be safe! goggles gloves gown mask Wash hands 1. You are in the bathroom ready to assist with toileting. 2. Everyone in the house has a stomach flu. Vomit everywhere. You are on the clean -up crew. 3.

MEDICATION ASSISTANCE AND MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION Medication Assistanc e Many of the individuals you support take one or more m edications on an ongoing basis. Some of you have been assisting with medication for a lon g time; for others, this may be a new responsibility. Whatever your level of experience, assisting with medicat ion is a very important activity. The critical skills you will learn are designed to increase safety and reduce the risk of error, thereby providing maximum protection for the individuals you assist as well as yourself. No one wants to be re sponsible for causing injury or harm to someone else. The information being shared in this training will help prevent that. The health of many individuals you support depe nds on your skills in assisting them in taking medications. Your role in assisting individuals to take the right medica tion, in the right dose, by the right route, and at the right time is a very impo rtant function. Medications are substances taken into (or applied to) the body for the purpose of prevention, treatment, relief of symptoms, or cure. Knowing about medication s, their use and abuse, and how to assist individuals in using them is vital to the health and wellbeing of those you serve. Some people you support may be independent in all aspec ts of taking their medications. This means that they maintain their medications independently and are responsible for ensuring they take the medications as prescribed. Wh en this is the case, it will be documented in the person's individual support plan. Requirements for Assisting with Medications DDA Policies and Board of Pharmacy regulati ons are very specific regarding requirements for assisting with medications. You may only assist individuals with self -administration of medications that have been ordered and prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or n urse practitioner. This includes both pr escription and over the -counter medications. The doctor's signed and dated order or pre scription provides instructions for preparation and administration of the medication. Self-Administration of Medications Unless you are a licensed health professional, or have been authorized and trained to perform a specifically delegated nursing task, you may only assist the individual to take medications. Assisting with medications includes: Communicating the prescriber's order to the indivi dual in such a manner that s/he self -administers his/her medication properly. Reminding or coaching the individual when it is time to take a medication. Opening the individual's medication container. Handing the individual the medication container. Placing the medication in the individual's hand. Transferring medication from one container t o another for the purpose of an individual dose (e.g., pouring a liquid med ication from the container to a calibrated spoon or medication cup or using a daptive devices). Altering a medication by crushing, mixing, etc., as long as the indiv idual is aware that the medication is being altered or added to food or beverage. A pharmacist or other qualified practitioner must determine that i t is safe to alter a medication and this must be documented on the prescription container or in the individual's record. Guiding or assist the individual to apply or i nstill skin, nose, eye, and ear preparations. Medication Administration and Nurse Delegation If an individ ual requires assistance with the use of medication beyond that which is described above, the assistance must be provided either by a licensed healthcare professional or a Registered Nurse who delegates the administration of the medication accordingly. You are considered to be \"Nurse Delegated\" when: You have completed Nurse Delegation Core Training. You have a current Nursing Assistant Reg istered (NAR) license Issued by Department of Health (DOH). A Registered Nurse has trained you to the specific tasks for specific individuals. NOTE: The delegated authority to perform the nursing care task is not transferable to another Nursing Assistant. The following are examples of things that you are NOT allowed to do without being specifically delegated for the task: 1. Putting medications into an individual's mouth 2. Hand -over -hand administration 3. Applying a cream, instilling an eye drop or ear drop 4. Glucometer testing (you can, however, read and document blood sugars) 5. Injections --Insulin Only THE INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO REFUSE MEDICATION Although the medication prescribed for individuals is typica lly important for them to take as prescribed, the individual does have the right to refu se to take the medication. Your role as an ISS Staff is to encourage them to take the me dication, ensure that they have the information and support in order to do so. Ultimately, if the individual continues to refuse, you must honor the individual's right and document the choice. You should follow your agency's procedures for reporting and do cumen ting refusals. If an individual refuses to take the medication, ask, \"Why?\" Do not try to crush or hide the medication in the individual's food to get him or her to take the medicine. Reasons for Medication Refusal and Possible Helpful Suggestions The following is a list of some common reasons an individual might refuse to take h is or her medication, and suggestions on how to provide assistance. Unpleasant Taste Tips: Give the individual ice chips to suck on just bef ore taking the medication. This wi ll often help mask the bad taste. Ask the doctor or pharmacist if the medication can be diluted to cover a bad taste. Ask the physician or pharmacist if there is a juice compatible with the medication that can be used (for e xample, apple juice). A note to this effect should be on the prescription label. Provide crackers, apple, or juices afterwards to help cover up the bad taste. Drowsiness Tips: Report the unpleasant side effect and as k the prescribing doctor if the individual can take the medication at a different time (such as before bedtime). Ask about changing the medication or treating the side effect. Pills Difficult to Swallow The individual may be afraid they will choke or it will hurt their throat when they try to swallow a pill. Ask the physician or pharmacist if the pill comes in a coated or capsule form, or if it can be taken with food such as yogurt, applesauce or ice cream, or if it can be crushed and added to food or a liquid. It is important that medication never be altered or mixed with foo d unless ordered by the physician or pharmacist. Always inform the individual if you have mixed medication with food. Lack of Understanding Tips: Provide simple reminders on what the name of the medication is and what the medication does. For example: \"Thi s is Depekene, a medication that stops your seizures.\" Denial of Need for Medication Discuss the need for the medication, but do not argue. It may help to show the individual a statement written by the physician. For example: \"Alma, you take your heart medication every day.\" Documenting and Reporting Refusals Medication refusal needs to be documented on the medication record and brought to the attention of your supervisor. Any unused dose shoul d be set aside and destroyed in an acceptable way. ASSISTIN G WITH SELF -ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICATIONS The following is a step -by-step process for assisting an ind ividual with self -administration of medications. 1. Assist the individual to wash his or her hands. 2. Wash your hands. Hand washing reduces the risk of contamination. 3. Get the Medication Administration Record ( MAR) for the individual you are assisting. Double check that you have the MAR for the right individual. It is important for you to work with only one individual at a time and to complete the task wit h that individual before assisting another. 4. Gather supplies: Take the medications out of the storage containe r or area. It is a good idea to keep all medications for one individual in on e storage unit labeled with the individual's name. Get a calibrated measuring cup or medication spoon for liquid. If person cannot or does not want to take the medication by hand; get paper cup or other container for tablets capsules. Get a glass of water or other food/liquid the individual uses to take the medication. NOTE: you may only add medication to food or liquid if the person is aware that you are adding it. Get a pen for documentation. 5. As you take each medication container from the indi vidual's storage unit, read the medication label and compare to the MAR for the Fi ve Rights: Right Person Right medication Right dose Right time Right route 6. For tablets or capsules, pour the correct dose into the lid of the container, person's hand, or into a small cup. 7. For bubble packs, push all the tablets/capsules fr om the bubble pack into a small container, your glo ved hand, or the person's hand. 8. For liquid medication, pour the correct dose into the m easuring cup held at eye level. View the medicatio n in the cup on a flat surface. Pour away from the medication lab el to avoid staining it with spills. If any medication spil ls on the bottle, wipe it away. \u2014OR\u2014 When using a measuring spoon: Locate the marking for t he dose. Hold the device at eye level and fill to the correct dosage marking. Pour away from the medication label to avoid spills. If any spills on the bottle, wipe away. Additional tips for liquid medication: Check the label to see if the bottle needs to be shaken. Use only a measuring device designed for med ications. Regular eating spoo ns are not accurate enough and should never be used. If too much liquid is poured, do not pour it back into the bottle \u2014discard it. Wash the measuring device and air dry on a paper towel. 9. Talk with the individual you are assisting about w hat you are doing a nd about why he or she is taking each medication. 10. Place the medication within the individual's reach. 11. Offer a glass of water. It is a good idea to suggest to the individual that he tilt his head forward slightly and take a small sip of water b efore the ind ividual places the pill in their mouth. Wetting the mouth may make swallowing easier and tilting the head slightly forward (as opposed to throwing it back) may decrease the risk of choking. If pills are not taken with liquids they can irr itate the throat a nd intestinal tract and they may not be correctly absorbed. Some medications are designed to dissolve instantly and are labeled as \"fast dissolve\"; for these medications it is not necessary to take with water. Some medications must be taken with food, and there may be other special instructions. Make sure that you have read any warni ng labels and are familiar with any special instructions for taking the medication. 12. Make sure that the individual takes the medication and drinks water. Stay with the individual until you are sure t hat he or she has swallowed the medication. If the individual has difficulty drinking an adequat e amount of water or swallowing liquids, you should dis cuss this with your supervisor. Medications should never be disguised by putt ing them in food or liquid. The person must put the medication into his own mouth. Tablets should never be crushed and capsules should not be opened unless the prescribing physician gives the specific direction to do so. If the individual has trouble taking a medication, talk to the individual about his needs and preferences and then talk to the doctor about optional ways to take the medication. 13. Record that the individual took his or her medication by initialing the date and time in the proper box on the MAR. 14. Return the medication containers to the proper area and ensure they are secure. 15. If the person has refused to take some or all of thei r medication, document this and follow your agency's policies for reporting. Never leave the medication container unattended or give to someone else to return to the locked storage container or area. IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT AS TO WHE THER THE MEDICATION IS CORRECT \u2014 WHEN IN DOUBT, CHECK IT OUT Medication Errors Every medication error is serious and could be life thr eatening. Your job is to safely assist individuals to receive the benefits of medications. Preventing medication errors is a priority. In this training you have learned the best way to assist individuals take medication safely and to reduce the risk of errors; however, even in the best o f situations, errors may occur. When they do, you need to know what to do. A medication error occurs in the following situations: The wrong person takes the wrong medication. The wrong dosage is taken. Medication is taken at the wrong time. Medication is taken by the wrong route. Medication is not taken (other than when the individual refuses). Medication is not documented. Every medication must be documented in accordance with your agency's policies. Re member: prevention of medication errors is the #1 Priority. You can prevent errors by observing the following practices: Knowing the individual and his or her medications Asking your supervisor for help if you are unsure about any step in preparing, Stayin g alert Following the Five Rights Avoiding distractions Assisting, or documenting medications The Five Rights Observing the Five Rights is the key to preventing medica tion errors. Be sure you verify the following Rights: 1. Right Individual First, read the name of the individual on the pharmacy l abel for whom the medication is prescribed. If you are uncertain of an individual's name or identity, consult another staff member who knows the individual. 2. Right Medication After you have verified that you ha ve the right i ndividual, read the name of the medication on the label. To make sure that you have the right medication for the right individual, read the label three times and compare it to the informat ion on the individual's MAR. 3. Right Dose Read the medication label for the correct dosage. Be alert to any changes in the dosage. Pay attention to the use of multiple tablets providi ng a single dose of medication. Pay attention to any change in the colo r, size, or form of medication. Be suspiciou s of sudden large increases in medication dosages. 4. Right Time Read the medication label for directions as to wh en and how often the medication should be taken. Medication must be taken at a specific time(s ) of the day. Stay with the individual until you are certain that he or she has taken the medication. You should supervise the medication within one hour o f prescribed time as written on MAR. This means: as early as one hour before and as late as one hour after time written on MAR. Pay attention to the following details: Are foods or liquids to be taken with the medication? Are there certain foods or liquids to avoid when taking the medication? Is there a certain period of time to take the med ication in relation to foods or liquids? Is it the right time of day, such as morning or evening? 5. Right Route Read the medication label for the appropriate route (or w ay) to take the medication. The route for tablets, capsules, and liquids is oral . This means that the medication enters the body through the mouth. Other routes include: nasal sprays; topical (which includes dermal patches or ointments to be applied to the skin); eye drops (ophthalmic); and ear (otic) drops. Other more intrusive routes, such as intravenous administrations, intr amuscular, or subcutaneous injections; rectal and vaginal suppositories; or enemas are only to be self- administered, nurse delegated, or administered by a licensed health care professional . Skill: Medication Assistance 1. S.W.I.P.E.S. 2. Remind the individual it is correct, scheduled time to take his/her prescribed medication. 3. Take the medication container from where it is stored, look at the label, and verify the 5 Rights \u2014 medication, individual, amount, route, and time. 4. Open the container, look a t the label and verify the 5 Rights again. 5. Hand the correct dosage to the individual, hand the open container to the individual, or transfer the medication to an enabler. 6. Offer the individual a full glass of fluid (for oral medications). 7. Observe and make sure the medication is taken. 8. Close the medication container and put it back in the appropriate place. Read the label and verify the 5 Rights once again. 9. Document that the individual has taken the medication. If he/she has not, document that as well. 10. Common care practices were followed. 11. Wash hands.(skill taught in Safety training) When assisting an individual, you must read and compare the information on the medication label to the information on the MAR before the individual t akes the medication. By doing so, you are helping to ensure that you are assisting the right individual with the right medication and dose at the rig ht time, and in the right route (way). Never assist an individual with medication from a container that has no label! If, at any time, you discover that the information does not match, stop and resolve the issue before supervising the medication. If you are unsure, you may need to get help. Ask another staff, your supervisor, or in some situa tions, you may need to call the doctor or pharmacist. Pharmacy Abbreviations and Symbols The following abbreviations and symbols are commonl y used on medication labels. In order to read and understand medication labels, yo u should be familiar with these abbreviations and symbols: Rx = Prescription tsp. = teaspoon (or 5 ml) OTC = Over -the-Counter Tbsp. = tablespoon (3 tsps or 15 ml) PRN = when necessary, or as needed oz = ounce Qty = quantity gr = grains q (Q) = every mg = milligrams qd = daily GM, gm = grams (1,000 mg) b.i.d. (BID) = twice a day Cap = capsule t.i.d. (TID) = three times a day Tab = tablet q.i.d. (QID) = four times a day A.M. = morning h. = hour P.M. = afternoon/evening h.s. (HS) = hour of sleep (bedtime) D/C or d/c = discontinue Oral medica tions (capsules or tablets) are usually pres cribed in mg (milligrams) or gm (grams). Liquid medications are usually prescribed in ml (milliliters), cc (centimeters), or oz(ounces). Liquid medica tions may also be prescribed in tsp (teaspoon), or Tbsp (tablespoon). USAGE, PURPOSE, AND SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATIONS Medication safety includes learning about the medications that you are as sisting another to take. Know the answers to all of the following questions: What is the medication, and why is it prescribed? What are the proper dosage, frequency, and route for taking the medication (for example by mouth, topical)? How many refills are authorized? What are the start and end dates for the medic ation? Should it be taken for 7 days, 10 days, or ongoing? Are there possible side effects? If so, to wh om should these side effects be reported? What should be done if a dose is missed? Are there a ny special storage requirements? Are there any special instructions for use o f this medication? For example, should certain foods, beverages, other medicines, or activities be avoided? What improvements should be expected, and when will they start showing? Most of this information can be obtained by reading the individual's record. Other sources of information include medication reference b ooks from your local library or bookstore. Websites such as safemedication.com or rxlist.com also provide medication information. If you do not find this information in the record, follow your agency's po licies to obtain the information. You should know why medications are prescribed (t heir purpose) and what they are intended to do, so that you can monitor how effective t hey are. If a medication is not effective, this should be reported to your supervisor and to the individual's prescriber so that it can be addressed. Some medications take longer than others in order to be effective. Your role is to monitor, document and report the effectiveness. Side Effects of Medication The unintended effects of medication, called side effects , can occur at any time. Some mild side effects may disappear after a short time. Others w ill persist the entire time the medication is taken and sometimes beyond. Some side effects are mild, while others are life threatening. In the home where you work, it is important to learn about the medications each individual is taking. It is also impor tant to know what possible side effects may occur. Be su re to ask the doctor what kind of reactions should be brought immediately to his or her attention. The pharmacy is a good source for information on the effects of medication. Medication information sh eets should come with every new medication. Physical and behavioral changes that are due to the effect of a medication are often difficult to identify. There may be many different reason s for the same sign or symptom. A change in behavior may be due to a medication cha nge or a change in the person's environment . A sore throat may be one of the first symp toms of a cold or may be a side effect of a medication. Your responsibility is to consistently and accurately observe, report, and record any change in the normal daily routine, behavior, communication, appearanc e, physical health, and general manner or mood of the individual you support. Interpreta tion (deciding the meaning) of an observed side effect is the responsibility of the individual's doctor. For each individual you support: Know the intended and unintended effects of each medication he or she takes. Observe for intended and unintended effects of the medication. Document what you observe. Report observations to the doctor. Follow the doctor's directions to continue, change, or discontinue the medication. Monitor the individual closely for side effects when a new medication has been pres cribed or the dosage increased. It is not uncommon for two or more medications to interact with one another, causing unwanted side effects. An example of this w ould be when i ron or Penicillin is given with an antacid. The antacid prevents the iron or Penici llin from being absorbed in the stomach. Some people have allergic reactions to medications. W hen this is known, it should be documented in the individual's record. When a ne w medication is prescribed, you should verify that it is not one tha t the person is allergic to. If you notice signs of a potential allergic reaction (e.g., rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), immediately report this to a health profess ional. Common Side Effects of Medication You Should Report to the Doctor Include: Skin Rash Increased heart rate or feeling like the heart is racing Changes in sleep Decreased energy Sedation Changes in weight or eating patterns Tremors, shakiness Balance problems Shuffling when walking Abnormal movements (face, tongue, or body) Muscle pain Stooped posture Blank facial expression Feeling dizzy or light -headed Dry mouth Constipation Blurred vision Diarrhea Confusion Changes in ability to concentrate Hyperactivity Nausea Vomiting Increased risk of sunburn Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) is a potential long- term neurologic al side effect of antipsychotic medications such as Mellaril, Thorazine, Rispe rdal, and Zyprexa. Symptoms may include rapid eye blinking, puckering, or chewing motions o f the lips and mouth, or facial grimacing. Symptoms may worsen if the medication is not reduced or discontinued. TD can become permanent. Discuss this risk with the psychiatrist or doctor before starting antipsychotic medicat ions. You should monitor individuals for these serious side effects on a regular basis. If any possible side effects are observed, contact the health care provider immediately. Following Doctor's Orders for Tests Some medications (e.g., Tylenol, Lithium, Depakene) can be toxic and cause damage, especially if taken for a long period of time. Some ind ividuals respond differently to medications; that is, some use and break down medic ations in their body slower (or faster) than others. For this reason, physici ans sometimes st art a new medication at low doses and increase it in response to signs of a positive effect, such as a reduction in seizures or the development of better sleep patterns. Checking blood serum levels by analyzing the concentrations of medicat ions in an indiv idual's blood can be important. Physicians' orders for lab tests and follow up appoi ntments must be followed. Blood serum level tests help the physician determine the effectiveness of the medication and the future course of action. Severe, Life-Threatening Allergies (Anaphylaxis) Some individuals have severe allergies to medications, especially penicillin. The allergic reaction is sudden and severe and may cause difficulty breathing and a drop in blood pressure (anaphylactic shock). If an i ndividual has had a severe allergic reaction to a medication (or insect stings or food), s/he should wear an identification bracelet that will tell health professionals about the allergy. Call 9- 1-1 immediately to get emergency medical car e if signs of a severe allergic reaction develop, especially soon after taking a medication. Signs of an allergic reaction: Wheezing or difficulty breathing Swelling around the lips, tongue, or face Skin rash, itching, feeling of warmth, or hives Some individuals have a severe allergy to insect stings or certain foods. If an individual shows any of these same signs of a severe allergic react ion soon after eating a food or being stung by an insect, call 9- 1-1 immediately to get emergency medical care. Common Categories of Medication Based on Effects Drugs are classified into categories or classes with othe r medications that have similar effects. There are thousands of medications. Many drugs, because of their multiple uses, can be found in more than one category. S ome of the common categories of medications used include: anticonvulsants (to preve psychotropic medications that include antidepressants and anti -psycho tics. STORAGE AND DISPOSAL OF MEDICATIONS Storage of Medications Medications must be stored so they are not readily a vailable to others. Medications stored in an individual's room must be kept so that h ousemates do not have access to them. In most cases, the medications are kept lock ed and only accessed with staff supervision. The must be stored under proper conditions for sanita tion, temperature, moisture and ventilation, and separate fr om food or toxic chemicals; and The must also be stored in the original medication cont ainers with pharmacist - prepared or manufacturer's label, or in medication organizers whi ch are clearly labeled with the following information: Name of the person for whom the medication is prescribed Medications included Dosage frequency You are not allowed to fill medication organizers. Medication organizers can only be used when they are filled by one of the following persons: The individual A pharmacist A Registered Nurse The individual's family member Disposal of Medications Medicati ons that have been discontinued, have been dropped, or are expired need to be disposed of properly and documented appro priately. Be sure you know your a gency's disposal policy and follow it when medications need to be disposed. Be aware of Confidentiality issues and take appropriate measures to protect information.

For each sign or symptom listed in the left column, decide if you should respond by calling 9 -1-1, placing an urgent call to the doctor, calling your supervisor or emergency cell responder, or providing routine treatment at home. If there is more than one choice you would make then prioritize the m: First Action is 1, next is 2, t hird is 3, and last is 4. Sign or Symptom Routine Treatment at Home Call supervisor or emergency cell Call Doctor Call 911 Onset of fever of 101 degrees or higher New or sudden onset of incontinence Rash lasting several days or getting worse Bleeding that can't be controlled Sever e sore throat / difficulty swallowing Infection at injury sight Sleeping most of the day, unusual difficulty in arousing; unusual fatigue Scratching / holding one or both ears Holding abdomen Diarrhea or vomiting lasting more than four hours A seizure lasting five minutes; continuous seizures Paralysis; numbness; confusion Onset of limping; difficulty in movement after a fall Mosquito bite Trouble breathing or breathing in a strange way Visible swelling with doctor's order to elevate the leg Minor cut Is or becomes unconscious not related to a seizure No pulse Any evidence of pain or discomfort Chest pain or pressure Severe injuries, such as broken bones Choking (not breathing and not coughing) Injuries to the head, neck, or back Bee sting Has gone into shock Medical Emergencies Levels of Emergency R esponse: 1. Calling 9- 1-1: medical emergencies that require immediate medical attention; the individual is in imminent danger; and/or a crime has taken place. 2. Urgent Call to Doctor: potentially serious signs or symptoms that require an urgent report to the in dividual's doctor. 3. Routine Treatment: signs or symptoms that are addressed by simple First Aid or written doctor's orders. Calling 9 -1-1 A 9-1-1 call involves medical emergencies that require immediate medical attention. If you think you need to call 911, do it ! Don't call someone to ask if you should. If you have any question in your mind, make the call. Timeliness in recognizing signs and symptoms that require emergency medical treatment can be the difference between life and death. Always call 9-1-1 if the following occurs: Bleeding that can't be controlled Unconsciousness (not related to a seizure) No pulse Trouble breathing or breathing in a strange way Chest pain or pressure Severe injuries, such as broken bones as a result of an accident Choking (not breathing and not coughing) Injuries to the head, neck, or back Shock A seizure lasting five minutes, continuous seizures, or based on doctor's instruction Electrical shock Drowning or near drowning Paralysis, numbness, confusion Severe burns (burns that cove more than one part of the body or on head, neck, hands, feet, or genitals) Imminent danger A crime has been committed Mental health emergency When you call 9 -1-1, tell them: Who you are Where you are What has happened When it happened Stay on the phone until the dispatcher tells you to hang up. While waiting for emergency medical personnel, stay calm and reassure the individual, stay with him or her, and do necessary first -aid and/or CPR. If possible, send another person to watch for the ambulance to quickly guide the emergency personnel to the scene. When the emergency personnel arrive, provide them with additional information including current medications, allergies, insurance information, and the name and phone number of the individual's primary doctor. It is a good idea to also call the primary doctor as soon as you can. Urgent Call to Doctor An urgent call to a doctor is prompte d by potentially serious signs or symptoms that require a timely report to the individual's doctor. Some signs and symptoms indicate a need for urgent medical care. In these situations, you should call the individual's doctor and report the signs and symptoms so that the doctor can assess the person's condition and determine the appropriate course of action. While the person's life may not be immediately threatened, the signs and symptoms listed below are serious, and you must report them to the indiv idual's doctor as soon as they are identified. Examples of changes that may be signs and symptoms of illness or injury and that require an urgent call to the doctor: Rapid change in behavior or an increase in challenging behavior (such as aggression or se lf-injurious behavior) Sleeping most of the day; unusual difficulty in arousing; unusual fatigue Scratching or holding one or both ears Holding abdomen Dramatic change in facial expression or demeanor Evidence of pain or discomfort that is not easily expla ined New or sudden onset of incontinence Onset of fever of 101 degrees or higher Diarrhea or vomiting lasting more than four hour Rash lasting several days or getting worse Increase in seizure activity Onset of limping, inability to walk, or difficulty in movement Severe sore throat/difficulty swallowing Infection at injury site Swelling Always report these changes to the doctor as soon as possible. When in doubt, call the doctor. When you call the doctor, stay on the phone until you get assistance. If you think the doctor did not understand how serious the situation is, or if it gets worse, call 9- 1-1. Your actions can save a life. HOW TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN A SAFE HOME ENVIRONMENT Falls commonly occur on flights of stairs, ladders, chairs and stools, roo fs, and when getting in and out of bathtubs. Some falls are caused by individuals who step on an unseen object, such as marbles or a skateboard. Individuals of all ages fall o ut of bed or fall while getting out of bed. One of every four falls takes place o n a level surface. Falls are caused frequently by carelessness. Some people just trip. Others are in too much of a hurry, playing roughly, or don't see an object before they fall over it. Some falls are caused by health problems such as fainting, poor eyes ight, hypertension, osteoporosis of the hip, or overmedication. Sometimes people fall when they are assisting others. The individuals you support are at an increased risk of falling and of suffering injury due to their disabilities, medication, and/or hea lth problems. Individuals with a seizure disorder sometimes experience hard falls that result in injuries during their seizures. Similarly, poor coordination and muscle control associat ed with cerebral palsy can cause someone to fall, especially when the i ndividual has a wobbly or unsteady gait. Ways to Prevent Falls: Identify individuals at risk for falling and document fall precautions in the IISP. Be sure individuals needing assistive devices (canes, walkers) use them and store them properly. Keep cords , wires, and hoses out of walkways. Make sure adequate staff are available when an individual is physically lifted from one place to another, and make sure there is enough space. Provide handrails and guard rails at all elevated walkways or stairs. Use safety adaptations in the shower, such as a rubber mat in the bathtub or shower stall, a shower bench when the individual is unsteady or not well coordinated, or grab bars in the bathtub or shower stall. Keep the floors dry and clutter free. Install nightl ights in bedrooms, halls, and bathrooms. Be sure nothing (clothes, toys, books) is left on stairways or on the floor. Use non -skid matting under floor rugs. Carpet stairs and put a rubber runner on stairs to basement. Replace worn out carpet and make sure it doesn't come loose. Use a ladder rather than stretching to reach something. Use well -maintained ladders and always have another individual close by. Provide good outdoor lighting on walks and driveways. When it is icy, put sand or salt on porches and ot her walkways. Remove snow. Emerge ncy Response to a Fall Incident Even with the best precautions, falls may occur. The degree and care with which you provide immediate assistance, prevent additional injury, and obtain medical assistance (if necessary) is what makes the difference in the result of a fall. Once you become aware of the situation, carefully and quickly assess the situation by listening, observing, and questioning: Listen to what the individual is telling you. Observe the position of his body and look for signs of bleeding, broken limbs, or breathing problems. Ask the individual what he or she is feeling. Your response to an individual's fall depends on the circumstances of the fall, the individual's ongoing health status, and what injury the individual appears to have sustained. If an individual appears to be seriously hurt, is bleeding badly, complains of sharp pain, appears to have a broken bone or appears to have a change of consciousness, CALL 9 -1-1 FOR ASSISTANCE. DO NOT MOVE THE INDIVIDU AL. Document all falling incidents in the individual's record and complete an Incident Report, if required. Disasters and Other Emergencies Responding to a Powe r Outage When the power goes out, it can be quite unnerving, especially if it happens during the dark hours of the night. During a disaster situation, electric power can be out for days or weeks. It is important to plan ahead for the possibility of losing electric power. Know where the flashlight and other emergency supplies are kept. Keep at leas t two or three flashlights in your home and make sure there are spare batteries. If the power goes out check your neighborhood/apartment complex to see if others are without power. If you are the only home/unit without power, contact the landlord and request they determine what has caused the outage, e.g. the circuit breaker has been tripped, etc. Turn off all large appliances until power has been restored. If the power outage is external to your home follow these guidelines: Sometimes when power is resto red power levels can vary considerable and damage electrical appliances. Therefore you will want to turn off the lights and all electric appliances except for the refrigerator and freezer. After you have turned off the lights, go back and turn on one singl e light so that you will know when the power is working again. Wait at least 15 minutes before turning on the remaining appliances after the power has been restored. People who depend on electrical equipment for health issues should have a plan in advance of a power outage. This may mean purchasing a backup power supply such as a generator. They should register with the local utility so their home will be noted with top priority for power supply restoration. If a generator is used always follow the manufact urer's instruction and run them outdoors to prevent fumes from causing carbon monoxide poisoning. Plug the generator directly into the appliance you want to operate, not into your home's main electrical panel which could result in serious injury or death. It is important to keep freezer and refrigerator doors closed to prevent the loss of cold air. A fully loaded refrigerator may keep food fresh for about six hours. A fully loaded freezer may keep food frozen for up to two days. If your power may be out f or more than a few hours try to eat refrigerated foods first, then frozen foods, then non- perishable items. Never use charcoal, gas, or propane heaters indoors. Doing so can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning (see Carbon Monoxide Poisoning section in this chapter). Poisoning Accidental poisoning is one of the most tragic and preventable causes of injury. A poison is a substance that causes injury o r illness if it gets into the body. There are four ways a poison can enter the body: 1. Swallowing 2. Breathing 3. Touching 4. Injecting Combinations of certain substances can be poisonous; however, they might not cause harm if taken alone. Not everyone reacts to poisons in the same way. A substance that harmful to one individual may not always be harmful to another. Preventing Poisonings Many common household chemical products are poisonous and deserve special handling and labeling. All potentially poisonous products found in the home must be: stored in their original containers; kept separate from food items; and inaccessible to individuals who may not understand their level of dangerousness, in order to prevent individuals from eating, drinking them or getting the substance on their skin or in their eyes. Common Household Poisons Alcohol Laundry deterg ent Mothballs Dishwasher detergent Nail polish and nail polish remover Drain cleaner Oven cleaner Drugs of any kind Glass cleaner Furniture polish Scouring pads Scouring powder/pads Toilet cleaner Weed killer Air freshener Insecticide Bleach Cigarettes and tobacco Cosmetics Glass cleaner Grease remover Any cleaning product Paint and paint thinner Any medication Some household plants Be Prepared Even when preventive steps are taken, an accidental poisoning may occur. If this happens, you must get emergency medical assistance as quickly as possible. In emergency situations, the DSP staff who is prepared and who maintains control is the most helpful . You might believe that you know what you would do in an emergency, but it is at this critical time that you just might find you are not prepared. The first step in being prepared to handle an accidental poisoning is to post the Poison Control phone numbe r: 1-800- 222-1222 next to the phone in a way to avoid its being moved. Emergency Response to a Poisoning Incident Immediately call the Poison Control Center and remain calm. Have someone stay with the individual. Report the source of the poisoning (brand name and label, if possible). Report the amount ingested (if you don't know, say so). Report age and weight of the individual. Report elapsed time since the incident occurred. If an individual appears to have been poisoned, first call the Poison Control Center for advice: 1 -800-222- 1222, then call 911 Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death. It is found in combustion fumes, such as those produced by automobiles, small engines, stoves, lanterns, burning charcoal and wood, gas ranges and heating systems. CO from these sources can build up in enclosed or semi -enclosed spaces. People in these spaces can be poiso ned by breathing it. Common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain and confusion. High levels of CO inhalation can cause loss of consciousness and death. People who are sleeping or intoxicated can die from CO poisoning before ever experiencing symptoms. If you or someone you are with develops signs or symptoms of CO poisoning get into fresh air immediately and call 911 for emergency medical help. Risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is reduced by: Not using a gas range or oven for heating Not using a charcoal grill or barbecue grill indoors Not using a portable gas grill or camp stove indoors Not using a generator inside your home, basement, garage or near a window, door or vent Not using portable flameless c hemical heaters (catalytic) indoors Ensuring fireplace and stove is well vented Ensuring all gas appliances are vented so that CO will not build up in your home Having your chimney checked and cleaned every year Never running an automobile in the garage with the garage door shut Ensuring that, If you drive a vehicle with a rear cargo door open (such as in a mini -van or SUV), you open vents or windows to make sure air is moving through your car Installing a battery operated CO detector in your home and che cking or replacing the battery when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall For placement of CO detectors, manufacturer's recommendations differ to a degree, based on research conducted with each one's specific detector; therefore, make sur e to read the provided installation manual for each detector before installing. (Information on HOMESAFE.com website.) Drowning Drowning prevention is a concern both in bathing and recreational water activities. It is important to be familiar with the needs of the individual you are supporting as it pertains to activities involving water. During bathing activities, it may be take necessary to take precautions to protect the individual from harm, while at the same time maintaining their privacy and dignity. Bathing Drowning while bathing is a serious problem which has resulted in the recent deaths of several individuals with developmental disabilities. Several of these accidents resulted from individuals being left alone. However, a person can drown in a c upful of water in a short period of time. Individuals with developmental disabilities rely on on ISS staff to make correct judgments to ensure their safety and welfare. Individuals with seizure disorders and physical disabilities are at an increased risk of harm while in water. Drowning from a seizure in a bathtub represents a small, but potentially preventable accident. Some individuals you work with may have a specific bathing or showering plan that must be followed. If you have questions or concerns abo ut the plan or it is not clear what you are required to do, ask your supervisor for clarification. Water Activities Precautions that prevent drowning during recreational water activities: Don't allow rough play or running near a swimming pool. Don't allow diving into water that is less than four feet deep. Keep electrical cords and devices away from water. Encourage all individuals who do not swim well to use an approved personal flotation device when swimming or life jacket when riding in a boat. When swi mming, it is always a good idea to make sure a certified life guard is present. Emergency Response to Drowning Remove the person from the water. If another person is present, call 9 -1-1 while the other person administers First Aid/CPR. If alone, call 9 -1-1 first and then administer First Aid/CPR. When safe to do so, follow your agencies policy when reporting an emergency. MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES It is your responsibility to be familiar with the individual's Individual Instruction Support Plan, especially if the individual has a Positive Behavior Support Plan and/or Cross Systems Crisis Plan. Incorporated in these documents is information regarding when to access law enforcement and/or mental health agencies. MISSING INDIVIDUAL An individual is considered missing under the following conditions: An individual who does not require 24 -hour scheduled support misses a scheduled appointment and cannot be contacted for two (2) hours (unless the individual's plan indicates a different time period). An individual who receives 24 -hour scheduled support is out of contact with staff for more than two (2) hours without prior arrangement (unless the individual's plan indicates a different time period). An individual without good survival skills may be consider ed in \"immediate jeopardy\" when missing for any period of time based on his/her personal history, regardless of the hours of support received. Follow your agency's policy and procedures with regard to missing individuals. HOW TO PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND T O NATURAL OR OTHER DISASTERS: ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCIES (FIRE, EARTHQUAKE, AND FLOOD) We can rarely predict environmental emergencies, but we can do our best to prepare for them. The manner in which you react in an emergency depends upon your recognition of potential risks, your skill in following the emergency plan, and your ability to remain calm in the face of uncertainty. Some environmental emergencies are internal, such as when a fire occurs within the home. Others are external , such as when an earth quake, flood, tornado, toxic spill, or other event outside the home interferes with power, water, food supplies, or other essential services. Some external disasters trigger internal ones as well, such as when a flood damages a home, or an earthquake trigg ers a fire. External disasters\u2014 which include floods, earthquakes, high winds, toxic spills and the like \u2014typically disrupt travel, communications, and basic utilities (e.g., gas, water, and electricity) and put an intense strain on emergency services, including medical care. Once a disaster occurs, there are four questions that must be asked: 1. Are there injuries that require First Aid and medical attention? 2. Does the home have to be evacuated, or is it safe to occupy? 3. Are there sources of food and water? 4. Has the disaster interfered with public utilities, such as gas, electricity, and communications? The Four P's: Prepare, Plan, Practice, Perform To minimize the likelihood of an environmental emergency and to respond well, follow the \"4 Ps\": PREP ARE: Have the right things available. PLAN: Decide who will do what. PRACTICE: Schedule fire and disaster drills. PERFORM: Use your knowledge and skills to take the right action in an emergency. Following the \"4 Ps\" helps one minimize the likelihood of an environmental emergency and respond to such an emergency well. PREPARE Every home needs to have critical supplies on hand because of the disruption environmental disasters create. In addition to fire extinguishers and smoke detectors that every home should have, each household needs a number of other items, including: First Aid kit and First Aid book Disaster Kits A current posted Disaster Plan, with information about relocation, Poison Control, and physician names and telephone numbers It is also suggested that each home has an emergency supply of food and water. In addition, have a number of items for each individual living in the home including: List of current medications and prescribing physician Currently prescribed medications on hand Emergency information (e.g., name, date of birth, home address, and phone number of individual; name, address, and phone number of administrator; medical insurance numbers; known allergies and food sensitivities; and name, address, and phone number of relatives or closest friends) State medical or other insurance card Other personal and health- related information in a readily accessible form A change of clothing, rain gear, and sturdy shoes Blankets or sleeping bag Any needed adaptive equipment or assistive devic e (for example, wheelchair, extra pair of glasses) PLAN Learn your agency's home disaster preparedness plan. Understanding the reason for actions you should take may also result in identifying strategies for a more successful plan. PRACTICE Know how to r espond appropriately to an external disaster through practice. Knowing you need to turn off the gas is only useful if you know how to do this and have the tools to complete the task. Practice the following responses to a disaster: Turning off gas, water, and electricity Providing first aid Getting individuals to the assistance they need Communicating with other staff PERFORM The nature of an external disaster will dictate how best to respond at the time. It is always advisable to stay calm. For example: i n an earthquake, the best way to respond depends on where you are at the time. If you are inside a building, stay away from windows, stand in a doorway, or crouch under a sturdy desk or table. If you are outside, stand away from buildings, trees, and telephone and electrical lines. If you are in a car, drive away from underpasses or overpasses, stop in a safe area, and stay in the car . Responding to Disasters: Earthquakes If indoors DROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. If there isn't a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building. Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything t hat could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture. Stay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest sa fe place. Use a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, loadbearing doorway. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave. Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on. DO NOT use the elevators. If outdoors Stay there. Move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires. Once in the open, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings, at exits and alongside exterior walls. Most earthquake related casualties result from collapsing w alls, flying glass, and falling objects. If in a moving vehicle Stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. A void roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake. If trapped under debris Do not light a match Do not move about or kick up dust. Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust. After an earthquake: Check for injuries and provide any needed first aid. Check for gas, water, electrical, or other breaks. Turn off utilities where danger exists (for example, if you smell gas, turn off gas near meter). Check for building damage (for example, around chimneys and foundations). Clean up dangerous spills (for example, glass or water). Turn on your radio and listen for instructions. Use the telephone only for emergencies. Floods Floods are the most common and widespread of all natural disasters. If you live in an area where floods occur, you should know the following: What to do before a flood Plan for evac uation including where you are going to go and the route you will follow. Prepare your home for a flood. Call your local building department or office of emergency management for information. Purchase flood insurance. Keep all insurance policies and a l ist of valuable items in a safe place. Take photos or a videotape of the valuables you keep in your home. Listen to your radio or television for reports of flood danger. Keep your car filled with gas. What to do during a flood Do not try to walk or dr ive through flooded areas. Water can be deeper than it appears and water levels rise quickly. Follow official emergency evacuation routes. If your car stalls in floodwater, get out quickly and move to higher ground. Stay away from moving water; moving wat er six inches deep can sweep you off your feet. Cars are easily swept away in just two feet of water. Stay away from disaster areas unless authorities ask for volunteers. Stay away from downed power lines. If your home is flooded, turn the utilities off until emergency officials tell you it is safe to turn them on. Do not pump the basement out until floodwater recedes. Avoid weakened floors, walls and rooftops. Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water if you come in contact with floodwaters. What to do after a flood Wear gloves and boots when cleaning up. Open all doors and windows. Use fans if possible to air out the building. Wash all clothes and linens in hot water. Discard mattresses and stuffed furniture. They can't be adequately cleaned. Wash dirt and mud from walls, counters and hard surfaced floors with soap and water. Disinfect by wiping surfaces with a solution of one cup bleach per gallon of water. Discard all food that has come into contact with floodwater. Canned food is alright, but thoroughly wash the can before opening. If your well is flooded, your tap water is probably unsafe. If you have public water, the health department will let you know \u2014through radio and television \u2014if your water is not safe to drink. Until your water is safe, use clean bottled water. Learn how to purify water. If you have a well, learn how to decontaminate it. Do not use your septic system when water is standing on the ground around it. The ground be low will not absorb water from sinks or toilets. When the soil has dried, it is probably safe to again use your septic system. To be sure, contact your local health department. When floodwaters have receded, watch out for weakened road surfaces. Tsunamis A tsunami is a series of destructive waves affecting shorelines. Tsunamis are usually generated by earthquakes. Tsunamis may also be caused by underwater landslides or underwater volcanic eruptions. Tsunami dangers Tsunami waves can be created b y events thousands of miles from our beaches. Tsunami waves can be as tall as 30 feet when they come ashore; 100 feet in extreme cases. They can move inland from several hundred feet to several miles. A tsunami can cause a series of waves that arrive over several hours. Later waves can be larger than the first wave. Tsunamis move faster than a person can run. Tsunamis have enormous power \u2014enough to move rocks weighing several tons, boats and other debr is. Homes and other buildings can be destroyed. People can be killed or injured by the force of the water. Tsunami definitions The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) can issue a tsunami watch or warning within 15 minutes after an earth quake. Tsunami Advisory An advisory reports a threat of a potential tsunami that may produce strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or near the water. Listen to your radio, NOAA Weather Radio, or TV for updates on the watch. Know well in advance wh at your safest evacuation route will be. Local officials will determine appropriate actions such as closing beaches, evacuating people, repositioning ships, etc. Tsunami Watch A watch reports conditions that may cause a tsunami. Listen to your radio, NOAA Weather Radio, or TV for updates on the watch. Know well in advance what your safest evacuation route will be. Tsunami Warning A warning reports that a tsunami may have been generated. Move to higher ground or inland. If no higher ground is near, go to upper levels of reinforced buildings. Continue to monitor your local radio or NOAA Weather Radio for further information and instructions. Wait for the \"All Clear\" before you return to the beach or to your home. What to do at the beach Immediately head for high ground; do not wait for a warning if: The ground shakes. You hear a siren. The ocean recedes dramatically from the shoreline. Coastal evacuation signs Tsunami evacuation route signs have been placed along coastal roadways to i ndicate the direction inland or to higher ground. In some places, there may be more than one route to safer areas. These routes may be marked with several signs showing additional options for evacuation. You should know the evacuation routes for your area. Cold Weather Winter storms can range from moderate snow over a few hours to blizzard conditions with blinding, wind- driven snow or freezing rain that lasts several days. The time to prepare is before the snow falls or ice forms. Preparing for winter storms Listen to your radio or television for winter storm forecasts and other information. Prepare your home for cold weather. Install storm windows. Insulate outside walls, attics and crawl spaces. Wrap pipes, especially those near cold outer walls or i n attics or crawl spaces. Repair leaks in the roof, around the doors and in the windows. Have appropriate cold weather clothing available. If you have a kerosene heater, refuel your heater outside and remember to keep it at least three feet from flammable objects. Make sure your fireplace functions properly. Have rock salt and sand on hand for traction on ice. Fill your gas tank before the snow starts falling. During a winter storm Wear several layers of loose -fitting, lightweight, warm clothing rather than one layer of heavy clothing. Wear mittens rather than gloves. Wear a warm, woolen cap. Do not drive unnecessarily. Reduce the temp erature in your home to conserve fuel. Heat only the areas of your home you are using. Close doors and curtains or cover windows and doors with blankets. Use alternative heat methods safely. Never use a gas or charcoal grill, hibachi or portable propane heater to cook indoors or heat your home. Never use a generator indoors or in a garage or carport. Be careful when shoveling snow. Do not overexert yourself. Be sure to eat regularly. Food provides calories that maintain body heat. Watch for signs of f rostbite and hypothermia \u2014 slurred speech, disorientation, uncontrollable shivering, stumbling, drowsiness and body temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit or less. If you become trapped outside, get out of the wind and stay dry. Build a lean- to or snow cave if nothing else is available. Do not eat snow; it will make you too cold. Bring dogs and cats inside during cold weather. If in your vehicle Make sure someone knows where you are going. Stay on the main roads. If you must stop, remain inside the vehicl e. Use a bright distress flag or your hazard lights to draw attention to your vehicle. If trapped in a blizzard, clear your tail pipe and run your engine and heater for 10 minutes every hour. Open your window slightly. During night hours, keep the dome light on in the car so rescue crews can see your vehicle. Keep an emergency kit in your vehicle. Include a three -day supply of water and non- perishable food that can be eaten without being cooked. Include a blanket or sleeping bag for each passenger, a flashlight, cell phone, shovel, sack of sand or kitty litter, booster cables, flare, coffee can with lid, and toilet paper. Radiation Exposure One possible source of radiation exposure is a \"dirty bomb.\" A dirty bomb is a small explosive device packaged with radioactive materials. During any event that releases r adiation, your best protection is to follow the recommendations of authorities. Stay inside Stay inside your home or office unless instructed by civil authorities to leave. Close the windows, turn off the heating or a ir conditioning, and stay near the ce nter of the building. Once the initial blast is over, radioactive materials may be spread in the smoke and debris in the air. By staying inside you will reduce any potential exposure to airborne radioactive material. I f there is a basement, go there. Listen to the radio When you learn that radioactive materials have been released in an area near you \u2014either accidentally or intentionally \u2014 tune your radio to the emergency broadcasting network for instructions. Government agencies will let you know how to prote ct yourself. Keep a battery -powered radio handy in case electrical power goes out in your area. Follow instructions The best way to avoid exposure to radiation is to do what experts advise. If told to evacuate, do so promptly. Take items you will need for an extended absence, such as prescription medicines and clothing. Listen for news about the location of the radioactive cloud. Even if it has already passed, radioactive contamination may have fallen on the ground and experts will recommend the best ways to safely leave the area. If you suspect you are contaminated If you believe you have been exposed to radioactive materials, you should carefully remove your outer layer of clothing and put it in a plastic bag; then take a warm shower to rinse off any rad ioactive materials. Place the sealed plastic bag in a room away from people. Seek help if needed Special assistance centers will be set up as soon as possible. Center locations will be made available through the media and on health department and other em ergency service Web sites. If this information is not yet available, go to a police or fire station located outside of the affected area. If you were near the explosion or believe you were in the path of the cloud, tell the staff at the station or assistan ce center. Watch what you eat Avoid drinking fresh milk or eating fruits and vegetables grown in the affected area. Wait until the Department of Health announces that produce and dairy products are safe to eat and drink. Milk, fruit and vegetables are oka y to eat if they were bought or picked before the radiation was released and were stored indoors. Food stored in cans or bags is also safe to eat. Be sure to thoroughly rinse off containers before opening. Responding to Disasters: Fires Fires are the third leading cause of accidental deaths in the home. They often result in serious injury and cause extensive property damage. One third of deaths from fire (burning or smoke inhalation) occur between midnight and 4:00 a.m., when most people are sleeping. Preventing the fire is the number one priority. Many fires are the result of neglect, indifference, carelessness (the most common cause of fire is careless smoking), or laziness. We can do something about these things. Preventing Fires Consider \"rate of rise\" smoke detectors in kitchens and garages, places more likely to have a fire where there is a sudden change of temperature with little smoke. Bedrooms and living rooms should have hardwired smoke detectors with battery backup. Smoke detectors wired in to an alarm system provide additional security. If the detectors are battery operated, they should be checked monthly, and batteries should be replaced at least yearly. Fire prevention is a team activity. A number of things can be done to minimize fire ha zards in the home: Check smoke detectors monthly and replace batteries annually or as needed. Use canned smoke, not an open flame, to test smoke detectors. Place fire extinguishers in appropriate places, such as the kitchen. Train staff to use fire extingu ishers. Have fire extinguishers serviced periodically. Teach everyone in the home what to do if a fire occurs (e.g., safely exiting the home). Check to see that windows in bedrooms are not more than 44 inches above the floor to allow for egress. Do not all ow smoking in bed. Even better, do not allow smoking in the house. Do not leave matches or lighters around. Set all cigarettes \u2014smoked inside or outside the home \u2014in an ashtray. Dispose of cigarette butts in a tin can with sand. Be careful not to empty this can just after burying a cigarette butt in the sand. Clean ovens and fireplaces on a regular basis. Do not overload electrical circuits. Do not use extension cords running under rugs. Repair frayed or shredded electrical cords immediately. Use extreme care with space heaters. Be sure the circuit is sized to handle the heater. Do not let rubbish (especially paper, rags, and old clothes) accumulate under stairs, in the attic, or in the basement. Keep flammable liquids in tightly closed metal containers, away from heat sources. Store any rags used to wipe up oil or paint in a tightly closed metal containers, or submerge them in water and dispose of them quickly. Responding to a Fire Become acquainted with and use the prevention services of local fire departments. The fire department is available to review evacuation plans. Using a Fire Extinguisher Before using your fire extinguisher, be sure to read the instructions carefully. Although there are many different types of fire extinguishers, all of them operate in a similar manner. Use this acronym as a quick reference: P.A.S.S. Pull the Pin at the top of the extinguisher. The pin releases a locking mechanism and will allow you to discharge the extinguisher. Aim at the base of the fire, not the flames. This is important. In order to put out the fire, you must extinguish the fuel. Squeeze the lever slowly. This will release the extinguishing agent in the extinguisher. If the handle is released, the discharge will stop. Sweep from side to side. Using a sweeping motion, move the fire extinguisher back and forth until the fire is completely out. Operate the extinguisher from a safe distance, several feet away, and then move towards the fire once it starts to diminish. Be sure to read the instructions on your fire e xtinguisher. Different fire extinguishers recommend operating them from different distances. Remember: aim at the base of the fire, not at the flames!!!! What to Do If You Smell Smoke or Discover a Fire Having a plan and practicing the plan is critical. A Disaster Plan should be simple. In an emergency, stay calm and take specific actions. In case of fire: Ensure that the individuals in the home are safe by immediately assisting them leave the home as fast as possible, and go to the designated meeting place. Do not stop to get any belongings. Once out, STAY OUT. Never go back into a burning building for any reason. If someone is missing, tell the firefighters. Call 9- 1-1 from a neighbor's house or cell phone. If there is smoke in the room, stay low or c rawl to your exit. If you can't escape, put wet cloth, bath towels or fabric around doors to block off smoke. Crawl to a window and open it. Yell out the window for help and wave a sheet or cloth for attention. If there is a phone in the room, call for hel p. Fire Drills, Preparation and Planning Fire drills are required regularly and results documented. In preparation for drills, or in addition to drills, a lot of valuable teaching and learning is possible. Here are some things to teach individuals living in your home: Reacting to an alarm by exiting along a path that avoids the fire Remaining calm and walking, crawling, or wheeling out of the house Going to an agreed -upon meeting point, such as the edge of the street in front of the neighbor's house in or der to be accounted for Homes Must Have Fire Escape Plans Here are some things that belong in the plan: Floor plans, showing escape routes. A rendezvous point that is outside the home and away from danger. Specific roles and responsibilities of ISS staffs and residents. Location of multi -purpose, labeled \"A -B-C\" fire extinguishers. An \"A -B-C\" fire can be used on fires: wood; cloth and paper; oil; gas; kerosene; and electrical fires. Other types of fire extinguishers work only on c ertain types of fires. Awareness of gas leaks. Call the gas company and get out of the house if you smell gas. Taking care with all electrical appliances and make sure they are in good working condition (hair curling iron, toaster, irons, or space heaters) . Proper wattage bulbs in lamps. Fire extinguishers have a role if a fire is small and can be readily contained, but it is important for staff to follow fire escape plans. Practicing these plans should be a regular and frequent exercise for both staff and residents. Drills should be scheduled to cover various shifts, and some should occur when individuals and staff are inconvenienced (in bed, taking a shower). The more practice individuals have, the more likely they will act responsibly and safely in the e vent of a real emergency. RISK MANAGEMENT Your role in risk management is to actively promote practices that will keep individuals safe. Whenever possible, anticipate risks that may exist for individuals and prevent them from happening. Risk management i s something that, even now, you do every day. For example, when you get in a car, you put on your safety belt because you know that this will reasonably reduce your risk of injury or death in case of an accident. The whole purpose of risk management is to anticipate potential risks and to develop individualized strategies to reduce the risk. The following principles are basic to your practice of risk management: 1. Prevention of serious incidents is the number one priority. The best possible risk management strategy is to anticipate risks and prevent them from happening. As ISS staff, your first priority is to prevent injury or harm to individuals you support and to protect them from abuse, neglect, and exploitation. 2. Creation and maintenance of safe environments is everyone's responsibility. We are all responsible for looking out for risks and making environments safer. If you see a rake left where someone could trip over it, put it away. If there is water on the floor that might cause someone t o slip, wipe it up. Again, you need to anticipate risks and prevent accidents from happening. 3. Open communication is key to prevention. Open communication and sharing of information is key to identifying risks and ensuring safety. Everyone may have impo rtant information about potential risks and how to address them. 4. All who are required to report incidents, including ISS staff, are competent to respond to, report, and document incidents in a timely and accurate manner. ISS staff must report it accura tely and in a timely manner. 5. Ongoing identification, assessment, and planning for both potential risks and actual occurrences are essential to the development of sound, person -centered strategies to prevent or mitigate serious incidents. Risk managemen t is a never -ending process of identification, assessment planning, and evaluation of results. 6. Safety starts with those who work most closely with individuals receiving support and services. In your role as an ISS staff, you work day -today, hour -to-hour, and minute -to minute with individuals with developmental disabilities. You see things first and are in a position to anticipate risks early, before an accident or injury occurs. You have a unique responsibility in supporting quality of life f or individuals and ensuring their health and safety. Remember: Prevention is the number one priority! Identifying Risk Risk is a normal part of our lives. Many situations involve a certain amount of risk. For example: deciding whether or not to bring an umbrella in the morning because you might get wet if it rains. You can't do anything about the weather, but you can anticipate it and protect yourself. In deciding, you could watch the TV weather report, read the paper, or go on the Internet to find out we ather predictions for the day. Based on this information, you could decide whether or not you need to carry an umbrella. The fact is we already practice risk management in our own lives. The following section covers the types of risks \u2014including health ris ks\u2014related to functional abilities, challenging behavior, environmental risks, and lifestyle choices that you may identify in the lives of individuals you support. Health Risks If you were told that you had diabetes, you would most likely do everything yo u could to learn about the disease and its treatment and take whatever steps necessary to minimize the effects or risks associated with it. You would probably check your blood sugar regularly, watch your diet, and follow doctor's orders. In this example, you identified a health risk and then took actions to mitigate that risk. To mitigate risk means to lessen its effects. You may not be able to totally prevent a risk, but you can lessen its effects and improve an individual's quality of life. The individual 's planning team is always a good resource in planning health related risk prevention and mitigation strategies to protect the individual. Daily Living An individual may be at increased risk related to daily living skills. For example, an individual may b e at increased risk because of difficulty swallowing, lack of mobility, inability to transfer, or other functional challenges. Once again, the individual's planning team is a good resource in planning risk prevention and mitigation strategies to protect th e individual. Behavior Challenges An individual might be at an increased risk because of aggressive behavior where he or she might cause injury to himself or others. Environmental Risks If you find that your home has faulty electrical wiring, and the c ircuit breakers are blowing daily, you should get it repaired immediately. If the smoke detector has been disconnected because it sounds every time you cook, you need to reconnect it or relocate it immediately. Icy walks, broken seat belts, lack of handrai ls, and many other environmental conditions are all opportunities to practice risk management, either by preventing or mitigating the risk. Risks Resulting from Lifestyle Choices Risk can be greatly increased or decreased by certain lifestyle choices. High -risk behaviors such as driving in heavy traffic, riding a bicycle without a helmet, or walking alone in unfamiliar neighborhoods after dark are lifestyle choices. Practicing unsafe sex carries a high risk. Alcohol and drug abuse are other examples of lifestyle choices that increase an individual's risk. Once again, risks associated with these activities may be either prevented or mitigated through the application of risk management practices. Risk Assessment and Planning Once you have identified a ris k, the next step is to gather more information about that risk and develop a plan to mitigate the risk. This is called risk assessment and planning. Risk identification, assessment, and planning are all components of risk management that you do every day. When something happens, you are doing risk assessment when you ask yourself: \"What happened?\" did others observe or do?\" When you start to think about the future and ho w to prevent an incident from happening again, you are doing risk management planning. You might ask, \"What can I do to pr event it from happening again?\" Or, if it has happened before, \"What did I do last time, and did it work?\" \"Who else do I need to get help from?\" \"Is this something that the planning team needs to assist with?\" This last question is important, especially for those individuals who are at increased risk because of multiple health problems or who have challenging behaviors that put themselves or others at risk. And lastly, \"What is my next step?\" In your role as DSP staff, you have continuous opportunities to do risk assessment and to develop and implement risk prevention and mitigation strategies to ensure safety. The purpose of any risk assessment process is to: anticipate and identify potential risks; decide who else needs to be involved in helping to assess the potential risk (often the planning team); learn more about the type and degree of risk(s); and develop appropriate interventions to minimize potential harm and injury. Safety Is About Awareness and Preve ntion Safety means creating and then maintaining a hazard free environment by always doing things in a correct and careful manner; however, accidents happen. Is there some way to prevent them? It is important to assess situations so we can anticipate probl ems before they occur and brainstorm strategies to mitigate possible hazards. Preventing serious incidents is a high priority for all ISS staff. You can prevent accidents and, if they do occur, manage them in a way that minimizes injury to both you and the individual(s) you support. Practices that reduce the risk of injury: Being aware of what makes for a safe environment and creating and maintaining one Knowing and practicing the principles of risk management Securing medications and toxic substances Having good lighting Ensuring adequate room to move and eliminating tight spaces or pinch points Eliminating any tripping hazards Always practicing proper body mechanics when lifting Using proper wheelchair mobility techniques Sharing information about haz ards Knowing and practicing emergency contingency plans Knowing First Aid & CPR Falls Falls commonly occur on flights of stairs, ladders, chairs and stools, roofs, and when getting in and out of bathtubs. Some falls are caused by individuals who step on a n unseen object, such as marbles or a skateboard. Individuals of all ages fall out of bed or fall while getting out of bed. One of every four falls takes place on a level surface. Falls are caused frequently by carelessness. Some people just trip. Others a re in too much of a hurry, playing roughly, or don't see an object before they fall over it. Some falls are caused by health problems such as fainting, poor eyesight, hypertension, osteoporosis of the hip, or overmedication. Sometimes people fall when they are assisting others. The individuals you support are at an increased risk of falling and of suffering injury due to their disabilities, medication, and/or health problems. Individuals with a seizure disorder sometimes experience hard falls that result i n injuries during their seizures. Similarly, poor coordination and muscle control associated with cerebral palsy can cause someone to fall, especially when the individual has a wobbly or unsteady gait. Ways to Prevent Falls: Identify individuals at risk f or falling and document fall precautions in the IISP. Be sure individuals needing assistive devices (canes, walkers) use them and store them properly. Keep cords, wires, and hoses out of walkways. Make sure adequate staff are available when an individual i s physically lifted from one place to another, and make sure there is enough space. Provide handrails and guard rails at all elevated walkways or stairs. Use safety adaptations in the shower, such as a rubber mat in the bathtub or shower stall, a shower bench when the individual is unsteady or not well coordinated, or grab bars in the bathtub or shower stall. Keep the floors dry and clutter free. Install nightlights in bedrooms, halls, and bathrooms. Be sure nothing (clothes, toys, books) is left on stair ways or on the floor. Use non -skid matting under floor rugs. Carpet stairs and put a rubber runner on stairs to basement. Replace worn out carpet and make sure it doesn't come loose.

Frequent, thorough hand washing is crucial. It is a fact that more germs are spread through hands and fingers than anything else. Procedure : Make sure you have everything you need at the sink (liquid soap, paper towels, trash can ). Using warm water and soap, wash hands and wrists by rubbing palms together and lathering to produce friction. Scrub between fingers & entire surface of hands & wrists. Rinse hands and wrists, while pointing fingers down. Dry hands with a clean towel. Do not shake hands or touch the sink with your clean hands. Use a clean, dry paper towel or your elbow to turn off the faucet. Wash hands before: putting gloves on using cooking utensils, assisting with medication, blowing your nose, and touching someone with open sores. Wash hands after: taking gloves off, sneezing, coughing or blowing your nose, using the bathroom, assisting with soiled linens or bodily fluid. HAND WASHING Providing support for daily hygiene tasks, as well as helping to create and/or sustain healthy daily habits is extremely important to supporting an individual 's quality of life. Success in this important role provides support for all six of the service gui delines. Daily Tasks: Daily bath or shower Teeth are brushed and flossed daily Ears cleaned daily Deodorant is applied Clothing is seasonal, neat, clean and stylish (according to individual preference) Hair is brushed, clean, neat, and styled according to the individual 's preference (professional styling would also occur on a regular basis) Men 's faces are shaved or well-trimmed Women 's menses needs are attended to properly Ensure people are wearing sunscreen (re -apply every 2 hours) Following routines & providing concise documentation to illustrate potential problems DAILY CARE Assisting with bathing can be a very sensitive personal care activity for both the individual receiving services as well as the DSP assisting. It is especially important that you go to great lengths to be respectful, help the individual you support to feel safe and at ease, and to provide the greatest amount of privacy possible. Bathing Tips: Always wear gloves Wash and dry gently, even more so under skin folds and in other sensitive areas Start from top to bottom, work from front to back Rinse well and pat dry rather than rubbing Take the opportunity to observe the condition of skin & check for skin tears, pressure sores, etc. Follow agency policy to ensure bath or shower temp is safe Be familiar with seizure protocols - drowning can occur in 2 inches of water Speak to the individual as you assist, informing them of what you 're doing during each step before each step BATHING You may overse the mouth care (oral hygiene) for individuals who have different kinds of special needs. Prevention is the #1 priority. Maintaining dental health means the person can avoid cav ities, gum infections, pain, and to oth loss. Dental health also helps us to be able to chew with ease and enjoy a wide variety of foods and feel good about the way he or she looks. Oral Care Tips: Avoid too much paste when brushing or too much fluid when using mouthwash Encourage/ assist with brushing after meals and before bed Encourage/ assist with flossing daily Oral care is important even if the person doesn't eat or drink Always wear gloves If assisting with dentures, be certain to gently remove them and brush on all surfaces. After brushing, rinse them well in cool water an d place in a clean denture cup with solution and water Foot care is especially important to prevent germs and fungus from growing. Athlete's foot, a fungus that causes inflammation, cracking, and peeli ng of the skin between the toes, can also infect the toenails, and is of particular concern. If it appears, it must be dealt with immediately with the help of a professional. Individuals with d iabetes may have to hav e their foot care done by a professional. Foot Care Tips: Ensure shoes fit correctly and provide good support To avoid odor wear clean socks and if needed, use foot spray Don't walk barefoot in public showers Watch for plantar warts, ingrown toenails, corns, or athlete's foot Immediately report to a supervisor if fungus is noticed. People with diabetes must see a podiatrist. Always wear gloves Clean and trimmed fingernails are important for health and well -being. As is true with all personal ca re tasks, encourage and instruct in self -care when appropriate and assist as needed. Nail Care Tips: Ensure finger nails are cleaned daily and trimmed weekly Never share nail care items When requested, assist with scheduling professional care services such as haircuts, manicures and pedicures. Ensure proper nail care tools are purchased and kept clean (clippers, file, nail brush, etc.) Work with your team to provide alternatives to nail biting Allow fingers to soak in water prior to clipping or buffi ng Use a file and/or nail buffer instead of clippers when needed NAIL CARE ORAL HYGIENE FOOT CARE You may oversee or provide the mouth care (oral hygiene) for individuals who have different kinds of special needs. Prevention is the #1 priority. Maintaining dental health means the person can avoid cav ities, gum infections, pain, and to oth loss. Dental health also helps us to be able to chew with ease and enjoy a wide variety of foods and feel good about the way he or she looks. Oral Care Tips: Avoid too much paste when brushing or too much fluid when using mouthwash Encourage/ assist with brushing after meals and before bed Encourage/ assist with flossing daily Oral care is important even if the person doesn't eat or drink Always wear gloves If assisting with dentures, be certain to gently remove them and brush on all surfaces. After brushing, rinse them well in cool water and place in a clean denture cup with solution and water Toileting is a very private matter. A reassuring attitude from you can help lessen feelings of embarrassment for the individual. Some of the tasks you may be assisting with include: Cueing and reminding Assisting the indi vidual to and from the bathroom Assisting the individual transfer on and off and use the toilet or assistive equipment Undoing an individual's clothing, pulling down clothing, and refastening clothing Pericare Emptying the bedpan, urinal, or commode into the toilet Assisting with pads, briefs, or moisture barrier cream Here are some important tips when assisting with toileting needs: Always wear gloves Encourage/assist with hand washing when completed Enclose used brief in a plastic bag and discard in outside trash to help keep bathrooms pleasant Quietly, politely, and with a verbal acknowledgment, check briefs hourly Change wet or soiled clothing and bedding immediately Wipe from front to back and clean thoroughly to avoid rashes or infections Check on those using the commode every 5 min. After 10 min. suggest trying again later Ensuring adequate fiber and liquid intake promotes healthy eliminations Following routines & concise documentation illustrate potential problems Skin breakdown is a serious and constant concern for individuals who use wheelchairs and/or who do not change positions. Pressure sores are skin breakdown over bony spots such as tailbone and hips. Individuals who use wheelchairs and/or people with mobility challenges are at high risk for skin breakdown. Reference your agency policies or protocols for individuals who are at risk. Understanding Skin breakdowns: Some skin problems are very serious. Others are uncomfortable but can grow more serious over time. Athlete's foot ( are very common fungal infections that can cause skin breakdown. Like bacteria, fungi grow best in warm, moist areas of the skin, such as between the toes or in the groin. Ways to prevent skin breakdown: Frequently moving and/or changing positions Keeping the skin dry and clean Fungus problems can be prevented by thorough drying of skin; wearing sandals or shoes that breathe; wearing cotton underclothes and socks; and using talcum powder. Some skin problems can be prevented or at least minimized through diet, proper clothing, an d other actions. Assisting with drying sensitive areas such as groin, toes and under skin flaps Some skin problems may be spread by contact, so remember to use hand washing and other infection control techniques. What to do if skin breakdown occurs: Make sure the individual is examined by a health care professional immediately. Always seek advice and treatment from the individual's health care professional when new problems arise or the existing problem continues PRESSURE SORES ASSISTING W ITH ELIMINATIONS Chapter 12 Personal Care Formal Skills to pass the Certification Exam As a Direct support Professional staff in Supported Living you are most likely not required to take the Prometrics certification exam for Home Care Aids. If you work in a Group Home for other settings and you are not certain if you need to take the exam, please ask your supervisor. If you have to take the exam you have 200 days to complete the certificati on requirements. You may visit the Prometrics website for additional information and check lists to assist you with the process. Your agency cannot pay for your certification. IT is recommended that you google the Prometrics site for Washington State to ensure that the information you receive is current. There is a study guide at the end of your toolkit to help you prepare for the exam. Ask your agency if they offer a refreshe r course or if they can help you locate an agency that does. It is recommende d that you take a refresher course on the skills prior to taking the exam. Personal Care Ethics Observe the following professional ethics every time you assist and support an individual with personal care skills: Respect Respect the individuals you support and help others recognize their value. Personal care should be provided with dignity and respect for the individual. Physical and Emotional Well -Being Support individuals while being attentive to reducing their risk of harm. Personal care should be provided safely and in a way that promotes the physical and emotional well -being of the individual. Confidentiality Protect and respect the confidentiality and privacy of the individuals you support. An individual has the legal right to have his or her support needs kept confidential and to have privacy during personal care activities. It is imperative that you provide maximum privacy for these very personal hygiene tasks. Responsibility Be a partner to the individuals you support in order to facilitat e good personal care and promote health. Self-Determination Assist individuals in living the kind of life they choose. Individuals have the right to direct how personal care is provided. Assist the person you support in directing their personal care. Part of your job as a DSP is to support individuals so they can be as independent as possible. Some individuals may be able to bathe, shave, dress, and otherwise take care of themselves with no support. Others may need assistance or support to complete all or portions of their personal care activities. Depending on the abilities of each individual, you will need to provide more or less support. Having opportunities to make choices is a ke y to leading a healthy, happy life. Just as individuals have the opportuni ty to make choices about what clothes to wear and what to eat, the individual needs to have the choice as to how and when they complete their personal care activities. For example: one individual might like to bathe at night, while another likes to shower in the morning. Be aware of these individual preferences and support them. Right of Refusal The individuals you support have the right to refuse. Typically, if this is a periodic event, you would just document the ref usal in the person's file. If it is an ongoing issue, or a matter of health and safety, support strategies will be documented in the person's plan. Be certain to provide a great deal of power and choice in all areas of an individual's daily life. Doing so wi ll lessen the likelihood that they w ill make unhealthy and unhelpful hygiene choices to assert their power and choice. Mobility, Lifting and Transferring Sometimes, we have to support individuals in walking, going upstairs, or transferring from a bed to a wheelchair. Keep these things in m ind when assisting in any of these tasks. Walking Clarify where the individual would like to walk to Encourage the individual to wear non- skid footwear Avoid clothing that can get in the way Be certain the area is free from clutter Be patient and slow Assisting from sitting to standing Encourage the individual to lean forward; Help them to use a rocking motion as momentum (if able); if on a bed, help them move his/her legs off the bed; Have them push forward with his/her arms from the bed (if able). Keep the individual's body as straight as possible while attempting to stand If an individual has a weak leg, brace your knee against it as the individual stands. A gait belt can be used for stability Stand a few moments and stabilize his/her balance before walking Assisting on stairs The individual should step up with his/her stronger leg first Stand behind the individual when he/she is going up stairs The individual should step down with the weaker leg Stand in front or at the side of the individual when he/she is going down stairs For safety, the individual should always use a handrail Safe Lifting Practices Safe lifting and transferring techniques are important to preventing injury to the individual and yourself. Assisting another person to move can put a great deal of strain on your body unless you practice the proper strategies and body mechanics. No matter how light an item is, observing following guidelines for lifting or moving objects can help protect your back when you have to lift, push, or reac h for something: Use wheeled devices to move an object whenever possible. Push (don't pull) items such as a garbage container or a cart. Move to the item, rather than reaching for it. Squat, rather than bend over, to reach down for something. Turn, rather than twist, to go in a different direction. Twisting motions, especially with a heavy load, place considerable stress on the spine. Keep the natural curve of the spine intact. Lift items at about waist height Keep items close to your body and not away from your body Use a gait belt whenever possible Shaving Shaving one's legs, underarms, or face is a very personal matter. Cultural differences may be a key to whether an individual chooses to shave. In some cultures, women do not shave their legs or underarms; in some cultures, men do not shave their facial hair. It is important to assist and support the individual to shave safely and to avoid nicks and cuts that can lead to infection. Some individuals may learn to use an electric razor. Other individ uals may be assisted and supported in using a blade razor. It is important to ensure that each person have his/her own razor that is not shared. Face Shaving Tips: 1. Always wear gloves. 2. Ask individual if he wears dentures. If so, make sure they a re in his mouth. 3. Wash face with warm, wet washcloth to open pores and soften skin. 4. Hold skin taut with free hand and shave with smooth even movements in the direction of hair. 5. Rinse safety razor in warm water between strokes to keep the razor c lean and wet. 6. Shave sides first, then nose and mouth. 125 Confidentiality (HIPAA) As a result of participating in this segment of training, you will be able to: 1. Give a definition for HIPAA 2.

Guardian of Estate Guardian of Person Guardian of person & Limited Guardian CO- GUARDIAN Standby Guardian Full Guardianship of of both person and estate Responsible for non-financial decisions such as medical matters, living arrangements , and consent to habilitation plans No decision making authority unless primary guardian is unavailable (usually in an emergency) Responsible for financial and estate matters When tw o persons share decision making responsibility equally; c an be of person, estate or both As a DSP, what is my role to safeguard the information of the individuals I support? RELEASE OF INFORMATION I hereby authorize all medical service sources and health care providers to use and/or disclose the protected health information (''PHI'') described below to following individual: NAME _______ _____________ RELATIONSHIP _____________ Release of PHI covering health care for the period of (choose one) From (date) _______________ to (date) _______________, or All p ast, present and future periods I hereby authorize the release of PHI as follows (check one): my complete health record (including records relating to mental health care, communicable diseases, HIV or AIDS, and t reatment of alcohol/drug abuse), or my complete health record with the exception of the fo llowing information (check as appropriate): Mental health records Communicable diseases (including HIV/AIDS) Drug and alcohol treatment Other (specify) ______________________________ Signature ______________________________________________ Printed Name ___________________________ ________________ Date ___________________________ NSA Representative (Necessary Supplemental Accommodation) A Necess ary Supplemental Accommodation r epresentative is a person identified by an individual to DDA when the individual does not have a legal guardian and the individual is requesting or receiving DDA services. The only representatives that have any legal responsibility for the individual are natural, step, or adoptive parents who have custody of the individual who is under the age of ei ghteen; or court appointed legal guardians for individuals of any age. So... what is an NSA? HIPAA/Confidentiality Formatted: Font: 14 Chap ter Confidentiality (HIPAA) HIPAA HIPAA stands for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It was passed in 1996 to protect a patient's health information and ensure confidentiality. You will maintain confidentiality of individual records and will not disclose individual information other than for treatment, payment, and agency operations without the specific, informed consent of the individual, his/her legal representative, his/her parent if a minor child, or pursuant to court order, except as authorized by law or permitted by the individual. Each agency has developed a plan for the systematic retent ion and disposition of all records, including the disposal of obsolete, inactive, semi -active, and archival records as required under Chapter 40.14 RCW. Each agency will review its own policy on Confidentiality and HIPAA policy that includes the use of ext ernal resources (e.g. telephone, email, fax, texting, etc.) and the ability to properly execute the policies and procedures surrounding confidential information. Protected Information Confidential information is information identifiable to any person, including, but not limited to: an individual's name; health; finances; education; business; other activities; addresses; telephone numbers; social security numbers; driver's license numbers; and other identifying numbers or information. Individuals receiving services have the right to expect all of their personal information to be kept confidential. Programs should only collect and maintain information/data that is genuinely needed. Personal information, which is protected by confidentiality, includes far more than the pieces of paper in a file. It includes any verbal information that might be shared regarding an individual. Discussions and conversations about the individual must occur only in the context of your s upport for them and only with persons for whom you have permission to share such information or have a need to know in order to perform their job duties... Guardianships Guardianship is a legal proceeding in which a court determines that someone is unable to manage his or her personal or financial affairs. Upon making this determination the court delegates a person called a guardian to attend to the needs of the incapacitated person. Two written documents provide the necessary written proof of guardianship: a Guardianship Order and a Letter. The Order indicates the scope of the guardian's authority and the Letters indicate the timeframe of the guardianship. Letters are current if they have a renewal date that has not passed or if they are perpetual. A Guardian of an Estate is responsible for financial and estate matters only. A Guardian of Person is responsible for all non -financial decisions such as medical matters, living arrangements, consent to habilitation plans and comparable matters. A Guardian of Est ate and Person is responsible for both person and estate. Co -guardians share decision making responsibilities equally. It can be of either Person, Estate or both. A Standby Guardian has no decision making authority unless the primary guardian is unavailabl e (usually when emergency health care decisions must be made). A Limited Guardianship is when the court chooses to let an incapacitated person retain specific rights they are capable of exercising on their own. These rights must be specifically stated in t he court order. NSA Representative (Necessary Supplemental Accommodation) State law and Developmental Disabilities Administration rules require that written notice of all correspondence including decisions affecting DDA eligibility, services and choice of provider be sent to the individual and at least one other person. This person is referred to as the NSA representative. The NSA person receives copies of DDA planned action notices and other department correspondence to help an individual understand the documents and exercise their rights. The representative is identified by an individual to DDA when the individual does not have a legal guardian and the individual is requesting or receiving DDA services. The only representatives that have any legal resp onsibility for the individual are natural, step, or adoptive parents who have custody of the individual who is under the age of eighteen; or court appointed legal guardians for individuals of any age. Your Responsibilities It is essential that you hold al l of this information in strict confidence . This means that you cannot share any of this information with anyone outside of other employees working with the individual unless you have explicit written consent to do so. There are some entities, such as federal or state agencies, which may be an exception to this. To ensure that you are always in compliance, it is best for you to refer any requests to your supervisor. This also applies to sharing information with your friends or family. Personal information regarding the people you support should never be shared. Picture taking or videotaping for personal use is also prohibited (e.g., cell phones, social networki ng platforms, etc.). Use of pictures or videotaping for agency purposes requires signed consent. When discussing issues regarding an individual, please ensure that you do so in a private area and that you are aware of others who may be listening. Never discuss one person's information in front of another individual, even if you believe they are not li stening or do not understand. Maintaining confidentiality requires you to keep communication and information physically secure and in a secure area. Physically secure means that access is restricted through physical means to authorized individuals only. S ecured area means an area to which only authorized representatives of the agency possessing the confidential information have access. Secured areas may include buildings, rooms, or locked storage containers \u2014such as a filing cabinet within a room \u2014as long as access to the confidential information is not available to unauthorized personnel. It is your responsibility to know your company's policies for protecting and disposing of protecting information - both information that is on paper as well as digital inf ormation. If you are not sure, it is your job to find out. Like many laws, \"not knowing\" is never a defense for not adhering to the law.
