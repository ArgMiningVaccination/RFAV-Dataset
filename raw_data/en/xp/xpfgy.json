What is Anthroposophical Nursing? This is an integrated approach, which extends modern and traditional nursing practice, providing a range of modalities to support the healing process. Anthroposophy or the Science of the Spirit (founded by Rudolf Steiner 1861 - 1925) provides a deep understanding at the nature of the human being based on the belief that we are more than a physical organism. That we are permeated with life forces, an emotional 'body' of soul, and a unique sense of self which is an expression of Spirit. Health and illness are bound up with the balance of these 4 'sheaths' and this nursing approach works out of this understanding to support a balance through external applications. The nurse carries herself with an Intention to bring Light and Warmth into her work with each patient, thus 'walking beside' them in their journey. What does Anthroposophical Nursing offer? Assistance towards achieving balance, wellbeing and health. As a Registered Nurse having completed a Graduate Certificate in Anthroposophical Nursing, I am deeply committed to providing holistic health care, supported by a sound knowledge and experience in conventional practice. This approach supports the individual on their journey and helps to restore health. It also has its place in preventative health care. Who can benefit from Anthroposophical Nursing Therapies?
