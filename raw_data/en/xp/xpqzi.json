The study hypothesis is that the altered B-cell surface markers are related to CVID, and not to the complications or treatment of CVID. | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |Yes| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Observational| |Eligible Ages||18 Years and Over| |Gender||All| | Trial ID: | This trial id was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providing information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants with locations in all 50 States and in 196 countries. | | Phase 1: Studies that emphasize safety and how the drug is metabolized and excreted in humans. Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use. The sponsor is the organization or person who oversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyzing the study data. The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. Category of organization(s) involved as sponsor (and collaborator) supporting the trial. The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID) is a syndrome containing a spectrum of disorders which results in weakened immunity and recurrent infections. The ESID (European Society for Immunodeficiencies) CVID definition includes patients with marked decrease of IgG (at least 2 standard deviations below the mean for age). Patients must also have disease onset at an age over 2 years, absent isohaemagglutinins and/or response to vaccines and other defined causes of hypogammaglobulinaemia must be excluded. The Euroclass system of classifying CVID is the result of a European multicentre trial attempting to develop a consensus of two existing classification schemes of B-cell immunophenotyping. In this paper it was shown that B-cell immunophenotype correlated with coincidence of clinical sequelae and it suggested implementing this to further classify CVID to give prognostic and therapeutic information. However, it has not yet been shown that these alterations in B-cell immunophenotype are the result of CVID itself and not caused by the treatment or complications of CVID (e.g. immunoglobulin replacement therapy, granulomatous disease, bronchiectasis). The aim of this study is to show that alterations in B-cell immunophenotype are caused by CVID itself and not by its complications or treatment. The study will therefore compare CVID patients to suitable control patients with granulomatous disease, bronchiectasis and on long-term immunoglobulin therapy. A control group of normal people will also be included to ensure the assay can detect normality and to show differences between normal people and patients with CVID. : CVID Patients with common variable immunodeficiency : CVID and granulomatous disease Patients with CVID complicated with granulomatous inflammation : CVID and bronchiectasis Patients with CVID complicated by bronchiectasis : Control on Immunoglobulin Patients on immunoglobulin long-term who do not have an immunodeficiency : Control bronchiectasis Controls with bronchiectasis not caused by a known immunodeficiency : Control with granulomatous disease Control patients with Crohn's Disease as this is a disease that causes granulomatous inflammation. : Healthy Controls If you are interested in learning more about this trial, find the trial site nearest to your location and contact the site coordinator via email or phone.
