A non-toxic perfume is simply a perfume that is free from any toxic ingredients such as synthetic alcohol, aroma chemicals that may harm you. They are typically made from natural ingredients using only aromatic materials that are directly extracted from natural flora and fauna. Non-toxic constituents include various types of natural extracts like essential oils, resins, absolutes, concretes, infusions, and tinctures of raw plant materials. Roots, flowers, stems, leaves, seeds, resins, and wood can be used efficiently to extract precious essences. Besides, non-toxic perfumes don\u00d6t contain harmful substances such as phthalates and parabens. Diverse types of animal pheromones have been used by perfumers for centuries and these animal scents also fall into the non-toxic and natural perfumes category. Some types of animal scents include civet, ambergris, and genuine musk which are used to live longer and more depth wear to the perfumes. Non-toxic perfumers often use animal essences while composing historical recipes. Other non-toxic perfumers work only with plant extracts, in which case they commonly call their products \"botanical perfumes\". These perfumes are usually harmless and vegan, as most small perfumers\u00d6 companies don\u00d6t test on animals.

How Non-toxic Perfumes are Made The major difference in making processes between synthetic and non-toxic perfumes lies in their components. The fundamental steps followed for manufacturing both types of perfumes are almost the same. Here\u00d6re some methods that are used in making non-toxic perfumes Extraction process The process of the extraction of oils from plant sources. Some popular extraction methods include solvent extraction, steam distillation, and enfleurage. - Steam distillation during [steam distillation](https://naturalnicheperfume.com/blog/street-distillation/)methods, parts of the plants such as roots or leaves are steamed in a place until the oils separate. - Solvent extraction in solvent extraction methods, the plant is dissolved in a solvent like alcohol. Then the container is rotated until or unless a waxy material is produced. Then the waxy material is put into ethyl alcohol, which helps to dissolve the oils. And ultimately the alcohol is evaporated leaving the perfume oil behind. - Enfleurage in enfleurage methods, perfumers spread flowers on a glass plate that is poured with odorless vegetable and animal fats. The fats soak up the flower scents. Blending process The second step is blending all the substances. The blending is done using water, alcohol, resins, coal tar, or other useful compounds. These substances are called [fixatives](https://naturalnicheperfume.com/blog/thoughts-from-timbuktu-fixatives/). They also give the final products a longer life. Aging process Aging is the final step in the production of perfumes. It usually takes months and sometimes years to study and take notes used in the perfumes to blend and create formulas.
