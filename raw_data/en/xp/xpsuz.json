Practitioners with the necessary knowledge and skills may participate in the presentation and discussion of health topics by means of public ad dresses or through the printed or electronic media to lay audiences, provided that no information about their standing is given which may imply that a practitioner is the only, the best, or the most experienced in his or her particular field. 3.

In such instances, practitioner s may not promote their own practices , but should instead only promote the profession, discuss associated general healthcare matters or policy and direct any patient enquiries to see a registered practitioner. M. FACEBOOK/OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION 1. The utiliz ation of any social media (not limited to so cial networks such as FACEBOOK) may take place within the provisions of the relevant laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations applicable to the professions registered under the AHPCSA. 2. The AHPCSA recognizes, and respects, that freedom of expression, an entrenched right within the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, is a necessary and fundamental tenet of democracy - this right is not absolute , however, and is therefore limited by the Constitution and oth er aspects of law. 3. Section 36 of the Bill of Rights provides for the limitation of a right to the extent that the limitation is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society, based on human di gnity, equality and freedom, taking into acco unt all relevant factors including among other things the nature of the right and the nature and extent of t he limitation. This limits the exercise of one's own right in terms of the constitution, while it promotes the prohibition of infringing on another person's rights. 4. No practitioner may interact on social networks in any manner which might be construed as defamatory or might fall into the lesser category of contumelia, or insult, either to other individual practitioners, to the profession as a who le or to the AHPCSA itself; these interactions infringe on the rights enjoyed by parties so affected. 5. Social media should never be used in a way that breaches any of the prescribed Code of Ethics, policies or regulations. Practitioners are prohibited f rom using social media to: (a) breach any of the prescribed policies, regulations or Code of Ethics; (b) breach obligations with respect to the rules and regulations of the AHPCSA or any other organization; (c) breach any obligations they may have relating to confidentiality; This gazette is also available free online at www.gpwonline.co.za STAATSKOERANT, 18 DESEMBER 2015 No. 39531 123 36 (d) defame or disparage the AHPCSA or any of its employees or members , practitioners or patients , suppliers, vendors or other stakeholders; (e) harass or bully any person in any way ; (f) unlawfully discriminate against any person ; and (g) breach any othe r laws or ethical standards (for example, never use social media in a false or misleading way, such as by claiming to be someone other than yourself or by making misleading statements). 7. Practitioners may not provide direct reference to another health care provider to any individual on any social media platforms. 8. Limitations on advertising have at the core the fiduciary relationship between a practitioner and the patient, with protection of the patient being the overriding principle; trust between the practitioner and patient is critical for the ultimate well - being of any patient. 9. The manner and extent of social media interaction also bears reflection within the paradigm of the Consumer Protection Act, 2008 (Act 68 of 2008). Any claims made by pract itioners on social media sites are also subject to the provisions of the Act and any other related legislation. 10. Interaction with any patient on any open web - or social media site accessible by the public or any other third party (other than the practitione r and consumer/patient) in a manner that is associated with the condition of that patient or constitutes medical advice is disallowed. 11. The ethical and legal duty to protect patient confidentiality applies equally on Internet as to other media. 12. Practitioners who post online have an ethical obligation to declare any conflicts of interest. 13. The AHPCSA advises practitioners not to accept as friends, followers or any other means of interaction, any patient onto any personal social media profile. 14. The AHPCSA furthe r advises that practitioners should be conscious of their online image and how it may impact on the ir professional standing or the professional standing of their profession. This gazette is also available free online at www.gpwonline.co.za124 No. 39531 GOVERNMENT GAZETTE, 18 DECEMBER 2015 37 N. GENERAL 1. Notifications concerning practitioners who stand in a relationship with private hospitals, clinics, gyms and health spas, must in all respects conform to these guidelines. 2. The C ouncil and/or the professional b oard retain the final authority for deciding on the acceptability, the content and format of notifications put out by practitioners. 3. Discipli nary cases pertaining to practitioners who are in breach of the guidelines for making professional services known, as contained in this document, will be dealt with in a manner that will result in the fina lisation of these cases within the shortest possible period of time. 4. In the case of uncertainty about the application of these guidelines or in the case of intended promotional action or notifications that are not covered within these guidelines, practi tioners should consult the C ouncil for appropriate guidance.
