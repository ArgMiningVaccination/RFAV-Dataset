Also as a prime member of Glob al Health Security Agenda, we should limit the international spread of diseases through capacity building and international collaboration. Diseases or public health risks due to events related to radio nuclear , chemical, biological and natural disast ers, which spread through PoE can pose a serious threat to our vulnerable population. This in turn can have long term impact on physical, mental & social health. Points of entry being multi- minist erial set up need collaborat ed response with intersectoral coordination. I take pride in introducing the manual titled 'Manual on Public Health Measur es for All Hazar d Appr oach under International Health Regulations (IHR) For Glob al Health Security ' which is written, keeping in view the operational problems faced by our technical manpow er which is posted at the International Points of Entry. This manual introduces an integrat ed approach to all hazar ds which can occur at PoE and contains all standar d operating procedur es which are easy to compr ehend by the technical staff. I hope that this manual will be a guide for technical training and correct implementation of Public Health Measur es. Dr. Jagdish Prasad PUBLIC HE ALTH- INTERNA ORATE GENERAL OF HE ALTH SERVICES MINISTR Y OF HE ALTH & F AMIL Y WELF ARE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA Preface The ever increasing International Trade and Traffic along with the advent of newer technology , has made this world a small place. The need to make world a safer place in terms of protection against infectious diseases, disast ers, poverty, etc is a primar y concern. A step in this direction is the Glob al Health Security Agenda, which acknowledges the essential need for a multilat eral and multi-sect oral approach to strengthen both the global capacity and nations' capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases threats. Legally abiding effor t in this direction is the International Health Regulations, with a wider scope to prevent and protect against and provide public health response to infectious diseases and disast ers, through international Points of Entries. Indian subcontinent is highly vulnerable to all types of natural and man- made disast ers. The current manual is an effor t to integrat e the existing guidelines into an all hazar ds approach for implementation at the international points of entries, in alignment with the International Health Regulations 2005 for Glob al Health Security . This manual has been put together with the effor ts of exper ts from various organizations who have been involved in various training courses. This manual will serve as handy technical guide for enabling health manpow er to take various public health measur es as per IHR particularly during chemical and radio-nuclear events. I congratulat e them and hope that this manual will serve as an impor tant guide in training of technical staff and conduct of duties.

Many of our International Points of entry (Airpor ts, Ports and Land Ports) are locat ed in zones that are vulnerable to natural and man- made hazar ds. Hazar d is defined as any danger ous phenomenon, substance, human activity , or condition that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, proper ty damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or envir onmental damage. The exposur e to hazar ds, the conditions of vulnerability that are present and insufficient capacity or measur es to reduce or cope with the potential negativ e consequences calls upon proactive, all hazar ds approach, especially , at International Points of entry. The response activities should be applicable to all types of hazar ds; major themes of response being, Early warning systems, evacuation of people and animals, search and rescue, medical care, drinking water supply , sanitation, food supply , communication, etc. This response requir es intersectoral coordination and collaboration. The earthquak e which hit Andaman Sea in 2004, led to large tsunami waves which affect ed the East Coast of India. Ports of Chennai, Vizag and Andaman and Nicob ar were worst affect ed. Many ships were damaged and got embedded in the sand. In Andaman the entire naval airpor t was swept away . India had cyclones; Hud Hud, Helen, Phailin which affect ed the Easter Ports. Airpor ts and seapor ts in the area were visibly damaged but the impact on the population was limited due to early prediction of cyclones and rescue to safe areas. Flash flooding of Ports and Airpor ts are rare events but the sudden Flash Flood which affect ed Chennai affect ed the lives of people of Chennai. Many of the houses, persons were swept away by the flood. Chennai Airpor t was flooded and flights were either diverted or took off from Airforce Port in Avadi. Some of the public health emer gencies of international concern (PHEIC) which haven't hit India (like Yellow fever, Ebola, MERS CoV and more recently Zika virus) but at the same time they have the potential to cause unprecedent ed damage. Points of Entry (PoE): International airpor ts, ports and ground crossings are requir ed to have health units for under taking public health measur es during routine times and specific measur es during the time of PHEIC (Public Health Emer gencies of international Concern). Consequent upon adoption of new International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) by 65th World Health Assembly , many specific functions are mandat ed for events related to ALL Hazar ds approach. IHR requir es all WHO member countries to have specific cor e cap acities (as per IHR) at all int ernational points o f entr y. Further, each member countr y is requir ed to notif y to WHO the list o f international por ts, airpor ts and gr ound cr ossings, wher e the specific core capacities have been developed (Designat ed Points of Entry). India is a member countr y of WHO and signat ory to International Health Regulations (2005). In view of this, the countr y has to be compliant with the IHR 2005 and develop specific core capacities for routine : 1 :measur es and for surveillance and response during PHEIC at all designat ed international points of entry (POEs). Basic aim of these organizations is to contr ol and prevent international spread of public health emer gency of international concerns in compliance to International Health regulations, vis-a- vis, Indian Aircraft (Public Health) Rules as well as Indian Port Health Rules. These organizations are functioning since more than 6 decades and have been under taking surveillance measur es against a number danger ous diseases like yellow fever, Ebola Disease fever, Swine flu, SARS etc. The role played by these Organizations during the plague outbr eak, DHF and recent pandemic of swine flu is enough evidence about the utility of these units in the overall interest of the countr y. In the past also, the APHOs and PHOs have played a significant role in preventing international spread of Plague in 1994 and SARS in 2003. Apart from this, these units are involved in keeping constant vigil towar ds preventing the impor t of yellow fever into the countr y which is a danger ous disease with high mortality and morbidity rate. The disease is presently prevalent in around 44 countries of African and South American continents and there is all likelihood of this disease being impor ted to India through mosquit oes and human traffic. The countr y is v ery much pr one t o the disease due t o conduciv e envir onmental conditions and susceptible hosts. As per the existing rules, any passenger , who does not have valid certificat e of vaccination against Yellow fever, coming from yellow fever infect ed counties are placed under quarantine for a period of 6 days. IHR (2005) also requir es the member countries to establish core capacities at all designat ed PoEs for taking surveillance and response measur es events due to chemical, radio-nuclear and natural disast er in addition to biological agents. Details of the routine and emer gency functions of these units (APHO & PHO) are detailed below . Box No. 1 FUNCTIONS OF APHOS/ PHOS Routine and Emergency Functions o f Airpor t Health Organizations (APHOs) and Land P ort Health Organizations (LPHOs): 1. Isolation and Quarantine work : The health screening of international passenger s. 2. Disinfection, disinsection and deratting of aircrafts. 3. Super vision of sanitation, drinking water supply , anti- mosquit o and anti- rodent work . 4. Dead body clearance. 5.

Provide medical facilities for Seamen such as for their pre-entr y and periodical examination for physical fitness. 11. Restriction against impor t of monk eys into India. Monk eys being most prone to be reservoir of yellow fever infection are not permitt ed to be brought to or transit ed through India. 12. Licensing of eating establishments within the local limits of ports as per the provisions of PFA Act, 1955. Additional functions of APHO/ PHO in view of expansion in the scope of IHR 2005 1.Coor dination with National Focal Points, DGHS, MOHFW and count erpart PoE in the event of a suspect ed PHEIC. 2.Development of Capacities (manpower) for surveillance for following events at PoEs: Chemical, Biological, Zoonotic and Radio-nuclear events. 3.Coor dination for timely response by development of Contingency plans for each PoEs by: Identification of Nodal persons at PoEs. Trainings at PoEs in abov e disciplines. Coor dination with the existing manpower and resour ces for responding to PHEIC. Upgradation of health units at International PoEs will help in strengthening global health security . The Glob al Health Security Agenda (GHSA) launched in Februar y 2014 has a vision of a world safe and secur e from infectious disease threats by prevention, rapid detection, transp arent repor ting and mitigation of outbr eaks through interconnect ed global network . Envisaged are full implementation of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Performance of Veterinar y Services (PVS) pathway , and other relevant global health security frameworks. GHSA has grown to include a number of countries around the world, including India. GHSA includes Eleven Action Packages which have been agreed upon by Action Package leader s and contributing countries, with the under standing that they may be changed or added to over time; Antimicr obial resistance, Zoonotic disease, Biosafety and Biosecurity ory ting, Workfor ce Development, Emer gency Operations Centr es, Linking Public Health with Law and Multi-sect oral Rapid Response and Medical Count ermeasur es and Personnel Deployment Action Package. In this manual we have included public health measur es and global security issues at International Points of entry related to Food safety , Vector borne diseases, Zoonosis, Chemical Accidents, Radionuclear accidents and Disast ers.

SURVEILL ANCE OF PROGRAMME (IDSP) Under IDSP data is collect ed on epidemic prone diseases on weekly basis (Monday-Sunday). The weekly data gives information on the disease trends and seasonality of diseases. In addition to the weekly data health events/media alerts are also repor ted on SOS basis by Media scanning units at Central Surveillance Unit/ State Surveillance units. Whenev er there is a rising trend of illnesses in any area, or in response to health events/ media alerts trained Rapid Response Teams (RRT) investigat es to diagnose and contr ol the event/ outbr eak. Events under surveillance at PoE 1.Events including Food/ Water borne illnesses occurring/r epor ted at POE 2. Events which constitut e potential PHEIC or PHEIC as declar ed by WHO Suspect ed cases of diseases with mandat ory notification t o WHO under Annex 2 o f IHR: For eg. Small po x, Poliomy elitis due t o wild type poliovirus, human influenza caused by a new subtype and Severe Acute Respirat ory Syndrome (SARS). Suspect ed cases of diseases that may lead to the use of IHR Annex 2: like Cholera, Pneumonic plague, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fever. 3.Deaths other than caused due to accident 4.Events that requir e rapid response, investigation, contact tracing, follow - up by IDSP. 5. Any other events as instruct ed by Ministr y/ Dte GHS/S tate. Type of surveillance: Due to rapid population turnov er and presence of interdisciplinar y teams including nonmedical staff, event based surveillance (EBS) will be appropriat e for capturing events and risks. Event Based Sur veillance: Event-b ased sur veillance is the or ganized and rapid captur e of information about events that are a potential risk to public health. This information can be rumour s and other ad-hoc repor ts transmitt ed through formal channels (i.e. Airpor t/ Land Port Health Authorities etc) and informal channels (i.e. media, personnel working at PoE etc), including: Events related to the occurr ence of disease in humans, such as clustered cases of a disease or syndr omes, unusual disease patterns or unexpect ed deaths as recognized by health work ers and other key informants in the premises of PoE; and Events related to potential exposur e for humans, such as events related to diseases and deaths in animals, contaminat ed food products or water, and envir onmental hazar ds including chemical and radio-nuclear events. Surveillance data flow between PoE and IDSP Information receiv ed through event-b ased surveillance should be rapidly assessed for the risk the event poses to public health and repor ted to State Surveillance Officer and responded to in coordination with District Health authorities/ District Surveillance Unit. : 8 :All the events placed under surveillance at all PoEs should be repor ted to State Surveillance Officer IDSP (Annexur e 2) in a designat ed format for First Information repor t (Annexur e 1) for the purpose of taking action, whenev er suspect ed. It will be responsibility of State Surveillance Officer to direct District Health Authorities (District Surveillance Officer) or appropriat e authority depending on the type of event for under taking rapid response and investigation. SSU/ DSU will also provide feedb ack to APHO/ LPHO and Central Surveillance Unit IDSP regarding action taken. : 9 :: 10 :Annexure 1 First Information R epor t for ev ents at P oE to be submitted to S tate Sur veillance Officer Date of repor ting Time o f repor ting Source of information of the event: Contact details of source of information: Description of the event Location of the event Population at risk Date of onset of sympt oms in first case Number of cases Clinical description Number of deaths Any samples taken, Description of samples and lab wher e samples sent.

Primar y food means an article of food, being a produce of agricultur e or horticultur e or animal husb andry and dairying or aquacultur e in its natural form, resulting from the growing, raising, cultiv ation, picking, harvesting, collection or catching in the hands of a person other than a farmer or fisherman. Safe Food (2) The general public might consider that 'safe food' means zero risk (no risk at all). Wher eas the food manufactur er would consider 'what is an acceptable risk?' The opinion expr essed is that zero risk is not feasible given the range of food products available, the complexity of the distribution chain and human natur e. Unfor tunat ely there is no public consensus on what constitut es an acceptable risk. A difficulty that arises in manufacturing 'safe' food is that the consumer is a mixed population with varying degrees of susceptibility and general life style. Food with high levels of preservatives to reduce microbial growth is undesirable by the consumer and perceived as 'over processed' with 'chemical additives' The consumer pressur e is for greater varieties of fresh and minimally processed foods, natural preservatives with a guarantee of absolute safety . Unsafe Food An article of food whose natur e, substance or quality is so affect ed as to render it injurious to health by:- (i) the article itself, or its package thereof, which is composed, whether wholly or in part, of poisonous or delet erious substance; or (ii) the article consisting, wholly or in part, of any filthy , putrid, rotten, decomposed or diseased animal substance or vegetable substance; or (iii) virtue of its unhy gienic processing or the presence in that article of any harmful substance; or (iv) the substitution of any inferior or cheaper substance whether wholly or in part; or (v) addition of a substance directly or as an ingredient which is not permitt ed; or (vi) the abstraction, wholly or in part, of any of its constituents; or (vii) the article being so colour ed, flavoured or coated, powdered or polished, as to damage or conceal the article or to make it appear better or of greater value than it really is; or : 12 :(viii) the presence of any colouring matter or preservatives other than that specified in respect thereof; or (ix)the article having been infect ed or infest ed with worms, weevils, or insects; or (x) virtue of its being prepared, packed or kept under insanitar y conditions; or (xi)virtue of its being mis-branded or sub-standar d or food containing extraneous matter; or (xii)virtue of containing pesticides and other contaminants in excess of quantities specified by regulations. HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIA TED WITH FOOD Food and water may be associat ed with certain hazar ds due to poor handling and storage conditions or sometimes due to certain inher ent food constituents. Potential health hazar ds associat ed with food are- Physical, Chemical, Biological and Radiological. PHYSICAL HAZARDOUS AGENTS IN FOOD AND WATER Physical hazar ds are hard foreign objects that can cause physical injury or illness to the consumer . Physical hazar d may be inher ent to the food or ingredient. For example chaff , straw and stalks in plant produce; bone fragment, feather and hair in meat products. They could be extraneous for example, metal, glass, stones, soil, dirt, jewellery parts, rodent hairs and excreta, human hair and nails, staple pins, iron filings, plastic p arts, wood, p aper, insects et c. Physical hazar ds ar e easily r ecognized by consumer s and do not need much exper t help to detect. HAZARDOUS AGENTS IN FOOD AND WATER Chemical hazar ds are toxic substances that are produced naturally , added intentionally , or un- intentionally . These include heavy metals, natural toxins, sanitizer s, pesticides, antibiotics and drugs. The origin of chemical hazar ds is: Agronomical : These include the residues of pesticides, fertilizer s, fungicides, antibiotics and growth hormones used on food crops. Natural food toxins: Chemicals or toxins produced by fish, shellfish toxins, mushr oom toxins. CHEMICAL : 13 :Toxins produced by infecting or ingested microbes: Toxins produced by algae or diatoms consumed by fish, mycot oxins produced by mould and bacterial growth. Food allergens : These are natural constituents, mainly proteins, of certain foods like egg, fish, milk, peanuts, sesame seeds, soybean, tree nuts and wheat gluten, and certain preservatives and additiv es like sulphit e. Factor y chemical residues : Chemicals used for cleaning and sanitizing food contact surfaces, pest contr ol chemicals, lubricants, coatings, paints, refrigerants and water treatment chemicals. BIOL OGICAL HAZARDOUS AGENTS IN FOOD AND WATER Food borne microbial infections and intoxications include a wide spectrum of illnesses that are a growing global public health risk. These diseases are caused by ingestion of foodstuffs contaminat ed with microorganisms or their toxic metabolit es. The contamination may occur at any stage during the process of harvesting, handling, transpor t, storage, processing, distribution, and consumption of food. Both acute and chronic clinical manifestations of food borne illnesses are known. The best known acute clinical presentation of food borne disease involves gastr ointestinal sympt oms. Some well-known ailments could be attribut ed to the following classes of parasit es and pathogens. Viruses Faecal contamination of food via water, soil or food handler s is repor ted to be the main cause of viral food borne diseases. Viral food borne diseases include hepatitis A (sympt oms include fever, weakness, nausea, and jaundice), Norwalk agent or Small Round Shaped virus (causes gastr ointestinal ailments like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pain, headache, and fever), Rotaviruses (cause diarrhoea in infants and young childr en). Bacteria Bacterial food borne diseases can be divided into two categories, food infections, and food poisoning, caused as a result of toxins produced by the microbes and its ingestion. Common bacteria that cause food borne infections include, Salmonella typhi , the enterotoxic, and enterohemorrahagic forms are the most virulent. Food poisoning is caused by the human ingestion of toxins produced by Staph ylococcus . Common rickettsia that are involved in foodborne infections include well known Coxiella burnetti , the cause of Q fever, Rickettsia prowazekii , the cause of typhus fever, and Rickettsia rickettsii, the cause of Rocky mountain spott ed fever Protozo a and parasites Several parasit es are known to cause foodborne and waterborne illnesses. These organisms live and reproduce within the tissues and organs of animal and human hosts, and are transmitt ed to humans through the contaminat ed food and water. Parasit es are of differ ent types and range in size, from single- celled microscopic organisms (protozo a), to large multi-cellular worms (helminthes) that may be seen without a microscope. Amoebic dysent ery is the most common ailment caused by Entamoeba histoly tica. The sympt oms include diarrhea, fever, chills, and liver abscess. Giardiasis caused by Giardia causes diarrhea with green stools. These diseases are caused by raw or mishandled food or contaminat ed water. . : 14 :Toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii causes mononucleosis and death. The disease is caused by consumption of raw under cook ed meat. Trichinella spiralis, cause of trichinellosis (also known as trichinosis ), is an intestinal roundworm whose larvae may migrat e from the digestiv e tract and form cysts in various muscles of the body . Infections occur worldwide, but are most prevalent in regions wher e pork or wild game is consumed raw or under cook ed. Taenia saginata and Taenia solium are parasitic helminthes. Taeniasis infection caused by adult-stage tapeworms. Yeasts, Moulds and Mycotoxins Their prolonged presence, particularly of the Mycotoxins producing moulds may lead to formation of Mycotoxins. Mycotoxins can appear in the food chain as a result of pre-har vest fungal infection of crops, or during posthar vest st orage, if conditions ar e conduciv e for fungal gr owth. Once formed Mycot oxins largely are difficult to eliminat e. So, they tend to remain in the food chain, and in meat and dairy products. Even drastic thermal treatments, such as cooking do not destr oy some Mycotoxins. Therefore, prevention of mould growth in pre-har vest and posthar vest stored crops is the best strategy to eliminat e Mycotoxins in food chain. RADIOL OGICAL HAZARDOUS AGENTS IN FOOD AND WATER Natural : All food and drinking water may contain some level of natural radio activity due to the presence of naturally occurring radionuclides like potassium-40, and radium-226. Manmade : Foods and water may get contaminat ed with radionuclides due to their release in envir onment from nuclear establishments and in large quantities from nuclear accidents. In case of nuclear accidents, reactor produced radionuclides such as Iodine-131, Cesium-137, Strontium-90, may find entry in food chain. Contamination of the food or feed with radionuclides may impact human or animal health and also become barrier to trade. Contamination of foods with radionuclide shall be as low as reasonably achiev able. Hazar dous substances can ent er at any point along the food chain, i.e. fr om farm wher e food is produced t o the consumer (Figur e no 2.1). Figure no. 2.1 Food chain and points o f entr y of hazardous substances. : 15 :RATIONALE All ports of entry should have surveillance and monit oring program for providing safe food for international travellers including food in transit. Food business operat ors should follow an established Food Safety Management System, use a HACCP Protocol to ensur e production of safe food. Further, It is essential that food service personnel protect the health of consumer s from food borne illnesses by practicing clean work habits and following acceptable sanitar y procedur es, ther eby, creating a sanitar y envir onment. STATUS Points of entry at airpor ts have lounges, food and snack outlets, hotels, food courts, major flight kitchens & food outlets for provision of food and snacks for the travellers. At Seapor ts there are mainly small food and snacks outlets providing food to port users.

FOOD BORNE DISE ASE OUT BREAK INVESTIGA TION Food borne disease outbr eaks are investigat ed to prevent both ongoing transmissions of disease and similar outbr eaks in the futur e. Impor tant considerations in investigating an outbr eak of infectious diseases include determining that outbr eak has in fact occurr ed and defining the extent of the population at risk, determining the measur e of spread and reservoir, and charact erizing the agent. The scale of an outbr eak may range from a local outbr eak of a small number of linked cases with mild disease to a nationwide or international outbr eak of severe disease involving the mobilization of public health resour ces from all levels irrespectiv e of the scale. A full investigation of a food borne disease outbr eak will normally include: - Epidemiological investigation -Envir onmental and food investigations -Laborat ory investigation STEPS IN OUTBRE AK INVESTIGA TION: Steps that are commonly used in investigating an outbr eak are listed below; however these may vary and differ in order, depending upon the outbr eak: 1.Define the Outbreak and validate the existence of Outbreak . Define the \"numerat or \"(cases) Clinical featur es: is the disease known? A case definition should be established through a set of criteria for determining whether a person should be classified as being affect ed by the disease under investigation. Figure no. 2.7 Ways in which pathogens are introduced into food by food handler s : 19 :: 20 :What does serology or cultur e repor ts indicat partially under stood? Define the \"denominat or\": what is the population at risk of developing disease? Determine whether the obser ved number of cases clearly exceeds the expect ed number Calculate the attack rate: No. of cases of a specified disease during specified time interval x 100 Total population at risk during same time interval) 2.Examine the distribution of cases by the following: Time}Look for time-place interaction Place Person (Age group, specific group, etc) 3.Develop hypotheses based on the following: Existing knowledge (if any) of the disease Analogy of diseases of known etiology Findings from investigation of the outbr eak. 4.Test Hypotheses Further analyze existing data (case - contr ol studies) Refine hypotheses and collect additional data that may be needed 5.Recommend control measures Contr ol of current outbr eak. Prevention of futur e similar outbr eaks. 6.Prep are a written repor t of the investigation and the findings 7.Communicate findings to those involved in policy development and implementation and to the public. DETERMINE WHE THER A CERTAIN DISE ASE IS ASSOCIA TED WITH A CERTAIN EXPOSURE? To identif y whether the association exists betw een the disease and the suspect ed food, the data from case -contr ol and cohor t studies is obtained, the two type of analytical studies most commonly used in outbr eak investigations. In case of the hypothetical investigation in a food borne disease, the suspect ed food is identified and for each food the attack rate (incidence rate) is calculat ed for those who ate the food (exposed) and for those who did not eat the food (non-exposed). The value of a comp arison group for identif ying specific exposur es is illustrat ed by the example of a school outbr eak of gastr oenteritis, in which 30 cases are identified and interviewed about their food consumption which shows that all of them ate vanilla ice-cr eam purchased from street vendor a day befor e illness. Enquiring about consumption of other foods shows that no other food was consumed by as many cases as vanilla ice cream. Comp aring the exposed with non-exposed reveals that all the healthy students (non-exposed) also ate vanilla ice cream purchased from the street vendor . Comp aring the other exposur es revealed that most of the exposed students had lunch in the school canteen the day befor e illness while most of the healthy students did not. This indicat es that food from the school canteen is the most likely vehicle for the outbr eak. So in case of food borne outbr eak to determine whether certain exposur e is associat ed with a certain disease we must determine whether there is an excess risk of disease in exposed population by comp aring the risk o f disease in exposed population t o the risk o f disease in non-exposed population. The Attack rate is commonly used in disease outbr eak investigations and is a key factor in the formulation of hypotheses. IDENTIFYING FOOD BORNE OUTBRE AK: A TEAM APPR OACH When a food borne disease outbr eak is detected, public health and regulat ory officials shall have to work together and collect as much information as possible to find out the cause of the outbr eak, so as to prevent more people from getting sick. During an investigation, health officials collect the epidemiological data, which will be then collat ed, and analysed to establish the likely source of the outbr eak and Convincing information will be gather ed to link the illness with the contaminat ed food. In some cases, the health officials can decide to alert the public directly through electr onic media, and regulat ory authorities can alert the public, to avoid the implicat ed food product and can impose temporar y restriction on the sale, distribution or impor t of the foods implicat ed in the outbr eak. Outbr eak investigativ e teams are usually made up of a variety of professionals, including Epidemiologists Microbiologist Public Health Specialist Officer s and Inspector s from the Regulator y Authority The APHOs and PHOs, notified as DO/ FSO under FSS Act 2006, will form a part of the Investigativ e team and will assist in collection, p ackaging and transpor tation o f food samples as per pr ovisions o f the F SS Act.Food samples once collect ed and sealed will be transpor ted to public health/ food laborat ories for testing. As of now 98 NABL accredited laborat ories are notified for the purpose of analysing food samples under FSSAI act and rules and regulations. Further details can be gather ed from this websit e- Details of collection of food samples; precautions need to be taken while collecting samples, quantity to be collect ed, packaging and transpor t, etc is available from: SURVEILL ANCE FOR GENERAL SANIT ATION AND SAFE DRINKING WATER Surveillance is done at PoEs for general sanitation and provision of safe sanitation Super visor y rounds and visits are done on weekly basis to see water stagnation, presence of pests, garbage, sewage, animal carcass and general sanitation in urinals & toilets. Health inspect or/staff under takes periodic inspection of the premises. Carrier s/ conv eyances arriving at points of entry from a foreign countr y are subject ed to a sanitar y inspection for presence of rodents, insects, or other vermin infestation, contaminat ed food or water, or other insanitar y conditions. Safe drinking water The water safety is to be monit ored at Storage, Transpor tation and distribution points (including drinking water outlets). The Water Safety Plan for the PoE is to be check ed by periodic sample examination during the routine surveillance. Lifting of water samples is done fortnightly from taps, wells, water tanks and from carrier s/ conv eyances (aircrafts and ships) for various tests. At Seapor ts in addition to piped water supply and supply by motor tankers, water is also supplied to ships by water barges. These barges are routinely and as and when needed inspect ed for water testing, condition of barges, cleaning and health status of water handler s. A monthly Chlorination repor t is submitt ed by the PoE Water Supply department and a full analysis including microbiological repor t is submitt ed in every 6 month. The levels of Chlorination at Storage point can be upto 1 to 1.5 mg/L (1 to 1.5 ppm) and at consumer points to be minimum of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/L or 0.2-0.5 ppm. FOOD INSPECTION FOR SAFE TY OF FOOD ON THE FLIGHTS FOR VVIPS Food surveillance activities are under taken for visits of National VVIPs (Inside countr y and international visits) and International VIPs at the time of their visits via flights. Activities are as follows: Site: Designat ed flight kitchen for VVIP food Standard 1.Requisition letter by Special Protection Group (SPG), PM/ VVIP cell & Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) VVIP Security 2.Requisition by Air India/ Indian airlines or concerned airlines. 3.Inspection of non perishable food items is illustrat ed in Figur e no. 2.8 4.Inspection of perishable food items for the freshness is done 24 hour s befor e departure. 5.Inspection and tasting for instant poisoning of all the prepared food items for the flights is done. Sampling of prepared food is done fr om the enlisted food items with the designated flight kitchen official. 6.The sample container is sealed in the presence of security officials and flight kitchen official present is informed. It is ensur ed that the sealed sample container box is kept in refrigeration for 72 hour s after arriv al of VVIP in India . 7.If any untoward event/ illness occur on the VVIP flight then the raw material samples preserved at APHO & Delhi Police and the prepared food items preserved are to be sent to the Public Health Laborat ory for testing. : 22 :Figure no. 2.8 Inspection & Sampling o f non perishable raw food items FOOD SAFE TY ON SHIPS It is the responsibility of each ship operat or to apply all practicable measur es to ensur e that no source of infection and contamination are present on board, including in the water system or food supplies. WATER SAFE TY ON SHIPS Generally , the ship drinking-wat er supply and transfer chain consists of three major components: : 23 :1. Source of water coming into the port; The first strategy for prevention of waterborne disease should be to load ships with water that conforms to the WHO Guidelines for drinking-wat er quality (GDWQ) (WHO , 2011) or relevant national standar ds, whichev er are strict er. Source water is monit ored at the port to ensur e that water is safe. Recommended paramet ers to be monit ored include E. coli or plate count (HPC) and aesthetic paramet ers. 2. Transfer and deliv ery system , which includes hydrants, hoses, water boats and water barges; this water transfer process provides multiple oppor tunities for the introduction of contaminants into the drinking-wat er; 3. Ship water system , which includes storage, distribution and onbo ard production of drinking-wat er from overboard sources, such as seawat er (by reverse osmosis or evaporation of seawat er). All non-potable water taps need to be labelled with words such as \"UNFIT FOR DRINKING\" . There should never be a connection betw een wash-wat er or other non-potable systems and the potable water system without using an appropriat e backflow-pr evention device. Space is often very limited on ships. Potable water systems are likely to be physically close to hazar dous substances, such as sewage or waste streams, increasing the chance of cross- connections. Cold-wat er systems may be close to sources of heat, and this elevated temperatur e increases the risk of proliferation of Legionella spp. and the growth of other microbial life. The production of water on ships can be associat ed with its own potential health problems, harmful algae and Cyanobacteria , certain free-living bacteria (including Vibrio species such as V. parahaemoly ticus and V. choler ae) and some chemicals, such as boron and bromide, which are more abundant in seawat er. A Water Safety Plan (WSP) is an effectiv e means of achieving consist ency in ensuring the safety of a drinking-wat er supply . The entity responsible for each component of the drinking-wat er supply chain (i.e. port water source, shore water distribution system, transfer and deliv ery system and ship water system) should be responsible for the preparation and implementation of a WSP for that part of the process. WSPs are equiv alent to food safety plans or programmes, incorporating hazar d analysis and critical contr ol points, implement ed as part of food safety management. : 24 :: 25 :GUIDELINES FOR W ATER SAFE TY ON SHIPS 1. A water safety plan should be designed and implement ed for the port water source, for the bunk er boats or barges and for the deliv ery system into the ship and ship water system. 2. Potable water should be available in sufficient quantities. 3. Independent sur veillance o f potable wat er safety is per formed by a compet ent authority under the IHR 2005. This consists of following:- i. Audit/ inspection procedur es are put in place by a compet ent authority under the IHR 2005. ii. Documentation and implementation of a WSP are review ed, and feedb ack is provided. iii. An independent compet ent authority under the IHR 2005 responds to repor ts of incidents with the potential to adversely affect public health. Surveillance consists primarily of sanitar y inspections, based on the Water Safety Plan (WSP), of ports, watering facilities or ships. Independent inspections are conduct ed and the reliability of the supplier' s information is verified. This does not normally need to be as frequent as the continuous contr ol performed by ports and ship operat ors. Sampling procedur es for microbiological testing of potable water are described in ISO19458. Laborat ories should analyse the water accor ding to internationally accept ed technical standar ds, such as ISO/IEC 17025. There are two reasons for sampling: Standar d surveillance to perform verification of good management. More detailed inspection in case of suspect ed problems. FOOD SAFE TY FOR SHIPS Generally , the ship food supply and transfer chain consists of five major components that provide multiple oppor tunities for the introduction, or proliferation, of contaminants in food: Source of food coming into the port; Transfer of food to storage points on board ship; Storage and general distribution of food on board ship; Preparation and serving of food, including cooking and mixing by food handler s; Handling and storage of food for personal consumption by passenger s or crew, including taking food away and storing it in private areas for subsequent consumption.GUIDELINES FOR FOOD SAFE TY ON SHIPS 1.Food safety plans (FSP) are in place for each component of the food-chain. 2.Food is inspect ed and confirmed to be in safe condition upon receipt. 3.Equipment and utensils are suitable for food preparation, food storage and contact with food. 4.Materials are suitable for contact with food and protect food from contamination. 5.Facilities are suitable for safe food preparation and serving. 6.Spaces are suitable for the safe storage, preparation and service of food. 7.There are adequat e toilet and personal hygiene facilities for food handling personnel. 8.There are adequat e and effectiv e dishwashing facilities. 9.There are safe food storage systems. 10. There is a compr ehensiv e maint enance, cleaning and disinfection programme. 11.Food handling personnel practise good personal hygiene. 12.Food handler s are adequat ely trained in food safety . 13.Food waste is stored and disposed of in a hygienic manner ROLE OF IDSP In case of any food borne outbr eak detected on flight/ ship or airpor t/ seapor t/ Land port, the same will be shared with IDSP. Details of contacts also be shared with IDSP for the purpose of surveillance. REGUL ATORY MECHANISMS CODEX The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) was created in 1961/62 by Food and Agricultur e Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the WHO , to develop food standar ds, guidelines and related texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standar ds Programme. \"Codex India \" the National Codex Contact Point (NCCP) for India, is locat ed at Food Safety and Standar ds Authority of India (Ministr y of Health and Family Welfare), FDA Bhawan, Kotla Road, New Delhi -110002, India. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a process contr ol based system for food safety which has been developed based on guidelines for HACCP application as per the CAC. The International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) (4) is a global network of national food safety authorities for rapid exchange of information during food safety related events and information on impor tant food safety related issues of global interest. In the IMO' s Life-Saving Appliance Code (IMO , 2010) additional information about potable water requir ements in rescue boats is provided. Regulation 3.2 of the Maritime Labour Conv ention, 2006 includes requir ements for drinking water on board. : 26 :ILO C133 (Accommodation of 1970 defines minimum standar ds for provision of potable water for crews and has been ratified by many countries.

They have the responsibility of working in an efficient and safe manner . They have a responsibility to prevent food borne illness by practicing clean work habits and following acceptable sanitar y procedur es, thus creating a sanitar y envir onment. Management has the responsibility of training personnel (with the help of health authorities) in acceptable personal hygiene habits and in sanitar y techniques of food handling, with careful (and constant) super vision. These guidelines offer some basics for good food protection and sanitation practices. Figure no. 2.9 Components o f food sanitation practices SAFE FOOD SOUR CES FOR PREP ARING FOOD FOR PASSENGERS 1.Do home-pr epared foods. 2.Know wher e foods from (reputable distribut or, supplier and manufactur er). 3.Inspect food supplies when deliv ered for temperatur e, swelled or damaged cans and packages, odour , visible mould, insect infestation, etc. 4.Eggs are intact, not expir ed, and are refrigerat ed; liquid eggs should be pasteurized and refrigerat ed. DRY STORA GE (food, equipment, supplies) 1.Rotate stock accor ding to \"first-in, first-out\" (FIFO); create some system, such as dating. 2.Store at least six (6) inches off the floor. 3.Loose and unwrapped food or food wher e original package has been broken should be stored in : 28 :pest proof container s or tied plastic bags after proper labelling. 4.Area should be cool, well ventilat ed, well lit, and well maintained; kept clean, neat and orderly . 5.Single service items are stored properly . 6.Keep foods and all toxic chemicals separate and in well-mark ed cabinets. 7.Clean spilled food off shelv es or floor immediat ely. REFRIGERA TION STORA GE 1.Temperatur e at 41 degrees F or below: thermomet er in every unit, check ed frequently . 2.Potentially hazar dous food stored in \"chill-able \" quantities (i.e. shallow container s or small portions) and uncov ered while food is still warm (cover food when cooled to below 41 degrees F). 3.Storage practices on shelving allow for adequat e air circulation: open wired shelv es rather than solid (not covered with foil). 4.Raw food stored separate and below prepared food; better to store raw food in separate unit if available. 5.Food stored to allow adequat e air circulation; not packed too tightly . Food stored at least six (6) inches off floor ; no stacking of container s. 6.Food stored in a manner to permit \"first-in, first-out\" rotation. 7.Clean units frequently , at least weekly , to prevent dirt and microorganisms from accumulating. 8.Cover foods to protect from drippings, odour s, drying out. 9.Refrigerat e leftovers as soon as possible; throw away food not going to be used. FREEZER STORA GE (walk-in and reach-in) 1.Temperatur e 0 degrees F or below; thermomet er in each unit, check ed frequently . 2.All food container s covered. Wrap all food well to prevent freezer burn. 3.Food stored to allow adequat e air circulation; not packed too tightly . 4.Food not stored on floor of walk-in. 5.Defrosted routinely to eliminat e ice build up. 6.Units clean, free of debris. 7.Foods rotated to permit \"first-in, first-out\". 8.In ships large quantities of raw material is taken hence there are separate store room for meat/ poultr y/ fish/ vegetables/ dry provision / bond stores are used. PERSONAL HYGIENE 1.Keep the hands clean. Wash as frequently as necessar y. Wash with warm, soapy water, using friction action, and dry with paper towels or air dryer. 2.Always wash hands: *After using toilet facilities * Betw een handling raw and cook ed foods to avoid cross contamination : 29 :* After blowing the nose, sneezing, or coughing *After smoking, eating, drinking, or taking any break *After touching the face, hair (including a beard or moustache), or any unwashed body part. * After any other activity that could potentially contaminat e hands. 3.Keep fingernails clean and well-trimmed. 4.Keep uniform use a clean apron. 5.Keep hair neat and clean; use hair restraints (caps/hairnets); no loose, long hair and beards and moustaches should be kept trimmed. 6.No smoking or eating in food preparation, serving or storage areas; use designat ed areas. 7.No rings (except wedding band) or jewellery on hands or wrists. 8.The handling of food (including ice) should be minimized; use utensils or plastic gloves to eliminat e unnecessar y hand contact with prepared foods (example: do not mix salad by hand). 9.If sick (especially with diarrhoea, sore throat and/or sneezing and coughing), stay at home or go home. 10.Do not work in food preparation if a hand injury has result ed in a wound, infect ed cut or bum. FOOD PREP ARATION, HANDLING, HOLDING 1.Potentially hazar dous food should be kept cold (below 41 degrees F.) or hot (abov e 135 degrees F.); not held at room temperatur e, except during necessar y preparation (should not exceed 2 hour s). 2.Food should be prepared on approved, clean, sanitized surfaces, with clean, sanitized equipment and utensils. 3.Defrost food properly , i.e. under refrigeration, under cool running water (not to exceed 2 hour s), in a microwav e oven, or during cooking; do not leave foods to defrost at room temperatur e. 4.Fruits and vegetables should be washed prior to preparation. 5.Food should be covered or protected from contamination (dust, sneezing, coughing). 6.Do not prepare raw, cook ed or ready-t o-ser ve food on same work surface(s) (e.g., cutting board) without proper cleaning and sanitizing betw een uses. 7.Preparation equipment (slicer s, grinder s, knives, mixers) and food contact surfaces should be cleaned and sanitized betw een uses. 8.Thoroughly cook all potentially hazar dous food to proper temperatur es; check temperatur e a probe thermomet er. 9.Reheat all potentially hazar dous food quickly to 165 degrees F; do not use warming equipment or steam tables to do this; check temperatur e with a probe thermomet er. 10. Microwav es tend to cook unev enly; so stir the food or food container and check temperatur e. Cooking temperatur es should be +15 degrees hotter than requir ed temperatur es. : 30 :CUST OMER SERVICE 1.Serve food on clean and sanitized dishwar e, handled properly . 2.Use appropriat e utensils such as a serving spoon or fork, tongs or spatula to serve food. 3.Keep dining area clean. 4.Self-ser ve areas should be monit ored: * Milk dispenser area clean and spills wiped up as necessar y. * Salad bar display shall be super vised, with employ ee(s) working the operation trained in customer surveillance and product knowledge. Sign display ed in salad bar area stating: -That the use of hands by consumer s is a violation of state law; and -That smoking is prohibit ed in the salad bar display area and adjacent areas. *Condiment area should be kept clean and spills wiped up. *Wiping clothes (used to wipe tables) should be cleaned in separate sanitizing solution. CLEANING EQUIPMENT AND FACILIT Y A planned sanitar y maint enance program is crucial for good sanitation contr ol. Each food service unit will have a somewhat differ ent cleaning schedule depending on equipment use, amount of equipment, and business volumes. It is desirable to develop (and post) a cleaning (and sanitizing) schedule of: 1.What is to be cleaned? 2.Who is to do 3.When to clean (frequency; daily, weekly , monthly)? 4.How to clean (equipment and supplies to clean floor s, hoods and filters, slicer s, food-contact surfaces, etc.)? 5.Cleaning equipment and supplies must be stored separately from food. 6.Wiping clothes should be kept clean, stored in a sanitizing solution; the use of sponges is not recommended. 7.Clean up spills immediat ely because: *Food soil is difficult to clean when dry *Floor s can get slipper y (safety hazar d) *They can attract pests (roaches, flies, rodents) *The surrounding floor area may be track ed up *Regular and adequat e cleaning (housek eeping) of a facility promot es a sanitar y physical plant and equipment used in a good service operation. PEST CONTR OL (ROA CHES, FLIES, RODENTS) 1.Keep garbage container s clean (use plastic bag liners) and covered when not in continuous use. 2.Depriv e pests of food and shelt er by following satisfact ory food protection and sanitation practices: : 31 :* Keep areas clean * Keep foods covered * Seal all junctur es of walls and equipment when ther e is insufficient sp ace for easy cleaning behind or betw een equipment (good hiding place for roaches). 3.Prevent entry: * Keep door s and windows tight-fitting and shut; door cracks no greater than 1/4 inch to exclude rodents. * Door s are self-closing. * Provide screens that are tight-fitting and in good repair, with screening less than 16 mesh to the inch being used. * Keep water in waste drains (special problem in winter wher e humidity is low) to keep out rodents and roaches. 4.Be awar e of pest indicat ors: * Droppings of roaches and rodents * Tracks and rub marks of rodents along the floor and wall junctur e. 5.Extermination should be planned with a licensed pest contr ol personnel on a routine basis; no chemicals should be used by food service personnel for pest contr ol activity 6.For fly contr ol, \"fly paper\" (non-chemical) should be used outside only (away from food). No chemical resin strips are to be used. Air curtains, UV traps, and close-fitting, self-closing door s are also helpful. DISH WASHING 1.Mechanical Pre-scrape and pre-rinse dishes and utensils Wash temperatur e should be approximat ely 140 - 160 degrees F. No overloading or improper racking. Spray arms should be kept free of food particles and other obstructions; pumps operating properly . Temperatur e and pressur e gauges working. Unit should be cleaned at least once daily or more often if needed. Remov al from racks and sorting done in a sanitar y manner . Dishwar e and utensils air dried - no towel drying. If a high temp. sanitizing unit: rinse temperatur e should be min.180 degrees F. If a chemical sanitizing unit: obtain sanitizer test strips to monit or solution strength of rinse cycle Air dry - do not use towels. : 32 :2. Manual a.Pre-scrape and pre-rinse. b.Wash - use a good detergent; wash water at 110 - 120 degrees F. c.Rinse thoroughly with clear hot water. d.Sanitize - hot water at 180 degrees F or use an approved chemical (chlorine, iodine, or quaternar y ammonium, at the proper concentrations for the proper length of time. e.Air dry - do not use towels. FAILURE OF EQUIPMENT 1. Close the food service establishment if: * You have extended electrical outage *Loss of water supply (or extended problems) *Sewage backup problems *Extreme, out-o f-contr ol pest infestation 2. Make sure an ample supply of disposable dishwar e and utensils are on hand in case of dishwasher problems. 3. Notif y health authorities; get advice and/or ask for help. : 33 :3.

Some of the diseases which are transmitt ed by houseflies include typhoid, diarrhoea, eye inflammation, cholera polio. House Fly 2.Blue bottle fly and Green bottle fly are also close association with human habitation and they are also carrier s of the abov e diseases. Blue Bottle Fly Green Bottle Fly : 37 :3.Cockro aches are proven or suspect ed carrier s of the or ganism causing; diarrhea, dysenter y, leprosy , plague, typhoid - viral disease such as poliomy elitis . In addition they carr y the eggs o f parasitic worms and may cause aller gic reaction, including dermatitis, it ching, swelling o f the eyelids and mor e serious r espirat ory conditions. Cockro ach Rodents Rodents play a key role in transmission of infectious agents in addition to being hazar ds by their activities. Rodents are carrier s of viral, rickettsial and bacterial disease. The causativ e agents could enter our body by four differ ent ways: Through the ecto-parasit es of rat like fleas, ticks and mites. By food or water contaminat ed by rodent excreta. Through direct contact with rodent excreta By rat bite. In India, there are 104 species of rodents of which 8 are consider ed to be the zoonotic reservoir of various communicable diseases. Among these, five species of rodents namely Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus, Mus indica are synanthr opic i.e, they live in close association with man and play impor tant role in the transmission and spread of various rodent borne diseases viz., plague, leptospir osis, scrub typhus, salmonellosis and Kyasanur Forest Disease.

As per IHR area within 400 meter radius at all the PoEs should be free from vectors. The impor tation of vectors from countries wher e certain diseases are endemic into countries wher e they are not endemic may have dire consequences: transmission of disease, establishment of vector and need for an appropriat e contr ol programme. Integrated Vector Management (IVM) is a key to contr ol vectors at Points of Entry. IVM planning cycle is illustrat ed in Figur e no. 3.6. A situation analysis consisting of epidemiological assessment, vector assessment and prioritization of disease and areas for intervention is done. Appr opriat e contr ol measur es are select ed based on situation analysis. Needs assessment for the area and available resour ces is done, follow ed by implementation of appropriat e contr ol measur es. ored through entomological surveillance. Feedb ack from evaluation is further used to analyse the situation and make requir ed changes in the process of IVM. : 39 :: 40 :Various well-tested v ector control measures are as follows:- A. control measures: 1. Environmental onmental methods of contr olling mosquit o breeding including source reduction minor engineering works, by filling ditches, pits, low lying areas, streamlining, canalizing, desilting, deweeding, trimming of drains, water disposal and sanitation, emptying water container s once in a week and obser ving weekly Dry Day. Envir rodents and cockr oaches. Proper storage of grains and foodstuff 2. Mechanical control: Window and door scr eening. Drilling holes in fender s for drainage. Remov al and safe storage of scrap. Rat proofing of dwelling units and plugging of rodent burrows with concr ete. Poecilia (Guppy ) are also used in certain situations wher e the chemical contr ol is not feasible. Biological larvicides : Two species of endot oxin bacteria are recommended under NVBDCP- Bacillus thuringiensis serotype H-14 and Bacillus sphaericus for contr ol of aquatic stages of vector anti-lar weekly intervals with approved chemical larvicides to contr ol the vector mosquit oes are recommended. The following chemical larvicides are used in the programme: Temephos (as 50% emulsion concentrat e, as 1% ors (Pyripr oxifen, Diflubenzur on). Adulticides application - 1. For Indoor Situations : Indoor residual spraying: Malathion25% WP, Deltamethrin2.5% WP, WP, Lambdacyhalothrin 10% WP and Bifenthrin 10 WP are to be used as per the NVBDCP program. Indoor space spraying: Pyrethrum extract, Cyphenothrin 2. For Situations : Outdoor Malathion Cyphenothrin 3.Both (DMP) on exposed parts of the body sparing eyes and other sensitiv e parts of the body to avoid flea bite. B. Rat Fleas Control: 1.Dust formulation: The most rapid and effectiv e method of contr olling the fleas is the application of an insecticidal dusting powder and it is called as insuf falation Malathion 5% dust powder (1 part of 25% WP) is used. Insecticide dust applied on rodent runways and burrows is more effectiv e in contr olling fleas. The insecticide can be used at 8 weekly intervals. 2.Residual insecticidal spray for flea control: The use of residual sprays may be under taken in lower parts of the walls up to one metr e abov e ground level in residential areas. The residual spray of malathion and synthetic pyrethroids may be carried out at 6-8 weeks and 10-12 weeks intervals respectiv ely.The residual spray of insecticide is under taken for flea contr ol with the use of following spray formulations: 2 Malathion 25% WP: Malathion suspension is applied @ 2.0 gm/m of active ingradient. Synthetic pyrethroids: Generally the use of synthetic pyrethroids should be avoided but may be used during emer gent situations. 2 Deltamethrin 2.5% WP: The suspension is @ 20.0mgm/ mof active ingredient. 2 Cyfluthrin 10% WP: The suspension @ 25mgm/ mof active ingredients. 2 Lambdacyhalothrin 10% WP: The suspension applied @ 25mgm/ m of activ e ingr edients. C. Sand Flies Control Measures 1.Sanitation: Remov al of shrubs and v egetation, filling o f cracks and cr evices in the wall & floor and distance o f cattle sheds and poultr y from human habitations. 2.Indoor s Applications: House, offices, pet - house, etc have been infest ed by sand flies, then below listed steps need to follow ed. Vacuuming - Vacuum ev ery nook and corner o f the house, especially the carpets. If y ou come across any cracks in walls, floor s, ceiling, window panels, etc then vacuum these as well. It has been proven the vacuuming kills adult and eggs of sand flies. : 42 :Steam Cleaning - Steam cleaning is another most powerful way to kill eggs, larvae, pupae and adult sand flies. Reason being that sand flies cannot sustain in very high temperatur es and while steam cleaning the temperatur e will rise to 1030 degrees eradicating the sand flies. Closing cracks and gaps - If you have come across any cracks/gaps in walls, floor, ceiling, window panels, door panel then you would need to close them out after vacuuming properly . This will prevent sand flies for futur e infestation as they love to breed in cracks. DEET Insect Repellent - After cleaning the house properly , spray the DEET Insect Repellent. You could easily find them in the shopping store next to your house. Insecticides -Easily spray insecticides inside the house to exterminat e sand flies. However make sure that you follow the instructions written on the insecticide carefully , in some cases you might need to keep childr en and pets outside the spray ed area for couple of hour s. 3.Outdoor s Applications: Garb age can, garden, lawn, etc have been infest ed by sand flies, then below listed steps need to follow ed. Boric Acid - If the sand flies have infest ed your garbage can then just put some boric acid on the floor near garbage can. Diatomaceous Earth - If the infest ed area is sand, soil or any moist area then you can sprinkle diatomaceous earth. However you would need to sprinkle it again in case of a show er or rain. Insecticides - If your garden or lawn is infest ed then you could spray insecticides. D. Housef ly Control Measures 1.Environmental Sanitation: The key to managing all filth flies is sanitation . Eliminating fly breeding sites, i.e., the material to which they are attract ed to and on which they lay eggs, is usually sufficient to eliminat e and prevent fly infestations. Conv ersely, without thorough sanitation, other contr ol methods are largely ineffectiv e. Therefore, trash should be kept in sealed container s (in trash bags and/or cans with tight-fitting lids). Dumpst ers should be kept as clean as possible, emptied regularly and kept as far away from buildings as is practical. Manur e and other decaying plant and animal material should be promptly remov ed. Also, eliminat e areas of excessiv e moistur e. 2.Inspection: Just as sanitation is the key to successful filth fly management, inspection is the key to sanitation. To eliminat e fly breeding sites, one must first locat e the attracting material. Often this can only be accomplished by conducting a thorough inspection of the premises, and by knowing what to look for and wher e to look. First, identif y the flies involved, inspect for material that attracts the species and then eliminat e the material. 3.Exclusion: Another impor tant step in fly management is to exclude them from the premises. This is done by keeping door s, windows and vents closed as much is practical, and by screening and sealing around these and other fly entry points. Automatic door closing devices and air curtains that blow air away from door ways also can be installed to supplement an integrat ed fly management program. : 43 :4.Mechanical Control: In addition t o fly swatting, mechanical fly contr ol includes Trapping. S ticky f ly paper is one type of fly trap. Ultraviolet light traps ar e another , often used t o supplement fly contr ol in commer cial buildings. T o be effectiv e light traps must be pr operly placed. This type o f trap should be placed wher e it cannot be seen fr om outside the building, no mor e than 5 feet abov e the floor (wher e most flies fly), and away fr om competing light sour ces and food pr eparation ar eas. Bulbs should be changed at least once per y ear. Fly Light T rap S ticky Fly P aper T rap 5.Chemical Control: While the use of pesticides is usually not the best means of managing filth fly problems, sometimes chemical contr ol can be a valuable component of an integrat ed fly management program. Pesticide- releasing fly strips can be placed in attics and smaller , unoc cupied closed rooms wher e filth flies are a problem. Contact (non-residual ) pesticides labelled for fly contr ol can be applied as a space treatment (\"fogged\") to kill adult flies. This type of contr ol provides only temporar y relief and cannot be relied upon to eliminat e the problem. Residual pesticides - those that remain active for some time - can be applied to outdoor surfaces wher e flies rest, such as the outside surfaces of barns, stables, restaurants and houses. Some pesticide bait formulations are also available for outdoor fly contr ol, including use around dumpst ers. E.Cockro aches Control Measures: 1.Environment Management & R eduction o f accessibility- - Leave no food for c ockroaches a.Keep premises, especially kitchen, dry and clean b.Store food properly and remov e pet food complet ely after feeding c.Put all refuse and food remnants into a bin with well-fitting lid. Cont ents of the dustbin must be emptied complet ely at least daily. Refuse bags should be tied up befor e disposal to prevent spilling. -Eliminate Harbor ages for Cockroaches a.Clean up refuse and unused articles especially old newsp apers and magazines at homes; b.Inspect at least quarterly the bottom and back of furnitur e and concealed places like false ceilings, air ducts and wire ducts; and c.Seal any cracks and crevices at ceilings and on walls and floor. : 44 :2.Stop Cockroaches from entering premis es a.Install drain covers (without openings) which can be opened for the dischar ge of the drainage water. Replace them if they are found damaged; b.Seal all openings on external walls, floor s and roofs through which pipes and wires pass or left by installation of split-type air-conditioner s; c.Apply a band of petroleum jelly at least 10 cm in width around dry drain hole to prevent cockr oach from passing through the hole; and d.Install wire mesh of 2mm at drain holes for preventing entry of Periplaneta americana . 3.Trapping a.Use sticky traps at places frequent ed by cockr oaches. Whenev er possible, place traps either against a wall or in a corner of a floor, a shelf or a draw er 4.Poisoning (Chemical Control) Use insecticide with residual effect for killing the pest by contact; 1.Set poisonous bait to kill cockr oaches. The bait will not only kill those cockr oaches consuming the bait but also those in the harborage indirectly; Caution must be taken when using insecticides. Follow strictly the application instructions on the label to avoid harming people and animals. 2.Boric Acid: mixed with condensed milk and besan (lentil flour) will act as to contr ol cockr oaches. During the initial phase of the cockr oach contr ol the paste has to be reapplied weekly once for a month. Then depending on the contr ol, the timing of reapplication can be extended to 2 weeks & then to 3 weeks. 5.Handling of dead cockroaches a.Wear gloves when handling dead cockr oaches. b.Areas or equipment including the gloves having contact ed with cockr oaches should be washed and disinfect ed with household disinfectant as soon as possible F. Rodents Control 1.Environmental & Sanitation: Sanitation is fundamental to rat contr ol and must be continuous. If sanitation measur es aren't properly maintained, the benefits of other measur es will be lost and rats will quickly return. Good housek eeping in and around buildings will reduce available shelt er and food sources for Norway rats and, to some extent, roof rats. Neat, off-the-gr ound storage of pipes, lumber , firewood, crates, boxes, gardening equipment, and other household goods will help reduce the suitability of the area for rats and also will make their detection easier . Collect garbage, trash, and garden debris fr equently , and ensur e all garb age r eceptacles hav e tight-fitting cov ers. Wher e dogs ar e kept and fed out door s, rats can become a pr oblem if ther e is a r eady supply o f dog food. Feed your pet only the amount of food it will eat at a feeding, and store pet food in rodent-pr oof container s. : they cause internal haemorrhage and slow deaths in 4-10 days. They are slow acting, effectiv e and safe rodenticide and mark eted as 0.5% e powder. b)Zinc phosphate: is a single dose rodenticide, when moist it slowly releases the phosphine gas, which kills the rat and fleas. c) Aluminium phosphide tablets: Two pellets of 0.6 gm/burr ow is applied in the burrow, they are closed with wet mud for killing the rodents. It may be used for killing the wild rodents in active burrows, however it should never be used in the domestic and peridomestic situation because of its high toxic effect on human beings. d)Fumigants: Cyanogas is pumped into the burrow by using \"cyanogas pump \". About 56 gm dust is pumped into each burrow after closing the exit openings and burrow is then promptly sealed with wet mud and the hydrogen cyanide gas released will kill the rodent as well as the fleas. Persons involved in the clean-up of heavy rodent infestations should wear the protectiv e equipment listed here: coveralls (disposable, if possible); rubber boots or disposable shoe covers; rubber , latex, or vinyl gloves; protective goggles; An appropriat e respirat ory protection device, such as a half-mask air-purif ying (or negativ e- pressur e) respirat or with a high-efficiency particulat e air (HEPA) filter or a powered air-purif ying respirat or (PAPR) with HEPA filters. Follow local and state requir ement regarding pulmonar y function and fit testing befor e beginning any work requiring the use of a respirat or. Personal protective gear should be decontaminat ed upon remov al at the end of the day. All potentially infectiv e waste material (including respirat or filters) from clean-up operations that cannot be burned or deep-buried on site should be double-b agged in appropriat e plastic bags. The bagged material should then be labeled as infectious (if it is to be transpor ted) and disposed of in accor dance with local requir ements for infectious waste. 3.Rodent Control and prev ention: Mass destruction of rats by baiting and trapping should be under taken during inter epidemic period. During epidemic situations the rodent contr ol activities should be discouraged because the killing o f a lar ge number o f rodents may r esult in large number of fleas leaving their dead hosts and give rise to a further increase in plague cases as the flea may attack the human population. Therefore, rat contr ol should always be preceded by measur es to contr ol fleas. 4.Permanent Rodent Bait Stations Using permanent bait stations in a rodent contr ol programme may increase the effectiv eness and safety of rodent baits. Permanent bait stations are useful as they protect the baits from dust and rain, the baits are most acceptable to the target animals while keeping non target animals and childr en away from baits, provide a protected place for rodents to feed thereby allowing them to feed more secur ely, Allow to attract and kill rodents from the inaccessible/ vast areas, Easy monit oring, cleaning and replacement of baits, help in studying the impact of rodenticides on rodent density and bait shyness. : 46 :5.Rodent Traps- like snap traps, live captur e traps, glue boards and baiting the traps.(Fur ther details on Integrat ed vector management are .nvbdcp.gov GEMENT FOR MOSQUIT OES UNDER NVBDCP A package of vector contr ol interventions against dengue is advised, targeting both immatur e and adult stages. Evidence base on vector contr ol against dengue is poor. Contr ol programmes should monit or the effectiv eness of their interventions. Larval source management should be in place for routine contr ol. In case of outbreak , additional inter ventions like IRS, fogging or ultra low volume (ULV) spray should be implemented. The evidence for aerial or truck mount ed ULV is limited as such interventions have no sustained impact on mosquit o populations, is not cost effectiv e during outbr eaks and efficacy is variable. Vector contr ol interventions are same for urban and rural areas. Surveillance on insecticide resistance is critical for deciding the type of insecticide which should be used. Surveillance of resistance is done by ICMR, NIMR and Zonal entomologist. Vector management for malaria is done on the basis of API and ecotype.

Identification of passenger s with whom the sick traveller came in contact during his journey can be traced through Passenger Manifest. B. Luggage & baggage: No routine inspection or health measur es are requir ed to be under taken for luggage & baggage : 48 :Activity on departure of aircraf t/ cargo: No routine inspection or health measur es are requir ed to be under taken for the travellers or conv eyances for int ernational occurr ence the measur es ar e to be tak en as per dir ection from the Government of India. WHO defines \" disinsection \" as the pr ocedur e wher eby health measur es ar e tak en to contr ol or kill the insect vectors of human diseases present in baggage, cargo, container s, conv eyances, goods and postal parcels. Details of various aircraft disinsection methods are elaborat ed in Table no. 3.2 Rodent control Aircraft occasionally have to be fumigat ed by highly trained, licensed operat ors if rodents are present or if there is a very severe cockro aches infestation. This requir es the aircraft to be taken out of service for 7-15 hour s. The airpor t health authorities and aircraft management are informed of any fumigations being carried out. Pest control: Passenger aircraft are regularly treated with insecticides for the contr ol of cockro aches and other insect pests in the galley and toilet areas. Some of the insecticides applied, both as residuals and ultra-low- volume aerosols, are the same as those used for contr olling insects of public health impor tance. Pest contr ol treatments are carried out once a month or immediat ely on the return of aircraft to their base if cockr oaches or biting insects have been seen especially by crew member s. : 49 :Table no. 3.3 Methods o f Disinsection o f Aircraf ts S.

MERS-CoV/H1N1/SARS 1% Virkon is a multi-purpose disinfectant. It contains oxone (potassium peroxymonosulfat e), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonat e, sulfamic acid, and inorganic buffer s. It is typically used for cleaning up hazar dous spills, disinfecting surfaces and soaking equipment. The solution is used in many areas, including hospitals, laborat ories, nursing homes, funeral homes, dental and veterinar y facilities, and anywher e else wher e contr ol of pathogens is requir ed. Virkon has a wide spectrum of activity against viruses, some fungi, and bacteria. However, it is less effectiv e against spores and fungi than some alternativ e disinfectants. Abstract: Peroxygenic acid, under the brand name Virkon\u00ae, has unleashed great debate following contradict ory repor ts of its efficacy and spectrum of activity . The aim of this study was to test the biocidal activity of the compound against 10 differ ent micro-organisms, following standar d in-vitr o test procedur es. Bactericidal, fungicidal and sporicidal activities were determined using quantitativ e suspension and germ carrier tests and virucidal activity was assessed using a simple dilution suspension test, following the Association Fran\u00e7aise de Normalisation (AFNOR) guidelines. One a, coli, S. aureus and E. hirae. One percent Virkon\u00ae show ed virucidal activity against poliovirus in the suspension test. However, this concentration did not comply with sporicidal and fungicidal activity guidelines. In conclusion, 1% Virkon\u00ae is effectiv e only against vegetativ e bacteria, yeasts and viruses, and should therefore be consider ed a low-lev el disinfectant. FOR AERIAL DISINFECTION: To replace danger ous and ineffectiv e formalin fumigation in empty farm buildings and veterinar y hospitals. Shutdown the ventilation system during the disinfection. Use a mechanical fogging machine as \u00ae part of terminal disinfection routine with a 1% w/v solution of Virkon. Apply at a rate of one litre of 3 solution per 100 m with particle size not exceeding 70 microns in order to get a minimal contact time of 10 minut es with microorganisms in the air. Leave the room during the fogging. Users and animals may re- enter the treated area once the fog has disper sed. No rinsing is requir ed >1% w/v or a contact time >10 minutes are required.

A. INSPECTION Inspection is under taken by obser ving areas of the ship. The main purpose of the inspection is to confirm that all points of contr ol have been correctly identified, and that any appropriat e contr ol measur es have been implement ed or corrective actions taken. Following documents are examined: 1. The Maritime Declaration of Health: It contains basic data relating to the state of health of crew and passenger s during the voyage and on arrival at the port, and provides valuable information on: Identification of the ship; Ports of call within past 30 days (to be listed); All crew member s and travellers within past 30 days (to be listed); Validity of the existing SSCC and whether re-inspection is requir ed; Affect ed areas visited. 2.The International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis verifies that crew member s and passenger s have been vaccinat ed accor ding to entry requir ements. 3.The following additional sources of information may be requir ed for assessment of public health risk: Management plans (E.g., water bunk ering, food safety , pest contr ol, sewage or waste) An IMO Ballast Water Repor ting Form, A medical log, A list of medicines , A Potable Water Analysis Repor t. 4. Evidence Repor t Form is used to enlist the evidence found and measur es indicat ed for containment of public health risk found on board. After the inspection, the inspecting officer should debrief the mast er about any deficiency found. The mast er or representativ e is allow ed sufficient time to address the deficiencies and to retriev e the necessar y documentation befor e completing the certificat e. B. ISSUE OF CERTIFICA TES (8) Accor ding to the evidence of the adequacy of sanitar y measur es detected during the inspection, either an SSCEC or an SSCC is issued. Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificate (SSCEC) issued when no evidence of a public health risk is found on board and the compet ent authority is satisfied that the ship is free from infection and contamination, including vectors and reservoirs. Ship Sanitation Control Certificate (SSC C) is issued when evidence of a public health risk, including sources o f infection and contamination, was det ected on bo ard and the r equir ed contr ol measur es have been satisfact orily complet ed. The SSCC records the evidence found, the contr ol measur es taken, and the samples taken and corresponding results (if applicable); if necessar y, an Evidence Repor t Form can be attached. C. CONTR OL MEASURES In general, when clinical signs or sympt oms of illness or disease are present, evidence of a public health risk (including sources of infection and contamination) is found on board, or a public health risk is definitiv ely identified, the compet ent authority determines the appropriat e public health measur es to be applied for an adequat e level of contr ol : 57 :Contr ol measur es for public health risks on ships should be applied only after all key parties (i.e. the master , the conv eyance operator or agent and the port authorities involved in this activity) have been fully informed of the intended methods. Critical activities, such as the designation o f por t areas for quarantine o f ships suspect ed of carrying a public health risk , should be identified w ell in adv ance, in cooperation with the por t operat or for ship movement. Disinsection, decontamination, deratting, disinfection and other sanitar y procedures taken pursuant to the IHR (2005) shall be performed in a manner that avoids injury and, as far as possible, discomfor t to persons. Environmental damage that affects public health, baggage, cargo, container s, conv eyances, goods or postal parcels should be avoided. As far as practicable, facilities used by travellers at points of entry should be maintained in a sanitar y condition and kept free from sources of infection or contamination, including vectors and reservoirs. These measur es shall be initiat ed and complet ed without delay , and applied in a transp arent and non-discriminator y manner . D. VECT OR CONTR OL Vector control guidelines for ships are giv en in Bo x No. 3.4 BOX NO . 3.4 VECT OR C ONTR OL GUIDELINES FOR SHIPS 1.Insect-proo f screens ? Sleeping quarters, mess rooms and dining-r ooms, indoor recreational areas and all food spaces must be effectiv ely screened when ships are in areas wher e flies and mosquit oes are prevalent. Screening of sufficient hole tightness, no more than 1.6 mm spacing, is recommended, with screens on all outside openings. Screen door s should open outwar ds and be self-closing, and the screening must be protected from damage by heavy wire netting or other means, which may include the use of metal kick plates. Ship holding water must be screened from insects and inspect ed frequently to check for, and eliminat e, mosquit o breeding. Refuse stores must be screened and inspect ed frequently to check for, and eliminat e, the breeding of flies or other vermin. Screens need to be kept in good repair. Bed nets, in good repair/ condition and properly placed, need to be used in sleeping quarters which are not provided with screens. 2. Insecticides are used to control vector densities in air spaces and on surfaces. When leaving an area wher e vectors are prevalent, and at regular intervals, residual and space sprays must be used for the contr ol of flying insects that have entered the ship. Crawling insects and other vermin are best contr olled by specific insecticides, properly applied to crawling, resting and hiding places. All surfaces that come in contact with food, all dishes and utensils and all food and drink need to be covered or remov ed during spraying operations. Insecticides, rodenticides, any other poisonous substances and all equipment for their use must not be stored in or immediat ely adjacent to spaces used for storage, handling, preparation or serving of food or drink . Further, such poisonous substances should not be stored near dishes and utensils or tablewar e, linen and other equipment used for handling or serving food and drink . To prevent the accidental use of these poisons in foodstuffs, such hazar ds must be kept in colour ed container s clearly mark ed as \"POISON\" . : 58 :RODENT SURVEILL ANCE is done in P ort premis es &surrounding areas and On board a ship: Rodent surveillance in Port premis es and surrounding areas: The idea is to find as many areas as possible that might provide harborage, food, water, or access. Detailed notes have to be made regarding the schematic map of the ship or the building. Try to locat e all entry points and nesting areas. -\"Star ter holes\" for rodents to enlar ge and these can be openings as small as 1/4 inch in diamet er in walls, around pipe entries, sewer outlets, under door s, cable duct outlets, vent holes, life boat stores, life rafts, rescue boats, mooring ropes & stores on ships, etc. Unscr eened Sewer outlets and even toilets can give rats. -Access to buildings. Nests are often composed of Shredded paper, pieces of plastic, and bits of fabric gather ed together into a 5-inch diamet er mass for Mice and 8 to 12 inch diamet er for rats. In addition, many a times there would be evidence of food debris, bones etc Figure no.3.6 - Common R odent Entr y and Harbourage Locations . : 59 :Look for water leaks and rooms wher e water condenses on the walls. Always be on the lookout for piles of trash, clutter or other debris. Note wher e the crew takes their breaks or eat lunch. These areas can present Sanitation problem. Rodents like to follow edges; inspect these areas for excreta, rub marks, urine, or other indications of activity (Figur e no. 3.7- 3.9). Inspect port user' s locker rooms, changing and rest rooms, cafet eria, kitchen, canteens, pantries in office buildings, store rooms, cargo sheds etc. Garb age Station is one of the impor tant areas to look out for activity . Take note of how garbage is dealt with, what condition dumpst ers and garb age cans ar e in, and whether r odents hav e easy access to garbage. It is essential to inspect godowns storing food grains. On the outside of the ship or the building, it is essential to check door ways for gaps or holes and note windows without screens or glass. Look for other openings in the structur es; holes, vents without screens, holes around plumbing, and electrical wire entry points. Roof rat- point ed \u00bd inch Nor way rat blunt- \u00be inch House mouse- point ed \u00bc inch Figure no. 3.7 Rat droppings Figure no. 3.8 Rodents gnaw to keep their incisor s sharp, leaving behind marking on the surfaces of wood, plastic pipes or container s.Figure no. 3.9 Foot prints of rats. The five-toed tracks of the rear paws are more commonly obser ved than the four-t oed front paws, yet both may be pr esent. This can be used t o find the direction : 60 :Note any pow er lines running int o the upper por tions o f ship; these giv e rodents access t o the roof. Check for irrigation leaks and any standing water such as irrigation or drainage ditches, stagnant pools. On the roof, check air conditioning units that might provide water and harborage for rats. Rodent surveillance on board a ship: Surveillance on board a ship comprises inspection as per inspection in docks premises to look for evidence of presence of rodents on board. Additionally: Screening starts befor e boarding the ship with the inspection of Rat guards on mooring lines (Figur e no. 3.10), position of gangway , and condition of lighting near gangway . Figure No. 3.10 Rat Guards on mooring lines Advice Mast er of the ship to provide schematic plan of various areas of the ship, cargo manifest and information of cargo loading and dischar ging plan. Inspect the Mooring Ropes placed on deck (Figur e no. 3.11) by removing them fully and seeing in betw een the space created by their placements and the floor for excreta, food debris. Inspection of life boats (Figur e no. 3.12), life rafts, rescue boats, mooring ropes & stores on ships are ideal places for rodent harbourage. : 61 : Inspect the store rooms, provision stores, galley , pantry, mess rooms, cargo holds, fore peak and after peak stores, for evidence of rodent activity . Get information from crew specially catering and provision handling crew about rodent activity . Garb age Station is one of the impor tant areas to look out for rodent activity (Figur e no. 3.13). Take note of how garbage is dealt with, what condition dumpst ers and garbage cans are in, and whether rodents have easy access to garbage. Figure no 3.13 Garb age station on ship REGUL ATORY MECHANISMS The International Health Regulations (2005) advocate achieving a vector-free zone at seapor ts, airpor ts, and ground crossings and within 400-metr e perimet er around these entry points. The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 - Central Government may take measur es and prescribe regulations for the inspection of any ship or vessel leaving or arriving at any port in India and for such detention of any person intending to sail therein, or arriving thereby, as may be necessar y. Any person disobeying any regulation or order made under this Act shall be deemed to have committ ed an offence punishable under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). Aerial navigation in British India was governed by The Indian Aircraf t Act, 1911. The Aircraf t Act 1934, section 8A provide the power to central Govt. to make rules for protecting the Public Health and Section 8B has the provision of emer gency powers with central Govt. to take measur es as deems necessar y for prevention of danger arising to public health through introduction or spread of disease. The Aircraf t (Public Health) Rules-1954 was made by central Govt. of India, in exercise of the power s conferred by Section 8A of The Aircraf t Act 1934, in super session of Indian Aircraf t (Public Health) Rules-1946. : 62 :Nodal I/C Airpor t The overall responsibility lies with the managing authority of the airpor t. Field Survey-once a week by APHO officials is done to obser ve potential breeding sites and presence of mosquit oes/ larvae within 400 meter radius of Airpor t. Sea port Surveillance in sea ports is being carried out by the Port Health Organization (PHO), a statut ory body implementing the IHR (2005) and the Indian Port Health rules. The Port Health Officer is assist ed by Medical Officer s, Health inspector s, Health Assistants and field work ers to carry out surveillance activities on board which include routine checks of ships for issue of free pratique and health clearance for sailing, screening of passenger s, inspection of ships for issue of Ship Sanitation certificates and other certificates, screening of ships on international voyage, sailing and coastal vessels for rodent activities. Integrated Check Posts Vector Contr ol Plan has to be developed by the Health Team under the Leader ship of the Land Port Health Officer , in consultation with the stakeholder s at the Point of Entry and has to be renew ed regularly . The custodian (LPAI) will engage an agency which will take vector contr ol measur es as per the advice of LPHO . This agency must be approved by the centr e or state government. : 63 :4. ZOONOSIS INTR ODUCTION The infections naturally transmissible betw een vertebrat e animal hosts and humans are called Zoonoses. (Rudolf Virchow 1880 ). WHO (1959) defines Zoonoses as \"those diseases and infections which are naturally transmitt ed betw een vertebrat e animals and man\". Major modern Zoonoses include Ebola virus disease, Salmonellosis, Anthrax, Brucellosis and Influenza. Zoonoses can be caused by a range of disease pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasit es; out of 1, 415 pathogens known to infect humans, more than 61% were zoonotic. Factors influencing Zoonotic diseases are enlist ed in Table no. 4.1 1Ecological changes in man's environment 3Entering of humans in the unaccust omed ecosyst em, Change in biting habits of the blood sucking v ectors and alteration in the population of reservoir animals. Eg. hazards) 3Higher attack rates in work ers during the course of their occup ation than the rest of the population. E.g. anthrax in carpet weavers, live stock raiser s, leptospir osis in rice field work ers, etc. 3Increased movements of man 3Due to land development, engineering project work , pilgrimages, tourism, etc. 3Exposur e to contaminat ed food giardiasis, salmonellosis, animal products Countries which impor t livestock products and livestock are likely to introduce the disease into their territories. E.g. salmonellosis, foot and mouth disease, anthrax and many diseases exotic to India. 5 Increased density of animal population 6Transpor tation of virus infected mosquitoes Aircraft, ship, train, motor and other vehicles. Eg. yellow fever, Chikungunya, Dengue. Several zoonotic diseases are major public health problems not only in India but also in differ ent parts of the world. Examples from recent past are Ebola Viral Disease (EVD) and Swine Flu. Around 80% of pathogens that could potentially be used for bioterrorism are of animal origin. The disease may be introduced into susceptible human or animal populations following a deliberate (as bioweapons or for bioterrorism) or accidental release of an infectious agent or toxin. The AQCS clearances at designated ports are very impor tant keeping in view accidental, intentional and normal entry of Infectious disease agents and toxins found in animal populations and animal products.

CHEMICAL A CCIDENTS INTR ODUCTION The impacts of chemical accidents can be deadly , for both human beings and the envir onment. A chemical accident or emer gency refers to an event which results in the release of a substance or substances that are hazar dous to human health and/or the envir onment in the short or long term. These events can cause illness, injury, disability or death to human beings, often in large number s, and can result in ext ensiv e damage t o the envir onment with considerable human and economic costs (OECD/ UNEP). Chemical accidents may be categorised as a major accident or a disast er depending upon the number of casualties, injuries and damage to the proper ty or envir onment. A major accident is defined in the Manufactur e, Storage and Impor t of Hazar dous Chemicals (MSIHC) Rules, 1989, issued under the Envir onment (Protection) Act, 1986, wher eas 'disast er' is defined in the DM Act, 2005. (12) HAZCHEM: HAZCHEM are chemical compounds that can be used for mass destruction, causing serious damage to the health and proper ty of society . (13) HAZMA Ts: HAZMATs are any solids, liquids, or gases that can harm people, other living organisms, proper ty, or the envir onment. HAZMAT may be radio active, flammable, explosiv biohazar dous, an oxidiser , an other charact eristics that render it hazar dous in specific circumstances. (13) CHEMICAL INDUSTR Y IN INDIA The Indian Chemical Industr y owing to the wide spectrum of products manufactur ed and also due to the increasing development of new products has begun to pose a challenge in terms of the envir onment and health risks. Growth of chemical industr y in India has increased the risk of occurr ence of incidents associat ed with hazar dous chemicals (HAZCHEM). Chemical industries in India manufactur e a wide and diverse range of products. These can be grouped into ten impor tant chemical sectors: Pesticides, Fertiliser s, Oil Refineries, Petrochemicals, Bulk Drugs, Dyes & Dye Intermediat es, Chlor-Alkali, Soda Ash, Paint and Ink & Printing Ink. Based on threshold criteria in the law (MSIHC Rules, 1989) certain installations are categorized as Major Accident Hazar d (MAH) Units. There are about 1861 Major Accident Hazar d (MAH) units, spread across 301 districts and 25 states & 3 Union Territories, in all zones of countr y. Besides, there are thousands of regist ered and hazar dous factories (below MAH criteria) and un-or ganized sectors dealing with numer ous range of hazar dous material posing serious and complex levels of disast er risks. Multihazar d districts are illustrat ed in Figur e no. 5.1 : 73 :Figure no. 5.1 Distribution o f MAH units and multi hazard districts across India [16]. MAJOR CHEMICAL ACCIDENTS (WORLD) March 23, 2005, a disast er at a major petroleum refiner y in Texas City, United States, was consider ed US' worst industrial disast er in 15 years. A series of explosions took place when a hydrocarbon isomerization unit was restar ted and a distillation tower flooded with hydrocarbons. As a result, 15 were killed and another 180 were injured. In September 2001 an explosion occurr ed in a shed containing about 300 tonnes of downgraded ammonium nitrat e at a chemical plant in Toulouse, belonging to one of France 's leading fertilizer producer s. The explosion caused 31 deaths and injured more than 4,500 people, while destr oying 27,000 buildings in the area. In Februar y 2000 a poisonous chemical spill that took place in the Romanian city of Baia Mare destr oyed wildlife and fish stocks while threatening the water supplies of 2.5 million people all 3 over the Central and Eastern Europe. Appr oximat ely 100,000 m of cyanide, used in the gold extraction process at a local mine, was released into the river Somes when a reservoir wall at the mine collapsed. The event was described as Europe's worst disast er since Chernobyl. In June 1974, near the village of Flixbor ough in the United Kingdom, took place an event which led to a significant tight ening of the UK government' s regulations covering hazar dous industrial processes. A locally owned chemical plant, while repairing one of its chemical reactors, produced in less than a minut e a leak of 40 tonnes of cyclohexane, which formed a vapour cloud with a diamet er of about 200 m. The cloud exploded and complet ely destr oyed the plant, also damaging about 1,800 buildings on a more than 1.5 km radius. : 74 :MAJOR CHEMICAL ACCIDENTS (INDIA) Bhop al Gas tragedy One of the deadliest chemical accidents took place in 1984 at a pesticide plant in the state of Madhya Pradesh in central India. On the midnight betw een December 2nd and 3rd, a combination of factors ranging from hazar dous handling of danger ous chemical substances to the use of outdated and malfunctioning industrial equipment led to the exposur e of over 5, 00, 000 people to toxic gases and by products, resulting in nearly 3, 800 officially confirmed human deaths. The aftermaths of the disast er are present even today . Figure no. 5.2 Bhop al Gas T ragedy Following the Bhop al Gas Disast er in 1984, major incidences of chemical disast ers in India include a fire in an oil well in Andhra Pradesh (2003); a vapour cloud explosion in the Limit ed Refiner y (HPCL), Vishakhap atnam (1997); and an explosion in the Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limit ed (IPCL) Gas Crack er Complex, Nagothane, Maharashtra (1990). Over 20 major chemical accidents have been repor ted in MAH units during 2002-06. : 75 :: 76 :Box No. 5.1 Following agencies recognize institut es and laborat ories wher e chemical analysis is under taken. :- The Central Pollution Control Board under the Envir onment (Protection) Act 1986 laborat ories under the Envir onment (Protection) Act 1986, Section 12(1) B. The CPCB has listed precise criteria for short-listing laborat ories based on equipment available, size, manpow er and various other criteria. The criterion is based on analysis of wastes and pollutants rather than basic chemical synthesis. The Ministr y of Science and Technology , Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and are capable of under taking basic chemical analysis The Ministr y of Agriculture (National level and state level Institut es, Bureaus, Project Offices etc.) these are capable of analysing agro chemical compositions and crops/ seeds analysis Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Central Board for Excise and Customs (Central Revenue Laboratories) have an impor tant role in analysing hazar dous waste and other chemicals entering the countr y. Centre for Explosiv e Safety (CEES), Ministr y of Defence for the purpose of testing of explosiv es/ explosiv e charges/ detonators/ fuses etc., some of these are accredited by the NABL. Ministr y of Labour : These are capable of under taking basic analysis for occup ational hygiene. The National Accreditation Board for Laboratories (NABL) The major universities and resear ch institut es have well known departments of chemistr y and chemical technology/ engineering compounded with good in house Resear ch and Development activity . Points of entry are particularly vulnerable to chemical accidents as many PoE are locat ed in districts with MAH units. Points of entry need to develop specific capacities in the application of public health measur es requir ed to manage a variety of public health risks. These capacities include access to appropriat e medical services (with diagnostic facilities), services for the transpor t of ill persons, trained personnel to inspect ships, aircraft and other conv eyances, maint enance of a healthy envir onment as well as ensuring plans and facilities to apply emer gency measur es such as quarantine. The Ministr y Envir onment and Forests (MoEF) is the nodal ministr y for chemical disast ers and has played an active role in the process of enhancing emer gency preparedness at all levels. Role of Ministr y of Health and Family Welfare in chemical accidents is suppor tive. Accident data remains scatt ered and with multiple agencies. Petroleum incidents, Explosiv e accidents, Factory incidents, Nuclear accidents, Mines incidents, Insecticides incidents and Port incidents are to be informed to the respectiv e \"authority\" specified under various legislations. As a result, accident data is not presently compiled at a central location. The MoEF , being the 'nodal\" ministr y for chemical accidents, is supposed to be notified on occurr ence of any chemical incident. CENTRAL CRISIS GROUP (15) The Central Crisis Group (CCG) has been set up by the Ministr y of Envir onment, Forest and Climat e Change. This is an apex body comprising senior officials of the Government and technical exper ts. : 77 :The functions of the Group are as follows: i.To deal with major chemical accidents and provide exper t guidance for handling major chemical accidents in the countr y. ii.Continuously monit or the post-accident situation arising out o f a major chemical accident and suggest measur es for prevention and to check recurr ence of such accidents. iii.Conduct post-accident analysis of such major chemical accidents and evaluat e responses. iv.Review District Off-Sit e Emer gency Plans with a view to examining its adequacy in accor dance with, the Manufactur e, Storage and Impor t of Hazar dous Chemicals Rules, 1989 and suggest measur es to reduce risks in the industrial pock ets. v.Review the progress repor ts submitt ed by the State Crisis Group. vi.Respond to queries addressed to it by the State Crisis Group and District Crisis Group. vii.Publish a State-wise list of exper ts and officials who are concerned with the handling of chemical accidents. viii.Render in the event of a chemical accident in a State, all financial and infrastructural help as may be necessar y. EMER GENCY RESPONSE CENTRES (ERCs) Emer approved the proposal to establish three more Emer gency Response Centr [13] This is a voluntar y scheme and is institut ed in the larger interest of envir onment. The ERC establishes link among industries, exper t crisis gr oups and exper t envir onmental agencies during the crisis situation t o ensur e proper mitigation measur es for any possible accident and contr ol the scenario in case of an accident. These Centr es are set up on mutual cost sharing basis (equity participation) with 50% share from the State Government and 50% from the beneficiar y or member units. The ERCs maintains technical information including safe isolation distances during chemical mishap, data on Major Accident Hazar d (MAH) units, contact addresses of relevant agencies, etc. They coordinat e with the Local Crisis Group (LCG), District Crisis Group (DCG) and State Crisis Group (SCG) during the chemical emer gency . They organise programmes at various levels in the State to bring awar eness among the common citizens regarding hazar ds associat ed with handling and management of chemicals and the associat ed safety aspects for prevention and mitigation of possible chemical mishaps. CENTRAL CRISIS CONTR OL ROOM (15) MoEF has set up a Crisis Contr ol Room for fast flow of information and coordination of activities during an : 78 :emer gency . The Contr ol Room is part of the Crisis Alert System (CAS), locat ed at Room No. 705 in Paryavaran Bhawan with a 24 hour contact telephone number (Phone 4360734). Operation of Control Room during Office Time The Contr ol Room operat e during office hour s from 9.00 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. on working days only i.e. Monday through Friday . The Contr ol Room will be used for managing crisis situations and also as a venue for conv ening the meeting of Central Crisis Group (CCG) in case of a crisis. In addition, messages can be faxed at Fax no. 4360678 and 4363577. Operation of Control Room before and after Office Hour s including Holidays After office hour s and on holidays, the Central Registr y Room on the Ground Floor , Paryavaran Bhav an, B- Block ,CGO Complex, Lodi Road, New Delhi-110003 receiv e messages and pass them on to the Member Secretary immediat ely (Phone: 4360634 (O)/ 4677974 (R).

The immediat ely after intimation, activate the Contr ol Room in Room No.705 mentioned in (a) abov e. Further details can be accessed from: NATIONAL POISON INFORMA TION CENTRE (NPIC) The National Poison Information Centr e was set up in the Department of Pharmacology in 1995 at All India Institut es of Medical Science (AIIMS), New Delhi, funded by MoEF . The centr e functions round the clock , 365 days in year and provides information on various poisonings and treatment protocols on telephone, fax, e-mail and in person. The NPIC has the back-up of latest literatur e on poisoning due to a variety of products that include household items, agricultural and industrial chemicals, drugs, envir onmental toxins including plants, animal bites and stings and other miscellaneous products. The data receiv ed by Centr e is compiled and analysed for knowing the trend. POISON CONTR OL CENTRES Poison Contr ol Centr es are specialised units providing information on poisoning, and their main function is to provide information and advice concerning the diagnosis, pr ognosis, tr eatment and pr evention o f poisoning as well as information about the toxicity of chemicals and the risks they pose. The following five poison contr ol centr es are also recognised by World Health i.The Poisions Information Centr e, Department of Pharmacology , All India Institut e of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ansari Nagar , New Delhi Centr The Amrita Institut e of Medical Sciences of Occup ational Health, Poisons Information Centr e, The Toxicology & IMCU Unit, Government General Hospital, Chennai 600 003, E-mail: ; e, The Industrial Toxicology Resear ch specialized protective measur es and highly sophisticat ed responses because of the natur e of the materials involved. These responses are not well under stood even by emer gency agency personnel in the local communities, and certainly not by the general public. Off-sit e emer gency response is relativ ely more complex and complicat ed as it involves unorganized, multi- stakeholder and multi-agency coordination. First response from police, fire, medical aid and life saving, transpor t route controls , and handling transpor t emergencies involving hazardous chemicals are impor tant aspects for off-site emer gency preparedness and response. EMER GENCY PLANNING FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES Health units should maintain an inventory of available equipment that might be needed and have up to date information on how to obtain additional suppor t. Ensur e that decontamination equipment and facilities are available (if not on site then by mobile units) Have access t o specialised information and t o specialists for appr opriat e treatment o f exposed victims. Maintain a regist er of health/ medical professional who could be called upon to assist the health units. Have plans/ procedur es for sending patients to other health facilities when necessar y, protecting other people from contamination, regist ering all individuals who arrive at the health unit for treatment as a result of exposur e to HAZCHEM. Have a designat ed (separate) telephone line, in service 24 hour s a day for use by emer gency services in event of an accident, with a back up communication system.

Figur e no 5.4 shows the legal instruments for management of chemicals in India. Non-regulator y Mechanism for Managing Chemicals These are very impor tant in management of chemicals in India as they take several initiativ es for envir onmental protection and chemical management, such as Responsible Care, Corporate Responsibility in Envir onmental Planning (CREP), ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, ISRS, Bureau Indian Standar ds (BIS) 1986 (Initially The Indian Standar ds Institution (ISI) set up in 1947) Eco Mark , Agmark (promot es Grading and Standar disation of agricultural and allied commodities under Agricultural Produce (Grading & Marking) Act, 1937) etc. Additionally , several awar ds related to chemical and envir onmental management are initiat ed on voluntar y basis by industrial associations, who play an impor tant role in encouraging industries to go for non-r egulat ory mechanisms. Impor tant industrial associations include:- -Indian Chemical Council (ICC) (formerly the ICMA - Indian Chemical Manufactur er's Association) -Confederation of Indian Industr y (CII) -Federation of Indian Chamber s of Commer ce and Industr y (FICCI) In addition to the illustrat ed regulations in Figur e no. 5.3, transpor tation tation of danger ous goods is requir ed to conform to the International Air Transpor t Association (IATA), Danger ous Goods Regulations which govern the packaging and labeling of HAZCHEM. A set of technical instructions for the safe transpor t of danger ous goods by air was also issued by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 1982-83. 2. Maritime Transpor tation of danger ous goods follows the conv entions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO); Maritime Pollution (MARPOL) Confer ence; and Safety Of Life At Sea (SOL AS) Conv ention.

(13) : 84 :: 85 RADIOL OGICAL & NUCLE AR A CCIDENTS INTR ODUCTION st In the 21 centur y nuclear radiation is being used in diverse fields like medicine, in agricultur e and the food processing industries. Power generat ed through nuclear technology is seen as a prime economic move in taking the countr y forward in a world with fast-depleting reserves of fossil fuels. While excessiv e exposur e to nuclear radiations is harmful, safe work practices, safe and well-designed nuclear plants and stringent regulat ory contr ol can bring down the risks due to radiation exposur e to negligible levels. International points of entry are vulnerable to accidents involving radio-nuclear activity due to their vicinity to the nuclear reactors, potential of radio-nuclear substances for terror attack and many times, covert natur e of radiation exposur e. To prevent, protect against and treat injuries due to accidents involving radio-nuclear substances is a priority area. TYPES OF ACCIDENTS: A nuclear accident involves nuclear fission, especially in a nuclear reactor. This covers accidents in nuclear reactors, 'criticality ' situations in fuel cycle facilities, nuclear explosions, etc. Currently 21 nuclear reactors are there in India distribut ed in the radiological accident , on the other hand, involves a release of ionizing radiation (X-ray equipment or sealed sources like 60Co, 137Cs or 192Ir in tele-therapy equipment, industrial radiography cameras or irradiat ors) or dischar ge of radio active materials (unsealed sources used in nuclear medicine and scientific resear ch) into the envir onment. Examples of such emer gencies are the accidents that took place at Goiania in Brazil, San Salvador, Istanbul in Turkey, Panama, etc. Radiological accidents may occur in the following situations: (a)A radio active source (in tele-therapy equipment or industrial radiography cameras) may be stolen, lost, misplaced or sold and may come into the possession of unsuspecting people thereby exposing them and possibly other s to radiation. (b)A radio active sour ce (in t ele-therapy equipment, industrial radiography cameras or irradiat ors) may fail to get retract ed after use and may remain unshielded, exposing the operat or to high levels of radiation. (c)Contamination through leak or break in vial containing radio active material in a nuclear medicine facility . (d)Transpor tation accidents involving radio active materials. Eight nuclear/ radiological emergency scenarios envisaged in the disaster planning are listed below: Accidents in Nuclear Power Plants and other facilities in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle 'Criticality ' Accidents (If Critical Mass o f fissile mat erial is achiev ed) Accidents during T ranspor tation o f Radio active Mat erials Accidents at facilities using Radio active Sour ces Disint egration o f Satellites during R e-Entr y Nuclear/Radiological T errorism and Sabotage at Nuclear F acilities State-Sponsor ed Nuclear T errorism Explosion o f Nuclear W eaponsRADIA TION UNITS: The universally accept ed (SI unit) of the absorbed dose is Gray (Gy). In order to comp are the damaging potential of differ ent kinds of radiation and to assess the damage caused, the equiv alent dose is used. The SI unit of the equiv alent dose is Sievert (Sv). Factors affecting the effects of radiation on human body are enlist ed in Table no. 6.1 Type o f Injur y 1. Exposure to radiation - The affect ed per son is not a sour ce of radiation. 2. Contamination: radio active substance getting deposit ed on the skin/ clothing or gaining entry into the body through airway, mouth or through the intact or broken skin. Dose rate 1. Acute- as a single dose 2. Fractionated- in divided doses as in case of radiotherapy 3. Protracted - over a long period of time Type of radiation 1. Alpha (\u00e1) particles- have intense ionization effect if they get involved incorporat ed in the body following inhalation, ingestion or through open wounds. However, it does not penetrat e the outer horny layer of skin. 2. Beta (\u00e2) particles- penetrat e 1 centimet er (cm) in tissue. They can give rise to severe burns (also called \u00e2 burns). 3. Gamma (\u00e3) and X rays travel many cm in tissue and eventually pass through the body . They cause harm to the deeper structur es and vital organs, including the bone marrow, giving rise to systemic effects of \"Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)\" . Tissue sensitivity Highly sensitiv e cells/ tissues are lymphocyt es, the fast dividing cells of the bone marrow and the cells lining the intestinal villi. The nerve tissue, by contrast, is the most radio resistant tissue. Dose distribution: 1. Whole body exposur e (causing Acute Radiation Syndrome) 2. A localized exposur e (causing radiation burns) 3.The pattern of deposition or incorporation (internal contamination) of radio active material in the body . Half Life Radio active materials decrease in activity over time (radio active decay), thereby transforming into a more stable form. Half life is the time taken for activity of radio active substance to reduce to half. Syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s , Table no. 6.1 FACTORS AFFECTING EFFECTS OF RADIA TION A. B. C. D. E.

Table no. 6.2 enlists some deterministic effects of irradiation and their threshold. Chromosomal aberrations 100 mGy Gonads (Sterility after 2 months in males) Temporar y 1 Gy Permanent 6 Gy Cataract in Lens(appear s in 2-3 yrs) 5 Gy (Under revision to 500 mGy) Skin > 3 Gy Haemopoietic 1 - 8 Gy ACUTE RADIA acute high dose (\u00a1\u00dd 1 Gy) exposur e of penetrating radiation like \u00e3 radiation or x-rays to the major portion of the body can give rise to a clinical entity of \"Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)\" . ARS is typically divided into four phases: 1.Prodromal Phase: The condition is heralded by a prodromal phase which may be mark ed by nausea, vomiting (indicating Hemat opoietic involvement), diarrhea (indicating Gastrointestinal involvement), prostration, giddiness (indicating Cardiovascular involvement), imbalance and convulsions (indicating Central nervous system involvement) in increasing order of severity. The time of onset of vomiting and its severity may give an indication of the dose receiv ed by the person as described in the Table no. 6.3. As lymphocyt es ar e extr emely sensitiv e to radiation exposur e, depleting absolut e lymphocyt e counts can also provide a good guidance about the dose during this phase.Table no. 6.2 Deterministic effects of irradiation and their threshold.

With good medical and nursing care, the person may recover or death may ensue due to bleeding and infection in 2 months. 3.2 Gastro intestinal syndrome (8-30 Gy): The injury to intestinal mucosal stem cells gives rise to death due to severe diarrhea leading to severe dehydration, electr olyte disturb ances, infection and death in 2 weeks. 3.3 Neurov ascular syndrome (>30 Gy): The low blood pressur e and swelling of the brain and injury to various other vital organs like lungs, kidneys and liver results and only terminal care remains possible. Death may occur in 2 days. 3.Recov ery Phase or Death RADIA TION EFFECTS ON THE SKIN This is also known as Cutaneous Radiation Syndrome (CRS) or Cutaneous Radiation Injury (CRI). Handling of highly radio active sources (e.g. placing a hand in the beam of industrial radiography camera) may give rise to a very high dose locally . As opposed to thermal burn, the signs of radiation burn may take several days to appear and healing is delay ed beyond months. Blood supply to the site can get affect ed due to narrowing of blood vessels and hence they evolve very slowly and can be deceptiv e in appearance vis-\u00e0-vis thermal burns. The insufficient blood supply due to damage to underlying blood vessels may result in breaking down of previously healed skin. Skin changes in absence of contact with corrosives, heat or insect bites should arouse suspicion of a radiation injury. Further, the immunity may be suppr essed. Radiation burns need prolonged management with frequent follow-ups. : 89 :Figure no. 6.2.

Excision of tissue and amputation in case of large areas of necrosis and gangr ene. RADIO ACTIVE C ONTAMINA TION Radiation Exposur e (irradiation) and contamination are often confused. Radiation is energy, which, after causing the damage, does not remain in the body , wher eas contamination is the physical presence of a radio active material. Radio active contamination, as against radiation exposur e, is impor tant from the public health point of view. It is called External Contamination when there is presence of this material on shoes, clothing or on skin/hair Figure no. 6.3 External and Internal Contamination. : 90 :EXTERNAL DECONTAMINA TION Objectiv es: (a)To reduce the surface dose rate. (b)To prevent the activity from entering the body . (c)To prevent contamination fr om spr eading t o other per sons or objects. DECONTAMINA TION PR OCEDURE: Figure no. 6.4 Decontamination as issued by CDC. : 91 : 1. First Aid The person should be stabilized physiologically befor e decontamination is attempt ed. Place: Decontamination should be carried out at the site of the accident preferably in separate place earmark ed for this purpose. It should be easily accessible t o the ext erior o f the building to ensur e minimum spread of contamination when the patient arrives. The floor of the room should be easily washable or should be covered with polythene sheets. The room should have water supply , low- level sink for collection of contaminat ed water, and a place for monit oring instruments. Elimination of 90% of contamination is achiev ed by remov al of clothing alone. Over- aggressiv e and over- zealous treatment should be avoided in order to prevent injury to the natural barrier s of the skin resulting in enhanced absorption. Measur es like remov al of contaminat ed clothing at the site of accident, show er bath, administration of first aid for internal contamination should be done at the first aid befor e sending patient to site hospital. Measur es to reduce absorption: 1.Stomach wash- To remov contaminant befor e getting absorbed. 2.Inducing vomiting. 3.Laxativ e- To hasten the movement through the intestines to reduce the time of contact of the contaminant in the gut. Generally , trained Health Physics Staff does the monit oring. The doctor is requir ed in case of persistent contamination with associat ed injury or contamination of sensitiv e parts of the body; e.g. eyes, nose, mouth etc. INTERNAL C ONTAMINA TION (INC ORPORA TION) Usually this follows disper sal of powdered, liquid, or gaseous radio active material. Effectiv e treatment requir es knowledge of both the radionuclide and its chemical form. Effectiv eness of treatment is dependent on an early treatment. It can occur due to accidental intak e of a radioisot ope by Inhalation, Ingestion, Injection (or absorption through broken/ intact skin). DECORPORA TION Early effectiv e decontamination of internal contamination can considerably reduce late effects of inhaled or ingest ed radionuclides. Decorporation has to be carried out using specific antidot es (Table no. 6.4). : 92 :Table no. 6.4 Specific treatment for internal contamination. S.

Another organisation United Nations Scientific Committee on Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCE AR), since 1955, has been scientifically evaluating the sources of radiation like natural background radiation, medical exposur es and effects like cancer , DNA change, systemic effects on immune system, cardiovascular system and assessing the risk posed by such low level exposur es. 2.

DISASTERS INTR ODUCTION Multi-Hazard Vulnerability India, due to its, physiographic and climatic conditions is one of the most disast er prone areas around the globe. Nearly 59 per cent of the landmass is prone to earthquak es ranging from moderat e to very high intensity . More than 40 million hectar es (12 per cent of land) is prone to floods and river erosions. Of the nearly 7500 km long coastline, close to 5700 km is prone to cyclones and tsunamis. Nearly 68 percent of the cultiv able area is vulnerable to drought. Large tracts in hilly regions are at risk from landslides and some ar e prone t o snow av alanches. V ulnerability t o disast ers/ emer also exists. Height ened vulnerabilities to disast er risks can be related to expanding population, urbanization and industrialization, dev elopment within high-risk zones, envir onmental degradation, and climat e change. (17) DISASTERS The UNISDR (2009) defines disast er: A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespr ead human, material, economic or envir onmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affect ed community or society to cope using its own resour ces. The DM Act 2005 uses the following definition for disast er: \"Disast er\" means a catastr ophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurr ence in any area, arising from natural or manmade causes, or by accident or negligence which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to, and destruction of, proper ty, or damage to, or degradation of, envir onment, and is of such a natur e or magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area.\" Emergency - An emer gency is a severe event, causes damage to infrastructur e, economic and social structur es, or human health, and requir es external assistance. \"All disaster s are emer gencies but not all emer gencies are disaster s\"Natural hazar ds can be classified into five major categories as enlist ed in Table no. 7.1 Categor y Events Geophysical Earthquak e, Volcano, Tsunami Hydr ological Flood, Landslides, Wave Action Meteorological Events caused by short-lived/small to meso-scale atmospheric processes (in the spectrum from minut es to days). Cyclone, Storm Surge, Tornado, Conv ective Storm, Extratr opical Storm, Wind, Cold Wave, Derecho, Extreme Temperatur e, Fog, Frost, Freeze, Hail, Heat- wave, Lightning, Heavy Rain, Sand-S torm, Dust-S by long-liv ed meso- to macr processes (in intra-seasonal multi-decadal e variability . E.g. Drought, Extreme hot/cold conditions, Forest/Wildfir e Fires, Glacial Lake Outbur st, Subsidence Biological Epidemics: viral, bacterial, parasitic, Infections, Insect infestations, Animal stampedes Primarily disast ers are trigger ed by natural hazar ds or human-induced, or result from a combination of both. Disast ers are typically classified into distinct categories based on their origin. The following describes these classifications: A. Natural Disaster s Earthquak es Extreme Heat Flood Hurricanes Landslides Tornadoes Tsunamis Volcanoes Wildfir es Wint er Weather B.Technological/Human-Made Disaster s Radiation emer gencies from nuclear blasts, nuclear reactor accidents, or accidental spills of radio active material Radiation emer gencies from nuclear blasts, nuclear reactor accidents, or accidental spills of radio active material Bioterrorism Oil spills Bombing or destr oying a nuclear reactor Table no. 7.1 Classification of Natural hazards S. no. 1 2 3 4 5 : 104 :C. Complex Emergencies War Famine Drought Conflicts Displaced Populations DISASTER MANA GEMENT Disast er management is a continuous and integrat ed process of planning, organising, coordinating and implementing measur es which are necessar y or expedient for the following: 1)Prevention of danger or threat of any disast er, 2)Mitigation or reduction of risk of any disast er or its severity or consequences, 3)Capacity-building, 4)Preparedness to deal with any disast er, 5)Prompt response to any threatening disast er situation or disast er, 6)Assessing the severity or magnitude of effects of any disast er 7)Evacuation, rescue and relief, 8)Rehabilitation and r econstruction Figure no. 7.1 Disaster Management Cy cle : 105 :1st Phase - Mitigation - The mitigation phase is the sustained action or development of policies that reduce or eliminat e risk to humans and proper ty from a disast er. During the mitigation phase, identified risks and population vulnerabilities are carefully review ed to develop strategies to prevent reoccurr ence of the similiar type of disast er in the futur e or limit the effect from such disast ers. Existing preparedness plans are review ed and revised to enhance the preparation effor ts. There are few examples of activities that could take place during the mitigation phase are building or strengthening dams and levees, establishing better and safer building codes, purchasing fire insurance, and updating land use zoning. Though the sequence of events that take place following a disast er have a specific priority , many activities happen simultaneously . Similarly , some activities related to disast er response and recovery can extend for long periods. This is evident in continued effor ts to manage the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant disaster that continues to plague the area over 30 years later with continued health risks and envir onmental cleanup. nd 2 Phase -Prep aredness - The preparedness phase includes the development of plans designed to save lives and to minimize damage when a disast er occur s. Disast er prevention and preparedness measur es should be developed and put in place long befor e a disast er strikes. Preparedness plans should be developed based on the identification of potential disast ers and the related risks associat ed with these disast ers. When possible, this should include hazar d mapping to specif y locations at high risk for specific disast ers. The plan should include training o f health per sonnel, community member s, and other pot ential primar y-responder s, as well as establishing systems for communicating warnings to the community . Strategies for evacuating at risk communities befor e impending disast ers should be well thought out and communicat ed to community member s. Weather patterns, geophysical activities, terrorist activities, industrial activities, wars, and other activities associat ed with a potential disast er should be monit ored so that officials can anticip ate impact, issue timely warnings and, when possible, evacuat e at-risk populations. This phase should also include an inventory of available resour ces to respond to a potential disast er. An inventory will help to estimat e the additional resour ces requir ed and speed up the mobilization of resour ces following a disast er. Finally , partnerships should form in the preparedness phase to establish alliances, outline respectiv e roles and define everyone 's responsibilities. rd 3 Phase -Response - The response phase is the actions taken to save lives and prevent further damage in a disast er. This phase begins immediat ely after a disast er has struck . During the response phase, plans developed in the preparedness phase are put into action. While some disast ers last only for a few seconds (e.g., earthquak es, explosions), other s might last for several days, weeks, or even months (e.g., floods, droughts). The primar y focus of the response phase is to provide relief and take action to reduce further morbidity and mortality . Such actions include providing first aid and medical assistance, implementing search and rescue effor ts, restoring transpor tation and communication networks, conducting public health surveillance, and evacuating people who are still vulnerable to the effects of the disast er. Also during this phase necessar y supplies, including food and water, are distribut ed to survivors. : 106 :th 4 Phase - Recov ery - As the immediat e needs o f the disast er are addr essed and the emer gency phase ends, the focus o f the disast er effor ts shifts to recovery. The recovery phase includes the actions taken to return the community to normal following a disast er. Actions during this phase include repair and maint enance of basic health services, including sanitation and water systems; repair, replace or rebuild proper ty; and the proper management of dead bodies. Proper care of dead bodies is necessar y; it helps in minimizing the psychosocial effects on families. The management of dead bodies involves a series of activities that begin with the search for corpses, In situ identification of bodies, transfer to a facility serving as a morgue, deliv ery of the body to family member s, and assistance from local health authorities for the final disposal of the body in accor dance with the wishes o f the family and the r eligious and cultural norms o f the community . Documenting the cause o f death, manner of death, and relationship to the disast er is impor tant to better under stand the human health effects of a disast er. While many disast ers happen suddenly with little or no warning (e.g., earthquak e, tornado, landslide), other s are preceded by warning signs (e.g., Tsunamis, hurricane, flood, draught). Complex disast ers, such as famine, war, and global climat e change can be slow to take effect and can extend over a long period. Role of public health exper ts or epidemiologists during disast ers is the use of core public health capabilities to assess the needs of affect ed populations and provide timely and accurat e health information to decision makers, and identif y risk factors and improve prevention and mitigation strategies for futur e disast er. Managing emergencies - through PH-EOC/SHOC A public health emer gency defined as an occurr ence, or imminent threat, of an illness or health condition that poses a substantial risk of a significant number of human fatalities, injuries or permanent or long- term disability . Public health emer gencies can result from a wide range of hazar ds and complex emer gencies. Experience has shown that timely implementation of an Emer gency Operations Centr e (EOC) provides an essential platform for the effectiv e management of public health emer gencies. Public health emer gencies involve increased incidence of illness, injury and/or death and requir e special measur es to address increased morbidity , mortality and interruption of essential health services. For such emer gencies, a multi-agency , multi-jurisdictional response is often requir ed, working with the national disast er management organization. When normal resour ces and capacities are exceeded, suppor t from outside the affect ed areas will also be requir ed. External assistance could include national, cross-bor der, regional or international resour ces. The Strategic Health Operations Centr e (SHOC) EOC is a physical location or virtual space in which designat ed emer gency management and response functions are performed, suppor ted by appropriat e legislation and regulations, and designed and resour ced with sustainability in mind. SHOC plays a vital role in the coordination of information and resour ces for efficient and effectiv e responses. SHOC may be a temporar y facility , like field SHOC or may be established in a fixed location. SHOC/ EOC aims to strengthen the public health preparedness and response to natural disast ers and infectious disease outbreaks & chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear-explosive (CBRNE) emer gencies (All Hazar d approach) in state, district & sub district level. The SHOC/ EOC would be a centralized location for the public health response of state, district & corporation to collect, analyze and display epidemiology , laborat ory, surveillance and rapid response team information and critical resour ces : 107 :deployed, in order to coordinat e public health emer gency response operations. Providing a single point of communication & coordination, the establishment of a centralized SHOC/ EOC will enhance state, district & corporation 's capability to monit or health information, identif y unusual health events and quickly respond to public health emer gencies that affect life and proper ty. Purpose of SHOC/ EOC The SHOC/ EOC are nodal point of a compr ehensiv e public health emer gency management response. Its purpose is to: I.Collect, analyze, display , monit or, and disseminat e esponse data and information a.Sources: Epidemiological, laborat ory, disease surveillance, Rapid Response Teams, POEs, GIS, broadcast and toll free call centr es, print & electr onic media scanning, etc. II.Communicat e, collaborat e and coordinat e response activities from a centralized location with intersectoral and interagency partners across international, national, state and district & sub district levels. III.Identif y, organize, deploy and track resour ces. IV.Deploy Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) or Incident Management staff to the SHOC/ EOC and the field. a.Suppor t the Districts during an emer gency response. b.Contact tracing. Advantage of SHOC/ EOC Interconnect ed SHOC/ EOC' s at the national, stat e, and district & POE lev el allow for incr eased capacity to respond effectiv ely to public health risks and public health emer gencies of international concern and provide a streamlined notification process for the international community The SHOC/ EOC provides one central location for decision makers and key partners to meet and manage a public health emer gency response and rapidly share information All data and information needed for executiv e response decisions are available in real-time. Standar dized response plans and standar d operating procedur es can provide a roadmap for how SHOC/EOC can functions during an emer gency response. A dashbo ard displaying routine and response surveillance data can help to develop a common operating pictur e during an emer gency response Knowledge of critical resour ces and patterns of disease transmission will suppor t the rapid response teams field response An Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is a central command and contr ol facility responsible for carrying out the principles of emer gency preparedness and emer gency management, or disast er management functions at a strategic level during an emer gency , and ensuring the continuity of operation of a contr ol room, political subdivision or other organization. : 108 :An EOC is responsible for the strategic overview, or \"big pictur e\", of the disast er, and does not normally directly contr ol field assets, instead making operational decisions and leaving tactical decisions to lower commands. The common functions of all EOC' s is to collect, gather and analyze data; make decisions that protect life and proper ty, maintain continuity of the organization, within the scope of applicable laws; and disseminate those decisions to all concerned agencies and individuals. In most EOC' s there is one individual in charge, and that is the Emer gency Manager . The first most critical component of an EOC is the individuals who staff it. They must be well trained, and have the proper authority to carry out actions that are necessar y to respond to the disast er. They also must be capable of thinking out of the box, and creating a lot of \"what if\" scenarios. The local EOC' s function during an emer gency is to suppor t the incident commander . The second most critical component of an EOC is its communications system . This can be from simple word of mouth, to sophisticat ed encrypted communications networks, but it must provide for a redundant path to ensur e that both situational awar eness information and strategic orders can pass into and out of the facility without interruption. For continuity of operations considerations, backbone components of the communications system are not normally locat ed at the EOC. A number of EOC facilities are incorporating radio over IP technology to provide a coher ent assembly of various radios, interoperability with various radio technologies, and integration with telephone systems. Emergency Operations Centre- Uses principles of Incident Command System (ICS) The Incident Command System, or ICS, helps to ensur e integration of public health response effor ts. ICS is a standar dized, on-scene, all-hazar ds approach to incident management. It enables a coordinat ed response among various jurisdictions and agencies. It establishes common processes for planning and managing resour ces. It allows for the integration of facilities, equipments, personnel, procedur es, and communications operating within a common organizational structur e. ICS was developed in the 1970s following a series of catastr ophic fires in California. Proper ty damage ran into the millions, and many people died or were injured. The personnel assigned to determine the causes of these disast ers studied the case histories and discov ered that response problems could rarely be attribut ed to lack of resour ces or failur e of tactics. ICS can be used to manage: Natural hazar ds. Technological hazar ds. Human-caused hazar ds. Planned events (Mass gatherings.) Biological threats Disease outbr eaks (Incident - An incident is an occurrenc e or event, natur al or human-caus ed that requires a respons e to protect life or proper ty) Incident Command System What- Provides a consist ent framework of managing emer gencies. Who- To enable central, state, district & local governments, private sector & NGOs to work in coordination. . : 109 :How to- prepare for prevent, detect, respond to, recover from, and mitigat e the effects of incidents regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity . Why- In order to reduce the loss of life and proper ty, and harm to the envir onment. ICS helps to ensure: The safety of responder s, exper ts, work ers, and other s. The achiev ement of response objectiv es. The efficient use of resour ces. Without ICS? Lack of accountability , including unclear chains of command and super vision. Poor communication, due to both inefficient uses of available communications systems and conflicting codes and terminology . Lack of an orderly , systematic planning process. No common, flexible, predesigned management structur e that enabled commander s to delegat e responsibilities and manage worklo ads efficiently . No pr edefined methods t o integrat e interagency r equir ements int o the management structur e and planning pr ocess effectiv ely.

Realisation of certain shortcomings in our response system and a desir e to address the critical gaps led the Government of India (GoI) to look at the world' s best practices. The GoI found that the system evolved for firefighting in California is very compr ehensiv e and thus decided to adopt Incident Command System : 111 :(ICS). A compr ehensiv e set of Guidelines has thus been prepared and is called the Incident Response System (IRS) . The Incident Response System (IRS) is an effectiv e mechanism for reducing the scope for ad-hoc measur es in response. It incorporat es all the tasks that may be performed during DM irrespectiv e of their level of complexity . It envisages a composit e team with various Sections to attend to all the possible response requir ements. The IRS identifies and designat es officer s to perform various duties and get them trained in their respectiv e roles. If IRS is put in place and stakeholder s trained and made awar e of their roles, it will greatly help in reducing chaos and confusion during the response phase. Everyone will know what needs to be done, who will do it and who is in command, etc. IRS is a flexible system and all the Sections, Branches and Units need not be activated at the same time. Various Sections, Branches and Units need to be activated only as and when they are requir ed. The main purpose of these Guidelines is to lay down the roles and responsibilities of differ ent functionaries and stakeholder s, at State and District levels and how coordination with the multi-tier ed institutional mechanisms at the National, State and District level will be done. It also emphasises the need for proper documentation of various activities for better planning, accountability and analysis. It will also help new responder s to immediat ely get a compr ehensiv e pictur e of the situation and go in for immediat e action. The IRS organisation functions through Incident Response Teams (IRTs) in the field. In line with our administrativ e structur e and DM Act 2005, Responsible Officer s (ROs) have been designat ed at the State and District level as overall in charge of the incident response management. The RO may however delegat e responsibilities to the Incident Commander (IC), who in turn will manage the incident through IRTs. The IRTs will be pre-designat ed at all levels; State, District, Sub-Division and Tehsil/Block . On receipt of Early Warning, the RO will activate them. In case a disast er occur s without any warning, the local IRT will respond and contact R O for fur ther suppor t, if requir ed. A Nodal Officer (NO) has t o be designat ed for proper coordination betw een the District, State and National level in activating air suppor t for response. Apart from the RO and Nodal Officer (NO), the IRS has two main components; a) Command Staff and b) General Staff as shown Figur e no. 7.2 Incident Response Teams Incident Response Teams are to be set up right from the State to the District, Sub-division and Block levels. The co-or dination process betw een the National, State and District has also been clearly described. Presently the process for the institutionalization of the system is going on through various sensitization and training pr ograms launched all ov er the countr y by the NDMA. Up till now 30 Districts in 15 S tates have already been covered wher e 3115 officer s have been given initial training and teams have been formed at differ ent levels. This program has also been started in the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration and the Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, National Police Academy wher e up till now 1768 officer s have been trained on the Incident Response System. EOC- FUNCTIONS I-Information management: Speedy display of impor tant data, graphs and pictur es, and fast transmission of early warning and alert messages are necessar y in order for stakeholder s to make rapid decisions based on accurat e information.

The EOC/SHOC brings t ogether scientists and SMEs fr om differ ent agencies/institut es to analyze, validat e, and efficiently ex change information during a public health emer gency and connect with emer gency r esponse p artners. Figure no. 7.6 Incident Command and Control S tructure : 114 :For a well coordinat ed response system there should be a clearly defined chain of command and organizational structur e, effectiv e resour ce management, and advanced planning are impor tant aspects of an emer gency response. In public health EOC typical terminology used for response is Incident Management System (IMS), it \"manages not command\" the response as in comp arison to incident command system. An IMS is a standar d structur e based on ICS principles that is used in large and small-scale incidents at national, state, and sub district level. Public health agencies have adapt ed IMS principles in managing their responses to public health emer gencies, which in addition to the command, operations, logistics, planning, and finance/administrativ e functions, also includes scientific/public health response roles. Figure no. 7.7 National Command and Control S tructure (P oE) A defined command and contr ol structur e to enables an efficient decision-making process. Distinctly defined functions are managed and coordinat ed by teams under the direction of an Incident Commander/Manager . In general, functions covered by a command and contr ol structur e. It may set community level priorities and certainly during the recovery phase may have more of a \"direction and contr ol\" function once the response phase is complet ed. Emergency Response Activ ation Levels Level-I-The highest level of response reserved for critical emer gencies. Response requir es the largest number of staff possible to work 24/7 on the response. Major event, Multiple sites, Regional disast er, multiple agencies involved, Extensiv e evacuations and Resour ce suppor t requir ed. Level-II- (Partial) -Moderate event, Two or more sites, several agencies involved, Major scheduled event (e.g., mass gathering), Limit ed evacuations and Resour ce suppor t requir ed. Level-III (Monitor)- Small incident or event, one site, Two or more agencies involved, Potential threat of Flood, Severe storm, Interface fire and Escalating incident. During EOC/ SHOC should have the ability to rapidly transpor t life-suppor ting medications, samples and specimens, and personnel anywher e in the countr y around the clock within set timeframe of notification. Conclusion: This brief overview of disast er and EOC/ SHOC gives an an idea to use ICS principles for managing public health emer gencies in a scientific way. : 115 :7.1 CBRN E VENTS Back ground Recent effor ts to improve preparedness & IHR core capacities in India, have included a focus on the potential for radiological, chemical, nuclear and blast injury events. Each of these types of incidents is associat ed with unique injury patterns and clinical management needs. The number s of medical, nursing and paramedical personnel adequat ely trained to manage the medical consequences of radiological, nuclear , chemical and blast incidents are extremely low. The experience base is also shallow because of the relativ ely low incidence of exposur es to many of these hazar ds. Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons can produce mass casualties if not effectiv ely disseminat ed, but have varying and differ ent effects. Chemical weapons, predominantly man-made chemicals, requir e the largest amount of material to be effectiv e and cause their effects in minut es to hour s. Biological weapons made of naturally occurring pathogens requir e the least material to be effectiv e, but generally have an incub ation period of several days befor e sympt oms show themselv es. Radiological mat erials that can cr eate a hazar d with the pot ential t o injur e and kill per sonnel can come from any radio active source. While nuclear detonations produce large amounts of radio activity and a significant hazar d, radiological attacks do not create a nuclear blast. Radiological weapons could contain virtually any type o f radio active mat erial and disper se only the amount o f mat erial originally contained within the device. Sour ces o f radiological mat erial include medical and industrial equipment and wast e and may originat e in countries having insufficient contr ol of these materials. Treatment protocols for chemical, biological, Radiological & nuclear weapons vary by agent, ranging from weapons with effectiv e treatment and prophylaxis to weapons which have neither known cure nor protection. CBRNE weapons pose additional concerns beyond mass casualties. These weapons may contaminat e the area in which they are used, emer gency vehicles, and first responder s. The wide array of potential sympt oms from CBRN weapons makes identification of the causal agent difficult and complicat es treatment. Additionally , public fears relating to disease and poisoning could increase the effect of CBRN attack , as worried, unexposed people request treatment from medical facilities. In extreme cases, public hysteria has been postulat ed as an outcome from mass dissemination. Several initiativ es are under way to reduce the potential value of CBRNE weapons. One approach has been through funding significant increases in the public health system's preparedness and response capacity. : 116 :BOX NO . 7.1.1 CBRN E VENTS IN THE P AST The recent catastr ophic suspect ed chemical weapon attack in Syria and of September 11, 2001 the anthrax mailings have sensitized countries across the globe to gear up the capacity to be prepared for any such incidents. In March of 2011, the Nation of Japan suffer ed a 9.0 magnitude earthquak e that produced a tsunami. The earthquak e and tsunami significantly damaged several nuclear power reactors along the east coast of Japan. The damaged reactors released radio activity requiring the evacuation of residents within a 50-mile radius. During April 2011, in India, 7 civilians were exposed to radiation inadv ertently . This incident, in which radio active scrap material found its way to a busy mark et in New Delhi, emphasizes community vulnerability to a wide range of threats from radiological incidents. More recently , the unint entional theft of a cobalt-60 medical therapy device in Mexico, reminded us of the challenges related to medical response to such incidents. The 1984 Bhop al disast er in India, also known as the Bhop al Gas Tragedy was one of the world' s worst industrial catastr ophes. A leak of methyl isocyanat e (MIC) gas and other chemicals from the Union Carbide India Limit ed (UCIL) pesticide plant, result ed in hundr eds of thousands of people being exposed to the chemical along with a death toll that number ed in the thousands. The results of these disast ers highlight the need for adequat ely trained responder s in the areas of radiological and chemical emer gencies. Over the past several years, many high-pr ofile attacks in major metr opolitan areas in India and worldwide (Mumb ai, Delhi, Pune, Ahmedab ad, Varanasi, London, Madrid etc.) have involved bombings in highly populat ed venues. Mark ets, restaurants, trains, buses and hotels are just a few of the types of places that have been affect ed with blast events. An increase in the number of trained medical personnel to manage the resulting blast injuries is acutely needed. These and other disast ers have exposed deficiencies in the organizational capacity and capability to respond effectiv ely and efficiently to a multitude of public health issues and then manage the consequences in domestic and international envir onments. Historically CBRNE is a mnemonic for Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear and Explosiv e hazar ds or injuries. It replaces and expands the term used during the cold war NBC. Some of these agents were used or developed by the militar y like classic agents Nerve Agents, Sulfur Mustar d, Lewisit e. Other s have dual use in industr y as well like Chlorine and Phosgene as well as by the militar y. Some are single use like Nerve Agents that have no other industrial use. TICs and TIMs examples include industrial chemicals that are available in our cities and towns like ammonia or hydrofluoric acid or flammable chemicals like propane or gasoline. The term 'CBRN Defense ' is used in reference to CBRN passiv e protection, contamination avoidance, and CBRN mitigation. Chemical disaster s are occurr ence of emission, fire or explosion involving one or more hazar dous chemicals in the course of industrial activity (handling), storage or transpor tation or due to natural events leading to serious effects inside or outside the installation likely to cause loss of life and proper ty including adverse effects on the envir onment. : 117 :Biological Disaster s Biological disast ers are scenarios inv olving disease, disability or death on a lar ge scale among humans, animals and plants due to toxins or disease caused by live organisms or their products. Such disast ers may be natural in the form of epidemics or pandemics of existing, emer ging or re-emer ging diseases and pestilences or man-made by the intentional use of disease causing agents in Biological Warfare (BW) operations or incidents of Bioterrorism (BT). Nuclear or Radiological Disaster When the impact of a nuclear or radiological emer gency , caused by a nuclear attack (as happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan) or large-scale release of radio activity from nuclear/ radiological facilities (like that at Chernobyl in Ukraine) is very high, it assumes the dimension of a nuclear disast er leading to mass casualties and destruction of large areas and proper ty. Unlik e a nuclear emer gency , the impact of a nuclear disast er is beyond the coping capability of local authorities and such a scenario calls for handling at the national level, with assistance from international agencies, if requir ed. A Nuclear and/or Radiological Emergency (NRE) is an incident resulting in, or having a potential to result in, exposur e to and/or contamination of the work ers or the public, in excess of the respectiv e permissible limits. : 118 :7.2MEDICAL RESPONSE DURING CBRNE EMER GENCIES CBRNE incidents call for the decontamination, immediat e remov al of the unabsorbed contaminant from the body of victim, follow ed by treatment of a significant number s of casualties while ensuring the safety of the responder . The training through mock exercise needs to be conduct ed to hone skills and develop reflexes of the responder s, so that they can promptly remov e victim from the 'agent' source and also remov e 'agent from' contaminat ed personnel. The key of success is swiftness and correctness. Other impor tant commandments are as follows: Triage - prioritization patients based on clinical condition. Resuscitat e and treat patients as per triage. Decontaminat e the victims so as to prevent spread of contamination. Transpor t victims on priority as per triage classification. Re-triage constantly (a dynamic process) throughout all the phases of management. Only move the dead when it is affecting the response.
