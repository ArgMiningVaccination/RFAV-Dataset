State of Maryland is pleased to provide you with this Evidence of Coverage (EOC ), which describes the health Benef its available to you and your eligible dependents . It includes summaries of: who is eligible; services that are covered, called Covered Health Services; services that are not covered, called Exclusions; how Benefits are paid; and your rights and responsibi lities under the Plan. This EOC is designed to meet your information needs . It supersedes any previous printed or electronic EOC for this Plan. IMPORTANT The healthcare service, supply or Pharmaceutical Product is only a Covered Health Service if it is Medically Necessary. (See definit ions of Medically Necessary and Covered Health Service in Section 14, Glossary .) The fact that a Physician or other provider has performed or prescribed a procedure or treatment, or the fact that it may be the only available treatment for a Sickness, Injur y, Mental Illness, S ubstance -Related and Addictive Disorders , disease or its symptoms does not mean that the procedure or treatment is a Covered Health Service under the Plan. State of Maryland intends to continue this Plan, but reserves the right, in it s sole discretion, to modify, change, revise, amend or terminate the Plan at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice. This EOC is not to be construed as a contract of or for employment. If there should be an inconsistency between the contents of this summary and the contents of the Plan, your rights shall be determined under the Plan and not under this summary. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN SECTION 1 - WELCOME UnitedHealthcare is a private healthcare claims administrator. UnitedHealthcare's goal is to give you the tools you need to make wise hea lthcare decisions. UnitedHealthcare also helps the State of Maryland to administer claims. Although UnitedHealthcare will assist you in many ways, it does not guarantee any Benefits. State of Maryland is solely responsible for paying Benefits described in this EOC . Please read this EOC thoroughly to learn how the Plan works. If you have questions contact your local Agency Benefit Coordinator or the Employee Benefits Division or call the number on the back of your ID card. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN SECTION 1 - WELCOME How To Use This Evidence of Coverage Read the entire EOC , and share it with your eligible dependents . Then keep it in a safe place for future reference. Many of the sections of this EOC are related to other sections. You may not have all the information you need by reading just one section. You can find copies of your EOC and any future amendments or request printed copies by contacting your Agency Benefit Coordinator or the Employee Benefits Division . Capitalized words in the EOC have special meanings and are defined in Section 14, Glossary . If eligible for coverage, the words \"you\" and \"your\" refer to Covered Persons as defined in Section 14, Glossary . State of Maryland is also referred to as Group. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 4 SECTION 2 - INTRODUCTION SECTION 2 - INTRODUCTION What this section includes: Who's eligible for coverage under the Plan; The factors that impact your cost for coverage; Instructions and timeframes for enrolling yourself and your eligible Dependents; When coverage begins; and When you can make coverage changes under the Plan. Eligibility You are eligible to enroll in the Plan if you are an active state employee, contractual employee, satellite employee or retiree who meets the Group's eligibility criteria. Your eligible Dependents may also participate in the Plan. An eligible Dependent is considered to be: your Spouse, as defined in Section 14, Glossary ; your child who is under age 26, including a biological child, stepchild, a legally adopted child or a child placed for adoption. your g randchild, legal ward or other child relative that is unmarried, living with the employee/retiree and is a tax dependent of the employee/retiree, may be covered thru end of month he/she turns 25; an unmarried child, stepchild or adopted child age 26 or over who is or becomes permanent ly disabled prior to the child reaching age 26 and is dependent upon you. Subsequently, all certifications are lifetime and there is no need for re -certification every two years ; an unmarried grandchild, legal ward or other child relative , living with the employee/retiree and is a tax dependent of the employee/retiree, who is or becomes disabled prior to turning age 25 and is or becomes dependent upon you; or a child who meets the State of Maryland definition of a Dep endent. Note: Your Dependents may not enroll in the Plan unless you are also enrolled. In addition, if you and your Spouse are both covered under the Plan, you may each be enrolled as an Employee or be covered as a Dependent of the other person, but not both. In addition, if you and your Spouse are both covered under the Plan, only one parent may enroll your child as a Dependent. A Dependent also includes a child for whom health care coverage is required through a Qualified Medical Child Support Order or ot her court or administrative order, as described in Section 13, Other Important Information . STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 5 SECTION 2 - INTRODUCTION Cost of Coverage You and State of Maryland share in the cost of the Plan. Your contribution amount depends on the Plan you select and the eligible dependents you choose to enroll. For active state employees, your contributions are deducted from your paychecks on a before -tax basis in most cases. Before -tax dollars come out of your pay before federal income and Social Security taxes are withheld - and in most states, before state and local taxes are withheld. This gives your contributions a special tax advantage and lowers the actual cost to you. Your contributions are subject to review and State of Maryland reserves the right to change your contribution amount from ti me to time. You can obtain your current rate contributions by going to the Department of Budget & Management Employee Benefits Division's website at www.dbm.maryland.gov/benefits . How to Enroll To enrol l, contact your Agency Benefit Coordinator within 60 days of the date you first become eligible for medical Plan coverage. If you do not enroll within 60 days, you will need to wait until the next annual Open Enrollment to make your benefit elections unles s you experience a family status change . Each year during annual Open Enrollment, you have the opportunity to review and change your medical election. Any changes you make during Open Enrollment will become effective the beginning of the plan year . Importa nt If you wish to change your benefit elections following your marriage, birth, adoption of a child, placement for adoption of a child or other family status change, you must contact your Agency Benefit Coordinator (for active state employees, contractual employees, and satellite employees) or the Employee Benefits Division (for retirees) within 60 days of the event. Otherwise, you will need to wait until the next annual Open Enrollment to change your elections. When Coverage Begins Once the Employee Benefi ts Division receives your properly completed enrollment, coverage will begin the first of the month following the event . Coverage for your Dependents will start on the date your coverage begins, provided you have enrolled them in a timely manner. For newly retired employees, coverage begins the first of the month. Coverage for a Spouse or Dependent stepchild that you acquire via marriage becomes effective the first of the month, provided you notify your Agency Benefit Coordinator (for active state employees , contractual employees, and satellite employees) or the Employee Benefits Division (for retirees) within 60 days of your marriage. Coverage for Dependent children acquired through birth, adoption or placement for adoption is effective the date of the fami ly status change , provided you notify your Agency Benefit Coordinator (for active STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 6 SECTION 2 - INTRODUCTION state employees, contractual employees, and satellite employees) or the Employee Benefits Division (for retirees) within 60 days of the birth, adoption, or placement. A newborn will no t be covered until enrolled. The newborn must be enrolled with the Plan within 60 days of birth to have coverage back to birth. Once confirmation of enrollment has been received that the newborn has been enrolled claims will be resubmitted or reprocessed. If You Are Hospitalized When Your Coverage Begins If you are an inpatient in a Hospital, Skilled Nursing Facility or Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility on the day your coverage begins, the Plan will pay Benefits for Covered Health Services related to that Inpatient Stay as long as you receive Covered Health Services in accordance with the terms of the Plan. You should notify UnitedHealthcare within 48 hours of the day your stay begins, or as soon as is reasonably possible. In -Network Benefits are available only if you receive Covered Health Services from In -Network providers. Changing Your Coverage You may make coverage changes during the year only if you experience a change in family status. The change in coverage must be consistent with the change in status (e.g., you cover your Spouse following your marriage, your child following an adoption, etc.). The following are considered family status changes for purposes of the Plan: your marriage or divorce; the birth, adoption, placement for adoption or legal guardianship of a child; a change in your Spouse's employment or involuntary loss of health coverage (other than coverage under the Medicare or Medicaid programs) under another employer's plan; loss of coverage due to the exhaustion of another employ er's COBRA benefits, provided you were paying for premiums on a timely basis; the death of a Dependent; your Dependent child no longer qualifying as an eligible Dependent; a change in your or your Spouse's position or work schedule that impacts eligibility for health coverage; contributions were no longer paid by the employer (This is true even if you or your eligible Dependent continues to receive coverage under the prior plan and to pay the amounts previously paid by the employer); you or your eligible De pendent who were enrolled in an HMO no longer live or work in that HMO's service area and no other benefit option is available to you or your eligible Dependent; benefits are no longer offered by the Plan to a class of individuals that include you or your eligible Dependent; STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 7 SECTION 2 - INTRODUCTION termination of your or your Dependent's Medicaid or State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage as a result of loss of eligibility (you must contact your Agency Benefit Coordinator or the Employee Benefits Division within 60 days of termination); you or your Dependent become eligible for a premium assistance subsidy under Medicaid or CHIP (you must contact your Agency Benefit Coordinator or the Employee Benefits Division within 60 days of determination of subsidy eligibility); a strike or lockout involving you or your Spouse; or a court or administrative order. Unless otherwise noted above, if you wish to change your elections, you must contact your Agency Benefit Coordinator or the Employee Benefits Division within 60 days of the change in family status. Otherwise, you will need to wait until the next annual Open Enrollment. While some of these changes in status are similar to qualifying events under COBRA, you, or your eligible Dependent, do not need to elect COBRA continuation coverage to take advantage of the special enrollment rights listed above. These will also be available to you or your eligible Dependent if COBRA is elected. Note : Any child under age 26 who is placed with you for adoption will be eligible for coverage on the date the child is placed with you, even if the legal adoption is not yet final. If you do not legally adopt the child, all medical Plan coverage for the child will end when the placement ends. No provision will be made for continuing coverage (such as COBRA coverage) for the child. Change in Family Status - Example Jane is married and has two children who qualify as Dependents. At annual Open Enrollment, she elects not to participate in State of Maryland 's medical plan, because her husband, Tom, has family coverage under his employer's medical plan. In June, Tom loses his job as part of a downsizing. As a result, Tom loses his eligibility for medical coverage. Due to this family status change, Jane can elect family medical coverage und er State of Maryland 's medical plan outside of annual Open Enrollment.

Upon completion of Step 3 of your Wellness Activities you and/or your spouse can also earn a $5 reduction on Specialist copays , starting the following month. * Retirees and retirees' spouses for whom Medicare is primary are not eligible to participate, nor are enrolled children even if they are adults. Accessing In-Network and Out-of-Networ k Benefits As a participant in this Plan, you have the freedom to choose the Physician or health care professional you prefer each time you need to receive Covered Health Services. The choices you make affect the amounts you pay, as well as the level of Be nefits you receive and any benefit limitations that may apply. You are eligible for the In -Network level of Benefits under this Plan when you receive Covered Health Services from Physicians and other health care professionals who have contracted with UnitedHealthcare to provide those services. You can choose to receive In -Network Benefits or Out-of-Network Benefits. In-Network Benefits apply to Covered Health Servi ces that are provided by an In -Network Physician or other In -Network provider. Emergency Health Services are always paid as In - Network Benefits. For facility charges, these are Benefits for Covered Health Services that are billed by an In -Network facility and provided under the direction of either a n In- Network or Out -of-Network Physician or other provider. In -Network Benefits include Physician services provided in a n In-Network facility by an In -Network or a n Out -of- Network radiologist, anesthesiologist, p athologist and Emergency room Physician. Out-of-Network Benefits apply to Covered Health Services that are provided by a n Out - of-Network Physician or other Out -of-Network provider, or Covered Health Services that are provided at a n Out -of-Network facility. Generally, when you receive Covered Health Services from an In -Network provider, you pay less than you would if you receive the same care from an Out -of-Network provider. Therefore, in most instances, your out -of-pocket expenses will be less if you use a n In- Network provider. If you choose to seek care outside the Network, the Plan generally pays Benefits at a lower level. You are required to pay the amount that exceeds the Eligible Expense. The amount in excess of the Eligible Expense could be significant, and this amount does not apply to the Out-of-Pocket Maximum. You may want to ask the Out -of-Network provider about their billed charges before you receive care. Emergency services received at an Out -of-Network Hospital are covered at the In -Network lev el. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 10 SECTION 3 - HOW THE PLAN WORKS Health Services from Out-of-Network Providers Paid as In-Network Benefits If specific Covered Health Services are not available from an In -Network provider, you may be eligible to receive In -Network Benefits from a n Out-of-Network provider. In this situation, your In -Network Physician will notify the Claims Administrator and if the Claims Administrator confirms that care is not available from an In -Network provider, the Claims Administrator will work with you and your In -Network Physician to coordinate care through an Out -of-Network provider. Looking for a n In- Network Provider? In addition to other helpful information, www.uhcmaryland.com , UnitedHealthcare's consumer website, contains a directory of health care professionals and facilities in United Healthcare's Network. While In -Network status may change from time to time, www.uhcmaryland.com has the most current source of In -Network information. Use www.uhcmaryland.com to search for Physicians available in your Plan. In-Network Providers UnitedHealthcare or its affiliates arrange for health care providers to participate in a Network. To verify a provider's status or to locate a participating provider, you can call UnitedHealthcare at the toll -free number on your ID card or log onto www.uhcm aryland.com . In-Network providers are independent practitioners and are not employees of State of Maryland or UnitedHealthcare. UnitedHealthcare's credentialing process confirms public information about the providers' licenses and other credentials, bu t does not assure the quality of the services provided. Possible Limitations on Provider Use If UnitedHealthcare determines that health care services are being used in a harmful or abusive manner, UnitedHealthcare has the right to select an In -Network Phys ician to coordinate all of your future Covered Health Services. If you don't make a selection within 31 days of the date you are notified, UnitedHealthcare has the right to select an In -Network Physician for you. In the event that you do not use the In -Network Physician to coordinate all of your care, any Covered Health Services you receive may be paid at the Out-of- Network level. Eligible Expenses State of Maryland has delegated to UnitedHealthcare the initial discretion and authority to decide whether a t reatment or supply is a Covered Health Service and how the Eligible Expenses will be determined and otherwise covered under the Plan. Eligible Expenses are the amount UnitedHealthcare determines that UnitedHealthcare will pay for Benefits. For In-Network B enefits, you are not responsible for any difference between Eligible Expenses and the amount the provider bills. For In -Network Benefits for Covered Health Services provided by an Out -of-Network provider (other than Emergency Health Services or services ot herwise arranged by UnitedHealthcare), you will be responsible to the Out -of-Network Physician or provider for any amount billed that is greater than the STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 11 SECTION 3 - HOW THE PLAN WORKS amount UnitedHealthcare determines to be an Eligible Expense as described below. For Out-of-Network Be nefits, you are responsible for paying, directly to the Out -of-Network provider, any difference between the amount the provider bills you and the amount UnitedHealthcare will pay for Eligible Expenses. Eligible Expenses are determined solely in accordance with UnitedHealthcare's reimbursement policy guidelines, as described in the EOC . For In -Network Benefits , Eligible Expenses are based on the following: When Covered Health Services are received from an In-Network provider, Eligible Expenses are UnitedHeal thcare's contracted fee(s) with that provider. When Covered Health Services are received from an Out-of-Network provider as a result of an Emergency or as arranged by UnitedHealthcare, Eligible Expenses are billed charges unless a lower amount is negotiate d or authorized by law. For Out -of-Network Benefits , Eligible Expenses are based on either of the following: When Covered Health Services are received from an Out-of-Network provider, Eligible Expenses are determined, based on: - Negotiated rates agreed to by the Out -of-Network provider and either UnitedHealthcare or one of UnitedHealthcare's vendors, affiliates or subcontractors, at UnitedHealthcare's discretion. - If rates have not been negotiated, then one of the following amounts: Eligible Expenses are d etermined based on 110% of the published rates allowed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for Medicare for the same or similar service within the geographic market , with the exception of the following: - 50% of CMS for the same or sim ilar laboratory service. - 45% of CMS for the same or similar durable medical equipment, or CMS competitive bid rates. When a rate is not published by CMS for the service, UnitedHealthcare uses an available gap methodology to determine a rate for the serv ice as follows: - For services other than Pharmaceutical Products, UnitedHealthcare uses a gap methodology established by OptumInsight and/or a third party vendor that uses a relative value scale. The relative value scale is usually based on the difficulty, time, work, risk and resources of the service. If the relative value scale(s) currently in use become no longer available, UnitedHealthcare will use a comparable scale(s). UnitedHealthcare and OptumInsight are related companies through common ownership by UnitedHealth Group . Refer to UnitedHealthcare's website at www.uhcmaryland.com for information regarding the vendor that provides the applicable gap fill relative value scale information. - For Pharmaceutical Products, UnitedHealthcare uses gap methodologies that are similar to the pricing methodology used by CMS , and produce fees based on published acquisition costs or average wholesale price for the pharmaceuticals. These STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 12 SECTION 3 - HOW THE PLAN WORKS methodologies are currently created by RJ Health Systems , Thomson Reuters (published in its Red Book ), or UnitedHealthcare based on an internally developed pharmaceutical pricing resource. - When a rate is not published by CMS for the service and a gap methodology does not apply to the service, the Eligible Expense is based on 50% of the prov ider's billed charge. UnitedHealthcare updates the CMS published rate data on a regular basis when updated data from CMS becomes available. These updates are typically implemented within 30 to 90 days after CMS updates its data. IMPORTANT NOTICE : Out -of-Network providers may bill you for any difference between the provider's billed charges and the Eligible Expense described here. When Covered Health Services are received from an In-Network provider, Eligible Expenses are UnitedHealthcare's contracted fee(s ) with that provider. Don't Forget Your ID Card Remember to show your UnitedHealthcare ID card every time you receive health care services from a provider. If you do not show your ID card, a provider has no way of knowing that you are enrolled under the Pl an. Annual Deductible The Annual Deductible is the amount of Eligible Expenses you must pay each calendar year for Covered Health Services before you are eligible to begin receiving Benefits. The Annual Deductible applies only to Out -of-Network Benefits for this Plan. The amounts you pay toward your Annual Deductible accumulate over the course of the calendar year and will be applied toward your out -of-pocket maximum. Amounts paid toward the Annual Deductible for Covered Health Services that are subject to a visit or day limit will also be calculated against that maximum benefit limit. As a result, the limited benefit will be reduced by the number of days or visits you used toward meeting the Annual Deductible. Any amount you pay for medical expenses in the last three months of the previous calendar year, that is applied to the previous Deductible, will be carried over and applied to the current Deductible. This carry -over feature applies to t he individual and family Deductible. Copayment A Copayment (Copay) is the amount you pay each time you receive certain Covered Health Services. The Copay is a flat dollar amount and is paid at the time of service or when billed by the provider. Copays count toward the Copay Out -of-Pocket -Maximum. Copays do not count toward the Annual Deductible. If the Eligible Expense is less than the Copay, you are only responsible for paying the Eligible Expense and not the Copay. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 13 SECTION 3 - HOW THE PLAN WORKS Coinsurance Coinsurance is the percentage of Eligible Expenses that you are resp onsible for paying. Coinsurance is a fixed percentage that applies to certain Covered Health Services after you meet the Annual Deductible. Coinsurance - Example Let's assume that you receive Plan Benefits for outpatient surgery from an Out -of- Network prov ider. Since the Plan pays 7 0% after you meet the Annual Deductible, you are responsible for paying the other 3 0%. This 3 0% is your Coinsurance. Out-of-Pocket Maximum The annual Out -of-Pocket Maximum is the most you pay each calendar year for Covered Health Services. There are separate In -Network and Out -of-Network Out-of-Pocket Maximums for this Plan. If your eligible out -of-pocket expenses in a calendar year exceed the annual maximum, the Plan pays 100% of Eligible Expenses for Covered Health Services for the remainder of the calendar year. Eligible Expenses charged by both In -Network and Out -of-Network providers apply toward both the In -Network individual and family Out -of-Pocket Maximums and the Out -of- Network individual and family Out -of-Pocket M aximums. Copayments have a separate Out -of-Pocket Maximum. The following table identifies what does and does not apply toward your In -Network and Out-of-Network Out-of-Pocket Maximums: Plan Features Applies to the In - Network Out -of- Pocket Maximum? Applies to the Out - of-Network Out - of-Pocket Maximum? Copays Separate Out of Pocket Maximum No No Payments toward the Annual Deductible N/A Yes Coinsurance Payments Yes Yes Charges for non- Covered Health Services No No The amounts of any reductions in Benefits you incur by not obtaining prior authorization as required No No Charges that exceed Eligible Expenses No No STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 14 SECTION 3 - HOW THE PLAN WORKS How the Plan Works - Example The foll owing example illustrates how Annual Deductibles, Copays, Out -of-Pocket Maximums and Coinsurance work in practice. Let's say Gary has individual coverage under the Plan. He has not met his Out -of-Network Annual Deductible and needs to see a Physician. The flow chart below shows what happens when he visits an In- Network Primary Care Physician versus an Out -of-Network Primary Care Physician. In-Network Benefits Out-of-Network Benefits | | 1. Gary goes to see an In-Network Primary Care Physician and presents his ID card. 1. Gary goes to see an Out -of-Network Primary Care Physician and presents his ID card. | | 2. He receives treatment from the Primary Care Physician. The Plan's Eligible Expense for the In-Network office visit equals $125. 2. He recei ves treatment from the Primary Care Physician. The Eligible Expense for his visit is $175, however the Physician's fee is $225. | | 3. On his way out, Gary pays a $15 Copay. Since In -Network Physician office visits are covered at 100% after the Copay, G ary has met his financial obligations for this office visit. 3. The Physician's office requests no payment, informing Gary that it will bill UnitedHealthcare directly.* | | 4. The Plan pays $110 ($125 Eligible Expense minus $15 Copay). 4. Gary is resp onsible for paying the Eligible Expense of $175 directly to the Physician, because he has not yet met his Annual Deductible. | 5. Gary receives a bill from the Physician, and pays the Physician directly. | 6. The Physician's office, at its dis cretion, might bill Gary for the remaining $50: $225 - $175 = $50 (Physician's fee) (Eligible Expense) Gary's $50 payment does not apply to his Annual Deductible or Out -of-Pocket Maximum. | STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 15 SECTION 3 - HOW THE PLAN WORKS In-Network Benefits Out-of-Network Benefits 7. UnitedHealthcare applies the $175 toward Gary's Annual Deductible and Out -of- Pocket Maximum. *Although Out -of-Network providers have the right to request payment in full at the time of service, they bill UnitedHealthcare directly in most cases but there could be instances where you must file your own claim.STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 16 SECTION 4 - CARE COORDINATION AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SECTION 4 - CARE COORDINATION AND PRIOR AUTHORIZAT ION What this section includes: An overview of the Care Coordination program; and Covered Health Services which Require Prior Authorization. Care Management When you seek prior authorization as required, the Claims Administrator will work with you to implement the care management process and to provide you with information about additional services that are available to you, such as disease management programs, health education, and patient advocacy. UnitedHealthcare provides a program called Care Coordination designed to encourage personalized, efficient care for you and your covered Dependents . Care Coordination Nurses center their efforts on prevention, education, and closing any gaps in your care. The goal of the program is to ensure you receive the m ost appropriate and cost-effective services available. If you are living with a chronic condition or dealing with complex health care needs, UnitedHealthcare may assign to you a primary nurse, referred to as a Care Coordination Nurse to guide you through y our treatment. This assigned nurse will answer questions, explain options, identify your needs, and may refer you to specialized care programs. The Care Coordination Nurse will provide you with their telephone number so you can call them with questions about your conditions, or your overall health and well -being. Care Coordination Nurses will provide a variety of different services to help you and your covered family members receive appropriate medical care. Program components are subject to change without notice. As of the publication of this EOC , the Care Coordination SM program includes: Admission counseling - Nurse Advocates are available to help you prepare for a successful surgical admission and recovery. Call the number on the back of your ID card for support. Inpatient care management - If you are hospitalized, a Care CoordinationSM nurse will work with your Physician to make sure you are getting the care you need and that your Physician's treatment plan is being carried out effectively. Readmission Management - This program serves as a bridge between the Hospital and your home if you are at high risk of being readmitted. After leaving the Hospital, if you have a certain chronic or complex condition, you may receive a phone call from a Care Coordina tion SM nurse to confirm that medications, needed equipment, or follow -up services are in place. The nurse will also share important health care information, reiterate and reinforce discharge instructions, and support a safe transition home. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 17 SECTION 4 - CARE COORDINATION AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION Risk Management - Designed for participants with certain chronic or complex conditions, this program addresses such health care needs as access to medical specialists, medication information, and coordination of equipment and supplies. Participants may receive a phone call from a Care CoordinationSM nurse to discuss and share important health care information related to the participant's specific chronic or complex condition. If you do not receive a call from a Care Coordination SM nurse but feel you could benefit from any of these programs, please call the number on your ID card. Prior Authorization UnitedHealthcare requires prior authorization for certain Covered Health Services. In general, Physicians and other health care professionals who participate in a Network are responsible for obtaining prior authorization. However, if you choose to receive Covered Health Services from a n Out -of-Network provider, you are responsible for obtaining prior authorization before you receive the services. There are some In -Network Benef its, however, for which you are responsible for obtaining authorization before you receive the services. Services for which prior authorization is required are identified below and in Section 6, Additional Coverage Details within each Covered Health Serv ice category. It is recommended that you confirm with the Claims Administrator that all Covered Health Services listed below have been prior authorized as required. Before receiving these services from a n In-Network provider, you may want to contact the C laims Administrator to verify that the Hospital, Physician and other providers are In -Network providers and that they have obtained the required prior authorization. In -Network facilities and In -Network providers cannot bill you for services they fail to prior authorize as required. You can contact the Claims Administrator by calling the toll -free telephone number on the back of your ID card. When you choose to receive certain Covered Health Services from Out -of-Network providers, you are responsible for obtaining prior authorization before you receive these services. Note that your obligation to obtain prior authorization is also applicable when an Out-of-Network provider intends to admit you to an In-Network facility or refers you to other In -Network provi ders. To obtain prior authorization, call the toll -free telephone number on the back of your ID card . This call starts the utilization review process. Once you have obtained the authorization, please review it carefully so that you understand what services have been authorized and what providers are authorized to deliver the services that are subject to the authorization. The utilization review process is a set of formal techniques designed to monitor the use of, or evaluate the clinical necessity, appropri ateness, efficacy, or efficiency of, health care services, procedures or settings. Such techniques may include ambulatory review, prospective review, second opinion, certification, concurrent review, case management, discharge planning, retrospective revie w or similar programs. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 18 SECTION 4 - CARE COORDINATION AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION Covered Health Services which Require Prior Authorization In-Network providers are generally responsible for obtaining prior authorization from the Claims Administrator or contacting Care Coordination before they provide certain services to you. However, there are some services that you are responsible for obtaining prior authorization from the Claims Administrator. In many cases, your Out -of-Network Benefits will be reduced if the Claims Administrator has not provided prior authorization. See Section 6, Additional Coverage Details for additional information on your requirements for prior authorization with each C overed Health Service. The services that require you to obtain prior authorization from the Claims Administra tor are: Ambulance - non- emergent Out -of-Network .

Contacting the Claims Administrator or Care Coordination is easy. Simply call the toll- free number on your ID card. If you request a coverage determinati on at the time prior authorization is provided, the determination will be made based on the services you report you will be receiving. If the reported services differ from those actually received, the Claims Administrator's final coverage determination wil l be modified to account for those differences, and the Plan will only pay Benefits based on the services actually delivered to you. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 20 SECTION 4 - CARE COORDINATION AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION If you choose to receive a service that has been determined not to be a Medically Necessary Covered Health Service, you will be responsible for paying all charges and no Benefits will be paid. Special Note Regarding Medicare If you are enrolled in Medicare on a primary basis and Medicare pays benefits before the Plan, you are not required to receive prior authorization from the Claims Administrator before receiving Covered Health Services. Since Medicare pays benefits first, the Plan will pay Benefits second as described in Section 10, Coordination of Benefits (COB ). When Medicare is primary due to age or disability , the fo llowing are waived: Copayments; and Care Coordination prior authorization requirements.

STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 113 SECTION 9 - CLAIMS PROCEDURES SECTION 9 - CLAIMS PROCEDURES What this secti on includes: How In -Network and Out -of-Network claims work; and What to do if your claim is denied, in whole or in part. In-Network Benefits In general, if you receive Covered Health Services from an In -Network provider, UnitedHealthcare will pay the Phys ician or facility directly. If an In -Network provider bills you for any Covered Health Service other than your Copay or Coinsurance, please contact the provider or call UnitedHealthcare at the phone number on your ID card for assistance. Keep in mind, you are responsible for paying any Copay or Coinsurance owed to a n In- Network provider at the time of service, or when you receive a bill from the provider. Out-of-Network Benefits If you receive a bill for Covered Health Services from an Out -of-Network provider , you (or the provider if they prefer) must send the bill to UnitedHealthcare for processing. To make sure the claim is processed promptly and accurately, a completed claim form must be attached and mailed to UnitedHealthcare at the address on the back of your ID card. If Your Provider Does Not File Your Claim You can obtain a claim form by visiting www.uhcmaryland.com , calling the toll- free number on your ID card or contacting your Agency Benefit Coordinator or the Employee Benefits Divisio n. If you do not have a claim form, simply attach a brief letter of explanation to the bill, and verify that the bill contains the information listed below. If any of these items are missing from the bill, you can include them in your letter: your name a nd address; the patient's name, age and relationship to the Employee; the number as shown on your ID card; the name, address and tax identification number of the provider of the service(s); a diagnosis from the Physician; the date of service; and an itemiz ed bill from the provider that includes: - the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes; - a description of, and the charge for, each service; - the date the Sickness or Injury began; and STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 114 SECTION 9 - CLAIMS PROCEDURES - a statement indicating either that you are, or you are not, enrolled for coverage under any other health insurance plan or program. If you are enrolled for other coverage you must include the name and address of the other carrier(s). Failure to provide all the information listed above may delay any reimbursement that may be due you. For medical claims, the above information should be filed with UnitedHealthcare at the address on your ID card. After UnitedHealthcare has processed your claim, you will receive payment for Benefits that the Plan allows. It is your responsibility to pay t he Out -of-Network provider the charges you incurred, including any difference between what you were billed and what the Plan paid. Payment of Benefits You may not assign your Benefits under the Plan or any cause of action related to your Benefits under the Plan to a n Out -of-Network provider without UnitedHealthcare's consent. When you assign your Benefits under the Plan to a n Out -of-Network provider with UnitedHealthcare's consent, and the Out -of-Network provider submits a claim for payment, you and the Out -of-Network provider represent and warrant that the Covered Health Services were actually provided and were medically appropriate. When UnitedHealthcare has not consented to an assignment, UnitedHealthcare will send the reimbursement directly to you (the E mployee) for you to reimburse the Out -of-Network provider upon receipt of their bill. However, UnitedHealthcare reserves the right, in its discretion, to pay the Out -of-Network provider directly for services rendered to you. When exercising its discretion with respect to payment, UnitedHealthcare may consider whether you have requested that payment of your Benefits be made directly to the Out -of-Network provider. Under no circumstances will UnitedHealthcare pay Benefits to anyone other than you or, in its discretion, your provider. Direct payment to a n Out -of-Network provider shall not be deemed to constitute consent by UnitedHealthcare to an assignment or to waive the consent requirement. When UnitedHealthcare in its discretion directs payment to a n Out -of- Network provider, you remain the sole beneficiary of the payment, and the Out-of-Network provider does not thereby become a beneficiary. Accordingly, legally required notices concerning your Benefits will be directed to you, although UnitedHealthcare may i n its discretion send information concerning the Benefits to the Out -of-Network provider as well. If payment to a n Out -of-Network provider is made, the Plan reserves the right to offset Benefits to be paid to the provider by any amounts that the provider owes the Plan (including amounts owed as a result of the assignment of other plans' overpayment recovery rights to the Plan), pursuant to Refund of Overpayments in Section 10, Coordination of Benefits . Form of Payment of Benefits Payment of Benefits under t he Plan shall be in cash or cash equivalents, or in the form of other consideration that UnitedHealthcare in its discretion determines to be adequate. Where Benefits are payable directly to a provider, such adequate consideration includes the forgiveness i n whole or in part of amounts the provider owes to other plans for which UnitedHealthcare makes payments, where the Plan has taken an assignment of the other plans' recovery rights for value. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 115 SECTION 9 - CLAIMS PROCEDURES Health Statements Each month in which UnitedHealthcare processes at least one claim for you or a covered Dependent, you will receive a Health Statement in the mail. Health Statements make it easy for you to manage your family's medical costs by providing claims information in easy -to- understand terms. If you would rather track claims for yourself and your covered Dependents online, you may do so at www.uhcmaryland.com . You may also elect to discontinue receipt of paper Health Statements by making the appropriate selection on this site. Explanation of Benefits (EOB) You may request that UnitedHealthcare send you a paper copy of an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) after processing the claim. The EOB will let you know if there is any portion of the claim you need to pay. If any claims are denied in whole or in part, the EO B will include the reason for the denial or partial payment. If you would like paper copies of the EOBs, you may call the toll -free number on your ID card to request them. You can also view and print all of your EOBs online at www.uhcmaryland.com . See Section 14, Glossary for the definition of Explanation of Benefits. Important - Timely Filing of Out -of-Network Claims All claim f orms for Out -of-Network services must be submitted within 12 months after the date of service. Otherwise, the Plan will not pay any Benefits for that Eligible Expense, or Benefits will be reduced, as determined by UnitedHealthcare . This 12 -month requiremen t does not apply if you are legally incapacitated. If your claim relates to an Inpatient Stay, the date of service is the date your Inpatient Stay ends.

STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 120 SECTION 10 - COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) SECTION 10 - COORDINATION OF BENE FITS (COB) What this section includes: How your Benefits under this Plan coordinate with other medical plans; How coverage is affected if you become eligible for Medicare; and Procedures in the event the Plan overpays Benefits. Coordination of Benefits (COB) applies to you if you are covered by more than one health benefits plan, including any one of the following: another employer sponsored health benefits plan; a medical component of a group long -term care plan, such as skilled nursing care; no-fault or traditional \"fault\" type medical payment benefits or personal injury protect ion benefits under an auto insurance policy; medical payment benefits under any premises liability or other types of liability coverage; or Medicare or other governmental health benefit. If coverage is provided under two or more plans, COB determines which plan is primary and which plan is secondary. The plan considered primary pays its benefits first, without regard to the possibility that another plan may cover some expenses. Any remaining expenses may be paid under the other plan, which is considered sec ondary. The secondary plan may determine its benefits based on the benefits paid by the primary plan. How much this Plan will reimburse you, if anything, will also depend in part on the allowable expense. The term, \"allowable expense,\" is further explaine d below. Don't forget to update your Dependents' Medical Coverage Information Avoid delays on your Dependent claims by updating your Dependent's medical coverage information. Just log on to www.uhcmaryland.com or call the toll -free number on your ID card to update your COB information. You will need the name of your Dependent's other medical coverage, along with the policy number. Determining Which Plan is Primary Order of Benefit Determination Rules If you are covered by two or more plans, the benefit payment follows the rules below in this order: this Plan will always be secondary to medical payment coverage or personal injury protection coverage under any auto liability or no- fault insurance policy; when you have coverage under two or more medical plans and only one has COB provisions, the plan without COB provisions will pay benefits first; STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 121 SECTION 10 - COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) a plan that covers a person as an E mployee pays benefits before a plan that covers the person as a D ependent; if you are receiving COBRA continuation coverage under another employer plan, this Plan will pay Benefits first; your D ependent children will receive primary coverage from the parent whose birth date occurs first in a calendar year. If both parents have the s ame birth date, the plan that pays benefits first is the one that has been in effect the longest. This birthday rule applies only if: - the parents are married or living together whether or not they have ever been married and not legally separated; or - a cour t decree awards joint custody without specifying that one party has the responsibility to provide health care coverage; if two or more plans cover a D ependent child of divorced or separated parents and if there is no court decree stating that one parent i s responsible for health care, the child will be covered under the plan of: - the parent with custody of the child; then - the Spouse of the parent with custody of the child; then - the parent not having custody of the child; then - the Spouse of the parent not ha ving custody of the child; plans for active E mployees pay before plans covering laid -off or retired E mployees; the plan that has covered the individual claimant the longest will pay first; only expenses normally paid by the Plan will be paid under COB; and finally, if none of the above rules determines which plan is primary or secondary, the allowed benefits shall be shared equally between the plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, this Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the primary Plan. The following examples illustrate how the Plan determines which plan pays first and which plan pays second. Determining Primary and Secondary Plan - Examples 1) Let's say you and your Spouse both have family medical coverage through your respective employers. You are unwell and go to see a Physician. Since you're covered as an Employee under this Plan, and as a Dependent under your Spouse's plan, this Plan will pay Benefits for the Physician's office visit first. 2) Again, let's say you and your Spouse both have family medical coverage through your respective employers. You take your Dependent child to see a Physician. This Plan will look at your birthday and your Spouse's birthday to determine which plan pays first. If you were born on June 11 and your Spouse was born on May 30, your Spouse's plan will pay first. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 122 SECTION 10 - COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) When This Plan is Secondary to any Plan other than Medicare When this Plan is secondary to any plan other than Medicare , it determines the amount it will pay for a Covered Health Service by following the steps below. the Plan determines the amount it would have paid based on its contract; or if this Plan would have paid more than the primary plan paid, the Plan will pay t he difference less any applicable Deductible, Coinsurance and Copay requirements of the Plan. You will be responsible for any Coinsurance or Deductible and/or Copay payments as part of the COB payment. When This Plan is Secondary to Medicare When this Pla n is secondary to Medicare, it determines the amount it will pay for a Covered Health Service by following the steps below. when Benefit for covered services are paid by Medicare primary, UnitedHealthcare will not duplicate those payments; and if this Plan would have paid more than the primary plan paid, the Plan will pay the difference less any applicable Deductible and Coinsurance requirements of the Plan. You will be responsible for any Coinsurance or Deductible payments as part of the COB payment. Copa ys will be waived. Determining the Allow ed Benefit If This Plan is Secondary What is an allowed benefit? For purposes of COB, an allowed benefit is a health care expense that meets the definition of a Covered Health Service under this Plan. When the provider is a n In-Network provider for both the primary plan and this Plan, the allowed benefit is the primary plan's In -Network rate. When the provider is an In -Network provider for the primary plan and a n Out -of-Network provider for this Plan, the allowed benefit is the primary plan's In -Network rate. When the provider is a n Out -of-Network provider for the primary plan and a n In-Network provider for this Plan, the allowed benefit is the reasonable and customary charges allowed by the primary plan. When the prov ider is an Out -of-Network provider for both the primary plan and this Plan, the allowed benefit is the greater of the two Plans' reasonable and customary charges. If this plan is secondary to Medicare, please also refer to the discussion in the section bel ow, titled Determining the Allowable Expense When This Plan is Secondary to Medicare . STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 123 SECTION 10 - COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) When a Covered Person Qualifies for Medicare Determining Which Plan is Primary As permitted by law, this Plan will pay Benefits second to Medicare when you become eligible for Medicare, even if you don't elect it. There are, however, Medicare -eligible individuals for whom the Plan pays Benefits first and Medicare pays benefits second: Employees with active current employment status age 65 or older and their Spouses age 65 or older; and individuals with end- stage renal disease, for a limited period of time. Determining the Allowed Benefit When This Plan is Secondary to Medicare If this Plan is secondary to Medicare, the Medicare approved amount is the allowed benefit , as lon g as the provider accepts reimbursement directly from Medicare. If the provider accepts reimbursement directly from Medicare, the Medicare approved amount is the charge that Medicare has determined that it will recognize and which it reports on an \"explanation of Medicare benefits\" issued by Medicare (the \"EOMB\") for a given service. Medicare typically reimburses such providers a percentage of its approved charge - often 80%. If the provider does not accept assignment of your Medicare benefits, the Medicare limiting charge (the most a provider can charge you if they don't accept Medicare - typically 115% of the Medicare approved amount) will be the allowable expense. Medicare payments, combined with Plan Benefits, will not exceed 100% of the allowable expens e. If you are eligible for, but not enrolled in, Medicare, and this Plan is secondary to Medicare, Benefits payable under this Plan will be reduced by the amount that would have been paid if you had been enrolled in Medicare. When Medicare is primary due t o age or disability , the following are waived: Copayments ; and Care Coordination prior authorization requirements. If This Plan is Secondary to Medicare If this Plan is secondary to Medicare, it determines the amount it will pay for a Covered Health Servic e by following the steps below. The Plan determines the amount it would have paid based on its contract. If this Plan would have paid more than the primary plan paid, the Plan will pay the difference less any applicable Deductible and Coinsurance and Copay requirements of the Plan. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 124 SECTION 10 - COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) Medicare Crosso ver Program The Plan offers a Medicare Cross -over program for Medicare Part A and Part B and Durable Medical Equipment (DME) claims. Under this program, you no longer have to file a separate claim with the Plan to receive secondary benefits for these expenses. Your Dependent will also have this automated crossover, as long as he or she is eligible for Medicare and this Plan is your only secondary medical coverage. Once the Medicare Part A and Part B and DME carriers have reimbursed your health care provider, the Medicare carrier will electronically submit the necessary information to the Claims Administrator to process the balance of your claim under the provisions of this Plan. You can verify that the automated cros s-over took place when your copy of the explanation of Medicare benefits (EOMB) states your claim has been forwarded to your secondary carrier. This cross- over process does not apply to expenses that Medicare does not cover. You must go on to file claims for these expenses. For information about enrollment or if you have questions about the program, call the telephone number listed on the back of your ID card. Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under this Plan and other plans. The Plan Administrator may get the facts needed from, or give them to, other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under this Plan and other plans covering the person claiming benefits. The Plan Administrator does not need to tell , or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under this Plan must give UnitedHealthcare any facts needed to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. If you do not provide UnitedHealthcare the information needed to apply these rules and determine the Benefits payable, your claim for Benefits will be denied. Overpayment and Underpayment of Benefits If you are covered under more than one medical plan, there is a possibility that the other plan will pay a benefit that t he Plan should have paid. If this occurs, the Plan may pay the other plan the amount owed. If the Plan pays you more than it owes under this COB provision, you should pay the excess back promptly. Otherwise, the Group may recover the amount in the form of salary, wages, or benefits payable under any Group- sponsored benefit plans, including this Plan. The Group also reserves the right to recover any overpayment by legal action or offset payments on future Eligible Expenses. If the Plan overpays a health care provider, UnitedHealthcare reserves the right to recover the excess amount, from the provider pursuant to Refund of Overpayments , below . STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 125 SECTION 10 - COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) Refund of Overpayments If the Plan pays for Benefits for expenses incurred on account of a Covered Person, that Covere d Person, or any other person or organization that was paid, must make a refund to the Plan if: the Plan's obligation to pay Benefits was contingent on the expenses incurred being legally owed and paid by the Covered Person, but all or some of the expenses were not paid by the Covered Person or did not legally have to be paid by the Covered Person; all or some of the payment the Plan made exceeded the Benefits under the Plan; or all or some of the payment was made in error. The amount that must be refunded equals the amount the Plan paid in excess of the amount that should have paid under the Plan. If the refund is due from another person or organization, the Covered Person agrees to help the Plan get the refund when requested. If the refund is due from the Covered Person and the Covered Person does not promptly refund the full amount owed, the Plan may recover the overpayment by reallocating the overpaid amount to pay, in whole or in part, future Benefits for the Covered Person that are payable under the Plan. If the refund is due from a person or organization other than the Covered Person, the Plan may recover the overpayment by reallocating the overpaid amount to pay, in whole or in part, (i) future Benefits that are payable in connection with services provided to other Covered Persons under the Plan; or (ii) future benefits that are payable in connection with services provided to persons under other plans for which UnitedHealthcare makes payments, pursuant to a transaction in which the Plan's overpayment re covery rights are assigned to such other plans in exchange for such plans' remittance of the amount of the reallocated payment. The reallocated payment amount will equal the amount of the required refund or, if less than the full amount of the required ref und, will be deducted from the amount of refund owed to the Plan. The Plan may have other rights in addition to the right to reallocate overpaid amounts and other enumerated rights, including the right to commence a legal action . STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 126 SECTION 11 - SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT SECTION 11 - SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT The Plan has a right to subrogation and reimbursement. References to \"you\" or \"your\" in this Subrogation and Reimbursement section shall include you, your estate and your heirs and beneficiaries unless otherwise stated. Subrogation applie s when the plan has paid Benefits on your behalf for a Sickness or Injury for which any third party is allegedly responsible. The right to subrogation means that the Plan is substituted to and shall succeed to any and all legal claims that you may be entit led to pursue against any third party for the Benefits that the Plan has paid that are related to the Sickness or Injury for which any third party is considered responsible. Subrogation - Example Suppose you are injured in a car accident that is not your f ault, and you receive Benefits under the Plan to treat your injuries. Under subrogation, the Plan has the right to take legal action in your name against the driver who caused the accident and that driver's insurance carrier to recover the cost of those Be nefits. The right to reimbursement means that if it is alleged that any third party caused or is responsible for a Sickness or Injury for which you receive a settlement, judgment, or other recovery from any third party, you must use those proceeds to fully return to the Plan 100% of any Benefits you receive for that Sickness or Injury. The right of reimbursement shall apply to any Benefits received at any time until the rights are extinguished, resolved or waived in writing. Reimbursement - Example Suppose you are injured in a boating accident that is not your fault, and you receive Benefits under the Plan as a result of your injuries. In addition, you receive a settlement in a court proceeding from the individual who caused the accident. You must use the settlement funds to return to the plan 100% of any Benefits you received to treat your injuries. The following persons and entities are considered third parties: A person or entity alleged to have caused you to suffer a Sickness, Injury or damages, or who i s legally responsible for the Sickness, Injury or damages. Any insurer or other indemnifier of any person or entity alleged to have caused or who caused the Sickness, Injury or damages. The Plan Sponsor in a workers' compensation case or other matter alleg ing liability. Any person or entity who is or may be obligated to provide Benefits or payments to you, including Benefits or payments for underinsured or uninsured motorist protection, no-fault or traditional auto insurance, medical payment coverage (auto, homeowners or otherwise), workers' compensation coverage, other insurance carriers or third party administrators. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 127 SECTION 11 - SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT Any person or entity against whom you may have any claim for professional and/or legal malpractice arising out of or connected to a Sickness or Injury you allege or could have alleged were the responsibility of any third party. Any person or entity that is liable for payment to you on any equitable or legal liability theory. You agree as follows: You will cooperate with the Plan in protecting i ts legal and equitable rights to subrogation and reimbursement in a timely manner, including, but not limited to: - Notifying the Plan, in writing, of any potential legal claim(s) you may have against any third party for acts which caused Benefits to be paid or become payable. - Providing any relevant information requested by the Plan. - Signing and/or delivering such documents as the Plan or its agents reasonably request to secure the subrogation and reimbursement claim. - Responding to requests for information about any accident or injuries. - Making court appearances. - Obtaining the Plan's consent or its agents' consent before releasing any party from liability or payment of medical expenses. - Complying with the terms of this section. Your failure to cooperate with t he Plan is considered a breach of contract. As such, the Plan has the right to terminate your Benefits, deny future Benefits, take legal action against you, and/or set off from any future Benefits the value of Benefits the Plan has paid relating to any Sic kness or Injury alleged to have been caused or caused by any third party to the extent not recovered by the Plan due to you or your representative not cooperating with the Plan. If the Plan incurs attorneys' fees and costs in order to collect third party s ettlement funds held by you or your representative, the Plan has the right to recover those fees and costs from you. You will also be required to pay interest on any amounts you hold which should have been returned to the Plan. The Plan has a first priori ty right to receive payment on any claim against any third party before you receive payment from that third party. Further, the Plan's first priority right to payment is superior to any and all claims, debts or liens asserted by any medical providers, inc luding but not limited to hospitals or emergency treatment facilities, that assert a right to payment from funds payable from or recovered from an allegedly responsible third party and/or insurance carrier. The Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights apply to full and partial settlements, judgments, or other recoveries paid or payable to you or your representative, your estate, your heirs and beneficiaries, no matter how those proceeds are captioned or characterized. Payments include, but are not limi ted to, economic, non- economic, pecuniary, consortium and punitive damages. The Plan is not required to help you to pursue your claim for damages or personal injuries and no amount of associated costs, including attorneys' fees, shall be deducted from the Plan's recovery without the Plan's express written consent. No so- called \"Fund Doctrine\" or \"Common Fund Doctrine\" or \"Attorney's Fund Doctrine\" shall defeat this right. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 128 SECTION 11 - SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT Regardless of whether you have been fully compensated or made whole, the Plan may collect from you the proceeds of any full or partial recovery that you or your legal representative obtain, whether in the form of a settlement (either before or after any determination of liability) or judgment, no matter how those proceeds are captioned or characterized. Proceeds from which the Plan may collect include, but are not limited to, economic, non- economic, and punitive damages. No \"collateral source\" rule, any \"Made - Whole Doctrine\" or \"Make -Whole Doctrine,\" claim of unjust enrichment, nor any othe r equitable limitation shall limit the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights. Benefits paid by the Plan may also be considered to be Benefits advanced. If you receive any payment from any party as a result of Sickness or Injury, and the Plan alleges some or all of those funds are due and owed to the Plan, you and/or your representative shall hold those funds in trust, either in a separate bank account in your name or in your representative's trust account. By participating in and accepting Benefits f rom the Plan, you agree that (i) any amounts recovered by you from any third party shall constitute Plan assets to the extent of the amount of Plan Benefits provided on behalf of the Covered Person, (ii) you and your representative shall be fiduciaries of the Plan (within the meaning of ERISA) with respect to such amounts, and (iii) you shall be liable for and agree to pay any costs and fees (including reasonable attorney fees) incurred by the Plan to enforce its reimbursement rights. The Plan's rights to r ecovery will not be reduced due to your own negligence. By participating in and accepting Benefits from the Plan, you agree to assign to the Plan any Benefits, claims or rights of recovery you have under any automobile policy - including no- fault Benefits, PIP Benefits and/or medical payment Benefits - other coverage or against any third party, to the full extent of the Benefits the Plan has paid for the Sickness or Injury. By agreeing to provide this assignment in exchange for participating in and accepti ng Benefits, you acknowledge and recognize the Plan's right to assert, pursue and recover on any such claim, whether or not you choose to pursue the claim, and you agree to this assignment voluntarily. The Plan may, at its option, take necessary and approp riate action to preserve its rights under these provisions, including but not limited to, providing or exchanging medical payment information with an insurer, the insurer's legal representative or other third party; filing an ERISA reimbursement lawsuit to recover the full amount of medical Benefits you receive for the Sickness or Injury out of any settlement, judgment or other recovery from any third party considered responsible and filing suit in your name or your estate's name, which does not obligate th e Plan in any way to pay you part of any recovery the Plan might obtain. Any ERISA reimbursement lawsuit stemming from a refusal to refund Benefits as required under the terms of the Plan is governed by a six - year statute of limitations. You may not accept any settlement that does not fully reimburse the Plan, without its written approval. The Plan has the authority and discretion to resolve all disputes regarding the interpretation of the language stated herein. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 129 SECTION 11 - SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT In the case of your death, giving rise to any wrongful death or survival claim, the provisions of this section apply to your estate, the personal representative of your estate, and your heirs or beneficiaries. In the case of your death the Plan's right of reimbursement and right of subrogation shall apply if a claim can be brought on behalf of you or your estate that can include a claim for past medical expenses or damages. The obligation to reimburse the Plan is not extinguished by a release of claims or settlement agreement of any kind. No allocat ion of damages, settlement funds or any other recovery, by you, your estate, the personal representative of your estate, your heirs, your beneficiaries or any other person or party, shall be valid if it does not reimburse the Plan for 100% of its interest unless the Plan provides written consent to the allocation. The provisions of this section apply to the parents, guardian, or other representative of a Dependent child who incurs a Sickness or Injury caused by any third party. If a parent or guardian may b ring a claim for damages arising out of a minor's Sickness or Injury, the terms of this subrogation and reimbursement clause shall apply to that claim. If any third party causes or is alleged to have caused you to suffer a Sickness or Injury while you are covered under this Plan, the provisions of this section continue to apply, even after you are no longer covered. In the event that you do not abide by the terms of the Plan pertaining to reimbursement, the Plan may terminate Benefits to you, your dependent s or the [participant][employee], deny future Benefits, take legal action against you, and/or set off from any future Benefits the value of Benefits the Plan has paid relating to any Sickness or Injury alleged to have been caused or caused by any third par ty to the extent not recovered by the Plan due to your failure to abide by the terms of the Plan. If the Plan incurs attorneys' fees and costs in order to collect third party settlement funds held by you or your representative, the Plan has the right to re cover those fees and costs from you. You will also be required to pay interest on any amounts you hold which should have been returned to the Plan. The Plan and all Administrators administering the terms and conditions of the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights have such powers and duties as are necessary to discharge its duties and functions, including the exercise of its discretionary authority to (1) construe and enforce the terms of the Plan's subrogation and reimbursement rights and (2) make d eterminations with respect to the subrogation amounts and reimbursements owed to the Plan.

Your ent itlement to Benefits automatically ends on the date that coverage ends, even if you are hospitalized or are otherwise receiving medical treatment on that date. When your coverage ends, State of Maryland will still pay claims for Covered Health Services that you received before your coverage ended. However, once your coverage ends, Benefits are not provided for health services that you receive after coverage ended, even if the underlying medical condition occurred before your coverage ended. Your coverage un der the Plan will end on the earliest of: last day of the month your employment with the Group ends; the date the Plan ends; or the end of the pay period covered by your last deduction or payment.

The proof might include medical examinations at State of Maryland 's expense. However, you will not be asked for this information more than once a year. If you do not supply such proof within 60 days, the Plan will no longer pay Benefits for that child. Coverage will continue, as long as the enrolle d Dependent is incapacitated and dependent upon you, unless coverage is otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms of the Plan. Continuing Coverage Through COBRA If you lose your Plan coverage, you may have the right to extend it under the Consolida ted Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), as defined in Section 14, Glossary . Continuation coverage under COBRA is available only to Plans that are subject to the terms of COBRA. You can contact your Plan Administrator to determine if State of Maryland is subject to the provisions of COBRA. Continuation Coverage under Federal Law (COBRA) Much of the language in this section comes from the federal law that governs continuation coverage. You should call your Plan Administrator if you have questions about your right to continue coverage. In order to be eligible for continuation coverage under federal law, you must meet the definition of a \"Qualified Beneficiary\". A Qualified Beneficiary is any of the following persons who were covered under the Pla n on the day before a qualifying event: an Employee; an Employee's enrolled Dependent, including with respect to the Employee's children, a child born to or placed for adoption with the Employee during a period of continuation coverage under federal law; o r STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 133 SECTION 12 - WHEN COVERAGE ENDS an Employee's former Spouse. Qualifying Events for Continuation Coverage under COBRA The following table outlines situations in which you may elect to continue coverage under COBRA for yourself and your Dependents, and the maximum length of time you can receive continued coverage. These situations are considered qualifying events. If Coverage Ends Because of the Following Qualifying Events: You May Elect COBRA: For Yourself For Your Spouse For Your Child(ren) Your work hours are reduced 18 months 18 mo nths 18 months Your employment terminates for any reason (other than gross misconduct) 18 months 18 months 18 months You or your family member become eligible for Social Security disability benefits at any time within the first 60 days of losing coverage 1 29 months 29 months 29 months You die N/A 36 months 36 months You divorce (or legally separate) 2 N/A 36 months 36 months Your child is no longer an eligible family member (e.g., reaches the maximum age limit) N/A N/A 36 months You become entitled t o Medicare N/A See table below See table below 1Subject to the following conditions: (i) notice of the disability must be provided within the latest of 60 days after a). the determination of the disability, b). the date of the qualifying event, c). the da te the Qualified Beneficiary would lose coverage under the Plan, and in no event later than the end of the first 18 months; (ii) the Qualified Beneficiary must agree to pay any increase in the required premium for the additional 11 months over the original 18 months; and (iii) if the Qualified Beneficiary entitled to the 11 months of coverage has non -disabled family members who are also Qualified Beneficiaries, then those non -disabled Qualified Beneficiaries are also entitled to the additional 11 months of continuation coverage. Notice of any final determination that the Qualified Beneficiary is no longer disabled must be provided within 30 days of such determination. Thereafter, continuation coverage may be terminated on the first day of the month that begi ns more than 30 days after the date of that determination. 2A dependent spouse may also be eligible for COBRA if he or she is terminated from coverage by the employee spouse in anticipation of divorce or separation. If this occurs, the dependent spouse would be entitled to the same COBRA rights as a divorced spouse. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 134 SECTION 12 - WHEN COVERAGE ENDS How Your Medicare Eligibility Affects Dependent COBRA Coverage The table below outlines how your Dependents' COBRA coverage is impacted if you become entitled to Medicare. If Dependent Coverage Ends When: You May Elect COBRA Dependent Coverage For Up To: You become entitled to Medicare and don't experience any additional qualifying events 18 months You become entitled to Medicare, after which you experience a second qualifying event* before the initial 18- month period expires 36 months You experience a qualifying event*, after which you become entitled to Medicare before the initial 18 -month period expires; and, if absent this initial qualifying event, your Medicare entitlement would have resu lted in loss of Dependent coverage under the Plan 36 months * Your work hours are reduced or your employment is terminated for reasons other than gross misconduct. Getting Started You will be notified by mail if you become eligible for COBRA coverage as a result of a reduction in work hours or termination of employment. The notification will give you instructions for electing COBRA coverage, and advise you of the monthly cost. Your monthly cost is the full cost, including both Employee and Employer costs, plus a 2% administrative fee or other cost as permitted by law. You will have up to 60 days from the date you receive notification or 60 days from the date your coverage ends to elect COBRA coverage, whichever is later. You will then have an additional 45 days to pay the cost of your COBRA coverage, retroactive to the date your Plan coverage ended. During the 60 -day election period, the Plan will, only in response to a request from a provider, inform that provider of your right to elect COBRA coverage, ret roactive to the date your COBRA eligibility began. While you are a participant in the medical Plan under COBRA, you have the right to change your coverage election: during Open Enrollment; and following a change in family status, as described under Changin g Your Coverage in Section 2, Introduction . STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 135 SECTION 12 - WHEN COVERAGE ENDS Notification Requirements If your covered Dependents lose coverage due to divorce, legal separation, or loss of Dependent status, you or your Dependents must notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days of the la test of: the date of the divorce, legal separation or an enrolled Dependent's loss of eligibility as an enrolled Dependent; the date your enrolled Dependent would lose coverage under the Plan; or the date on which you or your enrolled Dependent are informe d of your obligation to provide notice and the procedures for providing such notice. You or your Dependents must also notify the Plan Administrator when a qualifying event occurs that will extend continuation coverage. If you or your Dependents fail to not ify the Plan Administrator of these events within the 60 day period, the Plan Administrator is not obligated to provide continued coverage to the affected Qualified Beneficiary. If you are continuing coverage under federal law, you must notify the Plan Adm inistrator within 60 days of the birth or adoption of a child. Once you have notified the Plan Administrator, you will then be notified by mail of your election rights under COBRA. Notification Requirements for Disability Determination If you extend your C OBRA coverage beyond 18 months because you are eligible for disability benefits from Social Security, you must provide your Agency Benefit Coordinator or the Employee Benefits Division with notice of the Social Security Administration's determination wit hin 60 days after you receive that determination, and before the end of your initial 18- month continuation period. The notice requirements will be satisfied by providing written notice to the Plan Administrator. The contents of the notice must be such that the Plan Administrator is able to determine the covered Employee and qualified beneficiary(ies), the qualifying event or disability, and the date on which the qualifying event occurred. Trade Act of 2002 The Trade Act of 2002 amended COBRA to provide for a special second 60 -day COBRA election period for certain Employees who have experienced a termination or reduction of hours and who lose group health plan coverage as a result. The special second COBRA election period is available only to a very limited g roup of individuals: generally, those who are receiving trade adjustment assistance (TAA) or 'alternative trade adjustment assistance' under a federal law called the Trade Act of 1974. These Employees are entitled to a second opportunity to elect COBRA cov erage for themselves and certain family members (if they did not already elect COBRA coverage), but only within a limited period of 60 days from the first day of the month when an individual begins receiving TAA (or would be eligible to receive TAA but for the requirement that unemployment benefits be exhausted) and only during the six months immediately after their group health plan coverage ended. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 136 SECTION 12 - WHEN COVERAGE ENDS If an Employee qualifies or may qualify for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974, he or she should contact the Plan Administrator for additional information. The Employee must contact the Plan Administrator promptly after qualifying for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974 or the Employee will lose his or her special COBRA rights. COBRA coverage elected durin g the special second election period is not retroactive to the date that Plan coverage was lost, but begins on the first day of the special second election period. When COBRA Ends COBRA coverage will end before the maximum continuation period, on the earli est of the following dates : the date, after electing continuation coverage, that coverage is first obtained under any other group health plan; the date, after electing continuation coverage, that you or your covered Dependent first becomes entitled to Medi care; the date coverage ends for failure to make the first required premium payment (premium is not paid within 45 days ); the date coverage ends for failure to make any other monthly premium payment (premium is not paid within 30 days of its due date ); the date the entire Plan ends; or the date coverage would otherwise terminate under the Plan as described in the beginning of this section. Note : If you selected continuation coverage under a prior plan which was then replaced by coverage under this Plan, con tinuation coverage will end as scheduled under the prior plan or in accordance with the terminating events listed in this section, whichever is earlier. Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act An Employee who is absent from employment for more than 30 days by reason of service in the Uniformed Services may elect to continue Plan coverage for the Employee and the Employee's Dependents in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended (USERR A). The terms \"Uniformed Services\" or \"Military Service\" mean the Armed Forces, the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard when engaged in active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full- time National Guard duty, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and any other category of persons designated by the President in time of war or national emergency. If qualified to continue coverage pursuant to the USERRA, Employees may elect to continue coverage under the Plan by notifying t he Plan Administrator in advance, and providing payment of any required contribution for the health coverage. This may include the amount the Plan Administrator normally pays on an Employee's behalf. If an Employee's Military Service is for a period of tim e less than 31 days, the Employee may not STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 137 SECTION 12 - WHEN COVERAGE ENDS be required to pay more than the regular contribution amount, if any, for continuation of health coverage. An Employee may continue Plan coverage under USERRA for up to the lesser of: the 24 month period beginning on the date of the Employee's absence from work; or the day after the date on which the Employee fails to apply for, or return to, a position of employment. Regardless of whether an Employee continues health coverage, if the Employee returns to a position of employment, the Employee's health coverage and that of the Employee's eligible Dependents will be reinstated under the Plan. No exclusions or waiting period may be imposed on an Employee or the Employee's eligible Dependents in connection with this reinstatement, unless a Sickness or Injury is determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to have been incurred in, or aggravated during, the performance of military service. You should call the Plan Administrator if you have questions about your rights to continue health coverage under USERRA. STATE OF MARYLAND MEDICAL CHOICE PLUS PLAN 138 SECTION 13 - OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION SECTION 13 - OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION What this section includes: Qualified Medical Child Support Orders (QMCSOs) ; Your relationship with UnitedHealthcare and State of Maryland ; Relationships with providers; Interpretation of Benefits; Information and records; Incentives to providers and you; The future of the Plan; and How to access the official Plan documents. Qualified Medical Child Support Orders (QMCSOs) A qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) is a j udgment, decree or order issued by a court or appropriate state agency that requires a child to be covered for medical benefits. Generally, a QMCSO is issued as part of a paternity, divorce, or other child support settlement. If the Plan receives a medical child support order for your child that instructs the Plan to cover the child, the Plan Administrator will review it to determine if it meets the requirements for a QMCSO. If it determines that it does, your child will be enrolled in the Plan as your Depe ndent, and the Plan will be required to pay Benefits as directed by the order. You may obtain, without charge, a copy of the procedures governing QMCSOs from the Plan Administrator. Note: A National Medical Support Notice will be recognized as a QMCSO if i t meets the requirements of a QMCSO.
