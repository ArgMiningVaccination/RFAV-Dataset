I--HC 29 E-campus to be sole source of schedule info Beginning Fall semester 2002, the university will use e-campus as the primary medium for distributing the semester schedule ol classes. Vice President for Academic Affairs Douglas Brown announced the change and explained the reason in an e-mail to the JMU community yesterday. \"Using e-campus as the sole source of course information acknowledges our student popula- tion's growing preference for infor- mation in electronic format and offers the academic community other advantages as well,\" Brown wrote. \"The electronic format will eliminate the lead time required to prepare a printed semester sched- ule booklet and allow academic units approximately four addition- al weeks for planning and revising their course offering files before students begin registration. As a result, departments will have more time to utilize course demand data before their tour*1 offerings arc made available, and students will be using a reliable, up-to-date source of course information as they prepare for registration. We will no longer have the discrepan- cies currently existing between the iirinted publication and the final 1st of course offerings. \"The Office ot the Registrar will display the schedule in a format similar to that presented in the class schedule publication as a link to its home page [wini'imu.eduJregiS' trar\\\" Brown wrote. \"The format led listings will support printing, so students who want to study a par- ticular department's course listings in printed form may still do so. The registrar's office will also publish a booklet ot registration policii-- and procedures 10 information usually appearing in the front portion ot the printed schedule of classes \u2014 such as deadlines and instructions \u2014 will be available. In addition, the registrar's office will work with individual departments on a limit- ed basis to produce printed depart- ment course offerings suitable for mailing to special need student populations.\" University Registrar Sherry Hood said she thinks the changes will ulti- mately make registration easier, espe- cially since most students exclusively use e-campus already. Hood said the system is reliable enough to use it without an addi- tional printed version. \"We've had a very smooth registration this spring,\" she said. \"Most of the issues we encountered at the early stages [of e-campus' existence] have been solved.\" The hours of availability for e- campus, currently 7 a.m. to mid- night daily, will remain the same, Hood said. Some students said they won't miss the booklet. \"If s just a wade of paper,\" sophomore Kelly Nguyen said. \"1 never pick one up.\" Others were not so quick to accept the change. \"Thaf s not nec- essarily the best idea,\" junior Sara Evans said. \"Sometimes the Internet shuts down and you have to sit around and wait for the schedules to be back online. Having a hard copy is handy.\" - compiled from staff reports riiitrtJmi, Jiiniuini / Dare to nullifi able to join handswith little \\M today.

Duncan, on Tuesday and that three other partners on the Enron account had been placed on administra- tive leave. In addition, four part- ners in Andersen's Houston office \"have been relieved of their management responsibili- ties,\" Andersen said. The revelations and the shakeup came as federal and congressional investigators broadened their probes into the Collapse of the giant energy trading company and of Andersen's role in Enron's financial dealings. Enron, once the seventh- largest company in the country with political connections all the way to the White House, declared bankruptcy last month, leaving more than 4,000 workers jobless, wiping out the retirement savings of thousands more and bringing about financial losses to tens of thousands of investors Andersen on Tuesday described a pell-mell rush to destroy records following an \"urgent meeting\" of Enron auditors on Oct. 23. Andersen said Duncan called that meeting shortly after learning that Securities and Exchange Commission inves- tigators had asked for Enron's financial accounting and reporting records. \"These activities were on such a scale and of such a nature as to remove any doubt that Andersen's policies and reasonable good judgment were violated,\" Andersen said If) .1 statement. The order to destroy docu- ments came less than two weeks after an Andersen lawyer detailed the firm's document-shredding policy to its auditors. October was a critical month for Enron. It was forced to disclose a $1.2 bil- lion charge against stock- holders' equity because com- pany debts had been con- cealed in a series of company- related partnerships. Days later, the SEC announced its investigation into those part- nership transactions and by month's end, Enron had \"locked down\" its 401(k) plan and prohibited employees from selling Enron shares out of their accounts. On Nov. 8, Andersen received a subpoena from the SEC seeking Enron documents, at which point Duncan's assis- tant e-mailed a plea to Mop the shredding.\" Andersen said it has been able to recover some documents from computerized backup files. -66 ...Andersen's policies and reasonable good judgement were violated. \u2014 Authur Andersen accounting firm 95 Duncan, who turned over auditing documents to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, was scheduled to meet with committee investiga tors Wednesday at his lawyer's office in Washington. \"Now that he's been fired, he should have more motiva- tion to fully cooperate with us,\" committee spokesman Ken Johnson said. HARRY HAMR1 RCVMn Ml Oaitv ,Vm President George W. Bush meets with his Tressury Secretary Paul O'Neill In the Oval Office Thursday, Jan. 10. Cabinet members deny helping Enron because of ties BY STEVEN THOMMA Knight-Ridder Newspapers Senior members of the Bush administration on Sunday said they did not intervene to help bankrupt energy giant Enron Corp. and did not alert President Bush or the public because the company's problems were public knowledge. In an effort to insulate the administration from a fast growing scandal. Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill tried to dispel suggestions that the administration might have tried to help the company because of its political connec- tions. Company executives con- tributed to Bush as well as to dozens of Republicans and Democrats in Congress. Evans and O'Neill also dis- missed suggestions that the administration could have done something to save the retirement funds of thousands of Enron employees. Rep Henry Waxman, has com- plained that the administia (ion should have acted to save the company and the employ- ees who had invested heavily in its stock. Evans said he received a call from Lay last Oct. 29 informing him of the company's problems with its credit ratings and seek- ing help. Hours later, Evans met with O'Neill for a regular lunch. \"He agreed with my judg- ement not to do anything,\" Evans said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"Companies come and go. It's... part of the genius of cap- it.ihsm,\" O'Neill said on ' I-ox News Sunday.\" Both cabinet officers por- trayed their talks with Lay as neither unusual nor surprising, given news reports that the Houston-based firm was ailing and its stock was sinking fast. \"At that point in time, tens of thousands of employees had stready lost their life savings because the stock value had already CoUapaed,\" Ivanssaid He added that Enron stock had lost 90 percent ol its value by the time Lav called him. \"I frankly think what Ken told me over the phone was not new news. You all had in-iii reporting foi weeks that Enron had problems, that the] were In trouble,\" O'Neill added during his Sunday appearance on \"Fox News.\" O'Neill said the calls from Enron chairman Lay were brief, did not seek any specific help and came at a time last fall when he was focused on seizing the financial assets of terrorists and working on a proposal to stimu- late the economy. -66- All this lies together. \u2014 John Dingcll House Energy ami Commerce Commillee 9? \"I didn't think this was wor- thy of me running across the street and telling the president,\" O'Neill said of a phone call from [.ay. \"I don't go across the abed and tell the president every time someone calls me \" Enron declared bankruptcy IXv. 2, and while top executives had been selling their st(*k tor months at higher plicae, thou- sands of employees watched helplessly as retirement accounts invested in company stock were wiped out.

Carl Levin, chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations, said he is focusing on \"decep- tive practices by Enron and Arthur Andersen that concealed hn.inci.il problems from investors and the public. Levin said he accepts the Bush admin Oration's word that it did noth- ing to help Enron. But Rep. John Dingell, the senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, urged a broader look at Enron's ties to the Bush administration, includ- ing its role in the formulation of Bush's proposed energv pod, v Said Dingell: \"All this ties together.\" American Taliban member charged Tuesday PouJfamly ph\u00bbk> John Walk., Undh at a*, 10 \u00ab n th.

I!u> fill said Walker told agents that he learned last June that Osama bin Laden had sent suicide bombers to the United States and that he met personal- ly with bin Laden. Walker, son of a former Justice Department attorney and the only American known to have fought for al-Qaida, bin Laden's terrorist network, faces a possible life sentence. (Walker) chose to fight with the laliban, to train with al-Qaida and to be led by Osama bin Laden,\" said Attorney General John AshcToft, who announced the charges at a press conference Tuesday \"We may never know why he turned his back on our country and our values, but we cannot ignore that he did \" Walker, 20, who has been in solitary confinement aboard the USS Bataan in the Arabian Sea, will be turned over to the FBI this week. He will be held in Alexandria and tried in the fed- eral courthouse there where another al-Qaida terrorism BUI pect, Zacarias Moussaoui, also faces trial. Walker faces one count of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, one count of pro- viding material support and resources to al-Qaida and another for supporting Taliban. A final count is for \"con- tributing goods and sen. ices to the Taliban.\" The first two charges are punishable by up to life in prison. The remaining two could each cam Walker another 10 years in prison.

Witnessing a Dream: A Night at TDU, will be in the Comer Pocket, Taylor Hall, from 8 to 10 p.m. During this social event, the stage is open for a poetry reading while giving students and staff a time to relax, congregate and share thoughts, according to Epps. Before the Formal Program on Monday, UREC will have an Open House from 2 to 4 p.m. to give students and opportunity to tour the facilities. \"Anyone is invited who has only seen bits and pieces of what UREC has to offer,\" said assistant director of UREC facil- ities Dave Frock. During the open house, UREC will offer group fitness demonstrations, fitness orienta- tions and nutritional analysis, tours, hiring booths, informa- tion tables on intramural, club and varsity sports, yoga demonstrations, university chef cooking demonstrations, pool golf and climbing wall oppor- tunities. \"We have a very strong diversity initiative here at UREC, and we are always look- ing for opportunities to send our message out there to any- one on campus,\" Frock said. \"D.irc to Dream!\" events were created and planned by a student-run CMISS committee. \"last year started the week- end-long range of activities, and students associated the tra- ditional programs as well as new ones to generate ideas and thoughts that were all their own,\" said Sophia Bryant, CMISS assistant director \"All the students who served as chair this year definitely need to be commended for all the work they've done.\" The events are expected to be well-attended as they have been in the past, Bryant said The MLK Formal Program is also a passport event. \"I think it is an important day to have off because he was in important person in shaping what our country has become,\" freshman Jessa Mickelson said. Sophomore Brian Nido said, \"I think that people should not look at MLK Day as a holiday. but more a a reflection and remembrance of what MLK did for our country. In addition, I think more people should take part in the numerous events that are being held.\" Harding said, \"CMISS does- n't want Monday to be seen as just another day off. We want it to be a day of celebration, to think of Martin Luther King's dream and to make dreams come true.\" Students teaching students in communities nationwide STUDENTS, from page 1 to help more than one million children in 16 urban and rural areas receive much-needed aca- demic assistance. Senior Megan Craig, who considered the Peace Corps and is applying to TFA, said the pro- gram appealed to her because of the opportunities and chal- lenges it offered. \"Not only would I be staying in the U.S., but I'd be doing something to better our country,\" she said. According to Hanousek- Monge, primarily corps mem- bers are able to make an impact in the lives of children, gain the insight and credibility to effect long-term change and prepare themselves for success in any professional field. Chris Fleisher, a 1999 [MU alumnus and TFA corps mem- ber, recently completed his teaching position in Houston, Texas. \"It was the most chal- lenging thing I've ever done in my entire life,\" he said. Corps members are placed in under-funded and under- resourced school systems in both rural and urban commu- nities across the nation. Children in the areas TFA tar- gets often face numerous socio-economic challenges, including minimal access to health care, a lack of nutrition and quality housing and limit- ed academic opportunities. As a reading and English teacher for sixth graders in a low-income community public school, Fleisher said he went through a \"cycle of emotions\" in adapting to his teaching environment and his students. \"1 learned a lot of things I'd for- gotten about growing up,\" he said. '1 had to go in and fail before I was going to succeed.\" Fleisher said he often ques- tioned the ethics of his role as a corps member. \"I was entering a community I wasn't from and that I thought I could change it ... an arrogant notion.\" However, he said he tried to enter his job with humility and respect and grew to see the ways in which he could help make a difference in the community. He initially became interest ed in social service through par- ticipating in JMU's Alternative Spring Break program and said after graduation he felt he was too young to settle on a career. \"I wanted to make a differ- ence,\" he said. \"And money was not a factor.\" Applicants who pass the ini- tial screening process are grant- ed day-long interviews, which include sample teaching lessons and group discussions. Those accepted into the program par- ticipate in a five-week summer institute to train and prepare for entering the classroom. Throughout the two years of service, TFA aims to provide corps members with ongoing support services through an extensive network of local and national resources. The pro- gram's 16 sites range from as close as Washington, D.C. to as distant as Los Angeles, Calif. Although corps members are not certified teachers, school districts hire them through alternate routes to teacher certi- fication in conjunction with TFA. As a result, corps mem- bers must often take education courses once they begin teach- ing to meet varying state requirements. \"It's very stressful but it's one of the most important things I've ever done,\" said 1997 JMU alumnus De'Shawn Wright, a recent TFA corps member. \"I've probably learned more from the kids than they learned from me,\" he said. After graduation, Wright worked in advertising- for a year before he decided to apply for TFA. He was placed in the Washington Heights school dis- trict of New York City and taught all subjects to sixth grade students. Wright said his biggest chal- lenge was building relation- ships with his students. \"You have to be a teacher, an admin- istrator, a father and a big brother because every kid has different needs,\" he said. Currently, Wright still works in the same school and plans to go into public administration with a focus on education and community development. Today Fleisher is the office manager for the TFA national office in New York City and works as an applicant selector. Sixty percent of TFA corps members continue to teach or work in education full time alter their two year assign- ments, according to the TFA Web site. \"TFA is looking for out- standing recent college gradu- ates who excel in many areas and are willing to make a com- mitment to teaching,\" Hanousek-Monge said. Although Hanousek-Monge described the application process as \"highly selective,\" she said TFA does not place a limit on the number of appli- cants it accepts Each year TFA offers two application deadlines and selects approximately 1,000 corps members. The first dead- line was Oct. 30, 2001 and the second is upcoming, Feb. 21. For more information about TFA or the application process, students can go to its Web site at www. trachforamerica.org/ifa. SCC strives to raise $102,002 for challenge SCC, from page 1 the same seal as the Oct. 12 letters, according to Davis. The gifts to the SCC not only are welcomed for their monetary value, but also for the enthusiasm they generate among the steering committee and team leaders, Davis Mid. \"It gets us excited about it,\" Davis said. \"Everyone wants to know who they [IN8]are.\" During the celebration Monday, Davis and Langlais announced that SCC raised nearly $9,000 in gilts and pledges from quiet fund raising last year. Most of this money is from campus lead- ers and members of SCC's steering committee, accord- ing to Davis. The bulk of the fund raising will be done during this semester, he said. Langlais and Davis described the reason seniors chose the Class of 2002's gift, a replica of the Tempietta, or temple, that stands at Montpelier. \"People want to be able to have a gift that they can look at,\" Davis said. The polled students indicated they wanted something they can return to campus later and see. \"A physical structure such as a monument works for that,\" Davis said. The Tempietta's connection to James Madison makes it a good choice, he said. Langlais said the Tempietta is the only struc- ture that was officially designed by Madison him- self. It was built on a dare, when someone challenged Madison to serve his wife, Dolley's ice cream on the Fourth of July. He designed and built the structure and packed ice beneath it so Dolley's ice cream could be served even in summer. JMU's Tempietta would also be a memorial in remembrance of the events of Sept. 11,2001. I .anglais said the SCC has set its goal this year for $102,002, and it hopes to have the structure built in front of Burruss Hall within the next three to five years. The SCC co-chairs and several administrators spoke during Monday's event and commissioned the small group of students in atten- dance to go out and ask their friends and acquaintances to pledge. \"Remember your univer- sity,\" said Jeff Gilligan, direc- tor of the Madison Fund. \"When we come back to the university, we want you to have your mark here.\" \u00aeTOYOTA Celica\u2014 The Inside Story On the outside, it's easy lo see that Celica is racetrack inspired.

JAN. 17. 2002 NEWS It'S NEWS THURSDAY. JAN. 17. 20021 THE BREEZE 17 Prince Harry faces claims of alleged drug use BY VINCRNT SCHODOLSKI CImago mount Police officials said Monday that Ihey would kx>k into Prince Harry's use of marijuana and could not rule out taking legal action against the 17-ye.w 3d heir to the British throne. Harry relumed to classes at exclusive Eton College on Monday after a meeting with his father and his father's friend. Camilla Parker Bowles, at Prince Charles' country house in Gloucestershire. At Eton. Harry is more sheltered from paparazzi. Buckingham Palace Issued a statement Monday, saying Queen Elizabeth supports the way Charles has handled her grand- son's use of drugs and alcohol. \"The queen shares the Prince of Wales's views on the serious- ness of Prince Harry's behavior and supports the action which has been taken,\" the statement said. \"She hopes the matter can now be considered as closed.\" Bui, at least as far as the police and Eton officials, it was not. \"We are not in DOIMMtan of any evidence that would liistify us interviewing him,\" said a police spokesman in Wiltshire, where the alleged use of marijuana took place. \"But (we| will of course con- sider and act, if appropriate, on any information provided.\" Wiltshire police superinten- dent Mandy Fvely added that Harry would be treated \"exactly the same way\" asanv other teen. l-egal penalties for first-time casual u^e of marijuana differ in Britain, but usually involve a warning and possibly some form of community mvioe it charges are pressed and proven. The queen sliares the Prince of Wales' views on the seriousness of Prince Harry's behavior... \u2014 Buckingham Palace press release 99 A spokesman for the Home Office said it was unlikely that police would bring charges against Harry since he had not been caught possessing, i >r using, marijuana. According to the British pa-ss, the prince smoked marijuana in .i shed behind the Kattlebone Inn, the pub where he reportedly did his drinking. According to Fton's head- master, then- are clear rules about drug abuse by Eton students. \"Any boy possessing, using or selling drugs at school during term can expect to forfeit his place,\" John Lewis said in a statement Monday \"In cases when* concerns exist about a boy's possible involvement in drugs, he will be counseled and warned, and urine tests are sometimes used to clarify the situation and if possible to put a boy in the clear, which is in fact the usual outcome.\" The pnnce, third in line to the throne, admitted to his father that he had smoked mar- ijuana and drank alcohol last summer when he was just 16. Both acts are illegal in England where the minimum legal age for drinking without adult supervision is 18. Responding to thecontev-u >n. Charles arranged for a family friend to accompany the young man on a visit to Featherstone Lodge, a drug rehabilitation facil- ity where Harry spoke with drug addicts and alcoholics who reportedly warned him about tiie ease with which one could slip from casual use to addiction. Questions also remained about the n>le played by body- guards who accompany Harry at all times. Some observers -pemlaled that the guards could have stopped, or facilitat- ed, the prince's actions. But palace officials said the guards generally try to remain unobtru- sive ind probably would not have accompanied him closely in the pub, or to the shed. London newspapers, espe- cially the tabloids, followed the story of the prince's troubles in grv.it detail Monday, including photo layouts of Harry with numerous girls, sometimes in various degrees of embrace. The coverage lead to a warn- ing by the Press Complaints Commission, the industry's self- regulatory body. The warning reminded newspaper editors about the strict privacy rules to which they had agreed regard- ing coverage of Harry and his older brother Prince William. Gunman targets two students BY MELANIR LERKOWITZ. BOBBY CUZA AND ROCCO PARASCANDOLA Newsaay Two students were shot inside Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan Tuesday, forcing officials to lock- down the building on the non- violent activist's birthday. Both victims, Andre Napper, 17, who was struck in the hip, and Andre Wilkins, who turned 17 yesterday and was hit in the back as he tried to flee, were in stable condition at St. Vincent's Medical Center and are expected to survive. Police said Tuesday that they believe the shooting was in retaliation for a fight last week. The gunman, whose connection to the school, if any, is unclear, got away Tuesday. He apparently left behind his weapon, a 380-caliber pistol, which was found on the fifth floor The school, which has metal detectors at the main entrance and some side doors, is protected by two police officers and 19 school safety agents. Police believe the gunman sneaked in through a side entrance to avoid the detectors. New York City Schools Chancellor Harold Levy acknowledged that safety has been a problem at the school and that the Board of Education will re-examine security procedures. Levy said the victims and the gunman had argued a week ago about a girl. Police, however, said they weren't sure if the fight was over a girl or something else. The violence erupted in a fourth-floor hallway as the two victims were changing classes. The school principal is on leave for National Cuard duty and could not be reached for comment. Bush possibly has swallowing disorder BY JODI ENDA Knight Riddcr Newspapers Independent experts said Monday that President Bush's fainting spell Sunday, which his White House doctor attributed to a pretzel that he had diffi- culty swallowing, might well be a swallowing disor- der that is uncommon but rarely life-threatening. William Ravich, clinical director ot the swallowing cen- ter U )ohns Hopkins University medical school in Baltimore, said that when swallowing leads to fainting, it often is the result of a drop in blood pres- sure caused by a disorder called vaso vagal syncope \"It's a common cause of fainting in an otherwise healthy individual,' R.ivich said, cau- tioning that nerve-mediated fall- en blood nrtMiint thai result! in a person no longer able to stand and losing conscious- ness.

Monday marks an impor- tant day in the JMU spring semester \u2014 the first semes- ter holiday. Not only is it the first semester holiday, though, but it is the second time JMU has had an entire day off of school for Martin Luther King Day. Students crusaded hard to get Martin Luther King Jr. Day off. Rallying behind the cause, students signed peti- tions, spoke to administra- tors ana even protested dur- ing JMU President Linwood Rose's inauguration on Sept. 17, 1999, a day that students had off of school. An article in the Sept. 13, 1999 issue of The Breeze said, \"In addition to the mixed thoughts and feel- ings over the inauguration event itself, several mem- bers of the JMU community said they think other holi- days, namely Martin Luther King Jr. Day war- rant the same kind of respect and observant.\" In Spring 2000, JMU can- celed afternoon classes on MLK Day, and more than 100 students gathered out- side of Zane Showker Hall to honor King and partici- pate in a Peace March that concluded at Grafton Stovall Theatre with between 350 and 400 people, according to the Jan. 20, 2000 issue of The Breeze. And now the univer- sity is regularly closed for the day. -44- \"...many will party hard on Sunday, sleep the day away on Monday and then scramble to do homework...\" The question remain-.. however: Will people take advantage of the day to remember King's message and the impact he had on the country? This is why classes have been canceled, haven't they? In January 1998, the Student Government Association sponsored a bill of opinion to make MLK Day an official university holiday and a day off from classes. Commuter Sen. Tim Emry said the bill wasn't an attempt to give students extra vacation. \"I want peo- ple to stay on campus to rec- ognize Martin Luther King as a community,\" he said. \"Each student needs to rec- pgnize the sacrifices Dr. Kulff made.\" Next week will be chock full of events to honor King, such as a presentation by former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder on Monday, a multicultural workshop on Wednesday and a march and speak out on Thursday. While there will be partic- ipants in the multitude of activities the university has planned in honor of the day, many will party hard on Sunday, sleep the day away on Monday and then scram- ble to do homework they should have done earlier in the weekend on Monday night. Not exactly reminis- cent of the power of King's dream. Speaking of toler- ance and equality. King cru- saded for a society where all races would come together with a sense of unity and humanity. We celebrate the day in hopes that this com- munity and all Americans will appreciate those efforts and acknowledge the effects in our small JMU world. JMU, and other universi- ties around the nation, should have off on this day. Hopefully, students, faculty and staff will appreciate the day for more than just a three-day weekend and will concentrate, at least for a lit- tle while, on why we have the day off. O I DAN MAURER L^^j CIRCUS AMERICANA Senior reflects on last real holiday with family 1 .ast month marked the sec- ond holiday season since the Towers fell and the Pentagon quaked. Just as we did on Turkey Day, Americans bore a great burden as we considered those things for which to be extraordinarily thankful. Our still wobbling economy, the bereaved families shattered by the Sept. 11 tragedy and our troops struggling, suffering and ultimately succeeding abroad were all weighty concerns we endured over our holiday break. But pessimism can never stand \u2014 and never has stood \u2014 straight against the overpower- ing winds of holiday commer- cialism. This year was no differ- ent as our attitudes were on the cusp of being \"merry and bright.\" For me, it was all these things and more, for it marked the last time I will be guaranteed a Christmas home with my fam- ily in the \"son-home-from-col- lege\" role. 1 will graduate this May, and, like many other sen- iors, 1 have resigned myself to the soft, chilling knowledge that come next year, 1 will have to make an attempt to be home for the holidays. So, like a great number of seniors intent on see- ing the world, this last holiday break was bittersweet \u2014 a relax- ing vacation away from the stresses of academia, while at the same time the last vacation as \"one of the kids.\" As such, I was very conscious of the little things, the quirks and abnor- malities that color Maurer family get-togethers, and made this Christmas so unde- niably memorable. That week before Christmas will forever be called the Holiday Pentathlon in our fami- ly lore. Five visits, four states, three kids, two days ... and a partridge in a pear tree. Stick five semi- and full-grown human beings into a minivan decked out with luggage and Presents and it won't matter ow closely related to one another you are. Suddenly the seats are too cramped, there isn't ever enough leg room, it's either too hot or too cold, the music is either crap or it's on too loud and every 10 minutes necessitates a potty-break or a \"how close are we?\" Imagine for a moment what a seven-seat Ford minivan, loaded with three adults and two teenage boys (all of which are sick to some degree) will smell like after five hours of slop-and-go road trav- el on Interstate 95. Those five visits, with an intermission stop-over/water break at the grandparents' house, were together an Olympic event in the sense of the grit, determination and mental fortitude it took to sur- vive that two-day excursion into New Jersey to see relatives and old friends. My parents, hopped up on the idea of joint \"those were the days\" trips down nos- talgia lane with their friends, were less concerned about pack- ing than they were about having the right gifts. About a third of the way \u2014 somewhere In Delaware \u2014 my dad concluded that he forgot to pack his black dress shoes and would therefore have to either wear my younger brother's pair (since he didn't want to dress up anyway) or stop again and buy new ones. Without a recent fix of caffeine, he was not altogether amicable to that particular idea. By the end of day one, after three visits, three sandwiches and as many \"pit-stops\" to accommodate a certain member of our clan, we were obviously out of our element and prone to fits of dementia. We eventually made our way to the sleeping bag-littered campground that would occupy my grandpar- ents' living room that night. Meanwhile, the Maurer Five was singing \"I Will Always Love You\" by Whitney Houston in five different keys. Weeks of unmitigated expo- sure to blinking lights will drive a person crazy or permit a per- son to notice the insanity of all those around him. The eccentric- ities of my family are legion, as I'm sure others can to attest to about their own families. There was my grandmother, serving nine of us a feast of sliced turkey, carrots, green beans and mashed potatoes, who would not \u2014 ever \u2014 sit down to feed herself. Not until she was fully satisfied that the eight of us had every helping of every food we wanted and were nearly finished with our meals, did she finally sit down with her own cold plate. No amount of pleading \u2014 or yelling \u2014 by my grandfather, aunt and parents could relieve her from this decades-old neurosis.

What I want to explore is what happens in the course of married life to lead so many couples to divorce. Do we, as a society, believe marriages can be only temporary, even after say- ing those symbolic words? (>r is it that our human nature can't predict how we will be in one, five, 21), 50 years down the road? Is there anyway to ensure that marriages are permanent and everlasting? I don't think so. Is there any way to limit the num- ber of COUplMj that consider divorcing? Doubtful Should we .is .1 Nouet\\ believe uUvOKfl is wrong? In the most ptrfa I Utopian world, yes. But in the practical world we live in, no. Or is it whether it's acceptable or tolerable? I'll lei you contem- plate that as you read. Forty percent to 45 percent of marriages initiated this year will end in dtVOftt bcfoft QM part- ner dies, according to Joshua Goldstein in his work, \"Tne lev- eling of divorce in the United States,\" a fact which is agreed upon by other leading sociolo- gists. This refutes the myth that half of all marriages end in divorce, even though it may have been that high several decades ago. I assume that people who marry for the first time may either be unsure of what love is or unsure they are able to tell if they can spend the rest of their life with one person. This is completely understandable. Life is trial and error and we can't learn from mistakes we don't make. So, would it be cor- rect to assume that second and subsequent marriages will be more successful? Those who have previously wed are now a little smarter, know a little more about themselves and have probably learned to pick up on small and insignificant signs as to whether a potential partner is in fact someone right for them. In that same Goldstein piece, he concludes that second and sub- sequent marriages are more likely to end in divorce. What are some ways to pos- sibly lower the chances of mar- riages ending in divorce? According to David Popenoe's \"The Top Ten Myths of Divorce,\" many couples will live together before marriage because \"it is a good way to reduce the chances of eventual- ly divorcing.\" In \"Premarital Cohabitation and Marital Instability in the United States: A Reassessment,\" Alfred Demaris and K. Vaninadha Rao conclude that these types of relationships are more likely to end in divorce because evi- dence supports that \"cohabita- tion itself generates attitudes in people that are more con- ducive to divorce, for example the attitude that relationships are temporary and easily can be ended.\" Maybe a way to combat divorce, if combat is the correct term here, is to have a child. No parents want their children to grow up in two different homes. Could bringing a child into this world help bring a married cou- ple closer together, not only for the sake of the child, but for their sakes as well? In Tim B. Heaton's \"Marital Stability Throughout the Child-Rearing Years,\" he says the most stress- ful time in a marriage is after the first child is born. Me added, \"Couples who have a child together have a slightly decreased risk of divorce com- pared to couples without chil- dren, but the decreased risk is far less than it used to be when parents with marital problems were more likely to stay togeth- er 'for the sake of the children.'\" I was most amazed by the percentage of males to females who file for divorce For a while, I thoiu;ht more males filed for divorce. According to \"These Boots Are Made For Walking: Why Most Divorce Filers Are Women\" by Margaret lining and Douglas Allen, 67 percent of divorces are filed by women. Wow. So, what can be learned from this data? Is there something about American culture that sees divorce as completely nor- mal and appropriate? [n the movie \"Coyote Ugly\" (2000), one of the characters who got married remarks, \"I think he is a perfect choice for my first husband.\" Is there something in our subconscious that prepares us to deal with divorce and just move on? More importantly, is there something in our subconscious that tells us to look for partners for the short-term and disre- gard those that are potential \"life partners?\" The Crossroads Christian. rVUowship Web site says matrimo- ny is a \"sign of the union between Christ and the Church and there- fore is permanent \u2014 divorce is unacceptabk'.\" Does that mean those that divorce are unethical, immoral? Of course not. Different people view different ideas in dif- ferent ways, and marriage is hotly debated, as is abortion and the death penally.

The reason is that we IH .i |oll society. Now, I don't mean the soli drink. What I mean is that our lives move (mm one adrena- line rush to the next, or from one shock to another. On tele vision, a jolt is any event that breaks the pattern of mean- ing, like a gunshot or a sud- den cut to another view. In a simple way, we, the television soiiely, have changed reality to be like fantasv A jolt is not always a bad thing. It can be an unexpect- ed letter from Mom and Dad with a $100 bill nestled inside. We would all like a lot more of those. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a jolt as well, if anyone is looking for good earth-shaking )olts So why the return to nor- malcy? We're waiting for the next big jolt. Princess Diana's death jolted us so much that when Mother Teresa pasM.j away the next week we barely blinked. When big jolts hap- pen too fast, we don't keep up. Wc can handle, however, mild jolts, like wild p.irtu-s about twice a week I'ro/ac can be a jolt we get used to every day, and a coffee |olt might happen three or four times a day Sept. 11 was a big jolt, though, and nothing has hap- pened since then. Oh sure, we bombed the snot out of some caves and then let the Taliban and the Northern Alliance kill each other, but compared with hijacked flights and burning buildings, a minor skirmish like Afghanistan doesn't appear on our jolt screens. So we revert to nor- malcy, waiting for the next important news bulletin to give temporary meaning to our lives. The better question to ask is: Why are we a jolt society? Some (like our moms) would say the reason is too much w\\v\\ ision and those video games from hell. 1 think the reality lies in what we are told we could be, but never really will. Let me explain. We constantly sec images of successful sports stars, ele- gant entertainers and power- ful politicians. They are what we could be, only if. If we had more money, talent, connec- tions or a better body, be it of the athletic or sexy variety. But we're not, or at least reali- ty says we're not. We are the TV society, however, and we will make reality look like fantasy, or spend a lot of money and time trying. So we wear designer threads, work out and search for the perfect look, the perfect high and, of course, the perfect mate. We try to get to the top, but we'll settle for a jolt \u2014 an adrena- line boost so we can have, for a moment, an exciting life. As recently as 70 to 80 years ago, our grandparents and great-grandparents didn't try to act like the wealthy in their society. They couldn't, they knew it, and they didn't worry about it. I don't know about the rest of the JMU stu- dent body, but my ancestors were farmers. They worked on other peoples' farms because there is no Sharp family farm, no ancestral estate. Life was slow and jolts were birthdays, weddings, funerals and when the barn burned. The world was out there, beyond the fence, except when war intruded to kick them out of Europe to continue the same life here in America. I'll bet that most JMU stu- dents didn't come from mil- lionaire families or noble lin- eages. Your ancestors may not have been farmers, but they weren't powerful or rich. We may not choose when we were born, but we can choose how we live. We can endlessly strive for the unattainable life through our jolts, or we can look for a bet- ter life, a life not based on comparison with the elite of our world but with what gives us self-fulfillment. There will always be jolts, true. They only matter so much when we need them to feel better. Adam Sharp is a sophomore foreign language major who tries not just lo survive, but lo thrive without jolts \u2014 and loves it. w r\\i\\ D ._ _J m - Program changes beginning Fall 2002: .

Those days have long passed, and although an itchy throat and a ninny nose still indicate the same illness, the benefits are not so great. Missing even one day of classes results in hours of catching up on missed assignments. For this reason, students seek the most effective cures, and some are delving into alternatives to over-the-counter medication. Although over-the-counter medication is the method chosen by most people to rid themselves of winter illnesses, recent studies show alternative medicines are sometimes more effective in battling the winter blahs. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (www.nccam.nih.gov), \"(alternative medicine) covers a broad range of healing philoso- phies (schools of thought), approaches and therapies that mainstream Western (con- ventional) medicine does not commonly use, accept, study, understand or make avail- able. A few of the many CAM practices include the use of acupuncture, herbs, home- opathy, therapeutic massage and traditional oriental medicine to promote well-being or treat health conditions.\" Kate's Natural Products, located on University Boulevard, specializes in alternative medicine. Opened in 1969, Kate's Natural Products carries a wide assortment of alter- native healing sources. \"The products we sell are intended to promote homeostasis of the body,\" owner Ralph Magri said. \"These products are not a comparison (of over-the-counter medi- cines). Those provide symptomatic relief. (Alternative medicines) are designed to help the body into a state of health.\" Sue Gibson, of Sue's Natural Products on South Main Street, added that side effects of alternative medicine are minimal. \"The body adapts to them better; they're more readily accepted,'' Gibson said. Alternative medicines differ from traditional Western medicines in that rather than one product for multisymptoms, each separate medicine has specific healing powers. Magri said the best-selling products at Kate's seem to be those that fall into the anti- septic groups. \"Antiseptics are effective in that they kill fungus, viruses and bacteria,\" Magri said. Among the best sellers are echinacea, oil of oregano, olive leaf extract and black elderberry. Echinacea, an herb rapidly becoming one of the most popular herbal reme- dies in the United States, according to The Natural Pharmacist's Web site (www.tnp.com), has been found to reduce the durations of the common cold and flu. The herb has been shown to boost white blood cell counts by assisting their maturity, according to the November 2000 issue of Prevention magazine. \"I have been taking echinacea with goldenseal for about three or four years,\" senior Matt Brancato said. \"The goldenseal is used to clean your body out. I rarely get sick.\" In addition, Brancato uses jade screen tea pills to boost his immune system and give him more energy. \"You can use them when it gets cold out, during the flu season or when you feel like your energy is down.\" According to Magri, oil of oregano kills bacteria, olive oil leaf extract mutates and kills bacteria and black elderberry has been shown to greatly reduce flu symptoms. For colds, which many people often suffer from during the winter season, Magri sug- gests homeopathic medicines, which he calls the modern medicine\" because they've been#around for centuries. \"The symptoms for which each medicine treats is written right on the label,\" added Magri. Gibson said that keeping the immune system boosted is probably the best thing peo- ple can do for themselves. \"Diet is crucial. A person should include plenty of veggies and water.\" Necessities in every person's cupboard include a good quality base multivita- min/mineral supplement. Magri said they are difficult to find in the mass market, but they are out there. Extra dosages of vitamin C should also be included in one's diet. \"Antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C and E are important,\" Gibson said. She also added that taking these vitamins in combination pills is not as effective as taking them separately. Zinc, a common ailment to treat symptoms of the common cold, is also helpful to have during the winter months. Senior Tara Howard said she found that taking zinc as soon as she feels a cold coming on reduces the duration of her symptoms. If money is tight, many homemade remedies are available in ordinary kitchen ingre- dients. Prevention magazine lists chicken soup, garlic, honey, lemon and eucalyptus as defenses in destroying bacteria. Soup broth replaces lost fluids; garlic is an antibiotic and antiviral as well as an expectorant, which helps cough up bacteria in the lungs; honey soothes the throat and traps bacteria; lastly, lemon helps glands salivate, making it easier to swallow. Gargling with warm salt water also soothes tissues in the throat. Yet, despite the increasing popularity of herbal remedies, the University Health Center asks that students be cautious when choosing their alternative medkfalM \"Students should check to see what ingredients are included,\" Assistant Director Cannie Graham said. \"A lot of (herbal medicines) are not FDA approved.\" This season, when that prickly feeling starts up in your throat, do some research, check out the alternatives and find what's right for you. the alternatives Echinacea (Purple Coneflower) Possible Effects: Potential natural antitoxin for internal and external infections May relieve symptoms of cold and flu May help heal wounds Possible antitumor activity May increase immune function after cancer treatment Elderberry (Elder) Possible Effects: May help treat headaches, the common cold, fevers, sore throat May help treat skin irritations May ease the discomfort of menstrual cramps Tea Tree Oil Possible Effects: May help soothe tonsils with tonsillitis May help treat bladder infections May reduce cold / flu symptoms Zinc Benefits: Promotes cell division, repair and growth Maintains normal level of vitamin A in blood Boosts immunity in zinc-deficient people Linden Tree Possible Effects: May treat coughs May decrease thickness and increase fluidity of mucus in lungs and bronchial tubes May reduce fever Burdock Known Effects: Stimulates the immune system Spirulina (Blue-green Algae) Possible Effects: Possible energy booster May protect immune system Astragalus (Huang-qi, Milk Vetch) Possible Effects: May reduce fatigue/weakness Potential cold and flu treatment Bayberry Known Effects: Reduces nasal congestion Reduces fever Possible Effects: May treat the common cold Blessed Thistle Possible Effects: May help reduce fever May reduce headache s,,ur..- Vitamins: Herbs Mimr.iK .mil Supplemenls by H.

Love is Here. sec Jlory below \"[E-Motion is] great to expose artists around campus...\" SHARLEE KENNEDY senior IM story below Juniors Christopher Baidoo and Amanda Claytor let feelings fly as a set of passengers In -Hellcab.\" Review 'Hellcab' steers toward sincerity BY BRENNA WALTON staff writer Think back to the last time you took a cab some- where. Chances are you heard about some of the exploits that fill the days and nights of one of those war- riors of public transit. In Will Kern's \"Hellcab,\" directed by sophomore Ryan McWilliams and performed this week al Theatre II, the audience is allowed the opportunity to experience one turbulent day in the life of a cab driver in Chicago. In the play, the cab driver, played by senior Mike Setti, comes into contact with a series of customers, all who reveal an aspect of their per- sonality or daily existence. Each scene introduces a new character and mood, ranging from tense to hilarious to heart-wrenching. As the driver begins a new journey with each cus- tomer, his eyes are opened to yet another face of humankind. He is then left to reflect on his driving experi- ence after the customer has paid a fare and departed. Setti plays his role with sincerity and dry wit. His character is put through a variety of scenarios, and he brings each situation to life by expressing the different facets of his personality. Setti's character can pro- vide the tough exterior nec- essary when a drunken pas- senger gets aggressive, he plays off the hysteria of a couple on their way to the hospital to have their first child, and he tenderly lets his guard down when con- fiding in a passenger about his feeling of helplessness after dropping off a woman who had confided in him that she had just been raped. As the play continues, the driver becomes increasingly aware of some of the less- than-admirable people in the world and that bad things often happen to good people for no reason. The rest of the cast proved to be just as talented. Each actor took on the daunting task of finding a way to uniquely portray each of his or her characters in only a few minutes' time. Each actor plays four or five characters, effectively dis- playing their versatility. Junior Amanda Claytor plays each of her characters with a larger-than-life pres- ence. She is able to create characters that are tough yet funny and likable, morphing from a put-together lawyer to a Jerry Springer-esque MBOHAN MONTGOMERY/inuur nhototrtwhtr Junior Lauren Paradise and sophomore Andy Park are among the eclectic bunch of passengers that senior Mike Setti drlvas In hit night's work In \"Hellcab.\" character named Shalita. Junior Lauren Paradise also has a wide range of tal- ent, playing a crazy old lady, a religious zealot and a kinky exhibitionist. Paradise pres- ents a heartbreaking portray- al of a woman who has just been raped and searches for consolation by confiding her pain to a stranger. Other characters, played by junior Christopher Baidoo, freshman Arianne Warner and sophomores Andy Park and Tim Bambara, deliver strong, humorous and. at times, con- troversial performances. \"Hellcab\" deals with a number of serious issues, such as racism and homophobia. and takes a toll on the audi- ence's emotions. Yet, the play provides resolve for the slate of things lo come; it makes audience members think. \"Hellcab\" will be per- formed at Thealre II at 8 p.m. through Saturday with a mid- night performance on Friday. Tickets cost 52 and may be purchased at the door.

Nothing relieves stress for me like searching all the Dot-Com booksellers and publishing houses for signs of upcoming books. Spring 21102 offers quite a few selections, many of which arc paperback ver- sions of novels from last summer and fall. There are, however, a few books I've decided readers everywhere, from the heights of Ihe Blue Ridge Mountains lo the depths of Carrier Library, should notice. Perhaps one or two of these books might tease whatever literary inclination you have \"My Country Versus Me\" by Wen Ho Lee with Helen Zia (released Jan. 15) \u2014 The Los Alamos scientist who vs.i^ iccustd (,i MptafiMM In IS99 lells his own rendition of the events surrounding his imprisonment and trial by the us. government The hook seta oil to explain the events of the past and illus- trates why Lee downloaded the secret atomic codes that t'wntu.illy brought him into conflict with Ihe govern- ment.

Minol's new novella (a tame 112 pages) concerns an affair between a production designer and an engaged film director during a shoot in Mexico.

The British band has become a phenomenon in i(^ native country and is sure to win over American audi- ences with its blend of soulful lyrics and rich beat! Following in the footsteps of such British bands of The Charlatans UK and Stereophonies, Starsailor h.is all the ingredients to become a breakthrough hit. Reminiscent ot the musical stylingsot the late Jeff Buckley, whose most mainstream hit was the i..te-'vi)sheart-tugging \"Last Goodbye,\" and the dark melodic tendancies ot former Verve bontman Richard Ashcroft, Love is Here is .1 breath of fresh air Although dMimtivly British, Starsailor's sound is truly original and a standout among the current trends in rock music.

Senior runner Roscoe Coles says he sees no reason this team shouldn't be just as competitive as last year's. \"Al .1 team this year we should do exceptionally well,\" Coles said. \"Coming off of a successful but some- what disappointing end of the season last year, we are looking to make a statement early this year. If everyone runs to their capabilities there should be no reason why we wouldn't qualify for the NCAA meet this year.\" Coles, who considers himself one of the leaders on the team, was the 200- meter champion at the IC4A meet last year and also earned All-American status in 2001. Despite his senior leadership role on the team. Coles says that everyone on the team has the capability to lead, including fellow senior Anthony Wallace. \"As a team, we are all leaders,\" Coles said. \"We all play a roll in encouraging each other and motivating each other. If I had to pick two guys though, I would say Anthony Wallace and myself are two of the main leaden We are both able to lead by example and vocally.\" Senior runner Eric Post says he agrees that both Coles and Wallace are the two main leaders on the team adding. \"Both are leaders because they're great athletes and have proven their ability to compete on a national level. Guys on the team look up to them for that reason and look to them for inspiration.\" 6 6- a really great job,\" Harris said. \"She really works hard and has had some excellent practices. There are other people on the team that can do that also, but as far as doing what she needs to do, Mollie does that very well.\" Senior runner Suzanne Hutchins says she feels that the upperclassmen on this team, similar to those over the past few years, also have been able to shoulder the leader- ship load. \"I think that without having see TRACK, page 25 ... we are looking to make a statement early this year. \u2014 Roscoe Coles senior, runner 55 On the women's side, coach Gwen Harris, who is entering her 16th year at the helm, said she likes what she sees out of her young group of athletes for the upcoming season. \"Last year's team was mostly all freshmen,\" Harris said. \"Now they're sopho- mores, but we have a couple of seniors who are stepping up to the plate and doing an excellent job. Thai's the dif- ference, though, they're growing, and it takes a little while for those guys to kind of get into the program and get themselves organized.\" Despite the youthful look of her group, Harris believes that junior runner Mollie Defrancesco is among the team's leaders entering the 2002 season. \"I would say Mollie leads by example because she docs SALT LAKE '02 A Torchbearer's Tale PILE PHOTOMw 1..1 Z\u00bb\u00abfr JMU travels to the Virginia Tech Invitational this weekend. BY BILL PLASCIIKF Los Angeles Times Did you see who was hand- ed a flame? Amid hundreds of heroes, a lousy storyteller. A guy who sees Olympic rings and thinks, five iced crullers. A guy who can't ski. A guy afraid to light a match. Yet Tuesday they gave Mot an entire flame, in a torch, down on the cor- ner of 14th and Stanford. Asked him if he could run SALT Jfe 2Q02 two blocks with 099 nobody chasing him Asked him if he could do it while holding a three-pound weight that was not imprinted with the words, \"Rocky Road.\" Asked him to please not bum the city down. He said he would try. It was an honor for the torch to pass through hLs town on the way to Salt Lake City next month for the Winter Olympics, so he would try. But sitting on the shuttle bus with other Olympic torchbearers early Tuesday afternoon, his legs were cement and his will wavered. He didn't belong. He knew that now. They picked the wrong guy. How could he do this? Sitting across from him on the bus was an 80-year-old torchbearer who teaches inner- city children to ski. Behind him, a torchbearer who gives life to premature inl.inls In the middle of the bus, a liver transplant survivor. And in the back row, a kid who beat Hodgkin's disease. \"So why are you here?\" someone finally asked the story- teller. \"I'm not sure,\" the story- teller said. As Olympic moments go. the start of this story carried all the emotion of a slalom prelimi- nary, only without the annoying beeps. \"Hey, you wanna carry the Olympic torch?,\" asked the sto- boss. \"For the United States'\" aaJd the storyteller 'Well, urn ...\" said the boss. The torch, as the storyteller was quickly reminded, is not about countries. That is its beauty. That is the one thing that separates it from virtually every other part of the Olympic movement, including those five rings. The torch does not recognize differences in continents or lan- guage. It is the same torch whether it is held by the doctor from West Covina or west Africa. The flame is one color, and many colors. The hands that hold it can been old and wrin- kled, young and smooth, brown or yellow. The only requirement, it Mama, is that those hands be strong The -.Ion, teller looked at his liands. They were not particu- larly stmng. These hands had never cured a child or rescued an ani- mal or bettered the world. fhese hands, even while wearing gloves, had no right holding the most endearing symbol of the world's most important sports event. The storyteller signed up anyway. He thought it would be fun. He filled out forms and affi- davits. He promised he would not use the torch as a croquet mallet, a birthday candle or to defend himself against Shaq. He promised that, for his entire two-tenths of a mile, he would keep his head up and his shoes laced. One day last week, a pack- age carrying his torchbearer's uniform arrived. The storyteller's wife unwrapped the box, her eyes darting from the uniform to the storyteller's belly, uniform to belly, uniform to belly. Then she screamed. \"It's torn?\" the storyteller asked. \"It's white!\" she shouted. One crash diet later, the story- teller was rumbling along the streets of l.os Angeles with a busload of heroes, a piece of flatware among this city's finest china. \"Again, they asked, \"So why are you here?\" Again, the storyteller could- n't answer.

Soon after the end of another so-so season, a long, black limou- sine pulls up at Redskin Park and spits out a multimillionaire coach with a glistening resume and a knack for saying all the right things at his first news conference. Former University of Florida coach Steve Spurrier became Snyder's fourth head coach in the space of less than two years when he was hired earlier this week to replace Marty Schottenheimer. Me also became the highest-paid head coach in the history of professional foot- Kill with a five-year, $25 million contract, which isn't bad for a guy who has never coached a game in the NFL. \"1 realize I'm one lucky guy to be coaching the Washington Redskins,\" Spurrier said. He might want to ask Schottenheimer or Norv Turner about that. Throw in interim coach Terry Robiskie, and Snyder is averaging one head coach for every five regular-sea- son games dating to Turner's departure after the 13th game of the 2000 season. Schottenheimer said the same kind of things when he sat next to Snyder on the NUN stage at the Redskins' headquar- ters a year ago, but his four-year, $10 million deal was terminated after just one .500 season. Spurrier likely will get a much longer leash, based on his enormous guaranteed salary and his apparent ability to defer lo his volatile owner, but the challenge will be the same. He must put the Redskins back on the Super Bowl track in short order and do so with- out invoking the wrath of an employer who has been com- pared unfavorably with the 1970s version of New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. Spurrier obviously knows what he has gotten into, but he seems to be comfortable with the direction that Snyder has indicated the Redskins will go during this off-season. \"Only time will tell, but I BREEZE RKADKK'S VIEW BRAD RICHARDS ( HICK M WVXWKRTCiimpu* Steve Spurrier Is the fourth Redskins coach In two years. believe that Dan Snyder wants to win for the Washington Redskins, the fans and the.iiv.i.\" Spurrier said Tuesday- \"1 think we're on the same page. I don't think we'll have t(x> many dif- ferences If we do, Mr. Snyder will win, but I'm sure he'll listen to me quite a bit\" Snyder was all smiles alter outflanking several NIT. NNDN with his aggressive pursuit of the popular Florida coach. l >h\\ lously, my expectation is the same as that of every Washington Redskins fan,\" Snyder said, \"restoring the greatness and tradition of this team, getting back to the play- offs and getting another Super Bowl victory.\" The next order ol buriMM for the controversial owner will be hiring a general manager, something he said will happen in the next few weeks. Spurrier's first challenge will be assembling a coaching staff, which he said will include sev- eral members of his University of Florida staff, \"two or three\" members of the current Redskins staff and an experi- enced defensive coordinator from outside the organization Then comes the task of eval- uating the roster and formulat- ing a plan for next season. \"I'm real excited about the opportunity,\" Spurrier said. \"There are a lot of good players on this tcuii This U'.mi is capa- ble of having a big year next year I low big? We'll find out.\" The Redskins are coming off an uneven season during which they lost the first five games before winning five straight and finishing with eight victories in their last 11 games. The strong finish appeared to vindicate Schottenheimer's my-way-ortliehighway coach- ing philosophy, but he alienated a few of the core veterans of the team along Ihe way. Spurrier said that he would take a different approach in practice, one that emphasizes execution and involves only a modest amount of contact, but he stopped short of criticizing Schottenheimer's coaching philosophy. \"Marty Schottenheimer is a friend of mine,\" Spurrier said. \"I have a lot of respect for him and I think he did a great fob here. But that's history now. We're going forward.\" Ravens vs. Steelers highlights second week of NFL playoffs First-round winners in Ihe NFL playoffs have knocked out the lightweights and are turning their attention to the heavyweights that are well rested and ready to go into this weekend swinging after getting a bye week. The wild-card games of last weekend showcased vic- tories by teams who played tough defense and executed their passing games. The scene of this weekends' Divisional games are going to be played in much the same manner. Key matchups and who wins them are going to determine what teams survive another week in order to enter the squared circle of the Conference championships. Oakland Raiders vs. New England Patriots The Oakland Raiders have answered the critics by prov- ing that the wide receiver duo of Jerry Rice and Tim Brown is not too old, and the arm of Rich Gannon still has enough \"umph\" to throw touchdowns. After posting 38 points in a victory over the N.Y. jets and throwing the ball for 287 yards, the Raiders need to continue throwing the ball if Oakland is to walk out of Foxboro with a win. The Patriots, after com- pleting a story book regular season, are looking for the same type of magic and hero- ics that they have come to expect from Pro Bowler Tom Brady. The inexperience of Brady is going to be key. If Oakland's secondary can force turnovers, the Patriots might struggle. Controlling the clock and running the ball will be a must if the Patriots hope lo play on for another week. Raiders 24, Patriots 17 Baltimore Ravens vs. Pittsburgh Steelers The key match-up in this Richards' NFL Playoff Predictions Raiders 24, Patriots 17 Steelers 17, Ravens 10 Rams 35, Packers 17 Eagles 19, Bears 13 game is going to be the abili- ty of Ihe Steelers backs to run against the hard-hitting defense of the Ravens. Wild- card weekend might have awakened a sleeping giant. The Ravens defense has been good, but taking a trip to Miami (the state where they won the Super Bowl last year) and beating the Dolphins last week brought out the sights and sounds of the 2001 Ravens. The trash talking and bone-crushing hits are back. Baltimore's defense must stop the Steelers from break- ing long runs and needs to keep the score low. The Steelers will probably look to control the game as they did the Iwo previous times these teams squared off this sea- son. Plaxico Burress needs to step up if the Ravens focus on stopping the run The pre- vious meetings of these two teams were split, but with execution like the Steelers had before they should win. Ravens 10, Steelers 17 Green Bay Packers vs. SI. Louis Rams After a disappointing season last year, Brett Favre and Green Bay are looking very strong. The Packers passing game is effective, and Ahin.in Green is going to need a big game running if they hope to control the tempo and keep the Rams high-powered offense off the field. Favre is one of, if not the, best passing quar- terback in the league, and the \"Cheese heads\" will need his best effort if they have any chance. The Rams are coming into this weekend very confident, as well they should. The Rams have the NFL's MVP Kurt Warner and MVP run- ner-up Marshall Faulk play- ing at the top of their game. Warner is going to need great pass protection in order to stretch the defense and hit his targets down field. Faulk will put up his numbers, but the Packers must get help in the sec- ondary or they will find themselves a few steps behind the Rams receivers all day. Packers 17, Rams 35 Philadelphia Eagles vs. Chicago Bears This game, like the Baltimore/Pittsburgh game, will be a low-scoring contest. The Eagles enter this game with Donovan McNabb returning to his hometown. McNabb will try to put on a show for his homecoming, but Brian Urlacher and the stingy Chicago defense will make the Eagles' day a strug- gle. McNabb will have to use his receivers in order to win this battle. \"Da Bears!\" are a young team that will be dependent on a big game from their defense. If Chicago's offense brings any rhythm into the game Saturday it will surely be stopped by the Philadelphia defense that boasts a lot of talent and many blitz schemes. The Eagles will come out of this game a winner after shutting down the Bears offense and getting points from the kicking game. Eagles 1\u00b0, Bears 13 Brad Richards is a sopho- more SMAD major who checked, double-checked and re- checked his NFL player and team information for accuracy in this week's playoff preview.

Mood in tront of the bus and ended the debate. \"Each o( you is here because somebody has seen the (lame within you and your power to spread that flame,\" she said. \"That's what this day is about.\" She gently held up an actual torch. \"Read it,\" she said. Then-, in litters that streaked toward tin* shinv metal base, were the words. I ie,ht the (ire within.\" As the shuttle pulled up on the comer o( 14th and Stanford, the heroes sent him off not with stares, but chivrs Moments later, the flame arrived, in the hands of a wide- eye high school girl running in memory of friends who had bom killed in an auto accident. I he storyteller tipped his torch, and the fire jumped. Now, it was his \"Remember,\" Keller had said earlier \"for those few min- utes, you will be the only person in the world who has that flame.\" The storyteller n'membered. As the orange and blue heat flapped wildly in his face, he did the only thing he could think of doing. On an oily patch in the mid- dle of 14th Street, he dropped to one knee. It was only for a second. He figured he had to thank some- body. And then he was off, jogging between rows of aging ware- houses that suddenly awakened with faces and hands. Through the flame, he could see the smiles. Even with the whirring of the security motor- cycles, he could hear the cheers. It didn't feel as though he was carrying the flame. It felt as though he was the flame. The more he stretched out the torch in his left hand, the louder the cheers. He stretched out his right hand, more cheers, as if he were carrying two torches. Then the storyteller under- stood what the heroes have always seemingly always known, the one thing they were trying to tell him. Spreading your fire is no more difficult than opening its arms. Every couple of years, the Olympics embrace the world by simply opening its arms. The storyteller thought, this is easy. He then turned and opened those arms to the guy ninning behind him. His name is Ted Hayes. He is the founder of our Dome Village homeless shelter. He was not a torchbearer. but a support runner, a per- son invited to run along with the flame in case the torch- bearer falters. The storyteller thought, why wait? He asked Hayes to grab a piece of the torch, and together they carried it. \"Man,\" said Hayes, shaking his dreadlocks. \"Man,\" said the storyteller. T\"ey j\u00b088ed to the end of the two-block stretch, where the storyteller then tipped the flame and passed it to the AIDS fighter. An official then drove up and turned off the gas, extin- guishing his flame. The caravan of cars and trucks moved ahead, the little street became quiet, then the strangest thing happened. It v\u00bbas if the torch lit itself again. A warehouse worker walked up. \"Can I touch it?\" he said. Another person walked up, and another, each asking only to touch the used torch. A vagrant walked up, hold- ing a tiny money clip containing what looked like one dollar. \"Here's my wallet as collat- eral,\" he said. \"Can I touch it just for 10 seconds?\" Sure, said the storyteller, to the warehouse worker and vagrant and anyone else drawn to the flame that briefly filled a tiny comer of our great town. Touch it. Everyone, please, touch it. able results from tin Father Diamond Invitational held Jan. 12 4 x 4011-meter relay Miehara Chltty, Fr. Crbtal Clarke, So.
