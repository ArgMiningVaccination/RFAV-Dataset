But did you know that a bath can also be used to detox your body? By using essential oils in your bath, they can help to remove toxins from your skin. In the busy world of today, people come in contact with an endless amount of impurities, toxins, poisons, pollutants, and other agents. These chemicals land on our skin, absorb into the fabrics we wear, and are breathed into our lungs. These toxins can build up over time and wreak havoc on our health. For example, they mimic estrogen and trick our body into thinking we are producing it. When in fact, we are not. This starts a vicious cycle that disrupts hormones which causes a whole slew of health problems. As inevitable as this may seem, there are a few ways that we can reduce the exposure to these environmental impurities, and one of the simplest ways, is through taking a detox bath.

What are the Benefits of a Detox Bath? The goal of a detox bath is to help your body release toxins and regenerate its natural defenses. The benefits from taking a detox bath vary from person to person because everyone has different needs from the process. The detox bath is a remedy for the body and the soul. It's a way to get rid of everyday stress and feel refreshed. The use of essential oils will also help you clear your head and feel relaxed. There are few benefits that come with a detox bath which you might not have thought about before: - It will help lower your risk of diseases - Improve skin tone after toxins have been removed from the skin - Promote longevity - Help you sleep better at night. Taking a relaxing bath is one of the best ways to reduce stress, especially after a long day. Detox baths stimulate the evacuation of toxins from our body, and can also help reduce inflammation. Detox Baths Relieve Stress Bathing for cleanliness is only a small portion of the health benefits from this ancient innovation and pastime. For thousands of years, mankind has known that one of the most relaxing and soothing experiences that can be had is that of taking a warm, or hot bath. Heat loosens muscle tissues that have been clenched by stress, as many people subconsciously carry stress in shoulders, backs, legs, and neck muscles. Detox Baths Stimulate the Evacuation of Toxins In daily modern life, the most common position for people is sitting. This means that toxins and other wastes can easily build up in the body causing blockages and other unpleasant ailments. In order to have a healthy body, it is important to work on clearing out your lymph system. One way this can be accomplished is through heating the body, thus making it easier for the lymph system to flow more freely. Detox Baths Reduce Inflammation Due to the acidic content of modern foods, swelling or inflammation in adults has reached epidemic levels. A long soak in warm or hot water can provide some relief by greatly reducing inflammation in joints and other tissues. A gentle, but firm rub while submerged can go a long way to improving circulation and arterial health. Essential Oils to Use in a Detox Bath There are many different essential oils that can be used in a detox bath. The key is finding the right one for your specific needs. Some people prefer to use eucalyptus or peppermint oil for their detox baths because they have antiseptic properties. Others prefer lavender oil because it offers a calming effect.

In a detox bath, essential oils are added to hot water to create a relaxing environment. It helps with the detoxification of the body and mind by releasing toxins from the skin and respiratory system. First off, the most important part of doing a detox bath, is that you have to be hydrated. If you are dehydrated, it will make it possible for you to be able to reap all of the benefits of the bath. It's important to be sure that your systems are hydrated enough to be influenced by the heat of the water. Drink plenty of water before your detox bath, and continue to drink lots of water after your bath to help the continued release of toxins. Next, select your water additives.

Benefits of Baking Soda in Your Detox Bath Baking soda is a cheap, effective, and accessible way to detoxify the body. It helps to relieve the symptoms of acid reflux and heartburn, as well as to cleanse the colon. It can also be used as a natural teeth whitener or deodorant and it has many other uses. Baking soda is an excellent source of sodium bicarbonate which is necessary for digestion, blood pressure regulation and pH balance in the body. Bicarbonate ions are also important for brain function. It is believed that baking soda helps detoxify the body because it has a pH level of 9, which is close to our skin's pH level of 5.5-6.5. When baking soda reacts with water, it releases carbon dioxide bubbles that help remove toxins from our pores and also have a cleansing effect on our skin by removing dirt and oil from our pores.
