Marma points is a term that comes from an ancient form of energy healing, originated within the 5000-year-old Ayurvedic system of medicine. These energy points, also known as [acupuncture or acupressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acupuncture) points in [Chinese Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) play a direct role in both Ayurvedic and yogic healing practices. In this article, we'll cover the below: - What Are Marma Points - How Marma Points Work - How Marma Points Can Be Affected Negatively - Marma Points Ayurvedic Massage - Benefits Of Marma Points Ayurvedic Massage Let's dive in! What Are Marma Points In the ancient [Vedic](https://yogajala.com/what-is-advaita/) era, marma points were considered mystical points situated on the outer self in the physical body (annamaya [kosha](https://yogajala.com/anandamaya-kosha/)). When these points are pressed, they are thought to activate a passage to the inner self. Marma points are generally engaged nowadays in massage, or therapy, within the context of ayurvedic healing and medicine. The Vedic scripture tells us the body encompasses a total of 107 marma points, each serving a specific purpose, with its individual name and exclusive massage technique. These physical marma points are positioned at the convergence of tendons, bones, muscles, joints, veins, nerves, and other tissues. The choice of Ayurvedic massage oils when it comes to massage is determined by an individual's Ayurvedic [dosha](https://yogajala.com/ayurvedic-massage-oils/) type. In total, there in fact exists [108](https://yogajala.com/sacred-number-108/) marma points\u2014107 on the physical body as mentioned, and 1 in the mind. As examples, here are some of the marma points found in your head region: |Phana marma||found symmetrically at the base of the nostrils, measuring half a finger point| |Apanga marma||found symmetrically at the outer sides of both eyes, measuring half a finger point| |Vidhur marma||found symmetrically behind and below both ears, measuring half a finger point| |Shankha marma||found symmetrically at both temples on the head, measuring half a finger point| |Utkshepa marma||found symmetrically where the hair meets the forehead on either side of the head, measuring half a finger point| |Avarta marma||found symmetrically midway above both eyebrows, measuring half a finger point| The age-old Ayurvedic healing system emphasizes that healing originates from within the body itself. Stimulating these marma points, through this passage to the inner self, encourages the body to address illness and pain. It also tells us these points play a pivotal role in promoting overall well-being. Each marma point is linked to a particular name and health benefit and comes with its own appropriate massage technique for activation. While marma points can be highly effective in promoting good health, they should be approached with care as they can also be used to inflict pain or paralysis in certain martial arts. In the realm of Ayurveda, however, marma points are exclusively employed for their therapeutic properties and are never intended for harmful intentions. Marma points are measured in 'finger units' with each point having distinctive features. For example, the Hridaya marma, symbolizing 'heart,' is situated at the sternum and extends four finger units. The optimal technique for this particular marma point involves gentle palm massage with oil, nurturing the heart's energy. This oil can enhance circulation, while acupressure at this juncture assists in alleviating stress and negative emotions. Ancient healing experts meticulously charted the precise locations and effects of marma points on various body parts. How Marma Points Work These marma points, or junctures of the body, function on the vital energy force of [prana](https://yogajala.com/prana/), joined by energy channels throughout the body, called [nadis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadi_(yoga)). Here, we outline the principles of how marma points work: 1. Pranic Flow In Ayurveda, the concept of [pranic flow](https://yogajala.com/prana-energy/) suggests that vital energy, known as prana, flows through the body, nourishing and sustaining all aspects of life. 2. Energy Centers Marma points serve as gateways, facilitating the entry or exit of prana within the body. These marma points are regarded as energetic centers, acting as intersections that link the physical body with the mind and spirit, where both the physical and subtle energy bodies converge. 3. Influence On [Doshas](https://yogajala.com/dosha-quiz-13/) Each marma point is associated with specific doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), and its stimulation can influence the balance of these doshas in the body. 4. Healing And Stimulation Through the application of pressure, massage, or other therapeutic techniques to these marma points, it is believed that the flow of prana can be stimulated or harmonized, leading to various health benefits. 5. Release Of Blockages Marma point massage is thought to be effective in releasing blockages and imbalances in the pranic flow, thereby alleviating physical and emotional discomfort. 6. Integration Of Body And Mind Stimulating marma points is believed to enhance the connection between the physical body and the mind, fostering a sense of well-being and harmony. 7. Specific Functions Each marma point is associated with unique functions, and Ayurvedic practitioners leverage this knowledge to address specific health concerns or promote overall vitality. How Marma Points Can Be Affected Negatively The flow of prana from the nadis to and through the marma points is essential for overall well-being. On the other hand, if the energy becomes stagnant or its flow is disrupted, it can lead to health problems. Numerous common practices have the potential to disturb the natural prana flow through the marma points, including: - Overexposure to UV - Sedentary lifestyle without exercise - Artificial lighting over natural lighting - Consuming unhealthy food - Poor sleep patterns - General stress Despite maintaining a relatively healthy lifestyle, living in our current day and age can still impact the healthy flow of life force into your body. Ayurveda attributes several aging-related processes, such as fatigue, stiffness, memory loss, fragile bones, and sensitive digestion, to the degradation of the body and mind caused by the stifling of these marma points. Marma Point Ayurvedic Massage Or Therapy Marma points are generally used in Ayurvedic massage to influence subtle energy or prana, but they are also highly useful for physically easing sore muscles and increasing circulation. The [Ayurvedic](https://yogajala.com/what-is-ayurveda/) practice of marma treatment is widely practiced and is seen as crucial to self-healing and self-care. The secret to better health and happiness doesn't always reside outside of ourselves, but as we learn through the practice of yoga, be it in asana practice or [Karma Yoga](https://yogajala.com/karma-yoga/) and so on, the key is within. At the core of marma point therapy lies an elaborate and intricate energetic framework, which is believed to have laid the foundation for other popular point-based therapies such as acupuncture, acupressure, and reflexology. Every cell in the body has a memory, and according to Ayurveda, these memories get retained, causing blockages that prevent prana (life force energy) from freely flowing through this framework. The generation of hormones and the condition of the important organs are both thought to be impacted by stimulating the marma points and moving this stuck energy. Initially, the knowledge of Ayurvedic vital energy points served dual purposes: ancient warriors utilized specific marma points to incapacitate opponents in combat, while Ayurvedic physicians applied other marma points to facilitate healing. Interestingly, the term \"marma\" itself translates to 'a point that can kill,' underscoring the importance of some of these points in martial arts as mentioned before. In the realm of marma point massage, these specific points serve a singular purpose - harnessing their therapeutic qualities. Termed also as neurolymphatic points, they actively contribute to lymphatic drainage and optimize the functionality of the body's organs. A marma master would possess the rare and profound knowledge of manipulating or directing prana (life energy) to achieve either specific violent or therapeutic outcomes via these marma points, as a combatant, or as a healer.
