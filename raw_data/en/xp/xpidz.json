Although this is my first annual message, I have been involved with and contributed to past reports during my tenure as a member of the Pharmacy Enterprise. I would like to give a sincere thank you to Indu Lew who has been our division 's leader and mentor for the last few years, including the majority of 2022. Indu 's guidance, support and leadership has been instrumental in the success of all pharmacy services within RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH). The Pharmacy Enterprise is an integrated system of divisions with responsibility for clinical, financial, quality, safety, and social outcomes related to medication use across the continuum of care in RWJBarnabas Health. Our enterprise has 25 divisions comprised of 14 hospital divisions and 11 integrated service divisions. A detailed summary of each of these divisions is enclosed within the pages of this annual report. Communication continues to be the fundamental principle in driving the success of Pharmacy Leadership at each of our divisions. The results produced by each division over the course of 2022 truly reflect a team effort that combines leadership, clinical, business and financial talents from individual hospital pharmacy department and division as well as a corporate pharmacy perspective. This report is intended to highlight and explain many of the incredible achievements our team has realized over the last year. These extraordinary accomplishments are attributed to the talents and precision focus of our group in actively seeking excellence for our health system. The past year brought several changes to our organization. Our health system bid a fond farewell to its esteemed leader Barry H. Ostrowsky and enthusiastically welcomed Mark E. Manigan to the helm as President and Chief Executive Officer as well as the appointment of John W. Doll to the role of Chief Operating Officer at RWJBH. Our organization 's new Senior Leadership Team worked diligently to develop and implement a service line approach to align practice and services across our organization. The service line approach includes a clinical and business executive dyad supported by interdisciplinary teams to create goals and tactics to enhance patient care and financial performance. Over the course of 2022, RWJBH continued to enhance integration across all its divisions, facilities and service lines through a \"One System -One Family \" philosophy. RWJBH eagerly welcomed Trinitas Regional Medical Center (TRMC) into the RWJBarnabas family of hospitals at the start of the year. The Pharmacy Enterprise transitioned the TRMC contracted pharmacy management staff to RWJBH employees and saved $815K by June 2022. Additionally, the pharmacy enterprise completed the integration and conversion of their 340B and Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) programs into ours, which produced additional savings for the organization. Clinical and operational lines of communication were opened between TRMC and the rest of the system allowing for enhanced collaboration and sharing of best practices. The COVID -19 virus with all its variants continued to be a strain on our hospitals and pharmacy departments from both a staffing and drug supply perspective throughout 2022. Pharmacy supported RWJBH 's mass vaccination efforts at the Bridgewater Mega Center as vaccines and medication treatments continued to be administered to our patient and employee populations across our organization. Pharmacy also continued to work with New Jersey Department of Health and federal partners to ensure that clinics could provide these essential treatments and meet regulatory requirements. Every facet of healthcare has been impacted by COVID -19, yet the Pharmacy Enterprise has continued to maintain balance, provide optimal and safe patient care, all while ensuring operational efficiency in health -related areas. The year brought additional challenges to our team members including preparations for a potential Ebola outbreak, a Mpox outbreak and a triple - demic of pediatric respiratory viruses that strained the nation. Our organization was able to overcome many of these challenges with pooled resources and agile decision making. Members of the Pharmacy Enterprise Pharmacy Enterprise 2022 Annual Report 6 One System -One Family A MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF PHARMACY OFFICER were integrally involved with various teams to ensure providers and patients had access to the best care available. As in previous years, education and post -graduate pharmacy training was a major focus for the Pharmacy Enterprise. Over 500 students were precepted in 2022 and Barnabas Health Behavioral Health 's PGY2 received a prestigious 8 -year accreditation from ASHP. The RWJBH Residency Leadership Forum graduated its 6th class and started training its 7th class in various leadership topics to create a pool of highly qualified clinicians with leadership expertise. Over 145 pharmacy residents have received this training since the program 's inception in 2016. The Pharmacy Enterprise continues to align with Rutgers University to provide faculty and real -world training opportunities across our organization. The acute care facilities were hard at work on a wide variety of clinical initiatives including order set and practice guideline development, creation of 38 standardized system policies and procedures, and increasing biosimilar medication utilization. The Pharmacy Enterprise worked across multiple disciplines to establish standard sedation assessment scoring for all sites, implement new medication therapies for stroke management, and standardize intravenous drug concentrations to promote patient safety. The formation of a system vaccine advisory committee led to standardization of vaccines in influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B across all acute care facilities. In conjunction with the System Quality and Standards Division, the Pharmacy Enterprise developed an interdisciplinary System Formulary Committee that allows the organization to align medication selection and practice to provide optimal patient outcomes at all RWJBH sites. In Ambulatory Pharmacy, our 4 embedded ambulatory pharmacists continue to focus on improving outcomes in chronic disease state management in our primary medical group. In the Community and Retail Pharmacy Divisions, although we closed two retail pharmacies for consolidation and financial savings, we expanded our Dispensary of Hope outreach to Trinitas patients and Greenville Pharmacy. The organization did elect to close our Employee Mail -Order Pharmacy. Patients that utilized LSC Mail Order Pharmacy were transitioned to Amazon and Accredo. Qualitas, our Specialty, Infusion and Warehouse Pharmacy Divisions have continued to grow in support of our system hospitals and patients. They have been able to increase the number of limited distribution drugs available to our system and continue to grow 340B contracted pharmacy dollars. We also expect additional increases in this program 's revenue in 2023 as they expand into additional therapeutic areas, aligning with our system 's service line approach. As Epic roll -out continued in 2022, pharmacy provided on -site and virtual support to the facilities that went live with the new system as well as the Epic teams that develop the system. Order set development, project management and issue resolution are a few of the many ways that the Pharmacy subject matter experts ensured the success of the project. The Pharmacy Enterprise is enthusiastic about providing clinical content to support the 2023 scheduled Epic expansion phases. Pharmacy team members from across the organization provided consultation and guidance for a myriad of safety enhancements to our Clinical Information Systems, including Epic, Cerner, AllScripts, Pyxis and drug information programs. Pharmacy 's focus on patient safety and clinical/operational excellence will be the backbone for providing ongoing support for all our service lines and the evolution of the Clinical Information Systems we utilize. The 340B Division had a busy year. Trinitas Regional Medical Center was integrated into the compliance and contracted pharmacy programs with no additional resources. As outlined later in this report, there was a dramatic increase in savings and revenue for the Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH) and Hemophilia Treatment Center programs. The Corporate Pharmacy team also worked with corporate and local finance departments to consolidate all 340B Contracted Pharmacy revenue and expenses into local hospital profit and loss reports. Completing this consolidation allows for all facilities to easily account for how this critical program impacts each site. Additionally, the 340B team aided in the implementation of BD Logistics at RWJ University Hospital. A MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF PHARMACY OFFICER Pharmacy Enterprise 2022 Annual Report 7 Actively Seeking Excellence A MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF PHARMACY OFFICER The Pharmacy Reimbursement Division (PRD) identified and recovered potentially lost medication reimbursement for our system through their talent along with relentless and persistent effort. Their ongoing work with our 340B and drug replacement programs has contributed to additional savings and revenue generation, as outlined in this report. To align with the system service line approach and the \"One System -One Family \" philosophy guiding our organization, Pharmacy leadership has chosen the word \"Unify \" again for 2023. While Unify was at the cornerstone of our work in 2022, the pharmacy enterprise will continue to collaborate on unification of strategy, services and initiatives throughout 2023. This word centers on the essential principles of harmonized health system workflows in anticipation of the migration of additional sites onto the Epic Clinical Information System Platform and the continued integration with Trinitas Regional Medical Center.

Congress passed the 340B Program as part of the Veterans Health Care Act in November of 1992. The program 's intent was to aid safety -net providers whom serve the nation 's most vulnerable patient populations in \"stretching scarce federal resources as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services. \" Pharmaceutical discounts extended to covered entities range anywhere from 15 to 60 percent. RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) has been able to transform these savings into increased access to care and medication for eligible patients in underserved communities with the greatest need. The RWJBH 340B Program began with a single hospital over 10 years ago. The health system has since expanded into seven disproportionate share hospitals (DSH) and one hemophilia treatment center registered with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as 340B covered entities. Each covered entity has Contracted Pharmacy agreements with a local retail network, including RWJBH retail and specialty pharmacies. These arrangements further increase access to affordable medication for our eligible patients. The RWJBH pharmacy enterprise has a central role in the initiation, operations, compliance and auditing of this complex program. This requires a coordinated effort between local facilities and the corporate pharmacy 340B team with the support of our 340B software vendor. The 340B team ensures RWJBH covered entities provide all required data to essential external vendors and routinely conduct data integrity reviews to maintain accuracy and compliance. RWJBH facilities participating in the 340B Program are subject to audit by drug manufacturers, HRSA, and internal audit from the Corporate 340B Division. Failure to comply with 340B Program requirements could result in refund of discounts back to a manufacturer(s) or potential expulsion from the program. During 2022 the Corporate Pharmacy 340B Team integrated the health system 's newest hospital, Trinitas Regional Medical Center, into the system 's 340B operations and Buyers Collaborative. Over 3,000 pharmaceutical invoices and nearly 700 patient dispensations were reviewed system wide through internal auditing. Additionally, approximately 7,000 suspected 340B eligible claims were reviewed for program compliance and acceptance. RWJBH covered entities received $3.4 million in contract pharmacy revenue due to manual ordering processes facilitated by the 340B Team. The team 's efforts, executed with limited resources, helped to ensure compliant 340B Program utilization. Through continuous evaluation of 340B Program operations, the team has continued to increase efficiencies and maximize program benefits for the RWJBarnabas Health System.

The Centralized Warehouse model allows for the procurement of bulk, reduced - cost purchases and the direct purchases of products on national shortage. Direct purchases prevents interruptions in supply chain management and patient care. Specific products are brought into the warehouse as needed based on mitigation for future possible supply interruptions and prior to known price increases. Smart bulk purchases lead to large cost savings to the RWJBH system. In 2022, the Centralized Warehouse was crucial in support of the RWJBH system by procuring products that were in short supply. Specific items such as Albuterol inhalers, Terbutaline, Amoxicillin, and Valproate were brought in to supply the hospitals during the pediatric surge in 2022. This continued through key partnerships and direct accounts with manufacturers and other vendors. In addition, 2022 brought over $5 million dollars worth of cost -savings pharmaceutical purchases through the Centralized Warehouse. The Centralized Warehouse was also able to provide another $3 million dollars worth of products that were not available through our wholesaler and on national supplier shortage. The Flu vaccine is also brought into the Centralized Warehouse and then dispensed to each hospital as needed. This allows for easier supply chain shipping and a better coordinated return process. For 2023, the goal is to continue to expand our bulk cost -savings model by bringing in high usage, high dollar products. We will continue to strengthen our partnerships with mfg 's and vendors to bring in any product that the system may need during supply chain interruptions in 2023.

Through the transformation of laboratory discoveries into clinical practice, we target cancer with precision me dicine, immunotherapy and clinical trials and provide the most advanced, comprehensive, and compassionate world -class cancer care to adults and children. This mission is being accomplished in partnership with RWJBarnabas Health. Rutgers Cancer Institute physicians and scientists work side -by-side to make sure the most sophisticated treatments are delivered to our patients quickly and safely - the future of cancer treatments today. In 2022, Rutgers Cancer Institute Cared for over 66,000 outpatient clinic visits to the center, Treated over 40,000 patient treatment -visits to Adult Infusion and Pediatric Infusion. Dispensing nearly 94,000 doses Of these treatment -visits, 14.5% (or 4141) of patient visits involved a patient enrolled onto a therapeutic clinical trial. To support these service, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey employs: 7 Board Certified Oncology Pharmacist supporting clinical care 7 PharmDs supporting the infusion center operations and cleanroom 7 Certified Pharmacy Technicians (CPhT) with certification in Compounding Sterile Preparations (CSPT) and Handling of Hazardo us Medications Researchers from Rutgers Cancer Institute have made outstanding scientific contributions towards the national goal of reducin g the incidence of cancer and improving the outcomes for cancer patients. Rutgers Cancer Institute coordinates basic, clinical and population research through five comprehensive research programs comprised of faculty who form cohesive, interdisciplinary gr oups supported by peer -reviewed grants and Rutgers Cancer Institute shared resources. Close to 250 Rutgers Cancer Institute faculty members garner more than $100 million annually in federal, state, and philanthropic grant support. Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey is a part of Rutgers Health, one of the most comprehensive academic health care provid er organizations in New Jersey, offering a breadth of accessible clinical care throughout the State supported by the latest heal th-related research and education. Rutgers Health connects health care providers across disciplines, including doctors, nurses, dentists , physician assistants, pharmacists, clinical psychologists, and social workers, with a single focus: helping people and popula tions get well and stay well by delivering consistent, coordinated, value -based health care. As oral chemotherapeutic agents become used more readily for the care of cancer patients, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jer sey, along with Qualitas Specialty Pharmacy are working in conjunction to better the patient treatment experience. The goal of thi s Oral Oncolytic program (Specialty Rx Access) is to dispense oncology specific medications to patients, to reduce the cost of filli ng unnecessary medications, reduce distribution costs, ensure patient safety and adherence, and to comply with risk evaluation a nd mitigation strategy programs. To overcome the traditional, specialty pharmacy model as stand -alone or mail -order operations with no affiliation with the patient 's practice -based oncology care team, our Health -System now has an internal specialty pharmacy service, which are highly integrated with the patient 's oncology care team. This model matches best practice in the literature described as a closed -loop collaboration between the oncology practices and an internal specialty pharmacy access programs and results in positive clinical outcomes as well as both patient and provider satisfaction. The model includes two full -time pharmacists and 1 technician within the Cancer Institute and 1 dedicated FTE at Monmouth Medical Center and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. This service has grown to a $30mil revenue generating program locally and a $52mil revenue generating program when including all RWJBH sites under the oncology service line. In response to the COVID -19 pandemic and as an opportunity to redefine the oncology care delivery model, CINJ / RWJBarnabas Health launched a pilot aimed at providing home infusion oncology treatments and other high -cost injectable drug treatments for eligible CINJ patients as an alternative to an infusion center. Last year, Rutgers Cancer Institute of NJ / RWJBH in collabor ation with Qualitas Indusion Services, concluded this pilot program for home infusion of chemotherapy. Outcomes and Results: Nearly 10 0 patients have been enrolled into the program and there are an additional 100+ patients are undergoing screening and evaluatio n. The program has been well received among patients with a patient satisfaction survey score of 98%. Positive comments included convenience, alleviating anxiety, and nursing professionalism. This pilot has changed the standard of care for how & where w e administer certain chemotherapy regimens to patients with the benefit of creating capacity in our infusion areas and improvin g patient satisfaction. Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey now offers a broad scope of chemotherapy infusion in the home se tting. I n t e g ra t e d S e r v i c e L i n e Michael P.

A medication use evaluation (MUE) is a performance improvement method that focuses on evaluating and improving medication use processes with the goal of optimal patient outcomes. The MUE process helps to identify actual and potential medication -related problems, resolve actual medication -related problems, and prevent potential medication -related problems that could interfere with achieving optimum outcomes from medication therapy. Specific MUE objectives include: Promoting optimal medication therapy Preventing medication -related problems Evaluating effectiveness of medication therapy Improving patient safety Standardizing medication use practices Promoting cost -effective therapy Meeting or exceeding internal and external quality standards Medications may be selected for MUEs for any or all of the following reasons: Medication is known or suspected to cause adverse reactions Medication is known to interact with other medications Medication is used in the treatment of high -risk patients Medication is frequently prescribed Medication has a narrow therapeutic index Medication is under consideration for formulary retention, addition or deletion Medication is expensive RWJBarnabas Health pharmacists play a large role in the MUE process. Specifically, they: Develop the operational plan Work collaboratively with prescribers and other health care professionals to develop criteria for specific medications and to design effective medication use processes Collect, analyze, and evaluate patient -specific data to identify, resolve, and prevent medication -related problems Interpret and report MUE findings and recommend changes in the medication use process Provide education based on MUE findings Providing high -quality, safe medical care is a primary goal at RWJ Barnabas Health As experts in medication delivery, pharmacists play an integral role in preventing and managing medication errors; however, ensuring safety in the health system is a team effort. Pharmacists need to broaden their responsibilities by taking on roles in quality and performance improvement projects. Pharmacists are well positioned to assist the healthcare system in improving quality of care as they are already established as experts in medication management processes. The RWJBarnabas Health Pharmacy Enterprise has a strong focus on Quality Improvement including initiatives such as the Medication Use Evaluation Program. In 2022, the Pharmacy Enterprise medication use evaluations were the following: Benchmarking antibiotic use data utilizing SAAR Decrease the Number of Opioid Prescriptions from Emergency Departments Obtain Top Three Status in Net Promoter Score for Qualitas Specialty Pharmacy Maintain Infection Rate Below National Benchmark in Home Infusion Maintain Library Pump Compliance System - wide of 95% Additionally, the following MUE was added: Monitoring Dosing Compliance for Direct Oral Anticoagulants Pharmacy Enterprise 2022 Annual Report 103 Actively Seeking Excellence Quality and Safety The RWJBarnabas Health Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP ) is a coordinated multidisciplinary effort, working in concert with the Pharmacy Infectious Diseases Collaborative, to promote the appropriate use of antimicrobials, improve patient outcomes, and mitigate the consequences of antimicrobial resistance across our hospitals and communities. The RWJBarnabas Health ASP is grounded in the CDC Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship. The ASP has fundamental procedures in place to meet the Core Elements, including surveillance of culture and sensitivity, de-escalation and escalation, IV to oral transitioning, and renal adjustment of antimicrobial therapy. In 2022, the Pharmacy Infectious Disease Collaborative along with the RWJBarnabas Health Antimicrobial Stewardship program completed the following initiatives: Developed a RWJBH guideline for the treatment of Clostridiodes difficile infection Expanded awareness of antimicrobial stewardship throughout the health system and our communities through the recognition of US Antibiotic Awareness Week Transitioned to the CDC endorsed Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR) for antimicrobial use tracking and benchmarking at all hospitals Future efforts of the RWJBarnabas Health ASP will focus on standardization of best practices across the system, collaboration with other key specialties and expansion of efforts into the outpatient setting. The Pharmacy Enterprise migrated to measuring quality initiatives in a control chart methodology. The graphs displayed above are control chart, used to study how a process changes over time. Data are plotted chronologically. A control chart always has a central line fo r the average (highlighted in red), and upper line for the upper control limit (highlighted in green) and a lower line for the lower control limit (highlighted i n purples). These lines are determined from historical data. Program Started Pharmacy Enterprise 2022 Annual Report 104 One System -One Family Quality and Safety The Opioid Use Reduction Initiative According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 750,000 people have died since 1999 from a drug overdose. Two out of three drug overdose deaths in 2018 involved an opioid. Every day, hospitals and health systems see the effects of the nation 's opioid epidemic. RWJBarnabas Health has been working to address this public health issue for many years. The system began its work with the formation of the Tackling Addiction Task Force. This Taskforce is a multi -disciplinary group of practitioners focused on: education, prevention, recovery, intervention and treatment. The taskforce empowered the RWJBarnabas Health Emergency Room Collaborative and the Pharmacy Enterprise to create an Opioid Stewardship Program. An Opioid Stewardship program is coordination of interventions designed to improve, monitor and evaluate the use of opioids in order to support and protect human health. This collaboration led to the development of the system DROP (Deliberate Reduction of Opioids) program led by the RWJBarnabas Health Institute for Prevention and Recovery This group has completed a number of steps to reduce opioid prescribing and increase access to treatment for opioid addiction: Clinician education on prescribing practices Creation of evidence -based order sets for pain management across entire system that focus on multimodal pain management to minimize opioid use Creation of opioid withdrawal prevention and treatment policy and order set/protocol for all sites Continual monitoring of opioid and alternative agent use at all sites through data analytics report converting all opioid prescriptions to morphine equivalents. ED and Inpatient review of disease states with highest levels of opioid use The number of ED patients discharged with an opioid prescription decreased from 2.25% in 2021 to 2.03% in 2022 ( 1,074 fewer patients or a 9.08% decrease). Given the 0.85% increase in ED discharges from 2021 to 2022, we would have expected to see 100 more ED patients discharged with an opioid prescription. In 2022, the Pharmacy Enterprise partnered with the RWJBarnabas Health Institute for Prevention and Recovery (IPR) and Rutgers Opioid Overdose Prevention Network (OOPN) to begin distributing naloxone. From second to fourth quarter of 2022, 218 naloxone kits were distributed to patients through IPR 's peer recovery specialists. Pharmacy Enterprise 2022 Annual Report 105 Actively Seeking Excellence Quality and Safety The RWJ Barnabas Health -owned Qualitas Specialty Pharmacy Division partnered with MMIT, a national health care consulting firm, to produce a Patient Survey Program to measure key performance areas affecting patient engagement. By standardizing a performance measurement tool, the intent was to make it easier for payors, manufacturers, patients and pharmacies to adequate ly understand and benchmark their performance against other organizations. The survey evaluated issues such as: Access Billing Overall Satisfaction Pharmacy / Staff Performance Prescription Fulfillment Willingness to Refer Friends or Family Members Key performance metrics around patient satisfaction were: Prompt Call Center Interactions Prescription Fulfillment Staff Listening Skills and Empathy Staff Knowledge of Disease and Medication The analysis compared other large Specialty Pharmacy Providers Net Promoter scores to the Qualitas Specialty Pharmacy Divisio n. A Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a cross -industry standardized index ranging from -100 to 100 that measures a customer 's overall satisfaction with a company 's product or service, as well as a customer 's loyalty to the brand. Determining an NPS allows for a comparison between specialty pharmacy and other service -oriented organizations in a variety of sectors. In 2022 RWJBarnabas Health 's Qualitas Specialty Pharmacy Division achieved one of the highest Net Promoter scores among Hospital and Health system -based specialty pharmacies in the United States according to MMIT. Pharmacy Enterprise 2022 Annual Report 106 One System -One Family Quality and Safety Home infusion therapy is a treatment option for patients with a wide range of acute and chronic conditions, ranging from bacterial infections to more complex conditions such as late -stage heart failure and immune deficiencies. Home infusion therapy affords a patient independence and better quality of life, because it is provided in the comfort of the patient 's home at a time that best fits his or her needs. It may also reduce the risk of hospital -acquired infections and provide improved safety and better outcomes for patients. Diseases that may require infusion therapy include infections that are unresponsive to oral antibiotics, cancer and cancer -related pain, dehydration, congestive heart failure, Crohn 's Disease, hemophilia, hepatitis, immune deficiencies, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The RWJ Barnabas Health Home Infusion Division through the dedication of its Home Infusion Nurses has maintained strict adherence to the Centers of Disease Control criteria for preventing intravenous line infections. Our nurses have consistently maintained an infection rate that is 18 times below the national benchmark. Pharmacy Enterprise 2022 Annual Report 107 Actively Seeking Excellence Quality and Safety Maintain Compliance with Intravenous Drug Library at 95% Smart infusion pumps combine computer technology and drug libraries to limit the potential for dosing errors. An infusion pump d rug library allows medications to be built within care areas and with minimum and maximum limits to facilitate safe infusion medi cation administration. A study published in 2016 found that bypassing the smart infusion pump or the drug library accounted for abou t 10% of the total number of errors or policy violations relating to infusion administration1. The Joint Commission realized the importance of optimizing utilization of smart infusion pumps and built -in dose error reduction software (DERS) and issued a Sentinel Event Ale rt in April of 2021.2 RWJBarnabas Health had set a goal to monitor pump compliance beginning in January of 2021 and look for opportunities to optim ize the DERS technology. The goal was to ensure compliance with the pump library for 95% of infusions. RWJBarnabas Health has successfully maintained the compliance goal of 95% for 2021 and 2022. This outcome will continue to b e monitored for 2023. 1Schnock KO, et al.

Pharmacy Enterprise 2022 Annual Report 108 One System -One Family Quality and Safety Monitoring Dosing Compliance for Direct Oral Anticoagulants For more than 50 years, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) - namely, warfarin - was the anticoagulant of choice for long -term treatment and prevention of arterial and venous thromboembolic events (VTE) as well as for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have grown in popularity over the last decade for pa tients with NVAF and VTE. DOACs have shown superiority or noninferiority to prior standards of care in reducing risk of thromboembol ic complications with similar or reduced bleeding risk. In comparison to conventional treatment with VKAs, DOACs offer many treatment advantages, including fixed dosing, fewer drug and dietary interactions, rapid onset and short half -lives, as well as no monitoring requirement. DOACs dosing poses many challenges as it varies depending on indication, patient age, renal function, weight as well as concomitant medication. Failure to take these factors into consideration can cause significant patient harm.1-3 In December 2018, the Joint Commission published a national patient safety goal (NPSG) to \"reduce the likelihood of patient harm associated with the use of anticoagulant therapy \" (NSPG 03.05.01). One of the requirements is that hospitals use \"approved protocols and evidence -based practice guidelines ...that address medication selection. \"4 The RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH) system formulary includes apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran. Due to the complexity of dosing as well as the high -risk nature of the medication, safety measures like pre -approved order sets are utilized to prevent medication errors. The pharmacy departments across the system have collaborated to update/add to the current practice to assi st in ensuring patient safety and quality in ordering DOACs. The purpose of this system -wide medication use evaluation is to assess the compliance of DOAC orders with the appropriate indication and dosing recommendation found in the RWJBH order set and the respective package inserts. 1Chen A, Stecker E, and Warden BA.
