Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean to have an Eating Disorder? Eating disorders are serious mental health disorders, which can impact a person's relationship with food, exercise and their body. There are different types of eating disorders and everyone's experience can be different. Eating disorders are not a lifestyle choice or vanity, and treatment can effectively help. What do all Eating Disorders have in common? A common factor across all eating disorders includes a disrupted relationship with food and eating habits. This can present in different behaviours such as food restriction, binge eating, purging, dieting or selective eating habits. Many (though not all) eating disorders also feature a strong emphasis on body image, weight, shape, appearance or 'health'. All eating disorders are serious, and can benefit from treatment. What is Orthorexia? Orthorexia is not formally recognised as an eating disorder diagnosis, but is gaining recognition and understanding. This pattern of disordered eating focuses on 'clean eating' or an obsession with 'health', including the quality, perceived benefits and morality of particular foods. Orthorexia can involve significant health consequences and disruptions in daily living due to the restrictive and obsessive relationship with food and body. What is Body Dysmorphia? Body Dysmorphia, or Body Dysmorphic Disorder involves an intense preoccupation with perceived 'flaws' or 'defects' in appearance, which is typically not noticeable to others. These perceived concerns typically involve specific facial or body features, and not concerns with overall weight or shape. People with body dysmorphic disorder may use repetitive or compulsive behaviours in an attempt to 'fix' or 'hide' the area of concern, e.g. make up, cosmetic procedures, mirror checking. Body dysmorphic disorder can have significant impacts on physical and mental health, including social isolation. What is Muscle Dysmorphia? Muscle dysmorphia is a subtype of Body Dysmorphic Disorder, where someone has a preoccupation with being insufficiently muscular or lean, which is distorted perception of their appearance. Muscle dysmorphia can involve obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviours with the purpose of trying to increase muscle mass e.g. compulsive exercise or gym use, substance or steroid abuse, and disordered eating. Muscle dysmorphia most often effects males, due to associations between muscularity and masculinity, although can affect anyone. Muscle dysmorphia can have serious physical and mental health consequences. How dangerous is an Eating Disorder? Eating disorders can be very dangerous and potentially life-threatening. This can be due to the serious physical impacts of the disorder, which can affect every organ of the body. The mental health consequences can also be severe, including self-harm and suicide risk. In addition, the impacts on important areas of life are also significant, including on socialising, work/school and hobbies. That said, recovery is possible, and many health impacts can be reversible with appropriate treatment. Who is most likely to have an Eating Disorder? Anyone can have an eating disorder, regardless of age, gender identity, body size or shape, sexuality, race, culture, ability, economic status or profession. While eating disorders do not discriminate, some specific experiences put someone at higher risk of developing an eating disorder, such as experiences of trauma, discrimination, or pressure to conform to societal or cultural ideals. Remember that anyone can have an eating disorder, and you can't tell just by looking at someone. What are some of the facts about Eating Disorders?
