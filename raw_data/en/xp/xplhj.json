The back-to-basics curriculum, pace of studies, and specific expectations for academic achievement and behavior require a firm commitment from every parent, student, and teacher. The ATS traditional program develops a solid foundation of fundamental and higher-level thinking skills through a structured curriculum that is consistent within each grade level and sequential throughout the grades. - [Register for the 23/24 School Year!](../../site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=8&ModuleInstanceID=8058&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=12380&PageID=9) Stop by or call 602-484-8816 to register your K-8 student for the 23/24 school year!
