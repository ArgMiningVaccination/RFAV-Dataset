Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Prior to introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), Streptococcus pneumoniae was most commonly isolated from middle ear fluid of children with acute otitis media (AOM). Reducing nasophar yngeal colonisation of this bacterium by PCVs may lead to a decli ne in AOM. The effects of PCVs deserve ongoing monitoring since st udies from the post-PCV era report a shift in causative otopath ogens towards non-vaccine serotypes and other bacteria. This updated Cochrane Review was rst published in 2002 and updated in 2004 , 2009, and 2014. The review title was changed (to include the popu lation, i.e. children) for this update. Objectives T o assess the effect of PCVs in preventing AOM in children up to 1 2 years of age. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science, and trials registers (ClinicalT rials.gov and WHO ICTRP) to 29 March 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of PCV versus placebo or control v accine. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Coch rane. The primary outcomes were frequency of all-cause AOM and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes included frequency of pneum ococcal AOM and frequency of recurrent AOM (dened as three or more AOM episodes in six months or four or more in one year). We u sed GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence. 1 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Main results We included 14 publications of 11 trials (60,733 children, range 74 to 37,868 per trial) of 7- to 11-valent PCVs versus control va ccines (meningococcus type C vaccine in three trials, and hepatitis A or B v accine in eight trials). We included two additional trials for th is update. We did not nd any relevant trials with the newer 13-va lent PCV. Most studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies . Overall, risk of bias was low. In seven trials (59,415 children ) PCVs were administered in early infancy, while four trials (1 318 children) included children aged one year and over who were either health y or had a history of respiratory illness. There was considera ble clinical heterogeneity across studies, therefore we did not perform m eta-analyses. Adverse events Nine trials reported on adverse effects (77,389 children; high -quality evidence). Mild local reactions and fever were common in b oth groups, and occurred more frequently in PCV than in control vaccin e groups: redness (< 2.5 cm): 5% to 5% to 12% 0% 8%; \u00b0C): 15% to 44% versus 8% to 25%. More severe redness (> 2.5 cm), swelling (> 2.5 cm), and fever (> 39 \u00b0C) occurred less frequently (0 % to 0.9%, 0.1% to 1.3%, and 0.4% to 2.5%, respectively in children receiving PCV) and did not differ signicantly betw een PCV and control vaccine groups. Pain or tenderness, or both w as reported more frequently in PCV than in control vaccine groups: 3% to 38% versus 0% to 8%. Serious adverse events judged causal ly related to vaccination were rare and did not differ signicantl y between groups, and no fatal serious adverse event judged ca usally related to vaccination was reported.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Authors' conclusions Administration of the licenced CRM197-PCV7 and PHiD-CV10 durin g early infancy is associated with large relative risk reductio ns in pneumococcal AOM. However, the effects of these vaccines on all-ca use AOM is far more uncertain. We found no evidence of a benecial effect on all-cause AOM of administering PCVs in high-r isk infants, after early infancy (i.e. in children one year and a bove), and in older children with a history of respiratory illness. C ompared to control vaccines, PCVs were associated with an increas e in mild local reactions (redness, swelling), fever, and pain and/o r tenderness. We found no evidence of a difference in more sever e local reactions, fever, or serious adverse events judged causally r elated to vaccination. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Pneumococcal vaccination for preventing acute middle ear i nfections in children Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus, a type of bacterium) for preventing acute middle ear infections in children. Background Before nationwide implementation of vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), pneumococcus was the most frequent cause of acute middle ear infect ions in children. Vaccination against this bacterium with PCVs may therefore lead to fewer acute middle ear infections in child ren. However, ongoing monitoring of the effects of PCVs on acut e middle ear infections is warranted since recent studies report a shift in bacteria causing acute middle ear infections towards pneumoco ccal types not included in the vaccines and other bacteria. Study characteristics The evidence is current up to 29 March 2019. We included 11 trials o f PCVs versus control vaccines (meningococcus type C conjugate vaccine in three trials, and hepatitis A or B vaccine in eight tria ls) involving a total of 60,733 children. The PCVs used in the t rials contained 7 to 11 different types of pneumococcus. None of the tri als used the newer PCV containing 13 different types. Most tri als were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Overall, risk of bias was low. In seven trials (59,415 children), children received PCV s in early infancy, and four trials included 1318 children aged one y ear and over who were either healthy or who had previous respi ratory illness or frequent acute middle ear infections. Key results When a licenced vaccine containing seven different types of pneumo coccus (CRM197-PCV7) was given during early infancy, the risk of experiencing acute middle ear infections either increased by 5% in high-risk infants or decreased by 6% in low-risk infants. Wh en administrating a licenced vaccine containing 10 types of pneumoco ccus together with a carrier protein from another bacterium calle d Haemophilus influenzae (PHiD-CV10), the risk of experiencing acute middle ear infections decreased by 6% to 15%, however neither of these estimates reached signicance. Giving PCV7 after early infancy (to children aged one year and ab ove), and in older children with a history of respiratory illne ss or frequent acute middle ear infections, was not associated with r eductions in acute middle ear infections. Mild local reactions (redness, swelling), fever, and pain/tend erness were common and occurred more frequently in children recei ving PCV than in those receiving control vaccines. More severe local re actions (redness and swelling > 2.5 cm) and fever (> 39 \u00b0C) occurred far less frequently and did not differ between vaccine groups. Serious adverse events judged causally related to vaccination were rare and did not differ signicantly between vaccine groups. Quality of the evidence We assessed the quality of the evidence for PCV7 in early infan cy to be high (further research is very unlikely to change our cond ence in the estimate of effect). We judged the quality of the evidence for PHiD-CV10 to be moderate (further research is likely to have an important impact on our condence in the estimate of effect and ma y change the estimate). We judged the quality of the evidence for PCV7 in older children with or without a history of respirator y illness to be high. 3 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Acute otitis media (AOM), dened as the presence of middle ear fluid together with one or more signs or symptoms of acute mid- dle ear inflammation such as otalgia, otorrhoea, fever, or irr itabil- ity, is one of the most common diseases in childhood and im- poses a large burden on public health ( Lieberthal 2013 ). Global AOM incidence rates are highest in children one to four years of age, with a peak incidence in six- to 11-month-old infants (Monasta 2012 ). By the age of two years, up to 5% of all children have experienced recurrent AOM, dened as three or more AOM episodes in six months or four or more in one year ( Kvaerner 1997 ;Lieberthal 2013 ). The three main bacterial pathogens iso- lated from the middle ear fluid of children with AOM collected before the widespread use of pneumococcal 1981 ). Recent studies have shown that nation- wide implementation of PCVs may have changed the frequency of the causative otopathogens involved in AOM towards pneumo - coccal serotypes not included in the vaccines and 2011 ). Description of the intervention The marginal benets of antibiotics for AOM in low-risk popula - tions ( Rovers 2006 ;Venekamp 2015 ); the increasing problem of bacterial resistance against antibiotics ( Laxminarayan 2013 ); and the high estimated direct and indirect annual costs associated w ith AOM have prompted a search for effective vaccines to prevent this condition ( Ahmed 2014 ;Boonacker 2011 ). With S pneumoniae a common causative pathogen in child- hood AOM and pneumonia, and one of the most frequent causes of invasive bacterial disease such as bacteraemia and meningit is, research has focused on the prevention of pneumococcal infections by pneumococcal vaccines. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPVs) have been available for decades, but have been shown to be poorly immunogenic in children aged up to two years, who are most prone to pneumococcal infections. In the most recent versions of this review, no further attention has been paid t o the effect of PPVs, which were described in prior versions of this re - view ( Straetemans 2003 ). The rst covalently conjugated to car- rier proteins, were developed in the 1990s and proved to be ad e- quately immunogenic in infants and toddlers ( Dagan 1997 ;Eskola1999 ;Shineeld 1999 ). Over the past decades, various PCVs have been developed for use in children including: licenced 7-valent PCV containing the meningitidis as carrier containing the capsular polysaccharides of serotypes 1 and 5 in addition to those included in conjugated to , and 23F) conjugated to protein D, which is a surface lipoprotein of H influenzae (PHiD-CV10 ); 11-valent containing the capsular polysaccharides of serotype well as those ( the might work Early and dense colonisation of the nasopharynx with bacteria l otopathogens, including S pneumoniae , increases the risk of ( Faden 1997 ;Leach 1994 ;Schilder 2016 ). As a con- sequence, reducing or eliminating nasopharyngeal colonisati on of S pneumoniae by PCVs may lead to reductions in AOM incidence. In recent years, evidence has accumulated that PCVs might also disrupt the continuum of evolution from pneumococcal-associ- ated otitis media (OM) OM by early vaccine-serotype AOM and thereby reducing subse- quent and more complex caused by non-vaccine non-typeable H influenzae (Ben-Shimol 2014 ;Dagan 2016 ). Why it is important to do this review With AOM amongst the most common diseases in early child- hood, the need for a vaccine to effectively prevent AOM is high. Over the past decades various randomised controlled trials ha ve been performed to assess the effects of pneumococcal vaccination to prevent AOM. From 2009 onwards, two multivalent PCVs (PHiD-CV10 and CRM197-PCV13) have been licenced and are being implemented in nationwide immunisation programm es worldwide ( WHO 2012 ). These new vaccines may have an in- creased benet in preventing AOM ( Marom 2014 ;O'Brien 2009 ). As such, it was important to provide an up-to-date systematic re - view on the effects of PCVs on preventing AOM. This review is an 8 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

As per previ- ous versions of this review, we excluded studies that did not r eport outcome data relevant for this review. T ypes of participants Children aged up to 12 years. T ypes of interventions PCV versus placebo or control vaccine. T ypes of outcome measures Primary outcomes 1. Frequency of all-cause AOM episodes dened as AOM irrespective of causative pathogen. We considered this to be th e most relevant outcome for children, parents, and clinicians. 2. Adverse effects including local (redness, swelling) and systemic reactions (fever), pain/tenderness, and serious adv erse events (SAEs) judged causally related to vaccination. Secondary outcomes 1. Frequency of pneumococcal AOM. 2. Frequency of with a serogroup that is included in the vaccine). 3. Frequency of recurrent AOM (dened as three or more episodes in the last six months or four or more in the last year ).Search methods for identication of studies The Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group (2018 search update) and Cochrane Infectious Disease Group (2019 search up- date) Information Specialists conducted systematic searches f or RCTs and controlled clinical trials. There were no language, pu b- lication year, or publication status restrictions. The date of latest search was 29 March 2019. Electronic searches For the 2014 review update, we used the search strategy presen ted inAppendix 1 . For this 2019 update, we searched the Cochrane Central Reg- ister of Controlled T rials (CENTRAL; Issue 3, 2019), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Specialised Register; MEDLINE (Ovid) (1995 to 29 March 2019); Embase to 29 March 2019); CINAHL (EBSCO) (Cu- mulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) (200 7 to 28 March 2019); LILACS (BIREME) (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database) (2007 to 28 March 2019), and Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics) (2007 to 28 March 2019). We used the search strategy presented in Appendix 2 to search CENTRAL and MEDLINE. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy for identi fy- ing randomised trials in MEDLINE: sensitivity- revision); Ovid format ( Lefebvre 2011 ). We adapted the Appendix 6 ). Searching other resources T o increase the yield of relevant studies, two review authors (ACF , RPV) reviewed the reference lists of all relevant studies and review articles retrieved. We searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing T rials Health Organization International Clinical T rials Platform 8 ) on 29 March 2019 for completed and ongoing trials. We furthermore searched the internet (via Goo gle using the search terms 'pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for acute otitis media trial') and the extended abstracts publish ed in the Recent Advances in Otitis Media (grey literature) on 29 March 2019 for any additional trials. Data collection and analysis Selection of studies T wo review authors (ACF , RPV) independently screened titles a nd abstracts obtained from the database searches and reviewed th e 9 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.full text of the potentially relevant titles and abstracts ag ainst the inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved by discus sion. Data extraction and management T wo review authors (ACF , RPV) independently extracted data from the included studies. Any disagreements were resolved b y discussion. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies T wo review authors (ACF , RPV) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included trials. Any disagreem ents were resolved by discussion. We assessed the methodological q ual- ity of included studies using the 'Risk of bias' tool as describ ed in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ). We judged the following domains as high, low, or unclear risk of bias: random sequence generation (se- lection bias), concealment of allocation (selection bias), blindin g of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of o ut- come assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (at- trition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), and other sources of bias. Measures of treatment effect We expressed estimates of treatment effects as relative risk s/hazard ratios with accompanying 95% condence intervals (CIs). Vaccine efcacy was estimated as 1 minus the relative risk/hazard rati o (relative risk reduction (RRR)). Unit of analysis issues We included all types of RCTs. In the case of cluster-randomised trials, we considered potential differences between the inte rvention effects being estimated and checked whether clustering was take n into account in the analysis of the individual trials. Dealing with missing data For each trial, we determined the number of missing data and whether the authors took duration of follow-up (and censoring) of individual participants into account in their statistical an alyses. Assessment of heterogeneity We rst assessed clinical heterogeneity across trials by revie wing the differences in the types of participants recruited, interv entions used, and outcomes measured. We did not pool studies where clinical heterogeneity made it unuseful to do so. Where studies were sufciently homogeneous, we proposed to assess statist ical heterogeneity for each outcome by visually inspecting the fore st plots and by using the Chi\u00b2 test and the I\u00b2 statistic.Assessment of reporting biases We proposed to assess reporting bias as within-study (outcome r e- porting) and between-study reporting (publication) bias ( Higgins 2011 ). Outcome reporting bias We searched the internet, ClinicalT rials.gov, and the WHO IC- TRP for available study protocols to determine whether outcom es reported were predened and whether all outcomes listed in th e study protocol were reported in the trial publications. Where i n- formation was insufcient to judge the risk of bias, we classi ed the risk of bias as unclear ( Higgins 2011 ). Publication bias We proposed a more formal method of assessing reporting bias , that is by creating funnel plots, if sufcient trials (10 or more ) were available for an outcome. Data synthesis We primarily analysed the available data according to the inte n- tion-to-treat principle, that is by analysing all participants in the groups to which they were originally randomised. As a secondar y analysis, we presented data based on a per-protocol analysis. Where possible, we proposed conducting meta-analyses using Re- view Manager 5 by calculating treatment effects with the Mantel - Haenszel method, using a xed-effect model where no substanti al statistical heterogeneity was present (I\u00b2 < 50%) ( Review Manager 2014 ). If substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected and u n- resolved by sensitivity analysis, we proposed to calculate tr eatment effects using a random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) model to provide more conservative effect estimates. Where clinical hete ro- geneity precluded meta-analyses, we reported the effect estim ates as presented by the individual trials. If possible, we repor ted the incidences of the various outcomes in the study arms together wi th the vaccine efcacy estimates, with 95% CIs. We proposed the following methods to conduct meta-analyses. The generalised Cox proportional hazard method proposed by Andersen 1982 is regarded as the most appropriate to assess the effect of PCVs on AOM ( Jahn-Eimermacher 2007 ). Under the as- sumption that the hazard rate is proportional between both g roups over time, and that the risk of AOM is not affected by previous episodes (although this is untrue), this model takes all avail able information into account, that is all episodes (including recur- rences), differences in individual patient follow-up time, and time until a case of AOM ( Jahn-Eimermacher 2007 ). However, infor- mation on individual follow-up time until the rst, second, th ird, etc. case of AOM is difcult to obtain for each study to be in- cluded in the meta-analysis. Poisson regression is based on th e as- sumption of a constant risk of AOM over time and that this risk i s 10 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.not affected by previous episodes of AOM. This method only re- quires the total follow-up time and total number of episodes, and therefore appears to be a more feasible method for meta-analy sis. Furthermore, Poisson regression seems not to be affected by t he deviation from a constant risk over time, having very similar results for the effect of PCVs on AOM to the Andersen-Gill approach (Jahn-Eimermacher 2007 ). For Poisson regression, the treatment effect is measured as a rate ratio dened as follows: (total AOM episodes in pneumococcal vaccination group divided by the num- ber of children in the pneumococcal vaccination group multiplied by the follow-up time in months) divided by (total AOM episodes in control group divided by the number of children in the control group multiplied by the follow-up time in months) ( McCullagh 1989 ). GRADE and 'Summary of ndings' table We created Summary of ndings for the main comparison for PCVs administered in early infancy using the following outcom es: frequency of all-cause AOM episodes (primary outcome), fre- of pneumococcal AOM, and frequency of recurrent AOM (dened as three or more AOM episodes in six months or four or more in one year) .We used the ve GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indire ctness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of eviden ce as it relates to the studies that contribute data to the meta-an al- yses for the prespecied outcomes ( Atkins 2004 ). We judged the quality of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. We judged evidence from RCTs that did not have serious limitatio ns as high quality. However, we downgraded the quality of evide nce to moderate, low, or very low based on the following factors: s tudy limitations (risk of bias), inconsistency (consistency of results ), imprecision (precision of results), indirectness of evidence (dir ect- ness of evidence), and publication bias (existence of publication bias). We used the methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for System- atic Reviews of Interventions cisions or upgrade the quality of studies using footn otes, and made comments to aid the reader's understanding of the re- view where necessary. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Because the effect of PCVs on AOM may be influenced by the age at which the PCV was administered, occurrence of previous AOM or respiratory tract infection episodes, and by the type ofPCV used, we described the studies accordingly, that is we strat i- ed those with vaccination in early infancy versus those with va c- cination later in childhood by type of PCV used. Sensitivity analysis We planned to carry out sensitivity analyses for risk of bias o f in- cluded studies to assess the robustness of review ndings by e x- cluding studies with high risk of bias (dened as high risk of al lo- cation concealment bias and attrition bias (overall loss to foll ow- up of more than 20% or differential follow-up observed, or bot h)) from meta-analysis.

Results of the search This review is an update of a Cochrane Review rst published in 2002 ( Straetemans 2002 ), and updated in 2004 ( Straetemans 2009 Jansen 2009 ), and 2014 ( Fortanier 2014 ). In the 2014 review, which included studies up to December 2013, we included nine RCTs, which were reported in 11 publications (Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Dagan 2001 ;Eskola Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ). For this update we searched electronic databases (December 2013 to March 2019) and retrieved 374 records. After removal of du- plicates, we assessed 225 records by title and abstract, and ide n- tied eight potentially eligible studies which we obtained i n full text. After reviewing the full texts, we excluded two publicat ions that were additional analyses of the Eskola 2001 study but did not include new outcome data useful to this review ( Palmu 2015a ; Sarasoja 2013 ), and three publications that were secondary anal- yses of the Finnish invasive pneumococcal disease (FinIP) vaccine trial but did not report on any of our outcomes of interest ( Palmu 2014 ;Palmu 2015b ;Palmu T regnaghi 2014 ;Vesikari 2016 , that two RCTs, T regnaghi 2014 ;Vesikari 2016 , that were suitable for inclusion. S\u00e1ez-Llorens 2017 was a further analysis of T regnaghi 2014 .

We did not identify additional relevant completed trials or a ny ongoing studies by scanning the reference lists of relevant sy stem- atic reviews or by searching the internet, the grey literatur e, and the trial registries ClinicalT rials.gov and WHO ICTRP . Included studies SeeCharacteristics of included studies . We included 11 RCTs reported in 14 publications ( Black 2000 / Fireman 2003; Dagan 2001 ;Eskola ;Vesikari 2016 ). We added two RCTs (reported in three publications) for this update ( T regnaghi 2014 /S\u00e1ez-Llorens 2017; Vesikari 2016 ).The included trials involved a total of 60,733 children. Study designs Of the 11 included studies, nine were standard, individually ran- domised trials, and two were cluster-RCTs ( O'Brien 2008 ;Vesikari 2016 ). Both cluster-RCTs took the cluster effect into account in their analyses. Study populations (early infancy versus later in life) In seven trials ( Black 2000 /Fireman 12 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.S\u00e1ez-Llorens 2017; Vesikari 2016 ), PCVs were predominantly ad- ministered in children's rst six months of life. Four trials ,Dagan 2001 ;Jansen 2008 ;van Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 , assessed the effects of PCVs administered at a later age on AOM in ei- ther healthy infants, Dagan 2001 , or in children with a history of respiratory illness or frequent AOM ( Jansen 2008 ;van Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ). were (Eskola 2001 /Palmu 2009; Kilpi 2003 ;Vesikari 2016 ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; O'Brien 2008 ), two in the Netherlands ( Jansen 2008 ;Veenhoven 2003 ), and the remaining in Belgium ( van Kempen 2006 ), Israel ( Dagan 2001 Re- public and Slovakia ( Prymula 2006 ), and Argentina, Colombia, and Panama ( T regnaghi 2014 /S\u00e1ez-Llorens 2017). Most of these countries had AOM diagnosis and management guidelines at the time of the study ( Tamir 2017 ). Interventions Type of PCV used and co-administration of other vaccines In six trials, CRM197-PCV7 was used as the intervention ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Eskola 2001 /Palmu ;van Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ). In two studies, a booster dose with 23-valent PPV (containing capsular polysaccharides of the serotypes ( van Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ). In one trial, CRM197-PCV7 was administered together with a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) ( Jansen 2008 ). Four interventions were used in ve trials: OMPC-P CV7 inKilpi 2003 (a subset of these PPV23 as a booster dose); CRM197-PCV9 in Dagan 2001 in T and PHiD- CV11 in Prymula 2006 . Comparator Control vaccines were used as comparators in all trials. Com- parator vaccines included meningococcus type C conjugate vac- cine (10 pro- tein Dagan 2001 ;O'Brien 2008 ), whilst hepatitis A or B vaccine was used in the remaining eight trials. Outcome measures Adverse effects were reported in nine trials including a total of 77,389 children ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2016 ).T /S\u00e1ez-Llorens 2017 was part of the Clinical Otitis Media and Pneumonia Study (COMPAS; clinicaltrials.gov /show/NCT00466947), which assessed the efcacy and safety of PHiD-CV10 against invasive pneumococcal disease, community- acquired pneumonia, and AOM in 23,821 young Latin Ameri- can children. Acute otitis media was studied in the Panama co- hort only, which included 7357 children, whereas safety data we re available for all 23,821 children. Six trials applied a standardised diagnosis of and one trial used standardised AOM registration forms to be completed by general practitioners ( Jansen 2008 ). In two trials, AOM episodes were extracted from a computerised data source containing all vi s- its registered by physicians ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; O'Brien 2008 ). T wo relied AOM episodes physi- cian-conrmed AOM as the outcome of interest. T wo trials assessed outcomes during influenza seasons ( Jansen 2008 ;van Kempen 2006 ). Seven trials also assessed the effect of PCVs on c) pneumococcal 2003 Three middle fluid from all AOM episodes ( Eskola 2001 ;Kilpi 2003 ;Prymula 2006 ), and one trial cultured middle ear fluid by tympanocentesis when fluid was suspected in the middle ear ( T regnaghi 2014 /S\u00e1ez- Llorens 2017). One trial only cultured middle ear fluid from the rst AOM episode by tympanocentesis or from spontaneously draining ears ( Veenhoven 2003 ). T wo trials assessed the effect on reported cultures that were obtained from spontaneously dra ining ears ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; O'Brien 2008 ). Three trials reported the effects of PCVs on recurrent AOM ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Eskola 2001 ;Prymula 2006 ). Three studies included all types of OM, including but not exclusively AOM, as an outcome ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Dagan 2001 ;O'Brien 2008 ). Funding and conflicts of interest Six trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies ( Black 2000 / Fireman; Eskola 2001 /Palmu 2017; Vesikari 2016 ). Three trials reported receiving support from non-commercial (governmental) sources, but study vaccines were supplied by pharmaceutical com- panies ( Jansen 2008 ;van Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ). One trial was supported both by a pharmaceutical company and govern - mental funding ( O'Brien 2008 ). One trial reported that study vac- cines were supplied by a pharmaceutical company ( Dagan 2001 ). Brief overview of clinical heterogeneity across included studies There was considerable clinical heterogeneity across the includ ed trials. There were differences in the timing of PCV administr ation, 13 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.that is trials administering PCV during infancy and trials ad min- istering PCV later in life. As such, study populations varied from healthy infants to those at high risk of AOM. Secondly, the num - ber of pneumococcal serotypes present in the vaccines, the type of conjugate method used, and co-administration of other vaccines differed substantially across trials. Study designs also va ried, in- cluding both individually randomised controlled trials and cl uster- RCTs. Finally, large differences in outcome assessments and A OM denitions were observed, varying from 'passive' (chart revi ew at the end of the trial) to 'active' (parents were instructed to vis it a physician in case of AOM symptoms) outcome assessments and physician-conrmed AOM episodes versus parent-reported AOM episodes. Consequently, AOM incidence in the control groups va r- ied widely across the studies administering PCV during infan cy, that is from 0.13 to 1.3 episodes per person-year. We therefor e did not perform meta-analyses. Excluded studiesIn the 2014 version of this review ( Fortanier 2014 ), four studies were excluded since they (i) did not include a control vaccine (Gisselsson-Solen 2011 ); (ii) did not report outcome data relevant for this review ( Jokinen 2012 ); (iii) assessed the effect of PCV on otitis media with effusion rather than AOM ( Le 2007 ); and (iv) reported the effect of PCV on suppurative otitis media in an abstract of a conference meeting ( Roy 2011 ). In this 2019 update, a further ve studies were excluded that did not repor t outcome data relevant for this review ( ). See Characteristics of excluded studies . Ongoing studies We did not identify any ongoing studies. Risk of bias in included studies We judged the methodological quality of the included studies t o be moderate to high. We presented the 'Risk of bias' assessme nt graphically in Figure 2 andFigure . Figure 2.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Allocation Eight included trials described concealment of allocation ade- quately, whilst this domain was assessed as unclear for three trials due to insufcient information ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Jansen 2008 ;Veenhoven 2003 ). We judged random sequence generation to be adequate in seven trials, whilst four trials provided i nsuf- cient information on methods of random sequence generation used ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Dagan 2001 ;Jansen 2008 ;van Kempen 2006 ). Blinding Although all studies indicated that trials were double-blind ed, three trials provided insufcient information about how bli nd- ing was performed ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Prymula 2006 ; Vesikari 2016 ). Incomplete outcome data We judged risk of attrition bias to be high in one trial ( Vesikari 2016 ), unclear in three trials ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Jansen 2008 ;O'Brien 2008 ), and low in seven trials. Selective reporting We judged risk of reporting bias to be unclear in six trials, Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; ;Veenhoven 2003 , and low in ve trials. Other potential sources of bias We judged risk of bias due to other sources (including balances in baseline characteristics, use of co-intervention across groups, pres- ence of formal sample size calculations, and (prespecied) inter im analyses) as unclear in three trials, Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Kilpi 2003 ;O'Brien 2008 , and low in the remaining eight trials. Effects of interventions See: Summary of ndings for the main comparison Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine versus control vaccine for preventing acute otitis media Effect estimates of the various PCV types, stratied by the ag e at which PCVs were administered and the occurrence of previous AOM/respiratory tract infection (RTI) episodes (i.e. administ ra- tion in early infancy versus later in life), on frequency of all-ca use AOM, (vaccine-type) frequency of pneumococcal AOM, and fre- of recurrent AOM (dened as three or more AOM episodes in six months or four or more in one year), are summarised inTable 1 ,Table 2 , and Table 3 , respectively. The main results for PCVs administered in early infancy are described in Summary of ndings for the main comparison . We included a total of 14 publications of 11 RCTs (60,733 chil- dren, range 74 to 37,868 per trial) of 7- to 11-valent PCVs ver- sus control vaccines. Seven trials included infants who predom- inantly received primary vaccinations before six months of age (59,415 children in total) Black 2016 ). One study in- cluded day-care attendees aged from 12 to 35 months (264 chil- dren) ( Dagan 2001 ). T wo trials included children aged from one to seven years with a history of AOM (457 children) ( van Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ). One trial included children aged from 18 to 72 months with a previously diagnosed RTI (597 children) (Jansen 2008 ). We have presented the results of individual trials as report ed in the published papers; meta-analysis was inappropriate due t o sub- stantial differences among studies. We have assessed the sta tistical methods used to analyse data in each study. Adverse effects (co-primary outcome) An overview of adverse effects reported in the individual stu dies can be found in Table 4 . Mild local reactions and fever were common in both groups, oc- curring more frequently in the PCV than in the control vaccine groups: redness (< 2.5 cm): 5% to 20% versus 5% to 12% 0% 8%; \u00b0C): 15% to 44% versus 8% to 25%. More severe redness (> 2.5 cm), swelling (> 2.5 cm), and fever (> 39\u00b0 C) occurred less frequently (0% to 0.9%, 0.1% to 1.3%, and 0.4% to 2.5%, respectively, in children receiving PCV) and did not differ signicantly betwee n PCV and control vaccine groups. Pain or tenderness, or both was reported more frequently in children receiving PCV than in tho se receiving control vaccines: 3% to 38% versus 0% to 8%. Serious adverse events (SAEs) judged causally related to vaccination we re rare and did not differ signicantly between vaccine groups. No fatal SAE judged causally related to vaccination was reported. The evidence for this outcome was of high quality. Acute otitis media outcomes (co-primary outcome and secondary outcomes) Seven studies used the generalised Cox proportional hazard method proposed by Andersen 1982 , currently regarded as the most optimal for analysing this kind of data ( Black 2000 Fireman vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley Sons, Ltd.2006 regnaghi ). Dagan 2001 compared rates of AOM, but rather than comparing them by Poisson or negative binomial regression analysis (wh ich would presumably yield results similar to those obtained wi th the Andersen approach), the Chi\u00b2 test was used, which is suboptimal for comparing rates. Jansen 2008 used Poisson, and Vesikari 2016 used negative bino- mial regression analysis to compare rates of AOM between grou ps, accounting for the potential dependency of observations betwe en individuals. O'Brien 2008 was a cluster-randomised trial that calculated inci- dence rate ratios with a Poisson regression with sandwich vari ance estimation to account for within-community correlation. Effect of PCV administered in early infancy (predominantly < 6 months of age) Seven trials (59,415 children) included infants who predomi- nantly received various types of PCV before six months of age (Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Eskola 2001 /Palmu (39,530 children), CRM197-PCV7 was the inter- vention for healthy infants aged two months ( Black 2000 /Fire- man 2003; Eskola 2001 /Palmu 2009). The same vaccine was used as the intervention in one trial including 944 Navajo and White Mountain Apache children aged up to two years. These children carry one of the highest risks of developing AOM in the world (O'Brien 2008 ). In one trial (1666 children), OMPC-PCV7, with a subset of chil- dren receiving PPV23 as a booster dose, was used as the interve n- tion in healthy infants aged two months ( Kilpi 2003 ). Primary outcome Frequency of all-cause AOM episodes In one trial including 37,868 healthy infants aged two months (Black 2000 /Fireman 2003), CRM197-PCV7 was associated with a 6% (95% condence (CI) (RRR) in all-cause AOM episodes in an intention-to- treat (ITT) analysis. Per-protocol analysis of a trial includin g 1662 healthy infants aged two months showed that this same vaccine was associated with a non-signicant 6% (95% Eskola 2001 /Palmu 2009). In young children who carry a high baseline risk of developing AOM, CRM197-PCV7 was not associated with a reduction ( O'Brien 2008 ). In one trial including 1666 healthy infants aged two months ( Kilpi 2003 ), OMPC-PCV7 was not associated with a reduction in all- cause AOM episodes in per-protocol analysis (RRR 1%, 95% CI12% to The the use of CRM197-PCV7 and OMPC-PCV7 in low-risk infants for this outcome was of high quality. Howev er, the evidence for use of CRM197-PCV7 in young children with high baseline risk of developing AOM for this outcome was of moderate quality; the evidence quality was downgraded one le vel due to imprecise effect estimate (one trial with a relatively sm all sample size). Secondary outcomes Frequency of pneumococcal AOM In one trial including 1662 healthy infants aged two months ( Eskola 2001 /Palmu 2009), CRM197-PCV7 was associated AOM episodes in per-protocol analysis, depending on whether this outcome was assessed by a composite of positive culture or positive pneumolysin polymerase chain reaction (PCR ) or by positive culture only. In one trial including 1666 healthy infants aged two months ( Kilpi 2003 ), OMPC-PCV7 was RRR in pneumococcal AOM episodes in per-protocol analysis. The evidence for this outcome was of high quality. Frequency of pneumococcal serotype-specic AOM In two trials (39,530 healthy infants aged months) ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Eskola 2001 /Palmu 2009), administration CRM197-PCV7 a 54% (95% CI 41% to RRR in vaccine-type pneumococcal AOM episodes in ITT analysis.

In one trial (944 children) ( O'Brien 2008 ), administration of CRM197-PCV7 in young children who carry a high baseline risk of developing AOM was associated with a non-signicant AOM episodes in ITT analysis. In one trial including 1666 healthy infants aged two months ( Kilpi 2003 ), OMPC-PCV7 was the same trial ( Kilpi CI 47% to 25%), and associated with a non-signicant 27% 17 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The evidence for use of CRM197-PCV7 and OMPC-PCV7 in healthy infants for this outcome was of high quality. However , evidence for the use of CRM197-PCV7 in young children with high baseline risk of developing AOM for this outcome was of moderate quality; the evidence quality was downgraded one le vel due to study limitations (risk of bias) and imprecise effect est imate. Frequency of recurrent AOM In two trials (39,530 children) ( Black 2000 /Fireman 2003; Eskola 2001 /Palmu 2009), administration of CRM197-PCV7 in healthy infants aged two months was associated with a 9% (95% CI 12% in developing recur- rent AOM. The evidence for this outcome was of high quality. PHiD-CV10/11 PHiD-CV10 was used as the intervention in two trials (12,307 children) ( T regnaghi 2014 /S\u00e1ez-Llorens 2017; (4968 children) ( Prymula 2006 ). Primary outcome Frequency of all-cause AOM episodes In one trial including 7359 healthy infants aged from 6 to 16 weeks ( T regnaghi 2014 in ITT analysis. Per-protocol analysi s of a trial including 5095 healthy infants aged from 6 weeks to 1 8 months showed that this same vaccine was associated with a non- signicant ). In one trial including 4968 healthy infants aged from 6 weeks t o 5 months, PHiD-CV11 was associated with a 34% (95% CI per-protocol analysis (Prymula 2006 ). However, it should be noted that the AOM incidence rates in the two trials with the largest point estimates, T regnaghi 2014 /S\u00e1ez- Llorens 2017; Prymula 2006 , were low ( Table 1 ). Consequently, the absolute risk differences in these trials were rather sma ll. The evidence for the use of PHiD-CV11 for this outcome was of high quality. The evidence for the use of PHiD-CV10 was of moderate quality; the evidence quality was downgraded one level due to study limitations (risk of bias) and imprecise eff ect estimates.Secondary outcomes Frequency of pneumococcal AOM In one trial including 7359 healthy infants aged from 6 to 16 we eks (T regnaghi 2014 /S\u00e1ez-Llorens 2017), PHiD-CV10 was 74%) RRR in pneumococcal AOM episodes in ITT analysis. In one trial including 4968 healthy infants aged from 6 weeks t o 5 months, PHiD-CV11 was associated with a 52% (95% CI ). evidence for pneumococcal AOM episodes of high qual- ity.

In one trial including 4968 healthy infants aged from 6 weeks t o 5 months, PHiD-CV11 was associated with a 58% same trial PHiD-CV11 RRR evidence for vaccine-type pneumococcal AOM episodes was of high quality. The evidence for cross-reactive serotypes and n on- vaccine-type AOM episodes was of moderate quality; the evidence quality was downgraded one level due to imprecise effect estim ates. Frequency of recurrent AOM In one trial including 4968 healthy infants aged from 6 weeks t o 5 months, PHiD-CV11 was associated with a non-signicant 56% (95% CI per-protocol analysis ( Prymula 2006 ). The evidence for this outcome was of moderate quality; the evi- dence quality was downgraded one level due to the imprecise eff ect estimate. Effect of PCV administered at a later age (one year and above) In three trials, various types of PCV7 were administered in ch ildren with a history of either RTI (597 participants), Jansen 2008 , or AOM (457 participants in total) ( van Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ). 18 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.CRM197-PCV7 Primary outcome Frequency of all-cause AOM episodes In two trials (457 children) ( van Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ), CRM197-PCV7 followed by PPV23 in children aged from one to seven years with a history of AOM was not associated with furth er reductions in AOM (1 Kempen 2006 )). In one trial including 597 children with a history of RTI ( Jansen 2008 ), CRM197-PCV7 administered together with a trivalent influenza vaccine (CRM197-PCV7/TIV) associated a to in compared to hepatitis B/placebo vaccination in per-protocol analysis. Ho w- ever, the effect of TIV/placebo compared to hepatitis B/placebo vaccination on all-cause AOM episodes appeared to be (RRR CI 30% to 88%) ( Jansen 2008 ). The evidence for this outcome was of high quality. Secondary outcomes Frequency of pneumococcal AOM In per-protocol analysis of one trial including 383 children wit h a history of AOM ( Veenhoven 2003 ), CRM197-PCV7 followed by PPV23 non-signicant 34% (P = 0.22) RRR in pneumococcal AOM episodes.

The evidence for this outcome was of moderate quality; the ev- idence quality was downgraded one level due to imprecise effect estimates (one study with a relatively small sample size). Frequency of recurrent AOM None of the three trials in older children reported the effect o f PCV7 on recurrent AOM.CRM197-PCV9 In one trial (264 children) ( Dagan 2001 ), CRM197-PCV9 was administered in healthy day-care attendees aged from 12 to 35 months. Primary outcome Frequency of all-cause AOM episodes In a per-protocol analysis, CRM197-PCV9 was ( Dagan 2001 ). The evidence for this outcome was of low quality; the evidence quality was downgraded two levels due to study limitations (r isk of bias and questions about outcome assessment) and imprecise effect estimate (one study with a relatively small sample size ). Secondary outcomes Dagan 2001 did not report on any of our secondary outcomes of interest. D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results The current evidence base for the effects of PCVs for preventing AOM in children comes from 11 RCTs (60,733 children) of 7- to 11-valent PCVs versus control vaccines (meningococcus type C conjugate vaccine in three trials, and hepatitis A or B vaccine in eight trials) with a generally low risk of bias. No relevant R CTs with the newer 13-valent PCV were available. In seven trials (59,41 5 children), PCVs were predominantly administered in children' s rst months of life, whilst four trials (1318 children) include d children aged one year and over who were either healthy or who had a history of respiratory illness or frequent AOM. There w as considerable clinical heterogeneity across studies in terms of de- sign, study population, type of PCV used, and outcome measure s, therefore we did not perform meta-analyses. The licenced CRM197-PCV7 and PHiD-CV10 vaccines, when administered during early infancy (< 6 months of age), were asso - ciated with substantial RRR in pneumococcal AOM (high-qual- ity evidence). However, their effects on all-cause AOM are far more uncertain, as most trials failed to demonstrate statist ical signicant differences for this outcome. Relative risk reducti ons for CRM197-PCV7 varied from 5% (95% CI 25% 12%) 19 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.(high-quality evidence); whereas RRRs 28%) in healthy infants (moderate-quality evidence). Administration of PCVs in high-risk infants, after early inf ancy, and in older children with a history of a history of respirator y illness or frequent AOM was not associated with reductions in a ll- cause AOM. Local redness, swelling, fever, and tenderness/pain were com monly reported and occurred more frequently in children receiving PCV than in those receiving control vaccines, but these adverse effe cts were mostly mild. More severe redness (> 2.5 cm), swelling (> 2.5 cm), and fever (> 39 \u00b0C) occurred far less frequently and did not differ between vaccine groups. Serious adverse events jud ged causally related to vaccination were rare and did not differ sig - nicantly between vaccine groups. No fatal SAE judged causally related to vaccination was reported. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence The 11 RCTs included in this review differed substantially in terms of RCT type, study population (age of PCV administratio n and AOM baseline risk), PCV type (vaccine valency, carrier pro- tein, and booster regimen), co-administration of other vaccines , and AOM assessment and denition used. Furthermore, in the infant studies focusing on AOM ( 2014 ), the control groups varied markedly in the proportions of S pneumoniae ,H influenzae , and M catarrhalis found in the middle ear fluid. This might be related to time and geographic region as well as case denition, and ha s important implications for the effects of PCV on preventing al l- cause AOM episodes. Additionally, three studies included old er otitis-prone children, so the intervention was aimed at second ary or even tertiary prevention, and not primary prevention ( Jansen 2008 ;van Kempen 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ). The reduced efcacy of CRM197-PCV7 in children with a history of AOM may be explained by an increased susceptibility to subsequent infect ions, not only with non-vaccine-type pneumococci, but also other na- sopharyngeal colonisers, due to 'damage' already suffered b y the middle ear mucosa caused by prior AOM ( Veenhoven 2003 ). An- other explanation, although debated, could be the non-protec- tive, impaired antibody responses of children who are otitis -prone (Pichichero 2013 ;Wiertsema 2012 ). It thus appears that the age at which PCV is administered, a history of AOM episodes, or both, modies the effect of PCV on AOM, despite the fact that age alone could not be identied as a statistically signicant e /Fireman 2003; Veenhoven 2003 ). Our re- view did not focus on the effects of PCVs on shifts in serotypes over time. Further research into the impact of PCVs on (serotype ) replacement is warranted since a shift in causative pathogens m ay have considerable implications on both AOM burden and vaccine effectiveness .Quality of the evidence We judged the methodological quality of the included studies t o be generally high. For most outcomes, the quality of the evide nce varied from high (further research is very unlikely to change ou r condence in the estimate of effect) to moderate (further resear ch is likely to have an important impact on our condence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate). The evidence for the effect of CRM197-PCV9 administered in healthy day-care attendees aged 12 to 35 months on all-cause AOM episodes was of low quality (further research is very likely to have an impor tant impact on our condence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate). Potential biases in the review process We adhered to the prespecied review protocol. In this 2019 up- date, two review authors (ACF and RPV) independently searched all relevant electronic databases using a search syntax compri sing all relevant synonyms for PCV and AOM. We also performed a broad internet search to identify potentially relevant arti cles. T o increase the yield of relevant studies, we reviewed the refer ence lists of all identied studies and systematic reviews or met a-anal- yses. We searched ClinicalT rials.gov and the WHO ICTRP for completed and ongoing trials. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews Our main ndings are in agreement with two other systematic reviews on the effect of PCV in children, indicating that PCVs provide substantial protection against pneumococcal AOM, but that their effects on all-cause AOM are more uncertain and far les s pronounced ( Ewald 2016 ;Pavia 2009 ;Taylor 2012 ). In AOM, there is a high potential for replacement by other bac- terial pathogens that are common colonisers of the nasopharyn x. CRM197-PCV7 is known to affect nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci, with a shift from vaccine-type pneumococci aureus (Biesbroek 2014 Block 2006 ;Casey 2013 ;Coker ;Eskola ;Obaro ;van Gils 2011 ;Wiertsema 2011 ). Nasopharyngeal carriage results from a recent RCT on PHiD-CV10 showed simi- lar bacterial colonisation patterns as observed in CRM197-PCV 7 among healthy Dutch children aged up to two years ( van den Bergh 2013 ). The middle ear is directly connected to the nasophar- ynx, and by lowering the carriage of vaccine-type pneumococci, a niche may be created for other bacteria with pathogenic potenti al (Block 2006 ;Veenhoven 2003 ;Veenhoven 2004 ). Recent studies have shown that nationwide implementation of PCVs may have changed the frequency of the causative otopathogens involved i n 20 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.AOM towards pneumococcal serotypes not included in vac- cines 2011 ;Wiertsema 2011 ). RCT data to demonstrate a convincing bene- cial effect of CRM197-PCV7 and PHiD-CV10 on all-cause AOM, various global postmarketing studies with these licence d vaccines, as well as the newer CRM197-PCV13, suggest that the impact of PCVs on AOM may be substantial ( 2007 ;Sigur\u00f0sson 2018 ;Zhou 2008 ), which may be attributable to indirect (herd) effects of vaccinatio n. However, it should be noted that ndings from observational stud- ies warrant careful interpretation, as variability in basel ine inci- dence, study population, and case denition, as well as fluctuat ions in risk factors for AOM such as breastfeeding, household smoki ng, day-care attendance rates, and implementation of AOM clinical practice guidelines, may affect the AOM incidences reported. For example, results from Boston (USA) showed that the decline in uncomplicated AOM, treatment failure, and AOM relapse was at least as large in the 2000 to 2004 period compared to the 1996 to 2000 period, leaving the 'true' contribution of PCV in reducin g AOM incidence uncertain ( Sox 2008 ). Furthermore, reduced ex- posure to household smoking, among other factors such as PCV7 coverage since 2002, may have contributed to the steady decline in USA paediatric ambulatory visits for OM over the period of 1993 to 2006 ( Alpert 2011 ). The impact of PHiD-CVs may expand beyond their effects on pneumococcal AOM to AOM caused by non-typeable H influen- the carrier protein D ( Forsgren 2008 ). A recent re- view including pre-clinical, clinical, and postmarketing studie s concluded that PHiD-CVs AOM caused by non- typeable H influenzae , but that more evidence including specic outcomes is clearly warranted ( Clarke 2017 ). The diversity of non-typeable H influenzae , with some strains lacking protein D, may limit the effect of PHiD-CVs on non-typeable H influenzae AOM. In our review, administration of the licenced PHiD-CV10 in healthy infants was associated AOM. licenced CRM197-PCV7 on all-cause AOM therefore remains uncertain. We found limited evidence that administration of PCVs during infancy may reduce the risk of recurrent AOM. This is in line with accumulating evidence that PCVs might disrupt the con- tinuum of evolution from pneumococcal-associated OM towards chronic/recurrent OM by prevention of early vaccine-serotype AOM, thereby reducing subsequent and more complex disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes and non-typeable H influenzae ndings are further sup- ported by secondary analyses of some of the trials included in our review indicating that licenced CRM197-PCV7 and PHiD- PCV10 lead to fewer ventilation ( Black 2000 ;Palmu 2015b ;Sarasoja 2013 ). A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice Current evidence from randomised controlled trials indicates that, albeit associated with large relative risk reductions in pneu mococ- cal acute otitis media (AOM), the effect of administration of the licenced CRM197-PCV7 and PHiD-CV10 in healthy, low-risk infants on AOM is uncertain and modest at best. However, globa l postmarketing studies of these vaccines, as well as the licenced CRM197-PCV13, suggest that the impact (i.e. both direct and indirect effects) of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) on AOM may be substantial. Furthermore, it should be noted that the decision whether or not to implement PCV should not come from just AOM studies, but also from studies that see and show the big picture, including data on invasive pneumococcal disease such as pneumonia, bacteraemia, and meningitis. Compared to control vaccines, PCVs were associated with an in- crease in mild local reactions (redness, swelling), fever, and pa in/ tenderness. However, we found no evidence of a difference in (fa r less frequently occurring) more severe local reactions, fever, or se- rious adverse events judged to be causally related to vaccinati on. Implications for research Since most countries across the world have implemented PCV in nationwide immunisation programmes, future randomised con - trolled trials comparing PCVs versus control vaccines are unlik ely to be performed. Whilst there is some observational evidence o f a difference in effects on AOM between PHiD-CV10 and the newer CRM197-PCV13 ( Gisselsson-Solen 2017 ), future trials may compare of various types of PCVs. More impor- tantly, future research will likely shed a light on the effects of other vaccines to prevent AOM, including (protein-based) vaccines di- rected at Streptococcus in AOM will continue or wane over time due to replacement is relevant and deserves ongoing monitor- ing. Besides a reduction of nasopharyngeal vaccine-type seroty pes, which is presumed to induce herd effects, replacing pneumococcal serotypes may not only lead to replacement disease in vaccines, but also in the population. Continuing surveillance of nasop ha- ryngeal carriage and pneumococcal disease in both the short and long term ( Spijkerman 2012 ), in different settings and geographic locations, is therefore of utmost importance. 21 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

In half of the study clinics, the carrier pr otein in the DTP andHaemophilus influenzae vaccine was CRM197, and in the other half it was tetanus toxoid. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine was given at 7 months of age and again at the same time as the fourth dose of the study vaccine at 12 months of a ge. Measles-mumps- rubella vaccine was administered at 18 months Outcomes Primary outcome : number of AOM episodes due to the pneumococcal serotypes in- cluded in the vaccine Secondary outcomes all-cause AOM episodes, culture-conrmed ber of children with recurrent AOM episodes (dened as 3 or more A OM episodes in the last 6 months or 4 or more in the last 12 months); serious adv erse events, safety (pain, local and systemic reactions within 3 days after vaccinati on, unexpected events after vaccination and mortality) All children attended 1 of the study clinics for enrolment at 2 mo nths of age and thereafter at 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, and 24 months. Parents were encouraged to bring their child to the study clinic for evaluation of symptoms suggesting respi ratory infection or AOM. AOM was diagnosed by otoscopy (visibly abnormal tympanic memb rane in terms of colour, position, or mobility, suggesting middle ear effusi on) and the presence of at least 1 of the following symptoms or signs of acute infection: f ever, earache, irritability, diarrhoea, vomiting, acute otorrhoea not caused by otitis ext erna, and other symptoms of respiratory infection. For the overall and pathogen-specic AOM episodes, a new episo de was considered to have started if at least 30 days had elapsed since the beginnin g of the previous episode. For AOM episodes according to serotype, a new episode was consid ered to have started if 30 days had elapsed since the beginning of an episode due to t he same serotype, or if any interval had elapsed since the beginning of an episode due to a different serotype. If more than 1 serotype was recovered from the middle ear fluid at t he same time, only 1 episode was considered to have started Funding sources Supported by Merck, Pasteur M\u00e9rieux Connaught, and Wyeth-Led erle Vaccines and Pediatrics Declarations of interest Dr Eskola and Dr Kilpi have served as consultants to Wyeth-Lede rle Vaccines Notes Participants lost to follow-up :total: 82/1662 (4.9%) did not complete the follow-up period in the protocol Participants lost to follow-up :Tx:45/831 (5.4%) did not complete the follow-up period specied in the protocol Participants lost to follow-up :C:37/831 (4.5%) did not complete the follow-up period specied in the protocol Risk of bias Bias Authors' judgement Support for judgement 32 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing acute otit is media in children (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

However, because of a lower-than-ex pected AOM rate, the surveillance was enhanced in July 2009 (2 years after start o f enrolment) through regular telephone calls or home visits by study personnel who advised parents to visit the clinic if their child had symptoms suggestive of AOM.

However, the effects of these vaccines on all-cause AOM is far more uncertain. We found no evidence of a benecial effect on all-cause AOM of administering pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in high-risk infants, after early infancy (i.e. in children aged one year and above) and in older children with a history of respiratory illness. Compared to control vaccines, PCVs were associated with an increase in mild local reactions (redness, swelling), fever, and pain/ tenderness, but we found no evidence of a difference in more severe local reactions, fever, or serious adverse events judged to be causally related to vaccination 29 March 2019 New search has been performed We updated the searches and included three new pub- lications: two new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (T regnaghi one new trial publi- cation (S\u00e1ez-Llorens 2017), which reported outcome data relevant for this review as part of a secondary analysis of T regnaghi 2014 .

H I S T O R Y Protocol rst published: Issue 2, 1999 Review rst published: Issue 2, 2002 Date Event Description 21 February 2014 New search has been performed With this update, more precise information on the ef- fect of PCV7 for the prevention of otitis media has be- come available. We judged the quality of the evidence for PCV7 in both early infancy and older children to be high, with further research very unlikely to change our condence in the estimate of effect Based on current evidence of the effects of pneumo- coccal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) licenced 7-valent PCV has modest benecial effects in healthy infants with a low baseline risk of AOM. Administering PCV7 in high- risk infants, after early infancy, and in older children with a history of AOM appears to have no benet in preventing further episodes Several randomised controlled trials dif- ferent (newly licensed, multivalent) PCVs adminis- tered during early infancy to establish their effects on AOM are currently ongoing. The results of these stud- ies may provide a better understanding of the role of the newly licenced, multivalent PCVs in preventing AOM. Also, the impact of the carrier protein D, as used in certain pneumococcal vaccines for AOM, needs to be further established 3 December 2013 New search has been performed Three new review authors joined the team to update this review The updated search (November 2007 to December 2013) retrieved 171 records.

Published by J ohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.External sources No sources of support supplied D I F F E R E N C E S B E T W E E N P R O T O C O L A N D R E V I E W Following feedback from a peer reviewer and editorial advice, we changed the title of this 2019 update to include the populati on (children). We also added 'adverse effects' as the co-primary outco me. We created a 'Summary of ndings' table for PCVs administe red in early infancy using the following outcomes: frequency of all -cause AOM episodes (co-primary outcome), adverse effects (co-primary outcome), frequency of pneumococcal AOM, and frequency of recurrent AOM (dened as three or more AOM episodes in six months or four or more in one year). Furthermore, we used the ve GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, impr ecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the quality of a body of evidence as it relates to the studies that contribute da ta to the prespecied outcomes. This was not proposed in the protocol. Al so, some (other) Cochrane methods have evolved over time. The revised methods have been applied in the 2019 update where re quired. N O T E S The focus in research has shifted from the use of pneumococcal poly saccharide vaccines (PPVs) to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in children, and the role of PPVs in the prevention of AOM in children is not relevant anymore as PPVs are no longer used a s primary intervention in children since the introduction of PCV s. The focus of the current review has therefore shifted from th e effect of PPVs to the effect of PCVs on acute otitis media. No further at tention will be paid to the effects of PPVs, which were described in prior versions of this review ( Straetemans 2003 ).
