Silbermann Foundation (photo taken before the COVID-19 pandemic) RWJBarnabas Health, the largest academic health care system in New Jersey, has received a $100,000 grant in support of its COVID vaccination efforts from the Rosanne H. Silbermann Foundation, a private family foundation established in honor of Rosanne H. Silbermann (1924-2009) and maintained in her memory. \"RWJBarnabas Health is extremely grateful to the Rosanne H. Silbermann Foundation for their generous support of our efforts to provide life-saving vaccines to as many people as possible throughout the state of New Jersey,\" said Barry H. Ostrowsky, President and Chief Executive Officer of RWJBarnabas Health. \"We are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel from this devastating pandemic and look ahead to moving forward together.\" The funds are primarily being used for the transportation of individuals to receive the vaccine, the creation of efficient COVID clinic operations and the infrastructure supporting these efforts. \"Nothing exemplifies the Foundation's mission more than being able to help the community in which we live to begin to overcome this unprecedented COVID pandemic,\" said Steven and Julie Silbermann, who are residents of Livingston, NJ. RWJBarnabas Health educates the community on the safety, efficacy and importance of COVID vaccines and administers vaccines on several fronts. As a leader in the delivery of quality and efficient health care, the system was chosen by the State of New Jersey to lead one of the state's six vaccine mega-sites\u2014the Middlesex County Regional COVID-19 Vaccine Mega-site at the New Jersey Convention & Exposition Center in Edison. Additionally, system facilities operate vaccine clinics in-house and support selected sites in several counties. The grant from the Silbermann Foundation helps support an uninterrupted flow of immunizations. The mission of the Rosanne H. Silbermann Foundation is to make a profound difference in medical, educational and religious organizations. Founded under the adage, \"When you can, you must,\" this tight-knit family honors the philosophy of community support that was deeply instilled by Rosanne and Joachim Silbermann.
