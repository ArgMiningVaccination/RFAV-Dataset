School of Spiritual Science The School of Spiritual Science, often referred to as the Class, is actively supported in New Zealand by the work of the class holders. The class holders meet on an annual basis and prepare the annual Class Conference. Financial support assists with the travel expenses for this meeting and the conference. Performing Arts in New Zealand Performances provide incentive for artists and finances support them in their work and preparation. For the most the work is given freely but travel quickly depletes the funds. In the past The Persephone Fund supported those working in the performing arts through Anthroposophy but this has now run dry. To sustain work in this area we need a fresh spring with sponsorship, patronage and financial support for the artistic endeavours in eurythmy, music, speech and drama. Tinder Box Gift Fund The purpose of this fund is to nurture new anthroposophically-inspired initiatives by providing 'tinder for a spark' that then kindles the fire of activity. By supporting people's travel costs we can support them in getting together and working on new initiatives. The Tinder Box Gift fund was founded from a generous bequest. We warmly invite you to consider this gift fund in your will. Crystal Bridge Loan Fund Crystal Bridge was founded in 1991 as an initiative to help students at Taruna College with their course fees, at a time when there was no possibility of government-sponsored student loans. The fund is open to all New Zealanders wishing to undertake study, locally or internationally, based on the work of Rudolf Steiner. Loans are interest-free and tailored to the individual borrower, but are usually repaid over 1-2 years. There is also a fund or gift money, the prerequisite for such a gift being that it benefits a group of people. Donations to the fund are gratefully received. For more "}
