Because of this, herbs can evoke a deep cleansing response. Understanding these responses are crucial. If we feel sick, have excess mucus, headaches, breakouts, and rashes during a cleanse, does that mean there is a problem? Or is that to be expected? In this class, we hope to empower you to cleanse and have confidence in the natural healing process your body is going through. Why Do We Need to Cleanse? We live in a toxic world, which means that everybody can improve their health. Most people were born with weak immune systems and congested organs. Our children probably need cleansing just as much as adults. Similar to how we change oil filters and air filters, everyone needs to cleanse. If you have an obvious health issue, cleansing can help. When we are sick, we often treat only the symptoms or do something to provide temporary relief. However, to heal the body and fix the problem that is causing the symptoms, we must cleanse the body and allow it to heal naturally. The root of most sickness and disease is congestion, inflammation, and toxicity in the body. The best way to address these issues is through cleansing the body. What Do We Cleanse? The common areas to cleanse in the body are the colon, kidneys, lymphatic system, and liver, ideally in that order. However, we often need to cleanse the body of infections, gallstones, heavy metals, chemicals, and other toxins. Don't let this stress you out. The body is smart. When you're cleansing, giving your digestion a break, and taking detoxing herbs, the body will target the areas where healing needs to occur. What Happens to The Body When Cleansing? \"The symptoms of sickness and disease are the same as the symptoms of healing; the difference is the elimination of toxins.\" When the body is sick or unhealthy, it is normal to experience symptoms such as cold/flu symptoms, cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, fatigue, headaches, loss of appetite, rashes, fever, muscle or body aches, mood swings, being highly emotional, etc. These can be the exact same symptoms as healing; in fact, they are expected. They can be a sign of a good cleanse and that progress is being made. Before cleansing, it is best to educate yourself or work with a professional. An herbal or cleansing reaction can be good, but it can also be bad or too much too fast. We do need to use caution and wisdom. How to Use Herbs to Cleanse & Restore Health 1. Start with nutrition. The best way to cleanse and allow the herbs to work for you is to eliminate all mucus-forming foods and foods that block the detoxification process. A short list of foods that prevent cleansing includes dairy, sugar, meat, nuts, seeds, all fats and oils, and processed grains. It is best to mostly eat fruits, veggies, and greens, and possibly some rice, oatmeal, quinoa, or other whole grains. Fasting is also an amazing tool to know! 2. Start with the colon and kidneys. The main elimination pathways must be open and functioning well to bring healing to the rest of the body. 3. Use a cleanse that is designed for you. Work with a professional to design a cleanse specifically for you or buy a [premade cleanse package](https://store.spiritofhealthkc.com/cleanse-packages/) from a reputable company or herbalist. 4. Start slow. Start with a small amount of one herb or formula and slowly increase the dosages. We don't need to be afraid (be wise, cautious, and go slowly) to increase the amounts of herbs to get the desired effect. Herbs work! Remember that God gave them to mankind to serve, help, and heal us! 5. Use herbs to support while cleansing. For example, use a good [herbal formula to support your adrenal glands](https://store.spiritofhealthkc.com/adrenal-boost-tea/) and hormones to give you better energy, stamina, and vitality during your cleanse. Use nutritive herbs such as [greens](https://store.spiritofhealthkc.com/chlorella-spirulina-greens/), seaweeds, or berries to provide vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients while you're cleansing.
