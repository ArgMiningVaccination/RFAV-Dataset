Year institution was established and its type (eg, private, public, land -grant, etc.) The University of Arizona was established in 1885 as a land -grant institution in Tucson, Arizona. The formation of the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health (MEZCOPH) itself was approved by the Arizona Board of Regents in January 2000 . b. Number of schools and colleges at the institution and the number of degrees offered by the institution at each level (bachelor's, master's, doctoral and professional preparation degrees ) Below are data about the number of colleges, schools and degrees offered by the University of Arizona: Colleges: 19 Schools: 22 Degrees Offered: Bachelors 130 Masters 143 Doctorate 93 Specialist 3 First Professional (Med, Law, Pharm) 3 Total 372 c. Number of university faculty, staff and students The most recent University of Arizona census provides the following information about the University's population. Faculty: 3,090 Staff: 9,598 Students: 44,831 d. Brief statement of distinguishing university facts and characteristics Established in 1885, the University of Arizona (UA), the state's only land -grant university with two medical schools, produces graduates who are real -world ready. Recognized as a global leader, the UA is also a leader in research, bringing more than $622 m illion in research investment each year, and ranking 22nd among all public universities. The UA is advancing the frontiers of interdisciplinary scholarship and entrepreneurial partnerships and is a member of the Association of American Universities, the 62 leading public and private research universities. It benefits the state with an estimated economic impact of $8.3 billion annually. e. Names of all accrediting bodies (other than CEPH) to which the institution responds. The list must include the regional ac creditor for the university as well as all specialized accreditors to which any school, college or other organizational unit at the university responds The University of Arizona is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). The HLC is one of six regional accreditation agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. The University's last comprehensive evaluation for re -accreditation occurred in 2010 and validated the University's extraordinary quality and integrity of academics, research, administration, faculty, staff, resources, facilities and procedures. A list of all other accreditations for the academic units at the University, programs, laboratories, research centers, departments and schools is available at https://catalog.arizona.edu/accreditation . 5 The University of Arizona has earned the designation of a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) from the U.S. Department of Education for its success in the enrollment of Hispanic students and in providing educational opportunities to them. The HSI designation opens new opportunities to boost supplemental grants and student suppo rt services, as well as additional benefits to the UA for research collaborations and partnerships. The UA joins 105 four -year public institutions and only a few from Research I and the Association of American Universities that meet the criteria for eligi bility for HSI designation, according to the most recent data from the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. The UA is the first of Arizona's three state universiti es to be so designated. Additionally, MEZCOPH is an active member of the Hispanic -Serving Health Professionals Schools. f. Brief history and evolution of the school of public health (SPH) and related organizational elements, if applicable (eg, date founded, educational focus, other degrees offered, rationale for offering public health education in unit, etc.) The Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health (MEZCOPH) originated as a program in public health within the Department of Family and Com munity Medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. The MPH program was initially accredited in 1994 and obtained full accreditation in 1997. The Arizona Prevention Center was approved in 1997 by the Arizona Board of Regents as a Class I Ce nter of Excellence and served as the primary predecessor to MEZCOPH. Faculty members of this center were the original core faculty of MEZCOPH. The Center still remains as an integral part of MEZCOPH and has been renamed the Canyon Ranch Center for Preven tion and Health Promotion. In January 2000, MEZCOPH was officially established by the Arizona Board of Regents and with the financial support from Mel and Enid Zuckerman, founders of Canyon Ranch Health Resorts, a building fund and endowments were created to provide the bricks and mortar for a building and to initiate the process of securing funds that were needed to create a college. In recognition of this support, on July 1, 2002 the College was officially named the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health and is referred to as MEZCOPH throughout this document. In 2003, MEZCOPH received its initial CEPH accreditation as a College and in 2005 and 201 3 the College was re - accredited for the maximum amount of seven years. In October 2014, MEZCOPH established a collaboration with Pearson Embanet to have them support the marketing, recruitment, student support and development of courses for our online MPH program. The contract established an initial 5 -year collaboration at which time it woul d be reviewed for its further continuation. This collaboration led to the implementation of the program with students being enrolled every semester for the past 4 years. However, since the implementation of this online program, the University of Arizona e stablished Arizona Online, an office that provides the same services as Pearson Embanet. Therefore, we are now in negotiation to terminate the contract with Pearson Embanet and move these services onto our own campus. This will allow our Office of Acade mic Affairs and Office of Student Services to have a closer tie to the delivery of these services with personnel being housed on campus. 6 2) Organizational charts that clearly depict the following related to the school: a. The school's internal organization, including the reporting lines to the dean* The organizational chart in Figure 1 provides the lines of communications that occur within MEZCOPH.

These students are then able to be linked to advisors in our Office of Student Services w ho support the development of their academic plans of study so they have information about the requirements for being accepted into public health major. A full description of this process is provided in Section 9. 11 A1. ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES 12 A1. ORGANIZATION and Administrative Processes The school demonstrates effective administrative processes that are sufficient to affirm its ability to fulfill its mission and goals and to conform to the conditions for accreditation. The school establishes appropriate decision -making structures for al l significant functions and designates appropriate committees or individuals for decision making and implementation. The school ensures that faculty (including full -time and part -time faculty) regularly interact with their colleagues and are engaged in wa ys that benefit the instructional school (eg, participating in instructional workshops, engaging in school -specific curriculum development and oversight). 1) List the school's standing and significant ad hoc committees. For each, indicate the formula for mem bership (eg, two appointed faculty members from each concentration) and list the current members. MEZCOPH has 14 college -level standing committees. These are : 1) Executive Council, 2) Dean's Council, 3) Promotion and Tenure Committee, 4) E ducation Commit tee, 5 ) Student Scholarships and Financial Aid, 6) Research Advisory Committee, 7) Community Engagement, Practice and Service Committee, 8) Student Affairs Committee, 9) MEZCOPH Staff Forum (proposed with reorganization) , 10) Faculty Assembly, 11) Committee on Inclusion and Equity , 12) Environment Committee, 13) Evaluation Committee, and 14) Community Advisory Board. The College's structure has allowed it to be responsive to the changing landscape of higher education and to make changes to improv e its. Examples include having college -wide votes to change the bylaws, the establishment of departments from divisions, updated promotion and tenure guidelines for tenure and career track faculty, the creation of a College Environment Committee that promo ted and helped create a lactation room and water bottle filling station, an active Committee on Inclusion and Equity and student representation on committees. A list of the College's standing and significant ad hoc committees is provided in Table A1. This includes the name of the committees, their charge, the formula used to determine their composition and the current members. Table A1.

Briefly describe which committee(s) or other responsible parties make decisions on each of the following areas and how the decisions are made : a. degree requirements The Education Committee is the overarching group that determines degree requirements and approval for degree requirements, and are based on a majority vote. The UA G raduate College requires the same number of credits for all the MPH concentrations as they are all part of a single degree program. Departments initiate degree programs and are approved by the Education Committee. Additionally, new degrees need to be approved by s everal university committees and the Arizona Board of Regents. 20 b. curriculum design The Education Committee is the overarching group that determines how the curricula are designed. An undergraduate sub -committee of the Education Committee makes recommen dations for any changes to the college -wide undergraduate curricula. Departments initiate how curricula are designed for MPH concentrations and academic degrees. All new curricula and changes to curricula designs are reviewed by the Education Committee an d approved when they impact the required MPH courses and other degree programs. The Education Committee requires a majority vote to approve new and significantly modified curricula designs. Changes to required courses also need to be approved by several u niversity committees. c. student assessment policies and processes The Education Committee sets standards for assessing student progress in courses. This is done at the time when any new course is presented to the committee by reviewing the syllabus and en suring that there is a clear method for student assessment. The Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs works with the Education Committee to determine the processes to assess progress toward graduation and the processes to deliver the curricula. d. admissions policies and/or decisions The Education Committee determines admissions policies for the undergraduate and graduate programs, and must follow University and Graduate College policies. The Education Committee sets the admissions criteria for th e undergraduate major. Academic advisors in the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs review all applications to the major and make admissions decisions based on whether applicants meet the minimum admissions standards. If an applicant has unusual or questionable circumstances, the Undergraduate Sub -Committee of the Education Committee is consulted. Official admissions for all graduate programs occur through the UA Graduate College. Each program sets admissions criteria for their MS, PhD, and DrPH programs, and the Education Committee sets admissions criteria for the MPH program. MEZCOPH Department -level admissions committees make recommendations to the Graduate College, and the Graduate College confirms that the applicant has a bachelor's degree (or master's degree if this is required) from a 4 -year, accredited institution with a 3.0 GPA, as well as any r equired English proficiency exams for international applicants. The Environmental Health Sciences Department has also developed an accelerated five-year Bachelor of Science to Master of Public Health degree option for exceptional students. The combined, structured degree enables students to replace elementary level courses in the bachelor program with deeper expertise provided in the master level coursework. Students must apply for entry , and admission to the program is highly competitive, requiring a 3.3 GPA and additional math and science coursework (calculus, physics, and organic chemistry). Students begin the MPH curriculum their senior year as an undergraduate, and 12 units of graduate coursework is double - counted towards the BS degree and MPH degree. Since the program began in 2014, five students have completed the accelerated BS to MPH. Each program handles admissions decisions differently. For all MS, PhD, and DrPH programs, at least two faculty members review each application, and make a recommen dation to admit, interview, or deny to the program's admissions committee. Some doctoral programs interview top applicants before an admissions decision is made. The admissions committee, led by the Program Director, makes the final admissions decision . In the MPH program, six programs --Biostatistics, Epidemiology Environmental Health Sciences, Health Services Administration, One Health, and Public Health Practice --have two faculty members review each application and make a recommendation to their program's admissions committee. Three other programs \u2014Family and Child Health, Health Behavior Health Promotion, and Public Health Policy and Management \u2014ask the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs to conduct a first review of each application, and make a r ecommendation to admit, deny, or discuss. In this case, notes regarding the applicant's qualifications and any red flags 21 are reviewed with the Program Director and/or a small committee. Faculty members make the final admissions decisions on all application s. Dual degree applicants must apply to both the MPH program via SOPHAS and their other program of choice, and must be admitted to both programs separately. The MPH program accepts the test scores from the other program (e.g., LSAT for the JD/MPH, GMAT for the MBA/MPH, and the PCAT for the PharmD/MPH). For the online MPH program, the faculty have given Pearson a set of admissions criteria and minimum standards. The Associate Director of Recruitment Services for Pearson reviews all applications. If an applicant meets the minimum qualifications and does not have any red flags, they are recommended for admission. If an applicant does not meet minimum qualifications and/or has red flags, the application is sent to the Program Director f or an admissions decision. All applications are reviewed by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs before a recommendation to admit is submitted to the Graduate College. e. faculty recruitment and promotion Faculty recruitment is initiated by Departments when funds are available for a position. Departments develop a search committee and work with the College's Office of Human Resources and the Committee on Inclusion and Equity to develop an appropriate position announcement and recruitment stra tegy. Faculty promotion follows university policies and practices and begins with a department P&T committee that review s promotion dossiers and then is reviewed by the College P&T Committee with recommendations being made to the Dean. Dossiers are then forwarded to the University P&T Committee who makes a recommendation to the Provost . The Provost and the Senior Vice President for Health Sciences make the final determination . f. research and service activities The College's research advisory committee makes decisions regarding research goals and objectives.

Briefly describe how faculty contribute to decision -making activities in the broader institutional setting, including a sample of faculty memberships and/or leadership positions on committees external to the unit of accreditation . MEZCOPH faculty participate on several university -level standing committees and on college -level and health sciences center ad -hoc committees. At the University level, MEZCOPH faculty serve on the faculty senate, the undergraduate and graduate curriculum committees, the University P&T committee, the College Academic Administrators Council. MEZCOPH facult y have been members of several search committees for senior level administrators. A MEZCOPH faculty member , Dr. Daniel Derksen, is currently the University of Health Sciences Associate Vice President for Health Equity, Outreach and Interprofessional Activities. Table A2 provides additional s pecific examples for how MEZCOPH faculty participate with university activities : Table A2 MEZCOPH Faculty's University Activities - Examples University Activities and Committees MEZCOPH Faculty and Roles University Faculty Senate Melanie Bell and Joe Gerald, elected members University's Committee for Global Locations Iman Hakim, Member Internationalization Subcommittee: Global Research, Contracts and Projects (2018 ) Iman Hakim, Co -Chair Health Sciences Center Strategic Plan Jeff Burgess, Lead, Strategy Implementation Group Daniel Derksen , Lead, Interprofessional Education Portfolio, Heather Carter, Lead, Minimize the Debt Burden Douglas Taren, co -Lead, UAHS Global Kelly Reynolds: Co-Lead One Health Search Committee for Dean, College of Nursing Jeff Burgess, Co-chair Search Committee for University Provost John Ehiri, member Search Committee for Sr. VP Global Initiatives John Ehiri, member Search Committee for VP Finances Daniel Derksen, Co-chair Search Committee for Dean, College of Medicine Daniel Derksen, member Search Committee for Dean, Veterinary Schools Iman Hakim, member Search Committee for Sr. VP for Health Sciences Iman Hakim, co -chair Undergraduate Council Leslie Dennis, member College of Academic Administrators Council Chris Tisch, member Douglas Taren, member Academic Program Review, College of Law Douglas Taren, member Academic Program Review, Dept. of Surgery Douglas Taren, member Academic Program Review, College of Medicine, Phoenix Cecilia Rosales, member Faculty Senate Melanie Bell , member University Promotion and Tenure Denise Roe , member University Accreditation Committee Joe Gerald , member 4. Describe how full -time and part -time faculty regularly interact with their colleagues (self -study document) and provide documentation of recent interactions, which may include minutes, attendee lists, etc. MEZCOPH has two college -wide retreats each year at the end of the fall and spring semesters. These retreats are open to all full -time and part -time fa culty. The faculty assembly meets at least 4 times a year. Department meetings are another method that allows faculty to interact with each other. We also have a faculty listserv that allows faculty members to post questions. Faculty are also able to attend our college - wide seminar series, convocations, and social events. The Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics holds regular faculty meetings on the first Friday of each month during the spring and fall semesters. The an nual department retreat is organized for 23 discussions on specific topics of education, research, service , and department operation. There are 4 -5 department -wide seminar s each year for scholarly exchanges. There are standing committees and work groups in the department, including : promotion and tenure committee, teaching evaluation committee, peer review committee, joint and adjunct faculty work grou p, website work group, inclusion and diversity work group, and training grant work group . Adjunct and joint faculty are invited to join the department activities, including seminars and 1 -2 department meetings each year. The Department of Community, Environment and Policy has full -time and part -time faculty regularly interact with each other at monthly meetings, college and program seminars, and website development . There are collaborative efforts between all faculty and this includes its annual welcome back student social gathering, lab meetings, and after hour events. The Department of Health Promotion Sciences holds regular meetings that include all level of faculty members. The Department has semi -annual social events for all faculty, staff and students. Department meeting minutes and attendees list are kept in an HPS Box folder \"HPS DEPT MEETINGS ,\" which is available to all faculty and staff. All faculty are able to work on Department level initiatives and have been clo sely involved with the development and implementation of the DrPH program. The Division of Public Health Practice and Translational Research invites all faculty (fulltime or less than fulltime), including adjunct, lecturers, co -instructors, staff, etc. t o monthly division meetings, seminars, internship conferences, division team building sessions, etc. Its monthly meetings are held on the first Friday of the month from 10 -11am. It keeps meetings an hour in order to increase participation. At times, it h olds a monthly division meeting off campus at the end of day (4 -5pm) and have a social hour with food and drink to facilitate and encourage networking among our division faculty, staff and adjunct faculty members . For example, just recently (two months ag o), the division meeting was held off campus from 4 -5pm and after 5pm had dinner catered as a way of thanking and recognizing everyone's efforts and dedication to our students ' learning and contributions to the teaching, research and service mission of the college. Most of the adjunct faculty , lecturers, and co-instructors (online or in -class) have their own full-time jobs, but make every effort to attend the invitations to participate. Also, most adjunct faculty, lecturers, and co -instructors are off campus. The Division polls its faculty and staff every semester to adjust timing of division meetings, again to maximize participation by faculty, staff, co -instructors, and adjuncts. The Division keeps monthly notes of its division meetings that are in a shared file and lists who was present and absent and what was discussed, on a monthly basis. The Division also accommodates adjunct positions with opportunitie s that may arise for research or service contracts. For example, Dr. John Molina requested routing a sub award for a NIH grant submission by Harvard colleague through the division. He was assisted by Pre -Award staff to complete the documentation. Dr. Doug Campos -Outcalt recently tried to secure a contract from CDC and also requested routing through the Division. Maryell Martinez as the division administrative support staff lends support to all faculty regardless of their classification. Her activities incl ude ordering books, supplies for staff programs and has assisted faculty with updating their syllabi. The ERF A1.1 has examples of the minutes, attendee lists, etc. that demonstrates these activities. They include minutes from the following committees and meetings: CEPAS, Collegewide retreats, Dean's Council, Dean's updates, Community Advisory Board, Department meetings, Education Committee, Evaluation Committee, Executive Council, Faculty Assembly , Environment Committee, and the Self -Study Committee. 5.

Multi -Partner Schools (Applicable ONLY if functioning as a \"collaborative unit\" as defined in CEPH procedures) Not Applicable 26 A3. STUDENT ENGAGEMENT 27 A3. Student Engagement Students have formal methods to participate in policy making and decision making within the school, and the school engages students as members on decision -making bodies whenever appropriate. 1) Describe student participation in policy making and decision making at the school level, including identification of all student members of school c ommittees over the last three years, and student organizations involved in school governance. Schools should focus this discussion on students in public health degree programs. Undergraduate, master and doctoral level students have been and are currently members of numerous committees in the college that have policy and decision -making authority. The list of students on committees for the past three years are in Table A3. Throug h their committee participation students vote on a variety of issues. Students tend to be most influential on the student affairs committee, education committee, committee on inclusion and equity, and our college's environment committe e. Additionally, th rough these committee students are able to bring issues to the college's Dean's Council. One example is that student representatives from student affairs addressed the need for a workshop on power and privilege dynamics within academic institutions which resulted in having it incorporated into a college -wide retreat. Another example of how student input has affected the college is that the student representation on our Education Committee was increased to 4 students (representing each degree level: undergraduate, master and doctoral and an online student ) compared with one vote previously. Students also take the lead on our semi -annual internship conference and our annual social justice conference to deter mine conference themes and invited speakers. Additionally, undergraduate and graduate student ambassadors play a significant role on determining how resources are directed toward recruitment. Student representatives are also present and attend our Execut ive Council meetings. Students are also included in department faculty searches. They are members of search committees and all students are able to provide evaluations of presentations by candidates for faculty positions. Students are consulted and provi ded input whenever we create a new degree program or there is a proposal to develop specific program fees. Student input is provided via surveys and focus groups. Finally, every course in the college conducts a Teaching and Course Evaluation (TCE). These student evaluations are made public. Students also provide input to our college's evaluation by participating in an exit survey and in alumni surveys. We are fortunate to have a strong Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs that works with the stude nts and gets feedback via various online surveys and focus groups. Students also are able to provide input directly to advisors and to our Assistant Dean. Although, it is difficult to get online students involved, we do invite them to be committee members (one has even been on our self -study team). Student organizations do play an important role in the college and can help provide a single voice to the faculty and administration on a variety of issues. The Public Health Student Alliance provides input for identifying students to be on college -wide committees, e .g. our evaluation committee and the environment committee. Table A3.

Not Applicable 30 A4. AUTONOMY FOR SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH 31 A4. Autonomy for Schools of Public Health A school of public health operates at the highest level of organizational status and independence available within the university context. If there are other professional schools in the same university (eg, medicine, nursing, law, etc.), the school of public health shall have the same degree of independence accorded to those professional schools. Independence and status are viewed within the context of institutional policies, procedures and practices. 1) Briefly describe the school's reporting lines up to the institution's chief executive officer. The response may refer to the organizational chart provided in the introduction. The lines of accountability and access to higher -level University officials for MEZCOPH are identical to all other colleges within the University. (Please see UA org anizational chart in ERFA4 ) The Dean of the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health is its chief academic and administrative officer. She is responsible for all activities and operations of the college and is the lead representative of MEZCOPH in its interactions with the University community and with external constituents. As the academic leader, the dean is charged with the responsibility of maintaining academic standards in teaching, research, and other services performed by MEZCOPH faculty. Pri mary responsibilities of the Dean include: providing leadership to faculty in teaching, research and service; promoting excellence in academic and research programs; promoting diversity and setting standards for diversity; shaping the vision of the colleg e; implementing the college's strategic plan; providing leadership in resource acquisition, resource management; facilitating faculty and staff development; and creating a positive environment for learning and growth in the college. The Dean of MEZCOPH ha s all the authority and prerogatives accorded to all college deans at the University. She meets regularly with the Senior Vice President for Health Sciences and the other senior University administrators to discuss progress and issues at the College. As wi th other deans, she formally meets with the President of the University on an annual basis to discuss the state of the College. She sits on the University's Council of Deans, a body composed of the deans of all of the colleges within the University that is chaired by the University Provost and meets monthly during the academic year. She also sits on the UA Health Sciences Intercollegiate Leadership Council , which meets monthly with the University's Senior Vice President for Health Sciences to discuss all as pects of the UA Health Sciences. In addition, she meets monthly with the S enior Vice President for Health Sciences for regular update s and communication. In summary, the lines of accountability and access to higher -level University officials for the College are identical to all other colleges within the University. 2) Describe the reporting lines and levels of autonomy of other professional schools located in the same institution and identify any differences between the school of public health's reporting lines/level of autonomy and those of other units. The Senior Vice President for Health Sciences is responsible for the University of Arizona Health Sciences which is home for two UA College s of Medicine (Tucson and Phoenix), the UA College of Nursing; the UA College of Pharmacy (Tucson and Phoenix); and t he UA Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health (Tucson and Phoenix). The Senior Vice President for Health Sciences reports directly to the President as do the Provost and Vice Presidents. While the reporting lines for the Health Sciences do not go through the Provost's Office, the five Deans of the Health Sciences participate in the Provost's Deans' Council, which meets monthly. In summary, The UA Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health has the same status and level of autonomy and indepe ndence afforded to other professional and graduate colleges within the university and the health sciences . The Dean is an administrative equal among Deans at the University. We will continue to promote inter -professional and cross -college collaboration, to support the development of university centers of excellence, and to promote innovative translational research. 32 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area.

Please refer to Template Intro -1 MEZCOPH Degree Programs for the complete list of degrees. 2) An official catalog or bulletin that lists the degrees offered by the school. The MEZCOPH Curriculum Guides for 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 are the most current official academic catalogs that list and describe the degree s offered by the College. The 2019 -20 guide is located on the College's website at: https://publichealth.arizona.edu/graduate -students and is located in the ERF A5 and the 2020 -2021 Curriculum Guide is in ERF A5.1 . 35 B1. GUIDING STATEMENTS 36 B1. Guiding Statements The school defines a vision that describes how the community/world will be different if the school achieves its aims. The school defines a mission statement that identifies what the school will accomplish operationally in its instructional, community engagement and scholarly activi ties. The mission may also define the school's setting or community and priority population(s). The school defines goals that describe strategies to accomplish the defined mission. The school defines a statement of values that informs stakeholders about its core principles, beliefs and priorities. 1) A one - to three -page document that, at a minimum, presents the school's vision, mission, goals and values. MEZCOPH has a clearly stated mission, vision, values statement, and goals and objectives. The Colleg e's values, mission and vision are driving forces for how MEZCOPH directs its resources and delivers its academic programs, creates research focus areas and supports intramural and extramural training and service. The College's mission and goals and objec tives were initially developed by its Executive Council, reviewed and approved by the faculty, and implemented in November 2001. The current mission and goals and objectives were reviewed in 2006, 2009, and 2012. The mission and goals were then incorporat ed into the College's Strategic Plan for 2013 -2020 and aligned with the University's Strategic Plan at that time. The goals and objectives are reviewed and monitored on a semi -annual basis during college -wide meetings. The major administrative committees of the College - Dean's Council, Education Committee, Committee on Inclusion and Equity (CIE), Community Engagement, Practice and Service (CEPAS) Committee, and the Research Advisory Council (RAC) - are responsible for continually reviewing goals and objectives. These major committees have college -wide representation. When revisions in either the mission or the goals are recommended, those recommendations are placed before the faculty and other voting members of MEZCOPH for discussion, feedback and approval. Further, the mission, vision, goals and objectives are available to the University community, the College's constituents, and to the public, via the College's website, http://www.publichealth.arizona.edu/ . Additionally, they are made available to the public by highlighting them in the College's promotional and recruitment publications and in presentations made by administrative members of the College. Evaluation is a formal, ongoing activity at the Coll ege. This ongoing system provides a mechanism for evaluating performance towards achieving current goals and objectives, while at the same time allowing opportunities for exploring improvements and making necessary revisions of the goals and objectives. In addition, the College's strategic planning process provides further review and evaluation by the entire college on a semi -annual basis. In 2018, the mission was re -evaluated and expanded to state that we are also dedicated to promoting \"wellness.\" This term was in line with our focus on creating studies and research on how to prevent disease which is congruent with the World Health Organization def inition of health . The input we received from external constituents who identified that the College should a lso provide additional studies in areas related to mindfulness. In respon se to this identified gap, the C ollege has now develope d four new undergraduate courses in this area to develop a sub -plan on transformative wellness. Values: The Mel & Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health acts with respect and integrity to continuously advance health and well -being for all through knowledge, collaboration, empowerment, advocacy and sustainability. Our core values are: Fairness, Trust, Equity, Social Justic e, Excellence, Innovation, Commitment, Collegiality, Diversity, Open Communication, Participation, Consensus and Enhancement. We strive to foster an educational community that values innovation and excellence in teaching, creation and dissemination of know ledge, practice -based research and research -based practice to address the health needs and interests of individuals and communities. 37 Mission: The Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health is dedicated to promoting the health and wellness of indivi duals and communities in the southwest and globally with an emphasis on achieving health equity through excellence in education, research & service . Goals The College has divided its overall goals into the three traditional areas of academia for a land grant institution that provide the overall strategy that will allow us to meet our mission. They are Instruction, Research and Service. The goals and objectives related to teaching are: Recruit and Matriculate an Ethnically, Geographically, Socioeconomically and Academically Diverse and Qualified Student Body Educate individuals for successful public health professional, research and academic careers.

Template B2 -1.5 Master of Science Maximum Time to Graduate Starting cohort numbers does not include those who switched into another program within our college. See notes below MPH chart above for transfers between MS and MPH programs. 2014 -2015 - 1 student began in PhD and transferred to MS, counted in MS cohort. 2016 -2017 - 1 student began in PhD and transferred to MS, counted in MS cohort. Per the University of Arizona Graduate College, doctoral students have a maximum allowable time to graduation of five years from time of successful completion of comprehensive exam. The following table provides the graduation rates for these students. 47 Template B2 -1.6 DrPH Students Maximum Time to Graduate 48 Template B2 -1.7 PhD Students Maximum Time to Graduate 49 Additional graduation rate data are available in the ERF B2 and include MS and doctoral completion by entering cohort (7 years) and is also disaggregated by program and degree. 2) Data on doctoral student progression in the format of Template B2 -2. 50 3) Explain the data presented above, including identification of factors contributing to any rates that do not meet this criterion's expectations and plans to address these factors. All MPH, DrPH and PhD cohorts meet the minimum criterion expectations. Comp letion rates determined by the University of Arizona's Graduate College are six years maximum from first matriculation for master's level students and five years maximum from successful completion of comprehensive exam for doctoral level students. All coh orts of the MS degree meet the minimum criterion with the exception of the 2015 -16 cohort. With just five new MS students entering that year, the withdrawal of two students resulted in a 60% completion rate. One student left to pursue a PhD in Immunobiolog y, the other for personal reasons. We have a strong undergraduate completion rate. We record undergraduate graduation rates for those students who have declared public health as a major. This allows us to include students in our counts from the time when they start the program and not students who have just taken our classes and then declare a different major. This allows us to better monitor the success of students who specifically identified public health as their major. A strength of our doctoral programs is the flexibility that is provided by the University of Arizona Graduate College which allows doctoral students a 5-year clock to completion that starts after they pass their comprehensive exam. This allows part -time students more time to finish cou rses. The rational for this time period is that no matter when students take a comprehensive exam after their start of their course work that their knowledge about the topic is current. 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area.

Post -Graduation Outcomes The school collects and analyzes data on graduates' employment or enrollment in further education post -graduation, for each public health degree offered (eg, BS, MPH, MS, PhD, DrPH). The school achieves rates of 80% or greater employment or enrollment in further education within the defined time period for each degree. 1) Data on post -graduation outcomes (employment or enrollment in further education) for each degree.

Postgraduate outcomes for all five programs of the college are presented in Table B3 -1. Data is collected in a variety of ways including via a Graduate Information Sheet collected at the time of graduation, the Alumni Survey (See ERF B3 for Alumni Survey Q uestionnaire) completed during the first year following graduation, the University's Career Destination survey, exhaustive review of LinkedIn and Facebook profiles, Google searches and direct contact with alumni via email and telephone. Each MEZCOPH prog ram achieves and far exceeds the target rate of 80% of graduates who are either employed, enrolled in further studies or not seeking employment. Additionally, the college's Post - Graduate Outcome rates exceed the overall outcome rates of all reporting ASPPH schools and programs. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not Applicable. 55 B4. ALUMNI PERCEPTIONS OF CURRICULAR EFFECTIVENESS 56 B4. Alumni Perceptions of Curricular Effectiveness For each public health degree offered, the school collects information on alumni perceptions of their own success in achieving defined competencies and of their ability to apply these competencies in their post -graduation placements. The school defines qualitative and/or quantitative methods designed to maximize response rates and provide useful information. Data from recent graduates wi thin the last five years are typically most useful, as distal graduates may not have completed the curriculum that is currently offered. 1) Summarize the findings of alumni self -assessment of success in achieving competencies and ability to apply competencie s after graduation. Alumni are asked one -year after graduation how well their academic program prepared them for their current job duties. The overall encompassing question is directly related to the competencies that are included the academic program a nd the ones that are used in their position. The average scores indicate that students believe the they we well to very well prepared for their workforce. Table B1. Alumni Perceptions MEZCOPH alumni are asked to assess the degree to which they felt their academic program prepared them for their current job duties. Using a Likert Scale to rate alumni responses where the ratings of Poor = 1; Somewhat = 2; Well = 3; and Very Well = 4, average alumni responses indicate that they generally feel well to very well prepared for the jobs they have secured. Average 2015 -2016 Scores Average 2016 -2017 Scores Average (n=137) 3.13 (n=167) Upon graduation, students are asked to rate how well they believe that they have met their foundational and concentr ation competencies. Tables B2 -B4 provide the results for the BS, MPH and DrPH foundational competencies respectively . ERF B3.1 provides more detailed results regarding response and graduates' perceptions for each concentration competency. As a first analysis with the newest CEPH Foundational Competencies, these results provide a strong baseline. MEZCOPH now has a system in place that provides detailed information on each competency. Having trend data will be important. We can use the current data to have faculty provide emphasis in courses on specific competencies that students feel less competent. Given these results are an initial look without an established anchor, th ese results do indicate that a very hi gh percentage of students perceived that their education program had them meet or partially the foundational competencies for their degree and more importantly very few believed that they were not competent for a specific competency. It is likely that some felt more competent in some ar eas than in other areas which may have been influenced by their interest area. In regards to the more detailed information in ERF B3.1 , the validity of the data at this point for specif ic concentration competencies are limited due to small sample sizes. 57 Table B2 .

Alumni are sent the alumni survey by email at one -year post graduation, allowing time for graduates to obtain positions and settle into jobs and further training. The survey is conducted using Survey Monkey and consists of general questions related to empl oyment type, sector, salary information and debt level. Notices on LinkedIn and Facebook Alumni groups are employed. Non -responders are contacted again by appropriate advising and program faculty. Table B5 .

Complaints were received about the number of surveys they get from the University and College. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the response rate for the alumni survey of the BS graduates conducted by the UA S tudent Engagement and Career Development Center was more robust than the college's own s urvey results . This discovery has resulted in ongoing discussions with the Engagement and Career Development Center to either include the College's questions on the Uni versity survey or to include the University's question on the Colleges survey. We also recognize that the graduate level response had a decrease for the 2017 -18 graduates. We therefore have instituted additional ways to stay in contact with alumni through social media such as LinkedIn . 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not Applicable. 64 B5. DEFINING EVALUATION PRACTICES 65 B5. Defining Evaluation Practices The school defines appropriate evaluation methods and measures that allow the school to determine its effectiveness in advancing its mission and goals. The evaluation plan is ongoing, systematic and well-documented. The chosen evaluation methods and measures must track the school's progress in 1) advancing the field of public health (addressing instruction, scholarship and service) and 2) promoting student success. 1) Present an evaluation plan that, at a minimum, lists the scho ol's evaluation measures, methods and parties responsible for review. See Template B5 -1. MEZCOPH's ongoing evaluation plan ensures that objectives are continuously monitored and revised. This ongoing system provides a mechanism for evaluating performance towards achieving current objectives, while simultaneously allowing opportunities for exploring improvements to and making appropriate revisions of the objectives. MEZCOPH's Evaluation Comm ittee was established in fall of 2002 for the purpose of developing a college - wide evaluation plan a nd to write the Evaluation and Planning section of the original self-study. The roles of this committee are to: 1) Coor dinate MEZCOPH evaluation ac tivities, 2) Provide formal feedback to committees generating the goals and objectives to ensure that these goals and objectives provide valuable information, are measurable, and map to the College's mission and strategic plan, 3) Ensure that data are utilized to inform decision ma king and planning processes, 4) Encourage College-wide involve ment in evaluation activities, 5) Ensure that all information required for evaluation, planning and reporting is collected systematically, 6) Streamline MEZCOPH reporting activities where possib le, and 7) Ensure that appropriate and efficie nt data collections systems are in place throughout the Colleg e. At the core of the MEZCOPH evaluation plan are the college's objectives, expected outcomes ma pped to the objectives, and strategies to measure the achiev ement of the expected outcomes. In 2010, the Dean placed the MEZCOPH Evaluation Comm ittee under the supervisi on of the Office of the Associa te Dean for Re search. Currently, the Associa te Dean for Rese arch serves as Chair of this comm ittee. Members of the comm ittee include the Director of the Office of Information Technology, the Associa te and Assis tant Deans, and a representative from the Dean's Office. Sources of data availa ble to evaluate the college's goals and objectives include: Annual Performance Reviews completed by all MEZCOPH a ppointed personnel, which detail instructional, research and service activities of appointed personnel. Records related to all funding sources, financial and hiring activities - tracked and managed by the Office of Financial Affairs and Facilities Management. Records on student recruitment and admissio ns, progress toward degrees, internships, advising, exit surveys, and alumni activities tracked and managed by the Office of Student Servi ces and Alumni Affairs. Course evaluations and learning assessme nts. College comm ittee meeting minutes. Central to having an effective college evaluation process are data collection and data administrators. Data resulting from MEZCOPH measurement strategies listed above are continually collected through a variety of methods throughout the year. MEZCOPH a dministrators are assig ned areas of data reporting responsibility. The responsible administrator and relevant committee (if applicable) record and analyze the data for each o utcome to: Determine whether the desired outcome was met or if performance gaps exist. Identify mitigating factors that may have affected performance. Determine strategies for improving performance. Suggest changes or additions to objectives. 66 The data are then submitted to the Evaluation Committee who reviews the data performance and the comm ittee's or administrator's data assessme nt. The Evaluation Commi ttee provides an objective review of the information presented, and discusses whether: The data presented are complete and performance is accurately analyzed and represented. Strategies to close gaps are reasonable and achie vable. Data collection problems exist. Changes should be made to the desired outcome of the objective. The responsible administrator then presents the data and findings to the Dean's Council in person. In an oversig ht and directive role, the Dean's Council considers all information presented. The Dean's Council endorses or amends the Evaluation Comm ittee's recommendations and directs the responsible administrator and or committee to make neces sary changes in data collection activities or desired outcomes/performance targets. These data inform the college's strategic planning process. 67 Template B5 -1 Evaluation Data Evaluation Measure Data Collection Method Responsibility for Review Instructional Goal 1: Recruit and Matriculate an Ethnically, Geographically, Socioeconomically and Academically Diverse and Qualified Student Body Scope of recruitment activities to reach diverse and qualified prospective students The Office of Student Services provides this information.

Kacey Ernst and Paloma Beamer, Co -Chairs, Committee on Inclusion and Equity 2) Briefly describe how the chosen evaluation methods and measures track the school's progress in advancing the field of public health (including instruction, scholarship and service) and promoting student success. The following MEZCOPH standing comm ittees are responsible for ov ersight of their corresponding goals and objectives. This includes creating goals and measurable objectives, ensuring the data 73 needed to me asure these goals are available and accurate, and reviewing the data on a yearly basis: Instructional Goals = Education Committee Research Goals = Resea rch Advisory Committee Servi ce Goals = Practice and Servi ce Commi ttee Diversi ty Goals = Committee on Inclusion and Equity Data on these goals and objectives are presented at semi-annual College wide meetings. The evaluation commi ttee meets annually to examine the data for each of the goals and objectives, determine progress, and provide feedback. Every five years goals and objectives are exami ned to determine if they are still appropriate or if new goals and objectives are needed. The Evaluation Commi ttee works with the Dean's Council, Education Committee, Resear ch Advisory Com mittee, unity ce Comm ittee, and the Commi ttee on Inclusion and Equity to revise goals if needed. All revisions must be voted on by the College prior to final approval and implementation of measurement activities. The MEZCOPH Evaluation Comm ittee is responsible for oversig ht of the evaluation processes a nd ensuring that data are utilized to inform decision making and planning processes. The commi ttees listed above review the materials and decide the changes that need to be made after reviewing the data. The Associate Deans are largely responsible for the successful accomplishment of the goals and for using the feedback to enhance the quality of programs and activities. Each Associate Dean has an advisory coun cil to assist in this oversight and implementation and the Dean's Council oversees the organizational goals. Although we have measures that indicate specific targets, we do not just review if we meet them or not. We use the data to determine if we should be modifying our evaluation goals, eliminating outdated goals . Some specific examples include the changing a goal to have to have a specific target for the percent of students from our four corner states since we now work extensively with WRGP and have a l arger student body with greater national recruitment due to SOPHAS and other outreach efforts. We also added new goals based on faculty feedback to develop specific goals for Inclusion and Equity. Below are examples for the main goals. 3) Provide evidence of implementation of the plan described in Template B5 -1. Evidence may include reports or data summaries prepared for review, minutes of meetings at which results were discussed, etc. Evidence must document examination of progress and impa ct on both public health as a field and student success. The college works within committee structure to develop goals and objectives. These committees work with various college offices to identify the data sources or to create data sources that are used to monitor and evaluate the college's goals and objectives. The data are reviewed and presented back to the committees and at our collegewide retreats that are held twice per year. These results are discussed and recommendations are made regarding change s in policies, procedures, goals and objectives based on the analysis of the data, discussions and by the members of the committees and the college . Documentation about recruitment, admissions, how these data were reviewed and decisions ma de are included i n the minutes for our Education Committee. Examples of discussions on goals, objectives and evaluation are from the minutes on : 2/1/17; 3/1/17; 4/5/17; 9/6//17; 11/1/17; 8/1/18; 10/3/18; Finalization of the and objectives are made by the committees a nd presented to the Dean's Council. A flow diagram of this process is provided in ERF B3.2. Instructional Plan Goal 1. Recruit and Matriculate an Ethnically, Geographically, Socioeconomically and Academically Diverse and Qualified Student Body : Our Director of Admissions provides d ata on the number of applicants, acceptance and matriculation rates to the Education committee. The education committee reviews these data during the spring semester as we accept students and at the end of each admission cycle. The steps taken ensure our plan to have a diverse student body includes expanding our recruitment efforts, offering a diverse set of areas of study, and evaluating our admissions criteria. We have made changes to our methods to review applicants to have a more holistic approach that puts less 74 weight on quantitative GPA and GRE scores. Some concentrations have eliminated the GRE for applicants who have extensive public health work experience. (ERF B4 Admissions Criteria by Program ) Goal 2. Educate Individuals for Successful Public Health Professional, Research and Academic Careers : We continue to track how students are engaged in service and research, including publications via our annual pr ogres s reports that are students complete each fall semester. Reports on student authors are also reported by faculty via UAVITA E. This information is reported to the college via emails and at our college -wide retreats . We have expanded the number of ser vice learning courses in our college and the number of courses that include service activities. These courses are provided by each department. (ERF A1.2 ) Goal 3. Foster the Success of our Students : Our OSSAA provides several workshops each year for students to better prepare them for entering the workforce (See Section H2 ). Student and alumni surveys are conducted and consistently indicate that students believe they are ready for the workforce . Goal 4. Provide Well -Trained and Qualified Course Instructors : We have moved to holding more workshops within our college by inviting our University Office of Instruction and Assessment to provide topic specific presentations. We monitor course evaluations and report to the Department Chairs courses with low evaluation scores in order to have instructors take needed steps to improve their teaching or to identify an instructor who is a better fit for the course (See Section E2) Research Plan : Goals 1 & 2. (1) Have externally funded grants and contracts that support public health research and (2) Have faculty engaged in externally funded research . We continue to track our grant revenue by department. Additionally, our Research Advisory Committee reviews grants before they are submitted to enhance the probability of faculty obtaining extramural funding. Tenure track junior faculty are also given significant release tim e at the start of their employ ment to enhance the start of their research careers. Senior faculty are also encouraged and taking the in itiative to support junior faculty as mentors on K - awards or supporting minority supplements. (See Section E4). Goals 3 & 4. (3) Have a faculty that is actively publishing in academic journals and (4) Have students actively participate in research project: Our College has created writing support sessions that provides faculty a quiet and supportive environment to write. These sessions were created by Dr. Melanie Bell. Additional support groups are also now in place between faculty. We track the number of publications with student authors. Our statistical consulting class, also taught by Dr. Bell, provides an opportunity for students to work on faculty data that can result in publications. Service Plan Goal 1. Have faculty and academic professionals are involved in community engagement, outreach, practice and service activities : We implement this plan by tracking faculty engagement using the UAVITA system during annual performance evaluations. Faculty report which activities and research they conduct include community service. Goal 2. Have undergraduate public health and MPH student internships that are community -based : All internships are tracked for the type of community engagement they include. Student handbooks describe how students select internship sites and activities Goal 3. Provide workforce development/continuing education activities : We implement this plan by tracking faculty engagement in providing workforce development and supporting continuing education using the UAVITA system during annual p erformance evaluations. Faculty report which activities and researc h they conduct include workforce development. Additionally, the college's public health training center actively recruits faculty and students to generate workforce development and continuing education activities. 75 Diversity and Inclusive Excellence Pl an Goal 1. Develop and Sustain a Diverse and Robust Academic Community : Our College reviews the diversity of its faculty and students through reports (See Section G1) from data collected by the University. We also have conducted our own internal surveys ( Section G ) and are currently in the process of conducting a comprehensive survey on the college 's environment with regards to inclusion and equity that will be conducted by a third party independent of the college. Goal 2. Actively mai ntain a stable, fair and equitable organization that supports the programs, practice and policies of MEZCOPH : Faculty governance was established when the college was created and is maintained through a committee system. Our by -laws are reviewed and have b een revised several times by the voting members of the college (See Bylaws ERF A1 and ERF A1.a ). Goal 3. Stand as a model of equity and inclusion by creating a scholarly community that understands values and respects all individuals so students, faculty and staff can achieve their full potential as public health leaders : MEZCOPH has developed many procedures to support an equitable scholarly community. We utilize a standard statement regarding diversity and equity when posting positions and request that applicants for faculty positions state their approach to supporting inclusion and equity. MEZCOPH was also the first college at the university to complete an inclusive excellence inventory that was requested by the President's Office on I nclusion and Equity. From this inventory, we created a strategic plan that covers six content areas: 1) Structure, 2) Governance and Leadership, 3) Environment and Climate, 4) Instruction - Classroom and Content, 5) Faculty and Staff, and 6) Assessment. ( See Section G1) 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 76 B6. USE OF EVALUATION DATA 77 B6. Use of Evaluation Data The school engages in regular, substantive review of all evaluation findings, as well as strategic discussions about the implications of evaluation findings. The school implements an explicit process for translating evaluation findings into programmatic plans and changes and provides evidence of changes implemented based on evaluation findings. 1) Provide two to four specific examples of programmatic changes unde rtaken in the last three years based on evaluation results. For each example, describe the specific evaluation finding and the groups or individuals responsible for determining the planned change, as well as identifying the change itself. Activities to Monitor and Improve Classroom Teaching Instructional Goal 4 was established to maintain a high quality of instruction within the classes. The Office of Academic Affairs did not have a standard method for monitoring how many faculty members were participating in activities that kept them up -to-date regarding online teaching, the use of new technologies and new approaches to teaching and learning. Thus, t he College started to have a set of workshops to ensure that faculty stay current on vari ous issues related to pedagogy . These workshops have now focused on team teaching, group projects and teaching in collaborative learning rooms. Additional training on pedagogy has always been available through the UA Office of Instruction and Assessment (O IA). However, given the review of teaching course evaluations and feedback from advisors in the Office of Student Services and Academic Affairs , it was decided that we would need provide these workshops in house and have them specifically for the MEZCOPH f aculty. Our data show that very few courses have low teaching effectiveness scores (3%) , low course ratings (less th an 3 on a 1 -5 scale) . The Office of Academic Affairs now sends the list of courses with low scores to the Department Chairs so they may have a discussion with the instructors of these courses to determine the reasons for the low scores and potential ways to increase the scores . Peer Evaluations of Proposal before Submission Research Goal 1.2 states that primary faculty (at least half -time) will, on average, be externally funded for at least 30% time for research, training and/or other scholarly activity. While we were meeti ng this criterion in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, there was room for increasing external funding and also concern that the external funding environment was becoming more competitive. Therefore, the Associate Dean for Research collected MEZCOPH faculty input for potential mechanisms to increase external funding. One concept that was well received by the Dean's Council was to focus on assisting faculty in developing more competitive proposals thr ough early review of specific aims pages for first submissions and also review of scored but not funded grant proposals for resubmission. The Associate Dean for Research therefore refocused the Research Advisory Committee (RAC) starting in March of 2017 to provide these services to our faculty, in addition to continuing to provide general overview of our college research support programs. The reengineered RAC has been successful in helping to increase our average percent of external funded salary for our primary faculty from 30% in fiscal year 2017 to 32% in fiscal year 2017 and 37% in fiscal year 2018. Position to Support an Academic Health Department and Increase Community Collaboration Service goal number 3 is focused on faculty participation in work force development. Based on continuing evaluation of outcome data from UAVitae in regards to this goal, it became clear that faculty involvement with our local health department could benefit from a greater degree of organization. Therefore, the Communit y Engagement and Outreach team approached Pima County Health Department (PCHD) leadership about establishing a formal agreement to better coordinate and develop an infrastructure that would support stronger and more effective coordination and collaboration . 78 In order to support the goals and objectives to increase our collaboration with health departments, the College created a position to coordinate these efforts. The position has already advanced our efforts on several fronts. As of July 2019, we have mutually agreed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with PCHD that includes a formal mechanism for identifying student internships, a Min i Public Health School, and Research Fellowship. The student internships coordinate PCHD staff, student and MEZCOPH faculty to collaborate on specific projects and deliverables. At the end of the student projects, PCHD and MEZCOPH organize an internship c onference at the county facility, whereby, staff are invited to participate. The Mini Public Health School encompasses an interactive lecture series designed to share research conducted by MEZCOPH faculty and presented to PCHD staff and leadership. The Re search Fellowship was of great interest to PCHD staff and leadership and matches MEZCOPH faculty research interests with PCHD staff. Staff are afforded opportunities to shadow and collaborate on research projects, grant writing, guest lecturing among other activities, mutually agreed upon. Similarly, we are creating an academic health department with the Maricopa County Public Health Department, Arizona's largest county health department that includes the City of Phoenix. Increase Online Recruitment Effo rts Instructional Goal 1 was developed to recruit and matriculate a diverse and qualified student body. Evaluation of this goal includes reviewing and improving the College's Recruitment Plan each year. In reviewing our recruitment of underrepresented student groups, geographically diverse students, and working professionals, we identified the need to expand our virtual recruitment efforts at the graduate level. In addition, our New Students Survey showed that very few students were rec ruited via in person graduate fairs. Based on this data, our Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs now leads or participates in the following innovative virtual efforts: Online Information Sessions are 1.5-hour live webinars that are offered month ly by the Director of Admissions, Phoenix Coordinator, and Certificate and MS/Doctoral Coordinator. Topics include the highlights of the College of Public Health, graduate degree offerings and curriculum, admissions requirements, the application process, t uition, and financial assistance for all prospective MPH, Online MPH, MS, PhD, DrPH, graduate certificate, and non -degree seeking students. Ample time is given for questions. Virtual Visit Week is a week -long event held during the first week of April every year. This event includes 45-minute sessions presented by each Program Director, as well as sessions by graduate students, leaders of service learning, and the Office of Student Services. Each session begins with a 15-20-minute presentation, followed by a question and answer session. Sessions are recorded and shared with those who register for the event. Virtual This Is Public Health Fairs are sponsored by ASPPH and are offered quarterly. These fairs, as well as other virtual fairs we participate in (Vete rans Virtual Fair, Diversity Virtual Fair, etc.), give us the opportunity to chat online with prospective students. All of these virtual events are advertised via the SOPHAS Events webpage, the MEZCOPH website, social media, MailChimp announcements to our prospect list, and to advisors across the UA campus and nationally. These events have been invaluable in increasing our reach to regional, national, and international prospective students. Change in GRE Requirements Instructional Goal 1 was developed t o recruit and matriculate a diverse and qualified student body. The evaluation data includes reviewing admissions data around incoming GPA and GRE scores. In 2016, the Director of Admissions worked with two graduate students in BIOS 576C Applied Biostatist ics Analysis to look at predicting success in public health graduate programs, based on admissions data for incoming graduate students (GPAs including cumulative, lower division, upper division, math/statistics, science, social science, and graduate; GRE s cores; and 1 st generation college student status) and outcomes in graduate school (narrowly defined as final graduate GPA and whether a student completed a graduate program in a timely manner). Their analysis showed that the upper division GPA had the stro ngest association with final graduate level GPA for most graduate programs. Based on this data, we made two major changes to our admissions process. We anticipate that these changes will allow us to rely less on standardized test scores and more on a holi stic admissions review. These changes are: 79 In 2017, we implemented holistic admissions processes. Although many of our faculty believed in the tenets of holistic admissions, until seeing this data, some programs continued to use minimum cut -off points for GRE scores. We now utilize a set of holistic admissions guidelines that are shared with faculty when they begin reviewing applications and are discussed at the beginning of each admissions committee meeting. These guidelines state that all applications are reviewed; all facets of an application are reviewed; programs list competitive GRE levels, but not minimum cut -offs; and that applicants with low GPAs or low GREs are encouraged to write about the obstacles they have faced in their application. In 2018 a nd 2019, the Director of Admissions led a series of a discussions with the academic programs around the predictive value of GRE scores, using internal and external data. As a result of these discussions, starting in fall 2020, the GRE requirement will be w aived for all MPH applicants who meet one or more of the following criteria: prior master's degree from a U.S. institution, prior doctoral degree from a U.S. institution, international medical graduates who are ECFMG certified, five or more years of relev ant work experience, or completed a graduate certificate from MEZCOPH with a 3.5 GPA or higher. 2) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 80 C1. FISCAL RESOURCES 81 C1. Fiscal Resources The school has financial resources adequate to fulfill its stated mission and goals. Financial support is adequate to sustain all core functions, including offering coursework and other elements necessary to support the full array of degrees and ongoing operations. 1) Describe the school's budget processes, including all sources of funding. This description addresses the following, as applicable: In the past 5 years, MEZCOPH has continued to increase its financial resources to fulfill our mission and goals. This increase was made possible through building strong and innovative academic and research programs and providing solid support system to students and faculty. The implementation of Responsibility Ce ntered Management (RCM) also had a very positive impact on both courses offered and the tuition received. RCM is based on a cost and benefit relationship through which teaching effort is recognized via an increased tuition allocation. As Template C1 -1 show s, the State appropriation, which represents base tuition revenue, received by MEZCOPH increased from $6.8 million in FY2015 to $10.3 million in FY2019. This means the College has been developing and offering new courses welcomed by students. MEZCOPH has developed online degree programs in the past 3 to 4 years. The biggest growth came from the online MPH program which currently (Summer 2019) has 259 students enrolled. This program, started in FY2016, earned a gross revenue of over $5 million in FY2019. The online platform allowed the education in public health to be more flexible and assessable to a wide range of population s. The additional financial resources created are used to support new course development, hire quality instructors, and improve the College's educational infrastructure. The College's Phoenix campus is growing rapidly and is now poised to expand its academic, research, and outreach programs in Phoenix metropolitan area and beyond. In addition to the College's investment in new faculty hiring for our Phoenix campus, UAHS has assigned MEZCOPH Phoenix campus more than 7,000 square feet of additional space to support program growth and shared student space. The Phoenix program currently operates on an annual budget of more than $1 million with support from the College, grants and contracts, and other University resources. UA's Provost Office and Health Sciences provide support in faculty hiring in salaries and startup packages. In the past couple of years, the College received one third s alary support for 3 years for 6 faculty and 3 postdoc hires. In many cases, UAHS and Vice President for Research (VPR) provided one third of the startup packages to T and TE faculty hires. Other internal funding opportunities described earlier also provid ed additional financial resources to the College. Opportunities for new resources continue to present themselves through the hard work of our administrators and faculty. For example, the College is taking the lead in several strategic initiatives as part of the University's overall strategic plans. The initiatives, when selected for funding by the University, will be awarded financial resources to grow either new programs or establish research centers within the College or as a collaboration with other units. To support these processes, MEZCOPH completes an annual all -funds budget in spring as part of the University wide planning process. This is a multi -step process that involves the following: - review the past revenues and expenses for trending analysi s; - project student enrollment and credit hours; - forecast revenues from all sources; - plan new hires of faculty and postdoc; - review salary and other commitments; - plan strategic investments for programs and other initiatives; - project expenses in all operation al categories; and - review current and projected fund balance for reasonability and sustainability. 82 The College utilizes funding source s from allocated tuition revenue, differential tuition and program fees, online program tuition, grants and contracts, indirect cost allocations, other designated funds, gifts, interest from endowments, and other restricted revenue to support annual operati onal needs (e.g. personnel, employee related expenses, operational/travel needs, capital equipment, student support, etc.). As shown by Template C1 -1, in the past couple of year s, the College's revenue has consistently exceeded the expenses. The financi al resources are adequate to fulfill our mission and goals. State Appropriations The University of Arizona implemented Responsibility Centered Management (RCM) as of FY2016. The state appropriations represent the amount of tuition dollars allocated to each college based on the number of credits taken and the number of students whose majors are affiliated with each college. Under the RCM, colleges are funded more appropriately based on the teaching effort and ability to attract students with innovative courses and strong student support systems. Since the implementation of RCM, the amount of tuition allocated to MEZCOPH has increased steadily from $6.8 million in FY2015 to $10.3 million in FY2019. This is the result of increased teaching eff ort, new courses, innovative programs, and strong support to students. Program Fees and Differential Tuition Differential tuition or program fees are applied to all graduate and undergraduate academic programs in the MEZCOPH as follows: BS in Public Heal th: $50 per unit MPH, MS, PhD, and DrPH: $75 per unit ACTR (UA Clinical & Translational Research) , GHD (Global Health and Development) , and HA (Health Administration) Graduate Certificate Programs: $250 per unit MD- Public Health Certificate - Phoenix: $ 600 per semester regardless of units taken In FY2019, the College received $630,000 in program fees and differential tuition after 12.38% of central support tax, 3.5% central investment tax, and 14% tuition set -aside for scholarship. Online Program Tuit ion MEZCOPH has been collaborating with Pearson Embanet in the past three years in delivering the online MPH program. The number of students enrolled have increased steadily. The tuition revenue after the Pearson service fee, increased from $ 350K in FY2016 to $2.8 million in FY2019 . FY2019 net revenue after all expenses was $1.2 million. Grants and Contracts Research and service grants and contracts comprise 50% of the College's total budget and support on average 30% of the faculty salary. Funding includ es federal sources such as NIH, FEMA, CDC, and EPA; state/local sources such as Arizona Department of Health Services, City of Tucson, and Pima County; and private sources such as Mariposa Community health Center and Water Quality Association. Even when fa ced with a national trend of shrinking federal funding for research, the College was able to maintain a total grant revenue of $15 million per year in the past 4 years. Indirect Cost Recovery The current federally negotiated on -campus indirect rates are as follows: - organized research: 53.5% - instruction: 50% - other sponsored activity: 47% - Off campus projects:26% The University of Arizona's indirect cost (IDC) revenue distribution practice is to return 25% of the total revenue received to each coll ege generated those revenues. The College receives about $800K indirect cost revenue each year. MEZCOPH has a long -standing practice to share a portion of the indirect cost revenue with faculty researchers. Faculty researchers receive 12.5% of the total 83 indirect cost revenue received by the College on a quarterly basis. Departments also receive indirect cost revenue allocation annually. These funds are used at the discretion of the researchers or department heads according to the University policies an d procedures. Other Designated or Restricted Revenue Other Designated Revenue primarily consists fixed price complete contract revenue and awards generated through the institution for student, faculty or college related activities. Some research projects are also funded from Other Restricted Revenue sources such as Technology Research Initiative Fund (TRIF), the Arizona Area Health Education Center (AzAHEC), etc. These revenue sources are reported under the University Funds in Template C1 -1. Restricted Gifts and Endowments MEZCOPH works with the University of Arizona Foundation (UAF), which is the formal channel for private gifts to the University. The College currently maintains a fund balance of over $2.6 million in restricted gifts and $13 million in endowed gifts. Student scholarships continue to maintain a primary funding focus via annual fundraising activities. FY2019 student scholarships paid from gifts and interests generated by the endowed funds totaled approximately $400,000. In addition, th e College is focusing fundraising activities in academic programming. In January 2019, the Zuckerman Family Foundation pledged a two -million -dollar gift with half going towards scholarship and half for academic programs. Additional gifts from other donors are being received as matching funds to the Zuckerman gift challenge. a) Briefly describe how the school pays for faculty salaries. If this varies by individual or appointment type, indicate this and provide examples. MEZCOPH has a long -standing policy of promoting both teaching and research, as well as service to the University and community. Faculty are compensated based on the efforts in these three components. The average teaching load for the tenured or tenure -eligible (T & TE) faculty is 3 courses each year including student advising effort. Teaching and service effort generally comprise 51% of effort and is funded by the RCM allocated tuition and other tuition and fees. New T & TE faculty are supported 100% fo r 2 to 3 years and are expected to support 49% of their salaries through grants and contracts or performing additional duties by the end of this startup period. The College reserves a pool of fund to bridge faculty members when a justified need arises. Career track faculty is funded through teaching, research, and other types of funding. Lecturers are funded mainly through teaching. The effort for teaching a 3 -unit course is 10% FTE per fiscal year, same as that of the T & TE faculty. This 10% annualized effort is equivalent to 34.5% effort during a semester. For all faculty, the student mentoring and advising effort ranges from 5% to 10% FTE per fiscal year depending on the number of master and doctoral students. Part-time instructors are funded by the number of courses taught. The compensation level varies based on the different programs where the courses are housed. For example, teaching an on - campus 3 -unit course is $5,000 and leading and teaching an online pro gram course is $6,000. b) Briefly describe how the school requests and/or obtains additional faculty or staff (additional = not replacements for individuals who left). If multiple models are possible, indicate this and provide examples. The need for additi onal faculty or staff normally starts with discussion between the Department Heads and the Dean. This usually happens when additional courses are added, or new programs are to be initiated. The requests are then presented to the Dean's Council for consid eration of funding and evaluated if the position aligns with the College 's mission and priorities. The finalized faculty and postdoc positions are included in the annual hiring plan and presented to the Senior Vice President for UA's Health Sciences (UAHS ). 84 c) Describe how the school funds the following: a. Operational costs (schools define \"operational\" in their own contexts; definition must be included in response) Operational costs are defined as any non -personnel costs such as supplies, travel, equipment, and other professional services, etc. Operational costs can be funded from various funding sources. The College 's and Department s' administrative operational costs are usually funded by tuition and indirect cost revenues. Operational costs for a specific project or program could be funded by tuition revenues , indirect costs revenues, other University funding, or gift funds. The operational costs for sponsored projects are generally funded by the sponsored funding except certain costs such as off ice supplies that are generally considered as indirect costs. b. Student support, including scholarships, support for student conference travel, support for student activities, etc. The University of Arizona provides centralized student financial aid suppor t where extensive categories of scholarships are available for students to apply. The Graduate College provides several aid programs such as the University Fellowship which allows the College to give out awards from this allocated pool of funds. In additio n, the Graduate College provides a pool of fund for tuition waiver for graduate assistants, University Fellows, and students enrolled in the Graduate Interdisciplinary Programs (GIDP). At the College level, student support such as scholarships or tuitio n waiver is funded by gifts and tuition set -aside dollars. Grants and contracts may also provide tuition waiver to graduate assistants. Total scholarships provided in the past couple of years have increased from $450,000 in FY2015 to $ 770,000 in FY2019. Th e amount of tuition waiver provided increased from $ 222,000 in FY2015 to $ 627,000 in FY2019. Support for student travel or other activities may come from tuition set -aside, gifts, other University funds, UA's internal grants, and gift funds. For example, MEZCOPH established a Dean's Annual Fund Award that supports a variety of scholarly activities including student and faculty seed grants, scholarships, internships, student and faculty travels, lecture series, and community programs. c. Faculty development expenses, including travel support. If this varies by individual or appointment type, indicate this and provide examples Faculty development is funded by both the College and the Departments regardless of the appointment type. New T&TE faculty generally are provided with 2 to 3 year s of research and development funding as the startup package. For all faculty who participate in research, as described earlier in this Section, 12.5% of the IDC revenue received by the College is distributed to the faculty on a quarterly basis. Faculty can use this fund for research and travel purposes. Other sources supporting faculty development include the Dean's Annual Fund Award and faculty mini grants. The University also provides internal awards to support faculty research and travel. Additional information about the University and other funding sources are described in the Section d) below. d) In general terms, describe how the school requests and/or obtains additional funds for operational costs, s tudent support and faculty development expenses. The University generally does not provide additional dollar for college operational costs during the year after the annual tuition allocation is distributed via RCM in early fall. On the other hand, 85 there are several mechanisms available during the year to request funding for new faculty hire and new program startup: The Strategic Priorities Faculty Initiative (SPFI) provides temporary University financial support to academic departments to make additional full-time, tenure -track faculty or continuing -eligible academic professionals who will enhance the University's distinctive strengths in advancing Inclusive Excellence via equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion. This funding opportunity normally funds one third of the faculty salary for 2 to 3 years. The Provost Investment Fund (PIF) provides funding to mission -driven requests from across campus. This funding opportunity calls for proposal twice a year and funds projects ranging from curriculum develo pment to building construction. Senior Vice President for Research provides many internal funding opportunities such as Faculty Seed Grants, Equipment Enhancement Fund, Postdoctoral Research Development Fund, and Student Team Awards. Other University int ernal funding opportunities offered by various programs funded by grants and gifts. e) Explain how tuition and fees paid by students are returned to the school. If the school receives a share rather than the full amount, explain, in general terms, how the sh are returned is determined. If the school's funding is allocated in a way that does not bear a relationship to tuition and fees generated, indicate this and explain. As explained earlier, the University implemented RCM since FY2016. The tuition and fees paid are returned to each college via a cost allocation method through the RCM model. The general allocation rules are: - Undergraduate tuition: 75% of the tuitions are allocated via Student Credit Hour (SCH) taught by each college based on the instruc tor's source of salaries; 25% of the tuitions are returned to the college s house the major of the students. - Graduate tuition: 25% of the tuitions are allocated via Student Credit Hour (SCH) taught by each college based on the instructor's source of salaries; 75% of the tuitions are returned to the colleges house the major of the students. Central support costs are deducted as follows: - Undergraduate tuition: 30.96% assessment for support costs, 2.75% to 5% for Strategic Investment Fund - Graduate tuitio n: 17% Regent set -aside, 12.38% assessment for support costs, 2.75% to 5% for Strategic Investment Fund - Program fees and differential tuition (PFDT): 14% Regent set -aside, 12.38% assessment for support costs, 2.75% to 5% for Strategic Investment Fund - Indirect costs: 75% retained by the University to cover central support cost and facilities related costs f) Explain how indirect costs associated with grants and contracts are returned to the school and/or individual faculty members. If the school and its faculty do not receive funding through this mechanism, explain. As explained earlier, 25% of indirect costs are returned to the College. 12.5% of the total indirect cost revenue returned to the College is allocated to faculty members whose grants earned the revenue. 86 2) A clearly formulated school budget statement in the format of Template C1 -1, showing sources of all available funds and expenditures by major categories, for the last five years. Template C1 -1 Sources of Funds and Expenditures by Major Category: July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2019 FY2015 FY2016 FY2017 FY2018 FY2019 Source Notes: 1. Tuition & Fees include program fees and differential tuitions, online program tuitions, summer program tuitions, and global program tuitions. 2. State Appropriation is allocated based on the RCM model, therefore represents the on -campus program base tuition revenue. 3. University Tax includes both indirect cost expenses and other centrally assessed administrative taxes. 4. Transfer of Funds: Amounts entered include only transfers from MEZCOPH to other colleges or units to support programs or fulfill commitments. 5. Endowment is not expendable, therefore is taken out of the Source. Instead, the bal ance of the Endowment fund is presented. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 87 C2. FACULTY RESOURCES 88 C2. Faculty Resources The school has adequate faculty, including primary instructional faculty and non -primary instructional faculty, to fulfill its stated mission and goals. This support is adequate to sustain all core functions, including offering coursework and advising stud ents. The stability of resources is a factor in evaluating resource adequacy. Students' access to a range of intellectual perspectives and to breadth of thought in their chosen fields of study is an important component of quality, as is faculty access to colleagues with shared interests and expertise. All identified faculty must h ave regular instructional responsibility in the area. Individuals who perform research in a given area but do not have some regular expectations for instruction cannot serve as one of the three to five listed members. 1) A table demonstrating the adequacy of the school's instructional faculty resources in the format of Template C2 -1.

These individuals may appear multiple times if their responsibilities and training/experience are appropriate to count in multiple concentrations. +Additional Faculty must be individually identified in Templates E1 -1 and E1 -2, as applicable. PIF and non -PIF faculty identified in other concentrations in the table may be included in this headcount if th eir responsibilities and training/experience are appropriate to count in multiple concentrations. 90 The FTE indicated below each faculty name should denote the contribution to the school as a whole rather than to individual concentrations. 2) All primary instructional faculty, by definition, are allocated 1.0 FTE. Schools must explain the method for calculating FTE for any non -primary instructional faculty presented in C2 -1. The FTE calculation for Non -primary faculty is determined on teaching and mentoring load along with any additional research and service that the faculty member conducts on behalf of MEZCOPH. Teaching a 3-semester credit course is considered 0.10 FTE on a f iscal year (0.33 FTE during a semester). Faculty can receive an additional 0.05 to 0.10 FTE (fiscal year) based on the extent that they are advising and mentoring students. Additional FTE may be supported by internal and extramural funds for supporting re search and service activities. 3) If applicable, provide a narrative explanation that supplements reviewers' understanding of data in the templates. Not Applicable. 4) Data on the following for the most recent year in the format of Template C2 -2. See Template C2-2 for additional definitions and parameters. The Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs includes several academic advisors who are responsible for undergraduate students. The undergraduate advisors are assigned students based on the first letter of their last name and thus the number the stud ents being advised per advisor slightly varies (Table C2 -2). The lead academic advisor has a lower advising load than the other advisors based and is why the minimum is much lower than the average. Additionally, the maximum for the number of Master student is skewed a bit high due to our MD -MPH program. These students are across four years of medical school and assigned to one faculty member. They require significantly less advising time as each class is about 10 students. The data for the advising is bas ed on spring 2019. Although these numbers may vary semester to semester based on graduation, they represent the normal average and range for advising. Template C2 -2.

If both primary instructional faculty and non-primary instructional faculty or staff are regularly involved in these activities, stratify the data. Min is the lowest number of students that a faculty member advises and Max is the highest number of students that a faculty member advises at defined point in time, chosen by the school or program. Point in time must be suitably representative (eg, sixth w eek of fall semester). Mentoring/primary advising on thesis, dissertation or DrPH integrative project counts first readers only. Backup documentation used in calculations are provided in ERF C2 . Schools should only present data on public health degrees and concentrations. 5) Quantitative data on student perceptions of the following for the most recent year. Schools should only present data on public health degrees and concentrations. a. Class size and its relation to quality of learning (eg, the class size was conducive to my learning) Recent Spring 2019 graduates were asked to respond to a question on their Exit Survey if class sizes were conducive to the learning experience during their program. Responses were on a Likert Scale, 1 being poor an d 5 being excellent. All degree groups had an average rating of 4.00 or greater (Table C1); reflecting that the siz e of our classes are conducive for the learning experience. Table C1 . Student Perceptions on Class Sizes Number of Respondents Class sizes were conducive to the learning experience BS 166 4.09 MPH 80 4.64 MS/DrPH/PhD 4 4.00 Total 250 4.26 b. Availability of Faculty ( i.e., Likert scale of 1 -5, with 5 as very satisfied) Recent Spring 2019 graduates were asked to respond to a question on their Exit Survey related to faculty availability . Responses were on a Likert Scale, 1 being poor and 5 bein g excellent. All degree groups had an average rating of 4.00 or greater ( Table C2); reflecting that faculty are meeting our students' expectations for their availability. 92 Table C2. Student Perceptions on Faculty Availability Number of Respondents Faculty availability to students (Includes but not limited to meeting outside of class, holding office hours, or communicating via email) BS 166 4.33 MPH 80 4.38 MS/DrPH/PhD 4 4.00 Total 250 4.34 6) Qualitative data on student perceptions of class size and availability of faculty. Only present data on public health degrees and concentrations. In the Exit Survey, graduating students are asked to provide strengths and weaknesses of faculty advising. Of the students expecting to graduate in 2018 and 2019, 129 graduate level students (122 MPH, 3 MS, 3 DrPH, and 1 PhD) provided comments related to faculty advising. Comments were reviewed. There were 109 comments on strengths and 68 comments on weaknesses. Many students described having good or great communication with their faculty advisors. When seeking help, faculty provided resources, opportunities, and or insight/experience that was useful. Many also described the faculty as engaged, understanding, and supportive. Many fac ulty members were cited by name for their strengths as faculty advisors. It was noted that some faculty were perceived to be more engaged and or approachable than others. In the weaknesses, students described there was confusion on topics such as internship requirem ents, organization , and or procedures/paperwork. There were also comments that faculty can be perceived as \"busy\" or \"more focused on research\" and not always readily available. Timely responsiveness to emails was also a commonly described weakness. A complete listing of the individual comments is provided in ERF C 2. A focus group with 14 undergraduate students in summer 2019 focused on the pre -public health to public health process, the combination of online and face -to-face classes and the quality o f instruction in the program and to a lesser extent advising. They had no problem with the sizes of our courses including the introductory courses (178 and 200) as they are our largest classes. However, within this discussion students were not sure how w ell the discussion boards are actually being monitored and graded as many stated they got all the points for participating. Group projects were also a concern. The students understood that they were being asked to do this to help them prepare for the work force. Issues related to group projects include that not everyone provides the same input but all get the same grade at times but they also acknowledged that there are peer evaluations that are also used to adjust grades. They also thought that they do no t need to get this experience in so many classes and often can learn the information by doing projects on their own. In response to this input, MEZCOPH held a workshop at the start of the fall 2019 semester on group projects for our faculty that was provi ded by the University Office Instruction and Assessment that addressed these issues. The students were very pleased with the advising that they received. The main issue that was raised by some students was how t he advisors would not allow them to take more than 19 units. Some students explained that this was due to the number of hours that would be required for doing an internship but others stated that they still could not take more courses. Most of the students believed that they should be the ones to determine if they can handle the workload or not. 7) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 93 C3. STAFF AND OTHER PERSONNEL RESOURCES 94 C3. Staff and Other Personnel Resources The school has staff and other personnel adequate to fulfill its stated mission and goals. The stability of resources is a factor in evaluating resource adequacy. 1) A table defining the number of the school's staff support for the year in which the site vi sit will take place by role or function in the format of Template C3 -1. Designate any staff resources that are shared with other units outside the unit of accreditation. Template C3 -1 Schools' Staff Support Role/function FTE College Wide Administration & Support Services Admin & Program Support 9.75 Academic Affairs 5.00 Student Services 10.00 Finance, Facilities, and Human Resources 8.00 IT Support 5.50 Development Office 2.00 Corporate Relations & Alumni Affairs 1.50 Epidemiology/Biostatistics Department Administration 1.00 Program/Project Personnel 6.66 Health Promotion Sciences Department Administration 1.00 Program/Project Personnel 55.82 Community, Environment & Policy Department Administration 1.00 Program/Project Personnel 16.54 Public Health Practice/Trans Research Department Administration 1.00 Program/Project Personnel 5.00 Global Health Institute Program Coordination 1.00 Center for Rural Health Administrative Support 1.00 Finance 1.00 Program/Project Personnel 17.83 Total Staff FTE 150.60 95 2) Provide a narrative description, which may be supported by data if applicable, of the contributions of other personnel. Other than faculty and staff, graduate assistants, postdoctoral researchers, and student workers are part of the College's workforce. Graduate students are hired as either Teaching Assistant (TA) or Research Assistant (RA). In FY2019, the College hired 77 TAs and 23 RAs for a total of 42.15 FTE. TAs are funded by the College and assigned to specific courses to assist with student an d faculty support, including activities such as reviewing and grading assignments, responding to student questions, and preparing and providing lectures under the supervision of the faculty member. RAs are normally hired by faculty and funded via grants, g ifts, or startup packages. The College also funds a 0.25 FTE GA for each Department. The College currently has 5 Postdoctoral Scholars (Postdoc) and is planning to hire 5 to 6 more in the coming year. Each Postdoc is assigned a faculty supervisor and is generally funded via research grants or other institutional sources. In addition to the grant funded Postdocs, the College funds 1 FTE Postdoc for each Department. The primary responsibility of the Postdocs is research and related activities. The Coll ege and Departments also hire hourly student workers to assist with some routine administrative work and one -time projects. Hiring hourly student workers is a common practice across campus and it benefits both the students and the hiring units. 3) Provide narrative and/or data that support the assertion that the school's staff and other personnel support is sufficient or not sufficient. The current staff and other personnel support meet the need of the College, the Departments, and faculty. Additional staff and other personnel could be added as the College and Departments develop new programs, hiring new faculty members, and bringing new grant and gift funding. The College level administrative and program support personnel include : 1 Special Assistant to the Dean, 1 staff supporting the Associate Dean for Research, 1.25 FTE staff supporting the Associat e Dean for Outreach and Community Engagement, 0.5 FTE staff supporting the Committee on Equity and Inclusion, and 1 Communication Director. In addition, there are 5 program staff working for the Western Region Public Health Training Center led by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. The following services are supported centrally at the College level: - Academic Curriculum - Student Services - Finance, Facilities, and Human Resources - Information Technology - Development and External Relations There are two academic curriculum coordinators for the College, one located in the Tucson campus and one in Phoenix. These two positions coordinate the cours e offering and classroom arrangements. The Tucson position also provides support to activities related to Academic Affairs.

Not applicable. 102 C5. INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES 103 C5. Information and Technology Resources The school has information and technology resources adequate to fulfill its stated mission and goals and to support instructional schools. Information and technology resources include library resources, student access to hardware and software (including access to specific software or ot her technology required for instructional schools), faculty access to hardware and software (including access to specific software required for the instructional schools offered) and technical assistance for students and faculty. 1) Briefly describe, with da ta if applicable, the following: library resources and support available for students and faculty The University of Arizona Health Sciences Library (UAHSL) serves all colleges under the Arizona Health Science Center (AHSC), which include the College of Public Health, Nursing, Pharmacy and Medicine. As part of the University of Arizona Libraries (system ), UAHSL also supports and works in close partnership with all campus libraries in their engagement with the various colleges and programs from the university main campus in Tucson. All affiliated users may access library resources online while off -camp us by authenticating themselves once per session using their campus NetID and Password. This easy process gives them access identical to what they would experience on campus. All UAHS students, faculty and staff have \"24/7\" access to the library. UAHSL regular (staffed) hours are: Monday - Friday 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Saturday - Sunday 9:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. To use the Library after regular staffed hours, UAHSL constituencies pass their identification card (CatCard) over a reader, which opens the do or. UAHSL is moving away from offering lockable study rooms in favor of a system supported by the UA Libraries (system) whereby students may secure online reservations to study rooms (LibCal). Students appreciate the surety of knowing when a room is avai lable. When Information Commons study spaces come online in the new Health Sciences Innovation Building (HSIB) in early 2019, all study rooms including 60 single -person rooms, will be managed through the LibCal system. UAHSL's previous key -based system of circulating keys to lockable study rooms will not scale to the HSIB facility. While in the Library, users have access to lockers for securing possessions. In addition to the physical collection, UAHSL offers a significant and growing electronic collect ion that covers the full spectrum of the biomedical literature and is made available on and off campus via the UAHSL website (http://ahsl.arizona.edu). For example, the libraries license over 200 leading journals and serials in the areas of public health, epidemiology, environmental health and border health with local, state, national and international coverage. They provide access to major databases in the health and social sciences as wells as significant electronic textbooks and a rapidly growing colle ction of other ebooks. In support of the College of Public Health, AHSL provides the following library services: Develops and maintains a collection of print and electronic resources that support the current curriculum and research needs of the college; Provides consistent and reliable access to the collection and resources both on and off campus and via a multitude of information platforms (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.); Utilizes advanced technology and techniques to organize information resou rces for optimal discovery and use (library catalog, search tools, websites); Delivers journal articles and books outside of the library's collection in a manner that is timely and cost effective (interlibrary loan/document delivery); Coordinates and deliv ers video -streaming services for courses. 104 student access to hardware and software (including access to specific software or other technology required for instructional schools) MEZCOPH students, like other University of Arizona students, use the Desire to Learn (D2L) learning management system (LMS) where all of the for -credit courses taught by MEZCOPH requiring an LMS are housed. D2L provides the standard course management funct ions such as learning content, discussions, quizzes and grades but also has third party software int egrations for lecture capture (P anopto), multimedia discussions (Voicethread), online meetings (Zoom), plagiarism detection (Turnitin), etc., along with int egrations into the university's enterprise student information system for automated course enrollments in D2L and grade reporting out from D2L at the end of each semester. Student email services are provided through a contract with Google and its Apps for Education offering. This also provides students the suite of tools available via Google Apps that includes 100 gigabytes of online storage space in Google Drive. Other computing resources for students include: i. Computer Lab In Drachman Hall MEZCOPH's comp uter lab, equipped with 21 Windows personal computers, a printer, and projection equipment, is located on the third floor of Drachman Hall in Room A319.The computer lab is available for general use, Monday through Friday from 8 AM -5 PM, unless the lab has been scheduled for a class, study session, or other College activity.

Wireless Internet Access Wireless access is available throughout and around Drachman Hall via connection to the UAGuest and UAWiFi networks. UAGuest is for use by visitors to our campus. A temporary user id and password are texted back to the user for connection to this network. UAWiFi, on the other hand, is a secure and fast wireless network that is available across most of our campus. Funded by the Student Technology Fee, it brings roaming wireless access for all students, staff and faculty on campus. Connection to UAWiFi requ ires authentication using the university's NetID and password. The UAWiFi network, when connected, allows students to access on -campus networked resources that are generally unavailable over the public Internet, such as the libraries and the university's s tudent information system. faculty access to hardware and software (including access to specific software or other technology required for instructional schools) Faculty's technology resources mainly reflect what's available to students with some minor differences. Email services for faculty and other university employees are provisioned by Microsoft 105 Office 365, through an institutional contract. Other Office365 su ite of applications are also available to faculty and staff including one terabytes of cloud data storage through OneDrive. Other online data storage is available through a contract with Box and faculty members are given 50 gigabytes of personal space with unlimited space made available through departmentally allocated Box folders. Faculty computers and other software that requires license fees are generally procured through a variety of funding sources including grants and contracts, state funding and oth er sources of income. The MEZCOPH IT department configures and purchases these computers and ensures a standard set of University software prior to deployment. For security purposes, all new computers purchased since summer of 2018 have been encrypted prio r to deployment and others purchased prior to that time are being encrypted automatically through a centrally deployed security software policy through SOPHOS Central. UITS offers free high-performance computing resources in the Research Data Center (RDC) , a state -of-the-art facility that hosts large computer clustered systems to analyze massive amounts of collected data. Free: Time on these systems is available at no charge to any faculty, researcher, or student who has a use for HPC systems. Buy-In: Rese archers may also buy in to these systems to receive high -priority access. Contact hpc- consult@list.arizona.edu for more information. technical assistance available for students and faculty Help desk support for students and faculty is available through the central campus IT unit, University IT Services (UITS), through telephone, Chat and online ticket submissions. Help is also availabl e through the college's IT office, but the IT office is mainly the support point of contact for MEZCOPH's faculty and staff. UITS and MEZCOPH use the same help desk ticketing system that allows for collaborative support for faculty and students along with a single source of data for reporting and assessment. UAHSL librarians have developed subject and knowledge management expertise designed to meet the specialized demands of each of the AHSC Colleges. To better support students, faculty and researchers, UA HSL liaison librarians are assigned to and housed within each of the colleges, using an \"embedded librarianship\" model where they become an integral part of that community. MEZCOPH has one \"embedded\" liaison librarian (1.0 FTE) who has expertise in border health, health disparities, community -campus engagement and community -based participatory research (CBPR), Spanish, biomedical informatics, and biological sciences. She is located in Drachman Hall and works closely with MEZCOPH faculty to provide library s ervices that support instruction and research.

When the liaisons are not teaching or meeting with clients, they assist with reference questions , related to coursework or grant preparation or publishing opportunities for faculty and staff. They also work on developing information services for the online certificate programs or online courses. Our liaison is also part of the library's Outreach Ser vices team and partner with, or support faculty researchers in UAHS colleges on community -based projects or programs that integrate information services and/or access to information resources for underserved communities and populations. This includes train ing community health workers, public librarians, and public health professionals and workshops for various programs and local groups. MEZCOPH has access to the statewide Arizona Telemedicine Program to enhance communications and real -time shared instru ction between the two campuses and to support other statewide communication. We have a librarian embedded within MEZCOPH. With staff turnover, we are fortunate to have Jean McClelland as our College's librarian as she has been working on numerous communi ty-based projects as a member of the college over the years and has a degree in library sciences. She is employed by the AHSC library . 107 2) Provide narrative and/or data that support the assertion that information and technology resources are sufficient or not sufficient. Information and technology resources in support of faculty, staff and students are adequate. This assertion is based on the available human resources in the MEZCOPH IT office that supports the college's affiliates. The IT office, headed by a director, is o rganized into a technical, user and business unit support subgroup, a web and application development subgroup and a recently added half -time Data Analyst - a total of 5.5 FTE. In addition to providing broad technical support services to the college's seve n disparate locations that includes the Phoenix campus, the office supports a computer lab and 17 websites, including the Intranet (The Hub), where students and faculty access MEZCOPH specific information and locally developed data collection and workflow applications that largely enable the student experience (e.g. progress reports, Internships, inter -professional experiences). The IT office has developed and continue to support a grant -funded mobile app, Kidenga, for community reporting of mosquito -borne illnesses and mosquito activity, and have requests to develop other applications. IT also provides support for the Western Region Public Health Training Center's Moodle learning management system, used by public health workforce learners. That system has o ver 7000 learners that require technical and end user support. Lastly, a half -time Data Analyst, a position created and filled in January 2019, is supporting the data gathering for the CEPH accreditation Self-study , and is re -architecting the local databas es in the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs for evaluation and reporting. The IT office provides these diverse services to the college's faculty, staff and students with very good feedback based on annual satisfaction surveys. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area.

MPH APPLIED PRACTICE EXPERIENCES 157 D5. MPH Applied Practice Experiences MPH students demonstrate competency attainment through applied practice experiences. The applied practice experiences allow each student to demonstrate attainment of at least five competencies, of which at least three must be foundational competencies (as defined in Criterion D2). The competencies need not be identical from student to student, but the applied experiences must be structured to ensure that all students complete experiences addressing at least five competencies, as specified above. The applied experiences may also address additional foundational or concentration -specific competencies, if appropriate. The school assesses each stud ent's competency attainment in practical and applied settings through a portfolio approach, which demonstrates and allows assessment of competency attainment. It must include at least two products. Examples include written assignments, projects, videos, mu lti-media presentations, spreadsheets, websites, posters, photos or other digital artifacts of learning. Materials may be produced and maintained (either by the school or by individual students) in any physical or electronic form chosen by the school. 1) Briefly describe how the school identifies competencies attained in applied practice experiences for each MPH student, including a description of any relevant policies. In MEZCOPH , each MPH student must complete an internship with an agency/community partner in which they are utilizing their academic knowledge from the MPH curriculum in an applied, real -world setting. The internship experience may fulfill all or part of the Applied Practice Experience requirements. In all MPH concentrations, a minimum of one deliverable must be produced that benefits the internship site in relation to the student's internship project. In most concentrations (Biostatistics, Health Services Administr ation, One Health, MD/MPH, Public Health Practice, Applied Epidemiology, and Health Promotion), students are required to produce a minimum of two agency -based deliverables, thus fulfilling the Applied Practice Experience requirements solely through their i nternship. For the remaining concentrations (Environmental and Occupational Health, Epidemiology, Family and Child Health, Health Behavior Health Promotion, and Public Health Policy and Management), in the event that a student's internship experience cann ot accommodate a second agency -based deliverable, the student may fulfill the requirements of the Applied Practice Experience through their internship and a deliverable produced from a separate specific, concentration -approved applied experience. These ap proved non -internship experiences are outlined in the Approved Concentration Non -Internship Deliverable document. Applied Practice Experience deliverables must be mapped to a total of five MPH competencies. A minimum of three must be MPH Foundational com petencies; the remaining two must come from concentration -specific competencies. Each student is required to write an Executive Summary Report. In the Executive Summary Report, the student must include CEPH Template D5-1, outlining the agency -based deliv erables the student produced mapped to the selected MPH Foundational and concentration -specific competencies. Minimally, the body of the Executive Summary Report must include the student's self -assessment of competency attainment through the development of the related deliverable. Each concentration also requires additional content from the student in the body of the Executive Summary Report. The student submits the final deliverables and the Executive Summary Report to our student intranet, known as the Student Hub. The student's faculty Internship Committee Chair is notified of this submission and is responsible for reviewing and assessing the student's Executive Summary Report and agency -based deliverables. The Internship Committee Chair must be a prim ary faculty member from the student's concentration. In the case of the Family & Child Health and Health Behavior Health Promotion concentrations, the student's Internship Committee Chair may be a primary faculty member from the Health Promotion Sciences d epartment, not just their specific concentration. 158 2) Provide documentation, including syllabi and handbooks, of the official requirements through which students complete the applied practice experience . Documentation is provided in ERF D05. These documents include: APE Internship Manual Approved Concentration Non -Internship Deliverable Document Components for the Internship Presentation Executive Summary Report and Deliverables Faculty Instructions Execu tive Summary Report Concentration Guidelines Executive Summary Report Title Page Executive Summary Report Statement by Author MPH APE and Internship Quick Reference Guide Plan for Internship Form Preceptor Agreement Form Presentation Feedback Form Responsibilities of Internship Participants Rubrics for Assessing APEs Sample Executive Summary Report Formatting Guide U of A International Travel Procedures 3) Provide samples of practice -related materials for individual students from each concentration or generalist degree. The samples must also include materials from students completing combined degree schools, if applicable. The school must provide samples of complete sets of materials (i.e., Template D5 -1 and the work products/documents that demonstrate at least five competencies) from at least five students in the last three years for each concentration or generalist degree. If the school has not produced five students for which complete samples are available, note this and provide all a vailable samples. Although, the implementation of the new criteria started with students who entered the MPH program in fall 2018, our students have implemented internships that have produced products for the organizations that host our students and that address the MPH competencies. Below are examples of these internships. Starting with the fall 2018 class, we now have a defined a method to ensure that the students produce 2 products that are part of their Applied Practice Experience and that these prod ucts combined address at least 5 competencies of which 3 are from the Core MPH competencies. Past examples of Applied Practice Experiences for our On -Campus Program are provided in ERF D 05.2. Template D5 -1 provide examp les of Applied Pr actice Experiences by students before new guidelines were put into place from our Online MPH Program . These repo rts are provided as ePortfolios and provide examples of how these experiences have addressed competencies . 159 Template D5 -1 Examples of Practice -based Products MPH = Foundational | AE HP HSA = Concentration Practice -based products that demonstrate MPH competency achievement Specific products in portfolio that demonstrate application or practice^ Competency as defined in Criteria D2 and D4* MPH -HSA Student ePortfolio 1.

Not applicable. 161 D6. DrPH APPLIED PRACTICE EXPERIENCE 162 D6. DrPH Applied Practice Experience The work product may be a single project or a set of related projects that demonstrate a depth of competence. It may be completed as a discrete experience (such as a practicum or internship) or integrated into school coursework. In either case, the deliverable must contain a reflective component that include s the student's expression of personal and/or professional reactions to the applied practice experience. This may take the form of a journal or other written product, a professional portfolio or another deliverable as appropriate for the school. The schoo l identifies a minimum of five foundational and/or concentration -specific competencies (as defined in Criteria D3 and D4) that are reinforced and/or assessed through application. The school may either choose at least one competency from the leadership, man agement and governance domain in Criterion D3 or choose a concentration -specific competency identified in Criterion D4 if it relates to leadership skills. Competencies may differ from student to student. 1) Briefly describe how the school identifies competencies attained in applied practice experiences for each DrPH student, including a description of any relevant policies. The objectives of both the Applied Practiced Experience and the Integrated Learning Experience are primarily demonstrated in the student's culminating dissertation. All DrPH students enter ing the program in f all 2018 or later complete an advanced practice -based dissertation requiring 800 contact hours. Prior to beginning this work, candidates prepare a proposal that identifies a minimum of five competencies (foundational and/or concentration -specific) that will be demonstrated through the project as well as potential, field -based deliverables the student may produce. The student presents and defends the proposal before the Dissertation Committee which is responsible for ascertaining the appropriateness of each component of the proposal including competencies, specific deliverables, and the reflective component. Evaluations of dissertations include a rubric ( ERF D06.2) identifies how well a student has met their stated competencies. The committee may approve, deny or approve pending revisions. If the outcome is \"deny,\" the student works with the Faculty Advisor to develop a Retention Plan with specific objectives and a concrete deadline. Those that need to make revisions, follow the recommendations and timeline of the committee given at the time of the proposal defense. Additionally, the Graduate College requires that all approved doctoral dissertation p roposals be kept on file as part of the students' permanent record. 2) Explain, with references to specific deliverables or other requirements, the manner through which the school ensures that the applied practice experience requires students to demonstrate leadership competencies . The DrPH dissertation is conducted within the context of a public health agency with the goal of making a meaningful contribution to the agency or general public as defined by the agency. The advanced practice -based dissertation must address a significant public health problem (as defined by the agency or community) that aligns with the student's major area of study. The candidate must demonstrate systems -level thinking, organization and leadership in order to accomplish the applied practice experience. Stu dents work closely with their Chair, Community Mentor, and Committee Members throughout the applied experience to ensure advanced -level practical experiences. By collaborating with practitioners in a real -world setting , students develop leadership competen cies and contribute to the field. The final DrPH dissertation is a single, unifying document that includes the identification and documentation of foundational and/or concentration -specific competency mastery that are reinforced and/or assessed through ap plication. The student may either choose at least one competency from the leadership, management and governance domain or choose a concentration -specific competency if it relates to leadership skills. 163 The student, Chair and later the full committee dete rmine when the dissertation document is sufficiently developed to defend. Candidates present their dissertation experience in a one -hour public seminar and their written dissertation before their Dissertation Committee in a two -hour closed -door defense. Th e committee assesses the student's demonstration of leadership competencies as one component of the assessment rubric, (ERF D60.2) the reflective component and meaningful contribution to the agency. The student may pass, fail or pass pending revisions. \"Pass pending revisions,\" is the most common outcome. These students follow the recommendations and timeline of the committee given at th e time the dissertation defense. 3) Provide documentation, including syllabi and handbooks, of the official requirements through which students complete the applied practice experience. See MCH and PHPM DrPH Handbooks within the ERF D06. 4) Provide samples of practice -related materials for individual students from each concentration or generalist degree. The school must provide samples of complete sets of materials ( i.e., Template D6-1 and the work products/documents that demonstrate at least five competencies) from at least five students in the last three years for each concentration or generalist degree. If the school has not produced five students for which complete sa mples are available, note this and provide all available samples. Although, the implementation of the new criteria started with students w ho entered the DrPH program in fall 2018, our students have implemented DrPH dissertations that have produced products for the organizations that host our students and that address the DrPH c ompetencies. Starting with the f all 2018 class, we now have a defined method to ensure that the students integ rate an applied practice experience within the DrPH dissertation projects. E xamples of recently approved DrPH dissertations proposals are present in the ERF D06.1. The assessment rubric of future DrPH Dissertations that document their applied practice experience is in ERF D06.2. 5) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 164 D7. MPH INTEGRATIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCE 165 D7. MPH Integrative Learning Experience MPH students complete an integrative learning experience (ILE) that demonstrates synthesis of foundational and concentration competencies. Students in consultation with faculty select foundational and concentration -spec ific competencies appropriate to the student's educational and sional certification exams (eg, CPH, CHES/MCHES, REHS, RHIA) may serve as an element of the ILE, but are not in and of themselves sufficient to satisfy this criterion. The school identifies assessment methods that ensure that at least one faculty member reviews each student's performance in the ILE and ensures that the experience addresses the selected foundational and concentration -specific competencies. Fac ulty assessment may be supplemented with assessments from other qualified individuals (eg, preceptors). 1) List, in the format of Template D7 -1, the integrative learning experience for each MPH concentration, generalist degree or combined degree option that includes the MPH. The template also requires the school to explain, for each experience, how it ensures t hat the experience demonstrates synthesis of competencies. Students in all the MPH concentrations take PHP 580 \"Integrated Public Health Learning Experience.\" This is a team -based course taught by high -level experienced public health administrators who h ave worked in the public and private sectors of health care, including the former Director of the Arizona Department of Health Services and who currently services as the Executive Director for the Arizona Public Health Association. This is a case -based course that brings students from all the concentrations together so they can integrate their knowledge from the core and their concentration courses that they have taken. The course itself has students conduct assignments that assesses them on 10 of the foundational MPH competencies. Students also select at least 2 of their concentration -specific competencies at the start of the course to be assessed. Students must have completed or be concurrently finishing their core public health courses and have completed at least 24 total units of course work. The students are evaluated on obtaining selected competencies by the course instructor. The syllabus and assessment tools are available with the MPH syllabi in the ERF D01 (PHP 580) . Template D7-1 MPH Integrative Learning Experience for all Concentration Integrative learning experience (list all options) How competencies are synthesized All MPH students take PHP 580 Integrated Public Health Learning Experience. The course includes analyse s of public health cases that integrate core public health knowledge and competencies to determine the best systems, policies and programs for decreasing morbidity and premature mortality. Additionally, all students conduct an internship project with a minimum of 135 hours with an agency that address various competencies. Each student is assigned to a team of 5-6 students who simulate the leadership team of a local or state health department tasked to assess and propose solutions to a public health issue assigned to them. There are 5 aspects (i.e. description of the issue, possible solutions, proposed approach, implementation, and evaluation) of each issue that must be addressed by each team in separate assignments as described below. Each assignment must be completed as a word document and posted in D2l by the due date. Studen ts then have 2 weeks after assignments are posted to read and comment about other teams' assignments. These comments must be individual student comments, not team comments. Each student must comment about each team assignment, except those from their own team. Internships are also assessed. 166 2) Briefly summarize the process, expectations and assessment for each integrative learning experience. Students participate in a group project to address specific public health issues and propose multiple methodologies and interventions to improve community health. Projects address a set of contemporary public health issues including major infectious diseases, chronic diseases, environment -related conditions, substance abuse, occupational diseases and behavior -related conditions. Projects analyz e the evidence for and against the effectiveness of specific public health interventions, the practical realities and limitations of applying them within public health systems, and the political, legal and ethical controversies that might arise in addressi ng these issues. The course is based on contemporary public health case studies and involve active student participation in problem solving. Students are assessed individually and as part of a team. 3) Provide documentation, including syllabi and/or handbook s that communicates integrative learning experience policies and procedures to students. The syllabus for PHP 580 Integrated Public Health Learning Experience is provide in the ERF D01. 4) Provide documentation, including rubrics or guidelines, that explains the methods through which faculty and/or other qualified individuals assess the integrative learning experience with regard to students' demonstration of the selected competencies. The assessment tools and rubric that are used to assess the competencies are included within the course syllabus located in ERF D01. 5) Include completed, graded samples of deliverables associated with each integrative learning experience option from different concentrations, if applicable. The school must provide at least 10% of the number produced in the last three years or five examples , whichever is greater. Students who started the MPH program in fall 2018 are the first students required to take this course. The course was offered in spring 2019 as a pilot for students who volunteered to take it. The results of this initial offering allowed the college to adjust the course to have it fully implemented in fall 2019 when the first cohort of students who are required to take enroll in it. 6) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 167 D8. DrPH INTEGRATIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCE 168 D8. DrPH Integrative Learning Experience As part of an integrative learning experience, DrPH candidates generate field -based products consistent with advanced practice designed to influence schools, policies or systems addressing public health . The products demonstrate s ynthesis of foundational a nd concentration -specific competencies. The integrative learning experience is completed at or near the end of the school of study. It may take many forms consistent with advanced, doctoral -level studies and university policies but must require, at a mini mum, production of a high -quality written product. 1) List, in the format of Template D8 -1, the integrative learning experience for each DrPH concentration or generalist degree. The template also requires the school to explain, for each experience, how it en sures that the experience demonstrates synthesis of competencies. Template D8 -1. DrPH Integrated Learning Experience for all Concentrations DrPH Integrative Learning Experience for the PHPM and MCH Concentration s Integrative learning experience (list all options) How competencies are synthesized Required applied dissertation - 800 contact hours It is expected that each DrPH candidate will embark upon an Applied Dissertation project within a community agency. The onus is on the student to propose and gain approval from the student's committee for a plan that will produce meaningful deliverables to the organization while demonstrating a mastery level of competencies through application. The end product is a comprehensive written d issertation that demonstrates coherent integration of competencies in a real -world application and must gain final approval from the committee. 2) Briefly summarize the process, expectations and assessment for each integrative learning experience. We have established a comprehensive approach to have DrPH students have an integrated learning experience that is practice based as part of their disser tation. Students are able to identify the competencies that they address with their dissertation and have products that support the organizations that are serve as partners for the dissertation work. It is the Dissertation Committee's responsibility to en sure the student's initial proposal suitably addresses the Integrated Learning Experience objectives and later assesses the success of those endeavors during the Dissertation Defense . The Integrative Learning Experience is interwoven into the advanced pra ctice dissertation. The advanced practice dissertation is also the Applied Practice Experience. Because the dissertation is the culminating experience of the DrPH, students integrate their course work knowledge and skills into the development of a disserta tion proposal. This proposal is then presented to the Dissertation Committee that approves, approves with revision, or denies it. With approval, students advance to the implementation of their projects. Once complete, the written dissertation includes an assessment of the integration of course work through reflection. By identifying learning objectives from foundational and concentration -specific courses the student justifies how their Integrated Learning Experience maps back to these learning objectives an d competencies. 169 3) Provide documentation, including syllabi and/or handbooks that communicates integrative learning experience policies and procedures to students. The Integrative Learning Experience ( ILE) is the dissertation and information about meeting this criterion are within the DrPH MCH and DrPH PHPM Handbooks . These handbooks and other evaluation materials are in ERF D06. 4) Provide documentation, including rubrics or guidelines that explains the methods through which faculty and/or other qualified individuals assess the integrative learning experience with regard to students' demonstration of the selected competencies. The ILE is the dissertation and information about meeting this criterion are within the DrPH MCH and DrPH PHPM Handbooks. These handbooks and other evaluation materials are in ERF D06. 5) Include completed, graded samples of deliverables associated with each integrative learning experience option from different concentrations. The school must provide at least 10% of the number produced in the last three years or five examples, whichever is greater. If the school does not have five recent samples for an option, note this and provide all available samples. Given that this approach to the DrPH dissertation was required for the first tim e with students who started in f all 2018, we do not have any current examples using our required format. What we have included in the ERF are what we consider appropriate examples of past applied practice dissertation that have been conducted by our students. We also have included past DrPH dissertations that ha ve been approved which demonstrate how our students will meet this requirement. See ERF D08 for these documents. 6) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 170 D9. PUBLIC HEALTH BACHELOR'S DEGREE GENERAL CURRICULUM 171 D9. Public Health Bachelor's Degree General Curriculum The overall undergraduate curriculum (eg, general education, liberal learning, essential knowledge and competencies, etc.) introduces stud ents to the following domains.

Public Health Bachelor's Degree Foundational Domains The requirements for the public health major or concentration provide instruction in the following domains. The curriculum addresses these domains through any combination of learning experiences throughout the requirements for the major or concentration coursework ( i.e., the school or program may identify multiple learning experiences that address a domain \u2014 the domains listed below do not each require a single designated course). 1) Provide a matrix, in the format of Template D10 -1, which indicates the courses/experience(s) that ensure that students are exposed to each of the domains indicated. Template D10 -1 requires the school or program to identify the learning experiences that introduce and reinforce each domain. Include a footnote with the template that provides the school or program's definition of \"introduced\" and \"covered.\" See Template D10-1 for the foundational domains specified for this criterion. The criterion is addressed through major core coursework offered by the College of Public Health . Note: \"Introduced\" means that the instructor has presented a domain area either through a lecture, reading, video, or other source. This is in contrast to the more involved \"covered\". Covered domains are reinforced through classroom discussion and othe r learning and assessment activities. In addition to the major coursework offered by our College, public health students complete two courses from departments outside the College of Public Health (1) PSIO 201 Anatomy & Physiology or PSIO 380 or Fundamen tals of Human Physiology; and (2) ENGL 307 Technical Writing or ENGL 308 Business Writing. These cours es are not included in the Template D10-1 as the domains are not included on the syllabi since they are not public health courses. However, the PSIO cours e options provide public health students additional learning opportunities on domain Human Health (including science of human health and disease, health promotion, and health protection). Similarly, the ENGL course provide public health students additional learning opportunities on domain Health Communications (including technical writing, professional writing, use of mass media, and use of electronic technology). 175 Template D10 -1 Syllabi for all courses listed in this table are in ERF D10.

The experience gives students a chance to narrow down their post - graduation career goals, gain experience in the field, and begin their professional networking, in addition to integrate, synthesi ze and apply knowledge gained in the classroom. Support for finding and securing internships is offered online and in -person by the Internship Director (a faculty member in Health Promotion Sciences), the College's 100% Engagement Coordinator, and broad advertisement by staff in the Office of Student Services. Before the internship field work begins, each student must submit a formal work plan for the internship experience including learning objectives. The Internship Director, in collaboration with the a gency preceptor, monitors the student internship experience. Feedback is provided half -way and at the end of the internship via evaluations completed by 189 the site preceptor. The student's final grade is assigned by the Internship Director, based on the student's performance on course assignments, the preceptor's evaluations, and the student's fulfillment of the stated learning objectives. The assignments include reflection reports, activity logs, D2L discussions, and professional development tool assignments (e.g., LinkedIn profile and ePortfolios). Public health students report that they really value the internship experience and appreciate the opportunity to contribute to projects in primarily low -income populations related to nutrition, mental health, ph ysical activity, access to healthcare, maternal and child health, substance abuse, infectious disease, injury and violence prevention, environmental health, and responsible sexual behavior, and more. The College also offers many learning opportunities tha t allow for active student engagement beyond the traditional classroom and internship setting. These include elective service learning courses, including HPS 497E \"Public Health for and in Cancer Prevention in the Community Setting\". These field -based models immerse students, faculty and community partners directly in communities and schools to implement programs that directly support community efforts to address health disparities. Each service activity is structured around reflection questions which provide the framework for understanding the role of public health in the elimination of health disparities. Students can also engage in preceptorships, independent studies, and directed res earch credits with faculty. Work -study opportunities also exist within MEZCOPH, including opportunities to work in the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs, Office of Academic Affairs, Departments of Health Promotion Sciences, Epidemiology and Bio statistics, and Community, Environment and Policy, Additionally, MEZCOPH faculty lead three to ten-week summer study abroad programs in China, Peru, Tanzania, and Western Europe.

Students who want to use a previous course to substitute for a specific UA course must provide a copy of the syllabus for the course that was already taken. It must include the textbook used, a list of topics covered each week, the number of lecture hours per week, the number of lab hours each week (if applicable), and the topics covered in the lab each week. Additionally, MEZCOPH faculty members also approve courses that are being used to substitute a MEZCOPH course. 4) If applicable, provide articulation agreements with community colleges that address acceptance of coursework. The UA uses the Arizona Course Equivalency Tracking System ( ACETS ) to move courses from the Arizona supported community colleges. ACETS is a web -based application that tracks course equivalency decisions, including Shared Unique Numbered (S UN) courses, as the courses move through the statewide evaluation and articulatio n process. ACETS supports all decision -making required to establish equivalencies in Arizona beginning with the initial request for an equivalency evaluation and ending with the creation of a report to be used by Arizona university encoders. ACETS tracks t he timeframe for course equivalency from source institution to target institution and triggers a report to target institutions when timelines are outside normal boundaries. A target school records its decision in ACETS within 45 days and encodes it within 15 days. Institutions can check recent information activity by querying the database. Additionally, the ACETS includes an application for institutions to identify any changes they make to Exam Equivalency Guide. AZTransfer staff review these changes and make the appropriate changes .

All students are required to take EHS 585 Public Health Fundamentals for Researchers which is a 3-unit course. Additionally , all students take BIOS 576A Biostatistics in Public Health which is another 3-unit course. Health Behavior Health Promotion students also take the 3 -unit course HPS 607 Qualitative Research Methods in Public Health. Additionally, all students are required to conduct a thesis that employs public health research methods for their area of study. See ERF D17. 5) Briefly summarize policies and procedures relating to production and assessment of the final research project or paper . All students in an academic master 's degree program are required to complete a thesis. Although the policies and procedures related to the thesis are similar for each program, an explanation for the nuances between is provided below. Biostatistics A thesis is required for the MS degree. The content of the MS thesis is flexible, but it must be more substantial than a standard statistical analysis. Examples of possible topics include: a simulation study to investigate a statistical method; a complex d ata analysis involving a comparison of different approaches; or an extension or novel use of an existing statistical method. It cannot be an analysis performed for a class, although this might serve as a minor portion of the thesis. Prior to initiating the research for the thesis, the student must submit a \"prospectus\" to their Thesis Committee, outlining the student's academic progress to date, studies to be completed prior to writing the thesis and an outline of the research to be included in the thesis. The student then meets with the Thesis Committee to discuss the prospectus and to formulate any new plans deemed appropriate. Epidemiology A thesis is required for the MS degree. Prior to initiating the research for the thesis, the student must submit a \"prospectus\" (< 5 pages) outlining the proposed research/thesis topic to their Thesis Committee. They should also outline her or his academic progress to date, and courses to be completed prior to writing the thesis. The student then meets with the Thesis Committee to discuss the prospectus and to formulate any new plans deemed appropriate. Environmental Health Sciences The thesis is undertaken after the first year of coursework. The student selects a mentor, writes a one - page document describing the prop osed research, and identifies a three - person Thesis Committee. The committee meets with the student and examines the plan of study making recommendations regarding course work and discusses the one -page proposal with the student. The committee meeting occ urs near the end of the second semester in the program. The scope of the hypothesis driven proposed research will be narrower than that for a PhD dissertation. In the final semester, the student must circulate a written draft of the thesis: first it must b e approved by the major advisor. When the Thesis Director considers the thesis sufficiently complete, the student submits a draft copy to Thesis Committee at least one month prior to the proposed defense date. The student makes all required changes with re peated reviews if required. Once the written draft is approved by the director and the committee, the student presents the thesis in a public forum. A defense of the thesis by the research committee follows the presentation. It is expected that the finding s of the thesis project will be publishable in a peer -reviewed journal in the student's area of research. Health Behavior Health Promotion A thesis is required for the MSPH degree. Prior to initiating the research for the thesis, the student must submit a one page written \"prospectus\" to their Thesis Committee outlining the approach to be taken, the methodology to be used, additional expertise that the student must develop to execute the project, the expected results and the source of project funding if required. The student then meets with the Thesis Committee to discuss the prospectus and to formulate any additional plans the committee deems appropriate, such as subsequent committee meeting with a more detailed research plan (e.g., introduction and meth ods). 222 The thesis is typically undertaken after the first year of coursework. The student will have a thesis adviser or mentor for this project, agreed to by the student and faculty mentor. As described the student writes a one -page document describing th e proposed research, and with the mentor identifies a three - person Thesis Committee. The scope of the rigorous proposed research, typically with a goal of leading to a peer -reviewed publication, will be narrower than that for a PhD dissertation (see the \"D issertation\" section above for further distinction). In the final semester, the student must circulate a written draft of the thesis. First it must be approved by the major advisor. When the Thesis Director considers the thesis sufficiently complete, the student submits a draft copy to Thesis Committee at least one month prior to the proposed defense date. The student makes all required changes with repeated reviews if required. Once the written draft is approved by the director and the committee, the stu dent presents the thesis in a public forum. A defense of the thesis by the research committee follows the presentation. It is expected that the findings of the thesis project will be publishable in a peer -reviewed journal in the student's area of research. Human Subjects For all degrees, if work included in the thesis involves human subjects, even if it involves secondary data analysis, the student must have IRB or college approval/exemption before starting on this work. It is the responsibility of the st udent in consultation with the Thesis Director to obtain the approvals, and conform to ethical research standards. See the \"Human Subjects Approval for Dissertation/Thesis Projects\" section above for more information on the Human Subjects approval process. Preparation of the written thesis follows the Graduate College guidelines. 6) Provide links to handbooks or webpages that contain the full list of policies and procedures governing production and assessment of the final research project or paper for each d egree school. The student handbooks that lay out the policies and procedures governing the academic public health degrees are provided in ERF D17.1 . 7) Include completed, graded samples of deliverables associated with the major paper or project. The school must provide at least 10% of the number produced in the last three years or five examples, whichever is greater. See ERF D17. 2 for five MS theses. 8) Briefly explain how the school ensures that the instruction and assessment in basic public health knowledge is generally equivalent to the instruction and assessment typically associated with a three -semester -credit course. All students in an academic master degree public health degree program are required to take the 3 -unit course EHS 585 Public Health Fundamentals for Researchers. This course addresses and assesses students on the 12 identified areas regarding basic public health knowledge. The syllabus for this course is in ERF D17.3.2 . 9) Include the most recent syllabus for any course listed in the documentation requests above, or written guidelines for any required elements that do not have a syllabus. Courses identified above are in the ERF D17.3 10) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 223 D18. ACADEMIC PUBLIC HEALTH DOCTORAL DEGREES 224 D18. Academic Public Health Doctoral Degrees These students also complete coursework and other experiences, outside of the major paper or project, that substantively address scientific and analytic approaches to discovery and translation of public health knowledge in the context of a population healt h framework. These students complete doctoral -level, advanced coursework and other experiences that distinguish the school of study from a master's degree in the same field. The school defines appropriate policies for advancement to candidacy, within t he context of the institution. Finally, students complete coursework that provides instruction in the foundational public health knowledge at an appropriate level of complexity. This instruction may be delivered through online, in - person or blended methodologies, but it must meet the following requirements while covering the defined content areas. The school identifies at least one required asse ssment activity for each of the foundational public health learning objectives. The school validates academic doctoral students' foundational public health knowledge through appropriate methods. 1) List the curricular requirements for each non -DrPH doctoral degree in the unit of accreditation, EXCLUDING requirements associated with the final resea rch project. The list must indicate (using shading) each required curricular element that a) is designed expressly for doctoral, rather than master's, students or b) would not typically be associated with completion of a master's degree in the same area of study. The school may present accompanying narrative to provide context and information that aids reviewers' understanding of the ways in which doctoral study is distinguished from master's -level study. This narrative is especially important for institut ions that do not formally distinguish master's -level courses from doctoral -level courses. The school will present a separate list for each degree program and concentration as appropriate.

EPID 573C Course Project: In the course project, students will select an appropriate study design using causal inference principles for testing hypot heses in specific populations, after evaluating specific design advantages and limitations. EPID 670 Project 4: Research Proposal and Presentation - Students write an NIH -style Specific Aims page and create a 15 - minute presentation on a research proposa l for a chronic disease epidemiology study. Students must critique the current literature on their topic and discuss strengths and limitations of their proposed study. The proposed study must include hypotheses appropriate for specific populations. As par t of the dissertation proposal students must outline the methods that will be used for their research. While some individuals may end up changing the details of their proposed work once they have advanced to candidacy all PhD students will need to carry ou t original research. This could include the design and execution of primary data collection but could also include the design and execution of secondary data analyses. Both would include study design elements. 236 Template D18 -2.3 Assessment of Competencies for PhD Epidemiology Competency Course number(s) and name(s) Describe specific assessment opportunity 4.

EPID 573B Assessment is via Assignment 6 to describing biases within study designs by comparing the advantages of biases avoided by some designs, then apply to designing study. They then evaluate the limitation of data and making inferences within the analyses of confounding and effect modification by considering how their assigned main exposure is related to other factors measured. Students are required to conduct their own original research which includes an analysis of primary or secondary data. Strengths and limitations of the dataset are included in the dissertation as well as subsequent manuscripts. 5. Lead group interactions competently, ethically, respectfully and professionally to diverse audiences. EPID 573C Advanced Epidemiology EPID 660 Infectious Disease Epidemiology EPID 573C Course Project: In the course project, students will select an appropriate study design and data analysis plan for testing hypotheses in specific populations, after evaluating the integrity, comparability and limitations of the data in making references related to analyses and results. Midterm: Students will read a published epidemiological research paper and evaluate the integrity, comparability and limitations of the data to make inferences related to analyses and results. EPID 660 Weekly dis cussions and discussion leader reflections: Students will lead discussion groups twice during the semester. All students in the class will post questions in response to the readings assigned; one applied reading (typically an outbreak investigation) and on e research study reading. Student leaders aggregate these questions and must discuss at least two of the STROBE criteria during their weekly discussion groups. They then write a short reflection summarizing the discussion with their peers. 237 Template D18 -2.3 Assessment of Competencies for PhD Epidemiology Competency Course number(s) and name(s) Describe specific assessment opportunity 6. Organize and deliver clear presentations of research findings in varying professional formats to diverse audiences. EPID 573C Advanced Epidemiology EPID 660 Infectious Disease Epidemiology EPID 670 Chronic Disease Epidemiology EPID 573C Course Project: In the course project, students will write an abstract, give an oral presentation in class and write a final paper to interpret the epidemiological analyses. They will organize and deliver the presentations in different professional formats to div erse audiences. EPID 660 Final presentation: In the last two class sessions students present the findings of their rapid review which summarizes the evidence in the epidemiological literature. EPID 670 Project 1: Presentation on Classical Chronic Disease Studies - Students will prepare a 10 -minute presentation describing an epidemiologic study of chronic disease and summarizing key epidemiologic findings from this study. Project 4: Research Proposal and Presentation - Students write an NIH-style Specific A ims page and create a 15 -minute presentation on a research proposal for a chronic disease epidemiology study. All students are required to prepare and present their dissertation work for an audience that includes both academics and membe rs of the public. This is a one -hour seminar that is guided by the committee chair to be accessible to individuals from multiple backgrounds. 238 Template 18-2.4 Assessment of Competencies for PhD in Health Behavior Health Promotion Competency Course number(s) and name(s) Describe specific assessment opportunity 1.

HPS 620A Advanced Research Methods in Health Promotion I HPS 620B Advanced Research Methods in Health Promotion II; HPS 620A: A student's final course product is assessed on how well it applies Health Behavior Health Promotion theories and frameworks in the Specific Aims and Significance sections of a grant proposal. HPS 620B: A student's final grant proposal is asses sed on how uses HBHP foundations to plan a complete and executable research project. A dissertation is required of 2 -3 completed research projects using HBHP foundational theory and methods. 239 4) Identify required coursework and other experiences that address the variety of public health research methods employed in the context of a population health framework to foster discovery and translation of public health knowledge and a brief narrative that explains how the instruction and assessment is equivalent to that typically associated with a three -semester -credit course. All students are required to take EHS 585 Public Health Fundamentals for Researchers which is a 3-unit course. Additionally, all students take BIOS 576A Biostatistics in Public Health which is another 3-unit course. Health Behavior Health Promotion students also take the 3 -unit course HPS 607 Qualitative Research Methods in Public Health. All have to do research dissertation . 5) Briefly summarize policies and procedures relating to production and assessment of the final research project or paper. All students in an academic master 's degree program are required to complete a doctoral level dissertation. Although the policies and procedures related to the dissertations are similar for each program, an explanation for the nuances between is provided below. Biostatistics The PhD dissertation should involve original research in biostatistics methodology and should represent a substa ntial contribution to the field of biostatistics. If the research involves human subjects, even if it involves secondary data analysis, the student must have IRB approval before starting on this work. It is the responsibility of the student in consultation with the Dissertation Research Director to obtain the approvals. See the \"Human Subjects Protection Program\" section above for more details of the approval process. The Biostatistics program faculty currently approves two dissertation formats: a standar d dissertation or a three -paper format. The Dissertation Committee must approve the format of the dissertation prior to the student beginning the work. Actual preparation of the written dissertation follows the Graduate College guidelines. It is recommen ded that the student work with the Dissertation Committee to determine a communication plan and timetable for reviewing dissertation work. When the student and Dissertation Research Director consider the dissertation sufficiently complete, the student subm its a complete copy of the penultimate draft to each Dissertation Committee member and negotiates a date for the oral defense with the Dissertation Committee members. This document should be submitted to the dissertation committee members at least one mont h prior to the agreed upon date of the final examination. Environmental Health Sciences The PhD dissertation should involve innovative original research and demonstrate a sophisticated command of environmental health sciences literature and skills. If the dissertation research involves human subjects, even if it involves secondary data analys is, the student must have IRB approval before starting on this work. It is the responsibility of the student, in consultation with the Dissertation Director, to obtain the approvals and conform to ethical research standards. See the \"Human Subjects Approva l Process for Dissertation/Thesis Projects\" section above for more information on the Human Subjects approval process. The Environmental Health Sciences program faculty currently approves two dissertation formats: a standard dissertation or a three -paper format. The student's Graduate Committee must approve the format of the dissertation prior to the initiation of work and this should be noted on the proposal abstract signed by the committee. Actual preparation of the written dissertation follows the Graduate College rules. See the 'Dissertation and Thesis Formatting Guides' on the Graduate College website. It is recommen ded that the student work with the Dissertation Committee to determine a communication plan and timetable for reviewing dissertation work. When the student and Dissertation Director consider the dissertation sufficiently complete, the student submits a com plete copy of the draft to each Dissertation Committee member and negotiates a date for the oral defense with the Dissertation Committee members. This document should be submitted to the Dissertation Committee members at least one month prior to the agreed upon date of the final examination. 240 Epidemiology The PhD dissertation should involve innovative research and demonstrate a sophisticated command of epidemiologic skills. If the research involves human subjects, even if it involves secondary data analys is, the student must have IRB approval before starting on this work. It is the responsibility of the student, in consultation with the Dissertation Director, to obtain the approvals and conform to ethical research standards. See the \"Human Subjects Approva l for Dissertation/Thesis Projects\" section above for more information about the Human Subjects approval process. The Epidemiology program faculty currently approves two dissertation formats: a standard dissertation or a three -paper format. The Graduate Committee must approve the format of the dissertation prior to the student beginning the work. Actual preparation of the written dissertation follows the Graduate College guidelines. While the Dissertation Director will work closely with the student, the committee should also consider reviewing drafts of the dissertation as it moves forward to avoid problems at the oral defense. It is recommended that the student work with the Dissertation Committee to determine a communication plan and timetable for revi ewing dissertation work. Students should expect to give each dissertation committee member at least 2 weeks to read each draft. When the student and Dissertation Director consider the dissertation complete, the student submits a copy of the penultimate dra ft to each Dissertation Committee member and negotiates a date for the oral defense with the Dissertation Committee members. This document should be submitted to the dissertation committee members at least one month prior to the agreed upon date of the fin al examination. Health Behavior Health Promotion The PhD dissertation should involve innovative, high impact research and demonstrate a sophisticated command of skills and knowledge relevant to Health Behavior Health Promotion . If the research involves human subjects, even if it involves secondary data analysis, the student must have IRB approval before starting this work. It is the responsibility of the student, in consultation with the Graduate Committee Chair and the COPH Re search Advisory Committee, to obtain the approvals and conform to ethical research standards. See the \"Human Subjects Approval for Dissertation/Thesis Projects\" section above for more information about the Human Subjects approval process. The HBHP progra m faculty currently supports the three peer -reviewed manuscript dissertation format. The Graduate Committee must approve the format of the dissertation prior to the student beginning the work. Students should follow dissertation formatting guidelines by th e Graduate College. While the Graduate Committee Chair will work closely with the student, the committee should be approving the dissertation as it moves forward to avoid problems at the oral defense. Based on prior deliberations of the dissertation rese arch proposal and consideration of the consistency of the committee membership across the stages of the dissertation research development, the chair may request a committee meeting to further refine the expected components of the dissertation early in the student's candidacy. It is expected that each dissertation committee member will review and approve multiple drafts of the dissertation after the Chair or Dissertation Research Director has worked with the student. It is recommended that the student work w ith the Dissertation Committee members to determine a communication plan and timetable for reviewing dissertation work. Students should expect to give each dissertation committee member at least 2 weeks to read each draft. When the student and Chair consid er the dissertation complete, the student submits a copy of the penultimate draft to each committee member and negotiates a date for the oral defense with the Dissertation Committee members. This document should be submitted to the dissertation committee m embers at least one month prior to the agreed upon date of the final examination. Consistent Policies and Outcomes For all PhD Programs No later than 15 working days before the proposed dissertation defense date, the student (with approval from the Gradu ate Committee Chair) must work with the Doctoral/MS Programs Coordinator to 1) reserve a MEZCOPH classroom for the tentatively scheduled examination, and 2) publicize the public forum presentation portion of the examination. The exact time, date, and place of this examination must also be scheduled with the Graduate College. The Graduate College notification occurs when the student submits the Doctoral Announcement of Final Oral Defense form. This form is found on the UAccess Student Center under the GradPa th option. Each semester has official Graduate College 241 deadlines related to the dissertation defense and eligibility for that same semester graduation. Visit the Graduate College website for specific semester deadlines. Formal oral defense of the dissert ation research constitutes the final examination. This consists of a public seminar by the candidate of no more than 50 minutes plus 10 minutes for questions from the general audience, followed by a closed oral examination by the candidate's Dissertation C ommittee. The entire exam must be completed within three hours. It is expected that the student will meet with the Graduate Committee Chair and possibly other committee members to discuss the content of the public seminar and review the power -point present ation at least 14 days prior to the scheduled presentation. The student must take the final draft of the dissertation and three printed Approval Pages to the final defense for the Dissertation Committee members to sign. The student needs to assure that all Dissertation Committee members can attend the final examination. The student also must inform the HBHP Program Director and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. Members of the Graduate Committee from the minor depar tment have the option to attend or not. The Graduate Committee Chair presides over the examination. The initial seminar portion is open to the public; the remaining examination portion is closed to the public. Possible Outcomes: The Dissertation Committe e determines the Final Oral Dissertation Defense outcome as: Pass, no revisions of the dissertation required. This option is rarely awarded. Pass, with revisions that must be approved by the Graduate Committee Chair. This option is used most often in the experience of the faculty. Pass, with revisions that must be approved by all Dissertation Committee members. Fail. The Dissertation Committee then decides if a request for re -examination will be submitted to the Graduate College. The Graduate College Dean approves/disapproves the request. The Graduate Committee Chair submits the defense results to the Graduate College. When revisions are required, the student is responsible for meeting with the Graduate Com mittee Chair to work out a timeline for completion and review of the revisions. 6) Provide links to handbooks or webpages that contain the full list of policies and procedures governing production and assessment of the final research project or paper for eac h degree school. SEE ERF D17.1 for the policies and procedures for each academic public health PhD program. 7) Include completed, graded samples of deliverables associated with the advanced research project. The school must provide at least 10% of the number produced in the last three years or five examples, whichever is greater . See ERF D18 for five PhD dissertation s. These dissertations are from Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences, Epidemiology and Health Behavior Health Promotion students. 8) Briefly explain how the school ensures that the instruction and assessment in introductory public health knowledge is generally equivalent to the instruction and assessment typically associated with a three semester -credit course. All students in an academic doctoral degree program are required to take the 3 -unit course EHS 585 Public Health Fundamentals for Researchers. This course addresses and assesses students on the 12 identified areas regarding basic public health knowledge. The syllabus for this course is in ERF D17.3.2. 9) Include the most recent syllabus for any course listed in the documentation requests above, or written guidelines for any required elements that do not have a syllabus. See ERF D18. 1 for the syllabus and assessment tools for the academic public health doctoral degrees that include EHS 585 Public Health Fundamentals for Researchers (ERF D17.3.2 ). 242 D19. ALL REMAINING DEGREES 243 D19. All Remaining Degrees Not Applicable . 244 D20. DISTANCE EDUCATION 245 D20. Dis tance Education The university provides needed support for the school, including administrative, communication, information technology and student services. There is an ongoing effort to evaluate the academic effectiveness of the format, to assess learning methods and to systematically use this information to stimulate school improvements. Evaluation of student outcomes and of the learning model are especially important in institutions that offer distance learning but do not offer a comparable in-residence school. 1) Identify all public health distance education degree programs and/or concentrations that offer a curriculum or course of study that can be obtained via distance education. Template Intro -1 may be referenced for this purpose. Online Master of Public Health (MPH) with the following concentrations: Applied Epidemiology Health Promotion Health Services Administration Bachelor of Science with a major in Public Health with the following emphasis options: Public Health Practice Health Systems in Theory and Practice Global Health 2) Describe the public health distance education programs, including a) an explanati on of the model or methods used The online MPH employs a carousel model built using UA's MPH curriculum that allows students to enter program at the start of each semester. The first carousel consists of 6 required courses; the second carousel consists of require concentration courses, the applied practice experience and in integrated public heath course. The MPH degree requirements with specializations total 42 credit units. The model assumes program design that supports a working professional audience while preserving UA's high academic standards. The semester structure includes the following: Students take two courses consecutively during a 15-week semester; each course is 7.5 week s and identified as a Term A and Term B course. A dedicated Internship Workshop between core and specialization concentration carousel of courses. Students are able to take their integrated public health course their last fall or spring semester in the program. They conduct their internship (applied practice experience during their last 15-week semester. Students in our online program also are able to work closely with individual faculty members. Two examples are the following: (1) one of our online MPH faculty Dr. Abdul Saljuqi was approached by a student (who also works as Clinical Research Manager in the Department of Surgery, College of Medicine in Tucson) to become her internship Preceptor for the academic year of 2019 -2020. The student attended Dr. Saljuqi 's class this Summer, but in a different section. Based on their agreement, the student works with Fall Prevention Institute research activities. The focus of the student internship research will be assessing the discharge disposition for fall patients from Banner UMC - Tucson and to find out how patients are directed to available fall prevention programs (e.g. A Matter of Balance). The final aim of the study is to propose a policy in which the healthcare providers are required to have a clear and specific guideline for fall victims to attend CDC approved fall prevention programs after discharge and to prevent secondary falls and readmissions. (2) Another MPH student reached out to Dr. Gonzalez to work with him and the Primary Prevention Mobile Unit to become a volunteer. This student participated with us in some of our mobile unit events, providing basic health screenings, and health education to the community in areas as Guadalupe, Mesa and Downtown Phoenix. She was very interested to learn how to work with the community; at the end, she was very enthusiastic about community health and the mobile unit approach. 246 The online BS is identical in degree requiremen ts to the main campus/in -person degree, with the exception of offering three emphasis options compared with five emphasis options for on campus students . The education model assumes program design that supports a distance -based audience while preserving UA's high academic standards. Support for curriculum design is provided by the University's Arizona Online and Office of Digital Learning teams. The online program also reviews and supports the following course work : Pre-requisite courses that transfer students have already completed are assessed for equivalency to pre-major coursework. In those cases where students have completed public health -focused coursework elsewhere, this coursework is also assessed by Public Health faculty for equivalenc y to specific coursework in the major. The only course not available at the UA to fully online students is chemistry (note: this is a course 'owned' by the Chemistry departmen t, outside of the College of Public Health). Students are advised to take this course at a community college or institution located close to them. Most of the courses are offered in 7.5-week format, which has been found to be preferred by online adult learners. b) the school's ration ale for offering these programs With continued advances in technology and the increasing aging population, the online programs serve to fulfill the need for a competent public health workforce capable of supporting the ever- changing health needs of diverse populations, domestically and abroad . Further, offering the MPH and BS via the online classroom increases access to quality accredited public health education. Arizona also has a strong community college system and two tribal community colleges. The online program allows students and avenue to continue their education to obtain the bachelor degree in public health. The College's online degree programs have served in retaining students, who would otherwise not be able to pursue our degrees, thus increasing the likelihood of fulfilling their educational and professional goals and ensuring a competent public health workforce. For example, of the original cohort of graduating online undergraduate students, all five students had begun the degree on main campus, and for a variety of reasons, they changed campuses. The ease of being able to do so has directly contributed to greater retention and graduation rates within the College. c) the manner in which it provides necessary administrative, information technolo gy and student support services The college has a director for the online MPH program and a student support advisor. They work directly with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and the Assistant Dean for Student Services to oversee the implementation of the program . The online MPH receives also receives administrative support from a third-party provider (Pearson ) in the following areas: recruitment/marketing, course development, and student support services. Our partnership with Pearson also provides the following support staff: Student Success Coach, Instructional Designers, and Student Retention Manager. The Online BS has one College of Public Health academic advisor dedicated to the fully online student body, from recruitment through admission and onto graduation. The academic advisor receives training and support from the Coordinator of Undergraduate Advising and participates in ongoing professional development trainings by the University Advising Resource Center and the University's UAONLINE Office that is led by a Senior Vice Provost and Vice President Academic Initiatives and Student Success . The a dministrative support from this office and the Office of Digital Learning includes recruitment/marketing and course design. d) the manner in which it monitors the academic rigor of the programs and their equivalence (or comparability) to other degree programs offered by the university, and The College maintains academic rigor in the online programs by offering courses developed by the College's full -time faculty members and employing a number of plagiarism prevention tools (i.e. 247 Turnitin, Exam ity, etc.) to maintain academic integrity. Competencies addressed are the same as the on-campus courses, reviews are done, and student progress is also monitore d, e) the manner in which it evaluates the educational outcomes, as well as the format and methods. The MPH program assesses educational outcomes three times during matriculation: Annual Progress Report, Exit Survey, and the Teacher -Course Evaluation system. The BS program students also participate in Exit Surveys and Teacher -Course Evaluation systems. MPH students are required to complete an Annual Progress Report as a component of the Mandatory MPH Internship Workshop. The Annual Progress Report describes their progress and accomplishments for the previous academic year. At the end of matriculation, graduate students complete an exit survey that measures their confidence in the attained MPH Learning Outcomes, CEPH Competencies, and MPH concentration competencies. The exit survey for undergraduate students measures the students' confidence in the attained Learning outcomes and CEPH domains, competencies, and cross - cutting concepts. The Teacher -Course Evaluation system (TCE) is the University of Arizona's centrally -supported service for collecting end of term feedback from students about UA courses and faculty. The UA TCE aims to: provide students with a venue to voice their views about UA courses for the benefit of the UA community and as a source of information students can consider when selecting courses. provide faculty and their departments with a consistent source of valid and reliable student feedback for use in faculty performance appraisal processes such as Annual Review and Promotion and Tenure Reviews. offer UA faculty and teaching assistants optional detailed feedb ack information for teaching skills and course development offer academic departments and the UA administration ongoing data regarding student satisfaction and the student experience in UA courses for planning and decision support as well as evidence in a variety of accreditation and other accountability processes . 3) Describe the processes that the university uses to verify that the student who registers in a distance education course (as part of a distance -based degree) or a fully distance -based degree is the same student who participates in and completes the course or degree and receives the academic credit. The University Information Technology Services (UITS) recent incorporation of Duo authentication for the Student Information System and for D2L serves as enhanced authentication for persons logging into university systems. Additionally, the use of plagiarism prevention EdTech tools (i.e. Examity ) help ensure the person on the other end is who they say they are. 4) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 248 E1. FACULTY ALIGNMENT WITH DEGREES OFFERED 249 E1. Faculty Alignment with Degrees Offered Faculty teach and supervise students in areas of knowledge with which they are thoroughly familiar and qualified by the total ity of their education and experience.

Integration of Faculty with Practice Experience To assure a broad public health perspective, the school employs faculty who have professional experience in settings outside of academia and have demonstrated competence in public health practice. Schools encourage faculty to main tain ongoing practice links with public health agencies, especially at state and local levels. To assure the relevance of curricula and individual learning experiences to current and future practice needs and opportunities, schools regularly involve public health practitioners and other individuals involved in public health work through arrangements that may include adjunct and part -time faculty appointments, guest lectures, involvement in committee work, mentoring students, etc. 1) Describe the manner in which the public health faculty complement integrates perspectives from the field of practice, including information on appointment tracks for practitioners, if applicable. Faculty with significant practice experience outside of that which is ty pically associated with an academic career should also be identified. Table E1 provides examples for which faculty have been and are currently involved with practice. These practice experiences include both full -time work and collaborating with federal, tribal, state and county health departments and agencies, non -profit organizatio ns, international organizations, and community action groups among others. We use the criterion that any non -academic work with public health organizations that is service and practice oriented is essential for having faculty bring in practice experience into the classroom especially when it is not solely focused on research. In addition to these faculty practice exper iences and activities, Table E1 -2 identi fies that many of our current non -primary instructional faculty members are currently working as pu blic health practitioners . These part -time instructors also bring their knowledge and experiences into the classrooms. There is a clear connection between of faculty's practice experience with their research interests which involves students and the subjects and lectures that are presented to students. Additionally, these experiences with our practice colleagues have led to developing our academic health department with Pima County which has practitioners and faculty members working together on joint proj ects and presentations inside and outside of the classroom. The faculty also use their practice experience to help guide students when the develop and implement their applied practice experiences via their internships and dissertation work. Table E1.

Faculty Instructional Effectiveness The school ensures that systems, policies and procedures are in place to document that all faculty (full-time and part -time) are current in their areas of instructional responsibility and in pedagogical methods. The school establishes and consistently ap plies procedures for evaluating faculty competence and performance in instruction. The school supports professional development and advancement in instructional effectiveness. 1) Describe the means through which the school ensures that faculty are informed and maintain currency in their areas of instructional responsibility. The description must address both primary instructional and non -primary instructional faculty and should provide examples as relevant. Support of instruction is initiated with the letters of offer that are given to all new faculty members. These letters indicate the amount of teaching that is required as part of their appointment within the college. Additionally , we have a college pol icy that clearly indicates the compensation that faculty members receive for teaching. The policy is provided in the ERF E3. The policy covers teaching regular on campus courses, courses for our online MPH program and courses for our online undergraduate program. All faculty members are expected to attend professional meetings within their area of research and teaching, pub lish scholarly work related to the area of study and attend workshops on pedagogy that are related to their instructional responsibilities. These activities are reported each year during their annual performance evaluations. Our faculty also have an acti ve research portfolio from competitive extramural funding. Staying current in their field of research and bringing this research into the classroom is an area that ensures that faculty are staying current in the topic matters related to their instructional responsibilities. Our faculty are also active within their professional organizations and provide high level consultation to various academic and professional institutions. For example, faculty members attend the annual meetings of the American Public Health Association, the American Statistical Association, etc. Dr. Beamer is the president of the International Society of Exposure Science. The society promotes and advances exposure science as it relates to the complex inter -relationships between human p opulations, communities, ecosystems, wildlife, and chemical, biological, and physical agents, and non -chemical stressors. Dr. Lynn Gerald, our C anyon Ranch Endowed Chair and professor of health promotion sciences is a member of the National Institutes of Health National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Thoracic Society for her asthma research. Dr. Taren is the Editor -in-Chief for Nutrition Reviews , a highly cited (Impact Factor 5.788) , monthly, international, peer - reviewed journal that specializes in the publication of authoritative and critical literature reviews on current and emerging topics in nutrition science, food science, clinical nutrition, and nutrition policy. Examples of non -primary instructional faculty members who maintain currency in their areas of instruction include Chris Cutshaw is who is the Director of Health and Public Policy for the United Way of Tucson and Southern Arizona and Dr. Burris D uncan is the Founder of ASORBO in Nogales, Mexico. \"ARSOBO assists in alleviating the physical, psychological, and economic barriers faced by individuals with disabilities by providing appropriate, adaptive -technology, low -cost, assisted devices that impr ove access and participation in their communities.\" ARSOBO has developed Cross Border Public Private Partnerships & Networks to support its mission and vision. It manufactures all terrain wheelchairs, prosthetics and orthotics and supports hearing health by providing solar -powered hearing aids. The college has now developed a series of workshops. These workshops are part of our college -wide retreat. In May 2019 it focused on team teaching. In August 2019, we had 2 workshops prior to the start of the semester as we prepared to start teaching in our new Health Sciences Innovation Building (HSIB). These two workshops focused on what is needed to have strong group projects and t eaching within a collaborative learning space. Workshop are now planned each semester for our faculty. At the same time, 270 our University's Office of Instruction and Assessment provides numerous workshop and training opportunities for faculty members. 2) Describe the school's procedures for evaluating faculty instructional effectiveness. Include a description of the processes used for student course evaluations and peer evaluations, if applicable. Instructional effectiveness is conducted with teaching co urse evaluations (TCEs) that are administered by the University Office of Instruction and Assessment, peer review of individual courses, during annual performance evaluations, personal statements during the promotion and tenure process, and via nominations for outstanding teaching awards. TCEs are online evaluations. Students anonymously complete the evaluations at the end of each course and faculty receive the results after grades are submitted. The evaluations include questions using a Likert Scale abo ut teaching effectiveness, course effectiveness, usefulness of homework and assignments , amount learned in the course, how well students were treated with respect, amount of time spent on the course compared with other courses . The results of these evalua tions are made public. College administrators are also able to see a comparative report to determine how the outcomes relate to similar courses within the University. Peer evaluations are conducted by the departments using tools designed by the Univer sity's Office of Instruction and Assessment for Course evaluations and a procedure that was pilot tested by the College's Office of Academic Affairs. The methodology is described more fully in the next section. 3) Describe available university and programm atic support for continuous improvement in faculty's instructional roles. Provide three to five examples of school involvement in or use of these resources. The description must address both primary instructional faculty and non -primary instructional facul ty. Examples: The College uses the OIA peer evaluation system for classroom observations (See ERF E3). The protocol for peer review of teaching is designed to guide UA instructors in the process of formative review of peers' teaching, as well as evaluation of teaching for summative review. The protocol includes resources for review of face -to-face and fully online courses. Formative review is used to provide feedback for professional growth and development. Our College's g uidelines for using this protocol are below. o Two faculty members do the reviews using the following steps: o Reviewers obtain the syllabus and get access to the D2L site if the course uses it. o Reviewers meet with the course instructor and discuss the course and go over the evaluati on form that was used when sitting in a class and make any modifications as appropriate given the course. (This evaluation form is from OIA.) The team may also review the past TCEs. o Each reviewer goes to one class and complete the evaluation form. o After bo th reviewers have gone to a class, write up a 1-2-page report as a team. o Meet with the faculty members and give them the report. This should be a constructive report stating the strengths and areas that could be improved with course. o Make any modifications to the report after the meeting and then send the final report to the instructor and the department head. The College uses the OIA teacher -course evaluations. As described above, TCEs are administered for each course for all faculty members . The TCEs provide scores back to the administrators and a comparative report. When a score for teaching effectiveness or for course effectiveness is below 3 (on a 1 to 5 Likert Scale), there is a discussion with the faculty member on how to improve the c ourse. The College works with others on campus and with OIA to provide workshops on pedagogy. The College has now developed a series of workshops related to teaching. These workshops have been 271 part of our college -wide retreat and as individual workshops. In May 2019 it focused on team teaching. This was led by Dr. Paul Blowers, a UA Distinguished Professor of Teaching who has developed an innovative and award -winning program in the College of Engineering. In August 2019, we had 2 workshops prior to the st art of the semester as we prepared to start teaching in our new Health Sciences Innovation Building (HSIB). These two workshops focused on what is needed to have strong group projects and teaching within a collaborative learning space. Workshop are now pl anned each semester for our faculty. At the same time, our University's Office of Instruction and Assessment (OIA) provides numerous workshop and training opportunities for faculty members. OIA supports faculty by having workshops on teaching, the use of technology, writing and learning, use of the D2L, our college's learning management system, and provides a certificate in college teaching that is available to our students and faculty. 4) Describe the role of evaluations of instructional effectiveness in d ecisions about faculty advancement. In preparation for requests for faculty advancement, the results of TCEs are now automatically incorporated into the UAVITA E system for annual performance evaluations. Thus, on a yearly basis, the teaching faculty get feedback from students and their peers regarding their instructional effectiveness. In addition to the TCEs, faculty also have the ability to provide additional nuanced outcomes regarding their effectiveness. This can include how they work with students on research and service project and on publications and other scholarly work. The evaluation of instructional effectiveness is included in each faculty members tea ching portfolio that is part of their promotion and tenure dossier. Additionally, faculty members address the observations and recommendatio ns from their peer evaluations as a method to improve their instructional effectiveness. 5) Select at least three in dicators, with one from each of the listed categories that are meaningful to the school and relate to instructional quality. Describe the school's approach and progress over the last three years for each of the chosen indicators. In addition to at least th ree from the lists in the criteria, the school may add indicators that are significant to its own mission and context. Schools should focus data and descriptions on its public health degree programs. Faculty currency External reviews of proposed or existing courses or curricula, outside of normal university processes Peer/internal review of syllabi/curricula for currency of readings, topics, methods, etc. Annual or other regular reviews of faculty productivity, relation of scholarship to instructio n Faculty maintenance of relevant professional credentials or certifications that require continuing education Faculty instructional technique Frequency of internal quality reviews of existing courses or curricula Participation in professional developme nt related to instruction Peer evaluation of teaching Student satisfaction with instructional quality School - or program -level outcomes Courses that are team -taught with i nterprofessional perspectives Courses that integrate technology in innova tive ways to enhance learning Courses that involve community -based practitioners Courses that integrate service learning, as def ined by the school or program Courses that integ rate community -based projects Courses that use higher -level assessments Courses that empl oy active learning techniques Teaching assistants trained in pedagog ical techniques Implementation of grading rubrics 272 Faculty currency Peer/internal review of syllabi/curricula for currency of readings, topics, methods, etc.: MEZCOPH takes on peer and internal review of syllabi and curricula through several mechanisms. Initial reviews occur when a new course is proposed. This review goes through department review and one is conducted by the College's Education Committee before a new course is submitted to the University. Peer review of courses also occur when faculty are undergoing their third-year review and before promotion. The process for these reviews were provided in subsection 3 above. Additional peer review of teaching may take place later too. Faculty are to respond to the how they used their peer review and this self -evaluation is part of promotion and tenure packages. Additionally, each year, public health programs are asked to review their curricula and make recommendation s for any changes that need to occur so they may be put into our Course Curriculum Guide and Student Handbook. Curriculum changes are also reviewed for how they may affect the scheduling of courses. Annual or other regular reviews of faculty productivity, relation of scholarship to instruction: MEZCOPH utilizes peer review and adminis trative review of faculty productivity on an annual basis . Faculty are required to use the university's UAVita e software to upload their accomplishments with regards to teaching, research and service. UAVita e provides a printout that is then reviewed by a department peer review committee, the department chair and dean. In addition to annual performance reviews, MEZCOPH participates in a post -tenure review process for all tenured faculty members. Post -tenure review includes reporting the outcome of annual r eviews. All tenured faculty members have successfully been reviewed through this process. Faculty instructional technique Participation in professional development related to instruction : MEZCOPH has set up a goal of having all faculty participate in a continuing education program related to pedago gy no less than once every two years. To support this goal, MEZCOPH has started to provide a series of trainings for faculty that are held within our instructio nal facilities located in Drachman Hall and the Health Sciences Innovation Building. During the past year, these programs have included 20% to 25% of the faculty and topics have included how to optimize team teaching using teaching assistants, how to use c ollaborative learning classrooms and how to better plan, implement and evaluate group work. Implementation of grading rubrics: Evaluation of DrPH Comprehensive Written Exams are conducted using a rubric based on the critical thinking domains from the F oundation for Critical Thinking based in San Francisco, California. The exams are case -based and students are required to sit for a closed book exam and to complete an open -book policy brief. Student satisfaction with instructional quality : Table E2 provides data on student satisfaction with instructional quality based on teaching -course evaluations that are conducted with students at the end of the semester for each course. The table addresses the quality of instruction for our undergraduate and graduate courses. We have focused both on having very high scores for teaching effectiveness and the overall rating of the course and also on minimizing classes with low scores on teaching effectiveness and course ratings. As can be seen from the ta ble, very few MEZCOPH cou rses have teaching effectiveness scores of less than 3.0. However, overall courses ratings tended to score lower than teaching effectiveness scores. At the same time, 70% of all MEZCOPH courses had a very high score for teaching effectiveness for the 2018 -19 academic year but average high course ratings of were at 36% for the same year. Nonetheless, more than half of the MEZCOPH courses had greater scores than comparable courses in at the UA for both teaching effectiveness and ove rall course ratings. The scoring system is based off the following Likert Scale: Teaching effectiveness: 1 (almost never effective) to 5 (almost always effective ); Course rating: 1 (one of the worse courses) to 5 (one of the best courses). 273 Table E2 .

The MPH program , the precursor to the College, used microwave interactive television as early as 1994 to provide synchronous courses to students in Tucson, Phoenix and Flagstaff, Arizona. The College currently stays current and is an early 274 adaptor to technology for example it often uses Zoom, Panapto and other software programs to provide synchronous courses to students in various parts of Arizona and to a llow students to review courses following various lectures. Courses that involve community -based practitioners: MEZCOPH has focused on developing numerous service learning courses that actively engaged community -based practitioners. These service learning courses have students work intensely with community -based partners during a one-week period. Service learning a ctivities with community -based partners are also incorporated into lecture courses as well as being an essential part of how we ensure applied practice experiences. We also have shared our experience with service learning courses through a publication by Sabo et al in the American Journal of Public Health (See ERF E3). 6) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 275 E4. FACULTY SCHOLARSHIP 276 E4. Faculty Scholarship The school has policies and practices in place to support faculty involvement in scholarly activities. As many faculty as possible are involved in research and scholarly activity in some form, whether funded or unfunded. Ongoing participation i n research and scholarly activity ensures that faculty are relevant and current in their field of expertise, that their work is peer reviewed and that they are content experts. The types and extent of faculty research align with university and school miss ions and relate to the types of degrees offered. Faculty integrate research and scholarship with their instructional activities. Research allows faculty to bring real -world examples into the classroom to update and inspire teaching and provides opportuni ties for students to engage in research activities, if desired or appropriate for the degree program. 1) Describe the school's definition of and expectations regarding faculty research and scholarly activity. The research mission of the University requires faculty members to contribute actively to the expansion of intellectual frontiers and to participate in the creation and/or scientific application, translation, evaluation, and dissemination of new knowledge. Tenure -track faculty and faculty whose primary area of responsibility is considered to be research are generally expected to participate in applied and/or basic research and to contribute to the research activities and grant applications of other MEZCOPH faculty. Specific expectations are based on the faculty member's Annual Work Plan. In addition to faculty researchers, MEZCOPH also has academic professionals who contribute to the research mission of the College. These individuals are appointed, non -faculty employees who are involved with research, service or teaching programs, who require professional and intellectual freedom. Beyond their work on individual projects and grants, academic professionals are key to providing technical assistance and col laboration with community partners and the public health infrastructure in our state and region. The specific expectations of research, teaching and service are determined in consultation with their supervisors at the time of the development of their annu al work plan. 2) Describe available university and school support for research and scholarly activities. Support for research and scholarly activities occurs at the level of the University, the University of Arizona Health Sciences (UAHS), MEZCOPH and w ithin the departments of MEZCOPH. Faculty prepare grants with the assistance of the UAHS Research Administration Office and MEZCOPH's business office. MEZCOPH's research office fosters and supports faculty research in conjunction with the business office , Centers, and the Departments. All grants and contracts must go through multiple levels of review and approval, beginning with the Department. Proposals are then forwarded to the Dean's office for fiscal review and approval. The final level of review o ccurs at the University level with the Office of Sponsored Projects. All research projects involving human or animal subjects are reviewed by the University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) or the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and must be approved before research begins. The University's Vice President for Research (VPR) supports the College's research mission by providing 30% of start -up packages to be used for research development and expansion. Funds secured for newly hired and retained faculty are used to offset initial and ongoing costs of research personnel, operating needs, travel, equipment and renovation of laboratory space. MEZCOPH is responsible for any remaining costs to the commitment. As a result, MEZCOPH routinely looks for and often secures strategic partnerships with other colleges during candidate negotiations to better secure the hire and start -up commitment. The VPR also supports scholarly activities within MEZCOPH through the Office of Research, Discovery & In novation (RDI). RDI personnel help MEZCOPH faculty identify potential funding opportunities and will also upon request will review proposals and make recommendations for improvements. IRB and IACUC review and approval also takes place at the University l evel. 277 Development and submission of grant proposals (and development of contracts) are supported primarily by the UAHS Research Administration Office. They assist MEZCOPH faculty in the development of budgets, budget justifications and submission of proposals t o the University of Arizona Sponsored Projects and Contracting Services. Post -award support is primarily provided by the MEZCOPH business office. The Office of the Associate Dean for Research oversees MEZCOPH's research mission. The Associate Dean for Research facilitates research and serves as the liaison between the College, the IRB and IACUC, and the Office of the Vice President for Research. The Associate Dean for Research also meets regularly with other Associate Deans across campus, colleagues w ithin the community and other organizations to discuss research issues and potential collaborations. Within MEZCOPH, the Associate Dean for Research works with the Department Chairs and faculty to prioritize hiring and resources, and is responsible for mentoring individual faculty, fostering and encouraging multi -disciplinary collaborations within MEZCOPH, across the University and with the community. The Office of the Associate Dean for Research also provides review of grant proposals at the stage of specific aims development and also assistance with reorganizing unfunded proposals for resubmission in response to study section summary statements. This is done through the Research Advisory Committee (RAC), composed predominantly of seasoned faculty Prin cipal Investigators with extensive experience and funding success with grant proposals. Several College wide mechanisms for pilot research funding exist. The Dean's Fund provides travel funds and funding for seed grants for MEZCOPH faculty and students . Priority is given to grants that are focused on projects that involve community collaborations related to health promotion and that have the potential to significantly reduce the burden of chronic diseases among those disproportionately affected. Facul ty grants are expected to generate pilot data to support external grant applications. Student grants are expected to be an integral part of their dissertation. Over the last 3 years, it has supported seven activities, three dissertations, 11 internship s and publication costs. Table E3 provides details on the types of projects that have been funded.

Student: Charles Brand Internship: UNICEF Nepal Jessie Student: Lysbe th Flooden Publication in BMC Medical Research Methodology MEZCOPH's Canyon Ranch Center for Prevention and Health Promotion (CRCPHP) provides funding for pilot/feasibility (P/F) studies in the area of nutrition, physical activity, or obesity. The funds serve to stimulate research and support collaboration that will strengthen the overall mission and specific goals of the CRCPHP. The P /F studies may focus on any area of research related to nutrition, physical activity, or obesity and are designed to 1) provide initial project support for new investigators; 2) allow exploration of possible new directions for established investigators; 3) stimulate investigators from other areas of endeavor to use their expertise for nutrition/obesity research, and 4) support collaboration among academic, community, and public health stakeholders in the pursuit of addressing health disparities. In additio n to these College wide programs, there are other opportunities for pilot grant funding on campus such as the Vice President for Research's Community Connection and Faculty Seed grants and small grant opportunities from University Centers. MEZCOPH laborato ry space includes the Medical Research Building (MRB) adjacent to Drachman. The MRB is a state -of-the-art facility containing 8,218 net square feet of open, shared core facilities, wet labs, and faculty/student office space designed to maximize collaborati ve research and interaction among students and faculty. The MRB houses significant infrastructure and tools for studying industrial hygiene, indoor environmental surveillance, and biological exposure assessments. The research office space also includes a copy room with IKON copier and two conference rooms available by appointment. All MEZCOPH/CEP computers at MRB have been equipped with Ethernet and/or wireless. These computers are equipped with a wide variety of software, including Microsoft Office, Arc GIS, S -PLUS, STATA, and MATLAB. The computers are connected to a Local Area Network, which provides access to back -up servers and laser printer(s). In order to facilitate successful research in junior faculty, faculty members below the rank of Professor are required to have a mentor. The selection is usually made by the faculty member in conjunction with his or her division director. The mentor is expected to meet regularly with the faculty member and to complete 279 an assessment of progress in the faculty member's annual performance review (APR). In addition, the MEZCOPH Research Office, often in collaboration with the Research Offices from the other colleges at the UA, offers workshops and symposia for faculty and students. 3) Describe and provide three to five examples of faculty research activities and how faculty integrate research and scholarly activities and experience into their instruction of students. MEZCOPH uses several mechanisms to monitor the changing practice or research needs and uses this information to drive changes in the curriculum. First, faculty members are actively involved with research and stay current in their specific areas of expertise with publications and attendance at national and international me etings. The faculty members bring their current knowledge from these activities back to the classroom. Second, MEZCOPH faculty members have also participated on various competency workgroups within ASPH. Their involvement in the DrPH and undergraduate com petency workgroups allows information to flow back to the College about the current national thought on competencies and what is needed within the curriculum. Third, the Arizona Public Health Training Center is actively involved with assessing the training needs of the public health workforce. The training needs assessment that is developed covers what the employers believe they need to be productive and the assessments are also done with employers related to what they perceive as the training needs for the public health workforce. Specific examples of student opportunities for involvement in faculty research and scholarly activities are described below for Dr. Melanie Bell, Dr. Doug Taren, Dr. Janet Foote and Dr. Kelly Reynolds. Dr. Bell, Biostatistics Professor, teaches BIOS 576C, Applied Biostatistics Analysis in the f all semester. This is a project -based class where each of the students are required to collaborate with a researcher (often a faculty member in the College of Public Health or in the Heal th Sciences) to do an in -depth analysis on real data. This project includes meeting with the professor and their collaborator to discuss the study design and research question, writing a statistical analysis plan, giving an oral presentation, and writing a report. Several students have submitted abstracts and manuscripts with their collaborators. A list of published and in submission papers are given below: 1.

Dr. Taren has incorporated much of his research into the two international nutrition courses that he teaches. His lectures for HPS 560 International Nutrition, on vitamin A deficiency, infant feeding and mother -to-child HIV transmission (MTCT), and on food security incorporates his research in these areas from studies conducted in Nepal, Kenya, and Ethiopia, respectively. Specifically, he shows how providing low -dose vitamin A to treat night blindness through community health posts is dependent on the severity of night blindness an d the infrastructure is available. His work in Kenya illustrates the importance of exclusive breastfeeding to decrease the risk of MTCT. His work in Ethiopia illustrates how the World Food Program approaches and evaluates their humanitarian assistance. Additionally, given his extensive field work in multiple countries, he uses this experience in his HPS 416 The World's Food and Health to guide discussions about how food availability, food preparation, and culture affect individual and community nutrition status. Dr. Foote has incorporated research into three of the courses that she teaches. The PHP696V course, part of the MPH in Public Health Practice core, introduces students to research with requiring completion of the CITI ethnics training. Students work with community outreach organizations over the semester including summarizing analytics or comparing community organization experiences to local or national indices. Students summarize the data in an abstract submitted to the Annual Arizona Health Equ ity conference and usually are invited to complete a poster presentation. In EPID 573A, students review a questionnaire and learn about design considerations for questionnaires. Students are then introduced to Qualtrics - a University licensed survey softw are program. Each student builds and posts a link to a brief survey that is completed by classmates, and then each student investigator summarizes at least two key results using the back -end resources available in the Qualtrics software. Presentation of th e key results are graded to ensure that students properly annotate charts and figures while providing clear, appropriate summaries of the results being depicted. Along with being introduced to survey development foundations, students practice providing vis ual and written interpretation of findings. In HPS 478, students learn about several types of dietary assessment tools along with learning about dietary recommendations. Each student completes online food records using the ASA24 (NCI) system and then exami nes his/her own dietary intake by comparing intake summaries to recommendation levels of food groups and specific nutrients. Dr. Reynolds is the leader of the Environment, Exposure Science and Risk Assessment Center (ESRAC), located within MEZCOPH, which provides a platform for multidisciplinary research and scholarly activities among academia, industry and community partnerships. Local and global partnerships provide opportunities for students to learn about current research and participate in hands -on ap plications in field sampling for environmental contaminants and human health risk assessment modeling. Experiences and results from active ESRAC projects are incorporated into her student instruction through laboratory courses (i.e., EHS 502 Environmental Monitoring and Analysis), lectures (i.e., EHS 575 Environmental and Occupational Health; EHS 518 Introduction to Human Health Risk Assessment), independent studies tailored to student interests as well as broad spectrum training (i.e., EHS 900 Independent Study), and internship experiences (i.e., EHS 909 Internship). Real world examples and case studies from faculty and student research collaborations are utilized in her course instruction and the development of applicable skills for the field. Students are provided opportunities for hands -on training through a variety of real -world and simulated activities aligned with previous and ongoing ESRAC projects. Specific examples of ESRAC research integration into student instruction include: Exposure assessment of chemicals and microbes from targeted environments (EHS 575; 518) Use of Monte Carlo simulations to characterize health outcomes (EHS 518) Case studies in human health risk assessment (EHS 518) 281 Tracking waterborne infections using an observational and mo deled approach (EHS 575; 502; 518) Use of cultural and PCR methods in field monitoring (EHS 575; 502) Modeling healthcare risks from microbial contaminants (EHS 575; 518; 900; 909) Household hygiene monitoring and risk (EHS 900) Office wellness studies (EH S 518; 900; 909) Evaluation of PPE efficacy (EHS 900) 4) Describe and provide three to five examples of student opportunities for involvement in faculty research and scholarly activities. MEZCOPH has a successful research program that is consistent with the College's mission. Students and faculty contribute t o the knowledge base of public health disciplines, including research directed at improving the practice of public health. The College's research program actively engages community partners and collabo rators for successful community -based research. The C enters allow MEZCOPH to integrate multiple disciplines when working on public health research, service and workforce development. The College receives funding from a wide range of agencies. Students are actively involved in research and the College's sup port for student research activities is substantial. MEZCOPH faculty and appointed professionals are actively involved as PIs in research and continue to receive funding even in difficult economic times. As shown in the following table, MEZCOPH has met its goals for research (Indicators 1 -4) each of the past three years. We continue to strongly support student involvement in research and continue to work to improve this area. At MEZCOPH, students are encouraged to participate in research with faculty members in the process of discovering new knowledge, ideas and approaches to improve public health. The level of each student's involvement in research varies according to his or her degree program and the duration of the program. Faculty are encouraged to use students in their research projects and many students are supported through graduate research assistants or positions on research grants. Students with GRAs are actively involved in faculty research. PhD and MS programs require a research -oriented dissertation, the focus of which is usually generated through involvement in faculty research. An MPH student's internship may also have a research component. Students are enc ouraged to present their research at APHA or other professional meetings and are eligible for financial assistance for travel to the meetings. In addition, the UAHS has an annual Poster Forum for students in the health sciences colleges (medicine, nursing , pharmacy, and public health). MEZCOPH financially supports this event and encourages students to present their research. Faculty research interests contribute to the overall curriculum of each academic section within the College. All academic sections offer seminars in which faculty members present their research activities for discussion and students are encouraged to participate. Specific examples of student opportunities for involvement in faculty research and scholarly activities are described b elow for the Arizona Prevention Research Center, the Hopi Environmental Health Project, El Trabajo no te Debe Da\u00f1ar, Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) Medical Marijuana Program, and the Environment, Exposure Science and Risk Assessment Center (E SRAC). The Arizona Prevention Research Center (AzPRC) provides numerous opportunities for MPH and doctoral students to engage in activities designed to build their knowledge and skills in four major areas: community engaged research, health disparities, U S Mexico Border health issues and chronic disease prevention research. The AzPRC engages approximately 25 students a year in comprehensive training and research activities, in which they also may gain skills in qualitative and quantitative mixed methods, c ommunity assessment, participatory evaluation and policy development. This student engagement occurs through formal coursework, graduate and undergraduate internships, and Graduate Assistantships. The Border Service Learning Course is a formal course that takes place each year in a border community. MPH and DRPH students spend a week with the AzPRC's Community Action Board (CAB) partners reflecting on social, economic and political factors that impact the health of residents and contributing to community organization priorities and efforts. AzPRC faculty assist the students in securing internships with the CAB 282 partners, and mentor them in their experiences. The AzPRC also offers students numerous opportunities to be involved in community -engaged research as Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs). For example, a graduate student helped to conduct and analyze focus groups with AzPRC's community partners as part of a current Core Research Project. She is developing a manuscript that merges those findings with an analysis of survey data responses from participants. Another example is a doctoral level student in Biostatistics who is developing innovative approaches to AzPRC data analysis. GRAs are also involved in an ongoing participatory partnership with Mariposa Co mmunity Health Center, which culminates each year in an evaluation report that they develop with and for AzPRC partners. AzPRC faculty provide students numerous internship opportunities that are tailored to meet their training interest. In one example, a student conducted her MPH internship with the Arizona Community Health Worker (CHW) Association in which she coordinated stakeholders in developing a process to approve CHW training programs for CHW voluntary certification. This certification was subsequent ly passed into law by the Arizona Legislature. She also helped AzCHOW develop a \"Core Competency Review\" or 4 -hour interview in which CHW Voluntary Certification applicants discuss the core competencies of the profession. Through AzPRC's collaborative grant development they have also encouraged community partners to include stipends for students to provide grant related services. AzPRC facilitated student involvement in a HRSA grant to conduct a needs assessment of elderly residents in Santa Cruz County, as well as assistance in evaluation an effort to improve food systems. Finally, AzPRC has connected several students over the years to efforts of the Arizona Department of Health Services Division of Prevention Services, giving them the opportunity to make c onnections with state -level public health efforts. The University of Arizona is the recipient of an NIEHS sponsored environmental health disparity center named \"The Center for Indigenous Health Research\" (CIEHR). The Hopi Environmental Health Project (HEHP) of CIEHR is a partnership between the University of Arizona and the Hopi Tribe. The project utilizes a community -based participatory research structure, and aims to (1) characterize the magnitude of environmental exposures to particulate matter (PM), As species, U and other contaminants from air, water, and food in households among the Hopi; (2) evaluate how exposures are moderated by social determinants of health, social capital and community resilience; and (3) expand the Hopi Tribe's capacity to add ress areas of environmental concern that can inform programs and policy. Tribal members conduct all fieldwork with support by the work of our university students. The project has provided a variety of research opportunities for sixteen individual students including interaction with the Community Advisory Board, questionnaire development, calibration and training with air pollution equipment, writing and implementing field procedures, training Hopi field personnel, data entry, database development, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. In addition to instruction from faculty, all students receive ethics and safety training (CITI, Native American Module, Chemical safety, Biosafety, MEZCOPH Lab Safety). The project interacts with STEM programs on campus to maximize student research opportunities (EHS -TRU, UROC, BLASIER, UBRP and STEPS). Some of these programs are designed to enhance diversity in STEM related fields. Of the sixteen students on the HEHP project, six are Hispanic and three are Native. There a re three students in the EHS PhD program and one in the EHS MS program. Six undergraduate students completed their internship with the program, three students used project data for their undergraduate honors theses and one high school student joined us for a summer research experience. The NIEHS is also funding an R01 research project \"El Trabajo no te Debe Da\u00f1ar : Reduction of Hazardous Exposures in Small Businesses through a Community Health Worker Intervention\" As PI, Dr. Paloma Beamer uses a community engaged research framework to assess exposures and their effects on health among vulnerable populations, active ly engaging students and community members. This project aims to reduce negative health outcomes in small businesses that primarily employ high -risk Latino workers by characterizing their exposures to hazardous chemicals and assessing if a community health worker (CHW) intervention is effective at decreasing these exposures. Although preventable by definition, occupational disease and injuries are leading causes of death in the United States, with a disproportionate burden faced by Latinos. Small businesses pose a particular risk. They are more likely to employ low -wage Latino workers, and often use hazardous solvents including volatile organic chemicals that can cause asthma, cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disease; yet their workers lack access to culturally and linguistically appropriate occupational health and pollution prevention information due to economic, physical, and social barriers. CHW -led interventions and outreach in Latino communities have documented increased access to health care and health education and reduced workplace exposures among farmworkers. CHWs are an innovative method to bridge the gap between these small business 283 communities and other stakeholders. The proposed project will capitalize on established partnerships between t he University of Arizona, the Sonora Environmental Research Institute, Inc. and the El Rio Community Health Center. In the first year and a half of this project, 9 MEZCOPH undergraduates and 5 graduate students (3 EHS PhD, 1 Epidemiology PhD, 1 Anthropolog y PhD) have helped develop, refine, and implement to varying degrees nearly every component of the project, with much of it bilingual, including occupational health site audits, chemical sampling instructions, participant report back materials, and qualita tive analyses of interviews. Eleven of the students are Latinx and the project has also allowed them to engage with community partners including SERI (a non -profit) and El Rio Community Health Center (FQHC). While Dr. Beamer's projects have collected valua ble research data, they have inspired students, the majority from underrepresented backgrounds, to continue their education in environmental and public health and provided them an opportunity to serve these communities. The state of Arizona passed the Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA) in 2010. The AMMA allows licensed health care providers within the state to recommend to patients the use of medical marijuana for at least one qualifying condition. Under a service contract with the Arizona Department of Healt h Services (ADHS) Medical Marijuana Program, Dr. Rosales and her team have had the opportunity, for the last eight years, to integrate research and scholarly activities by providing students in our program real world experience and instruction in response to a state health agency aiming to inform policy. They provide students at all levels (undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students) the opportunity and experience of learning how to conduct systematic reviews, prepare the review protocols, the actual sy stematic review, and publication of their work. In 2011, they reviewed conditions proposed by residents who were attempting to qualify conditions for medical marijuana use through an application to ADHS -AMMA. The initial reports prepared by the UA MEZCOPH, 2012 -2013, were published by ADHS and found at https://azdhs.gov/licensing/medical -marijuana/index.php#debilitating under Debilitating Medical Conditions: 2013 Report on Depression 2013 Report on Migraines 2013 Report on Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder 2012 Report from Canadian Agency for Drugs and T echnologies in Health (June) 2012 Report on Depression 2012 Report on Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2012 Report on Migraine Headaches 2012 Report on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) In 2014, through joint decision with the ADHS -AMMA staff, the team transitioned to usin g the Cochrane methodology to conduct more extensive search and meta -analysis, when viable.

The role of research and scholarly activity for faculty advancement depends on the faculty classification. Scholarly activity is required for all tenure -eligible faculty, and is expected from all tenured faculty. Career track faculty may have primary res earch roles or may have not have research expectations. Many tenure - eligible faculty members have a 40% time expectation for scholarly activity, with the exact amount determined year to year in agreement with the faculty member's department chair. MEZCO PH has an annual performance review (APR) process that allows faculty members to demonstrate their competence and performance regarding their teaching, research and service so it can be reviewed by their peers and division directors. This process provides information back to faculty members so they can use it to prepare for their promotion and tenure process, and the post -tenure reviews of tenured faculty. MEZCOPH conducts the APRs each calendar year using an online process, APROL (Annual Performance Review Online). All Faculty members enter their information into the APROL system which is then stored in a searchable database. The faculty member completes these performance review documents and provides a self -ranking on instruction, research, service and ad ministration (if applicable). The APR documents include the work plan from the previous year, courses taught, graduate student advising and committee membership, research/scholarship grants funded, research/scholarship grants submitted, publications, sc holarly presentations, awards and honors, College and university service, local, state, national and international service. The documents and updated curriculum vitae are provided electronically to the d epartment chair and reviewed by a Peer Review Committ ee of three or more members who assess the faculty and provide a ranking on instruction, research, and service. All faculty members meet with their d epartment chair to discuss their review, the comments of the Peer Review Committee, and the d epartment chair's rankings. The work plan for the next year is finalized at this meeting. The completed annual performance reviews are then forwarded to the Dean's office. In consultation with the d epartment chairs , the Dean addresses any problems wit h faculty performance and also identifies those individuals who have made especially noteworthy contributions to MEZCOPH's programs. The Dean also meets with all faculty members individually on a biannual basis to go over their progress and future goals. MEZCOPH also recognizes outstanding performance by its faculty and academic professionals with annual awards for teaching, research, and service. In addition, MEZCOPH faculty, academic professionals and staff compete successfully for university -wide awar ds. An additional means of faculty evaluation is through the promotion and tenure process. Briefly, promotion and tenure guidelines for appointment and promotion formalize achievement expectations for specific ranks. For appointment to Assistant Profes sor, promise must be demonstrated in the areas of teaching, research and service. Promotion to Associate Professor with tenure is achieved by demonstrating 285 documented excellence in teaching and mentoring, providing indicators of a national reputation in s cholarly activity, demonstrating leadership and excellence in service to the institution, and service at the regional or national level. Promotion to full Professor is achieved by demonstrating international recognition for scholarly contributions, contin ued excellence in teaching, a national or international reputation in service, and also a demonstrated leadership role in mentoring junior faculty. Tenure -eligible faculty members undergo a mandatory third -year review to inform their development plan for mentoring and to assure that the candidate is on track to achieve tenure. The final tenure review is conducted no later than the 6 th year in rank. Upon promotion to associate professor with tenure, the typical career progression is evaluation for promotion to professor with tenure no later than the 6 th year in rank. All promotion processes for tenure -eligible or tenured individuals are subject to review by the University of Arizona Promotion and Tenure Committee and the Provost's Office. The MEZCOPH Promo tion and Tenure committee also is responsible for the annual post -tenure review process. Briefly, the annual performance review ratings of all tenured faculty members are reviewed, with 20% of the tenured faculty selected for an in -depth discussion of the ir annual performance review documents on a yearly basis. If any deficiencies are noted, a Faculty Development Plan or a Performance Improvement Plan (depending on the extent of the deficiencies) is developed by the faculty member, their Division Director and the Dean. Such plans state goals with monitoring and benchmarks to ensure that the noted deficiencies are rectified within the specified period. Non-tenure eligible faculty requirements for appointment to rank are identical to those for tenure eli gible, except that the expectation for excellence may be in two of the three evaluated areas (i.e., research/scholarship, teaching, service). Non -tenure -eligible faculty members undergo review every fifth year for promotion or retention in rank (Assistant Professors) or every sixth year (Associate Professors). Non-tenure eligible appointments or promotions are not reviewed by the University Promotion and Tenure Committee, but are reviewed at the Provost's Office for integrity of process. 6) Select at least three of the measures that are meaningful to the school and demonstrate its success in research and scholarly activities. Provide a target for each measure and data from the last three years in the format of Template E4 -1. In addition to at least thr ee from the list in the criteria, the school may add measures that are significant to its own mission and context . As evident from MEZCOPH's funding, the College's portfolio is diverse, ranging from bench science to community -based research. Funding is obtained from a wide variety of sources, including federal agencies such as NIH, CDC, HRSA, SAMHSA, to national and local foundations. Equally impressive are the wide - ranging collaborations within and among a variety of academic institutions, s tate and local health departments, and community agencies locally, nationally and internationally. Considerable effort is made to address issues of health disparities with a focus on the underserved populations of the Southwest. MEZCOPH also strives to involve students in both the conduct of the projects as well as publications resulting from them . MEZCOPH will continue to work to support its research mission and the research activities of its faculty and administrative professionals. The College has a lso allocated funds for an additional senior accountant in the Business Office to support the college's research enterprise. 286 Template E4 -1. MEZCO PH Indicators of Success for Research Activities from 2016 -2018 Indicator 2016 2017 2018 1.1 Expenditures on externally funded grants & contracts (with MEZCOPH PI) will average at least $250,000 annually per TE/T faculty member $350,042 $359,326 $324,747 1.2 Primary faculty will, on average, be externally funded for at least 30% time for research , training and/or other scholarly activity 36% 30% 32% 1.3 Tenured and tenure-track faculty will publish, on average, at least three peer-reviewed articles per year 4.53 4.53 3.93 1.4 At graduation, at least 40% of our MPH students will have participated in a research project (as part of a class or outside of the classroom), given a scientific presentation or were an author or coauthor of a publication 40% 55% 55% 7) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses rela ted to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not applicable. 287 E5. FACULTY EXTRAMURAL SERVICE 288 E5. Faculty Extramural Service The school defines expectations regarding faculty extramural service activity. Participation in internal university committees is not within the definition of this section. Service as described here refers to contributions of professional expertise to the community, including professional practice. It is an explicit activity undertak en for the benefit of the greater society, over and beyond what is accomplished through instruction and research. As many faculty as possible are actively engaged with the community through communication, collaboration, consultation, provision of technical assistance and other means of sharing the school's professional knowledge and skills. While these activities may generate revenue, the value of faculty service is not measured in financial terms. 1) Describe the school's definition and expectations regarding faculty extramural service activity. Explain how these relate/compare to university definitions and expectations. Faculty are expected to provide extramural service. Extramural service is defined as having service to community organizations, p rofessional organizations, government. It is also further categorized as being local, state, national and international. In keeping with the overall mission and the service and practice goal, community engagement has served as a framework for continued str ong, synergistic relationships connecting research, instruction and practice. This framework provides the opportunity for the centers and initiatives to include within their agendas numerous community engagement, practice and service activities. Addition ally, the College has identified major priority focus areas for its community engagement which includes health disparities, strengthening collaboration, healthy Arizona priorities, and public health preparedness. The service activities are carried out by the College's centers, within course work including service learning course and by individual faculty and academic professionals. 2) Describe available university and school support for extramural service activities. Tenure and tenure eligible faculty members are provided state funding for 0.50 FTE of which 0.2 FTE supports service and research efforts that are determined by the facul ty member and the depar tment chair. Additionally, the college supports having a strong overlap between research and service for many faculty members whose studies work closely with community organizations. We support service learning as stand -alone cours es and service activities within courses. The service learning courses have expanded over the years. Initially there were two community -based field courses and these expanded to four service learning courses with similar themes to work closely with commun ity- based organizations. The college then started a course that has students respond to suspected outbreaks of food -borne illnesses. We then set up separate courses that have students who in schools regarding sun safety, asthma management, girl's self-esteem. We also have a relatively new course that has students work with state legislators and wit h the Pima Animal Care Center. Additionally, several faculty members have incorporated service activities within the regularly taught courses. The projects conducted by our centers have strong service components. An example is the Arizona Prevention Research Center that works closely with our state's association of community health workers, and the Mariposa Community Health Center, a federally qualified community health center located in Nogales, Arizona. 3) Describe and provide three to five examples of faculty extramural service acti vities and how faculty integrate service experiences into their instruction of students. Kidenga : Kidenga is a community -based disease detection system which allows the team of public health investigators to track day -biting mosquito populations within a community and identify people who have symptoms of illness. The app also provides users with county -level confirmed case information, educational material and up -to-date news on mosquito activity. To help public health agencies detect these 289 viruses as early as possible, researchers at the UA Zuckerman College of Public Health are looking for citizen scientists to use Kidenga to help collect data on Aedes aegypti , the mosquito that transmits Zika, dengue and chikungunya and other disease s. Any resident of the U.S. and Canada over age 13 can use the app. Once a week, Kidenga will ask users to report mosquito activity and symptoms near their home. Users also can view aggregate information from other user reports within their zip code; get the latest news on Zika, dengue and chikungunya; and learn how to protect themselves, their family and community from diseases spread by mosquitoes. This development of this app was led by Kacey Ernst with students in collaboration with the Arizona Resear ch Laboratories' Bio Computing Facility. School Based Asthma Management: Dr. Lynn Gerald has implemented school -based asthma programs in selected elementary schools in Tucson and on the Navajo Reservation. The Supervised Asthma Medicine in Schools (SAMS) has an interdisciplinary team that includes Joe Gerald, MD, PhD, a health economist and health outcomes re searcher and Aimee Snyder, MPH, and DrPH student at the UA Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health; Jamie Goodwin, PhD, and Clara Ehrman, BS, BSHS, experienced project managers at the Arizona Respiratory Center; Conrad Clemens, MD, a pediatrician a nd associate dean for graduate medical education at the UA College of Medicine - Tucson; Mark Brown, MD, a pediatric pulmonary specialist at the Arizona Respiratory Center; Donna Bryson, RN, AE -C, a lung health educator with the American Lung Association i n Arizona; Donna Johnson, RN, BSN, Med, TUSD director of school health services; and Nikki Stefan, RN, BSN, TUSD coordinator of school health services. The work of this team also led to the passage of an Arizona state bill that allows schools to have stock albuterol inhalers for students with asthma. Non -medical school personnel are now certified and able to administer albuterol after completing a free online training course developed by our college's Western Region Public Health Training Center. Safe Bar s: Dr. Mary Koss and Dr. Elise Lopez are working with bars to train liquor serving staff to intervene in situations that could be precursors to sexual assault. These researchers look at individual level outcomes in servers that are using these intervention strategies, peer -level changes in feeling supported to intervene, bar level changes to create a less rape -supportive environment, and community change through police calls for sexual assault within a one -mile radius of each Arizona's Universities (UA, Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University ). Funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. One H ealth Program: Our MPH One Health concentration has integrated two extramural activities into the curriculum that provide students Dr. Pogreba -Brown directs the Student Aid for Field Epidemiology Response (SAFER) team that has students work with various c ounty health departments in Arizona as well as the state health department to aid in outbreak investigations and serves on the state's Foodborne Taskforce Committee. 4) Describe and provide three to five examples of student opportunities for involvement in faculty extramural service. Healthy 2B Me Summer Camp for Kid s. The Healthy 2B Me summer camp program for children ages 7 -10 occurs during the months of June and July. It has a 7-year history of existence and is coordinated by the Canyon Ranch Center for Health Promotion. The camp provides MEZCOPH students opportunities to provide nut rition and physical education to children. MEZCOPH students also learn how to organize events. The se week -long day camp s expose kids to all the summer fun activities they love like swimming, yoga, and Zumba, plus team building exercises, cooking demonstrat ions, and art activities, while learning about sun safety, dental hygiene, tobacco prevention, nutrition, germ safety, and more! The lessons are taught by experts from the UA College of Public Health, the UA Canyon Ranch Center for Prevention and Health P romotion, and members of the Tucson community. Go Girrrls Go Grrrls is a gender -specific intervention curriculum for early adolescent girls that tries to promote a positive transition to adulthood It is a social skill building and psychoeducational program administered in a group setting \u2014 targeted towards girls in their early teens. When compared to a control group using a self -reported evaluation, the program has shown a positive effect on girls' self-efficacy , body image and asse rtiveness . A pilot 290 program was launched in 1995 and a final version was published in 1999. It is administered by a team of two or more co -facilitator s. Students work with Dr. Velia Nuno to provide the after-school intervention. The program is partitioned into several sessions of 30 -60 minutes length . They are administered over a dozen weeks and focused on six topics: o \"Being a girl\": introduction and evaluation, identifying gender roles and challenging societal pressures. o Positive body image and mindset: activities to boost self-image; understanding the effects of self-criticism, depression and eating disorders. o Making and keeping friends: social and life skills, independent critical thinking and developing satisfactory peer relationships. o When it all seems like too much: teach girls when to seek help and how to find resources for help. o Let's talk about sex: basics of reproduction, sexuality and sexually transmitted diseases, how to refuse unwanted advances, and the effects of drugs and alcohol. o \"Planning for the future\": teach girls to make goals and work to achieve them. Pima Animal Care Center. Dr. Pogreba -Brown and Dr. Ellingson have formed a partnership with the Pima Animal Care Center (PACC) to allow graduate students to participate in resear ch projects at the animal shelter as part of their One Health program coursework. The students taking this course look at current PACC initiatives and programs in order to gain a better understanding of their operation and effectiveness when it comes to serving animals and people, in the interest of protecting and supporting overall pu blic health. The students focus on several areas, including Evaluation of call -line data: Students monitor the calls coming into PACC looking for patterns in the type of requests from the community; Infection Control: The students document the diseases and infections of animals being processed into the shelter to identify areas in Pima County in greatest need of help; Program Evaluation: The students evaluate existing PACC programs, including Foster Care and Care Kits for pet owners facing homelessness; and Intake Data: Students provide a survey that can help determine additional information on pets and owners such as demographics, breed, and vaccination history. Juntos Por La Salud (Together for Health). Students work with the college's primary prevention mobile health unit to support \"Saludable\" (Healthy), a six -week prevention and intervention program designed for children ages 8 -13 to tackle the link between toxic stress and obesity in Latino children l iving in both Pima and Maricopa counties. The curriculum focuses on three areas of health and well -being: nutrition, physical activity (in the form of yoga), and mindfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR) techniques . 5) Select at least three of the indicators that are meaningful to the school and relate to service. Describe the school's approach and progress over the last three years for each of the chosen indicators. In addition to at least three from the list in the cri teria, the school may add indicators that are significant to its own mission and context. Four indicators related to service that are meaningful to our school from the list in the CEPH criteria are: Number of community -based service projects Percent of primary instructional faculty participating in extramural service activities Total service funding Faculty appointed on a professional practice track The following graphics provide the time trend for the indicators that our school uses to that indicate our dedication and effort to service. These data represent ongoing community engagemen t. These indicators are collected th rough our UAVita system, UA accounting resources and our human resources office. Number of community -based servic e projects (2016 -2018) The number of faculty members engaged in community -based service projects had a significant increase in 2017 compared with 2016 and then remained relatively the same in 2018 (Figure 3 ). We are currently collecting data for 2019 through UAVITA which is used for our annual performance evaluation of faculty 291 members. We believe that our historical track record of being community engaged is being maintained. We are pleased with keeping a large number of faculty engaged in community -based service projects. This was validated by being one of two finalists for the 2018 ASPPH Harrison C. Spencer Award for Outstanding Community Service ( Figure 4 ). Figure 3. Number of Faculty Members Engaged in Commu nity-Based Projects Figure 4. 2018 ASPPH Harrison C. Spencer Award Percent of primary instructional faculty participating in extramural service activities (2015 -2018 ) Figure 5 indicates that percent of faculty and academic professionals who were engaged each year with community engagement. The data are sourced from UAVitae, Service as part of a faculty member's annual performance evaluation. The service is linked to their overa ll performance which is also linked to merit 6085 84 0102030405060708090 2016 2017 2018Number of Community -Based Projects by Year 292 increases. The activities include p rofessional service and outreach Extramural with any COPH Engagement Attribute or any Healthy People engagement attributes. These data indicate that greater than 75% of our faculty and academic professionals are engaged in these activities. Many of these activities have been described previously and include working with health departments, local non -profits, schools, and private industry. We believe that keeping above 75% each year is commendable and we look to continue to have faculty involved. Figure 5. Faculty's Community Engagement Objective Total service funding A significant amount of our extramural funding is focused on service. The sources of funds come from multiple sources (Table E5 ). A complete list of the service projects is provided in ERF E5 which identifies the PI for the grant, project title and the amount funded each year. Although there was a decrease in funding from 2017 to 2018 due to fluctuations in the cycles of grant funding, funding for the past two years has remained stable. The decrease in 2018 was partially due to less emphasis on our navigator programs that supported enrolling citizens onto insurance programs with the Affordable Care Act. We anticipate that 2020 funding will significantly increase as we have obtained several gra nts (> $650,000) to address the opioid epidemic in Arizona. Table E5.

In 2018, MEZCOPH started to transition several of its career track faculty to be identified as professors of practice. Currently, several of the of the assistant professors of practice also hold leadership positions in the college and are taking on large r roles within the University of Arizona Health Sciences. For example , three program directors are professors of practice (Aminata Kilungo for Environmental and Occupational Health; Eduardo Gonzalez for Public Health Practice and Health Services Administr ation; and Velia Nuno for Family and Child Health). Additionally, Heather Carter , an Assistant Professor of Practice is also leading the Health S ciences strategic initiative 1.4 to Minimize the Debt Burden for Students . As a State Senator, she led the pas sage of the Arizona legislation that will provide full tuition scholarships for medical students who commit to practicing primary care in rural Arizona and has developed a financial literacy education program for public health students. Table E5.1 provides the number of professional practice -track faculty.

MEZCOPH has been a leadi ng college of public health for its involvement with community service. It has conducted needs asses sment for more than pu blic health workforce personnel working in county, state and tribal health departments to support their accreditation . During the past 7 years, the MEZCOPH Training Center with its partners has developed numerous online trainings , webinars, and two pod -cast seri es and hosts 2 pod -cast series for its partners at the California AHEC and the University of Nevada, Reno. MEZCOPH has created an active academic health department with Pima County. Since the formalization of the Academic Health Department in August 2019 with Pima County Health Department, the Office of the Interim Associate Dean of Community and Engagement and Outreach is establishing Academic Health Departments with Cochise and Santa Cruz County. The Academic Health Dep artment in Cochise County has prioritized the following collaboration areas: 1. Mental Health/Substance Use 2. Lead Poisoning Program and 3. Development of a Public Health Internship Program. Unlike the Academic Health Departments in Cochise County and Pim a County, the Academic Health Department in Santa Cruz County is an agreement between MEZCOPH, Santa Cruz County Health Department, and Mariposa Community Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center. Priority areas for 2020 and the Memorandum of Und erstanding is underway. As a component of the Academic Health Department, the Office of the Interim Associate Dean of Community Engagement and Outreach has coordinated in -person trainings with the National Network of Libraries of Medicine Pacific Southwest Education and Outreach Librarian for health department employees. The trainings are unique and are developed based on the needs of the public health workforce at Cochise Health and Social Services, Santa Cruz County Health Department, Mariposa Co mmunity Center, and Pima County Health Department. The trainings will be held on February 10 th and 11 th. Figure 6 provides the trend for t he percent of faculty involved with workforce development was greater than 40% in 2016 and 2017 but dropped during the past year. This may be an anomaly in the data but also a result of the extensive amount of workforce development that is being provided by the college's public health training center. Data sourced from UAVitae, MEZCOPH Continuing Education and Workforce Development input 294 section, and Extramural Service with an activity classification of \"Continuing Educa tion and Workforce Development.\" Additionally, in response to the reported decline, MEZCOPH has initiate d the development of a public health academic health department with Pima County Health Department. The collaboration has resulted in developing a mini -public health school consisting of a series of joint seminars (See ERF E6) and having faculty members participate in a 10-episode podcast series , Keeping Up with Public Health (https://anchor.fm/keeping -up) developed by the WRPHTC that highlight their research as part of continual training pro gram for the public health workforce. Figure 6. Faculty Engaged in Workforce Development Objective 6) Describe the role of service in decisions about faculty advancement. As a land grant institution, Service is central to the mission of the University as well as the College. All faculty members are expected to contribute to the service mission of the College and the University through a variety of activities which include collaboration with the public health infrastructure in the state at th e local, tribal, and state levels as well as col laboration with those community -based organizations implementing essential services which correspond to the services and functions of public health. Additionally, faculty members are expected to provide service through their relationships with professional organizations and nationally and internationally through public health networks. Each faculty member determines the specific expectations of service based on his/her academic expertise and the annual work plan in consultation with his/her division director. In terms of the speci fic promotion and tenure process, the guidelines were modified in 2003 to expand the definition of scholarship, teaching and service to be inclusive of community engagement in all three areas. Over the following years, CEPAS has continued to provide docu mentation and orientation to all faculty members to assist in developing portfolios that highlight community engagement and community engaged scholarship. Service is part of the promotion and tenure packet. Faculty are required to report their percent ef fort that they have provided to service. The official promotion and tenure packet has a section for service. Each faculty member also has to include what has been their contribution to service within the personal statement for promotion and tenure. 7) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area.

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN SCHOOL EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT 296 F1. Community Involvement in School Evaluation and Assessment The school engages constituents, including community stakeholders, alumni, employers and other relevant community partners. Stakeholders may include professionals in sectors other than health (eg, attorneys, architects, parks and recreation personnel). Specifically, the school ensures that constituents provide regular feedback on its student outcomes, curriculum and overall planning processes, including the self -study process. 1) Describe any formal structures for constituent input (eg, community advisory board, alumni association, etc.). List members and/or officers as applicable, with their credentials and professional affiliations. The college's centers and initiatives provide for a strong foundation for partnerships with community organizations to implement public health in a meaningful context that is relevant to the region. In addition, these partnerships serve as an important mechanism for assuring that community organizat ions are actively involved in the work of the College. Table F1 provides examples of the number and qualification of community members who work with our Centers and Initiatives . Table F1.

The College's centers and initiatives have advisory boards a nd community partners who meet regularly to discuss their work and provide information that is relevant to the effectiveness of the College. They provide input on knowledge gaps and new directions to be pursued. The advisory boards for the Arizona Prevent ion Research Center, the Center for Rural Health, and the Western Region Public Health Training Center along with the College's Community Advisory Board all meet regularly with College faculty and 298 administrators to provide input on the educational needs fo r the current and future public health workforce. Our Alpha Nu Chapter of Delta Omega is another avenue for which input can be provided to the college of curriculum. Additionally , the college conducts surveys of the alumni and works with employers to obtain information on how our academic training has prepared students for the workforce. Faculty members have also met with the Arizona Local Health Officers Association (the directors of the county health departments) and have regular meetin gs with health departments. MEZCOPH is currently working to create an academic health department with the Pima County Health Department and hired a specific coordinator to assist with this initiative. MEZCOPH also has extensive relationships with the publ ic health community through its adjunct faculty. Each d epartment has adjunct faculty members who contribute their skills and expertise as well as their understanding of community needs and provide regular input into college courses and activities in the community. Given the reality that public health is implemented in communities, MEZCOPH also utilizes guest lecturers from the community in many of its courses. This includes county health department directors, local politicians, state legislators, congres sional representatives, non -governmental groups, community development/community mobilizers, community health center directors, community health workers, etc. Additionally, one of our faculty members, Dr. Heather Carter, is currently the State Senator f rom Legislative District 15 (North Phoenix, Scottsdale and Cave Creek) and is chair of the senate's Higher Education and Workforce Development committee, vice -chair of the Health and Human Services Committee and sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee. She provides continuous input to the college regarding issues related to public health policy and programs that are integrated into our curriculum. The undergraduate and MPH internship programs also provide numerous opportunities for feedback from the co mmunity through their evaluations of student performance. Finally, our service learning courses provide a mechanism for regular dialogue and communication with our community partners in rural, urban, tribal, and border underserved communities throughout t he region. 3) Describe how the school's external partners contribute to the ongoing operations of the school. At a minimum, this discussion should include community engagement in the following: a) Development of the vision, mission, values, goals and evaluation measures Our recent revision of the college's mission to focus on wellness was undertaken with input from our community advisory board (CAB) that includes a member from the Arizona Department of Health Services, business leaders and socially co nscious individuals. The CAB is regularly given updates on initiatives and provides feedback on what are important outcomes measures. They are given our Dean's monthly updates and are included in our listservs . b) Development of the self-study document The college's self-study team included 2 community members, Julia Flannery from the Pima County Health Department and the Robert Ojeda from the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona. Both of these individuals have worked with faculty and students from the College. An early draft of our self - study was also distributed to our Community Advisory Board , other community members , and faculty for feedback with instructions to focus on specific areas related to them (Example email in ERF A1.1 ). c) Assessment of changing practice and research needs We continually obtain feedback from community members through alumni surveys with students who are now our community partners, from our community advisory boards, and from needs assessments regarding the training needs of the workforce. These partners provide input through their participation on specific service and research projects. Community partners have been instrumental with having us modify the teaching agenda focus on our service learning in order to give students more opportunities to work with c ommunity members. They have encouraged us to develop our One Health MPH concentration and Maricopa County provides financial support for our SAFER program that conducts rapid response investigations of food borne illnesses . 299 We also collaborate closely w ith community -based organizations as they provide us funding for both practice and research. The State Health Office provides the financial support to MEZCOPH in order for us to operate the State's tobacco quit line and to conduct literature reviews to as sess the level of evidence on for which health conditions could qualify for obtaining a medical marijuana prescription. We work with community members to determine how to better meet the public health leadership needs within our border region and within our HRSA region . This ongoing effort has led to many different collaborations related to practice and research. The US -Mexico Border Health Commission has worked with the MECOPH to develop the Leaders Across Borders Certificate Program. d) Asse ssment of school graduates' ability to perform competencies in an employment setting Data for this section of the report was obtained by the MEZCOPH Alumni Database maintained by the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs to determine the level of preparedness that MEZCOPH graduates exhibit when starting their careers in the public health workforce. Student interns identified the top ten employers of alumni who graduated between May 2016 and May 2018. Participants were required to have sup ervised or employed graduates of the MEZCOPH Bachelor of Science, Master of Public Health, Master of Science, or Doctor of Public Health program(s). The College contacted employers by phone and e -mail and invited employers to complete a short interview by phone or e -mail. Interview questions were both qualitative and quantitative. Interns inputted results from the interview into Qualtrics during or immediately following the interview. Employers self -identified the type of organization they represented, ch oosing one of the following options; \"state Employers used a Likert scale to rate how competent they felt MEZCOPH graduates were in performing the program's foundational competencies in an employment setting and how prepared they felt graduates were for positions assumed in the organization. When employers supervised graduates with differing degrees, for example, MPH and BS, employers completed one survey for each education level of the employees (as opposed to one survey for each employee). Employers were asked to answer two open -ended questions \"Is the employee competent to do their job? Please explain.\" and \"What skills can be impr oved by graduates in the workforce?\" After data were collected, quantitative questions were measured by both frequencies and percentages. Content analysis of qualitative questions was used to identify emerging competency level themes. Quantitative and qu alitative results will be used to inform the development of curriculum to meet the growing public health workforce needs. The employer survey included 31 supervisors who had hired undergr aduate and graduate students. Eighteen of these sup ervisors were at universities, seven were at l ocal and state health offices, five were at private non -profit agency and one was another type of health provider. Most of these supervisors had hired an undergraduate student (15 ), and MPH students (13), only two had h ired DrPH students. We report the findings from those who had hired our undergraduate and MPH alumni. All the employers stated that the undergraduate students were working competently in their position. Most employers believed that the students were compe tent with their ability to communicate public health information in both oral and written forms through a variety of media and to diverse audiences and were competent with their ability to locate, use, evaluate and synthesize public health information (Table F2). Comments from the supervisors included statements such as \"excellent interpersonal skills\", \"deep awareness of local, national and global health issues and disparities\" and \"great data analysis skills to connect to broader trends.\" Recommendations on what could be improved with regards to preparing students included having them be more prepared as public speakers and greater experience working with communities. 300 Table F2. Employers reported competency of undergraduate alumni Competency (n= # Employers ) Very Competent (%) Competent (%) Somewhat Competent or Not Competent (%) Not Applicable (%) Ability to communicate public health information (n=14) 80% 13.33% 0% 6.67% Ability to locate, information (n= 15) 60% 33.33% 6.67% 0% Extremely Prepared (%) Very / Well Prepared (%) Somewhat Prepared (%) How prepared was the student for their position (n= 15) 46.67% 46.66% 6.67% All 31 employers interviewed believed that the MPH students that they hired were competent in their current position and competent in their public health skills. Quantitative feedback regarding specific competencies is provided in Table F3. Comments from the supervisors included statements such as \"very good at accessing resources to take on new responsibilities\", \"committed to public health ,\" \"very articulate in the public health scope of practice ,\" \"understand the stakeholders who have to be involved with our organization to carry out our mission ,\" and \"excellent interpersonal skills essential to collaborative programming success.\" Recommendations on what could be improved with regards to preparing students included training all students on R programming and greater understanding of coalition development.

Area 1 (Section 3c) : With regards to how community partners assess our practices, i n the Community Advisory Board minutes ( ERF A1.1 ) dated September 26, 2017, there was a presentation by Dr. Velia - Nu\u00f1o regarding the Nu rtured Heart Approach and her Growing Girls program. An assessment by the board identified this area of wellness as a gap within our college and led to the effort to incorporate this work into the undergraduate academic curriculum. We now have implemented four special topics courses that are developed so they can be incorporated into an undergraduate emphasis area. Another example of how external partners were involved with MEZCOPH's assessment of outreach is provided in a manuscript by Hirata -Okamoto et al (2017) on the Leaders Across Border Certificate which was conducted in conju nction with the US -Mexico Border Health Commission and the Arizona Department of Health Services to develop better leadership for public health practice. This document identified how MEZCOPH helped meet the need for a leadership program. Area 2 (Section 3d): An assessment by the employers of graduate readiness for the workforce was developed from t he list of top e mployers of our new graduates is provided in ERF F3 .1. This is the list that was used to de velop Table F2 and Table F3 on the readiness of our graduates when they entered the workforce. 5) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not Applicable 302 F2. STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN COMMUNITY AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE 303 F2. Student Involvement in Community and Professional Service Community and professional service opportunities, in addition to those used to satisfy Criterion D4, are available to all students. Experiences should help students to gain an understanding of the contexts in which public health work is performed outside of an academic setting and the importance of learning and contributing to professional advancement in the field. 1) Describe how students are introduced to serv ice, community engagement and professional development activities and how they are encouraged to participate . Students are introduced to service opportunities starting with their orientation to the College. Our orientation for new graduate students each fall has included service learning projects at the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona (2014), Living Streets Alliance that promotes physical activity (2015), Iskashitaa that promotes nutrition for refugees (2016) , and at the Primavera Foundation that provides opportunities to get families out of poverty with housing and workforce development programs (2017). In 2018 students were provided a presentation on Community Engagement in Research -Community Academic Collaboration\" instead of a service activity. In 2019, students worked with Casa Alitas that serves migrant families who have left their home countries to escape violence and poverty. All of our undergraduate students take the require course HPS 387 Health Disparities and Minority Health. Every student in this class is required to partici pate in service activities that are part of the course. Students in one section each year for HPS 200 Introduction to Public Health also volunteer in the community as a course requirement. These are prior to their practicum. There are also several other community -based undergraduate and graduate special topics courses that incorporate a service component . For example, these courses have included working with students and faculty in schools on issues such as sun safety, asthma and personal growth. Additionally, we have a series of one -week intensive 3 -unit service learning courses that provide students the opportunity to work with community members rural and urban environments, at the state legislature and with tribal organizations. The Service Learning Program is one of the distinguishing characteristics of our College as it relates to community engagement, practice and service. Service learning is a vehicle for strengthening partnerships between health professions schools and communities. It is building a str ong commitment to community service and social responsibility in health professions schools, students and faculty, and is equipping health professionals with community -oriented competencies necessary to practice in today's changing world. All service learn ing courses include specific service learning activities that are accompanied by structured individual and group reflection. We have developed five service learning courses, utilizing an intensive week -long model which immersed students, faculty and commun ity partners directly in communities which are facing huge health disparity issues; together we implemented programs that directly supported community efforts to address these disparities. Each service activity is structured around reflection questions whi ch provide the framework for understanding the role of public health in the elimination of health disparities: Border Health Service Learning Institute , on an annual basis works directly in our border communities with county health departments in Arizon a and Sonora, Mexico to support community prevention education campaigns focusing on dengue, west Nile, rabies, and TB. Additionally, students work with nongovernmental organizations to support local community gardens, food kitchens, and community health w orker outreach in the community. Maternal and Child Health Programs in the Rural Southwest , on an annual basis works directly with tribal communities to support the community health representative program, learning about the model and providing workshops for health education material development both on paper and electronically. Maternal and Child Health Programs in Urban settings , on an annual basis works directly with organizations serving marginalized populations including the homeless, ref ugees, urban Indians, and inner -city Latinos/as to enhance their program services and provide new activities and materials for program development. Rural Health Service Learning Institute focuses on copper mining and farming communities in our state and partn ers with local health departments, county extension programs, rural tribal health 304 departments, and local non -governmental agencies to support additional programmatic opportunities for the agencies and the populations that they serve. Phoenix Urban Populati ons is our newest Service Learning Course with a focus on marginalized populations in the Phoenix area. The course works focuses directly on unique partnerships that enhance quality of life in the Phoenix community including veteran's organizations, commun ity mobilization organizations, Latino Arts organizations, and others. In the past two years we have added several other service learning courses , examples are : Public Health for Communi ty Wellness. This semester -length course is offered fall and spring semesters annually. In this course, students develop skills in wellness assessments and lifestyle interventions, gain insights into population health and health disparities through the lens of social determinants of health, and build community relat ionships for further work such as internships. Maternal and Child Health in Urban Settings . This course works directly with organizations serving marginalized populations including the homeless, ref ugees, urban Indians, and inner -city Latinos/as to enhance their program services and provide new activities and materials for program development. Whether you have lived in Tucson all your life or are newly transplanted, this course will immerse you in Pima County agencies that serve the public health needs of c hildren and families. Community -Action -Policy. This is a semester -length class that meets five times, along with a one - week immersion experience at the Arizona State Legislature during Spring Break. The service - learning portion of the course is a structured learning experience that combines community service with explicit learning objectives, preparation, and reflection. Students involved in service -learning are expected not only to provide direct community service but also to learn about the conte xt in which the service is provided, the connection between the service and their academic coursework, and their roles as citizens. In addition to this intensive week -long model of service learning, we also have a semester -long service learning core cours e focusing on Program Planning and Evaluation in which students work directly with a community organization to collaborate on products related to program planning and/or evaluation for the organization. Most recently several of our faculty have incorporate d some service learning opportunities for their students as a component of the sociocultural and behavioral aspects of public health in which students work in teams with specific community organizations to enhance the work of the organization. Reflection q uestions relate directly to understanding the sociocultural and behavioral aspects of the particular activity or program. The Center for Indigenous Environ mental Health Research (CIEHR) is partnering with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communit ies to build capacity to determine the contribution of chemical and other environmental exposures to health inequities and support efforts to address these threats. AI/AN communities suffer from increased mortality attributable to cancer (stomach, gallbla dder, liver and kidney), respiratory disease, diabetes, and liver disease, among other conditions. Chemically contaminated traditional foods, water, air, and household environments, as well as social determinants of health, contribute to these health disp arities and stand out as modifiable factors for AI/AN communities. Employing community -based participatory research approaches, these partnerships are critical to the development of effective and sustainable mitigation strategies that reinforce community strengths and resilience factors (e.g., social networks, spirituality and shared cultural identity and connection). CIEHR also supports efforts to increase environmental health literacy and help translate and disseminate the research findings needed to inf orm community strategies to reduce adverse environmental exposures. 2) Provide examples of professional and community service opportunities in which public health students have participated in the last three years. We work closely with local health departments in addition to its focus on national and international public health issues. We have numerous projects that provide students service opportunities and these are described below. As a College of Public Healt h located in the U.S. -Mexico Border region, we have always considered border health among the top priorities of our College. It provides the opportunity for binational collaboration on 305 the shared public health agendas of both of our countries to strength en the public health infrastructure in the border region. We have a vast array of projects and collaborations, including: 1) Thematic Network in Border Health. The College is a member of this network, which is the binational academic network along the US Mexico border. This network is a multidisciplinary, interagency, and bi -national initiative of individuals and organizations from academic, public, private and social sector of the Mexico -US border, promoted by the Mexico Section of the Mexico -US Border H ealth Commission (known in Spanish as CSFMEU). It is responsible for contributing to the resolution of the most common challenges of public health challenging the Mexico - US border. 2) Health Promotion Model for Migrant Agricultural Workers from Southern Mexico Farmworker Project: This project is focused on identifying the essential characteristics of a model of health promoters to strengthen the health of migrant agricultural workers who are migrating from Southern Mexico to Northern Mexico to work in th e large fruit and vegetable farms in Sonora. The project includes developing an appropriate training curriculum for workers at the work site and in their home communities with active participation of the agricultural company and institutions that can impl ement public policies supporting migrant farmworkers as well as understanding the impact of the health promotor program on the well -being of the workers. 3) Leaders Across Borders: Our College has developed and implemented a unique public health workforc e program that collaborates with public health leaders from the border states in the U.S. and Mexico to develop a set of skills for collaborate on binational public health issues. The Leadership program accepts 20 public health workers who participate in a yearlong program with three face to face workshops and develop a team project around an important binational public health issue. \"Juntos Por Salud\" (Together for Health) Primary Prevention Mobile Unit (video link: https://youtu.be/3TRGqwasV0s ) provides free preventive health screening assessments (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, Hemoglobin A1c, etc.) and access to health services to underserved populations by targeting ke y priority issues such as nutrition, obesity, diabetes, mental health, and domestic violence, to name a few. With units in Tucson and Phoenix serving Pima, Santa Cruz, Pinal and Maricopa counties, the program aims to promote healthy lifestyle choices and utilizes culturally and sensitively created materials and workshops for understanding the complex medical and social issues faced by medically underserved communities in our state. Our mobile health units are run by program coordinators and health educati on professionals in addition to student volunteers from all UA Health Sciences colleges (Public Health, Nursing, Medicine, and Pharmacy). Most recently, the UA College of Public Health's Community Advisory Board has partnered with local Walgreens in an ef fort to promote awareness of the mobile health unit and its programs by offering the flu vaccine and wellness events ahead of flu season to businesses in our community. Our first event this past September was very well attend with 60 participants receivin g flu vaccines and 30+ also receiving other wellness checks that included BMI, blood pressure and glucose checks. This event allowed us to serve a community not typically targeted by our mobile health unit and raise awareness of its services and programs. Albuterol in Schools - Professor Lynn Gerald is an internationally recognized researcher in the field of school -based asthma research. Dr. Gerald along with her students conducted a pilot program in the Tucson and Sunnyside unified school districts i n 2014 to study the effects of having inhalers stocked in schools. During the program's first year, school health administrators used stock inhalers on 222 asthma attacks. Ambulance transportation fell 40 percent, and 911 calls fell 20 percent. Based on th ese data, Dr. Gerald recruited Pima County Health authorities and local advocacy groups interested in respiratory health and together they contacted members of the Arizona House of Representatives. Her team had interviewed with dozens of legislators, schoo l organizations and school districts. This led to the recent (2018) approval of House Bill 2208 by the Arizona Legislature. The legislation ensures that bronchodilator therapy can be safely provided to students having asthma attacks at schools throughout Arizona. In addition, Professor Gerald with funding from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute worked to promote community empowerment collaborations to reduce childhood asthma disparities among in the Navajo Nation. Although the Nation is served by the Indian Health Service, its population is dispersed in 27,000 square miles of territory in 3 States. In this situation, the only feasible strategy to treat chronic childhood disease such as asthma is to empower local communities with knowledge about the disease and with instruments to prevent and treat acute exacerbations. Lynn and her collaborators at National Jewish partnered with Navajo Nation authorities and Navajo health professionals. They participated in dozens of meetings with most of the more th an 100 local Nation Chapters. 306 Partnership with Pima Animal Care Center (PACC) - The College and the Pima Animal Care Center (PACC) have formed a partnership to allow graduate students to participate in research projects at the animal shelter as part of t heir One Health program coursework. The core concept of the One Health approach is that multiple disciplines collaborate at the local, national and international level to improve the health of humans, animals and the environment. This course teaches stude nts about the complex relationships between humans, animals, and the environment for everything from infectious diseases to the importance of the human -animal interaction in various aspects of health and well -being. This partnership will expose students t o a new paradigm of animal and human welfare. It also fulfills the mission of our college to work hand -in-hand with the community to address important public health issues. The Canyon Ranch Center for Prevention and Health Promotion is dedicated to helpi ng people achieve and maintain healthy lives by providing a variety of opportunities that facilitate and support growth toward health and well -being. The center has partnered with local health service providers, other colleges within the university, and fa ith-based organizations to deliver quality health education in the area of diet, physical activity and obesity prevention. The goal of the CRCPHP is to promote health and wellness in the greater Tucson area, thus establishing Tucson as the center of wellne ss for the U.S. The Center recently implemented an evidence based, comprehensive school obesity prevention program that began this fall 2018 academic year in Tucson, Arizona schools - Project Healthy Schools (PHS) . PHS has five main goals of dissemination and implementation to school age children. 1) Eat more fruits and vegetables, 2) Choose less sugary foods and beverages, 3) Eat less fast and fatty food, 4) Be active every day, and 5) Spend less time in front of a scr een. Project Healthy Schools has been adapted and implemented at Saints Peter and Paul School by our Service Based Learning Students. PHS is designed to also work with the parents and guardians of the students to help establish a healthy lifestyle for the entire family. The Healthy 2B Me Wellness Camp is designed for kids in grades 2 -5. The Healthy 2B Me camp recently completed its 6th year of service to underserved children in Tucson. Over 300 youth age 7 -11 years have participated in the camp since 2013. Most participants live below the poverty line. Activities are designed to engage children to learn about wellness, including nutrition, cooking, swimming and a variety of physical activities. This past summer nearly 60 children participated in our 4 week -long sessions. In 2018, we continued our collaboration with a local elementary school as part of their summer school curriculum, which serves children primarily from the Middle East and Africa. We have been able to tailor the camp curriculum to meet the pu blic health needs expressed by the school community including additional support in pedestrian safety, personal hygiene and health communication. In addition, 12 children from Nogales, AZ participated in Healthy 2B Me , exposing these children to curriculum not available in Santa Cruz County. Thematic days included nutrition and physical activity, germs and hygiene, sun safety, tobacco prevention, and kindness. Community support has been tremendous with scholarships covering all of the participants' cost. The Girls Club school -based bullying prevention program is closely looking into bullying among adolescent girls - an important public health challenge. Of particular concern is a distinct form of bullying known as relational aggression. Relationally aggress ive girls can give dirty looks, pass cruel notes, and spread hurtful rumors. Behaviors are often unrecognized as bullying, or are dismissed as typical female behavior. It has the potential to negatively affect academic performance and mental health. These consequences are not limited to the victim, but also include the bully. The program's goal is to reduce risk factors for high risk behaviors, reduce bully victimization and promote protective factors among fifth and sixth grade girls involved in the Girls Club, an after -school program. The Girls Club meets annually from September to April on Mondays for two hours. We are in our sixth year of delivering the Girls Club program at Estes Elementary School in Marana. On average 35 girls in grades five and six e nroll each year. We bring the students to the University for a field trip every year. MPH students serve as Group Leaders under the direction of Dr. Velia Nuno, the director of the MCH concentration. The program applies a pre -post design whereby pre -test measures gathered via a survey were collected before the program, and post -test measures are planned for March of every year. Parents are included as part of the evaluation process at the end of the program. This successful community -based program attest s to the strong established partnership between the community and the College. New this year is the revision of the \"development\" lessons. Partnership with Navajo Nation - This project involved working with the Navajo Nation on assessing exposure and ri sk perceptions following the Gold King Mine spill in August 2015. The mine leaked three million gallons of polluted water into a tributary of the Animas River in Colorado. The water traveled into the San Juan and Colorado rivers, flowing along the borders of 12 Native American Tribes. Dr. Paloma Beamer, associate professor of environmental health, and Dr. Karletta Chief, a Navajo hydrologist and 307 associate professor in the Department of Soil, Water and Environmental Science, lead a cross -disciplinary team t o address tribal questions regarding the impact of the environmental disaster on their communities. A network of Din\u00e9 community partners from the affected chapters have guided the university researchers in designing and implementing a culturally appropria te study that addresses the community's concerns. A key focus has been on building capacity for assessing environmental exposures through training of Din\u00e9 tribal college students, environmental interns, and community health representatives. To date more th an 85 students (half Din\u00e9) and 25 community members have collaborated and participated in data collection, interpretation, and dissemination. During 2018, the team has focused on dissemination of results, addressing farmers concerns, and community empowerm ent through development of citizen science protocols. Results have been circulated through several teach -ins, radio forums and most recently and Executive Education Session on Emergency Response for senior Navajo Leadership. The team has partnered with sev eral Navajo farmers to monitor their water, soil, and corn over the growing season. Data has been collected by teams of Din\u00e9 College interns and Navajo Community Health Representatives. Reflecting on the experience one student noted, \"The field work experi ence, collecting river and irrigation samples, testing the samples, starting the data input process has been most informative, I've definitely learned so many new things this past week and I'm exiting and looking forward to many more years of expanding my knowledge and gaining more life experiences. This is just the tip of the iceberg. I would like to thank the University of Arizona team and the Din\u00e9 College, our mentors for giving me this incredible opportunity. The experience is one I will not forget.\" Di n\u00e9 College Intern. Center for Rural Health (CRH): The Arizona Center for Rural Health (AzCRH) serves Arizona through its core mission to improve the health and wellness of rural and underserved Arizona populations. Chartered as the Rural Health Office in 1982 with an ongoing state appropriation, it was designated as the Center for Rural Health in 2011, receiving the National Rural Health Association's Outstanding Rural Health Organization Award in 2013. AzCRH houses programs and initiatives funded by st ate, federal, and foundation sources. Daniel Derksen, M.D., is the Walter H. Pearce Endowed Chair and Director of AzCRH. Programs and Initiatives Housed in AzCRH: 1) The Arizona State Office of Rural Health (AzSORH) has been continuously funded since 1990 under the authority of federal and state legislation and 1:3 federal: state matched funding. MEZCOPH is one of just two U.S. colleges of public health housing a State Office of Rural Health. AzSORH collects and disseminates rural health information, coord inates rural health activities in the state, provides technical assistance to rural communities and entities providing rural health services including federally designated Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), Rural Health Clinics (RHCs), Indian Health Service and 638 Self Determination clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), county health departments, state agencies, and private providers, practices, businesses and others. 2) The Arizona Rural Hospital Flexibility Program (AzFlex) - for over 20 ye ars the Center has worked with Arizona's rural and Critical Access Hospitals. There are currently 15 federally designated CAHs with 17 affiliated Rural Health Clinics in Arizona. AzFlex assists and provides technical assistance in quality, financial and op erational improvement, emergency medical services integration, and addressing needs as identified in catchment area health needs assessments - such as opioid overdose, morbidity and mortality. 3) AzCRH collaborates via interagency partnerships with the Ari zona Department of Health Services (ADHS) in initiatives funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to address Arizona's opioid epidemic: providing free online conti nuing medical education (CME) modules through a virtual lecture hall on the appropriate prescribing of controlled substances; training first responders to administer naloxone for opioid overdoses and provide screening, brief intervention and referral for t reatment (SBIRT) to get those with opioid use disorder into appropriate treatment; participating in the ADHS Prescription Drug Misuse/Abuse Initiative. 4 ) AzCRH trains health professions students as certified assisters to help uninsured individuals with he alth insurance related eligibility questions and enroll in Medicaid (AHCCCS), CHIP (KidsCare) and ACA Marketplace coverage. These efforts have helped Arizona gain coverage, and almost halved Arizona's uninsured rate to 10%. 5) AzCRH administers MEZCOPH's R ural Health Professions Program (RHPP) and Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Scholars Program , and the five service learning courses that provide community -engaged experiences for public health students. 6) AzCRH convenes annual statewide meetings attend ed by over 300 participants. In July, 2018 it held the 45 th Annual Rural Health Conference in Flagstaff, AZ and has its Rural and Public Health Policy Conference at the state capitol during the legislative session each January. Arizona Smoker's Helpline (ASHLine): The Arizona Smokers' Helpline (ASHLine) is one of over 50 quit lines across the United States. Established in 1995, it is also one of the oldest and most seasoned quit 308 lines in existence. As a member of the North Ameri can Quit line Consortium, ASHLine is actively engaged in collaborations, research, evaluation and quality improvement to assure all Arizonans have access to high quality, evidence -based tobacco cessation services and support. Nationally, quit rates reporte d among North American quit lines vary, averaging around 30%. The Arizona Smokers' Helpline (ASHLine) has been helping people quit tobacco since its inception in 1995. ASHLine is a comprehensive quit line, offering free telephone (both reactive and proact ive) and web -based quit services and four to twelve weeks Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). In addition, ASHLine has fax and electronic provider referral program and provides free training and technical assistance to healthcare providers and community partners statewide. We just recently signed an agreement with the Arizona Department of Health Services to develop a Tobacco Cessation Center that will include a tobacco cessation training institute in addition to ASHLine services. Partnering with Skilled nursing facilities to address antibiotic resistance: Dr. Katherine Ellingson, assistant professor of epidemiology at MEZCOPH and her team are partnering with skilled nursing facilities in Arizona to develop an antibiotic stewardship program, or \"playbook, \" for prescribing antibiotics to treat infectious diseases. Skilled nursing facility residents are at heightened risk for acquiring antibiotic -resistant infections, including pathogens recently dubbed \"nightmare bacteria\" by the CDC. Residents are also at higher risk for antibiotic -associated adverse events like Clostridium difficile, commonly known as C. diff. Symptoms can range from diarrhea to a dangerous and potentially fatal inflammation of the colon. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv ices instituted a requirement for all U.S. skilled nursing facilities to implement an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) by November 2017 as a condition of reimbursement. However, a recent survey found only a quarter of Arizona skilled nursing facilities reported any preparation for ASP implementation. The main goal is to rigorously evaluate implementation of this protocol in 16 Arizona skilled nursing facilities with an eye toward developing a playbook for stewardship that can be feasibly implemented in these unique and resource -limited settings. Western Regional Public Health Training Center (WRPHTC) provides and monitors need -based trainings for current and future public health professionals. The WRPHTC recorded more than 43,000 registrations for their courses during the past fiscal year. In 201 8, the Western Region Public Health Training Center (WRPHTC) received continuation funds to support the HRSA Region 9. The WRHTC has recently leveraged its eight -year history of training the public health workforce to develop a training in collaboration with the CDC on Legionella for public health workers and facility management personnel who oversee the water systems in hotels, health care facilities and other industrial facilities. Each year the WRPHTC provides stipends for students to participate in community -based internships. These internships take place with government and non -governmental agencies. Examples of specific locations have included the Children's Medical Center, Arizona Department of Health Services Office of Border Health, the Desert Se nita Community Health Center, Tucson Medical Center's Outpatient Breastfeeding Clinic, Ministry of Health for the Federated States of Micronesia, El Rio Community Health Center, and the Mohave County Health Department. Students develop short video present ations of their experiences and can be viewed on the WRPHTC Website . The WRPHTC has also acquired a 3 -year grant to support 120 nurses to become certified Forensic Sexual Assault Nurse Exami ners (SANEs). This grant has 3 parts: (1) providing the technical training to nurses to conduct the exams, collect forensic evidence and make the appropriate referrals for victims, (2) develop an application that will provide the SANEs with the emotional support that is required for health professionals who are exposed to traumatic events to improve their mental health and to help retain qualified SANEs, and (3) to have SANEs become community educators to inform students and other community members about sexual assault in hopes that we can have a small impact on prevention and to have more women feel comfortable about coming forward to report sexual assaults. This timely outreach program is another avenue in which MEZCOPH is working with community -level p rofessionals to meet gaps in health care needs. The SANE program will provide opportunities for students to help develop education materials for nurses and to work with various Sexual Assault Response Teams (SARTs) in the state. Arizona Prevention Resea rch Center (AzPRC ): The AzPRC partners with communities to improve the health and well -being of people living in the U.S. -Mexico Border states through research, training, advocacy and policy change. The AzPRC houses diverse programs and activities that use community - based participatory action research to focus on the prevention of chronic disease in the border region. Together with partner community health centers, grassroots agencies and county health 309 departments, the AzPRC developed th e now evidence -based Community Health Worker Prevention Curriculum \" Pasos Adelante\" (Steps Forward) to encourage healthy behaviors as well as \" Acci\u00f3n para la Salud\" , a curriculum guide designed to train CHWs to engage community members in policy change to address community health. The AzPRC formed and coordinates a coalition of 250 organizations that serves as the catalyst for recognition and sustainability of community health workers throughout the state through legislative and foundation initiatives. The coalition successfully advocated for CHW Voluntary Certification in Arizona, which was signed into law in April, 2018. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area.

Assessment of the Community's Professional Development Needs The school periodically assesses the professional development needs of individuals currently serving public health functions in its self -defined priority community or communities. 1) Define the school's professional community or communities of interest and the rationale for this choice. The primary geographic focus on workforce development is Arizona, including Tribal Health Departments. Additionally, the Western Region Public Health Training Center continually assesses professional development for the he alth departments for HRSA Region 9 (Arizona, Nevada, California, Hawaii and the US Associated Pacific Islands). As the central office for the WRPHTC, the College works with partners in each jurisdiction to carry out needs assessments and to provide continuing education programs. For This focus is in line with our college's mission. 2) Describe how the school periodically assesses the professional development needs of its priority community or communities, and provide summary results of these assessments. Describe how often assessment occurs . The Western Region Public Health Training Center has conducted num erous needs assessments in collaboration with its partners. Within HRSA Region 9 using it s Public Health Core Competency Self - Assessment and Training Preferences Survey (PHCCSTPS). The timing of these assessments is an iterative process that is based on being asked by health departments to support their workforce development. This survey ass esses the strengths and weaknesses of state, county, and tribal health departments' workforce. This needs assessment survey, as its name suggests, includes training preferences questions and a self -assessment of public health core competencies as identifie d by the Public Health Foundation. The survey was first utilized by three Arizona county health departments prior to the project start in September 2014. Beginning in 2015, the survey was programmed into and administered using Qualtrics. The Central Office evaluator writes up an individualized analysis report for each local health department that distributes the survey, to provide a framework for them to develop or revise existing workforce development plans . Initial Assessments Nineteen (1 9) Training Needs Assessments were conducted within state, county, and tribal health departments in Arizona, California, and Nevada using the PHCCSTPS, with a total of 2,383 respondents during between 2013 and 2018. Each health department was presented wit h a written report of their findings. In Arizona, 14 assessments were completed in Arizona with a total of 1,616 respondents. This included eight county health departments (Apache, Cochise, Gila, Mohave, Navajo, and Pasqua Yaqui), one IHS facility (Chinle Service Unit), and the state health department (Arizona Department of Health Services). Two of these county HDs have repeated the survey twice, and one has completed it thrice to analyze their workforce development needs. Among the Arizona public health workforce, the need for trainings is greatest in the areas of public health sciences, financial planning and management, and analysis and assessment. In Nevada , a comprehensive analysis r eport for the 526 assessments they received from distributing the PHCCSTPS. As with Arizona, the analysis indicated that the need for training was greatest in the areas of public health sciences, financial planning and management, and analysis and assessme nt. The needs assessment findings were disseminated to Nevada's health jurisdictions and meetings were conducted with each jurisdiction to identify and arrange provision of the trainings most needed. In California , a modified PHCCSTPS was sent to Californ ia's 60 public health officers for approval. In the second and third years of the grant, the health departments in the California counties of Mariposa, Shasta, 312 and Tuolumne were surveyed. Individual analysis reports based on 125 total responses were writte n and provided to the respective county health departments by the Central Office. In Hawaii, the WRPHTC supported the Hawaii Public Health Training Hui to conduct a separate needs assessment survey. This survey was used in 2012 and again in 2015, with th e addition of some questions from the AzPHTC's PHCCSTPS. HiPHTH also assessed the need for additional training topics, by surveying attendees after each training. The top training topics identified included: a) leadership, b) recovery from mental illness a nd substance use, c) opioid use and control, d) mental health issues, and e) use of motivation. Strategic skills from the de Beaumont Foundation's \"A Call to Action\" were considered for the training topics planned in 2018. ): The 2015 survey described above was distributed to 1,693 PHPs via a Community Partnership listserv and received 509 responses (~30% rate). The responses from this survey indicated that the highest -ranking competency areas were 1) Community Dimensions of Pr actice, 2) Health Communication and Informatics, 3) Leadership and Systems Thinking, and 4) Cultural Competency. These results were used to develop monthly training schedules from 2016 -2018. During project year 3 and 4, at least three trainings were presen ted in Hawai'i for each of the four competency domains. In the USAPI, the results of their needs assessment showed a strong desire for continuing professional development (CPD) and for accredited trainings leading to recognized degrees and certificates. T he identified training areas included public health science skills related to epidemiology in the areas of data collection and assessment, and specifically related to non -communicable diseases (NCDs). During the fourth project year and in the wake of the highly successful Certificate of Professional Practice in the Epidemiology and Control of Non -Communicable Diseases, the PIPHTC undertook a survey of key stakeholders and practitioners from across the region to determine what they would like the next certi ficate program to focus on. Respondents, which included minister and directors of health, public health practitioners, physicians, nurses, and others involved in public health, requested additional training focused on how to develop community - based progra ms focused on lifestyle change leading to better health, reduced prevalence of risk factors for NCDs, and better management of the current population of NCD patients. In the past year, three (3) training needs a ssessments have been conducted within state , county, and tribal health departments in Arizona, California, and Nevada during this project period using the PHCCSTPS, with a total of 81 respondents. These assessments were conducted 1) at an Indian Health Service (IHS) facility in Northern Arizona, 2) at a tribal health department in Southern Arizona, and 3) among the local health officers of California. The latter was completed through the collaboration of the Health Officers Association of California (HOAC), to assess the training needs for Californi a's physician health officers, who are invested with public health authority in California's 58 counties and three city jurisdictions. This self-assessment resulted in a report outlining the training needs of the leadership of California's local health dep artment leadership. This report will be used in the next phase of the project, which will include planning and delivering relevant trainings. A summary of the needs assessments for 11 health departments in Arizona is presented in ERF F3 .2. These results were distributed to members of the Arizona Local Health Officers Association, the county health department directors and other leadership personnel in State and County Health Departments. In April 2019, the WRPHTC implemented the second PHCCSTPS with its partner at the University of Nevada, Reno, throughout the state to address statewide workforce competences and training preferences. The WR PHTC has worked with partners statewide to help ensure workplace buy -in of the asse ssment. On December 14, 20 18, WR PHTC met with partners to review and get feedback on survey questions, implementation dates, and marketing plan. Official announcement of the PHCCSTPS will happen on March 19, 2019 at the County Health Rankings meetings. NVPHTC will have representati ves in both Northern Nevada and Southern Nevada meetings to announce the assessment and provide an orientation. In addition, Nevada has added questions to their standard training evaluation form to ask about trainings needs. Over summer 2019, WR PHTC will be reviewing PHCCSTPS results and training evaluations for continued improvement of trainings and delivery formats. Additional assessments have been conducted by the WRPHTC's CBT partners to inform training needs and determine training topics. The Hawaii State Rural Health Association (HSRHA) completed an online survey in late 2018 to past 313 participants of the \"Project ECHO Hawaii Behavioral Health and Opioid Misuse and Substance Use Disorders Integrated Series\" to inquire what specific specialized skills t raining topics would be of interested in the future. The findings were used to develop future training curriculum, as well as to identify complementary learning materials (e.g., short videos) that will be utilized to further engage providers and stimulate dialogue during the training sessions, in addition to reinforcing what was taught. Future training topics may include: community resources, addition/substance abuse, dosing/safety, opioid basics, and local opioid control updates. The Arizona Foundation of Human Service Providers (AFHSP) is currently administering a survey to determine the training needs of mid -level managers working in mental health organizations in Arizona. The HOAC similarly has conducted an assessment to determine the topics for the semi -annual Continuing Medical Education training events of the local health officers, which will be focusing on homelessness in spring 2019 and climate change in fall 2019. The Hawaii Public Health Institute (HIPHI) plans to conduct a needs assessment in fall 2019 to develop future trainings. The WRPHTC supported the Pacific Islands Public He alth Training Centre (PIPHTC) to conduct an email - based survey of 125 public health leaders and practitioners, physicians, nurses, and other allied health providers invol ved in the provision of public health and preventative services in the United States Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI) to determine desired continuing professional development training needs for 2019 - 2020. The survey had a 57% response rate (72 responses) . The top four identified areas included: (1) additional trainings in community health and development, with an emphasis on non -communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity; (2) trainings in infectious diseases, such as infection con trol, outbreak management, and environmental health; (3) public health basics, such as the essential public health functions; and (4) public health law and legislation, such as developing legislative interventions. At this time, the PIPHTC is developing a dditional trainings dealing with community health and development that focus on non -communicable diseases (NCD). In Spring/Summer 2019) , the WRPHTC conducted a needs assessment with Arizona Council of Human Service Providers (ACHSP) for mental health frontline and supervisors. Results were from 330 frontline mental health providers, 224 supervisors and 127 directors /senior leaders working in private non -profit and for-profit organizations. Preliminary result s are ERF F3.2 (ACHSP Report_Draft ). Direct mental health providers identified their greatest rewards were from their relations hip with coworkers and clients and the mission of their organizations with their major challenge being salary. These results indicated that t he skills supervisors most needed to improve their ability to work effectively were how to communicate effectively, active listening, problem solving, developing employee strengths, conflict management and managing employees of which 45% surveyed indicated that these skills were extremely needed. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area.

Delivery of Professional Development Opportunities for the Workforce The school advances public health by addressing the professional development needs of the current public health workforce, broadly defined, based on a ssessment activities described in Criterion F3. Professional development offerings can be for -credit or not -for-credit and can be one -time or sustained offerings. 1) Describe the school's process for developing and implementing professional development activ ities for the workforce and ensuring that these activities align with needs identified in Criterion F3. The College's workforce development initiatives are aligned with its mission to promoting the health of communities in the southwest and globally with an emphasis on achieving health equity through excellence in education, research and service, by: Strengthening the infrastructure of frontline public health organizations with particular emphasis on our state, county and tribal health depar tments and community health centers. Building core competencies (knowledge, skills and abilities) of public health professionals, both discipline specific and interdisciplinary, utilizing a variety of modalities. Creating partnerships with state, county an d tribal public health services and community -based organizations to assess and address the needs of the workforce. Providing education and training opportunities to the wider body of health care professionals, community service providers and community mem bers to disseminate promising practices in public health and foster trans -disciplinary, population -based approaches to promoting healthy communities and addressing health disparities. Faculty members throughout the College are engaged in professional development opportunities for the workforce. In addition to supporting the academic and public health workforce by presenting at conferences, 29 faculty members have worked directly with organizations to advance workforce development during th e past 3 academic years (nearly 50% of all faculty members) . These faculty reached 4,988 people and with a cumulative number of 155,466 contact hours. Examples of organizations touched by MEZCOPH faculty include health departments, fire departments, and school districts. Faculty also provide presentations at local, state and national conferences who participants public health practitioners and academics. MEZCOPH has created an academic health department with Pima County. A joint seminar series has grown out of this relationship that provides opportunities for continuing education to the workforce and the MEZCOPH faculty through shared sessions. We are also supporting similar relationships by supporting the Western Region Academic Health Department (AHD) Summit. We also have conducted trainings school staff to use stock albuterol for children who are having asthma episodes. A HRSA funded project has also allowed MEZCOPH to provide continuing education to nurses so they may become certified sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) in collaboration with the International Association of Forensic Nurses. The college also supports a series of conference s and seminars. These include the annual James Dalen Lecture, our annual Social Justice Conference, the Bi -annual Arizona Public Health Association conferences, the Annual Arizona Rural Health Conference. Most recently, MEZCOPH supported a public forum on the public health impact of the current US immigration policy, and the 10th Annual Border Health: Information for Action conference in Nogales, Sonora, Mex ico, a two-day conference brought together public health professionals from both s ides of the U.S. -Mexico border to share their work, ideas, and explore innovative ways to work together to strengthen binational collaboration in the Arizona -Sonora region. The college was also home of the Mountain West Preparedness and Emergency Respons e Learning Center . The learning center was one of 14 serving in a national capacity for preparedness and response training and education needs of the U. S. public health workforce. The learning centers provided unique workforce development needs by offerin g assistance to nearby state, local, and tribal public health 316 authorities. The online courses available through the center are still available on our College's Moodle site. Additionally, w orkforce development activities occur in strategic fashion by the College's Western Region Public Health Training Center (WRPHTC). It uses results provided from faculty through community presentations, professional presentations and in conjunction with the WRPHTC. Between 201 6 and 2018, faculty members provided trainings to The WRPHTC had a total of 138,495 training registrants from the 2,842 trainings provided during between 2014 and 2018. The development of courses is based on the needs assessments that are conducted by the training center and also from national reports of training needs, and input from the training center's advisory board . 65% of the trainings were delivered in the format of a self -paced distance learning course, while 28% were class -room based or in -person conferences and/or workshops, 3% were hybrid cour ses, and 4% were real -time distance learning courses. The majority of these courses addressed Community Dimensions of Practice skills. The next most common public health core competency skills addressed in our courses included Public Health Sciences skills , Analytical and Assessment skills, and Communication skills. These courses targeted Tier 1 public health professionals (70%) and Tier 2 managers and supervisors (26%). In Arizona, courses had a total of 91,997 registrants for 1900 training courses. 154 of these courses were approved for Continuing Education credit. There were 47 in -person workshops (1,409 P ublic Health Providers (P HPs) ) on topics including Public Health Essentials in Action, Meeting Facilitation, Parent Ambassadors, and Mindfulness. Als o, two of these in -person trainings consisted of series for tribal public health workers on program planning and evaluation, policy and advocacy, and creating a program budget. 14 live -streamed webinars (1,250 PHPs) were recorded and archived on a variety of topics within our content area of nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. These included webinars on policies for obesity prevention, breastfeeding in Mexico, dynamic energy balance in practice, weight loss and weight management, successful nutritio n programs for Native American and Pacific Islander communities, cultural competence, and communication skills. The WRPHTC also developed over 25 asynchronous trainings, hosted on TRAIN and the WRPHTC's new LMS on Moodle. We worked with Maricopa County He alth Department to develop a course on Return on Investment that offers 12 modules that can be taken individu ally or as a complete course. The WRPHTC also worked with the Pima County Immigrant Victims of Violence Taskforce to create an online training for providers on how to serve immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence. A quality improvement training made of 11 micro -learning videos on topics including radar and run charts, force field analysis, prioritization matrices, affinity and scatter diagr ams was created and made available on TRAIN. Asynchronous trainings were also created on the topics of administering stock albuterol to students by non-licensed school personnel, dietary assessment methods, best practices in program planning for localized obesity prevention, the role of local health departments in strengthening local food systems to improve the food security and nutritional status of their communities, using health apps in dietetic practice, prioritization and time management, evaluating fa d diets, interventions for post -partum weight retention, Acanthosis Nigricans, and addressing sexual violence for community health workers. In Arizona, the Mariposa Community Health Center and Pima Community Access Program developed an Affordable Care Act (ACA) Training for Community Trainers (in English and Spanish). This training was used in coordination with the Arizona Center for Rural Health's Students Helping Arizona Register Everyone (SHARE) project, which trains health professions students (undergr aduate senior or graduate students in public health, medicine, nursing, or pharmacy) to become Certified Application Counselors for the Marketplace. The AzPHTC sponsored 121 students through this certification training. In collaboration with the Arizona L ocal Health Officers Association (ALHOA), AzPHTC offered a 3 -part, hybrid training series on Leadership with topics being public health law, negotiation and communication strategies, and succession planning. The participant cohort was selected by ALHOA and had the opportunity to be mentored by health officers. National subject matter experts (SMEs) were invited to record a lecture that was accessible to participants online before a live, virtual discussion and case study with the SME. The training center a lso organized and implemented a virtual conference to discuss and develop skills needed by the public health workforce to tackle disparities in diet -related disease and food 317 access after being awarded the Serving Those Who Serve Others grant by iCohere, a provider of a cloud - based Unified Learning Management System. Presentations and sponsorships were provided at a number of conferences (2,290 PHPs), including the Center for Integrative Medicine's Nutrition and Health Conference in 2015; the Arizona Publi c Health Association (AzPHA) Spring and Fall conferences in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018; the Arizona Center for Rural Health's annual Arizona Rural Health Conference in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 and their Policy Forum in 2015; the University of Arizona Soc ial Justice Symposium in 2016, 2017 and 2018; the 2016 Arizona Health Equity Conference; and the 2017 Arizona Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Annual Meeting. In Nevada, the WRPHTC with its partner at the University of Nevada, Reno Nevada Public Health Training Center (NvPHTC) trained 13,775 PHPs via 197 programs over a 4-year period. The training modalities are primarily in person and include small group and interactive activities. Training topics vary and include topics such as health disparities, cultural competency, minority health issues, healthy aging and mental health. NvPHTC partnered with local organizations to develop trainings that are relevant to the current population based on the knowledge of the local organizations. In addition, the training center has partnered in the development of public health pipeline programs with high school students interested in health care. The NvPHTC also jointly provided web -based, real -time training s with Project ECHO each month during the second, third, and fourth project years. These webinars were well attended (around 30 PHPs per session with at least 12 sessions per year), and received positive feedback on the quality, quantity, and usefulness of the information. The NvPHTC also developed a few self -paced online trainings and held three conferences in Nevada, on effective program planning and evaluation and using frontline health workers to improve community health and chronic disease management. In California, The WRPHTC in conjunction with the California Publi c Health Training Center (CaPHTC ) housed at the State AHEC office, the CaPHTC together with its 6 AHEC partners trained 13,933 professionals during this project through the 519 courses. Top ics included quality improvement, women's health, communication, rural health, IHSS caregiving, health coaching, wellness, medical transportation, health screenings, outreach & enrollment, and opioid abuse. The majority of the trainings implemented by the CaPHTC were in -person workshops, but there were also a significant number of webinars and self -paced courses developed during the project. The topics of these courses included HPV vaccination, domestic abuse screening, PH infrastructure, care and support of elders, social determinants of health, veteran's mental health, and trauma informed care, among others. The CA State Office of Rural Health contracted CaPHTC to provide three webinars for rural and frontier health professionals and staff working in FQHC s, Rural Health Clinics, IHS sites, and LHDs. CaPHTC worked with the Central Office on a cultural competence in care settings webinar. The CaPHTC's contracted six sites and provided trainings with 2,859 PH and healthcare professionals on IHSS caregiving, w ellness, communications, health screenings, opioid abuse, QI and PCMH. In Hawaii, 13,536 registrations for trainings occurred via 93 trainings in the first four years. Most training topics were identified from its needs assessment while others were based on stakeholder requests. Training topics included topics such as indigenous health, nutrition and physical activity, health li teracy, mental health, cultural competency, and leadership. Monthly trainings were offered in three modalities during the first two project years, using Eventbrite as the registration site \u2014face-to-face, webinar, and video -teleconferencing through both the State of Hawai'i's Telehealth Access Network and Information and Communication Services Division. In the third and fourth project years, a bi -modality approach was used where trainings were simultaneously offered in -person or via Zoom webinar. This allowe d for the best state -wide access for all the islands in Hawaii and increased attendance by more than 30%. Trainings were recorded through Zoom and posted at https://www.youtube.com/user/vyontz1 . Priority topics from the fourth year of the project are also posted on the WRPHTC's Moodle site. Results from tracking the common metrics indicated 88% or higher satisfaction rate for the programs. Several of these programs provided continuing education (CEs) cr edits for trainings for the following health professional groups: Certified Substance Abuse Counselors (CSAC), Licensed Social Workers (LSW), 318 Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW), Certified Health Education Specialist (CHES), Registered Dieticians (RD) , Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDN), Dietetic Technicians Registered (DTR), Registered Nurses (RN), and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN). In the USAPI, the PIPHTC has trained 5,254 PHPs via 133 trainings during the project across four tim e zones including participants from CNMI, Guam, Republic of Palau, all four of the FSM States plus the FSM National Government, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Most training topics are pre -set providing foundational training to a PH workforce, mo st of whom do not have formal training in PH. Courses have been classroom -based or self -paced online on topics including epidemiology, data collection, and data assessments. A Certificate of Professional Practice in the Epidemiology and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases and a Certificate of Professional Practice in Community Health and Development were developed as a response to assessment results. The latter was a twelve -lesson course focused on evidence -based practice to alter lifestyle risk factors based around the specific needs of the US -Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI). Lessons are distributed as a reading packet via email. The reading packet includes a 12 -20-page lesson, links to additional resources, samples of successful community -based pr ograms, checklists for implementation, and concludes with a self -assessment and reflective writing exercise that requires participants to discuss how they would use the principles contained in the lesson in the development of a community -based lifestyle ch ange project. Participants who complete all lessons have developed a full proposal for a community -based project, including planning, implementation and assessment activities. 100% of new trainings have been developed from stakeholder feedback and assess ment and focus on both community health and development programs that focus on nutrition, physical activity, and obesity, or the epidemiology and control of non -communicable diseases. Many partnerships were developed to implement trainings at PIPHTC. They included the School of Public Health and Primary Care at Fiji National Univers ity, University of Hawai'i at Ma noa Office of Public Health Studies (UHM -OPHS), University of Hawaii, College of Micronesia -FSM (COM -FSM), Micronesia Area Health Edu cation Center, PCC and College of the Marshall Islands AHECs, Pacific Basin Medical Association (PBMA), Pacific Basin Public Health Association (PBPHA), PH leaders who encourage staff to take CEUs, and lastly the groups that supported the PIHOA -organized D DM program delivered in Palau, Guam and Pohnpei State, FSM, to enhance the epidemiological capacity of the PH workforce \u2014these groups were the CDC, WHO, Secretariat of the Pacific Community, FNU, PIHOA, University of Guam, and University of New South Wales Recent Approaches and Training Developments The College's Western Region Public Health Training Center has had over 9,000 training registrants from new trainings provided since July 1, 2018. These numbers include 15 newly developed asynchronous online cou rses, 34 webinar or hybrid courses, and 40 in -person workshops. It does not include those trained via asynchronous courses and archived webinar developed before the start of the project period, which are still available via the WRPHTC Moodle LMS. The WRPH TC has developed 5 online, self -paced trainings during the project thus far. These trainings are on the topics of Legionella management, public health competencies, learning strategies for using multimedia in health promotion, and performance improvement. A webinar on promoting resiliency after mass trauma following the California wildfires was organized with the help of the Southwest Telehealth Resource Center (261 PHPs). An in -person workshop on understanding opioid -use disorder was provided with the help o f Sonoran Prevention Works to case managers at a homeless shelter (43 PHPs). The NVPHTC with support from the WRPHTC has implemented 7 Public Health ECHO Clinics since July 1, 2018 (1,363 participants). Project ECHO Clinics have created opportunities for participants to connect and collaborate on future initiatives. The November 2019 Public Health ECHO on the syphilis outbreaks in Nevada brought together several community agencies to form a new workgroup specifically for this issue. NVPHTC has presented at 9 in-person Public Health 101 trainings with roughly 40 participants at each event. NVPHTC hosted an Antimicrobial Resistance Summit in Reno (41 participants) and Las Vegas (76 participants) focused on a systems thinking approach to addressing antimicrob ial stewardship in Nevada. As of February 2019, 109 users have enrolled in NV's self -paced training \"How to Help Clients Living with Communicable Diseases\". 319 In California, the WRPHTC supported the CaPHTC, together with its 5 AHEC partn ers to train over 2, 300 professionals during this project period. Trainings included webinars on sexually transmitted infections, psychedelics as medicine, and pediatric ADHD, as well as in -person trainings on public health 101, senior health, grant writing, treating patients with opioid use disorder, and rural health. A self -paced training on nutrition for the elderly was also developed, in addition to an immunization media campaign and community -based immunization curriculum. The HOAC trained 53 health officers during a 3 -day fall conference focused on disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. There were an additional two trainings implemented on \"Improving Community Health: Linking Public Health and the Health Care System to Prevent Chronic Disease\" (114 participants) a nd \"Sonoma County Oral Health Leaders in Action\" (137 participants). In Hawaii, over 31 new public health trainings have been offered during this project. This includes 8 hybrid courses on a variety of topics including health communications, change mana gement in prevention of youth violence and suicide, opioid abuse solutions, mental health, diabetes emotional quotient, and more, available both in -person or via Zoom, which were attended by 2,059 PHPs. It also includes a mini - conference organized by HIPHI on Hawaii's youth vaping epidemic, attended by 215 PHPs. An additional mini-conference on the youth vaping epidemic was presented by HIPHI, in partnership with the Kauai Rural Health Association ( 91 participants). The WRPHTC provided support to the Chil dren Healthy Living (CHL) Program to conduct a workshop for Head Start teachers and staff on \"Communicating BMI to Parents\" (23 participants), to increase preschool teacher knowledge of how child BMI is calculated, how to determine a child's weight categor y (using CDC Growth Charts), and how to communicate these findings to parents/caregivers of young children, as well as for Head Start parents on what BMI is and why it matters was also conducted (16 participants). Two 3 - day anthropometric measurement works hops were offered in Hawaii (7 PHPs) and Guam (15 PHPs) to train participants to collect data on anthropometry, acanthosis nigricans, diet, and relevant survey information. Two online courses were offered through the CHL Summer Institute, including \"the Sc ience of Human Nutrition\" (33 participants) and \"Culture and Child Health in the Pacific\" (13 PHPs). The College's training center support s the Hawaii Rural Health Association to implement 15 integrated trainings that included discussion s of opioid misuse and substance use disorders, obesity, or building of infrastructure and systems management as part of the Project ECHO Hawaii Behavioral H ealth series. With the support of the college's training center, the PIPHTC trained 384 PHPs via 13 trainings during the project. This includes online modules from the certificate programs for Community Health and Development on topics such as starting and maintaining coalitions, social action programs, and conducting focus groups. It also includes in -person trainings on cognitive -behavioral therapy, anxiety, and stress - reduction techniques; integrated management of childhood illness for Community Health Workers; and influenza prevention. Certificate Programs MEZCOPH prov ides four non -degree, credit -bearing graduate certificates. These are designed to support working public health professionals with continuing education. The certificates include (1) an online 15 - credit Graduate Certificate in Public Health,15 credits that can also be used toward an MPH at MEZCOPH; (2) a 13 -credit Clinical and Translational Research Graduate Certificate that \" prepares interprofessional scientists for the complexities of clinical and translational research through high -quality didactic inst research experiences\"; (3) a 13 -credit distance learning Graduate Certificate in Global Health and Development that \"that provides participants the foundation knowledge and skills necessary to function effectively in glo bal health practice, whether at home in a diverse setting, along the border in a bi -cultural environment, or abroad where populations are under -resourced and where health systems are constrained\" and (4) a 15-credit Graduate Certificate in Health Administr ation that offers Tucson and Phoenix -based working health professionals an opportunity to advance their health administration training. 320 2) Provide two to three examples of education/training activities offered by the school in the last three years in response to community -identified needs. For each activity, include the number of external participants served (i .e., individuals who are not faculty or students at the institution that houses the school). Three examples of education/training activities t hat exemplify the College's training include the following: Preventing Legionnaires' disease : A Training on Legionella Water Management Programs (PreventLD Training) This training was a collaboration between Colleges Environmental, Exposure, Science and Risk Assessment Center (ESRAC), the WRPHTC and the CDC for a range of professionals involved in water management programs. This training addresses how to reduce risk fo r Legionella in hospitals, retirement homes and long -term care facilities, hotels, high -rise apartment complexes, and other buildings through water management programs. It also helps water management programs align with ASHRAE 188 on reducing risk for Legi onella in building water systems (e.g., potable water, cooling towers, hot tubs, decorative water features). As of March 5, 2019, 914 people had registered with 49 of the 50 states represented . Several partner newsletters have promoted it - including NEHA , ASTHO, NACCHO, APIC and recently ASHRAE and CMS, and even Best Western and the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Training for the Navajo Nation on the Gold King Mine Disaster On August 5, 2015, the Gold King Mine near Silverton, Colorado accidently released three million gallons of acid mine drainage into the San Juan River that borders the northern boundary of the Navajo Nation. The Gold King Mine Spill Din\u00e9 Exposure Project worked with Din\u00e9 communities to address their concerns by 1) det ermining exposure of Din\u00e9 residents living in three impacted Din\u00e9 communities, 2) measuring lead and arsenic in river water, river sediment, agricultural soil, irrigation water, and irrigation sediment, and 3) documenting community concerns. The content wa s developed by the Gold King Mine Spill Din\u00e9 Exposure Project. The Navajo language is traditionally an oral language and to show respect to the community all of the videos were narrated in Navajo with matching English subtitles. David Delmar a respected me mber of Navajo Nation was contracted to assist with the translation and ensure the concepts were appropriately interpreted. The Gold King Mine Spill Din\u00e9 Exposure Project is overseen by the Navajo Nation Human Research Review Board, approval of the videos was received on July 17 th, 2018. These videos were shown at the Gold King Mine Spill Emergency Response Executive Session, which was attended by over 30 Navajo Nation Public Health officials including: Shawnevan Dale, Risk Manager for Navajo Nation Risk M anagement David Nez, Public Health Environmental Program Director for the Navajo Department of Public Health Victoria Lee, Senior Programs & Projects Specialist at the Navajo Epidemiology Center Harlan Cleveland, Emergency Management Director for the Navajo Department of Emergency Management Mae-Gilene Begay, Program Director, Navajo Department of Health Community Health Services We also upload these to YouTube and distribute them at Indian Health Service waiting rooms. Feedback included \"We are grat eful for all the support we received from the WRPHTC, these videos will not only serve as a training mechanism for public health professionals but also as a way to reach the community members that the GKMS DEP is dedicated to. Ahe'hee!\" - Dr. Karletta Chie f. Public Health Essentials in Action The WRPHTC also has offered in -person and online offerings of \"Public Health Essentials in Action.\" This course is described in Section D1 . For workforce development, learners are asked to develop an action plan detailing immediate, short term, and long -term goals that they will strive towards in building a capacity to better serve their public health community. The goals in the action plan r elate to the learner's role in the delivery of services as they relate to the systems management section of the Public Health essentials continuum. 321 To date, 693 public health workforce members have taken this course in person from 10 state, tribal and county health departments. The online version is trickier to track as the training center moved to using Moodle as its learning management system and this includes both students and workforce learnings. This site has 911 registered learners and does not include 4 years of tracking when learners registered using the TRAIN network. 3) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plan s for improvement in this area. Not Applicable 322 G1. DIVERSITY AND CULTURAL COMPETENCE 323 G1. Diversity and Cultural Competence 1) List the school's self -defined, priority under -represented populations; explain why these groups are of particular interest and importance to the school; and describe the process used to define the priority population(s). These populations must include both faculty and students and may include staff, if appropriate. Populations may differ among these groups. MEZCOPH is at the forefront of diversity and inclusion efforts, both at the University of Arizona as well as across CEPH accredited programs. Our students, faculty and staff represent diverse populations that meet or are approaching many of our goals (Sections 1 and 2). Current (Section 4) and planned efforts ( ERF G1) recognize that best practices and approaches to ensuring a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment are dynamic and require us to continuously improve and be responsive to chang ing needs. Our current priority populations include Blacks/African Americans, Native Americans, Latinx, and LGBTQIA+/sexual and gender minorities. These are in alignment with the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHHD). We a re particularly focused on increasing our Native American and Latinx populations as we are a Land Grant University, Hispanic Serving Institution, and we also serve over 20 tribal nations within the boundaries of our State, yet we have not reached parity wi th the Arizona population. According to the US Census, the population of the state of Arizona is 5.3% Native American and 31.6% Hispanic. Although the representation of these groups within MEZCOPH (Table 1) is approaching these percentages we will continue to make these our priority populations until parity is achieved and maintained. MEZCOPH's Committee on Inclusion and Equity (CIE) has historically focused on issues of gender, age, race, and ethnicity but recognizes the multi -dimensional and complex nat ure of diversity. Yet, since our previous accreditation the CIE has worked to more fully identify the diversity of the college and allow monitor of additional populations as described in Table G1. In an effort to better address the multi - dimensional nature of diversity, however, the CIE developed and administered a demographic survey (ERF G1) in February 2019 to measure a more inclusive list of domains listed in the table. The original survey, developed in 2013, was built upon a template developed by the Office of the President, Programs for Inclusive Excellence. The current survey builds upon the 2013 results and reflects the importance for all MEZCOPH members to have more flexibility in how they define themselves rather than limiting them to the traditional questions for gender and race/ethnicity. The survey will continue to be administered on an annual basis. This supplemental data collection will serve to nuance and refine our goals and monitor our progress in the area of equity and inclusion beyond what is just available from the passive data collection systems. As this is a voluntary survey , some individuals may choose not to respond. Table G1. reflects data collected in February 2019, with 448 responses, the response rate was approximately 51%. The results of this survey offer a more complete view of the nature of diversity within MEZCOPH, than other data collected from HR and student records. Based upon the survey results ( Table G1), other priority populations for MEZCOPH include first generation college attendance (undergraduate and graduate) and rural background. Arizona's population is largely rural and there are numerous health disparities in the rural communities that are recognized by the Rural Health Office that is situated within MEZCOPH. There is significant intersectionality between these characteristics and first -generation stat us, making this an additional characteristic to prioritize and monitor. Increasing representation of these populations within MEZCOPH will help us achieve the College 's mission and reduce health disparities in our State. 324 Table G 1. 2019 MEZCOPH Demographic Survey Responses (n=448) Question Responses n % Role within MEZCOPH* Appointed personnel 37 7.3 Classified Staff 35 6.9 Faculty 31 6.0 Student 386 75.7 Other 13 2.6 Student status at MEZCOPH* Undergraduate 238 51.4 Graduate 122 26.4 Age in years <18 2 0.5 18 - 24 222 49.7 25 - 30 49 11.0 31 - 40 66 14.8 41 - 50 24 5.4 51 - 60 11 2.5 61 - 70 8 1.8 >70 1 0.22 Race, Ethnicity and/or origin* American Indian or Alaska Native 21 4.0 Asian or Asian American 53 10.2 Black or African American 23 4.4 Latino/Latina/Latinx, Hispanic or Spanish Origin 126 24.3 Middle Eastern or North African 13 2.5 Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander 3 0.6 White 266 51.3 Other origin 9 1.7 Gender identity Female 359 80.1 Male 77 17.2 Non-binary/Third gender 2 0.5 Prefer to self -identify 7 1.6 Gender or sexual minority Yes 53 11.9 No 369 82.6 Sometimes 19 4.3 Military status Active military, veteran or reserves. 15 3.6 Foreign birth Born outside the U.S. 44 10.5 First generation college attendance First member of a family to attend college. 147 35.0 First generation to attend graduate college First member of a family to attend a graduate program. 93 22.0 Chronic disease/illness Person with a chronic disease or illness 38 9.0 Disability Person with documented disability 18 4.3 Rural background Resided in a rural area 45 10.7 Perception of Family socio - economic status before age 18 Low socio -economic status 90 20.1 Average socio High socio -economic status 80 18.0 Religious, spiritual or existential world view Yes 229 51.0 No 190 42.5 Member of a minority or marginalized group not mentioned Yes 24 5.4 No 414 92.6 * indicates respondent could select more than one response for the question 325 2) List the school's specific goals for increasing the representation and supporting the persistence (if applicable) and ongoing success of the specific populations defined in documentation Section 1. At MEZCOPH, we have a comprehensive list of priority underrepresented populations; the following goals and objectives are focused specifically on representation of under -represented minorities to facilitate a more inclusive and e quitable organization, and to prepare and strengthen the public health workforce. Diversity Goal 1 : Develop and Sustain a Diverse and Robust Academic Community \u00b7 Objective 1.1 that 42.5% of undergraduates will be underrepresented minorities (7.5%, 5.0% and 30% for African Americans, Native Americans and Latinx, respectively) \u00b7 Objective 1.2 that 37% of graduate students will be underrepresented minorities (5.0%, 7.0% and 25% for African Americans, Native Americans and Latinx, respectively) \u00b7 Objective 1.3 that 20% of faculty will be underrepresented minorities (3.0%, 2.0% and 15% for African Americans, Native Americans and Latinx, respectively) \u00b7 Objective 1.4 that MEZCOPH will rank as number one across ASPPH schools in the US for Native American undergraduates, g raduate students, and faculty. \u00b7 Objective 1.5 that MEZCOPH will rank as number one across ASPPH schools in the continental US for Latinx undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty. Organizational Goal 1: is to actively maintain a stable, fair and equi table organization that supports the programs, practice and policies of MEZCOPH. \u00b7 Objective 1.1 is shared governance and carried out in accordance with MEZCOPH bylaws through the establishment of the following standing committees: Faculty Assembly, Executive Council and the Committee on Inclusion and Equity (CIE). \u00b7 Objective 1.2 is the development of CIE subcommittees to support the work of the CIE in the following areas: data and evaluation, professionalism, mission and teaching, research and service. Organizational Goal 2: is to stand as a model of equity and inclusion by creating a scholarly community that understands values and respects all individuals so students, faculty and staff can achieve their full potential as public health leaders . \u00b7 Objective 2.1 is all faculty searches will have documented evidence of efforts to obtain a diverse pool of applicants. \u00b7 Objective 2.2 is to continuously review and monitor the diversity of MEZCOPH faculty, appointed and/or administrative personnel and sta ff. The Assistant Vice President for Office of Diversity and Inclusive Excellence [1] has provided consultation and resource materials to support the efforts of the CIE. Some examples include a survey template for a self-assessment of inclusion and equit y at the Department and College level, resources for the recruitment and retention of diverse faculty, and web -based and in -person trainings on unconscious bias in the hiring process. The implementation process is ongoing. MEZCOPH is the recipient of the f unding through the University's Strategic Priorities Faculty Initiative (SPFI), designed to support academic departments to strategically identify and hire faculty and/or their partners/spouses. This support has resulted in the hiring of five faculty membe rs and supports Diversity Goal 1 . Recent initiatives such as the University of Arizona Health Sciences' Strategic Plan, the new office of Inclusion and Multicultural Engagement (IME), and the recent designation of The University of Arizona as a Hispanic S erving Institution (HSI) serve as indicators for the magnitude and urgency with which leadership is concerned with the importance and demonstrates the willingness to move the needle towards a more diverse and inclusive institution. The CIE employs these in itiatives and uses them as gained momentum within MEZCOPH to strategically influence, encourage, and provide direct guidance to those in leadership positions to adopt and implement best and evidenced -based practices to achieve our diversity goals and objec tives. It is also important to acknowledge The University of Arizona is one of only a few research - intensive public institutions to receive HSI status from the United States Department of Education. The HSI designation opens new opportunities to boost supp lemental grants and student support services, as well as additional benefits to the UA for research collaborations and partnerships. 326 3) List the actions and strategies identified to advance the goals defined in documentation request 2, and describe the proc ess used to define the actions and strategies. The process may include collection and/or analysis of school -specific data; convening stakeholder discussions and documenting their results; and other appropriate tools and strategies. Inclusive Excellence (I .E.) is a strategy, introduced by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, for transforming the UA into an institution that conceptualizes inclusiveness and excellence as one and the same. The MEZCOPH Committee on Inclusion & Equity has used the I.E. Guidebook, developed by the University of Arizona, Office of Diversity and Inclusion, to develop a long -term plan for implementing and practicing I.E. following a systematic assessment process ( ERF G 1) for more details. The IE Guidebook process consists of two steps and four phases. Step One: Organization of the Committee on Inclusion and Equity Within MEZCOPH the Committee on Inclusion and Equity began developing an action plan to address the issues within MEZCOPH. Open invitations for participation in CIE were announced college -wide. We received interest from 47 members of the college who receive notifications from the CIE listserv (coph - inclusiveex@list.arizona.edu) The attendance at our mont hly meetings averages 23% participation (n=11 [+/- 2]) with representation primarily from the Office of Student Success and Academic Affairs (to include the Assistant Dean), some faculty, staff and admin, and several students. At a minimum, the composition of the CIE includes at least one faculty representative from each of the three departments and preferably from each of the programs. The CIE has 4 subcommittees: data and evaluation, professionalism, mission, and teaching, research and service. Step Two: Utilization of the Guidebook The first phase was to conduct a detailed inventory to understand current IE efforts in key topic areas, solutions for the future, and who was responsible for them. This inventory was completed by the administration of MEZCOPH and compiled by the CIE. The topic areas included: 1) Goals and Values, 2) Leadership, 3) Human Resources, 4) Climate and Culture, 5) Organizational Dimensions, 6) History, 7) New Student Orientation, 8) Faculty and Staff Orientation, 9) Student Advising, 10) Curriculum, 11) New Projects and Initiatives, 12) Faculty Promotion and Tenure, 13) Financing and Budget, 14) Committees and Taskforces, 15) Policies, 16) Managing Conflict and Discrimination, 17) Student Recruitment, Retention, and Graduation, 18) C ommunity Engagement and Outreach, 19) Artwork, 20) Fundraising, 21) Marketing and Promotional Materials, 22) Cultural Competency Training, 23) Research and Funding, 24) Physical Structure, 25) Hispanic Serving Institution Status, 26) Philosophy, Languag e, and Terminology, and 27) Student Affairs and Services. The Inventory was utilized to assess our strengths and areas for improvement (Phase Two) and develop an Action Plan (Phase Three) to address these gaps. The completed plan was submitted to the Of fice of Diversity and Inclusion in April 2017. It is important to note MEZCOPH was the first college within the UA to successfully complete this directive. Work continued through the month of April soliciting feedback from MEZCOPH faculty, staff, and stude nts. In June 2017, we met with all groups and individuals responsible for completing action items to receive their feedback. As outlined in (ERF G1), a comprehensive list of action items and strategies were developed following this process. These included strategies in the following six content areas: 1) Structure, 2) Governance and Leadership, 3) Environment and Climate, 4) Instruction - Classroom and Co ntent, 5) Faculty and Staff, and 6) Assessment. Metrics and assessments (Phase 4) are in process to monitor progress on the goals and objectives outlined in the plan. 327 4) List the actions and strategies identified that create and maintain a culturally competent environment and describe the process used to develop them. The description addresses curricular requirements; assurance that students are exposed to faculty, staff, preceptors, guest lecturers and community agencies reflective of the diversity i n their communities; and faculty and student scholarship and/or community engagement activities. MEZCOPH's actions and strategies that delineate how we maintain a culturally competent environment is presented in Table G2 . The table identifies the priority areas for the college and its curricula. Table G 2. Actions/Strategies and Curricular Requirements G2-a. Actions and strategies identified that create and maintain a culturally competent environment and describe the process used to develop them. Priority One: Structure Actions and strategies The allocation of protected budget lines to support a diversity and inclusion leadership position, training certification, and recruitment and retention programs. The co -chairs of CIE receive 0.2 FT (split) to ensure they have sufficient time to dedicate towards ensuring that MEZCOPH has an in clusive and equitable environment. A Research Specialist (0.5 FTE) also supports CIE efforts. CIE co-chairs collaborate, with individuals and organizations within and outside of MEZCOPH to include: the Dean's Office, department heads, the Development Office, the UA Office of Inclusion and Multicultural Engagement (IME), Office of Student Success and Academic Affairs, Community Engagement, Practice and Service (CEPAS), Human Resources, and the UAHS Diversity Workgroup. These collaborations are essential to ensure that actions and strategies for inclusion and equity are infused throughout all programs, units and departments within MEZCOPH and that our efforts are aligned with the Diversity and Inclusion of the UA Health Sciences and the overall University. Development and implementation of core competency and recommended diversity and inclusion related trainings required for all college leadership, faculty, staff, and students. Diversity section included in the Annual Progress Report for all faculty. Develop ment of a diversity website for the College (https://publichealth.arizona.edu/diversity -and-inclusion) Development of a checklist to ensure a diverse hiring pool for all faculty and staff positions. 328 G2-a. Actions and strategies identified that create and maintain a culturally competent environment and describe the process used to develop them. Priority Two: Inclusive learning, instruction, and classroom environments Actions and strategies The cultivation and development of an academic environment conducive to institutional transformation and excellence through teaching and learning. Strategies to support an environment and cl imate for inclusive learning, instruction and classrooms were developed through collaboration and consensus with individuals and organizations within MEZCOPH including, the Education Committee, the Dean's Office, department heads, Office of Student Success and Academic Affairs, Committee on Inclusion and Equity, Community Engagement, Practice and Service (CEPAS), and Human Resources Require all students in MEZCOPH to take at least one diversity/social justice related course The review and assessment of course syllabi for inclusion and integration of diverse scholars and perspectives to ensure the integration of literature, research a nd perspectives from people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and non -Western scholars. Established a process for anonymous reporting of student concerns through a comment box The inclusion and/or creation of learning outcomes and competencies related to diversity and inclusion. Hosted a workshop series on Diversity in the Classroom, which targeted at least one faculty representative from each of the six programs in Tucson to act as program lead for diversity and inclusion efforts. Hosted a training on microaggress ions at the college retreat which was attended by faculty and staff. Priority Three: environment and climate Actions and strategies The cultivation and education of a college community, whereby incidence of bias, discrimination, and harassment are not tolerated. For developing these strategies collaboration, direction, and consensus with individuals and organizations within MEZCOPH included: Office of Student Success and Academic Affairs, Committee on Inclusion and Equity, Community Engagement, Practice and Service (CEPAS), Human Resources, the Office of Inclusion and Multicultural Engagement (IME), and the Title IX Office. Educate the MEZCOPH community on the bias incident reporting system and ensure participation in the mandatory discrimination and harassment training Educate the MEZCOPH community about the availability of two sexual assault advocates for the University of Arizona health Sciences Working on designs with the University for Gender inclusive restrooms Instal lation of a Lactation room Developed a system to solicit anonymous feedback on issues faced by students Developed transparent salary guidelines to ensure parity in the salary structure. 329 G-2b Curricular Requirements that address diversity by degree.

It serves as a repository for numerous resources currently housed in the cloud -based storage providing easy access and availability for stakeholders involved in the hiring process of inst ructional faculty at MEZCOPH. Included in the repository are evidenced -base checklists and recommendations for best practices in the recruitment, hiring, and retention of diverse instructional faculty. One resource in particular crafted by the CIE is the M EZCOPH Faculty Hiring Strategies Checklist as a tool that highlights seven key categories such as the search committee, recruiting applicants and evaluating the search (ERF G1). This combined with additional documents on recruitment strategies and implicit bias resources make this repository a resource for all instructional faculty search committees. The CIE involvement in Faculty hiring processes has been formalized in MEZCOPH Bylaws. By following these requirements, MEZCOPH meets Organizational Goal 2; Objective 2.1 (Section 2). Faculty and student scholarship and/or community engagement activities. MEZCOPH is situated in an academic and political environment, and it is subje ct and responsive to hierarchies that perpetuate power differences. Public Health, as a discipline, also has a history of oppression and inappropriate/unethical actions in the name of the discipline. The Community Engagement, Practice, and Service Committe e's (CEPAS) purpose is to remind MEZCOPH to keep community engagement front and center in terms of what our mission is as well as to monitor how we are doing over time. CEPAS is a platform where faculty, academic professionals, students and staff discuss i ssues related to community research teaching, and service. The following three categories illustrate participative, empowerment, and leadership community engagement initiatives ( Table G.3). Each has contributed to achieving CEPAS' objectives through the d evelopment, implementation and on -going nature of programs such as the AHEC Scholars Program, the Service Learning Institute, and the Community Engaged Scholarship and Practice Award. Guest lecturers and seminar speakers are routinely recruited from our community partners ( Table G.3). 331 Table G3.

The attainment of the diversity goals set forth in Section 2 is ambitious, they are also realistic and attainable overtime and we have made good progress towards meeting them. The diversity represented within the MEZCOPH student body could not have been acco mplished without the due diligence from the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs (OSSAA). While the CIE strives to set forth an agenda that addresses the most pressing issues of diversity & inclusion within the COPH, OSSAA's approach to student re cruitment, retention, and graduation are significant. While the CIE is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of recruitment, retention, and graduation of students, OSSAA represents the largest constituent within the committee make -up. Undergraduate Public Health Program To assess the representation and supporting persistence and ongoing success of our priority populations in our undergraduate program we examined the proportion by gender and race/ethnicity for our pre -public health major (Table G4), enrolled public health majors ( Table G5), and graduates of our public health major ( Table G6) over the last 4 years (2018 -2015). The undergraduate student class is predominantly female across all five years. Pre -health, enrollment and graduation rates all track similarly indicating limited difference in success rates when considering only binary gender ( Tables G4-G6). We have met Objective 1.1. The proportion of underrepresented minority (URM) students (for those with and without two or more races), is relatively stable over the five -year period and in 2018, 47% of our graduating undergraduate public health majors were from URM backgrounds.

The graduate student body is predominantly female across all five years. Application, admission, enrollment a nd graduation rates all track similarly indicating limited difference in success rates when considering only binary gender ( Tables G7-G10). We have not met Objective 1.2. However, we have significantly increased the proportion of underrepresented minority students who apply, are admitted, enrolled and graduated over the last 4 years and are approaching the objective. The number of underrepresented minority students who applied has increased from 19% in 2015 to 31% in 2018. Similarl y, the proportion that has graduated has increased from 22% in 2015 to 34% in 2018. By year, application, admission, enrollment and graduation rates all track similarly indicating limited difference in success rates when considering proportion of underrepr esented minority students. By sub -population we are approaching but have not reached our representation goals for Native American or Latinx students. Although not one of our key priority populations, of concern is the significant downward trend in the prop ortion of international students that apply compared to those that are admitted, that enroll and that graduate ( Tables G7-G10). The key component during the reporting period was the formal implementation, by OSSAA, of the holistic admissions process in 20 17. The holistic admissions process is specific to master and doctoral level students (undergraduate admissions is not a competitive process). Additionally, MEZCOPH employs a list of best practices: the number one best practice: \"ALL APPLICANTS are encour aged to apply. There is no weeding out prior to the application process.\" Section H4 details student recruitment and admissions. MEZCOPH CIE will continue to monitor trends to see if these changes in practice continue to support and increase in the proport ion of underrepresented minority graduate students and international students. 335 Table G7.

As presented in (ERF G1), the student diversity step tables illustrate trends from 2015/16 through 2018/19 academic years. Overall the cumulative graduation rates among the different ethnic/race groups does not differ substantially. The rates for African American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander are lower than the other groups indicating they may not be graduating a t the same rate. Faculty To assess the representation and supporting persistence and ongoing success of our priority populations among our faculty we examined the proportion by gender and race/ethnicity for our primary ( Table G.11) and non-primary instructional faculty ( ERF G 1). There is consistency across years (2015 -2018) around 60% female faculty. These gender -based trends were similar between both primary and non -primary instructional faculty. In 2018, we met Objective 1.3 for our primary instruction faculty ( Table G11). We met Objective 1.3 for years 2016 -2017 if you assume that individuals who reported mixed race status are from underrepresented backgrounds ( Table G.11). However, among the primary instructional faculty the percentage of faculty from underrepresented backgrounds is 2 -3 times greater among the career and tenure track compared to the tenured faculty (ERF G 1). However, there is great promise that our tenure d faculty will be more diverse in upcoming years, as the current pool of tenure track faculty, more than 35% who have underrepresented minority backgrounds, are promoted and granted tenure. The CIE will be tasked to monitor the diversity of the faculty and identify ways to encourage the success of our current tenure track faculty in promotion. Table G11.

To assess this, we compared the diversity of our undergraduates, graduate students and faculty to the other ASPPH schools ( Table G.12). In our analysis w e excluded schools outside of the continental US (i.e., Universidad de Puerto Rico, INSP, and NTU). We have partially met Objective 1.4. We have consistently ranked as the number one school for Native American undergraduates from 2015 -2018. While in 2015, we ranked number one for graduate students, this ranking dropped to number two the remainder of the reporting period. We hired a Native American faculty member in 2015, it is not clear why they are not included in the ASPPH data as reported by UA. The CIE has formed a Data subcommittee to focus on how data is collected and reported and its accuracy. There are currently plans to hire a faculty member whose research focuses on Indigenous Health. We have not met Objective 1.5. We have consistently ranked as the number two school for Latinx undergraduates from 2015 -2018 ( Table G12). We have steadily increas ed our ranking for Latinx graduate students, and was ranked number two for the last two years (2017 -2018). There is also concern that we have been less successful in recruiting new URM faculty than other institutions as indicated by our fall in rank for fa culty from Hispanic/ Latino faculty from 1 to 6 between 2015 -2018.

While we have not done a formal climate survey of MEZCOPH, we have data from several sources indicating the potential current climate at MEZCOPH including student exit surveys and college -specific findings from a University -wide Organizational Health survey. In the exit survey for graduating students, students were asked \" What is the degree cultural diversity is supported by COPH average score (1 -5 scale, 5=most supported?)\". Results indicated that both undergraduates and graduates rank MEZCOPH as supportive of cultural diversity; undergraduate (n = 88, 4.39/5) and graduate (n = 161, 4.34/5) ( Table G13). Comments on strengths and areas for improvement were collected. Students indicated that the top two perceived strengths within the college are diversity of the students and curriculum addressing diversity. Conversely, the nu mber one area of suggested improvement, from both graduate and undergraduate students, was curriculum addressing diversity. One specific gap identified was the need to include expand the curriculum to include LGBTQ+ health. The CIE is working within MEZCOP H and with the other Health Sciences colleges to address this issue. 339 Table G13. Student Exit Survey Results, 2014 -2016 Undergraduate n=88 (2016) Graduate n=310 (2014 -2016) Degree cultural diversity is supported by COPH average score (1 -5 scale, 5=most supported) 4.39/5 4.34/5 Key Areas of Strength Diversity of Students 94 (30.3%) Curriculum Addressing Diversity 46 (52.3%) 92 (29.7%) Events/Involvement 38 (12.3%) Diversity Valued 9 (10.2%) 35 (11.3%) AZ Cultural Identities 33 (10.6%) Service Learning 28 (9.0%) Diversity of People - Faculty/Staff 27 (8.7%) Diverse People - Students 10 (11.4%) Key Areas for Improvement Curriculum Addressing Diversity 28 (31.8%) 55 (17.7%) Diversity of People - Students 31 (10.0%) Broader Definition of Diversity 30 (9.7%) Events/Involvement 24 (7.7%) The College Environment Committee was formed in the summer of 2016 following a college -wide retreat held in May of that year. During a brainstorming session at the retreat, a number of ideas for improving the work and study environment in the college were identified. Three staff members stepped forward to conceive and organize a plan for implementing those ideas. That summer, a survey went out to all faculty, staff a nd students with three objectives: 1. Prioritize ideas from the retreat based upon the college community's perceived importance of each item, 2. Request additional items from members of the college not present at the retreat, and 3. Solicit volunteers. The newly formed committee met to review the survey results on August 5, 2016, organizing the initiatives into themes and forming work groups. As the committee work groups began chipping away at the retreat to-do list, the need to survey the college again aros e. In January of 2018 a second survey was sent to the college community with similar objectives as the first. Since the committee began, more than 40 students, staff and faculty have participated in the work groups to: Create a comprehensive new -hire too l kit to aid new hires and supervisors, Convert a storage closet into a lactation room, Facilitate the establishment of bike valet for the Health Sciences, Elevate the visibility of the college's Mission, Vision and Values statement including adding them to staff/faculty on -boarding documents, new student orientation and program applications, Organize weekly yoga sessions, Create the college's diversity and inclusion webpage, Sponsor events like a college bowling night and a Finals Survival Day, Bring train ings to the college/Health Sciences on topics such as suicide prevention, managing anxiety, active shooter, and supporting victims of sexual assault, Have a water bottle refill station installed, Improve building signage, and create student suggestion boxe s. The College Environment Committee has a fairly decentralized model. The Steering Committee meets on as-need basis. The work groups, the heart of the committee, meet according to the needs and availability of the members. Some work groups elect to ke ep themselves organized and moving forward via email and phone calls rather than in -person meetings. Representatives of the work groups come together with the Steering Committee approximately four times a semester in order to provide mutual support. 340 The College Environment Committee has also executed two surveys that solicit input on necessary infrastructure changes for the improvement of the health and well -being of all members of MEZCOPH. These surveys have included several key topics that align with m onitoring and improving inclusion and diversity within the college. An initial survey was conducted in summer 2016 to all faculty, staff and students to prioritize changes to the current infrastructure in the college. The initial 2016 survey identified the following key priorities that overlap with diversity and inclusion initiatives in the College. First to promote a welcoming environment for individuals who have families, this included ensuring access to a lactation r oom, childcare resources, and family -inclusive activities. Another priority identified was to provide access to gender neutral bathrooms within the college. During the survey process there were other key issues identified that were referred to the Committe e on Inclusion and Equity for follow -up. These included responses that emphasized the college needed to develop processes that facilitated hiring and support for underrepresented groups to join MEZCOPH as faculty and staff, and finally to ensure that there was broad -scale training for all current faculty and staff on microaggressions, implicit bias, and diversity and inclusion in the classroom. The UA participates in Harvard's Collaborative on Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) Survey. One of the main f indings from the UA wide analysis is that underrepresented minority faculty (URM) have notably lower assessments of department climate, engagement, and quality , including related items such as fit, collegiality, and shared commitment to diversity. URM faculty also had more negative assessments of departmental mentoring, retention efforts, and diversity efforts. Although the gap was smaller, female faculty also had lower assessment. We only received aggregate data for MEZCOPH due to our sm all faculty numbers, thus could not examine trends by race/ethnicity or gender. However, we were able to assess areas of strength and areas for improvement compared to the other UA colleges. Compared to other UA colleges, MEZCOPH scored higher than average on: facilities and work resources, personal and family policies, health and retirement benefits, interdisciplinary work, collaboration, tenure policies, promotion to full, trust, adaptability, and collegiality. However, compared to other UA colleges, MEZC OPH scored lower on: clarity of tenure expectations, division/departmental leadership During a college -wide retreat, an exercise was undertaken to determine how well we demonstrate the values of our college. Relevant values include diversity, equity, and fairness. In fairness individuals remarked that the promotion and tenure process was fair and equitable and encompassed individuals with different types of scholarship. Within the equity group it was noted that there is an active committee on inclusion and equity, service -learning opportunities, and opportunities for trainings. Individuals also noted the need for gender -neutral bathrooms, practice of university design in classrooms, to mandate trainings, and provide more funding for diverse student and facu lty recruitment. For diversity, individuals highlighted strengths in an active diversity committee, the institutions commitment to more inclusive hiring and admissions policies, the student social justice symposium, holistic admissions, and minority facult y hires. However, it was also noted that there was a need to incentivize trainings for all faculty and staff to improve the environment, provision of more resources for retention of students, staff, and faculty, and need for more recognition of diversity e fforts. Given MEZCOPH's commitment to diversity, cultural competency and organizational health, it has been determined that there is a need to more systematically assess the college's climate. We have developed a contract with one of UA's experts on asse ssing climate for the health sciences. The CIE and the climate expert will conduct a comprehensive climate survey in fall 2019. The process will be rigorous and transparent to maximize transparency and responsiveness. The following is a brief overview of t he process and steps. Create a climate survey taskforce: A special taskforce will be created to advise on the development and implementation of the climate survey. It is recognized as critical to have participation of representatives from all perspective s therefore at a minimum we will have representatives from Dean's council, student services, undergraduate, MPH, PhD, and MS students with representation from multiple programs, tenure track faculty, non -tenure eligible faculty, and staff members. The CIE will work closely with the Dean's Council to ensure that diverse voices are represented on the taskforce. Create a climate survey webpage: To ensure transparency of the process a webpage will be created to provide information to college members about ove rall process, current stage of the work, taskforce members, and finally the unedited final report. 341 Develop climate survey tool: The Taskforce will work collaboratively with the climate survey consultant to develop items for the climate survey tool that a re priorities for the college. These items will be included with standard validated climate survey items. Obtain IRB approval: After the survey has been drafted, materials will be submitted to the IRB for review. While internal surveys do not necessarily r equire IRB approval, this added layer will ensure that confidentiality and anonymity are protected for all participants in the survey. Execute climate survey: It is expected that the survey will be implemented in spring 2020. This will allow time for deve lopment of the taskforce and survey tool. Analysis of climate survey data: The consultant will analyze the survey data and provide initial results to the Taskforce. To ensure neutrality in the analysis, no member of the taskforce will have access to the raw data. An iterative process will be undertaken to complete the analyses whereby the taskforce can request more in depth analysis as key issues are identified. Publication of report: The unedited report will be disseminated internally to all MEZCOPH stud ents, faculty and staff. Follow -up actions: After analysis, key issues that are to be addressed will be identified and assigned to specific committees or individuals as deemed appropriate. The CIE will be the lead committee to follow -up and track progress on items that are identified during the process. 7) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area. Not Applicable 342 H1. ACADEMIC ADVISING 343 H1. Academic Advising The school provides an accessible and supportive academic advising system for students. Each student has access, from the time of enrollment, to advisors who are actively engaged and knowledgeable about the school's curricula and about specific courses and programs of study. Qualified faculty and/or staff serve as advisors in monitoring student progress and identifying and supporting those who may experience difficulty in progressing through courses or completing other degree requirements. Orientation, incl uding written guidance, is provided to all entering students. 1) Describe the school's academic advising services. If services differ by degree and/or concentration, a description should be provided for each public health degree offering. The Office of Stu dent Services and Alumni Affairs (OSSAA) is home to all advising staff and student services personnel of the campus -based programs in the College. OSSAA staff includes the Assistant Dean for Student and Alumni Affairs, the Director of Admissions, the MPH C oordinator, the MS/Doctoral and Certificate Coordinator, the Phoenix MPH Coordinator, three Undergraduate Advisors, and an Administrative Associate. It also has a coordinator for the undergraduate program. The online programs also have a director and a student support specialist for the MPH program. The online undergraduate program has full -time faculty who directs the required internship . OSSAA st aff consistently work to find effective and innovative methods to deliver advising resources to a growing number of applicants and students. Eight of the ten student services professionals in OSSAA possess public health degrees, assuring close adherence to public health tenets and a keen understanding of the workforce that our students will populate. In recognition of their outstanding efforts to support our students, their participation in the advising community of the University of Arizona and nationally, the College of Public Health Undergraduate Advising Team was awarded the 2019 University of Arizona Team Award for Excellence. Comprehensive orientations are presented to each of the program levels to provide students with effective opportunities for su ccess in the College's programs. BS Program Advising Students in the on-campus and online BS program (Pre -public health majors, public health majors and public health minors) receive their advising from four academic advisors (Advisor II level employees) as well as from the Coordinator of Undergraduate Advising. A mixed model for advising combining walk -in, online group ad vising modules with appointment -based minute advising sessions is used. Each student has an assigned advisor (split by alphabet). Most recently a process by which students can request and access individual virtual advising sessions via ZOOM was instituted. Students make an appointment, show up online for the appointment, wait in a virtual wai ting room and then are invited in by their advisors. The drop-in service is carried out by the on -call advisor. Internship advising is performed by the Lecturer/Director of Undergraduate Advising. Graduate Advising The following narrative regarding gradu ate program advising includes the terms Advisor, Faculty Mentor, and Faculty Advisor. Within the MPH Program, the term Advisor refers to the MPH Coordinator and Faculty Mentor refers to the faculty member assigned to mentor the student. Within the MS/Doct oral Programs, the term Faculty Advisor refers to the faculty member assigned initially who works with the student to craft a plan of study to the particular needs relative to the student's academic and research aspirations. MPH Program Advising The College of Public Health utilizes a centralized model for advising MPH students. Students will receive advising regarding their plan of study, course sequencing of core and required courses, internship forms and process, and general programmatic polici es and procedures from the MPH coordinators and student services professionals in the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs. When admitted, students are assigned a Faculty Mentor by their program. Students are encouraged to meet with their Faculty Mentor 344 regularly who helps the student conceptualize and plan their internship project, discuss elective coursework, provides career mentoring and post graduate planning. MS, PhD, and DrPH Program Advising Upon admission to the program, a Faculty Advisor is appointed for each MS and doctoral student, matching initial student interest to faculty experience or expertise. During the first two semesters in the program, students are encouraged to acquaint themselves with all faculty members and their research interests. In this way, the student is able to identify faculty members appropriate for each stage of their graduate career. Additionally, the student is encouraged to schedule a meeting with the Program Director to discuss which faculty member would best suit their interests and needs for potential dissertation directors and committee members. In addition to the Faculty Advisor, the College employs an MS/Doctoral Coordinator, whose role it is to advise students regarding program, college, and university p olicies and procedures. Students meet with the MS/Doctoral Coordinator regularly for advice regarding all aspects of their academic progression, help with problem solving, and guidance related to accessing resources. Graduate Annual Progress Report All graduate students are required to complete an Annual Progress Report that describes their progress and accomplishments for the previous academic year. This report is completed early in the spring semester of each year. Students must review their report wit h their Faculty Mentor (MPH Program) or Faculty Advisor (MS/Doctoral Program). Program s review the reports, noting progress towards completion of required coursework, course grades, and other training experiences. When academic progress issues are identifi ed, the program faculty, in consultation with the Office Student Services, direct the student to initiate a Graduate Retention Plan in which the student must develop a strategy and timeline for addressing the identified concern. The student then is require d to seek input from their Faculty Advisor/Mentor and together, a final strategy is developed and monitored. The Graduate Retention Plan form is found in (ERF H1). 2) Explain how advisors are selected and oriented to their roles and responsibilities. (self -study document) Student services professionals in the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs are recruited employing criteria that includes prior student advising experience and/or training and work experience in the public health field. Search committees for these positions are comprised of other members of the student services team, the Assistant Dean for Student Affairs, and a student from the program which the advisor will serve. Advisor applicants have been asked to make a presentation to the Search Committee that demonstrates their ability to communicate with a group of students. Once hired, the advisor is trained in their responsibilities by current advisors and immediate supervisor. Additionally, all advising personnel are required to a) participate in training related to University of Arizona data systems and advising processes and policies, b) participate in appropriate university committees, and c) receive cross training in positions within the Office of Student Serv ices. Graduate program Faculty Advisors/Mentors are initially assigned to students by the programs during the admissions process, matching student and faculty interest and experience areas when possible. Faculty Mentors/Advisors are oriented to their rol es and responsibilities through a Faculty Handbook, meetings with the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs, the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs, Program Directors, and department meetings. Continuing educa tion, regarding issues related to instruction, is required of faculty and monitored th rough the Annual Performance Review using UAVITAE (APR) process. 3) Provide a sample of advising materials and resources, such as student handbooks and plans of study, tha t provide additional guidance to students. (electronic resource file) Handbooks, Orientation folder materials, Curriculum Guide (already appended for curriculum), the Hub (MPH Student internship/research resources, MPH Suggested Electives, MS/Doctoral R esources, Faculty Roles, Student Forms, etc.), Friday emails, Graduate College Guide to milestones and examples of undergraduate 345 advising materials can be found in the electronic resource file. Samples of these materials are located in ERF H1.1 . 4) Provide d ata reflecting the level of student satisfaction with academic advising during each of the last three years. Include survey response rates, if applicable. Schools should present data only on public health degree offerings. (self -study document) As part o f an exit survey, graduating students are asked to rate their experiences and services offered by the college. All questions are scaled 1 thru 5, 1 being poor and 5 being excellent. Not all survey respondents complete all survey questions. *Between 2016 and 2017, exit survey questions related to OSSAA advising and services were modified. Data from the last 3 years in Table H1 indicate that students rated the advising provided by the Office of Student Services to fall between good to excellent range. Table H1 .

If these differ by degree and/or concentration, provide a brief overview of each. (self -study document) BS Program Orientation All students new to the University who choose the pre -public health major are oriented to the College and the University by College of Public Health advising staff. There is a formal application to the major at which time the student meets with their acade mic advisor who orients them to the major. To better address orientation needs for a large student body, beginning in fall 2019, the college added an online orientation for majors , comprised of recorded modules that cover policies and processes, best pract ices for success, 346 as well as an introduction to public health. Students are required to take and pass a quiz related to the online materials. MPH Program Orientation Students are oriented to the MPH Program using a combination approach of online module s and a one day in -person event approach. Online modules include a short course in Public Health Essentials in Action that cover s the three core functions and 10 essential services for public health, pertinent information about academic integrity, financial assistance, college policies and procedures, and the university's learning management system, D2L, are provided to students several weeks before school starts. Following their viewing of the modules, students are quizzed to de termine their understanding of what they have heard/read. On the Friday before the fall semester, students are required to attend an all -day orientation which focuses on networking and cohort building. Issues that were not universally understood from the online modules are re -presented. An ambassador group presents tips to be successful and an alumni panel acquaints students with MPH graduates who are currently in the field and provides input to students about what they should be focusing on during school. An extended lunch with concentration faculty provides an opportunity to get to know their faculty. A presentation focused on issues related to inclusive excellence, civil discourse, and social justice is also included, as are short introductions to student organizations. Reinforcement and discussion of policies and procedures presented via the online modules occurs informed by the quiz response data. MS/Doctoral Programs Orientation The MS/Doctoral students also participate in the online orientation. In a ddition, the Master of Science and doctoral students are required to attend an in person orientation the two weekdays before the beginning of the fall term. Beginning in the fpring term, current MS and doctoral students work with the Graduate Program Coord inator to review student and faculty evaluations from the previous year to plan changes and new innovations. Whereas the focus of the online orientation is to provide essential, general information and expose students to college and campus resources, the in-person orientation is focused on relationship building with faculty, cohort building, practical information for the first year and the importance of self -care. Students evaluate each section of the orientation as it proceeds, providing important information for the following year's orientation. All in -person graduate students (MPH, MS and doctoral) convene Friday afternoon of the second day for presentations related to social justice and civil discourse, as well as presentations by representatives of student orga nizations. Following Friday orientation activities, a New Student reception is held for graduate students and faculty. 6) If applicable, assess strengths and weaknesses related to this criterion and plans for improvement in this area.

Each student, including those who may be currently employed, has access to qualified faculty and/or staff who are actively engaged, knowledgeable about the workforce and s ensitive to his or her professional development needs and can provide appropriate career placement advice. Career advising services may take a variety of forms, including but not limited to individualized consultations, resume workshops, mock interviews, c areer fairs, professional panels, networking events, employer presentations and online job databases. The school provides such resources for both currently enrolled students and alumni. The school may accomplish this through a variety of formal or inform al mechanisms including connecting graduates with professional associations, making faculty and other alumni available for networking and advice, etc. 1) Describe the school or program's career advising and services. If services differ by degree and/or conce ntration, a brief description should be provided for each. Include an explanation of efforts to tailor services to meet students' specific needs. Schools should present data only on public health degree offerings. (self -study document) Career services for College, regardless of program, are provided to students by the UA Student Engagement and Career Development Center, through the College of Public Health Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs, and via faculty mentoring. All MPH Program faculty mem bers are available to provide career advising through their individual expertise, current knowledge of opportunities in public health careers, and connections with public health practitioners. Graduate students are assigned a faculty member whose experien ce and expertise closely aligns with the student's career goals. Faculty mentors serve as a resource for students through connection and networking with professionals in their area of interest. The faculty mentor monitor the progress of the student annuall y by reviewing the progress report with the student and as such he/she is able to identify any needed area(s) of improvement and can make the appropriate recommendation(s) for improvement University career resources include large career fairs, employer inf o sessions, resume workshops and an online job board and interviewing system, called Handshake. The College hosts alumni panels, provides resume/cover letter workshops tailored for public health students, hosts a public health jobs listserv on which alums and college partners advertise positions and through which timely career guidance is provided, and most recently began offering annual career/internship fairs. Within the undergraduate program , the internship course offers students the opportunity to watc h a \"What's Next\" module/video which focuses on transferable skills and job searching tips. 2) Explain how individuals providing career advising are selected and oriented to their roles and responsibilities. (self -study document) Within the Office of Student Services, career advising and provision of resources has been principally carried out by the Assistant Dean of Student and Alumni Affairs, with assistance from the Phoenix Coordinator and the Academic Advisor/Engagement Coordin ator. The Assistant Dean has had 25 years of experience advising public health students, participating in career services training at the national level, regional and local levels. Prior to being hired by the College the Public Health, the other OSSAA memb ers, who are alumni of the College, had established careers in public health. It is their experience in public health that made them appropriate for selection to these tasks. Beginning in late spring 2019, a 0.5 FTE portion of the Engagement Coordinator's position description was redefined as providing dedicated career advising. The Assistant Dean works together with these colleagues to identify promising practices in the field, develop and deliver appropriate workshops and provide other career resources, a s needed. This team participates in the University's Career Council which offers campus career development activities, as well as other general professional development opportunities. 3) Provide three examples from the last three years of career advising se rvices provided to students and one example of career advising provided to an alumnus/a. For each category, indicate the number of individuals participating. (self -study document) 349 OSSAA provides a variety of services to assist students to prepare for their public health careers . In addition to individual counseling it hosts a variety of workshops and job fairs. A summary of 5 activities that have been in place during the past 3 years are provided in the Table H2. Table H2 .

When the alum mentions a desired geographic area, the Assistant Dean offers to contact other alumni in the desired area to ask if they would be wil ling to help a fellow alum in the job search, provide information about possible organizations in which they should be looking, or generally provide mentoring services. MEZCOPH has an active alum ni group on LinkedIn. A lumni and receive notifications on jo bs, post - graduate training opportunities and other resources to enhance their career. Communication is two -way. Members post career questions and/or challenges and solicit advice from fellow members. The college is planning to hire an alumni relations staf f person who will be able to use our professional LinkedIn network to help alumni who seek input on a job search, networking, resume review, etc. 4) Provide data reflecting the level of student satisfaction with career advising during each of the last three years. Include survey response rates, if applicable. Schools should present data only on public health degree offerings. (self -study document) As part of an exit survey, graduating students are asked to rate the career services offered by the college. All questions are scaled 1 thru 5, 1 being poor and 5 being excellent . While student satisfaction ratings are above an acceptable or average score, steps have been taken to increase the human resources available to not only provide additional and enhanced services but to better articulate and promote these services widely, ensuring that students are aware of and are encouraged to seek these services. The ratings for these services are in Table H3 . The College is able to augment the many career services offered by the centralized UA Student Engagement and Career Development Center, tailoring and targeting them for MEZCOPH students to the public health workforce, and integrating them into coursework. The College's graduate outcomes reported to CEPH/ASPPH far exceed the national average, indicating that MEZCOPH students are successful in finding employment. By reaching out to alumni for help, the college maintains close connections to a significant pr oportion of its graduates. 350 Table H3 .

Not Applicable 351 H3. STUDENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURES 352 H3. Student Complaint Procedures The school enforces a set of policies and procedures that govern formal student complaints/grievances. Such procedures are clearly articulated and communicated to students. Depending on the nature and level of each complaint, students are encouraged to voice their concerns to school o fficials or other appropriate personnel. Designated administrators are charged with reviewing and resolving formal complaints. All complaints are processed through appropriate channels. 1) Describe the procedures by which students may communicate any for mal complaints and/or grievances to school or program officials, and about how these procedures are publicized. ( self- study document) Multiple avenues for students to bring complaints to program officials and college administration exist within MEZCOPH an d are publicized in the academic program student handbooks, through the Student Hub of the college's website, through listserv messages and through the Student Affairs Committee. Complaints concerning the following issues and the processes for reviewing a nd resolving these issues are outlined below: Course/Instructor Concerns When a concern regarding a particular course or instructor is raised by a student during a semester when the student is enrolled in a course, the student is advised that the issue must first be addressed in a conversation with the course instructor. Should the student feel that the concern was not adequately addressed or resolved, the student is instructed to make an appointment with the Assistant Dean for Student and Alumni Affairs, who is the administrator designated to hear student concerns. The Assistant Dean and the student discuss the concern and strategize possible additional approaches to handling the problem. If a determination is reached that the issue cannot be reso lved without additional intervention, the Assistant Dean may discuss the situation with the instructor or forward the concern to the depa rtment head and/or program director of the instr uctor or course, the Associate D ean of Academic Affairs, or the Dean if necessary. Should similar concerns about a course or instructor be raised by multiple students, the Assistant Dean will schedule a meeting with the Department Head to apprise them of the situation. Students are regularly reminded that the end of the sem ester Teacher Course Evaluation (TCE) process provides an avenue for written feedback regarding course and instructors. Curriculum Concerns Concerns and suggestions regarding program curriculum can be raised by various means, such as bringing the issue to the Student Affairs Committee (comprised of student representatives from each program/concentration, the Assistant Dean for Student and Alumni Affairs, and student Services Professionals) or the College's Education Committee (comprised of academic progra m directors, the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and the Assistant Dean for Student and Alumni Affairs) writing a letter to the Program Director, or outlining the concern on the TCE. The Student Affairs Committee provides an opportunity for studen ts to discuss these types of issues with a larger group of their peers, often resulting in the ability to refine the issue and get broader input on possible suggested solutions. When a curriculum concern is identified and discussed in the Student Affairs C ommittee, the issue is documented in a lette r that goes to the appropriate program d irector, who then addresses the issue in a program faculty committee meeting. Grade Appeals Grade appeals are handled through the University of Arizona Grade Appeal Policy /Process which is outlined briefly below. The full process with deadlines is found in the Electronic Resource File. Physical Space Concerns Complaints about the college's physical spaces are directed to the Assistant Dean for Financial Affairs and Physic al Resources. These complaints most recently have included building thermostat settings, after - hours building access, need for a lactation room, and lack of a water bottle filling station. 353 Miscellaneous Concerns The Assistant Dean for Student and Alumni A ffairs is the designated administrator whose role it is to hear miscellaneous student complaints and determine how these issues should be addressed. Student services professionals within OSSAA often are the first to hear student concerns. These concerns ar e discussed with the Assistant Dean, who triages the response to responsible administrators or to the full Dean's Council. Additionally, the MEZCOPH Dean promotes an open -door policy for students to meet with her about any issue. The Dean hears the complai nt and either resolves it or triages the issue to the responsible administrator for action Suggestion Boxes In addition to the in -person processes by which students are able to voice concerns, the College also provides physical, as well as online, sugges tion boxes. These suggestion boxes allow students to identify concerns anonymously if desired. The online suggestion box, found on the Student Hub of the College's website, allows the student to identify the area/type of concern which then triggers the sys tem to forward the suggestion to the appropriate administrator or office. If the student wishes to be contacted re follow -up, they must provide a name and contact info. 2) Briefly summarize the steps for how a complaint or grievance filed through official university processes progresses. Include information on all levels of review/appeal. (self -study document) The College has established multiple avenues for students to raise issues of concern and students regularly use those systems to bring matt ers to the attention of responsible administrators. The UA Grade Appeal Process, which is applicable to all levels of UA students, is summarized here. The full process noting steps and deadlines in included in the Electronic Resource File. Within the f irst five weeks after the semester in which the grade to be contested was awarded, the student must discuss the concerns with the course instructor, stating the reasons for questioning the grade. The student obtains requisite forms from Assistant Dean's of fice and reviews directions. The student attests in writing that they have informed the instructor and they intend to file a grade appeal. The student formulates a written appeal and submits it to the instructor and department head. The instructor sends a written response to the student explaining grading procedures, outlining how the grade was determined, and addressing other issues raised in the student's statement. If the instructor does not respond, or does not resolve the matter, the student readdresse s appeal to department head. The department head considers the student's written statement, the instructor's written statement, and confers with each party. The department head informs the instructor and the student in writing of their recommendation. If a grade change is recommended, the instructor may refuse to accept the recommendation. The instructor notifies the department head and the student in writing of their decision. If the department head does not act on or resolve this matter to the student's satisfaction, student is required to readdress and submit the written appeal to the dean. The dean reviews the student's appeal and takes appropriate action. If the basis of the appeal is the fundamental fairness of treatment of the student by the instruc tor, the dean convenes a five-member committee to review the case. The committee should meet with the student and the instructor together in an attempt to resolve the difference. The committee considers all aspects of the case before making its recommendat ion. The committee writes a written report with recommendations and provides copies to the student, the instructor, the department head, and the dean. The dean makes a final decision after full consideration of the committee's recommendation 3) List any formal complaints and/or student grievances submitted in the last three years. Briefly describe the general nature or content of each complaint and the current status or progress toward resolution. (self - study document) 354 Table H3. Student Grievances and Outcomes Nature of Complaint Content Progress toward Resolution Access to teaching assistantships Student does not feel it is fair policy to limit the number of teaching assistantships for master's level students Discussed in Dean's Council. Determin ed that policy may be too lenient. Use of TAs will be evaluated by Asst. Dean of Student Affairs and Assoc. Dean for Academic Affairs and Asst. Dean of Financial Affairs College statements regarding issues related to social injustice Students want the college to issue proclamations of support against unjust situations when they arise Faculty voted to include student representation on newly formed College Communication Committee which will discuss these issues Faculty -Student Interaction Students would benefit from more group interaction with the faculty in their programs and concentrations. A semester doctoral student -faculty social event has been established. Student involvement in faculty recruitments Although students are included in search committ ees as members and in recruitment processes, they often don't feel their input is wanted or solicited Dean's Council voted to require departments to establish official job descriptions for search committee members and outline specific roles that students a re expected to play in recruitment processes Convocation Inadequate # of seats - complaint to UA President's Office Tickets returned because they were not needed were redistributed to those who wanted more via a lottery system Student threat Student thr eatened another student with harm University police contacted. who attended thesis defense.

Inability to reach faculty in prompt fashion Students complain that they try unsuccessfully via email and telephone to get response s from faculty When OSSAA is notified of specific issue, faculty are informed of the complaint. Students and faculty are advised to establish good communicative relationship s with faculty early in their degree pursuit rather than waiting until deadlines, crisis. The complaint recurs periodically. Need dashboard on progress toward completion of college requirements UA Graduate College has dashboard so students receive communication regarding progress toward completion of Grad College requirements. Students have complained that College should have same. MEZCOPH Information Technology Office consulted and a plan for operationalizing will be established.

We have als o purchased names from GRE and run NPR ads. Our full Recruitment Plan is located in the ERF H4. Provide a statement of admissions policies and procedures. If these differ by degree (eg, bachelor's vs. graduate degrees), a description should be provided fo r each. 1. College holistic admissions policies (ERF H4) and procedures are designed to promote excellence in public health while meeting the mission of the College. The College seeks students of the highest caliber to promote community health and wellness in the Southwest, nationally, and globally. Application and admissions processes are managed by student services professionals within the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs. The Admissions Criteria and Deadlines are also on our website: https://publichealth.arizona.edu/graduate -students/admissions/programs . Undergraduate Program Once admitted to the University of Arizona, students may declare the pre -public health major at any time. Students newly admitted to the UA attend a pre -matriculation orientation facilitated by the public health advising team. In order to add the pre -public health major after the matriculation orientation period, students must meet the 2.5 GPA requirement, watch an information session video, and complete an information session worksheet and curriculum guide. Students submit a formal application to the public health major. Admissions for the public health major occur three ti mes per year --fall, spring, and summer \u2014and each term offers a primary, secondary, and final deadline. To be eligible for admission to the public health major, students must meet the following requirements for both the main campus and online undergraduate p rograms: University of Arizona GPA of 2.5 or higher Completion of all pre -public health prerequisite courses with a grade of C or higher. Students may have up to 5 units of prerequisites still outstanding at the time of application. Completion of the major application, including: o Application form located on the Hub o Statement of Objectives and Career Plans, inclusive of the Mission and Values Statement o Resume 357 Exhibiting appropriate behavior expected of public health students, including but not limited to strong academic integrity, respectful discourse, and professional engagement in all college, university, and community environments. Academic advisors in the Office of Student Services review all applications to the major and make admissions dec isions based on whether applicants meet the minimum admissions standards. If an applicant has unusual or questionable circumstances, the Undergraduate Sub -Committee of the Education Committee is consulted. Graduate Programs Admissions to the graduate pro grams are competitive. The target number of students admitted to each program is determined by each Program Director, in consultation with their program faculty, the Director of Admissions and the Assistant Dean for Student and Alumni Affairs. Consideratio n is given to the number of returning students, faculty workload capacity, funding available to support students at the doctoral level, capacity of student services resources, and optimal student cohort size. Applications for all graduate programs are su bmitted and reviewed through SOPHAS. However, potential international students in a University of Arizona's (UA) approved micro -campus will apply to the dual degree program through the UA graduate college directly. Admissions to the on campus graduate pro grams occur for fall matriculation only, and all programs have a priority deadline (December 1/January 5) and secondary deadline (March 1) to maximize the number and quality of applications to the program. Some programs also offer a late final deadline of May 15 for the fall. Admissions for the Online MPH program occur for fall, spring, and summer with one deadline for each term. Applicants submit all materials to SOPHAS, including the following: Official transcripts from all undergraduate and graduate ins titutions attended in the U.S. and Canada WES evaluation of international transcripts Official standardized test scores, including GRE, MCAT, TOEFL, and IELTS Letters of recommendation Statement of purpose and objectives Mission and values statement R\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV Description of which courses the applicant has taken to meet our undergraduate prerequisite courses, including college level math and biology for the MPH program, and additional math/science prerequisites for Biostatistics and Environmental Healt h Sciences program Entered work and volunteer experience, as well as relevant honors/awards received Doctoral applicants are also required to submit a Research Statement that outlines their research/practice interests and the faculty members with whom they wish to work Applicants to the PhD Biostatistics, PhD Environmental Health Sciences, and DrPH programs are also required to submit a writing sample that highlights their writing and research abilities The MPH and MS programs require a prior bachelor's de gree, whereas the PhD and DrPH programs require a prior master's degree in a relevant field. The PhD Health Behavior Health Promotion program admits students directly to the PhD program, in which case they earn an MSPH degree along the way to the PhD. All admissions committees implemented a holistic admissions approach in 2017, utilizing a set of best practices around holistic admissions (located in the ERF H4). Every application is fully reviewed, and admissions decisions are based on the applicant's academic background , test scores, statement of purpose and objectives, relevant work/volunteer/internship experience, mission and values statement, resume/CV, research statement and writing sample (if applicable), and letters of recommendation. Commitment to public health, potential for success in graduate school, and availability of a faculty 358 advisor/mentor are also considered during the admissions process. Specific graduate admissions criteria are listed in greater detail at https://publichealth.arizona.edu/graduate -students/admissions/programs . Each program handles admissions decisions differently. For all MS, PhD, and DrPH programs, at least two faculty members review each application, and make a recommendation to admit, interview, or deny to the program's admissions committee. Some doctoral programs interview top applicants before an admissions decision is made. The admissions committee, led by the Progr am Director, makes the final admissions decision. In the campus -based MPH program, six programs --Biostatistics, Environmental Health Sciences, Epidemiology, Health Services Administration, One Health, and Public Health Practice --have two faculty members review each application and make a recommendation to their program's admissions committee. Three other programs \u2014Family and Child Health, Health Behavior Health Promotion, and Public Health Policy and Management \u2014ask the Office of Student Services and Alumni Affairs to conduct a first review of each application, and make a recommendation to admit, deny, or discuss. In this case, notes regarding the applicant's qualifications and any red flags are reviewed with the Program Director and/or a small committee. Fa culty members make the final admissions decisions on all applications. For the online MPH program, the faculty have given Pearson a set of admissions criteria and minimum standards. The Associate Director of Recruitment Services for Pearson reviews all a pplications. If an applicant meets the minimum qualifications and does not have any red flags, they are recommended for admission. If an applicant does not meet minimum qualifications and/or has red flags, the application is sent to the Program Director fo r an admissions decision. All applications are reviewed by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs before a recommendation to admit is submitted to the Graduate College. Official admissions for all graduate programs occur through the UA Graduate College. If recommended for admission, applicants are also required to submit a short supplemental application through the UA Graduate College. MEZCOPH admissions committees make recommendations to the Graduate College, and the Graduate College confirms that the ap plicant has a bachelor's degree (and master's degree for doctoral applicants) from a 4 -year, accredited institution with a 3.0 GPA, as well as required English proficiency exams for international applicants. The admissions GPA is calculated based on the cu mulative GPA, last 60 undergraduate credits GPA, 6 credits taken at the graduate level at the UA, or 12 credits taken at the graduate level at another institution. Occasionally, MEZCOPH recommends an applicant who does not meet the GPA requirement. MEZC OPH must write a request to waive the 3.0 GPA requirement, including compelling reasons for doing so, such as an applicant's exceptional work experience, high test scores, or strong letters of recommendation. In addition, we must write a mentoring plan in which a faculty member agrees to mentor the student and connect them with resources in order to support their success in graduate school. The Graduate College makes the final admissions decision. Select at least one of the measures that is meaningful to the school and demonstrates its success in enrolling a qualified student body. Provide a target and data from the last three years in the Format of Template H4 -1. In addition to at least one from t he list, the school may add measures. Template H4 -1.
