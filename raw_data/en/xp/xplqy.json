Campus Masking While healthy individuals are no longer required to wear masks to enter student health facilities, anyone with respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, runny nose, and/or sore throat), must still wear a mask when visiting UCSC Student Health. Because masks help protect the mask wearer and others from communicable disease exposure, SHS continues to strongly recommend their use in all healthcare facilities. [California Department of Public Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx) and [Cal/OSHA guidelines](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html) both state that individuals who test positive for COVID-19 must mask for 10 days following a positive test. Depending on community levels, mask requirements may change. Regardless of the COVID-19 community levels, [CDPH recommends](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx): - Wear a mask around others if you have respiratory symptoms - Consider wearing a mask in indoor areas of public transportation - When choosing to wear a mask, ensure your mask provides the best [fit and filtration](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Get-the-Most-out-of-Masking.aspx) - If you've had a significant exposure to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, wear a mask for 10 days.
