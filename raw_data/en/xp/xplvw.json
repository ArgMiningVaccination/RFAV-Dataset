We have 3-ply surgical masks available if you'd like one. We use medical grade air purifiers, a UV light for sanitation, and change over all laundry after each patient. Treatment chairs are spaced six feet apart with curtains in between. The treatment room has a maximum of five patients an hour, plus the acupuncturist, Sarah, for a total of six people maximum in the room at any given time. We require appointments and ask that you are on time for them. This keeps our capacity predictable and our reception area as empty as possible! What You Can Do If you are experiencing Covid-19 symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headaches and neck stiffness, or loss of tastes or smell please wait to come into the clinic until you are feeling better and/or have tested negative for Covid-19. We recommend getting both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, as well as a booster shot, and the bivalent booster! Remember that many people are still not vaccinated AND that vaccines are not 100% effective especially for immune compromised people. We are vaccinated and double booster-ed. If you have any questions about why or how you can get the vaccine for free, please ask us. What About Acupuncture? Acupuncture can treat stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia - all frequent struggles during the ongoing pandemic. Additionally, the community acupuncture setting may give you a safe space to feel connected to others in this trying time. Sarah has also accumulated a good deal of experience treating lingering Covid and long Covid. Generally, lingering Covid is if you're still having symptoms past 14 days of onset, and long Covid is if you're having consistent or recurring symptoms after 3 months, though these definitions are still shifting with time. If you're dealing with either of these, please feel free to inquire with Sarah about an ongoing treatment plan. As always, be vigilant against xenophobia, racism, classism, and any other overt or covert forms of bigotry that surround this pandemic. And remember how different things would be if we had universal healthcare. Love and care, WPCA <3 "}
