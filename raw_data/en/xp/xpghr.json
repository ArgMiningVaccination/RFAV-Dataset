Jamey Wallace, ND, MSEE Bastyr Center for Natural Health Clinic Faculty & Chief Medical Officer Dr. Wallace graduated from Bastyr University in 1996. After completing his residency, he was appointed to core clinical faculty in 1999. In 2003, he was appointed Clinic Medical Director and since has held several administrative positions including Clinic Director and now Chief Medical Officer | Executive Director of Clinical Training. He continues to teach and mentor naturopathic medical students in our Seattle teaching clinic. Prior to Bastyr, Dr. Wallace earned his bachelor's degree in anthropology, his master's degree in electrical engineering, and worked in the software industry. He has also lived and traveled in Asia and Europe and is a dedicated practitioner of tai chi, yoga, and Pilates. Dr. Wallace found his true passion and calling in naturopathic medicine. As a sixth-generation physician, he grew up in an allopathic family and has a deep respect for all that it can offer. However, as a young adult he learned first-hand the healing power of nature and the importance of supporting the body's innate healing abilities. He believes, as we teach at Bastyr, that naturopathic medicine is uniquely positioned to integrate scientific inquiry and investigation with the historic teachings and observations of our elders to optimize healing. Studying naturopathic medicine allows us to open windows and doors into all that science, nature, relationships, research and history can teach us.
