Most people who have flu are infected with the influenza type A virus. - Symptoms of Influenza A include fever and chills, sneezing, coughing and a sore throat. - As well as infecting people, the influenza A virus can infect animals, including birds and pigs. What is influenza A? Influenza A is a type of virus that causes [influenza (the flu](/flu)), a highly contagious respiratory illness. If you get it, you will need to rest at home and avoid infecting others. Vaccination can protect you against influenza A. The other types of influenza virus are type B and type C. Influenza types A and B are the most common causes of flu in Australia and can cause major outbreaks and severe disease. Influenza type C can cause an illness in children that is similar to the common cold. Most people who have flu are infected with the influenza type A virus. This virus has caused flu pandemics \u2014 the worldwide spread of a new disease. Influenza A has also caused most epidemics \u2014 the widespread occurrence of an infectious disease within a community at a particular time. Although [coronavirus (COVID-19),](/coronavirus) is a viral illness that has developed into a pandemic, the virus that causes COVID-19 is different from the one that causes influenza. Both the influenza A and influenza B viruses circulate in the community and change continually, with new strains coming out each winter. This is why yearly vaccination is recommended. What are the types of influenza A? As well as infecting people, the influenza A virus can infect animals, including birds (causing [avian flu](/avian-influenza-bird-flu)) and pigs (causing swine flu). In some cases, these types of influenza can be passed on to humans. Bird flu Avian influenza \u2014 also known as 'bird flu' \u2014 is a subtype of influenza virus A (H5N1) that mainly affects birds. The virus has caused serious infections and even deaths in humans but has not been found in Australia. Although bird flu can be severe, the number of cases found in humans has been small. Most people diagnosed with bird flu have caught it from infected birds \u2014 so far, there is no evidence that bird flu can pass from human to human. Swine flu Swine flu is a type of influenza A virus found in pigs. In 2009, a strain of flu virus known as H1N1 caused a respiratory infection in humans which spread rapidly around the world and became a pandemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the swine flu pandemic over in August 2010. The 1918 flu pandemic was also caused by an influenza A H1N1 virus. Swine flu is mild in most people but can be severe for some high risk groups such as people with chronic conditions, pregnant people and Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people.
