The most important aspect of Life Integrative Medicine is to partner with people to help them change their lives. Experience the best of medicine at Life integrative. Your choice, our promise' Life Integrative medicine new dimensions in health and healing Integrative medicine is a whole philosophy of care that is different than conventional medicine in that it incorporates a broader approach to health care. This is a model of health care that looks at the whole person, Mind body and spirit in the context of community and address all aspects of health to not only treat Integrative Medicine and Cancer Care Life Integrative Medicine in collaboration with the SimpleCare World Health offers integrative medicine services specifically designed for cancer patients, including acupuncture and massage therapy and bodywork. Integrative medicine is a healing-oriented medicine that considers the whole person\u2014body, mind, spirit and lifestyle. It uses all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative, and focuses on the needs, values and well being of the person, rather than the disease. Conventional medical care gives us options in treating a disease and its symptoms. Integrative medicine emphasizes the healing which can occur whether or not the disease is cured, giving people an ability to achieve high levels of health and healing. It expands the options for care and hope. Our integrative medicine specialists focus on how patients with cancer can become more empowered in making decisions about their health care, and take action to bring optimal healing and well-being to their life journey. Integrative medicine combines the best of conventional and alternative therapies. Integrative Medicine and Cancer Care It is important for cancer patients to receive care from a team of high quality health professionals they trust. This improves the outcome of care, decreases complications and symptoms, and lowers anxiety. Integrative medicine can help enhance immune function, which helps control tumor growth. Integrative medicine gives patients resources for: Choosing therapies that help prevent cancer or prevent a recurrence Making lifestyle changes to promote optimal health Finding evidence-based information on nutritional supplements and herbs, and background on how to avoid harmful interaction with conventional therapies or make conventional therapies less effective Decreasing the side effects of conventional therapy such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy Preparing for surgery Surviving cancer in potentially a better state of health than before cancer occurred Working through the challenges of living with cancer Making decisions with greater confidence, using inner wisdom as well as scientific information Life Integrative help patients choose the most effective therapies and assist them in using the cancer diagnosis as an opportunity for greater health, healing and growth, rather than one of hopelessness and overwhelming anxiety. The Importance of Nutrition Nutritionists recommend five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily, along with fiber, filtered water, multivitamin, calcium, magnesium and vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oil and flax seed oil for an optimal diet. Obesity increases cancer risks, as do tobacco, saturated and trans fats, processed foods, and too much alcohol. Herbs and supplements must be carefully selected for maximum benefit and to avoid harm. They are not a substitute for nutritious food. Fighting Cancer with Food and Nutrition Support immune function Rebuild body tissue Decrease your risk of infection Improve strength and increase energy Improve your tolerance to treatment Help you recuperate faster after treatment Improve quality of life Movement Can Help Prevent Cancer Even moderate amounts of exercise such as walking one hour three to five times a week can prevent cancer and decrease recurrence. Movement therapies benefit the body and can help emotional and spiritual healing. The Importance of Nutrition Social Support, Connection, Living in the Present Life Integrative Meditation and Stress Relaxation Program teaches methods to decrease stress and anxiety, savor life, and make the immune system more effective in suppressing cancer. Psychotherapy can help patients feel more empowered in coping with cancer, often leading to better decision making. Spiritual counseling also can be significant. Cancer Psychology, Social Work and Spiritual Care Services Caring for the Spirit and Energy System Acupuncture, healing touch, massage, music therapy and aromatherapy encourage the energy system to work more effectively and reduce the side effects of conventional cancer care. Guided imagery, breath work, and biofeedback also control physical and emotional symptoms, while the creativity found in writing, journaling, and artwork, helps patients access inner wisdom and facilitate healing. Each person has a unique healing path, and not all therapies will be right for all people. The oncology staff and the integrative medicine practitioners work together to address each person's unique cancer journey and strive to provide the finest comprehensive cancer care. ! LIFE - CANCER GUIDE An epidemic of cancer is silently ravaging our nation. If you yourself don't suffer from breast cancer or prostate cancer during your lifetime, someone you know or love will. The latest report by the American Cancer Society (ACS) shows that breast cancer will strike one out of every eight women. American Cancer Society, What Are The Key Statistics For Breast Cancer. http://www.cancer.org Even worse, prostate cancer will attack one out of every six men. American Cancer Society, How Many Men Get Prostate Cancer. http://www.cancer.org We've seen an almost unbelievable rise in these cancers. Consider the alarming statistics: Since 1983, rates of certain forms of breast cancer have soared 328 percent! Ernster VL, Barclay J, Kerlikowske K, Grady D, Henderson And rates of prostate cancer are much, much worse: Since 1985, they've skyrocketed 600 percent, with experts calling it \"the fastest rise in cancer detection ever recorded.\" That means, statistically speaking, either you or someone very close to you will get this disease. What's ironic is that cancer is fairly easy to prevent, and in its early stages it's easy to treat successfully. LIFE - CANCER GUIDE Cancer really doesn't deserve its horrible reputation! Welcome to the \"game of winning against cancer\". It's a serious game and you want the odds in your favor. Both traditional therapies and natural therapies can work together giving you the best \"odds\" at winning. What's great is you can try several different things at once. One can help the other. Most of our successes over the years were on patients who wanted to follow both pathways. Remember cancer is a \"wake up\" call but it is not a death knell. It tells you loud and clear that something is wrong with your life and lifestyle and that has now reduced your health and vitality to ruinous levels. You must listen to the message from Mother Nature and take appropriate action. ! If you heed the warnings and put matter right you will be quite safe. This is a sign your life was wildly off track and that they must do something effective to put matters right\u2014or pay the ultimate price. ! THE CAUSES OF CANCER To overcome any disease it makes sense that you first of all determine the basic \"cause\" in the first place. Don't believe that cancer is some kind of alien growth from planet Mars. It's normal body tissue that has changed and started to do something else. It's not a strange alien virus from outer space that landed in your body! Nature is not a fool and therefore if she switches on a mechanism, she has a reason for it. Cause No 1 - Weak Immune System - usually caused by a severe negative emotional shock (death in the family, divorce, family problems, financial setbacks, etc.) overworked and run down over an extended period of time, pessimistic negative thinking most of the time, lack of rest, and improper nutrition that reinforces the immune system. Ed Sopcak a cancer research in United States consulted with over 30,000 cancer patients. He concluded \"most all the cancer patients I have spoken with had a major stress in their life six months to 3 years before they were diagnosed with cancer. Cause No 2 - Toxins - such as dangerous chemicals (in the workplace, home or garden), microbes, parasites and fungus, etc. The late Dr. Hulda Clark who examined and treated thousands of cancer patients stated \"all cancer patients have both isopropyl alcohol (as found in many body care and household cleaning products) and the ! intestinal fluke (parasites, worms) in their liver\". Cause No 3 - Improper Diet - An regular consumption of fizzy (soft) drinks, chips (crisps), store bought pastries, deep fried foods (French fries, donuts), prepared meats (hot dogs, sausages, bacon, ham) fast foods, food additives, etc Cause No 4 - Oxygen Deprivation - Trans fats (margarine, refined vegetable oils) use in deep fried foods and processed foods (mayonnaise, refined vegetable oils) actually suffocate the cells when ingested depriving the body of life giving oxygen It may be a combination of all four of these \"causes\" or one in particular that a cancer patient can pinpoint as their main reason for having cancer. One thing for sure, your diet, lifestyle and state of mind are absolutely critical to prevent and/or win this battle WHY COMBINE TRADITIONAL AND HOLISTIC NATURAL THERAPIES? Modern chemical treatments for tumors are becoming quite specifically targeted and not so \"kill-'em-all\" dangerous as old-time chemo and radiotherapy. Modern substances can be created which release their deadly load only on certain chosen tissues: a sort of \"smart bomb\" for chemo. Now with 3D computer guided techniques at their disposal doctors can target just the cancer cells with radiation therapies. What you want then is to give your body every possible chance. Here are just some combinations of traditional and natural therapies working together: LIFE CANCER GUIDE 1. 3D Computer Guided Radiation LIFE INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE is linked with the best ultra modern hospitals here in Southern Spain in collaboration with SimpleCare World Health. We can refer you to a hospital that uses 3D computer guided radiation therapy that sends a very concentrated beam directly to the cancerous areas and tumors' causing very little damage to the surrounding cells. This is the latest high tech equipment that rivals the best oncology treatments anywhere in the world as a modern approach 2. Canadian Doctors Discover How to Make Cancer Cells Self Destruct Doctors in Canada have discovered a simple chemical compound that reduced cancer tumors in lab mice by approximately 70% in just 3 weeks. All you do is add it to cold water or juice once a day, its tasteless and odorless. It's a \"drug\" that has been around for a long time and you don't even need a prescription to purchase it. Used properly there are very few negative side effects How does this pharmaceutical compound work? All our cells in the body have a specific \"life cycle\" and when that time arrives they \"self destruct\" and are replaced by new healthy cells. However this programmed \"life cycle\" of each cell is somehow deactivated in cancer cells when they are damaged. This is due to such things that we have already mentioned such as a very weak immune system, high level of toxins (parasites, microbes) improper diet, prolonged stress, negative emotional trauma, etc. Once this happens these diseased cancer cells actually obtain a sort of \"immortality\" which is scary to say the least. That is why cancer is a very difficult disease and requires a comprehensive 'plan of attack' to win this battle. Fortunately this simple chemical compound turns on the \"programmed life cycle\" once again of the cancer cell, inducing apoptosis (death to the cell) so that they can like normal cells live their \"life cycle\" and then self-destruct. It will also work with chemotherapy. 3. TRICAN - \"Off the Chart Ratings\" - Potent Anti-Oxidant A recently published paper, just in April 2007, which was a review of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of concurrent use of antioxidants and chemotherapy. The research indicated that antioxidant use during chemotherapy was not found to decrease the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and in fact, was associated with increased survival time, increased tumor responses, and less toxicity. The authors concluded that \"large, well-designed studies of antioxidant supplementation concurrent with chemotherapy are warranted.\" Two independent laboratories demonstrated that TRICAN is an extremely effective antidote against health damaging free radicals. To obtain the equivalent antioxidant protection of just one daily dose of TRICAN (1 teaspoon) one would have to consume 5 glasses of orange juice, 26 teaspoons of concentrated green tea extract and mega-doses of superoxide dismutase tablets. Damaged cells are cells that have lost an electron. This leads to oxidation, accelerated aging, degeneration and disease. Therefore taking \"anti- oxidants\" has become popular in the fight against cancer and other illnesses. Dr. Denham Harmon became very famous for having \"discovered\" free radicals and how they cause damage to our health, leading to serious illnesses, including cancer. In a nutshell, this is how you could summarize his theory: The nucleus of an atom is surrounded by a cloud of electrons. These electrons surround the nucleus in pairs, but occasionally an atom loses an electron, leaving the atom with an \"unpaired\" electron. The atom is then called a \"free radical\", and it is very reactive. A \"free radical\" is an atom with an unpaired electron in the outer ring. It is lacking an electron. So now we have this molecule, which is missing an electron and is dying to get its hands on an electron to help fill its need. This free radical now goes and steals an electron from another molecule that is more willing to give one up and thus it becomes satisfied, but now the victim molecule has become a free radical! This goes on for quite some time. To slow down and eventually stop this free radical damage we use the potent anti-oxidant, TRICAN. 4. Emotional Healing with EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby, MD, MB, ChB, PhD states: \"I lost a wonderful patient who set up the local Gerson support group (Gerson Natural clinic of Mexico). She had overcome breast cancer, using the Gerson method. So when the disease came back a second time, she naturally had great faith in it and went through the program again. But this time she was a little more nervous and came to me (for traditional medical therapy) for IV infusions. It went well; we beat the disease a second time. Throughout her visits I begged her to get to work on emotional issues. Apart from my knowing they are always there, the fact that she had a recurrence was a clear signal (to me) that something was not resolved. But no; she thanked me for my help and went away, believing she was OK. Or if it recurred, she thought, there was always the Gerson method again. This was very blind but, being very keen on Gerson, she could not see the truth, which is that it had actually FAILED her. It hadn't dealt with the core issues in her life. It makes me angry when Charlotte Gerson has the effrontery to stand in front of an audience and say that emotional issues are of no consequence to a cancer patient. She is of course protecting her father's position (and also looking after her own financial empire). But this is the kind of ignorance among alternative practitioners that I deplore. The next time I saw this patient was over a year later. She came to see me short of breath. I ordered an immediate chest x-ray and, sure enough, she was riddled with lung metastasis.\" Research of the John Hopkins Hospital stated that: \"Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit.\" Three proven effective emotional healing therapies are used at our institute to \"neutralize\" past negative trauma caused by such events as financial setbacks, marriage and family problems, personal issues, angers, grief's, betrayals, and so on. ! Nearly every doctor will confirm that anxiety and stress are the primary reasons why most people get sick. That is why we have epidemic numbers of people who have serious health problems. Watch this short YouTube presentation on EFT at ! www.emofree.com Basically, the idea of EFT is that most emotional issues involve a disruption to the free flow of the subtle energies that circulate throughout the body. In short, when emotional stress occurs those subtle energies have been short-circuited. Correct this disruption and the problem reduces or disappears. This process is like an emotional version of acupuncture except that needles are not used. Instead, you stimulate certain energy meridian points by tapping on them with your fingertips. Interestingly, since our emotional stressors are often linked with our physical ailments, we often find that diseases and other symptoms fade upon proper use of this process. There are tens of thousands of psychologists and medical doctors that are currently using this exciting innovation in medical care. 5. You Are What You Eat The World Cancer Research Fund, the UK's leading independent cancer research foundation, states very plainly that 40% of cancers are diet-based. I suspect it is far higher. The Eskimos are a people that have been observed by medical teams for many decades and were found to be totally free of cancer. ! Alaska's most famous doctor Dr Preston A Price claims that, \"In his 36 years of contact with these people he had never seen a single case of malignant disease among the truly primitive Eskimos, although it frequently occurred when they were modernized\". An interesting point to note is that when an Eskimo leaves his traditional way of life and begins to rely on a western/modern diet he becomes even more cancer prone than the average American. The Indians of North America are another people who are remarkably free from cancer. The AMA went as far as conducting a special study in an effort to discover why there was little to no cancer amongst the Hopi and Navajo Indians. In 1843, a French surgeon, Stanislas Tanchou, MD, formulated a doctrine that the incidence of cancer increases in direct proportion to the \"civilization\" of a nation and its people. This theory was embraced by John Le Conte, MD (1818- 1891), first president of the University of California, and his enthusiasm led medical missionaries, ship surgeons, anthropologists and others to undertake an avid search for cancer among the Alaskan Eskimo (Inuit), northern Athapaskans of Canada and the native peoples of Labrador. The result was always the same: for 75 years, not a single case of cancer was documented among the tens of thousands of such people studied by competent medical examiners. The Harvard-trained anthropologist, Vilhjalmur Stefannson, for instance, lived for 11 years among the Eskimo and never saw a case. In later life, he wrote a book on the topic, Cancer: A Disease of Civilization? Similar stories are told about the indigenous peoples of Africa and Asia. Albert Schweitzer, MD, the famous Nobel laureate, testified: \"On my arrival in Gabon, in 1913, I was astonished to encounter no case of cancer....The absence of cancer seemed to me due to the difference in nutrition....\" Is this beginning to add up to a pattern for you? The Anti-Cancer Food Plan !! Dr. Johanna Budwig - who was one of Germany's top biochemists as well one of the best cancer researchers throughout all of Europe. Dr. Budwig claimed to have helped over 2400 people with her unique flaxseed oil and low fat Quark (cottage cheese) for all kinds of cancer ! patients over a 50-year period. Dr. Budwig found that the cancer patients' blood often contained a yellowish green ! ! substance. When she gave them her flaxseed oil and cottage cheese mixture, their blood was replaced with a healthy red pigment, hemoglobin. She also found that the tumors receded and disappeared, anemia was alleviated, and vital energy was regained in many cases To win the \"cancer game\" doesn't mean you have to live on vegetable juice and calf liver! Simply eat a sensible healthy diet including: fresh organic (if possible) vegetables and fruits, good sources of dietary protein, free range eggs, non- farm feed fish (those with fins and scales) and legumes. Natural fiber or roughage in the diet is also important for keeping the intestinal tract working smoothly as the body detoxifies itself of dead cancer cell debris. \"Whole\" foods (whole grains instead of refined) will support your body better than refined foods. Organic foods will support your body better than non-organic foods full of pesticides or other pollutants. And \"good\" fats will support your body better than bad fats. Use only \"cold-pressed\" oils. Consume cold pressed oils in your salads, in recipes, as you body needs good oils. Stevia, raw non-pasteurized honey, dates, figs, berry and fruit juices serve as sweeteners - no other sweeteners are permitted. All nuts (raw un-roasted) are fine except peanuts (due to mold issues). All seeds good, sunflower seeds are very complete and filling. Cup of black tea is accepted (coffee beans are toxic and not recommended). Any flour is permissible as long as it's 100% whole grain. Corn is generally believed by the group to be an exception because of mold/fungus and genetic manipulation. Drink only distilled water or reverse osmosis water it cleans the body better and is free of toxins. Avoid these unhealthy foods NO hydrogenated oils, NO trans-fats, (cold pressed sunflower seed oil is a better choice than olive oil) NO animal fats NO pork (pigs are the cleaners of the earth and their meat is loaded with toxins...ham, bacon, sausages, etc should be avoided) NO seafood (lobsters, clams, shrimp, all fish with a hard shell are cleaners of the sea and are loaded with toxins..) white regular pasta is eliminated, as is white bread, (Spelt pasta and bread is a better choice than wheat as many cancer patients have an intolerance to wheat, whole Rye, Oat, Multigrain bread is good. Corn is very discouraged (because of mold and genetic modification issues). Butter (allowed in very small amounts) NO ice cream or dairy products (other than the cottage cheese and some goat cheese) NO cane sugar, white sugar, molasses, maple syrup, Xylitol, preservatives, NO processed foods (NO store bought pastries), make your own with healthy ingredients NO Soy* milk or Soy products (unless fermented or used for 2 or 3 weeks at the beginning if you cannot tolerate the cottage cheese) Avoid pesticides and chemicals, even those in household products & cosmetics. Good old vinegar, as well as baking soda are excellent household cleaners (look on the Internet for more info) NO microwave, NO Teflon or aluminum cooking ware or aluminum foil, instead use enamel cooking ware, stainless steel, ceramic, cast iron, glass and corning cooking wear are fine. The Five Absolute Worst Foods Anyone Can Eat (1) Doughnuts are fried, full of sugar and white flour and most all varieties contain trans fat. Store-bought doughnuts are made up of about 35 percent to 40 percent trans fat. An average doughnut will give you about 200 to 300 calories, mostly from sugar, and few other nutrients. (2) Soda - one can of soda has about 10 teaspoons of sugar, 150 calories, 30 to 55 mg of caffeine, and is loaded with artificial food colors and sulphites. The diet varieties are also problematic as they are filled with harmful artificial sweeteners like aspartame. Studies have linked soda to osteoporosis, obesity, tooth decay and heart disease, yet the average American drinks an estimated 56 gallons of soft drinks each year. Plus, drinking all that sugar will likely suppress your appetite for healthy foods, which pave the way for nutrient deficiencies. (3) French Fries (and Nearly All Commercially Fried Foods) - potatoes are bad enough when consumed in their raw state, as their simple sugars are rapidly converted to glucose that raises insulin levels and can devastate your health. Better to eat yams and sweet potatoes. But when potatoes are cooked in trans fat at high temperatures, all sorts of interesting and very unpleasant things occur. Anything that is fried, even vegetables, has the issue of trans fat and the potent cancer-causing substance acrylamide. Foods that are fried in refined processed vegetable oils like canola, soybean, safflower, corn, and other seed and nut oils are particularly problematic. These polyunsaturated fats easily become rancid when exposed to oxygen and produce large amounts of damaging free radicals in the body. They are also very susceptible to heat-induced damage from cooking. What is not commonly known is that these oils can actually cause aging, clotting, inflammation, cancer and weight gain. Coconut oil is the very best choice of oils you use to cook with as it is not susceptible to high heat damage (4) Chips (Crisps) - most commercial chips, and this includes corn chips, potato chips, tortilla chips, you name it, are high in trans fat. Fortunately, some companies have caught on to the recent media blitz about the dangers of trans fat and have started to produce chips without trans fat. However, the high temperatures used to cook them will potentially cause the formation of carcinogenic substances like acrylamide, and this risk remains even if the trans fat is removed. (5) Fried Non-Fish Seafood - this category represents the culmination of non- healthy aspects of food. Fried shrimp, clams, oysters, lobsters, and so on have all the issues of trans fat and acrylamide mentioned above, plus an added risk of mercury. Seafood is loaded with toxic mercury and shellfish like shrimp and lobsters can be contaminated with parasites and resistant viruses that may not even be killed with high heat. These creatures, considered scavenger animals, consume foods that may be harmful for you. Eating these foods gives you a quadruple dose of toxins--trans fat, acrylamide, mercury and possibly parasites or viruses--with every bite. If you have a taste for seafood, there's an easy solution. It's best to avoid your local fish fry and eat the delicious wild red Alaskan salmon that was proven through independent lab testing to be virtually free of harmful levels of mercury and other contaminants. --Dr. Mercola, October 18 2003 ! Which Food Supplements Best Fight Cancer? People sometimes ask: \"Will vitamins and minerals save me?\" The answer is NO. It would be like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. But I am not saying you shouldn't add food supplement your diet. Just be realistic about what to expect. No amount of food supplements will replace good natural food. Dr. Budwig was more in favor of obtaining your daily vitamins and minerals in the form of food then in \"man made\" supplements. Celtic Sea salt is unrefined and natural salt, which contains some 80 minerals, all the body needs. Good supplements will protect you from the dire effects of chemo and radiation. Consume bee pollen, as well as the famous Dr. Johanna Budwig combination of flaxseed oil and cottage cheese, extracts from natural shark/fish oils and other herbal supplements Chlorella - With that in mind, one of your best defenses against cancer is to strengthen your immune system. This is where chlorella comes in. In one Japanese study, scientists placed lab mice on a chlorella regimen for ten days, and then they injected the mice with three types of cancer. According to Dr. Moss, over 70 percent of the chlorella-strengthened mice did not develop cancer, while all of the untreated mice died within 20 days. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs. Consumption of such natural food supplements as chlorella and chlorophyll (as in wheat or barley grass) along with some detoxification programs to help offset its negative side effects Vitamin D has emerged as a truly vital anti-cancer nutrient. A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 2006 showed that even small rises in vitamin D levels in the blood produced a dramatic lowering of cancer risk. For 6 years nearly 50,000 men were followed, while taking an average of 1500 IU daily. The results showed a 17% reduction in the incidence of cancer, almost 30% reduction in overall cancer mortality and a massive 45% reduction in deaths for bowel cancer. Another study in the same year, involving more than 120,000 women participating in two studies at Harvard University and Saint George's Hospital Medical School in London, showed that women with high levels of vitamin D were 50% less likely to get breast cancer; even those with moderately raised vitamin D levels had a measurable 10% lower risk. Yet another study showed that women who spent a lot of time in the sunshine - which is what creates vitamin D - had between 25% and 45% less cancers than the average woman. ! Which Food Supplements Best Fight Cancer? Iodine - Lack of iodine is now endemic in the US and the Western world. Iodine deficiency has many consequences, including thyroid troubles and cancer susceptibility. Iodine enhances oxygen metabolism and that has significant consequences. We encourage what is called \"iodine painting\". Make sure you get enough and read the book \"Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can't Live Without It\" by Dr. David Brownstein. Potassium - This is a surprise cancer need. Most doctors would assume automatically that the body has enough (if supplies go too low, the heart stops). But in fact this is far from the case. Max Gerson MD was made famous for his \"diet\" but I think his contribution to the understanding of the need for huge doses of potassium are, if anything, the major factor in the success of his program Gerson carefully researched and established that the toxins from cancer reduce potassium levels. That's made worse by the toxins from the destructive breakdown of cancer tumors, caused by chemo and radiation, which also dramatically lower potassium levels. Physiol.Chem.Phys.1978; 10(5):465-468 Shark Extracts - Like healthy tissue, tumors need a steady blood supply. By creating their own \"network\" of blood vessels, tumors develop an independent and reliable source of nutrients and ! oxygen, which \"feed\" the tumor. Without new blood vessels, tumors cannot grow beyond the size of a pea. Angiogenesis is a word that means new growth of blood supply. In fact tumors are very sneaky and secrete hormone-like substances called growth factors, especially one known as vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. This attaches to nearby cells, which triggers new blood vessels to sprout toward the tumor. These blood vessels provide the tumor with a steady blood supply and nutrients. Without VEGF, new blood vessels are unable to grow and support the tumor. Anti-angiogenic (angiogenesis: growth of new blood vessel) agents are thought to work by stopping the growth of new blood vessels. This process \"starves\" the tumors of the blood and nutrients necessary for growth. These types of treatments are called angiogenesis inhibitors. Shark Cartilage and extracts are very effective in stopping the growth of new blood vessels Detoxification is Essential Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby MD, MB ChB, PhD in his book \"Cancer Confidential\" on page 60 stated \"It's playing Russian Roulette to use after-shave, cosmetics, gels, hair-set, paints, household cleaners, solvents, herbicides, insecticides and other pesticides in the torrents that we do. Did you know that women absorb about half a kilo of cosmetics every year - through their skin? Add what is in the air to what's in our food and in the water and we have a big problem. Our liver and major de-tox systems try to keep pace with this lethal tide of chemicals but we are not winning. The immune system gets hurt too. Magnetic Restoration Therapy Two medical doctors, Dr. Kaali and Dr. Lyman, discovered, in 1990, that a small electric current could disable microbes from being able to multiply, thus rendering them harmless. It was, in fact, the greatest medical discovery in the history of medicine because virtually all diseases are caused by, or ! enhanced by, a microbe. What started out as an electro medicine treatment for AIDS / HIV, however, it has turned out to be an excellent cancer treatment because of the way it builds the immune system. The earth is a huge magnet, but experts claim that the earth's magnetic shield is declining. Some experts say the Earth has lost up to 90% or its original magnetism. Magnetic field generators have been installed in all manned spaceships after finding that bone marrow and cell production decline sharply and eventually cease, and the immune system is quickly and severely depressed without the normal magnetic field. So you can see why the experts place so much importance on magnetism. Could it be that by simply supplementing the earth's natural energy field, many discomforts and health concerns could vanish by using magnets to approximate what the earth's geometric field used to be? Well experiments in the laboratory have started to indicate a longevity factor in mice that are daily exposed to a stronger magnetic field. Passing a weak electrical current (about the strength of the current in a pace maker) through a strong magnets electrifies the blood and eliminates countless microbes from your body This allows your immune system to be supercharged to the point it will remove the remaining cancer cells. Heavy Metals are everywhere Recent study posted later in this journal shows that xenobiotic chemicals cause an exaggerated inflammatory response. The rest of science has already identified chronic inflammation as the number one cause of degenerative disease and aging. You should know that in the US there is a heavy burden of arsenic poisoning carried to humans via chickens. Roxarsone is a very common arsenic-based additive used in chicken feed, used to promote growth, kill parasites and improve the color of chicken meat. It is normally benign, but under certain conditions that can occur within live chickens or on farm land, the compound converts into more toxic forms of inorganic arsenic. ! Arsenic has been linked to bladder, lung, skin, kidney and colon cancers, and low-level exposure can lead to partial paralysis and diabetes. Even if you don't eat chicken, don't think you are safe: chicken manure is used as fertilizer on vegetable farms and this contains arsenic which then contaminates the vegetables. Arsenic is everywhere. Cadmium is also widespread: it is found in grains like wheat and leafy vegetables, which readily absorb cadmium from the soil. Cadmium may also contaminate fish. It is also a constituent of alloys, pigments, batteries and metal coatings. Cadmium is also found in cigarette fumes and fumes from vehicles. There are many other places you might meet cadmium, even without knowing it. Avoidance is very difficult, as I have explained. Even babies are being born with heavy metal poisoning in the womb. They didn't eat anything! Yet if you have cancer, or want to prevent it, you must try to get rid of these dangerous metals from your body. Once again Chlorella is a good choice for detoxification. It is one of the MOST scientifically researched supplements in human history. There are thousands of research papers on chlorella from medical institutions, scientific journals and universities. NASA has decided it will be one of the first foods grown on the space station when it is completed. There is not a single report of toxicity to humans taking chlorella, though if you have too much iron on board\u2014a disease called hemochromatosis\u2014you should know that chlorella contains lots of iron. (Many cancer patients are low on iron)\" FAR Infrared sauna chelates heavy metals - FAR Infrared Sauna sessions detoxify the body. Sweating is essential for good health but many cancer patients actually have a problem sweating. This needs to be corrected as sweating and fever are Nature's way of riding the boy of poisonous toxins. In researching the benefits of hyperthermia/fever therapy, we came across the work of Dr. William B. Coley. He was not your ordinary doctor, but more of a 'Sherlock Holmes' of cancer. In 1891, he began treating patients with a germ called Streptococcus pyogenes to induce a fever. His first patient developed a raging fever, and then the \"miracle\" occurred: the tumors of his tonsils and neck completely disappeared, and only a scar remained. This man, who could only swallow liquids and ! whisper when Coley started the treatment, made a complete recovery. (Ten years later he was still free of cancer.) ! Typical sweat produced under normal conditions and regular steam saunas contains 97% water and 3% toxins. Sweat produced from a Far Infrared sauna is found to be 80-85% water and 15-20% toxins! FAR Infrared sauna therapy gets rid of an accumulation of potentially carcinogenic heavy metals such as lead, mercury, zinc, nickel, cadmium, as well as alcohol, nicotine, sodium, sulfuric acid lead, copper, aluminum, pesticide residues, ! petroleum-based toxins, chloride, fluoride, as well as fat and cholesterol. Detoxify with massage and lymphatic drainage - A 2005 study in the International Journal of Neuroscience proved that when women diagnosed with breast cancer received three 30-minute massages a week for five weeks, they ended up less depressed, less angry, and with more energy than the control group. More importantly, dopamine levels, natural killer cells, and lymphocytes reportedly increased for the massage therapy group. For years, there's been a widespread myth that all massage was contraindicated (i.e. bad) for anybody with cancer. There's abundant evidence that exercise is effective as prevention AND treatment for a number of ! different types of cancer. This is widely accepted by mainstream medicine. When you get a massage, it effectively \"milks\" your lymphatic. By prompting blood flow up to a healthy level and increasing the rate of function, your body eliminates toxins more quickly and effectively. Keep in mind, the lymphatic system is basically another circulatory system within your body, so increasing pressure and flow enhances its function. Think of your lymphatic as a trash-disposal system for your body. Lymphatic drainage, courtesy of massage, is like emptying the trash \u2014 you push it out of your body. You can also get a good dose of lymphatic drainage through exercise. Either way, you're helping your immune system. 8. Exercise empowers the immune system Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby MD stated, \"I do believe we should all spend AT LEAST 4- 5 hours a week engaged in physical activity. Walking is the very least you should do; cycling is better; swimming or tennis is better still; workouts in the gym are not as good; neither is lengthy vigorous running, because that releases masses of free-radicals in the body. There is another surprise benefit to exercise: it releases a!\"#$%&'!of white cells into the peripheral blood. We all know that white cell activity means a busy immune system, with attitude.\" ! ! In a recent study headed by Dr. Kathleen Wolin ScD (published in the British Journal of Cancer, Feb. 10, 2009) showed what the researchers called \"robust\" evidence (that means pretty convincing) - that people who are physically active are 24% less likely to develop colon cancer. That pattern held for men and women, regardless of whether they got their activity on the job or in their spare time. The study itself was the pooling of 52 other published studies on the same theme. That means 24% is an average; some studies would have shown even greater reduction. Conditions We Treat Healing Strategies for Cancer ! Decrease the side effects of conventional cancer treatment. !

Our expert physicians, clinicians, and therapists will help you learn how stress reduction techniques\u2014emotional balancing, guided imagery, can reduce pain and anxiety, and can enhance the effects of treatment; how acupuncture can alleviate side effects of conventional treatment and of cancer itself (nausea, pain, tissue inflammation, fatigue, etc.); how massage can reduce swelling, pain, and anxiety; and much more. Clinical Conditions Treated chronic pain musculoskeletal and joint pain headache cancer (or other illness) treatment side effects, such as nausea and vomiting gastrointestinal conditions anxiety, including anxiety about medical procedures facing life-threatening diagnoses stress management phobias stress-related neurological problems fatigue depression The Evidence Extensive research demonstrates the powerful benefits of integrative medicine for cancer patients. Here is a sample: Complementary therapies, used, as adjuncts to mainstream cancer care, are supportive measures that help control side effects, enhance well being, and improve immune function. Mind-body techniques\u2014E.F.T. (Emotional Freedom Techniques), relaxation techniques, emotional balancing techniques, cognitive- behavior therapy, guided imagery\u2014can reduce anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and mood swings in cancer patients, and can enhance their coping. Acupuncture and acupressure help decrease nausea and vomiting sometimes associated with chemotherapy. Herbs and other dietary supplements may have a role in managing aspects of cancer support and prevention. For cancer patients, massage therapy has been recommended as part of a multiple-treatment approach to reduce pain and anxiety.! CONCLUSION Yes there IS always a cause.

Life Integrative Medicine is about \"treating all of you and not just your disease\" A Breakdown of Cancer Facts 1) Non Melanoma Skin Cancer Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the skin. It is the most common Gender Specific Cancer Types of cancer. It is almost always cured when it is found early and treated. So it is important to see your doctor if you have changes in your skin. 2) Lung Cancer Lung cancer causes the most cancer-related deaths among men and women. The most common risk factor is cigarette smoking, followed by exposure to secondhand smoke, radon, asbestos, air pollution and other chemicals. The five-year survival rate for localized lung cancer is 49 percent (but only 16 percent of lung cancers are diagnosed at this early stage). 3) Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men, and rates are significantly higher in African American men than in white men. The only well- established risk factors are age, ethnicity and family history. More than 90 percent of all prostate cancers are discovered in the local and regional stages. The five-year survival rate for all stages of prostate cancer combined is 99 percent, 10-year survival rate is 91 percent, and 15-year survival rate is 76 percent. 4) Breast Cancer Aside from skin cancers, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. Major risk factors include family history and age, and the earliest sign of breast cancer is typically an abnormality detected on a mammogram. The five-year survival rate for localized breast cancer is 98 percent. 5) Colon and Rectal Cancers More than 90 percent of colorectal cancers are diagnosed in people over the age of 50. Early stage cancer can be detected by screenings, as can colorectal polyps, which can then be removed before they become cancerous. The five-year survival rate for colorectal cancers is 64 percent. A Breakdown of Cancer Facts 6) Bladder Cancer Cancer that forms in tissues of the bladder (the organ that stores urine). Most bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas (cancer that begins in cells that normally make up the inner lining of the bladder). Other types include squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in thin, flat cells) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). The cells that form squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma develop in the inner lining of the bladder as a result of chronic irritation and inflammation. 7) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the immune system. The lymphatic system is found throughout the body. When you have this disease, cells in the lymphatic system either grow without control or do not die as cells normally do. 8) Melanoma A form of cancer that begins in melanocytes (cells that make the pigment melanin). It may begin in a mole (skin melanoma), but can also begin in other pigmented tissues, such as in the eye or in the intestines. 9) Kidney Cancer Cancer that forms in tissues of the kidneys. Kidney cancer includes renal cell carcinoma (cancer that forms in the lining of very small tubes in the kidney that filter the blood and remove waste products) and renal pelvis carcinoma (cancer that forms in the center of the kidney where urine collects). It also includes Wilms tumor, which is a type of kidney cancer that usually develops in children under the age of 5. 10) Leukemia Though often thought of as a childhood disease, leukemia is diagnosed 10 times more often in adults than in children. Symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, repeated infections, paleness, easy bruising, and nosebleeds. Cigarette smoking, exposure to chemicals such as benzene, and exposure to ionizing radiation are all risk factors for this disease. Leukemia can also occur as a side effect of cancer treatment. The five-year survival rate for acute myeloid leukemia is 21 percent, and 75 percent for those with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A Breakdown of Cancer Facts 11) Endometrial Cancer Endometrial cancer is the growth of abnormal cells in the lining of the uterus. The lining is called the endometrium. Endometrial cancer is also called cancer of the uterus, or uterine cancer. 12) Pancreatic Cancer Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include cigarette smoking, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, cirrhosis, and the use of smokeless tobacco. The disease usually presents no symptoms in the early stages, which is why only about 7 percent of cases are diagnosed at an early stage. Later symptoms can include jaundice, weight loss, discomfort in the abdomen and occasional high blood sugar levels. The five-year survival rate for localized pancreatic cancer is 20 percent. 13) Thyroid Cancer Cancer that forms in the thyroid gland (an organ at the base of the throat that makes hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and weight). Four main types of thyroid cancer are papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. The four types are based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope.

Naturopathic Medicine Program Naturopathic medicine aims to use the healing power of nature to maintain and restore health. Naturopathic practitioners use natural therapies (e.g., therapeutic nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, etc.) to support the whole person, with an emphasis on building health. Integrative Medicine Synopsis Integrative medicine is a distinct system of primary health care. It is an art, a science, a philosophy. It is a practice of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of illness. A central goal of integrative medicine is to use the healing power of nature to maintain and restore health. In addition, integrative medicine focuses on prevention. This is accomplished through education and promotion of lifestyle habits that create good health. Integrative clinicians are specialists in natural health care who use natural, non- toxic therapies to support the whole person and encourage the inherent self- healing process, with an emphasis on building health. Their goal is to minimize the risk of harmful effects on you, and apply the least possible force or intervention necessary to diagnose illness and restore your health. Integrative Medicine in Cancer Care The goal of naturopathic medicine is to create a healthy environment both inside and outside the body. This is especially significant for people with cancer. Naturopathic medicine takes a holistic, or whole- person, approach to cancer care. It makes use of time-tested, scientifically grounded, natural methods to strengthen the body's ability to heal itself. The goals of naturopathic medicine for people undergoing cancer treatment include: Support normal metabolism during treatment Decrease side effects of cancer treatment Boost the body's immune system Provide strategies for long term cancer prevention and health maintenance Integrative Assessment and Plan Upon your arrival your integrative clinician will stage your cancer and try to lessen the potential side effects of cancer treatment so you can feel better as you heal. In addition, he/she will monitor your supplement and vitamin intake to ensure safety from potential drug-herb and drug-nutrient interactions. Since all of your care is handled under one roof, your integrative clinician is able to consult regularly with your oncologist and the rest of your care team to monitor the progress of your treatment. Aside from personal consultations with your integrative clinician, you will have access to educational classes as well. Programs include information about vitamin and mineral supplements, natural remedies, nutritional guidance, lifestyle changes, stress management techniques and strategies for long-term prevention of recurrence.
