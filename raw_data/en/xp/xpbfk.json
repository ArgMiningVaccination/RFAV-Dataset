The frequency of its use by pediatric cancer patients in Croatia has not been previously determined. Methodology: In order to establish the frequency and detect factors affecting the use of CAM, a single-center, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted at the Children's Hospital Zagreb during a two-year period. The patients' parents and caregivers were offered an anonymous, multi-item questionnaire that collected socio-economic and clinical data, as well as details on CAM and dietary supplement practice. Results: Almost half of the participants reported CAM and more than two-thirds reported dietary supplement consumption, predominantly in the intensive phase of the treatment. Factors regarding children or parents had no effect on CAM and supplement utilization. Herbal medicine, vitamins, and minerals were among the most commonly used items. Every 10th child experienced at least one adverse event during CAM and supplement use. Conclusion: Awareness of the CAM and dietary supplement application in pediatric oncology patients needs to be raised due to the potential interactions with conventional treatment modalities. For this reason, it is extremely important to inform parents and caregivers of pediatric oncology patients about the use of CAM and dietary supplements to predict and mitigate the occurrence and intensity of the side effects. In the majority of our cases, the patient's guardians informed the healthcare professionals about the CAM and supplement implementation in their children, therefore, they were offered additional information about the possible negative impact of CAM and supplement use on standard medical care in a timely manner.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-10-13", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
