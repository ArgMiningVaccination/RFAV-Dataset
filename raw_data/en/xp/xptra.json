The truth is that the viruses and bacteria that cause illness and death still exist and can be passed on to people who are not protected by vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) recommend vaccinations from birth through adulthood to provide a lifetime of protection against many diseases and infections, such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis A, and hepatitis B. Yet most adults are not vaccinated as recommended, leaving them needlessly vulnerable to illness, long-term suffering, and even death. Why vaccination is important for adults - Vaccines are effective in preventing the suffering and costs associated with vaccine-preventable diseases, such as influenza, pneumococcal disease, HPV, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B. - Some of these illnesses do not have cures. All can cause tremendous health problems and even other diseases, including cancer. What you need to know about vaccine-preventable diseases COVID-19 is a disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, a flu, or pneumonia. It spreads through droplets that you project out of your mouth or nose when you breathe, cough, sneeze, or speak. - There are four COVID-19 vaccines approved or authorized in the United States: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, and in some situations, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen (J&J/Janssen). Vaccine recommendations are based on age, the first vaccine received, and time since last dose. - You are up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines when you have completed a COVID-19 vaccine primary series or got the most recent booster dose recommended for you by CDC. - If you recently had COVID-19 you still need to stay up to date with your vaccines, but you may consider delaying your next vaccine dose (whether a primary dose or booster) by three months from when your symptoms started or when you first received a positive test. Influenza, also called the flu, is a contagious viral infection of the nose, throat, and lungs that can cause mild to severe illness. Its severity varies from year to year, but at its worst it kills as many as 49,000 Americans every year, more than any other vaccine-preventable disease. - The influenza vaccine is recommended for everyone six months and older and must be given once yearly, from early fall to winter. Pneumococcal disease is an infection caused by a type of bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae that can invade the lungs, bloodstream, brain, and spinal cord, resulting in a number of different illnesses, including pneumonia and meningitis. - The pneumococcal vaccine is usually given once at age 65 or older (or in adults younger than 65 who smoke or have underlying medical conditions, like asthma). There are several vaccine options available so consult with your medical provider to find your best option. Human papillomavirus (HPV) refers to a group of more than 100 viruses that are usually spread through sexual contact. Over 42 million Americans are infected with HPV, with more than 13 million new infections occurring in the U.S. each year. The most serious long-term complication of HPV is cervical cancer in women and cancer in the back of the throat in men. It is also associated with other genital cancers in men and women. - The are three types of HPV vaccines available: the 9-valent Gardisil-9 vaccine, the quadrivalent vaccine. The terms 9-valent, quadrivalent, and bivalent refer to the number of strains of HPV the vaccine protects against (9, 4, or 2, respectively), but all three HPV vaccines protect against the two virus strains that cause most HPV cancers. The HPV vaccine is most effective if given at age 12 as recommended because it works best before someone becomes sexually active and is exposed to HPV. However, adults up to age 26 can still receive the vaccine. Adults ages 27 to 45 should talk to their healthcare provider about whether to get vaccinated. Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox (varicella zoster virus). Shingles pain has been shown to negatively affect a person's ability to function just like congestive heart failure, heart attack, type II diabetes, and/or depression. The pain of shingles can last long after the rash has disappeared. - Two doses of Shingrix shingles vaccine are recommended for persons 50 and older including people who have had shingles before and people who were vaccinated against chickenpox. - People who were vaccinated with the Zostavax vaccine should be revaccinated with Shingrix for best protection against shingles. Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a serious infection that causes coughing spells so severe that it can be hard to breathe. The disease can even lead to cracked ribs, pneumonia, and hospitalization. Since the 1980s, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cases of pertussis, especially among teens and babies less than five months of age. In 2010, California reported the largest outbreak in more than 50 years, with 10 infant deaths in the first 10 months of the year. Mothers are the source of nearly one-third of pertussis cases in newborn infants. - All adults should get vaccinated against pertussis by getting the tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis (Tdap) vaccine if they have not had it before and then getting a diphtheria/tetanus (Td) or Tdap booster every 10 years. Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread when someone eats contaminated food or drinks contaminated water. It can also be spread by close person-to-person contact such as sharing a household or through sexual contact with an infected person. About 15 percent of people with hepatitis A require hospitalization in the U.S. each year. - Adults who might encounter the infection, those with certain underlying medical conditions, and people traveling to other countries where hepatitis A is common should receive the vaccine. The hepatitis A vaccine is 94-100 percent effective in preventing hepatitis A. While protection begins approximately two to four weeks after the first injection, a second injection results in long-term protection. Hepatitis B is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus that can infect people of all ages. Up to 1.17 million people in the United States have long-term or \"chronic\" infection, which can lead to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. There is no specific treatment for people who have hepatitis B. - Adults ages 19 through 59 who were never vaccinated for hepatitis B should get the vaccine. Adults ages 60 and over who were never vaccinated for hepatitis B and who have certain underlying conditions may receive the vaccine but should consult their healthcare provider. The most common hepatitis B vaccine is a three-dose series given over six months, although a new vaccine, Heplisav-B, is given in two doses one month apart. A combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is also available. Tetanus, sometimes called \"lockjaw,\" is a bacterial infection that produces a toxin that affects the nervous system. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of reported cases of tetanus are fatal. - All adults who had the primary series of vaccines as children (diptheria-tetanus-pertussis [DTaP] or Tdap) should get a booster dose of tetanus-containing vaccine every 10 years. Tdap vaccine, a three-in-one combination that also includes protection against pertussis (whooping cough), should be used in place of one Td booster for adults.
