Services focus on pregnant people and their families - this is the place to go throughout pregnancy and postpartum adjustments. Such special care, attention and knowledge around parents and kids. - Kayla E. I've been seen by Dr. Kelsey on and off over the last 6 years. She helped me tremendously throughout my pregnancies and postpartum time. She also helped my two babies in the newborn stage after stressed labor. They were able to nurse and sleep so much better after her gentle adjustments! My husband also got adjusted several times. I highly recommend her for the whole family! - Diana P. Dr. Lloyd is the best!! If you're looking for a natural, holistic chiro, (also, a total wellness guru) she is it! I started seeing her regularly during my pregnancy when I had major hip pain and she helped me get my body fully prepped for our home birth. Then we brought our boy in for his first adjustment when he was less than a week old. We've both been continuing to see her regularly postpartum and it has been so great for both of us! She is so knowledgeable and eager to share her skills to help you any way she can. She truly cares about your health and wellness on a deep level, it is so rare and refreshing! Highly recommend this place "}
