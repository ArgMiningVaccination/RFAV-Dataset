This medicinal product contains 53.22 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 2.7% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake for sodium. The maximum daily dose of this product is equivalent to 21.28 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake for sodium. This product is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken into account for those on a low salt diet (e.g. in some cases of congestive heart failure and renal impairment). Potassium: This medicine contains potassium 1.01 mmol (39.43 mg) per tablet. To be taken into consideration by patients with reduced kidney function or patients on a controlled potassium diet.

This medicine contains 4.5 mg aspartame (E 951) in each tablet. Aspartame (E 951) is a source of phenylalanine. It may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly. May cause central nervous system depression in the presence of renal insufficiency and should not be used in patients with renal failure. A time-interval of 2 hours should be considered between Gaviscon intake and the administration of other medicinal products, especially tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, iron salts, thyroid hormones, chloroquine, bisphosphonates, and estramustine.

Symptoms Symptoms are likely to be minor; some abdominal discomfort may be experienced. Management In the event of overdose, symptomatic treatment should be given. Pharmacotherapeutic classification: A02BX 13. Other drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. On ingestion the tablet reacts with gastric acid to rapidly form a raft of alginic acid gel having a near-neutral pH which floats on the stomach contents effectively impeding gastro-oesophageal reflux for up to 4 hours, and protecting the oesophagus from acid, pepsin and bile. In severe cases the raft itself may be refluxed into the oesophagus in preference to the stomach contents and exert a demulcent effect. In addition in vitro evidence has shown that the raft has a secondary action and is able to entrap bile and pepsin within its structure, further protecting the oesophagus from these gastric components. The mode of action of Gaviscon Advance Tablets is physical and does not depend on absorption into the systemic circulation. No pre-clinical findings of any relevance to the prescriber have been reported.
