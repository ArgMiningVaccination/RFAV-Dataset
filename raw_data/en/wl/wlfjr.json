Scripps is prioritizing testing for three groups: - People with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19 - Higher risk individuals (e.g., health care workers, older adults and patients with compromised immune systems or chronic medical conditions) with mild symptoms - Pediatric patients who have mild COVID-19 symptoms for more than 72 hours If you do feel you need a COVID test, it is recommended that you first visit the [MyScripps](https://myscripps.org/mychart/Authentication/Login) online patient portal and answer the COVID-19 symptom checker questions. This will lead to appointment scheduling if indicated. You can also call our COVID nurse line at [888-261-8431](tel:+18882618431), but please know that wait times may exceed an hour or more due to a significant increase in call volume. [Symptom Checker](/virtual-care/symptom-checker) is a far better option for making a testing appointment than waiting on a busy phone line for assistance. Testing at Scripps is by appointment only and we are not able to accommodate walk-ins. Please do not go to the emergency departments or urgent care centers if you have only mild symptoms or are only seeking a COVID test. This only results in longer wait times and delays in providing care to those who need it most. Scripps is not testing those with no symptoms or who have concerns they may have been exposed to COVID-19. We apologize for any inconvenience and encourage you to explore testing options with the County of San Diego by calling [2-1-1](tel:211) or make an appointment online at [coronavirus-sd.com/testing](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/2019-nCoV/testing.html). For State of California testing locations and eligibility, call [888-634-1123](tel:+18886341123) from 7 am - 7 pm, Monday - Friday, or visit [lhi.care/covidtesting](https://lhi.care/covidtesting). What should I do if I believe I may have been infected with coronavirus? If you do test positive for COVID using an at-home test, you should isolate, even if you don't have symptoms. If you may have been exposed to the virus and may or may not have been infected, you should quarantine. We recommend following the [CDC guidelines for quarantine and isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html). For those who are not tested or are awaiting the results of their COVID-19 test, the CDC offers guidance on [what to do if you are sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html). When should I seek medical attention for coronavirus symptoms? If you develop any of the following symptoms of COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include*: - Fever or chills - Cough - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - Fatigue - Muscle or body aches - Headache - New loss of taste or smell - Sore throat - Congestion or runny nose - Nausea or vomiting - Diarrhea *This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning. Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the operator that you have or think you might have COVID-19. If possible, put on a face covering that covers your nose and mouth to protect other people. Can I get a prescription for one of the COVID-19 antiviral pills? The FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorizations to Pfizer's antiviral pill, Paxlovid, and to Merck's antiviral pill, molnupiravir, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. These COVID-19 treatments must be prescribed by a physician and are available at Scripps retail pharmacies. They are most effective when taken within five days after symptoms begin and the correct dose is taken for the prescribed length of time. Your physician can determine if antiviral medication is right for you or you can visit one of the [Test to Treat](https://aspr.hhs.gov/TestToTreat/Pages/default.aspx) locations to get rapid testing and find out if you are eligible for treatment.
