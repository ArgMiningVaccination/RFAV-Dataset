This upbringing introduced me at an early age to the medicinal power of a healthy diet, and a regime of hard work. My grandparents lived on a rural family farm nearby. Because my mother was a single parent who raised four children, we ate what we could afford. By a stroke of luck, my grandparents raised grass-fed cows and grew organic fruits and vegetables. They didn't do it because it was \"healthier\", they did it because that is what the Earth gave them. Despite living healthy, my family knows about mental health challenges. I was put on Lexapro in my teens. It didn't work. I've seen firsthand what anxiety and depression did to my sisters. They went through the conventional medication cycle, and mostly they struggled. My family is the reason I am drawn to medicine - both my sisters and my son! When I decided to begin a family, I made the decision that my son would thrive without mainstream medications. His health flourishes, without the use of antibiotics, antipyretics, or steroids \u2014 just a powerful immune system and the pillars of health. I began my education at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. After working at Penn's Center for Sleep and Respiratory Neurobiology, I became frustrated with conventional treatment for mental illness. I channeled this frustration into a path of learning, which brought me to discover naturopathic medicine. Natural medicines are often safer, and more effective than conventional medications. This fact led me to become a member of the inaugural class of doctors at Bastyr University California. I discovered my calling working in the student clinic at Bastyr. There, I successfully treated my first patients with long-term mental illnesses. I was flabbergasted. The idea that you can actually eliminate anxiety and depression had me hooked. Nobody talks about this. But it's possible. I decided to dig deeper with other illnesses like Bipolar and Schizophrenia. And low and behold, I found similar outcomes. It's totally possible to successfully treat these conditions! I am not only blown away by the successes I've had with patients, but I plan on changing the entire collective consciousness of the human community. I work hard to reduce or eliminate medications for my patients. Sound intriguing? [ Gimme a buzz!](/contact) I offer free 15-minute consultations where we can outline what to expect under my care.
