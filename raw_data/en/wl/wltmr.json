I am an avid essential oil user, junkie, in fact! I currently own 6 diffusers....I have purchased a handful of different brands, and this hands down is the best diffuser I own! - Briana ...pleased with how easy it is to use and clean... I have really enjoyed having the diffuser, and I especially like using it at night with the lavender oil. As a result, the quality of sleep that I get now is much better, and I feel much more rested each day. I have struggled with insomnia for a couple of years now so the use of this product has greatly benefited my health. I am also pleased with how easy it is to use and clean the diffuser. - Kimber ...I just love it! It is very elegant, works really well, I love the touch button and because of it I bought another 2 diffusers - one to my office and another to my living room. This was my first experience with oil difusers and I just love it! - R B. I plan on purchasing one or two more. I really love it. It's incredibly quiet, and the occasional water dripping sounds are so subtle and relaxing. It diffuses my oils very well. I love that the color lights are not overwhelming - the design is amazing. I love the option to have lights on or off. I plan on purchasing one or two more. - Diane would definitely recommend. Love this product! It is leaps and bounds better than my cheaper diffuser. It puts out way more vapor and scent and is still reasonably priced. Very happy with this purchase. Would definitely recommend. - kaeli e.
