If we build habits towards naturopathy, we can achieve sustainable health. The immune system is spread throughout the body and involves many types of cells, organs, proteins and tissues. This vast network of cells and tissues is constantly on the lookout for invaders and once an enemy is spotted, a complex attack is mounted. Crucially, it can distinguish our tissue from foreign tissue. Dead and faulty cells are also recognized and cleared away by the immune system. COMPONENTS OF IMMUNE SYSTEM WHITE BLOOD CELLS also known as leukocytes. They circulate in the body in blood vessels and the lymphatic vessels that parallel the veins and arteries. White blood cells are on the constant patrol and looking for pathogens. When they find the target, they begin to multiply and send signals out to other cell types to do the same. Our White Blood Cells are stored in different places in the body, which are referred to as lymphoid organs. These include: THYMUS, SPLEEN, BONE MARROW and LYMPH NODES. There are 2 main types of White Blood Cells: - Phagocytes: include neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and mast cells - Lymphocytes: begin their life in bone marrow. Some stay in the marrow and develop into B Lymphocytes (B cells) and others head to the thymus and become T Lymphocytes (T cells) Role of Phagocytes: Neutrophils engulf and destroy bacteria and pathogens. They are the most abundant type of WBCs in most people's bloodstreams. Monocytes are te largest types of WBCs often reside in tissues. About half of the body's Monocytes a stored as a reserve in the spleen. They are characterized to recognize danger and fight infection. Macropages, fond n the tissues lungs, skin and also organs like spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, its job is to locate foreign bodies and eat them. Mast Cells release granules filled with chemicals that cause inflammation, such as Hystamen. They mediate inflammatory responses such as hyper-sensitivity and allergic reactions. Role of B Lymphocytes (B cells): once a B Lymphocyte spot the antigen, they begin to secret antibodies.( Antigen is short for antibody generators). Antibodies are special proteins that lock on the specific antigen. Each B Cell makes one specific antibody. For instance, one might make an antibody against bacteria that causes pneumonia, and other might recognise the common cold virus. Role of T Lymphocytes (T cells): there are 2 types of T cells known as Helper T cells and Killer T cells. Killer T cells are useful for fighting viruses. They work by recognising small parts of the virus on the outside of infected cells and then destroying the infected cells. Everyone's immune system is different, but as a general rule, it becomes stronger during adulthood as by this time we have been exposed to more pathogens and developed more immunity. This is why teens and adults tend to get sick less often as compared to children. Once an antibody has been produced, a copy remains in the body so that if the same antigen appears again, it can be dealt more quickly. This is why some diseases such as chicken pox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives. This is called IMMUNITY. The immune system defends the body against infection. Although it works very effectively most of the time, sometimes our immune system fails and we become sick. There are many natural ways by which we can boost our immune system and prevent illness: DIET AND IMMUNITY Consuming a balanced diet and eating the recommended amount of nutrients will help maintain a normal immune function. Vitamins A, C and D and minerals including ZINC play a role in functioning of immune system. There is some evidence that deficiency in certain micro-nutrients alter immune responses. For example, Zinc deficiency(which may contribute to chronic diseases) has been demonstrated to negatively impact how the immune system responds to INFLAMMATION in older adults. VITAMIN D supplementation has been linked with alterations in the behaviour of immune system. Taking vitamin D supplements during pregnancy ( a period where immune system is in a continual flux) may modify the immune system of a new born in such a way that protects against respiratory infections and Asthma. Research suggests that VITAMIN D activated T cells that can identify and attack cancer cells and protect against Colorectal Cancer in some people. In older adults, VITAMIN D has also shown to reduce respiratory infections. FOODS AFFECTING IMMUNE RESPONSE Soluble Fibers (oatmeal, apples, city's fruits , strawberries, beans, peas, lentils, barley and rice bran) switches immune cells from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory, which helps us to heal faster from infection. Pterostilbene and Resveratol, found in blueberries and redgrapes, respectively, help raise the expert of human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) gene, which is involved in immune function. Probiotics may help counteract the adverse effects of broad spectrum antibiotics by keeping the immune system ready to respond to new infections. Fish oil, rich in DHA, has been found to enhance B cell activity, which could be promising to those with compromised immune systems. Prolonged fasting has been linked with stem cell regeneration of older and damaged immune cells. Curcumin, found in termeric, May assist the immune system with cleaning the brain of beta-amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease. High fat and high- calorie diets trigger a response from immune system similar to a bacterial infection. Research suggests that eating unhealthy food makes the body's defense more aggressively long after switching to a healthful diet, which may contribute to diseases like ARTERIOSCLEROSIS and DIABETES. EXERCISES AND IMMUNE SYSTEM Just like eating a healthy diet, regular physical activity contributes to overall good health and therefore, a healthy immune system. Exercise promotes efficient blood circulation, which keeps the cells of the immune system moving so that they can effectively do their job. Researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine found how just 20 minute session of moderate exercise can also act as anti- inflammatory.The findings have encouraging implications for chronic diseases like Arthritis, Fibromyalgia and Obesity. The brain and sympathetic nervous system,a pathway that serves to accelerate heart rate and raised blood pressure, among other things are activated during exercise to enable the body to carry out work. Hormones such as epinephrine and nor- epinephrine are released into the blood stream and trigger adrenergic receptors, which immune cells possess. The activation process during exercise produces immunological responses which include the production of many cytokines or proteins, one of which is TNF- a key regulator of local and systemic inflammation that also helps boost immune response. This study found that 1 session of about 20 minutes of moderate treadmill exercise resulted in a 5% decrease in the number of stimulated immune cells producing TNF. OTHER IMMUNE RESPONSE FACTORS. Chronic Sleep Deprivation: may lower the response of immune system and circulation of white blood cells, while adequate slow wave (or deep sleep) strengthens the immune system's memory of pathogens that have previously been encountered. Sunlight: getting outside in the sunlight energizes infection- fighting T cells that play a key part in immunity. Specifically, the blue light that is found in the sun's rays make T cells move faster, which may help them get to an infection site and respond more quickly. Reducing Stress: a recent study uncovered that anticipating a happy or a funny incident increased the levels of endorphins and other hormones that induce a state of relaxation. According to study at the University of California,scientists found that anticipating a funny video reduced levels of stress causing chemical messengers in the blood ,and increased the levels of chemicals known to reduce tension.The men watching the video had a 39% decrease in cortisol, a 38% drop in dopac and 70% drop in epinephrine, all of which are stress hormones. At the same time, endorphins level rose 27% and growth hormone levels rose to 87% respectively. Endorphins and growth hormones are known to reduce the effects of stress and benefit the immune system. Singing: in a choir for 1 hour was reported to reduce stress, improve mood and increase the levels of immune proteins in individuals with cancer and their care givers. Singing modulates mood, stress, cortisol, cytokines and neuropeptide activity in cancer patients and carers. Loneliness: has been pin pointed as one of the stressors that may affect the immune system. A research from Columbus, Ohio, links loneliness to a number of dysfunctional immune responses suggesting that being lonely has the potential to harm overall health. Researchers found that people who were more lonely showed signs of elevated Latent Herpes virus reactivation and produced more inflammation- related proteins in response to acute stress than did people who felt more socially connected. These proteins signal the presence of inflammation and chronic inflammation is linked to numerous conditions like Coronary Heart Disease, Type 2 Diabetes, Arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. It also aims to heal the root causes of an illness \u2014 not just stop the symptoms. Although many questions remain about the foundation of immune system, it is clear that consuming a healthy diet, regularly exercising, getting adequate sleep and reducing stress will go a long way to ensure that your immunity is maintained sustainably.
