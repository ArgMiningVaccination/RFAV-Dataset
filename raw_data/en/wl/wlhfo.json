Wounds, natural healing, and antibiotic overuse.", "sitename": "Vital Animal\u00ae \u00a7 The Natural Path", "date": "2013-09-01", "cleaned_text": "Are You Helping Create Superbugs? Fear the Darkness It was a dark, moonless night. The jungle sounds were eerily foreign to me, and the hair was standing up on the back of my neck. Was that a roar in the distance? Something above me, moving in the trees? The child clings to me, helplessly dependent on me to get her out of here alive. Luckily, I'm packing this bazooka. Beware, creatures of darkness, my finger is on the trigger, and the safety is off this bad boy. How much of your medical world view is shaped by fear of the unknown? Germs lurk in the murky darkness beneath view. Threats loom at each doorknob, touched before by an unseen hand, at each tree along your path, visited by an unknown set of paws. You read about \"superbugs\" and dread landing in the hospital for even a minor injury, because they live there. I submit that actions taken in fear will come back to bite you. A breeder writes, \"The pup... was put on antibiotics the day he was born because of a laceration he sustained on his leg when his mom accidentally stepped on him... Everything healed well, and after several weeks he was off of the antibiotics...he seemed to be doing great, passed his puppy exam at 8 weeks with no problems. I gave him a distemper/parvo combo vax at 9 weeks, just before he left to go with his new family. About a week and 1/2 after he left, he came down with meningitis...\" (emphasis mine) Wow. Meningitis?? Infection or inflammation in the brain and/or spinal cord? What's wrong with this picture? Could there have been a more Natural Path taken to prevent this disaster in the first place? Perhaps that bazooka of weeks of antibiotics was overkill for a laceration. Antibiotic Resistance: Superbugs Bite Mankind If any class of drugs is overused and thoughtlessly prescribed in modern medicine, it's the antibiotics. Hardly a day goes by in practice when I don't hear a history of misuse of these drugs. \"He had a high white count, so Dr. WhiteCoat gave him antibiotics.\" \"Her liver enzymes were elevated. She's on antibiotics and Denamarin.\" \"Sugar was furiously licking her foot. It got red and irritated. When Dr. WhiteCoat cultured her foot, he found bacteria and wanted to give her antibiotics.\" I'm convinced that, if I could take antibiotics away from Dr. WhiteCoat's pharmacy, his practice would fold. Well, okay, steroids and antibiotics -- that'd shut down most every conventional veterinary practice in existence. As a result of overprescribing this class of drugs for a couple of generations now, antibiotic resistant superbugs are on the loose. Fear begetting fear. Fighting Little Foes With Big Guns; Innocent Bystanders Killed Why would a laceration in a newborn pup need antibiotics? Would that pup have been a goner without them? How did anyone, man or beast, survive prior to antibiotics? Is the current crisis of superbugs we're helpless to combat related to the misuse of these drugs? Clearly it is, as my first link indicates. The latest understanding is that our bacterial flora outnumber our own cells by ten fold. They live on our skin, in our noses, mouths, and especially in our guts. A big walloping dose come from nursing mom, when we and other mammals are born. And [t](https://tiny.cc/uj6q2w)hese bacteria are good for us, when they are in balance. They are a significant part of the immune system, they aid in the utilization of food we eat, and they prevent the overgrowth of harmful bacteria. Antibiotics indiscriminately kill these beneficials right along with the purported evil germs we might fear. That may not even be there in the first place. Innate Healing vs Superbug Production Have you forgotten how many boo-boos you got over as a child? Scraped knees, finger cuts, overly scratched mosquito bites that bled? Hopefully, you just washed these and put on a bandage perhaps, and went right back out to play. That's what I did, though mercurochrome was pretty popular (ouch!) in my baby boomer growing up years as a topical germ killer. Given half a chance, wounds heal. There's an innate intelligence at work in all of us that is responsible. It's that same intelligence that keeps us healthy amid a sea of bacteria within and without us. A Natural Path Alternative If a wound befalls your pup, your cat, your child or you, what might you use to aid healing without risking wiping out the good bacteria who do so much good? Acute Homeopathics to the Rescue While oral arnica is a good first choice for any injury, ledum is a remedy well known for aiding lacerations to heal. It comes in a tube of pellets and is given orally. You'll see it in any good homeopathic remedy kit (like the custom one I'm developing for you, but that's coming in October. Sign up for [Vital Animal News](https://vitalanimal.com/subscribe/) to be alerted first). Any stores that sell homeopathic remedies will include ledum. A pellet given initially 2-3 times a day when a wound has just been discovered will both hasten healing and even prevent tetanus. As the wound closes, you'd give it less often, maybe once a day and stop when you see closure. Is that pup going to be licking that wound? You bet! Mom might, too, and there's evidence this promotes healing. If you want to do something topically, reach for calendula ointment or make your own calendula lotion from the tincture and some homemade saline. Calendula, the common marigold, has been speeding wound healing in both topical use and in homeopathic pellets taken orally for well over a hundred years. Here's how to make you own calendula lotion for wound treatment, from Dorothy Shepherd's, Homeopathy for the First Aider: - One pint of water - One \u00bd teaspoon of salt - One teaspoon of calendula tincture Mix the above when you see a wound that needs help, and dribble it on from a spoon or flush the wound a few times a day from a syringe. This was used with great success in the American Civil War for wound healing. Shepherd describes one surgeon from a large hospital, a Mr. Carleton, who \"used Calendula for all his operation cases, both for abdominal and bone surgery and published his results in a book, giving ample evidence for the efficacy of Calendula in surgery.\" Finding Your Way Out of Darkness Sure, it's dark out, and your animal needs you to protect her from disease. No small job, but my hope is you'll walk a better, more [natural path](https://vitalanimal.com/subscribe/) than that offered by the antibiotic pushers today. Don't let your fear create more superbugs that will rightfully deserve to be feared. I know many of you like colloidal silver for topical and even oral use. Another way to avoid the big guns and favor healing. Even better: give your dog's immune system a super boost (better than anything it's been measured against to date)!
