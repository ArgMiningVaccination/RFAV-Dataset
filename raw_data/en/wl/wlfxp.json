When you introduce a concern, be respectful and specific. State exactly what it is rather than say everything is terrible, speak about the one thing that you would like to see changed. The more specific you are the more likely this concern can be dealt with. 2. Don't just complain. Ask for a reasonable change. 3. Focus on one issue at a time. 4. Always consider compromise. Keeping an open mind makes it more likely that a creative solution can happen. Perhaps it will be something you may not even have thought of. 5. Make sure that you clearly understand the response to your complaint. If you aren't sure, ask the person to explain it differently until you do understand. 6. Try not to assume or predict how others will react to your concern. If you go in with a positive attitude and an open mind you have a better chance at finding a solution together . 7. Take the time to listen to your own thoughts and feelings before speaking. Stop and think before responding. This might mean saying, \"give a few minutes to think about that\". Take your time. 8. There are additional resources available to you. R efer to the CP9 Help and Advice sheet for advocates and their contact information.

Any Coworker of The Ita Wegman Association may be \"compelled\" (legally required under law, regardless of their own wishes) to appea r and testify in court. The documents requiring such appearance and testimony are called \"Summons\" or \"Subpoena.\" Alternatively, a Coworker may volunteer to appear and testify in court. One example of voluntary testimony is of an expert witness who is hired to assist the court by providing special knowledge or judgment. Another is of a person who has information about an accident, a crime, or business de aling and feels obliged to \"do the right thing.\" A Coworker of The Ita Wegman Association may be compelled to act as a witness or an expert witness to provide information considered to belong to T he Ita Wegman Association or to be confidential under the te rms of the Coworker's employment. COMPELLED WITNESS When a Coworker of The Ita Wegman Association is compelled, under the law, to testify in court, they do not have a choice about attendance or on how much they will say. They must testify according to their legal obligations and they must tell the truth. The evidence that they give may or may not be in the best interests of The Ita Wegman Association or of an Ita Wegman Association C ompanion. However, depending on the circumstances and within the law, p eople (including Ita Wegman Association Coworkers ) have a right to ask to not testify or ask to not answer some questions or parts of some questions. These rights are part of the Law of Evidence under our system of law. VOLUNTARY WITNESSES When a Coworker of The Ita Wegman Association is asked to voluntarily act as witnesses or expert witnesses in a court, their testimony may or may not be in the best interest of The Ita Wegman Association or Ita Wegman Association Companions. The Ita Wegman Association may decide to require the Coworker to not testify under those circumstances. Similarly, when a Coworker is asked to voluntarily provide information to the police or some person or organization, which is not a court, doing so may or may not be in the best interest of The Ita Wegman Association or an Ita Wegman Association C ompanion. The Ita Wegman Association may decide to not permit the Coworker to provide such info rmation again, under these circumstances it is legal to do so. RECEIPT OF A S UBPOENA 3 ECP5 Created: June 2017 Revi A Coworker of The Ita Wegman Association who receives a summons or a subpoena has a public legal duty to the court. However, when that happens, a Coworker who is requested to provide information, or requested or required to testify in court, in any matter related to or arising out of their employment or to the business or purposes of The Ita Wegman Association, must notify the Facility Manager and Business Administrator. Coworkers may not agree to act voluntarily as a witness or as an expert witness in any court proceeding which might affect, directly or indirectly, the best interests of The Ita Wegman Association Companion unless they: First notify the Facility Manager and Business Administrator in writing, of their intention; Receive their prior permission, in writing, to do so. Coworker of The Ita Wegman Association, who become aware that information has been subpoenaed or otherwise compelled from T he Ita Wegman Association as evidence in court or by the police, must inform the Facility Manager and Business Administrator immediately. Only the Facility Manager and Business Administrator may provide such information or delegate the provision thereof. If a Coworker of The Ita Wegman Association does not notify the Business Administrator of a receipt of a subpoena, disciplinary actions may follow depending on the situation and intent. SEARCH WARRANTS, INVESTIGATIONS, AND ANY OTHER LEGAL ACTION POLICY It is the aspiration of T he Ita Wegman Association as a corporate citizen to adhere to and comply with all provincial and federal laws pertaining to criminal investigations/legal actions. All Coworkers are required to assist investigators when served a se arch warrant or when participating in an investigation or other legal action and are expected to follow the procedures listed below. The Facility Manager and Business Administrator must be notified when a search warrant, investigation, or other legal action has been initiated. When investigating concerns, The Ita Wegman Association will do a risk assessment with Island Health Licensing and CLBC to ensure that while investigations are taking place, any risk to individuals is mitigated. The IWA must work with Island Health Licensing and CLBC as soon as The Ita Wegman Association has been notified of a search warrant, investigation, or any other legal action. The Coworker that has been named must abstain from their duties until a risk assessment is complete. 4 ECP5 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 ECP5 The risk assessment will indicate whether or not the Coworker is able to safely complete their duties and if there will be any changes to the role / respo nsibilities of the Coworker that has been named. The nature of the concern will determine whether the individual named will need to leave the premises for the duration of the investigation.

Note - The Ita Wegman Association reserves the right to terminate Coworker or a contractor with or without cause immediately depending on the seriousness of the situation without employing corrective action. PROCEDURE FORMS OF CORRECTIVE ACTION The seriousness of the behaviour dictates the seriousness of the response.

CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING CORRECTIVE ACTION 2 ECP12 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 ECP12 Each circumstance is considered on its own merits and discipline must be tailored to meet the circumstances of the specific situation. In determining the appropriate course of action, the following factors are considered: Seriousness - is the behaviour a nd/or situation so serious as to warrant severe corrective action up to and including termination ? Reason for behaviour - has the behaviour been triggered by some unusual, mitigating circumstances? Premeditation - was the behaviour willful and planned? Discipline history - has the Coworker or contractor had a history of disciplinary problems? Length of service - how long has the Coworker, or contractor worked for the Ita Wegman Association? CORRECTIVE ACTION PROCESS FOR COWORKERS The Executive Group will conduct an initial review and or investigation of the unacceptable behavior. The Executive Group reviews the behaviour with the Coworker to reach a consensus on the problematic nature of the behaviour and offers support in changing the behaviour. These discussions are held over an appropriate length of time and noted in supervision notes. A course of action is outlined by the Executive Group and must be adhered to by the Coworker. A timeframe for review of the incident and the Coworker subsequent conduct is determined based on the nature of the unacceptable behavior. Typically, the review time would be scheduled to occur after one month. A failure by the Coworker to correct the unacceptable behavior and/or an expressed unwillingness to follow th e established course of action will result in further corrective procedures. The Coworker must be informed of their rights and internal and external grievance policies. FOLLOW -UP REVIEW IF THE BEHAVIOR DOES NOT CHANGE FOR THE BETTER 3 ECP12 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 ECP12 FOR COWORKER The Executive Group must decide on an outcome.

The Executive Group informs the Coworker that a note describing the situation and the action taken will be placed in the personnel file of the Coworker. A timeframe for reviewing the new corrective procedures and the Coworker's subsequent conduct is determined based on the nature of the unacceptable behaviour and the Coworker's response to the initial corrective procedure. Typically, the review time would be scheduled to occur after one week. The Coworker must be informed of their rights and the grievance policy. SUSPENSION AND/OR TERMINATION FOR CO WORKERS Depending upon the seriousness of the circumstances (i.e. insubordination, intent to harm another person), T he Ita Wegman Association may initiate a suspension or termination without prior notification or without progressive corrective action having been taken. In those situations where suspension is the action considered or taken, a review meeting is conducted by the Executive Group and Core Group within five working days of the action being taken or within five working days of written notice of intent to take action.

Compassion and principles of openness, honesty and fairness will characterise how T he Ita Wegman Association deals with complaints and grievances. PROCEDURE The Ita Wegman Association is committed to the maintenance of high standards but from time to time Coworkers may wish to express concerns or dissatisfaction regarding situations, attitudes or practices they are faced with. The Ita Wegman Association recog nises that most people who make a complaint or grievance want to be: Listened to and be taken seriously, Offered a solution, Offered an apology where appropriate, Reassured that all concerned will work towards the situation not recurring. The Ita Wegman As sociation regards complaints and grievances as an important indication of the quality of human relationships, communication, support and community endeavour at the Ita Wegman Association. Periodic analysis will be undertaken regarding the number and type of complaints or grievances made. The Ita Wegman Association will also analyse how effectively complaints and grievances have been addressed. Nothing in The Ita Wegman Association complaints and grievance policy and procedure prevents a complainant from at any time reporting matters of concern about the support provided by The Ita Wegman Association to an external body, for example, the police, or advocate. It is important to differentiate between informal and formal complaints and grievances, as these will be treated differently. MINOR COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES It is expected that, for a variety of reasons, everyday queries, grumbles and minor disagreements will occur. These day -to-day complaints can very often be resolved relatively quickly and amicably by simply talking these things through at the time. Immediate resolution is sought. (Refer t o OP13 Issue Management ) Such complaints or grievances should be viewed as informal complaints and grievances and no further action is needed. 2 ECP27 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 ECP27 FORMAL COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES If a complaint or grievance is of a more serious nature and cannot be resolved informally, or if the complainant wishes to make a formal complaint or grievance from the very outset, then the complaint needs to be put in writing by the person making the complaint or grievanc e using the Formal Complaints Form (see EC P29: Formal Complaint Form) or by writing a letter describing the complaint or grievance and given to the Facility Manager or designate. Any complaint which is put in writing is a formal complaint or grievance. The Facility Manager or designate will deal with the complaint or grievance and undertake the following actions: Acknowledge the receipt of the letter of complaint or grievance should happen within 5 business days. Advise the complainant in writing of the action that will be taken to investigate and resolve the complaint or grievance. Conduct an investigation into the matters surrounding the complaint or grievance and try to find a satisfactory solution delivered in writing within a further 5 business days. Unless specifically requested otherwise, record the details of the complaint or grievance and the solution if any. Every effort is made to conduct any investigation into a complaint in a timely manner. (refer to OP26 Investigation Procedures ) If it is not possible for an immediate resolution of the complaint or grievance to be reached, the complainant will be advised that they will be notified in writing of the outcome of the investigation of the complaint or grievance within a period not exceeding 14 days. This notification will advise whether the complaint or grievance is upheld, partly upheld, or not upheld and any remedial action is to occur. The letter will also explain the right of appeal the complainant has if they are not satisfied either with the outcome of their complaint or grievance or how their complaint or grievance was handled. Note - In certain circumstances the Ita Wegman Association complaint or grievance procedure may need to be suspended, for example, if the matters raised in a complaint or grievance are such that they need to be referred to another agency such as the police to investigate. A complaint or grievance action will not result in any form of retaliation or barrier to accessing service. Furthermore, every effort will be made to ensure advocates or other assistance is made available upon request. 3 ECP27 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 ECP27 ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS OR GRIEVANCES Anonymous co mplaints or grievances, and complaints or grievances where the complainant is known but has requested anonymity, will be investigated with equal seriousness as any other complaint/grievance; however, the arrangements for reporting matters back to the compl ainant must invariably be different to those cases where the complainant has openly identified themselves. The Ita Wegman Association considers it the duty of any Coworker, or practicum student who have concerns / suspicions about the health or wellbeing o f a Companion , or ha ve witnessed abuse, or ha ve received an allegation or disclosure, to inform their Supervisor, a senior staff member or the Facility Manager immediately. RIGHT OF A PPEAL If a complainant chooses to exercise their right of appeal, any such appeal should be addressed to the Executive Group. The Executive Group will, within 14 days, advise the complainant in writing of the outcome of the complainant's appeal. The Executive Group's letter concludes The Ita Wegman Association's complaint /grievance procedure. If the complainant is not satisfied with the Execut ive Group's determination, the Executive Group will advise the complainant of their right to raise their complaint with an appropriate external body. MONITORING AND R EVIEW OF C OMPLAINTS / GRIEVANCES The Facility Manager will review all complaints/grievances received quarterly . This process will examine the number and nature of complaints/grievances made, and how complaints/grievances were handled. The purpose of the review will be to identify lessons learned and actions taken to improve the delivery of serv ices. The Facility Manager will share the result of the re view with the Executive Group.

Supervision is affected by the values and beliefs of T he Ita Wegman Association and is, therefore, an interactive process conducted with caring and respect for the individuals involved and is differentiated according to the needs of those individuals. It is the responsibility of the Supervisor to provide the opportunity for the C oworker being supervised to benefit from the s upervisory relationship. It is the responsibility of the person being supervised to take advantage of this opportunity. Both responsibilities are of equal importance. POLICY All Coworkers of T he Ita Wegman Association have the right to expect regular supervision as a support to maintaining and improving the quality of their work. In addition, supervision is conducted to ensure all Ita Wegman Association policies and procedures as well as works afe regulations are understood and followed. Supervision is based upon the principle of \"mutual determination\", where both the C oworker being supervised and the supervisor are responsible for the process and the outcome. Supervision occurs through a Hou se Coordinator, Workshop Leader , Facility Manager, Business Administrator, Executive Group, in support planning meetings, Coworker or house meetings, side-by-side sessions with the Companion supported, or one -to-one meetings between Coworker s. Dates and t imes for supervision are determined in collaboration with Coworker s facilitating the supervision. There are situations i.e. review of incident or critical incident reports etc. when a member of a leadership group (i.e. Executive Group, etc.) will determine a date and time to conduct supervision in order to meet licensing needs or to adhere to health and safety regulations. Supervision occurs during working hours and every effort is made to ensure supervision is conducted in a respectful and sensitive manne r. When an incident or critical incident report is submitted by Coworker s, a debriefing and supervision will be conducted by the appropriate person / group within 72 hours of the completed report. Supervision is conducted in this instance to review polic ies and procedures followed and to support workplace safety regulations. Within the context of providing quality supports to Companion s and their representatives , both the supervisor and the Coworker are held responsible: ECP30 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 ECP30 To decide the standards that must be met, What must occur in the area of tasks to be undertaken, The results to be expected and the goals to be achieved, and The indicators that will be acceptable as evidence of meeting the goals.

The continual upgrading of current knowledge and skills is essential to the provision of a high quality, effective program. All Supervisors and Coworkers should understand the limits within which they may make decisions in special situations and know when the decisions should be referred to their Supervisor or the Executive Group. It is expe cted that all Coworker s will participate in supervision as requested. Failure to do so may result in corrective action. In situations where disagreement or conflict is evident, the Coworker must follow the Executive Group's or designate direction. Coworker s who would like such matters reviewed can appeal supervisory decisions using the ECP27 Complaints, Grievance and Conflict Resolution Policy .

However, a family applying for a role (i.e. \"House Coordinators\") are considered as individual applicants. In cases where a family member of an existing Coworker of the Ita Wegman Association applies for a position or paid work contract with the Ita Wegman Association, the applicant's merits must be considered in direct relation to other applicants and they must not be given special treatment due to the family relationship with the current Coworker . A new Coworker will not be given a role for the purpose of specifically providing support to a relative and where a conflict of interest occurs.

Each Coworker will have the responsibility of ensuring an orderly evacuation of the site is followed and eva cuation routes remain unobstructed and well lit. No procedure for evacuation can be drafted to consider all consequences, therefore, common sense should prevail. Once an evacuation is deemed appropriate, the following procedures apply: COWORKER RESPONSIB ILITIES IN THE EVENT OF AN EVACUATION As it is not possible to predict who will be on the site at any given time, it is important that all Coworker s understand the evacuation procedures and the responsibilities that have been designated. Be prepared to assume full responsibility for whatever needs to be done in the moment as described above. The safety of every person in the site is the priority Coworkers on site will determine who is to lead in an emergency and as such will check and ensure that the site is clear and that all people are accounted for. If time permits, ensure that all filing cabinets are locked and that all confidential informatio n is secured in the filing cabinet. Stow, secure, and lock all information in appropriate file drawers, close windows in the office . Coworkers will be prepared to retrieve the Emergency Survival Kits and First -Aid Kits, flashlights, blankets, and water filters (which should be organized in the emergency survival bag) as they secure the house for which they are responsible. Close all doors and windows (do not lock) when clearing rooms. All Coworker s are to be trained for all emergencies, including the identification of all emergency supplies and equipment. Additionally, a list of all emergency supplies and equipment and their location is kept posted in the office at their site. EVACUATION EXITS Each site is to have a diagram of where to go during an evacuation. All Coworker s and Companions are to have training on this. Evacuation should occur through the nearest or primary exits, whichever route is the safest . If access to the primary exits is prevented by an emergency, proceed to the secondary exit. EP2 Created: June 2017 2 Revi ewed: February 2023 EP2 ASSEMBLY AFTER EVACUATION Each site has a designated meeting place prearranged where they are to meet after an evacuation. At Helios & Corwyn this is the parking lot. At the Big House, the Farm House & Harvest Hall this is Trillium. Do not re -enter a site until the Fire Department gives the all clear. Vehicles should not be moved unless requested to do so by the Fire Department.

One approach is to frame your questions with a statement indicating that you have experience with other people that have talked or acted in a similar manner when they were feeling suicidal. This is the reason for your concern. It is extremely important to remain calm, and to listen very carefully to the Companion . Try to stay with where the Companion is. This means talking with the Companion in a manner that shows that you are trying to understand, rather than trying to change their thinking. Often persons in a suicidal state do not feel listened to. Listen carefully in order to maintain a connection with the Companion. If you start trying to talk them out of it, your actions may encourage them to develop more sophisticated arguments for suicide. If you are uncomfortable questioning the Companion on this topic, immediately consult with a House Coordinator or Facility Manager. Here ar e some concrete questions that must be asked in order to complete a suicide assessment: LOOK FOR INTENT Are you feeling suicidal right now? Have you felt this way before? What happened that last time you felt this way? What happened after the last attempt? Did you receive help? What did you do to harm yourself? Has someone close to you completed suicide? Do you have access to the means? (Example: gun, pills, rope, plan. H ow lethal is the means?) Does your family have a history of mental illness? What is their history of loss? (Example: family, friends, pets, job). Does the person have a plan? How well thought out is this plan? If the Companion responds in a manner that le ads you to believe that they are suicidal. Call 911. DO NOT HESITATE. 2 EP12 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 EP12 SUICIDE ASSESSMENT : Companion has some suicidal thoughts Companion has no concrete plan Companion has no history of suicidal behaviour Companion has a good support network and is able and capable of accessing it Companion does not abuse alcohol or drugs No recent loss of completed suicides ENCOURAGE COMPANION TO : Reach out to a trusted adult Reach out to support network and follow up Emphasize calling a crisis centre Support going to an emergency ward if necessary Contact the family doctor/clinic Is the Companion aware of crisis resources such as After Hours, and the number for a local crisis centre for non- business hours? Ensure that they have these numbers. Identify other choices. Document all information in this Companion 's file and complete a Critical Incident Report. If the Companion is considered to be suicidal, contact the House Coordinator immediately after calling 911. Ensure that the Companion's Safety Plan and Ita Wegman Association medical procedures are followed if the Companion goes to the hospital e.g. all pertinent information goes with them to the hospital and a concrete follow -up plan is put in place. F URTHER THOUGHTS ON SUICIDE ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION A person who engages in suicide ideation or planning has lost all hope in their ability to overcome the problems in their life and feels helpless to control the events. Some aspects of self - destructive behaviour include: 1) The remembrance of painful experiences and ending the struggle 2) Some individuals experience a \"death wish\" i.e. the world would be better off without me. 3) Extensive thoughts of suicide. 4) Affect and Behaviour. This can include a lessening of affect, such as not showing any emotion. Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness seem to be key factors in suicide. 5) Individuals often show changes in grooming, eating or sleeping. 6) Motivatio n: what seems to be motivating the person to kill himself or herself? 3 EP12 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 EP12 7) What could be a factor in this motivation? What are the reasons to live? What would prevent the person from killing him or herself? What has kept them from attempting suicide so far? What are the relationships that matter in their lives? How will other people be impacted? How did they pull themselves away from these thoughts last time? 8) Gestures/Attempts: previous attempt history, previous gestures, what was said? to whom? 9) Preparations: Has the person given away (prized) possessions, told anyone, written a suicide note? 10) Plans/Means/Method: What is the degree of practicality in the plan to kill themselves? What is the plan? How would they do it? Do they have the means ? (Availability, opportunity, lethality) 11) Be aware of a sudden decrease in symptoms as the person appears calm and happier. This may occur as a result of the person's final acceptance of his or her plan. 12) Treatment: It is important to acknowledge that the person has an option, but have they explored other alternative choices? The goal is to help the person to experience a cognitive shift in thinking. In many, but not all, cases the person may not be abl e to experience this shift. At that time hospitalization is indicated in order to protect the person and stabilize them through a comprehensive medical and psychological assessment and follow -up treatment planning. REPORTING A Critical Incident Report should be completed immediately or as soon as possible for any Companion threatening, planning suicide or visiting a doctor or emergency department. All reports are to be reviewed by the Facility Manager.

Natural gas is colourless and odorless and has an odorant added that gives it a distinctive rotten egg smell. Natural gas is lighter than air, which means if it is leaked outdoors; it will rise and dissipate into the atmosphere. If natural gas is released in a confined space, such as inside your site, it will rise to the ceiling and accumulate. Given the right concentrations of natural gas and air, natural gas can ignite from sparks from electrical switches or appliances and from open flame such as matches and pilot lights. Fire or explosions can result. If the gas odor is strong, especially whe n accompanied by the sound of escaping gas, evacuate the premises IMMEDIATELY, shut off the main gas supply to your site and go to another location to call Superior Propane.

A person is considered capable of making their own health care decisions, including end- of-life health care, unless deemed incapable of making a specific health care decision by a health care provider or full decision making has been assigned by the co urt to a Committee of the Person (Personal Guardian). Advance care planning needs should always be considered when an individual develops a serious or life threatening illness or has increasing complex care needs as they get older. A discussion about the need for advance care planning can occur as part of a review of an individual's increasing health needs due to aging or illness. The Facility Manager or CLBC facilitators can assist the Companion and their family to initiate the process with a health care provider. When the individual can benefit from advanced care planning and their family cannot assist them, support is provided by Ita Wegman Association. The Ita Wegman Association may provide planning support or assistance with service coordination to families and/or individuals who are involved in end -of-life care and service planning. The Ita Wegman Association or families are usually the primary point of contact for health care providers involved in end -of-life health care. Notification Family memb ers of an individual residing at The Ita Wegman Association, who is deemed palliative by a physician, should be notified that the Companion has been deemed palliative unless the circumstances indicate that the Companion does not wish to have contact with their family. A discussion can occur with the Companion about how they would like their family to be informed.

An annual budget is set following an annual budget and program review. The Ita Wegman Association of BC's annual budget is reviewed on a monthly basis and can forecast income (based on confirmed and projected C ompanion intakes) and expenses (based on anticipated support delivery costs). The budget is used to guide and monitor current spending patterns and to assist in future financial planning for the association . POLICY The budgetary system links program functions and activitie s to the costs necessary for their support. The Business Administrator, Finance Committee, and Board of Directors establish an appropriate budget for all support and program needs. The Board of Directors approves the budget on an annual basis. The Business Administrator, and Finance Committee review the budget on a weekly basis; recommending adjustments and alterations as needed to the Board of Directors for approval. The Boar d of Directors reviews the budget on a monthly / as needed basis. PROCEDURES 1. D EVELOPING THE BUDGET The Business Administrator and Finance Committee prepare an annual budget in accordance with general accepted accounting principles (GAAP), in a format containing projected sources of income and a forecast of expenditures. Budgeting in any fiscal year or t he remaining part of any fiscal year shall not deviate materially from current policies (see financial policies), or risk financial stability . Accordingly, the Business Administrator may not cause, or allow budgeting which: contains too little information to enable credible projection of revenue and expenses; contains too little information to enable separation of capital and operational items, cash flow, and disclosure of planning assumptions; plans the expenditure in any fiscal year of more funds than are conservatively projected to be received in that period; endangers the fiscal soundness of future years; or ignores the building of organizational capability sufficient to achieve outcomes in future years. The Board of Directors examines the budget on a m onthly / as needed basis, and approves the budget on an annual basis. 2 FP9 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 FP9 2. MONITORING THE BUDGET The Business Administrator requests that the accountant prepares regular comparative statements that show actual expenditures compared to budget amounts for each forecasted expense category along with total income received and total expenses incurred (Profit and Loss Statement).

Together these comprise an overall Association Budget and would include these bank accounts which are detailed in separate policy: Operations Reserve payment account - includes funding for capital projects Restricted funds - a reserve account that contains money that can only be used for specific purposes. This policy covers the terms and concepts involved in creating and managing the capital budget which would be \"financed\" from the Reserve Payment Account. The Association's operating budget reflects the planned financial activities for a year, showing how much revenue is expected from which sources and how much it will spend on operations. A capital budget relates more to the Association's financial position: its assets, liabilities, and net assets, settin g forth goals and targets for these areas. Good financial management requires the Association to understand its capital structure and to be conscious and deliberate about setting and reaching its long -term financial goals. These goals as identified in a ca pital budget might include: Asset purchases or investments (such as new vehicle, equipment, building, or major property improvements) Financial stability targets (such as building an operating reserve, reducing debt such as a mortgage or eliminating a deficit) Strategic targets (such as building a fund to support program or management initiatives not covered in the operating budget). Capital budgets often require a funding plan separate from and in addition to the operating budget. 2 FP 18 Created: December 2021 Reviewed: February 2023 FP 18 PROCEDURES SETTING CAPITAL STRUCTURE TARGETS Building and maintaining an Operating Reserve (Reserve Payment Account) is a top priority. Operating reserves are essentially the accumulation of unrestricted surpluses that are liquid (as opposed to invested in fixed assets) and thus available for use at the discretion of the Board. The presence of an operating reserve increases the Association 's ability to take mission -related risks and to absorb or respond to temporary changes in its environment or circumstances, for example, significant unbudgeted increases in operating expenses or losses in operating revenues. SURPLUS IS KEY Nonprofits are similar to \"businesses\" whose profits (surpluses) remain with the nonprofit entity rather than going to individuals or shareholders as in a for -profit business model. Note: \"not -for-profit\" does not mean \"no surplus allowed\". The Association needs funds to function at peak efficiency, hence the need for operating reserves. Operating reserves or working capital funds create liquidity and financial flexibility for the Association. Association's with a strong working capital (calculated as the current assets minus the current liabilities) position can focus beyond day -to-day cash flow needs and more effectively plan for the long -term health of the Association. Without an operating re serve, the Association can be thrown into cash flow stress and become distracted from good long -term decision -making or be forced to make expensive short -term crisis -based decisions, or worse; it may not have the resources to continue delivery of its progr ams. Associations with limited or negative working capital (bills greater than bank account) by necessity focus on the short term and are less likely to engage in responsible long -term planning. Thus, building operating reserves is a top priority H OW MUCH IS ENOUGH IN OPERATING RESERVE s? A minimum liquid operating reserve representing 25% of the annual operating expenses would be a good goal. The Association's capital budget should include figuring out how much the Association needs for its reserve (target amount), how many years it will take to reach the target amount, and what funding strategies will be employed for building the reserve. 3 FP 18 Created: December 2021 Reviewed: February 2023 FP 18 This is all in addition to planned capital expenditures such as a new tractor, van or building addition. GOOD DEBT, BAD DEBT It is an admirable goal for nonprofits to be completely free of debt, but this is not always possible. Good cash flow management may, on occasion, require an Association to access a cash flow loan or a line of credit. It is important to pay attention to the balance between the Association's liabilities and net assets, striving to keep net assets positive, and using debt only when it makes good management sense. Net assets are what the Association owns outright, minus what it owes. Put another way, net assets equal the oAssociation's assets (economic resources) minus liabilities (what is owed to someone else). Net assets are virtually the same as net equity (assets less liabilities) and it's the Association's monetary worth. \"Bad\" debt, such as being very far behind on vendor payments or maxed -out on cash flow loans, is not fiscally healthy and should be avoided and if incurred, targeted as a part of deficit reduction. When utilizing planned borrowing, be sure to factor related interest expenses into the expense budget. Payments to reduce the liability principal are not true expenses, but income to provide the cash required to pay down the liability should be included as an item in the budgeting process as part of the full Association budget. FURNITURE , EQUIPMENT , AND TECHNOLOGY For an Association not in financial crisis, investing in equipment and software upgrades or replacements is one of t he items to consider for a capital budget. For example: A working kitchen would need, at a minimum, a stove, refrigerator, table and chairs. An operational office would need ample desks, computers, filing cabinets and office chairs. Keeping staff well -equipped can make them more efficient and happier, leading to staff retention and loyalty while improving program outcomes. The Association would support fixed asset acquisition and technology improvements in addition to project and operating funding.

FACILITIES PART 1 - MAINTENANCE , REPAIR , & REPLACEM ENT As the Association owns the property it will likely become necessary to make improvements to the property. Anticipating what repairs or improvements may be necessary, researching and estimating the related costs, determining the target amount needed an d the approximate timing of the expenditures are all part of the capital budgeting process, along with developing funding strategies. In addition, the Association may want to create, budget for, and maintain an emergency fund, for unanticipated repairs. FACILITIES PART 2 - BUILDING ACQUISITION AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS A capital campaign supporting a new building project is a familiar scenario. This is a huge commitment for the Association and should be undertaken only after a great deal of preparation, inc luding an Association self -examination to ensure that the staff and board infrastructure can sustain the additional workload and fundraising effort, and a thorough feasibility study to ensure that the community can, and is willing to, support the endeavor. In addition, a multi- year business plan reflecting the financial impact of operating in the new building would need to be developed. Years of careful planning, research on financing options, and a great deal of caution are advised. The impact of a facilit y project on an Association cannot be underestimated.

Restricted funds provide reassurance to donors that their contributions are used in a manner they have chosen. This is covered in a separate policy.

Accrual- basis accounting - A system of financial recordkeeping in which transactions are recorded as expenses when they are incurred (i.e. when an invoice [bill] is received for goods or servi ces provided to the Association) and as income when it is earned i.e. when services are provided by the Association, or the Association receives a commitment of a contribution, rather than when cash is paid or received.

Restricted funds management is covered in a separate policy. (A restricted fund is a reserve account that contains money that can only be used for spe cific purposes.) A key component of financial sustainability is the commitment of board and staff to financial management that includes timely review of financial reports, advance planning and preapproval of disbursements (expenses). The way that board and staff plan for income and expenses in the future is by creating and managing a budget. Pre -approval and management of the budget is one of the fundamental FP 19 Created: April 2021 2 Reviewed February 2023 FP 19 building blocks of sound financial management and the Association's solvency. The revenue (income) o f the Association must be greater than the disbursements (expenses). The Association must not operate on a deficit. Staff who make unauthorized purchases will be required to repay the Association. Budget management is a key element in our Association's fin ancial planning system. A collaborative budget process is essential to ensure that resources are being used most effectively to meet our mission and that our Association remains sustainable and accountable to its stakeholders. PROCEDURES ANNUAL BUDGET Creating the annual budget is initially staff's responsibility, but board members on the finance committee review the proposed budget and the full board adopts the budget at a board meeting. An approved budget is to be approved before the fiscal year begins i.e. by April 1st of each year. The annual approved budget then serves as a guide for financial activity in the months ahead. Budgets should not be \"written in stone\" because the financial position may change during the year. An annual budget is a guide that can help the Association plan for the future as well as assess its current financial health. The Finance Committee and the Board of Directors are to undertake a monthly review of the budget as well as compare it to the actual income and expenses, to determine whether action should be taken. It may be necessary to amend the budget during the year. It is important that emphasis be placed on income generation not just focusing on expenses. Each budget meeting would include planning to increase income. Sim ply \"cutting costs\" is not a viable operating basis. MONTHLY BUDGET Financial solvency is attained by managing the monthly budget. Using the annual budget as a guide, a monthly budget is prepared in advance. E.g. The budget for May is prepared and approved by the end of April. No disbursement is allowed until the monthly budget is approved. Each line item on the budget has a voice in the budget meeting. E.g. someone responsible represents food costs or farm costs or vehicle costs, etc. It is important that all involved in the monthly budget process understand that all disbursements must be approved in advance. The FP 19 Created: April 2021 3 Reviewed February 2023 FP 19 accounting department provides financial information to the budget committee. STEPS 1. A budget committee is formed representing each sector of the Association. There must be a representative that is active in this process. 2. Income planning is done before budget expense planning. Accounting provides income estimates based on confirmed revenue sources. 3. Each member comes to a budget meeting with their re quests for the coming month. THIS MUST COVER ALL LINE ITEMS ON THE MONTHLY BUDGET. In other words, every disbursement including payroll to be made in the following month must be approved in advance. 4. The monthly budget should include an allocation to go to the Operating Reserve account (a separate bank account). The Operating Reserve is utilized for major disbursements such as new equipment purchases, major building improvements, etc. This would be a percentage of the monthly income. The operating reserve ac count is not used to \"bail out\" over expenditures in monthly purchases. 5. Accounting prepares a report of the past months actual expenses by the 15th of the month. E.g. total expenses for April are reported to the budget committee by May 15th for the June budget. Earlier months actual income and expenses can also be provided. It is imperative that all staff submit disbursement receipts in a timely manner. 6. The members of the budget committee meet and cooperate to present a balanced budget for the coming month. Ideally a surplus (income greater than expenses) is budgeted. 7. The monthly budget is approved. 8. Expenditures are made for the month, never exceeding the income. 9. Repeat . OVER BUDGET It may occur that some part of the overall monthly budget is expected to be \"over budget\". These are potential solutions to remedy this as the total monthly budget can never be \"over budget\". For example: Cut back on some other part of the budget. FP 19 Created: April 2021 4 Reviewed February 2023 FP 19 Get an allocation from a different part of the budget. E.g. There is an emergency repair needed but there are no funds left in the maintenance budget. A possible solution is to get funds from some other part of the unspent budget with the approval in advance of the finance committee. In any event the monthly budget should never run an overall deficit. Set up a budget contingency amount in each monthly budget for an unexpected expense. For instance, a 2 percent contingency could be included in the monthly budget. Any use of the contingency sum must be approved in advance by the finance committee. Any unused contingency would be carried forward to the next month's budget.

This will be a separate bank account: \"Operating Reserves\". The Operating Reserve is a designated fund set aside by action of the B oard of Directors. The intention of the Operating Reserve is to ensure the stability of the mission, programs, and operations of the Association. Operating Reserves are different from restricted funds. Restricted funds are grants and contributions that hav e been received for specific programs or projects. These funds are \"restricted\" for use according to the grant agreement or donor's instructions. A separate restricted bank account is maintained. Operating Reserves, on the other hand, are \"unrestricted\" funds that can be used for specific purposes with Board approval. The target minimum operating reserve fund for the Association is three (3) months of average operating costs. PROCEDURE FUNDING OF THE OPERATING RESERVE The operating reserve will be funded with: Funds that have been received but some or all will need to be repaid. E.g. government funding such CEBA (Canada Emergency Business Account) $40,000 of which $30,000 will need to be repaid. Monthly allocation from the operating budget. The Board of Di rectors may from time to time direct that a specific source of revenue be set aside for operating reserves. Examples may include one -time gifts or bequests, special grants, or special appeals. DISBURSEMENTS FROM THE OPERATING RESERVE To use the operating reserves, a written request would be submitted to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The request will include the analysis and determination of the use of funds and plans for replenishment.

What we eat is closely related to good health. Poor nutrition is a risk factor for leading causes of death including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer. Nutrition -related chronic diseases are placing new demands on an already overburdened healthcare system and taking their toll on human productivity and quality of l ife. Our emphasis will be on fresh fruits and vegetables, quality animal products, whole grains, and other foods important for health. We will avoid as possible highly refined, \"factory\" produced foods. Through our own sustainable agricultural practices an d informed food purchasing decisions, we can promote health by providing fresh, good tasting, nutritious food for the Glenora Farm community. Our farm can help improve health outcomes by supporting a more sustainable food system. A sustainable agriculture and food system protects the environment and human health. It meets needs for food and fiber while supporting the economic viability of our community. Through our on -site farm and purchasing practices, we can help achieve the following: Promote good nutrit ion by offering a range of healthy foods Support good eating habits and model a healthy food environment Reduce antibiotic resistance by raising and buying poultry and meat produced without the use of antibiotics Reduce air and water pollution by providing fresh, locally grown foods whenever possible Support local food systems that avoid long -distance travel Grow, buy and serve foods grown without pesticides, such as organic foods, and reduce exposure to harmful pesticides. Buying food produced in ways that are ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially responsible also supports a food system that ultimately benefits healthier individuals and communities.

Centralized purchasing is the administration by one team member of all food and supplies purchasing that is undertaken. This allows for more efficient management and volume purchases that lead to better prices and t erms as well as the ability to work with larger suppliers. This central control enables more efficient inventory control and the ability to build better relationships with suppliers. Advantages of centralized purchasing: Duplication of Coworker efforts and resulting costs are negated and all activities are standardized. Coworkers would no longer have to spend time on purchasing. Volume purchasing means that better prices, greater discounts and more agreeable terms can be obtained. Volume deliveries cut down on delivery charges and staffing costs to move and store goods. Computerized systems can be used to automate much of the work as well as integrate the purchasing systems with accounting and stock control. Centralized records can be kept of all purchases. 3 FP24 Created: October 2020 Reviewed February 2023 FP24 Coworkers can be trained in purchasing and how to minimize costs. Suppliers know where and whom to contact which makes supplier contact much easier. Coworkers responsible for purchasing can build good relationships with the buyers that enable the supplier to understand the community needs and suggest other products that may be more suitable and cost effective. It allows for better control of inventories so that they can be kept at optimum levels. In summary, the duties of the Cowor ker responsible for purchasing would include seeking reliable suppliers to provide quality goods at the best possible prices, negotiating terms, delivery and contracts.

Segregation of duties - A key feature of internal financial controls is to ensure that no single i ndividual has sole responsibility for any single transaction from authorization to completion and review. The most common form of fraud is misappropriation of assets, in which a Coworker, Contractor or executive of the Association uses their position to misuse funds of the Association. Examples of fraud: Falsified expense reports Theft of services, inventory, time or company property Purchases from fake vendors Credit card abuse including personal expenses Falsified time sheets to get pay for hours not worked 3 FP26 Created: June 2021 Reviewed February 2023 FP26 Supervisor and leadership pre -signed cheques which get used for personal purposes Unreported personal use of Association vehicles or equipment Cheque forgery and tampering Kickbacks or collusion, in which a Coworker or Contractor receives payments from a third party in exchange for cash or other advantages Financial statement fraud, in which a director, Supervisor, leadership team member, Coworker or Contractor alters balance sheets, profit & loss, or cash flow statements with the intention to deceive or to gain some benefit or personal gain BUDGET CONTROL One of the most important financial monitoring activities is budgetary control, i.e. monitoring the financial performance against a budget. Proper and realistic estimates of income and expenditure need to be made for each area of the charity's programs and activities for each financial year. The overall budget will be set, which the Directors should agree upon before the start of the financial year. There should be procedures for sharing monthly or periodic financial information with budget holders, Directors, Supervisors and leadership. Monitoring procedures should identify and seek explanations for significant over or underperformance of both incom e and expenditures. Other monitoring activities include a review of expected sources of income and the actual income received. Monitoring can also help to ensure that any restrictions placed on the use of funds are identified and reporting requirements to funders are met. FINANCIAL REPORTING Directors need access to accurate and up -to-date financial information to enable them to make proper decisions. Board of Directors meetings should be used to communicate information concerning the finances and financial management. All decisions by the Directors concerning finances should be taken collectively and significant decisions and action points noted in writing. The financial information provided should always be understandable, accurate and timely. Information also needs to be provided regularly to ensure Directors can fulfill their monitoring role. The financial information provided at each Board of Directors meeting should include details of the charity's financial position and performance. The financ ial information should be sent to eachDirector before each meeting and will typically include: 4 FP26 Created: June 2021 Reviewed February 2023 FP26 The latest financial statements (Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss) A comparison of budget to actual figures An explanation for variances between forecasts and what actually happened Details of cash flow and bank balances The meeting should set aside a specific time within the agenda for discussion of financial matters and allow the Directors to raise any issues of concern. AUDIT ASSIGNMENT - CPA REVIEW ENGAGEMENT The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the audit function of the independent CPA firm. The understanding of internal controls assists the auditor in assessing the risks of material misstate ment, which in turn assists in designing and implementing audit responses that are tailored to a client's assessed risks.

Charities must always comply with legal requirements and these requirements are identified in the checklist as they relate to the bookkeeper's duties and responsibilities. A 'yes' answer for good practice recommendations does not mean there is no scope for further improvement. A 'no' answer does not always indicate a problem. It may be that the charity has not put in place a particular control because the risk involved is small and the potential loss is acceptable, given the cost that would be involved in putting in place stronger internal controls. Finally, the answers in the chec klist should be based on the bookkeeper's knowledge of what actually happens in the charity as it relates to her position.

PROCEDURE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Association's financial statements differ from those issued by businesses. The Association issues the following financial statements: A. Statement of Financial Position ( Balance Sheet) The Statement of Financial Position lists the assets held by the Association and the amount of all debt owed. It also includes the nonprofit's net assets, which is the overall value of the Association, similar to the equity reported by busin esses. Assets - Liabilities = Net Assets (Equity) B. Statement of Activities (Profit & Loss) The Statement of Activities reports the revenues (income) and disbursements (expenses) during a specific reporting period. C. Statement of Cash Flows The State ment Of Cash Flows reports on all cash flowing into and out of the Association. Specifically, the statement demonstrates the extent to which the Association's programs and activities generate and use money. CHART OF ACCOUNTS These are the main categories for the chart of accounts: A. Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) 1. Assets: 1000 -1999 Bank accounts, accounts receivable, buildings, equipment 2.

Non -Operating Expenses 9000 -9999 Extraordinary or restricted disbursements FUNCTIONAL & NATURAL CLASSES The Association reports their expenses by both functional and natural class. Natural expense classification This is a method of grouping expenses according to the kinds of economic benefits received in incurring those expenses. Examples of natural expense classifications include wages, supplies, interest expense, premises maintenance, utilities, and depreciation. Functional expense classification This is a method of grouping expenses a ccording to the purpose for which costs are incurred. The primary functional classifications of a not -for-profit entity are program services and supporting services. C. Statement of Cash Flows STATEMENT OF FUNCTIONAL EXPENSES FP28 Created: September 2021 3 Reviewed February 2023 P28 The Statement Of Functional Expenses explains the costs incurred for each functional area of the Association. The functional classifications include: Programs Management and general Fundraising FUNCTIONAL EXPENSE ALLOCATION To better grasp functional expense allocation, it helps to understand why it's important for the Association to report their expenses by function. The audience of the Association's financial reporting includes funders, donors, boards of directors as well a s government agencies. These stakeholders are mainly interested in the relationship between the Association's program expenses and its supporting expenses. They want to see how the Association's supporting costs relate to and drive its programs. Functional expense allocation makes it clear to the Association's stakeholders how its natural expenses help support the programs and services. FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS The Association records expenses according to these functional classifications: Programs Program expenses are any costs related to running the various programs and services offered as per our mission. Program expenses often make up the majority of the overall costs. Management and General Management and general costs are supporting expenses associated with managing the day -to- day operations of the Association. These expenses don't directly relate to the mission of the nonprofit and usually include costs like bookkeeping and general management. Fundraising Fundraising costs are supporting expenses ass ociated with the Association's call for financial support or monetary contributions. This would include expenses related to fundraising including events, direct mail campaigns, requesting donations and the salaries of Coworkers or Contractors working on fu ndraising.

Payroll Timesheets: Payroll will be coded to allocate expenses based on actual hours worked in each functional category. This will also be very useful when reporting to government agencies. Direct Costs: There are some expenses that only relate to one classification type such as: food (programs), accounting (management and general) and promotion (fundraising).

For \"live -in\" Coworker that are provided a place to live and eat, this is known as \"room and board\". This amount includes rent and any meals that are provided to Coworker. The Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) states that free housing and meals provided to an employee is a taxable benefit and must be reported. The fair market value of the room and board will be a payroll deduction. This procedure would be included in Coworker and Contractor agreements and hiring forms. The rate charged by the Association to the domestic Coworker or Contractor for room and board must be included in the employment contr act. PROCEDURE Fair market value is defined as \"a selling price for an item to which a buyer (Coworker/Contractor) and seller (the Association) can agree\". To determine the room and board fair market value, one method is to compare the prices others have paid for something comparable, often called \"market value\". The value of room and board should be equal to the same services in an active market. The active market would be local property listing using accommodations similar to what are being provided. According to 2020's annual research, the market value for room and board provided is hereby set at $1000 per single adult person per month. Room only is $500 per month. Food only is $250 per month. Children (up to 13 years old) are charged only for food at $1 25 per month.

This is called a reserve fund policy. There are many reasons to have a reserve fund policy including that it forces the Board of Directors to consider what amount of reserves is reasonable and having adequate reserves is important for the long term sustainability of an organization . In terms of the reser ve fund policy, if you have a $10 million foundation and are not asking anyone to donate to your foundation you don't need to have a reserve fund policy. If you are a charity with no reserves, then you don't have a reserve and therefore do not need a reser ve fund policy. There is nothing wrong with charities having reserves - in fact having unrestricted funds is vital for most charities to respond to fluctuations in income and different expenditure requirements. The public and even many in the charity sector may not understand the difference between assets, endowments, perpetual endowments, reserves, cash, etc. They may see funds listed as assets and assume that these are freely available for expenditure by the charity. A charity may have assets of $10 mil lion. That does not mean that this money is ready to be spent. For example: It may all be tied up in a building that is used for the charity's charitable programs. It may be part of a perpetual endowment to be used for some purposes. It may be funds from the government or another funder that have to be used for a particular program. The objects of the charity may be quite limited. It is suggested that charities that have reserves and do not yet have a reserve fund policy think about crafting one and making it public to minimize risk to the charity's reputation. PROCEDURE RESERVED FUNDS AND GIFTS The Association will have a reserve fund policy if the Association has assets and wishes to fundraise further. The Association will check all restricted gifts as t o \"Whether they are actually restricted?\", \"What the restrictions are?\", \"Whether there is an ability in the gift FP31 Created: June 2021 2 Reviewed February 2023 FP31 agreement to amend the agreement?\", Whether there is a 'cy pres' clause in the gift agreement which allows for changes to the use of the funds in certain circumstances?\". The Association will check its objects and consider whether they should be changed to give more flexibility to deal with future circumstances. Charities are only supposed to do charitable programs within their objects. The As sociation will be cautious about accepting restricted gifts as circumstances can change rapidly. If you must accept a restricted gift, make sure there is an amendment clause and a cy pres clause. For example, if the donor dies and the board thinks it is in the best interest of the organization to adjust the purpose of the gift. Most traditional perpetual endowments are the least flexible way for a charity to hold money - they also are often unavailable in times when money is needed the most. The Association will ensure that donors have the ability to provide unrestricted gifts. For example: General, unrestricted fund. If you are asking in a public appeal, make sure that the appeal is broad enough in terms of purposes. Perhaps also have a secondary purpose if (optimistically speaking) a large amount of funds is raised. The Association does not want to have money in their bank account that they cannot use - whether a large amount or a small amount. If things go poorly, the Association may have to go to court for a cy pres order. It is costly and time - consuming to convince a judge that the funds raised should be able to be spent on a different project. If the Association has a large reserve and does not need to fundraise at the moment, then discretion will be had regarding the level of fundraising being done and communication shared with donors and the public. The Association will also give thought to working with others including back -office partnerships, mergers, etc. that could be necessary to retain the health of the Association. The Association will kindly request that disbursements from funders be considered unrestricted. Depending on the nature of the funds, it may not be possible. FUNDRA ISING GUIDANCE The Association can only raise funds that are necessary to fulfill their mand ates. Fundraising activities should not be undertaken simply because the Association has the opportunity to raise additional funds. There must be an identified use or need for the money. Depending on the Association's particular circumstances, an identifie d use or need could include funds required for current and ongoing charitable (and other FP31 Created: June 2021 3 Reviewed February 2023 FP31 acceptable) activities or funds to be maintained as reserves. However, when the Association has sufficient income for its identified uses or needs, the need for new fundraising may be questionable. Canadian law requires that the Association be established and operated for charitable purposes and devote its resources to charitable activities. While the CRA recognizes that the Association can, and often should, maintain r eserves, fundraising that results in an unjustified level of reserves may indicate that the Association is failing to meet this requirement. Justifying the Association's level of reserves means being able to demonstrate, by reference to the Association's current position and future prospects, why holding a particular level of reserves is right at that time. For example, the Association might reasonably anticipate an economic downturn that will reduce its donation income in the next fiscal year, which it can make up for by spending part of its reserves on its charitable activities. The Association will not engage in fundraising without an identified use or need for the proceeds. When the Association initiates new fundraising activities, it should be able to show it has considered: the ability of current revenues and reserves to meet existing and reasonably projected organizational needs; and specific plans for the additional funds to be raised and the capacity of the Association to implement these plans. The Association is responsible for ensuring that its fundraising appeals do not misrepresent the financial position of the Association. MAINTAINING A RESERVE FUND POLICY A reserve fund policy may assist the Association when planning, explaining, and justifyi ng its approach to fundraising to donors and to the CRA. It may help to ensure that the Association fundraises with an identifiable use or need, reducing the risk of failing to devote resources to charitable activities or engaging in fundraising that forms a collateral purpose. A transparent and publicly accessible policy may also help ensure that fundraising appeals are not misleading or deceptive by misrepresenting the Association's financial position and the extent or urgency of its need for funds. FP31 Created: June 2021 4 Reviewed February 2023 FP31 The size of a justifiable reserve fund will depend on the Association's particular situation. When establishing a reserve fund, the Association will show it has taken into account factors such as: its typical annual expenditures its size its long -term plan s its donor base its projected revenue its current and projected economic conditions anticipated changes to the environment in which the charity operates contingencies known risks being faced It is important that the policy be reviewed periodically to take into account the changing needs of the Association. Responsibility of : Business Administrator, Bookkeeper, Finance Committee Monitored by : Business Administrator, Board of Directors and Executive Group FP32 Created: December 2021 1 Reviewed: February 2023 FP32 US FUNDS ACCOUNTING POLICY Accounting standards require that the Association's financial statements be recorded in one currency i.e. Canadian funds. However, the Association has some American vendors who are paid in US funds. The Association holds a US funds bank account to disburse funds to American Vendors. This sets out the procedures to follow to implement this. PROCEDURE This procedure allows the organization to have a foreign currency bank account - while still ensuring that the asset, and the revenues and expenses, are properl y stated at their Canadian values in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices. ACCOUNTING SYSTEM The accounting system must accomplish the following: Record the amount of the foreign currency in the US funds bank account. If there are $3,4 56 US dollars in the US bank account, that's the number that should be shown on the US Funds Bank account and on the balance sheet. Record the correct value of that asset. (Thus, if there are $3,456 US dollars and today's rate is 1.23, those US dollars are presently worth $3,456 x 1.23 = $4,250.88 Canadian.) Record US revenues and expenses at the Canadian equivalent. Thus, if $2,500 of those US dollars is used to pay a vendor, then record an expense of $3,075 as calculated above. PAIRING THE US BANK ACCOUNT The US bank account will be paired with a second general ledger asset account, named \"Revalue US Dollars\". The US funds bank account captures the numerical amount of the foreign currency currently held. The paired account captures the difference in value to the Canadian dollar. Thus, if $3,456 US dollars is held and the exchange rate was 1.23, the Revalue US Dollars account would contain $794.88. PAYME NT EXAMPLE If $2,500 of the US funds is used to pay a vendor, then record an expense of $3,075. FP32 Created: December 2021 2 Reviewed: February 2023 FP32 The entry to pay an American vendor would be: January 21, 20xx Debit - Expense account $3,075 Credit - US Bank Account $2,500 Credit - Revalue US Dollar $575 This entry states the true cost of the expense; it updates the US bank balance correctly; and it revalues the asset (the US funds) according to today's exchange rate. DEPOSIT EXAMPLE An American organization/family remitted funds in US dollars. If they paid $45.00 US when the US dollar was worth 1.23, the deposit entry would be: January 21, 20xx Debit - US Bank Account $45.00 Credit - Revenue $55.35 Debit - Revalue US Dollar $10.35 At the current exchange rate the revenue was $55.35 Canadian. REVALUE US DOLLAR ACCOUNT As the fiscal year proceeds, there will be any number of transactions, each valued at the current day's exchange rate. Because the rate floats up and down, the amount in the \"Revalue US Dollar\" account eventually becomes inaccurate. For that reason, it's important to \"adjust\" the value of the US dollar account from time to time. As needed, the Association will make a separate entry on the last day of the month or quarterly to update the US currency to the month -end rate. GAIN OR LOSS ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE FP32 Created: December 2021 3 Reviewed: February 2023 FP32 Using the examples above, which started with $3,456.00 US dollars. $2,500.00 was spent and $45.00 deposited - bringing the US accou nt balance to $1,001.00. And, the Revalue US Dollar account started at $794.88; $575.00 was deducted and $10.35 was added, bringing the account balance to $230.23. For example: The exchange rate on the last day of the month was 1.25. At that rate, a balance of $1,001.00 is actually worth $1,251.25. The month -end balance sheet misstates the value of the US dollars. The following entry \"trues up\" to the current Canadian equivalent. January 31, 20xx To adjust the US dollar value per month end rate of $1.25 Debit Revalue US Dollar $20.02 Credit Gain or Loss on Foreign Exchange $20.02 Note that this adjustment isn't tied to any particular transaction: it simply corrects for the month -end exchange rate. The \"pick -up\" is allocated to a revenue account that specifically captures currency gain or loss. In months when the US dollar increases in value, a gain is recorded, because the US Funds are worth more. But, when the Canadian dollar increases, a loss on the American currency would be recorded. Responsibility of : Business Administrator, Bookkeeper, Finance Committee Monitored by : Business Administrator, Board of Directors and Finance Committee FP33 Created: June 2021 1 Reviewed: February 2023 FP33 RESTRICTED FUNDS POLICY A restricted fund is a reserve bank account that contains money that can only be disbursed for specific purposes. Restricted funds provide reassurance to donors that their contributions are used in a manner that they have specified. A restricted fund is a bank account that has been earmarked for specific or limited use. Restricted funds ensure that donors alone can direct the usage of those assets. Failure to comply with restrictions or unauthorized use of restricted funds can result in adverse public relations, penalties and even legal action. When a donor gives money to The Ita Wegman Association, they may specify whether the gift is unrestricted and thus can be used for any purpose the Association sees fit. If the funds are temporarily restricted, they must be used for a specific purpose. With permanently restricted funds, the donation acts as principal on which interest can be earned but only the interest can be spent. Externally restricted funds have \"restrictions\" imposed by a funder or donor. For example, BC Gaming provided a grant to purchase a passenger van. Those funds are temporarily restricted and thus are only to be spent on a van purchase. PROCEDURE DESIGNATION OF A RESTRICTED FUND A separate bank account \"Restricted Funds\" is to be maintained. The donor determines if the funds are to be restricted. Typically, fund designation is specified in writing or through an agreement with the organization. When establishing an externally restricted fund, it's important to align on goals with the funding source so both parties are clear on what the funds can, and can't, be used for. Also understand the funder's reporting requirements so that the books and reporting frequencies are accommodated. Restricted funds must be accounted for separately in the financial statements. When budgeting , the Association will separate restricted and unrestricted fun ds so that the funds are spent correctly. An internal system will be implemented that alerts the Finance Committee FP33 Created: June 2021 2 Reviewed: February 2023 FP33 when restricted fund obligations have been met; once the donor's wishes are satisfied, the excess funds can be transferred to unrestricted funds. MANAGING RESTRICTED FUNDS Restricted funds are held in a separate bank account. The donor may require an additional restricted funds account specific to that donation. For example, BC Gaming required a separate restricted funds bank account. The Association will use class tracking functionality in the accounting software and the fund accounting method for reporting purposes. In QuickBooks, create classes that are ass igned to transactions. This \"tracks\" fund account balances by recording additional fund income and disbursement information. Use the class tracking functionality in QuickBooks to: Record revenues and disbursements relating to specific funds Ensure that fun ds are used in accordance with any restrictions Class tracking functionality streamlines reporting obligations and keeps the Association accountable. By generating \"Profit & Loss\" statements by class, the revenues and disbursements for specific funds are clearly reported. The Association will review fund transactions monthly to highlight bookkeeping and reporting errors. Reconcile f und bank account(s) monthly at a minimum. The Association will prepare monthly and share a single fund summary report to help keep the restrictions and reporting requirements for separate funds clear all times.

Responsibility of: House Coordinator s, Workshop Leaders Monitored by: Facility Manager HSP8 Created: June 2017 1 Revi 2023 HSP8 RESTRAINT/ SECLUSION POLICY The Ita Wegman Association maintains a restraint and seclusion -free environment using awareness and preventative measures, to educate and support both C ompanions and Coworker s, and to limit any potentially harmful interactions. DEFINITION : The process of c ontrolling a situation or behavior that could become harmful or dangerous. DESCRIPTION : When a situation occurs whereby a C ompanion is threatening or otherwise hurting themselves or others, Coworkers will intervene and, if necessary, apply a minimal amount of physical intervention, essentially calmly and gently protecting the C ompanion from harming themselves or others. Restraint is only used when all other less intrusive approaches have been unsuccessful at keeping the C ompanion and those around them safe. PROCEDURES Physical Intervention Training and Education All Coworker s must successfully complete an orientation on the policies and procedures governing the use of restraint techniques within 30 days of assuming the role of a Coworker with The Ita Wegman Association and annually thereafter. All Coworker s must successfully complete a minimum of 8 hours of training in nonviolent crisis intervention (CPI) after commencement of assuming the role of a Coworker with The Ita Wegman Association. Annual training is mandatory thereafter to update skills and maintain certification. All legal guardians/ family representatives are informed and educated on our restraint approach, prior to support commencing. Questions or concerns involving the use of restraint are addressed and resolved before a Companion is admitted into our programs. Guidelines All Coworker s must act in good faith and in the best interest of Companion s being supported at all times. Every effort must be made to ensure reasonable care is taken to avoid harm and protect all concerned. Companions receiving support fr om the Ita Wegman Association have the right to be free from any physical restraint imposed for the purposes of discipline or convenience. Any written individual plan or protocol must specify the procedure(s) or action(s) that need to be taken in order to respond appropriately in the event of a crisis situation. RULES GOVERNING THE USE OF CRISIS INTERVENTION The use of physical restraints is prohibited except as a last resort where the safety of self, HSP8 Created: June 2017 2 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP8 other Companions or Coworkers is at risk and only after Non -Violent Crisis Intervention alternatives have been tried. It is unacceptable to threaten the use of physical containment as a means of managing disruptive verbal behaviours. Use of physical restraint must involve using the least amount of force necessary for the shortest possible duration. (Ensure the safety, care, welfare, and security of the Com panion) A Coworker may only carry out physical restraint of a C ompanion if they hold current certification in CPI and received orientation (and annual review) in the rules governing use of physical restraints . Restraint must be regularly rehearsed among team members. During physical restraint of a Companion , their condition must be continually monitored and assessed. Physical restraint of a Companion must be stopped upon the earlier of the following: When there is no longer a clear and imminen t risk that the Companion will physically injure or further physically injure him or herself or others. When there is a risk that the physical restraint itself will endanger the health and safety of the Companion or the person restraining. When, clearly, the restraint proves ineffective in assisting the Companion to regain control, call the police. First Aid: Assess the Companion for injury and provide first aid if required, and seek further medical attention if required DE-BRIEFING /POSTVENTION Critical Incidents will be followed by a debriefing process. Refer to EP14 Critical Incident Debrief ing ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING Restraint/ Seclusion is a Critical Incident. Coworkers refer to HSP9 Critical Incident procedures and HSP10 Critical Incident Report Form . Responsibility of : All Coworkers Monitored by: House Coordinator, Workshop Leader, Facility Manager 1 HSP9 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP9 CRITICAL INCIDENTS DEFINITION Critical incidents are defined as those incidents, which are serious, have significant impact upon individuals and are not typically viewed as normal occurrences or behaviour. Critical incidents are further defined as major medical emergencies (including allegations and disclosures of abuse, neglect, harmful behavior), major police incidents, fire, bomb, natural disaster or other major emergency including, but not limited to, the following: Aggression between persons in care Aggression between persons in care means aggressive behaviour by a person in care towards another person in care that causes an injury that requires a) first aid, b) emergency care by a medical practitioner or nurse pract itioner, or c) transfer to a hospital. Aggressive/ Unusual behaviour Aggressive or unusual behaviour by an individual that results in harm and/or causes significant concern. Harm can be done to property or a person. Harm to a person can be physical or emot ional harm, and can be towards themselves, another supported individual, staff or others. Unusual behaviour means behaviour that is unusual FOR THE PERSON. Attempted Suicide Attempt by an individual to intentionally self -harm for the purpose of taking thei r own life. Suicidal threats are not critical incidents, but they should be recorded as non -reportable incidents by the service provider and reported to a healthcare professional. If there is a pattern of suicidal threats or suicidal ideation, it is import ant that the service provider follow- up with a healthcare professional. Choking An individual's airway is obstructed, requiring first aid, emergency care by a medical practitioner or nurse practitioner, or transfer to a hospital. Choking is a prevalent cau se of death among individuals. All choking incidents that do not require first aid or any type of immediate medical assistance and are not reportable as critical incidents, should be recorded as non -reportable incidents by the service provider and reported to a healthcare professional. Death - expected/ unexpected Any death of a person. Disease Outbreak An outbreak or the occurrence of a disease above the incident level beyond that which is normally expected, including a communicable disease or parasite suc h as scabies. Transmission can be by direct or indirect contact with infected persons or with their excretions in the air, water, food or on surfaces or equipment. 2 HSP9 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP9 Emergency Restraint / Seclusion/ Restriction of Rights Use of physical, mechanical, chemical or other means to temporarily subdue or limit the freedom of movement of a person in care. Includes containment, which is restraining a person's freedom of movement within a certain area, e.g. half door that contains a person within one room, locked exits, or locking seat belt in vehicle. Restraint protocols must be part of an approved Behaviour Support Plan. Each incident must be reported and documented on a person's served file. Restraints that are required for medical purposes only as prescribed by a h ealth care professional (i.e. not required for behavioural purposes) are not considered restricted practices and do not need to be reported as critical incidents. Emotional Abuse Means any act, or lack of action, which may diminish the sense of dignity of a person in care, perpetrated by a person who is not in care, such as verbal harassment, yelling or confinement. Emotional abuse may include: intimidation, withholding needed medication, censoring mail, invitation or denial of privacy or denial of access t o visitors.

Medication Err or An error in the administration of a medication, which adversely affects a person receiving services or requires emergency intervention or transfer to a hospital. Medication errors that do not result in emergency care by a medical or nurse practitioner o r transfer to a hospital should be recorded by the service provider as non reportable incidents. Missing/ Wandering Unscheduled or unexplained absence of an individual from a CLBC funded service. An absence is considered unscheduled or unexplained if it is unusual for the individual, the service provider is unaware of their location, and the behaviour is not reflected in a Behaviour Support and Safety Plan. Motor Vehicle Injury Injury to an individual as a result of a motor vehicle accident while participat ing in a CLBC funded service. Neglect Alleged or actual failure of a service provider to meet the individual's needs, including the need for food, shelter, medical attention or supervision, which endangers the individual's safety.

Physical Abuse Alleged of actual excessive or inappropriate physical force directed at an individual by a person in a position of authority or trust, including: a staff member or volunteer or a person who is not responsible for providing services and is not a supported individual. The alleged or actual phys ical abuse is perpetrated against the individual. This critical incident type is never about the individual's actions towards a staff or any other persons. Poisoning, Food Poisoning Illness of an individual requiring emergency care by a medical practitio ner or nurse practitioner, or transfer to a hospital, including food poisoning. Food poisoning is a food borne illness involving an individual that requires emergency care. Service Delivery Problems Condition or event that could impair or interrupt the abi lity of a service provider and its staff to provide care to an individual and which affects the individual's health, safety, dignity, or wellbeing. For example, a sudden illness of a caregiver. Other events that may affect service delivery but are not crit ical incidents including incarceration and expected hospitalization must be recorded by the service provider. In these situations, the service provider should contact their liaison analyst to inform them that the individual is expected to be away from serv ice. Sexual Abuse Any sexual behaviour directed towards a person receiving services by an employee, volunteer or any other person in a position of trust, power, or authority and includes: any sexual exploitation whether consensual or not.

POLICY In situations that are deemed critical, the safety and well -being of C ompanions and Coworkers is of primary concern. All critical incidents must be immediately dealt with by the Senior Coworker present and involve emergency response personnel (police, fire, ambulance), if necessary. Reporting for a critical incident must be completed immediately and forwarded to the Facility Manager. 4 HSP9 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP9 The Facility Manager will report the critical incident to all appropriate municipal and provincial government authorities i.e. Licensing Authorities or Worksafe BC, as necessary. In case of a power outage and / or failure to report a critical incident to Community Living BC (CLBC), or with the Island Health e -Incident Form, call CLBC and Island Health immediately leaving a message to report the critical incident taking place and file the Critical Incident Report Form as soon as possible. PROCEDURES Coworkers will provide for the immediate treatment of injured parties, notifying emergency response personnel as appropriate. If the incident is not covered under existing policies and/ or procedures, Coworkers will enlist whatever internal or external support and/or expertise required to support the need / situation. When it is safe to do so, the attending Coworker will notify the Facility Manager. All critical incidents will be recorded and documented by the attending Coworkers using HSP10 Critical Incident Report Form and forwarded to the Facility Manager. The Facility Manager will determine follow -up action. In case of a power outage, please call CLBC / MCFD's Provincial Centralized Screening at 1-800-663-9122 and leave a phone message with Island Health at 250 - 370 - 8699. Critical Incident debriefing will occur in accordance with EP14 Critical Incident Debriefing . REPORTING GUIDELINES Please include only factual information when describing a critical incident report. This should include: why, who, where, how, and approximate times (when), also provide any direction given i.e. Doctor Jones prescribed aspirin to be administered 3 times daily. Include a sufficient amount of information so that if someone has never met any of the individuals involved, a clear picture will emerge about what happened. What happened leading up to the incident - what happened during the incident - what happened after the incident was over, and what follow up is anticipated? Do not include gues ses or opinions. Indicate at what approximate time people were contacted, what people stated, any badge numbers or file numbers Please ensure a copy of the report is forwarded to the Facility Manager immediately for review, follow up and further reporting requirements. Quarterly, all incidents are reviewed by the Facility Manager to look for trends. A report is created from this review to come up with recommendations if any are necessary. 5 HSP9 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP9 The original incident report should be held in a file/binder labeled Critical Incident Reports and kept in the office of The Ita Wegman Association in a secure and locked location.

OTHER 6 HSP10 Created: 2017 March 2022 Reviewed February 2023 HSP11 ADULT GUARDIANSHIP POLICY POLICY The Adult Guardianship Act, Part 3 provides the legal authority for ensuring that Companions who may require protection from abuse, neglect or self -neglect have access to timely response and support. This law is designed to promote every Companion's right to self- determination but it also recognizes the need for quick response and action should a Companion be in any danger related to abuse or neglect. This includes those circumstances where a Companion's ability to request, accept or receive support may be limited by their own circumstances or by those who are supporting them. PROCEDURE Companions may be vulnerable to abuse or neglect, sometimes unintentional, which exposes them to unacceptable risks. In some situations, Companions may not have families, friends or other apparent networks o f support to ensure their safety and well -being. The support and assistance offered will vary depending on a number of factors including access to personal support and the particular wishes and requirements of a Companion. If you are aware of a situation where it appears that a Companion is experiencing abuse or neglect, please notify the Facility Manager, who will notify the local CLBC office. CLBC staff are responsible for responding to these concerns including conducting an investigation, where appropriate, and determining how best to resolve the issues raised and support the Companion. If you decide to raise a concern or make a report, your identity will always remain anonymous unless you indicate otherwise. Although reporting allegations of abuse or neglect of an adult is not mandatory in British Columbia, The Ita Wegman Association encourages anyone who suspects it is occurring to report it as soon as possible to the Facility Manager who will contact the nearest Community Planning and Development Office. If contacting the Facility Manager is not possible for any reason, you should contact the nearest Community Planning and Development Office. Telephone 1- 855-390-7200 You will not be expected to remain involved or required to participate in any inves tigation or legal action but your simple act of notifying CLBC could make a very significant difference in the life of a Companion during a vulnerable period of their life. 2 HSP11 Created: March 2022 Reviewed February 2023 HSP11 DEFINITIONS To assist you in determining whether you should notify your Facility Manager or local Community Planning and Development Office of suspected abuse, self- abuse or neglect of an individual with a developmental disability, the following are the definitions provided by the Public Guardian and Trustee whose office is responsible for administering the Adult Guardianship Act: Abuse means deliberate mistreatment of an individual that causes the person: Physical, mental or emotional harm Damage to, or loss of, assets Intimidation, humiliation, physical assault, sexual assaul t, overmedication, withholding medication, limiting privacy, denying access to visitors, etc. Neglect means: Failure to provide necessary care, assistance, guidance or attention to an adult that causes or is soon likely to cause serious physical, mental or emotional harm or otherwise put the individual at risk Self-neglect means: Failure of an adult to tak e care of her or himself to the extent that it causes or is soon likely to cause serious physical or mental harm or damage or loss to assets or property.

Medication ordered by a physician may not be discontinued or dosage changed without consultation with the physician. All changes to medication are to be forwarded to the House Coordinator. Coworkers need to recognize that a Companion can be unaware of the side effects, precautions necessary or risks that can occur with medications. Each Companion should be supported to obtain complete information from the physician, pharmacist and other resources available. Prior to the medication being started, Coworker s will read the medication monitoring form provided by the pharmacy that lists each drug and its side effects. All such information is to be kept in the Companion 's documentation binder or in the online system. Each Companion should be supported to understand the information about the administration of their medication and the appropriate use of over the counter drugs. 2 HSP14 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP14 Medical appointments should review the effectiveness and appropriateness of medication on a regular and as needed basis. Any recognized adverse effects must be reported immediately to the Companion 's physician and resulting recommendations implemented. ANNUAL REVIEWS At least annually, or more freq uently, as appropriate, medications and treatments will be reviewed by MS AC with each Companion . A list of medications will be maintained and reviewed with each Companion , including those who self -administer. Support agreements shall be amended for major c hanges in medication and treatments or changes in the support required to administer. The annual review should address issues such as side effects, mixing prescription medication with over the counter drugs, alcohol, cannabis, etc. as outlined below. Each Companion who requires support to administer their medication will receive support geared to their specific needs. Each Companion 's support plan will clarify the assistance a Companion requires to move toward self- administration. This plan will incorporate a Companion's strengths and will be reviewed on a regular basis by the Companion with help from other people involved in their life. For additional safety, support should be provided to assist each Companion with specific medical challenges, to purchase medic -alert bracelets or necklaces. Other practices may be incorporated to increase safety and minimize risk of medication error. P RESCRIPTION FULFILLMENT AND PAYMENT Prescriptions for medication shall be filled at the pharmacy of the Companion 's choice. The B.C. Care Card covers most Companion medications. These care cards must be supplied to the pharmacy when ordering. The Companion pays for medications not covered by the care plan. MSAC (MEDICATION SAFETY ADVISORY COMMITTEE ) Each Companion will have a designated MSAC consisting of the House Coordinator and the dispensing pharmacist. The MSAC will conduct a medication revi ew annually, including: inspection of the medication storage area and practices, review of training processes, inspection of MAR documentation, review of Standing Order Authorizations, inspection of first aid box 3 HSP14 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February is responsible for maint aining up -to-date medication records (provided by the dispensing pharmacy), which are to be stored near the medication and made accessible to all Coworkers administering medication.

PROCEDURES P ROCEDURE FOR PURCHASING AND MAINTENANCE OF MEDICATION AND SUPPLY OF MEDICATION Medication purchasing and maintenance will follow standard drug prescription and payment procedures of the BC Provincial Health Care Program and Medical Services Plan. This protocol involves prescriptions being handed to the Companion , family representativ e or Coworker by the physician; the Companion , family representative or Coworker then taking the prescription to a pharmacy of choice, the pharmacy filling the prescription and handing the completed order to the Companion , family representative or Coworker . Medication use is monitored by Coworker to support maintenance needs. The pharmacy will bill the Medical Services Plan through the Companion 's Care Card. In the event that the Care Card does not cover a drug, the Companion will be billed directly and mus t pay privately. P ROCEDURE FOR TRANSPORTATION & DELIVERY OF MEDICATION The Companion , family representative and/or Coworker and their pharmacy will manage transportation and delivery of medications. Planning will involve the coordination of pick up requests, standing orders, delivery protocols and emergency contact information. Planning and established protocols will be docume nted in Companion files and coordinated with the Companion 's pharmacy to ensure accurate oversight is demonstrated. 2 HSP15 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 MEDICATION STORAGE , PACKAGING , LABELING , HANDLING AND USE Medications are kept in a locked medicine/filing cabinet, or other secure location. Medications requiring refrigeration or protection from light are stored accordingly i.e. refrigeration unit that is secure and locked, medication stored in light proof filing/medicine cabinet or drawer that is secure and locked. The pharm acy and/or prescription container may provide additional information for the proper storage of medications. Narcotics and barbiturates will be stored in a secure and light free location i.e. locked medicine cabinet in staff office, which has a double bolt lock.

Wear latex gloves when applying topical ointments. Check the date and time, and compare the medications listed on the Medication Administrat ion Record (MAR) with the medications on the cards. Make sure you have the right medications for the right person! Once you're sure everything checks out, punch the pill(s) out of the blister pack next to the correct date (if a previous dosage has been mi ssed, just leave it in the blister pack). For topical ointments, follow the directions on the container. For all non -blister pack medications, check the expiration date before administering. Administer the pill(s) to the Companion in the method they most prefer or as direc ted by physician/pharmacist (with water, on a spoonful of applesauce, etc). Stay with the person until the medication is taken. After the medications are taken, or the ointment applied, initial the Medication Administration Record in the appropriate box. If the medication is refused or lost, record the appropriate code in the box (see upper left corner of MAR). MAR documents are considered legal reporting forms and must not be tampered with. If you make an error in recording, circle it a nd write on the reverse side what happened. Do not use liquid paper or try to change anything once it has been recorded. Medication dropped or lost should be replaced by using the medication from the last day of the month. Phone the pharmacist to order a replacement for the end of the month. Record the lost medication on the back of the MAR. 3 HSP16 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP16 SPOILED MEDICATION If medication is spoiled in any way: Dispense another dose of medication, where none of the original dosage was ingested. Return the original dosage to the pharmacy for disposal. Phone the pharmacy and order one replacement of the medication. Indicate on the MAR that o ne dose had been destroyed and replaced. Note: if the Companion does not reside at a Ita Wegman Association residence an identified and medication trained Coworker will inform and assist Companion and / or legal guardian of \"spoil\" and assist where applicable to ensure the pharmacy or origin is notified of the \"spoil\" and planning coordinated to return original dose for disposal and replacement if required. PRN MEDICATIONS - (\"as needed\") are to be recorded on the reverse side of the MAR. Documentation to include the need for PRN and any benefit or lack thereof effects to ensure quality of care and comprehensive reporting. Approved and trained Coworkers must: Sign the PRN out. Administer as needed. Return the medication to a storage location. Report to the House Coordinator / Program Director o r designate medication was administered. Document on the MAR sheet. Report the reason and or effects of the medication, record this in the Companion's notes. Follow standard incident debriefing procedure (when applicable). TIMING - NOTED ON THE MAR Timing for administering medication must be strictly followed. Coworkers will maintain a running record of the dates and times when medication is given to a Companion (this includes any refusals or missed medications). CHANGES TO DOSAGE Any and all change s to medication must be confirmed with the physician and pharmacy before being administered. No hand -written changes will be made on pharmacy labels. Any changes to medication will be documented on the MAR and in the Companion's medical notes. Changes of dosage by a physician will be recorded, dated, and signed on the MAR. R ECORDS 4 HSP16 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP16 Complete and current records are kept secure and safe in the Companion file. The written record MAR includes the name of medication, dosage, frequency, instructions for use, and the name of the doctor. Responsibility of: All Coworkers Monitored by: House Coordinators and Facility Manager HSP17 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP17 MEDICATION INCIDENTS POLICY The Ita Wegman Association does not prescribe or dispense medication; Coworkers only monitor and administer medications, this includes homeopathic medications. In this regard, Coworkers monitor those Companions who are able to manage their medications and treatments independently, and assist in the administration of medications and treatments for Companions who require ongoing assistance. The Ita Wegman Association adheres to all Adult Care Regulations regarding medication storage, monitoring, review, administration, records keeping and reporting, i.e. any errors or adverse reactions are reported promptly and are responded to appropriately. PROCEDURES M ISSED MEDICATION OR REFUSAL TO TAKE There may be occasions when a Companion may miss, lose or refuse their scheduled medication. In the event of any of these events the following will occur: Document the missed or lost medication on the MAR sheet. Contact the appropriate House Coordinator and inform them of the incident. A pro bable directive could result in the House Coordinator contacting the hospital, pharmacies, and/or Companion 's physician. House Coordinator to c omplete a critical incident report immediately and send it to the Facility Manager. PROCEDURE FOR MEDICATION INCIDENTS Coworkers should perform a visual check of the pertinent medication sheet that they are attending to. In the event there has been an error(s), follow the appropriate drug incident response. DEFINITION OF A MEDICATION INCIDENT Medication incidents are categorized as: 1. Unordered drugs given - any medication given to a person not prescribed for that person. 2. Wrong dosage - any dose above or below the correct dose. 3. Extra dose - any dose given in excess of the total number of times ordered by the physician. 4. Wrong time - any drug given (other than a refusal) more than (1) one hour before or after time ordered. 5. Omission - any dose not given by the time the next dose i s due. 2 HSP17 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP17 6. Wrong route of administration of medication. 7. Spoiled medication. 8. Failure to record administration of medication on medication sheet. 9. Incorrectly recording administration of medication on medication sheet. 10. Failure to comply with the medication po licy / procedures as determined by the House Manager or House Coordinator. 11. A Companion refusing to take their medication or having to destroy a tablet which has been contaminated (i.e. dropped on floor) is not considered a medication error. Similarly, items 7 and 8 may or may not be considered a medication error, depending on the circumstances. DRUG INCIDENT RESPONSE The Ita Wegman Association Critical Incident Policy requires that all accidents, injury, serious medication errors and critical incidents be reported immediately to the House Coordinator / Facility Manager. When a medication incident has occurred, this requires an immediate response. ALL Coworkers or House Coordinators will : A) Inform the Companion what has occurred, and the steps you are taking to rectify the situation. B) It is recommended the Coworker or House Coordinator contact one of the following: Dispensing pharmacist within twenty (20) minutes of the incident, or the family physician within twenty (20) minutes of the incident Contact family and/or a friend as specified in a Companion's support plan Contact the House Coordinator / Facility Manager Or the BC Poison Information Center - phone 604 -682-5050 Or, as a last resort, the emergency room at the hospital and act on their recommendation. C) Follow instructions given. D) Complete a critical incident report, citing how and why the incident occurred, steps taken, who was notified and at what time. Instructions from the pharmacist and/or physician will also be noted, as well as any other pertinent information. E) Record the physician or pharmacists' instructions in the event log. Responsibility of: All Coworkers Monitored by: House Coordinator & Facility Manager 1 HSP18 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP18 MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS POLICY The Ita Wegman Association ensures all medical needs and medication requirements are observed for every Companion. All Coworkers are provided training in the following medical orders given by physicians. When medication is prescribed by a physician for a C ompanion living within the residence, written instructions will be obtained from the prescribing physician and attending pharmacist as to the identification, potential side effects, means and schedule of administration of each medication prescribed as well as approval for use of over the counter medications. PROCEDURES OBSERVATION PURPOSE * Observation is essential to assist in making a diagnosis, or in keeping track of a Companion 's progress. It gives purpose and direction to the Companion 's support . It aids others (doctors, therapists, social workers) in their work with a Companion and their family. DEVELOPING OBSERVATION SKILLS * Skill and judgment in observing develop with pract ice, patience and the will to improve, the same as with any other skill. There are five resources to be used when observing Companions : Looking - take particular note to detect any changes in a Companion's usual facial expressions, skin, body posture . Plea se note Companion's immediate surroundings (i.e. ventilation, temperature, nourishment) and their condition (i.e. if the diet was consumed or not). Listening - is the most important half of a conversation. Purposeful listening during conversation is a mean s for gaining such information as coherence, disorientation, worries, fears, needs and interests of the Companion . Smelling - Unusual odours are an index to circumstances and they capture the attention of an alert Coworker . For example, the observation of a sweet odour on a Companion 's breath might be a valuable aid to the physician. Talking - it is important to show the Companion genuine acceptance. Keep in mind that how something is said or asked (tone of voice, language used, facial expressions, attentio n, etc.) makes a difference in the way a Companion responds. 2 HSP18 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP18 Touching or Feeling - Taking the pulse is a good example of observing through touch. Placing the hand on the brow detects fever or perspiration. During both, the sense of touch may locate abnormalities of the skin or scalp. The Coworker has many opportunities to observe ; the challenge comes in continued motivation to develop these abilities within your knowledge and responsibilities. The role is one of supplying accurate, specific information to the physician and professionals. It is a vital role. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS * A SIGN is an indicator or a fact that points out evidence of something. These indicators are things that can be seen, heard, felt, smelled, etc. (i.e.. taking temperature). A SYMPTOM is evidence that a Companion shares or tells, such as nausea, headache , chills, fever, fatigue, dizziness, fear. GUIDELINES IN RECORDING OBSERVATIONS * The following are not necessarily numbered in order of importance, nor would all nine points apply to each recording. However, the time something was observed must accompany the remarks. The nature of what is recorded is determined by what is important for the physician or professional to know. Time/when observed. Location of abnormal sensation (exactness in so far as possible). Duration (how long it lasted, i.e. chill). Frequency/intensity (pain was constant or intermittent, severe, mild throbbing, etc.). Relief obtained from nursing measures (whether or not they seemed to help). General appearance of the Companion (if this has change d). Amount, colour, character of discharge (urine, feces, vomit, sputum, drainage). Exact words of the individual, when indicated. Complaints (as to eating, sleeping, pain, etc.). TAKING TEMPERATURE PURPOSE - To determine the temperature of the body heat as an observation. EQUIPMENT - Thermometer, tissues or cotton swabs, lubricant (water -soluble), paper, pen, a watch with a second hand, and latex gloves. 3 HSP18 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP18 COURSE OF ACTION - The Ita Wegman Association only uses electric thermometers, thermometers are to be used according to the instructions included by the manufacturer. ORAL TEMPERATURE Wash hands before and after the procedure. Ensure the Companion is in a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Place the correct end of the thermometer under the Companion 's tongue. Ask the Companion to keep their lips closed and see that they do not talk, bite or remove the thermometer. Leave the thermometer in place until the thermometer beeps . Read the temperature on the thermom eter. Place the thermometer in an antiseptic solution. Record the reading in the Companion database. INFRARED NO-TOUCH TEMPERATURE Wash hands before and after the procedure. Ensure the Companion is in a comfortable position. Turn on the thermometer. Ensure that it is set to 'body', not 'surface'. Take the temperature. Read the temperature on the thermometer. Record the reading in the Companion database. NORMAL TEMPERATURE RANGE The normal range for temperature is 96.8F (36.0C) to 99.5 F (37.5C) if taken orally, or by infrared no-touch thermometer. Temperature will vary from one Companion to another and will fluctuate throughout the day. EAR DROPS It is r ecommended that support be provided to avoid contamination or infection. Wash hands before and after the procedure . Avoid touching the dropper against the affected ear or any other surface. Hold the container in your hand for a few minutes to warm to near body temperature. DO NOT HEAT IN BOILING WATER. If the drops are in suspension form, shake well for ten seconds before using. Have the Companion lie on their side or tilt the affected ear up for ease of administratio n. 4 HSP18 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP18 To allow drops to run in: Adults - Hold the earlobe up and back Children - Hold the earlobe down and back DO NOT insert the dropper into the ear. DO NOT wash droppers to avoid getting water in the drops. Maintain the ear tilted for about two (2) seconds, or insert a soft cotton plug, whichever is recommended. If the condition persists or becomes worse, or if the Companion experiences any itching or burning in the ear for more than a few minutes after use, contact the physician. REMEMBER: Keep the container tightly closed when not in use. DO NOT refrigerate, unless instructed to do so by the physician or pharmacist. NOSE DROPS It is recommended that support be provided to avoid contamination or infection. Wash hands before and after the procedure . Wear gloves. Have Companion lie on back without a pillow, head turned to the side and slightly back. Draw medication into a dropper. Instill prescribed numbers of drops into each nostril. Ask the Companion to keep their head back for five minutes. NASAL SPRAY It is recommended that support be provided to avoid contamination or infection. Wash hands before and after the procedure. Close the nostril that is not receiving the medication. Do this by gently pressing on that side of the Companion's nose. Gently inse rt the bottle tip into the other nostril. Ask Companion to breathe in deeply through that nostril as you squeeze the bottle. Repeat if directed. EYE DROPS AND OINTMENT It is recommended that support be provided to avoid contamination or infection. Wash hands before and after the procedure . Wear gloves. The tip of the eye dropper, squeeze bottle or ointment tube must not come in contact with the hands, the eyelid or the o utside of the cap. If contamination should occur, medication should be discarded. 5 HSP18 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP18 Position Companion lying with head tilted backward or sitting in a chair with head tilted backward. Cleanse eyelid and lashes from the inner corner to outer corner with moist ened cotton swab - avoid pressure on the eye. Draw medication into the dropper. With the forefinger of one hand, press against the bony orbit of the eye and gently pull down on the tissue below the lower lid, forming a small pocket with the lower lid. The medication container is held to the side of the face but it is never closer than one inch from the body. Allow drop(s) to go into the eye pocket between lower lid and eyeball; release eyelid. Keep the eye closed for one minute, use a cotton swab to wipe the eye. In instilling an eye ointment, the sam e procedure is followed. On applying the ointment, squeeze a small ribbon of medication along the inside of the lower lid. With either ointment or drops, the Companion should be advised not to rub the eyes but to blot any excess medication with a clean tis sue or cloth. RECTAL ADMINISTRATION OF SOLID MEDICATION PURPOSE - Specific to a Companion 's condition. To ensure medication is received when other methods are not feasible. EQUIPMENT : Gloves Lubricant Tissue wipes or gauze square Prescribed medication APPLICATION : Wash hands before and after the procedure . Allow Companion as much privacy as possible by covering with a sheet, and exposing only the anal region. Turn Companion on the left side with the right knee at a right angle. Put on a glove and remove the wrapper from the suppository . Lubricate your index finger. Insert suppository gently, point first, into rectum past the internal anal sphincter muscle approximately two and one -half to three inches into the rectum or one finger length. Ask Companion to breathe through the mouth as su ppository is inserted; remove finger. Apply pressure over the anus; hold buttocks together for a short time. 6 June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP18 Instruct Companion about retaining the suppository; hold for at least 15 to 20 minutes. If possible, for the purpose of defecation, hold until abso rption is completed, according to the purpose of the drug and effect desired. Leave the Companion warm and comfortable. Record. Report and observe as necessary. CONDITION OF EPILEPSY Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by disturbances of consciousness generally resulting in seizures. A seizure is a state produced by abnormally excessive discharges within the central nervous system. TREATMENT OF EPILEPSY Seizure disorders are dealt with in several ways. Two of these treatment methods include either emphasis on regularity with respect to diet, activity, rest and exercise, or administration of drugs of various types and combinations. Treatment by drug admini stration is a common form of control. The objective when dealing with drugs is to obtain the ideal dosage level that will control the seizure but will not interfere with the Companion 's daily life. People who have the condition of epilepsy should adhere t o regular meals, sleep and exercise as a precautionary measure in preventing the onset of seizures. CARE FOR A COMPANION DURING A SEIZURE When a Companion has a seizure it is important to remain calm. A seizure may appear harmful but the Companion is not i n pain, and will probably not suffer any damage resulting from the seizure itself. You cannot stop a seizure once it has begun. Simply let the seizure run its course. If the Companion is seated, try to gently pull them onto a flat surface so they do not fa ll. Do not restrain a Companion 's movements. Rigid restriction may result in broken bones as the muscular movements during the seizure are very strong. Clear the area of all objects that might harm a Companion , but try not to interfere with the movements a Companion is making. Place something soft under the head to ensure a slight incline. In many cases, simply placing your hands under the Companion 's head to act as a cushion is the easiest and most effective way to prevent head banging or injury. Turn the Companion on their side in order to aid breathing, if it can be accomplished without interfering with the Companion 's movements. Saliva or vomit can flow more freely from the mouth in this position. If the seizure is intense, simply guiding the head to th e side might be an easier procedure than attempting to reposition the Companion 's whole body. 7 HSP18 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP18 Loosen all tight clothing and try to keep the head and neck extended, not flexed, as this also helps with breathing. Do not give the Companion anything to drink during a seizure or put anything in the Companion 's mouth , unless directed by individual Seizure Protocol. Stay with the Companion until all movements have ceased and stand by until the Companion has fully regained consciousness. The Companion will probably be confused upon regaining consciousness and will need to be reoriented to their surroundings. After a seizure, the Companion may feel very tired and wish to rest. When the Companion feels bett er they may wish to proceed with regular activities. If the seizure lasts more than eight (8) minutes, or if the seizure is repeated without consciousness being regained, call 911 immediately . A common occurrence for people who have experienced a seizure i s feeling embarrassed upon regaining consciousness, especially if the Companion has become incontinent. The less people around or watching the Companion the better it will be for the individual once the seizure is over. RECOGNIZING AND RECORDING SEIZURE AC TIVITY The following information will assist you to recognize and record seizure activities accurately. The information observed and recorded will greatly assist the Companion 's physician to understand the particular seizure activity which is occurring. It is important to keep in mind that all Companion's experience seizures differently. Seizure symptoms can range from mild (appearance of being 'spaced out', eye flickering, shuffling,) to severe. House Coordinators, or Workshop Leaders will inform Coworkers regarding the warning signs, and seizure signs specific to the Companion. Record the time the seizures occur, duration and your observations. AURA - This is a warning that some people experience or display immediately before a seizure begins. A common occurrence is the Companion may cry out or reach for support. COLOUR CHANGES - The Companion may appear white (pallor) or blue (cyanosis). FALL - Not all seizures are associated with a fall or loss of posture. If a Companion does fall, it is important to know whether the Companion gradually slumped to the ground (atonic), or experienced an abrupt, violent and forceful fall to the ground (akinetic). AKINETIC SEIZURES - are those which commonly cause bodily injury. People who are prone to frequently experience this type of seizure activity may decide to wear protective headgear for their health and safety. 8 HSP18 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed February 2023 HSP18 TONIC SPASM - Identified with a sustained contracture of the limbs so they appear rigid. If the back and neck are involved, they will become arched and extended. Teeth and jaw may be clenched tightly. Usually accompanied by cyanosis. A Companion may become incontinen t. Generally, confusion and sleepiness are experienced following such seizure activity. Duration is approximately 1 - 3 minutes, however it may be longer. HYPNOTIC - Some seizures are associated with a loss of muscle tone and the Companion experiencing thi s type of seizure activity appears floppy like a rag doll. Such seizure activity usually renders a Companion motionless but occasional jerking movements may be present. UNCONSCIOUS - An unconscious Companion will not respond to pain (i.e. pinching) or verb al stimuli. FOCAL MOTOR - It is important to describe the part of the body involved in a focal seizure. Commonly, it will involve one full or partial side of the body. (i.e. face only - arm only). The activity may shift from side to side. Also, it may only be a sensation such as a tingling in one area of the body, or a jerking of a limb, or may have visual or auditory or olfactory (smell) phenomena associated with it. Duration is approximately 2 - 10 seconds but may be longer. MYOCLONIC JERKS - Momentary sp lit-second flexion movements of the arms and/or head and legs occurring once or in a series of jerking movements. It is important to observe the total number of jerks and the total duration of the seizure. ABSENCE ATTACKS - Characterized by a transient lac k of attention without loss of consciousness or brief loss of consciousness. There may be slight twitching, eyes blinking , slight muscle movement may be seen around the mouth, or kicking or shuffling of feet, drooling, etc. May resume activity immediately. Duration 2 - 10 seconds. PSYCHOMOTOR - Varies widely. Often has loss of awareness of surroundings, inappropriate actions (i.e. picking at clothes, chewing movements), walking to and fro and the Companion may appear disoriented. If you observe a behaviour pattern that is repetitive, you should describe it in the best possible manner. Duration may be 2 -4 minutes and occasionally longer.

PROCEDURE REGULAR MEDICATION Medications generally administered in the home s of The Ita Wegman Association may accompany a Companion off-site; i.e. programming, on holiday, family visit or other planned absence. To ensure Companion safety and in accordance with Adult Care Regulations guidelines, the following occurs: Off site request is made to the House Coordinator associated with the Companion . House Coordinator approves medication removal. Medication is prepared, and stored in a secure traveling package (note: Ingram Pharmacy has approved sending medication in the original blister packs, along with a note including storage tips). If absent Companion is accompanied by a Coworker: A MAR sheet is prepared and included in the traveling package. For parents a nd family: the MAR sheet can stay in the Ita Wegman Association residence, the House Coordinator will mark it with a \"4\", then write the situation on the back of the MAR sheet (i.e. \"Chris was at home with mom from July 23 - 26\"). Traveling packages are the n given to approved/assigned Coworker or parents of the Companion . Upon return the medication package is returned to the House Coordinator. The MAR sheet is reviewed by the House Coordinator to assure compliance with procedure and a check for any incidents or irregularities. Any incidents are recorded in an incident report following standard procedure. PRN medication (PRN HSP20 PRN medication administered in the homes of The Ita Wegman Association are administered by trained Coworker s.

PROCEDURES Industrial Health and Safety Regulations (WCB) and the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) legislation states that hazardous materials and substances within a worksite must be identified and measures taken to eliminate or effectively c ontrol the dangers related to their transportation, storage, handling, use and disposal. It is the responsibility of every C oworker to store and handle hazardous materials and substances in a safe manner. Hazardous is defined as those products that come with a hazardous symbol on the label, and are reflected in the following classes: 1. CLASS A: COMPRESSED GAS This class includes compressed gases, dissolved gases and gases liquefied by compression or refrigeration. Examples: gas cylinders for oxyacetylene welding or water disinfectants . 2. CLASS B: FLAMMABLE AND COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL This class includes solids , liquids and gases capable of catching fire or exploding in the presence of a source of ignition. Examples: white phosphorus, acetone and butane. Flammable liquids such as acetone are more easily ignited than combustible liquids such as kerosene. 3. CLASS C: OXIDIZING MATERIAL Materials which provide oxygen or similar substances and which increase the risk of fire if they come in contact with flammable or combustible materials. Examples: sodium hypochlorite, perchloric acid, inorganic peroxides. 4. CLASS D: POISONOUS AND INFECTIOUS MATERIALS DIVISION 1 -Materials causing immediate and serious toxic effects. This division covers materials, which can cause the death of a person exposed to small amounts. Examples: sodium cyanide, hydrogen sulphide. 2 HSP24 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP24 DIVISION 2 - Materials causing other toxic effects. This division covers materials whichcause immediate skin or eye irritation as well as those which can cause long term effects in a person repeatedly exposed to small amounts. Examples: acetone (irritant), asbestos (cancer causing), toluene diisocyanate ( a sensitizing agent). DIVISION 3 - Biohazardous infectious material. This division applies to materials, which contain harmful microorganisms . Examples: cultures or diagnostic specimens containing salmonella bacteria or the hepatitis B virus. 5. CLASS 5: CORROSIVE MATERIAL Caustic or acid materials that can destroy the skin or eat through metals. Examples: muriatic acid, lye. 6. CLASS 6: DANGEROUSLY REACTIVE MATERIAL Products, which can undergo dangerous reactions if subjected to heat, pressure, shock or allowed to contact water.

Many workers may find some of the information on MSDS difficult to understand. The identified Health and Safety Committee must ensure every C oworker understands the information in order for him or her to work safely wit h or near controlled products. 7. CLASS 7: BIOHAZARD MATERIAL To safeguard all C oworker's and C ompanion's health, this occurrence demands immediate attention. To this end, there is a \"Biohazard response\" kit located with the first aid kit in each residen ce. In the kit you will find: 1) An Instruction sheet with the cleaning protocol 2) Hand Towelettes 3) Face Mask, Surgical with shield 4) Disposable Gloves 5) Waste Bags and Twist Ties 6) Biohazard Pick Up Scoop/Scraper 7) Surface Disinfectant 8) Paper Towel 9) Infectious Waste /Biohazard Disposal Tag 10) General Household Cleaner Avoid direct contact with body fluids, as they all have the potential to spread germs. Germs in vomit and diarrhea may travel through the air, so it is very important to clean it up quickly. The following is the recommended procedure to use: Take the kit to the site of the biohazard event 1. Put on gloves and an apron . (Masks and goggles and protective sleeves are in kit if you wish to use). 2. Remove all the visible material, working from the least to the most soiled areas, using a paper towel supp lied. If you are cleaning up feces or vomit, be careful not to agitate the material, so that virus particles do not become airborne. Put all material in a garbage bag for disposal. 4 HSP24 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP24 3. Clean the area using General Household Cleaner and paper towels, again work ing from the least to the most soiled areas. Put all soiled paper towels same garbage bag as step #2 for disposal. 4. Sanitize the area us ing a sanitizer solution. The sanitizer must contact the affected area for a minimum of 10 minutes. (5 minutes if on carp et) 5. Place any Soiled linens in a second garbage bag, a) Seal with twist tie b) Label with supplied label (blood, vomit, feces, urine) Items grossly contaminated with blood are disposed of - not laundered - please label as such c) If event occurs in a residence - take to t he associated laundry room d) If event occurs in Admin areas - take to closest laundry room 6. Spray goggles with sanitizing solution - wipe dry 7. Discard gloves and other disposable articles in same garbage bag as step #2 for disposal. Dispose of liquid wastes in the toilet or down the utility sink drain - DO NOT FLUSH PAPER TOWEL 8. Wash your hands after removing the gloves. 9. Report the even t to the Facility Manager.

Responsibility of: All Coworkers Monitored by: Facility Manager 1 HSP25 Created: J uly 2021 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP25 AUTHORIZATION COMPANION REMOVAL POLICY The Ita Wegman Association will ensure no Companion is permitted to leave or be removed from a residence or program facility with a person who is not authorized or deemed capable to take the Companion off property. PURPOSE To ensure all Companions are saf e and secure at all times . PROCEDURE Any individual wanting to remove a Companion from a residence or program facility must first have authorization from the Companion's immediate family member(s) / legal guardian(s) or the Companion themselves. Authoriz ation must be confirmed in advance with specific information i.e. contact information, duration of time off site, where Companion is being taken, when Companion will be returning, activities Companion will be involved in etc. Ultimately, no Companion will be released to any person(s) without authorization. The Ita Wegman Association reserves the right to request additional information or approval if there is a concern of Companion safety based on the release. Coworkers will consult with the Facility M anager if the individual wishing to remove the Companion is deemed incapable. Responsibility of : all Coworker Monitored by: House Coordinator, Facility Manager, Workshop Leader Created: 2017 Revi ewed : Febr uary HSP26 CELL PHONE USE POLICY The Ita Wegman Association recognizes cell phones are considered an essential communication tool and to that end, The Ita Wegman Association permits C oworkers to utilize their cell phones as long as the use does not impede work to be completed. It is expected that while at work, duties will come first and cell phone use will be restricted to emergency calls / texts or work related needs. If at any point in time there is a suspicion or actual incident where work is not being completed due to excessive use, corrective action will be taken. For instances where a C ompanion of T he Ita Wegman Association is being transported in a vehicle , it is expected that all Coworkers understand and ensure that at no time is the use of a cellular phone while driving with a C ompanion in the care of the Ita Wegman Association permitted. This includes making or answering calls. DO NOT USE A MOBILE DEVICE WHEN DRIVING. PULL OVER TO MAKE OR RECEIVE A CALL If you must make or receive a call while in your car, pull over to the side of the road as soon as it is safe to do so. Make sure you're safely off the side of the road so you're not posing a danger to other vehicles. Hands -free does not mean risk -free. Ho wever, a hands -free unit allows you to keep both hands on the wheel while you talk on the phone. Attach the microphone to the visor just above your line of vision, so you can keep your eyes on the road. NEVER DIAL WHILE DRIVING If you must dial manually, d o so only when stopped. Pull off the road when it is safe to do so. DON 'T TAKE NOTES WHILE DRIVING If you need to write something down, pull off to the side of the road.

Slip, Trip and Fall Protection is an integral part of our commitment to a safe work and home environment. Slip, Trip and Fall Protection shall be achieved through the use of controls that will involve all Coworkers and Companions. The use of controls include: Identification of hazards that contribute to slips, trips and falls Taking responsible precautions to prevent slip, trip and fall hazards when identified Educating all Coworkers and Companions on measures that will reduce slips, trips and falls Elimination of hazards through identification, addressing i.e. engineering (design) and implementing protocols to address identified hazards. DEFINITIONS Slip A slide causing an individual to lose their balance. This can either be corrected or cause the individual to fall. Slips happen when there is too little friction or traction between the footwear and the walking surface. Common causes of slips are: Wet or oily surfaces Occasional spills Weather hazards Loose, unanchored rugs or mats Flooring or other walking surfaces that do not have the same degree of traction in all areas Trip A stumble, often over an obstacle, causing an individual to lose their balance. This can either be corrected or cause the individual to fall. Trips happen when the foot strikes or hits an object.

Standard/universal precautions are intended to stop the spread of germs to others. It is not always apparent if a person is infected with AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or any number of other diseases. Standard/universal precautions will be followed at all times to ensure the prevention of the risk of further infection to others. Equipment and supplies required for appropriate precautionary preventio n and response will be kept updated, inventoried, stored appropriately and accessible. Blood and body fluids need to be treated as potentially infectious. Body fluids include blood, semen, urine, feces, nasal secretions, saliva, vomit, and vaginal secretio ns. PROCEDURE 1. Coworkers and Companions will implement standard/universal precautions at all times when contact is made with another person's bodily fluids. With respect to COVID- 19 Pandemic, Coworkers and Companions will abide by the COVID- 19 Prevention Policy. 2. When a person's health is potentially compromised due to contact with another person's bodily fluids, a Critical Incident Report must be completed and a WorkSafe BC report filed, as necessary. 3. Coworkers and Companions will have access to training, orientation and/or resources about the transmission and prevention of disease and illness. 4. All sites are cleaned regularly to prevent the spread of illness and disease. 5. All residences and worksites will be provided the necessary supplies to meet standard/universal precaution standards. These more common infections and illnesses are responsible for the majority of illness and they fall into four broad categories: RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS such as colds and flu are responsible for the greatest number of illnesses. Most colds exhibit themselves as fever, runny nose, coughing and sneezing. Many lead to ear infections or lower respiratory infections. These infections are generally spread fro m the mouth and nose or through droplets coughed or sneezed into the air. 2 HSP30 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP30 Coworkers and Companions showing symptoms of illness, are required to wear a mask or isolate at home until free of symptoms. SAFEGUARDING DURING OUTBREAKS: The Ita Wegman Association maintains no mandatory immunizations; however, there is a responsibility to safeguard the health of Companions and Coworkers. All Coworkers and Companions are required to wear a mask at their workplace and home place, until the outbreak is over. Exceptions exist for persons who, for medical reasons, cannot wear a mask. For individuals who are medically unable to wear a mask, additional safeguards will be put in place. INTESTINAL INFECTIONS cause diarrhoea such as viral enteritis , Giardia, Shigella, Salmonella, and Hepatitis A. In these cases, infections are transmitted from person to person directly from the bowel movement to the mouth, usually by way of the hands or indirectly by food or other objects, which go into the mouth. SKIN INFECTIONS and infestations such as impetigo, lice, scabies or ringworm are generally transmitted through direct contact. Some bacteria such as Staphylococcus spread easily through direct contact and from contaminated articles to broken skin surfaces . Viruses such as the Herpes Simplex (which causes cold sores) spread readily from moist lesions. VIRAL INFECTIONS such as chickenpox, measles, roseola, mumps and mononucleosis are mainly transmitted through and nasal secretions. The basics of stand ard/universal precautions: Blood and body fluids - always treat as potentially infectious. Clean first with water to wipe away dirt, soils and other debris. Plain dish soap or any kind of household cleaning product will remove dirt, oils and other debris f rom surfaces. Secondly, disinfect with store -bought disinfectant. If not available, household bleach can be mixed with room temperature water (do not use hot water) in specific ratios to disinfect areas (please see table below for ratios1). Ensure that the re is a Drug Identification Number (DIN), which is an 8 -digit number given by Health Canada confirming it is approved for use in Canada. 3 HSP30 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP30 Gloves - wear latex, vinyl, or rubber disposable gloves when handling blood, body fluids, or when cleaning cuts, sc rapes, or wounds. Gloves should be in your first aid kit so they are always ready. Method of wearing Gloves: i. Perform hand hygiene before putting gloves on ii. To remove gloves safely, with one of your gloved hands pull off your glove for the opposite hand f rom the fingertips, as you are pulling, form your glove into a 4 HSP30 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP30 ball within the palm of your gloved hand. To remove your other glove, slide your ungloved hand in under the glove at the wrist and gently roll inside out, and away from your body. Avoid touching the outside of the gloves with your bare hands. (see Appendix 7 for instructions). iii. Gloves must be changed and hand hygiene performed when they are torn. iv. Discard the gloves in a plastic -lined waste container. v. Perform hand hygiene after removing gloves. Sharp Objects - place needles and syringes in a safe container. Never re -cap, bend or break off used needles. Sharps collector containers are provided a t some Society sites. If a sharps container is not available, place them in a sealed puncture -proof metal or plastic container with a lid, such as an empty coffee tin and then place in the garbage. Personal Articles - never share toothbrushes or razors. They can transmit small amounts of blood from one user to the next. Dispose of razors carefully. Wrap sanitary napkins before disposing. Handle bloody bedding or clothing cautiously, and wash in hot soapy water. Contaminated Objects and Surfaces - Surfa ces visibly soiled with blood, body fluids or excrement should be cleaned immediately. Wipe up blood or other body fluids with a disposable cloth and discard it appropriately (instructions in the next paragraph). Soiled surfaces should be disinfected tho roughly after cleaning. Clean the area using a solution that is approved for biohazard remediation. This solution should be freshly made up or it may lose its strength. Following a blood spill, allow this solution to sit on the contaminated surface for 10 minutes, then wipe clean and discard the cloth. Soak mops or brushes used for cleaning in the solution for 20 minutes. Linen and Clothing - Linen and clothing that has been contaminated with blood or body fluids should be handled as little as possible. These articles should be transported directly to the washing machine and laundered in hot soapy water. Dishes and Cutlery - Wash all dishes in an automatic dishwasher or use a three step dishwashing technique, which includes a final sanitizing stage. Other Precautions - Coworkers (and Companions receiving support) should avoid exposure of open skin lesions or mucous membranes to blood or body fluids. Companions who 5 HSP30 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP30 exhibit aggressive behaviour (biting, scratching, etc.) may require special precautions. Consult a nurse or other health care practitioner. Quarantine - At any point, if there is a need to evacuate or quarantine a program or facility based on Coworker or Companion illness. All Coworkers will adhere to the Ministry of Health Licencing quarantine protocols. In this regard, the Ita Wegman Association will work with Ministry of Health officials to ensure the safety and well being of all C ompanions and Coworkers. Hand washing is the best single way to prevent the spread of germs from one person to another. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 15 -20 seconds. When to Wash Your Hands: Before preparing, handling, serving or eating food After personal body functions Before and after breastfeeding Before putting on any PPE including gown, gloves, facial or eye protection After taking off any PPE Before and after engaging in group activities Before contact with a participant or their environment Before and after first aid After contact with bodily fluids After contact with participant and/or their environment After disposing of garbage or dirty laundry Whenever hands look dirty Proper Ha nd Washing Method: 1. Wet your hands 2. Apply plain soap (antibacterial soap not necessary, as COVID -19 is a virus and not bacteria) 3. Rub hands together for 20 seconds (the length of time it takes to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star or Happy Birthd ay) June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP30 4. Wash the front and back of your hands, as well as between your fingers and under your nails 5. Rinse your hands well for 10 seconds under warm running water, using a rubbing motion 6. Wipe and dry your hands gently with a paper town or a clean towel (drying them vigorously can damage the skin) 7. Turn off tap using the paper towel so that you do not re -contaminate your hands (when using a public bathroom, use the same paper towel to open the door when you leave) 8. If skin dryness is a probl em, use a moisturizing lotion Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw tissues away immediately, then wash or sanitize your hands. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into the bend of your elbow, or into your upper a rm or sleeve (not your hands). Teach others - particularly children about healthy behaviour and potential risks and how to deal with them safely. Please Note: BC Centre for Disease Control (2020). Taken from http://www.bccdc.ca/health- info/diseases -conditions/covid- 19/prevention -risks/cleaning -and-disinfecting How can you safely clean up spills of blood or other body fluids? Protect yourself by wearing disposable vinyl or latex or rubber gloves. If there is a risk of splashing use protective eye wear. Use disposable absorbent material such as paper towels to remove most of the spill. Place these in a plastic bag and deposit in the municipal garbage disposal unit, not in the regular facility garbage receptacle, where others come in contact with it. Wipe the floor, or any contaminated surfaces with a disinfectant solution. This can be easily made by mixing one part household bleach to ten parts of water. This type of bleach solution should be freshly made up or it may lose its strength. For carpets or upholstery that may be damaged by bleach, other household germicides or disinfectant agents can be used. Soak mops or brushes that have been used for cleaning in a disinfectant for 20 minutes. When you are finished wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and make sure mops, brushes and pails have been thoroughly rinsed to avoid a mix of chemicals What should you do if y ou find a used syringe or condom? 7 HSP30 Created: June 2023 HSP30 NEVER touch needles, syringes or condoms. It is important to help everyone understand how important these necessary precautions are. If you find a used syringe or condom - especially in a park, school or playground - it is important to inform the proper authorities or, if able, dispose of them promptly and carefully. It is best to limit risks as much as possible. Use a pair of tongs or pliers, or a pair of sturdy gloves to pick up these items. Discard condoms in a plast ic bag. Discard syringes or needles in a puncture -proof container, preferably one intended for such purposes. Preferably a Sharps collector container, or plastic or metal container with a lid. When you have finished wash your hands carefully with soap and water. What should you do if you accidentally prick yourself with a dirty needle? If possible, put the pricked area low to the ground to promote bleeding. Wash the area well with soap and water. Go to the nearest local health unit or hospital emergency de partment immediately for treatment and/or assessment. REMEMBER - ALL BLOOD AND BODY FLUIDS ARE POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS. 8 HSP30 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP30 The international biological hazard symbol A biological hazard or biohazard is a biological substance that poses a threat to (primarily) human health. This can include medical waste, samples of a microorganism, virus or toxin (from a biological source) that can impact human health. It can also include substances harmful to animals. The term and its associated symbol is generally used as a warning, so that those potentially exposed to the substances will know to take precautions. T here is also a biohazard HCS/ WHMIS logo which utilizes the same symbol . Biohazardous agents are classified for transportation by UN number : UN 2814 (Infectious substance to Humans) UN 2900 (Infectious substance to Animals) UN 3291 (Medic al Waste) Levels of biohazard Level 1 being minimum risk and Level 4 being extreme risk. 9 HSP30 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP30 Biohazard Level 1: Several kinds of bacteria including Bacillus subtilis , canine hepatitis , E. coli, varicella ( chicken pox ), as well as some cell cultures and non -infectious bacteria. At this level precautions against the bio hazardous materials in question are minimal, most likely involving gloves and some sort of facial protection. Usually, contaminated materials are left in open (but separately indicated) trash receptacles. Decontamination procedures for this level are similar in most respects to modern precautions against everyday viruses (i.e.: washing one's hands with anti -bacterial soap, washing all exposed surfaces of the lab with disinfectants, etc). In a lab environment, all materials used for cell and/or bacteria c ultures are decontaminated via autoclave . Biohazard Level 2: Hepatitis B , hepatitis , Lyme disease virus , tuberculosis , typhus , Yellow fever Biohazard , and other various hemorrhagic diseases (mostly of African descent). When dealing with biological hazards at this level the use of a Hazmat suit and a self -contained oxygen supply is mandatory. The entrance and exit of a level four biolab will contain multiple showers, a vacuum room, an ultraviolet light room, and other safety precautions designed to destroy all traces of the biohazard. Multiple airlocks are employed and are electronically secured to prevent both doors opening at the same time. All air and water service going to and coming from a level 4 bio -lab will undergo similar decontamination procedures to eliminate the possibility of an accidental release. Hepatitis B In the case of Hepatitis B, signs of illness may be tiredness, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, tenderness in the upper right side of the stomach area, dark coloured urine, clay coloured stools and a yellowing of the skin and eyeballs. Sneezing, coughing, hugging or using the same dishes or cutlery does not spread Hep B. Where the Ita Wegman Association is aware of an infectious Individual, a vaccine will be offered as a prevent ative measure to all persons who may be in close contact with the infected Individual and thus at risk of contracting the disease. \"Aware \" is defined as conclusive evidence, as determined by a blood test ordered by the Individual's physician, and brought to the attention of the Facility Manager. When knowledge of the presence of Hep B is the result of a self- disclosure or a disclosure is made for or on behalf of the 10 HSP30 Created: June 2017 Revi ewed: February 2023 HSP30 Individual, a Coworker will notify the Facility Manager immediately. Furthermore, it is e xpected that new Individuals to the Ita Wegman Association will openly provide a comprehensive medical history prior to entering support. The approval for reimbursement of vaccines will only be made upon prior written approval of the Business Administrat or and in keeping with the above policy. If an Individual was accidentally exposed to the disease, without having been vaccinated prior to exposure, an Immunoglobulin shot is to be given within 24 hours (followed by the 3 shots regimen). While Hep B is a \"Reportable Disease\", meaning by law all sources must report Individuals known to have the disease to the local health authorities, this policy shall be carried out with the maximum respect possible pertaining to the privacy and dignity of the Individua l.

The snow removal team are as follows: * Heavy machinery operators for driveways - Maintenance, farm/garden Coworkers * Shoveling around residences - Coworkers * Shoveling / sanding pathways - Coworkers and Maintenance Responsibility of: All Coworkers Monitored by: Facility Manager 1 HSP47 Cr eated: June 2 01 7 Re vi ewed: Febr uar y 2 02 3 H SP47 BED BUGS POLICY The Ita Wegman Association makes every effort to ensure residential, program and office areas providing support maintain a bed bug free environment. As such, when bed bugs are discovered protocols are immediately implemented to remove the threat and ensure all Coworkers and Companions are safe and free from the spread of bed bugs. BED BUG CHARACTERISTICS Adults are 5 -6 mm unfed (1/4 inch) and up to 10 mm when engorged (3/8 inch or so). Immature insects can range from 1mm to 4 mm (about 1/16\" - 1/4\"). The y take about a month to mature. Adult is reddish- brown in color and wingless. Head is distinct from the abdomen, unlike roaches (see below). Can live for up to 6 months at 22\u00b0 C without feeding. Tend to feed every 5 -10 days. Are nocturnal and tend t o shy from light. Are considered \"hitchhikers\" hiding in personal belongings (i.e. pillows, clothing, luggage, bags etc.) and carried from one area to another. Are resistant to many pest -control chemicals. REQUIRED ACTIONS IF BED BUGS SUSPECTED OR FOUND Companion does not require isolation, however Coworkers should wear protection gear such as gloves until bed bugs are contained. Mattresses will be sealed in an approved bed bug mattress envelope Confine the Companion to one area, preferably an area with no fabric furniture or carpet. Spray bed bugs with rubbing alcohol. This kills them on the spot. Use the rubbing alcohol and a dish brush to kill the visible eggs, and then call an exterminator. Avoid putting Companions potentially infested with bed bugs i n common areas or cohorting with other Companions until bed bugs are contained. Have the Companion shower and change into clean clothing. If the Companion is unable to shower, please provide an alternate choice for bathing and any 2 HSP47 Cr eated: June 2 01 7 Re vi ewed: Febr uar y 2 02 3 H SP47 support required and as k the Companion to examine their body for bed bug bites. Document bites. Immediately DOUBLE BAG ALL Companion belongings (i.e. clothing, underwear, shoes, bags, etc.) in belongings bags and SEAL the bags with tape or tie the bags tightly. If the Companion uses a mobility device such as a cane or crutches, these items must also be checked, cleaned and cleared for use. Companion valuables (i.e. wallet, pocketbook etc.) should be placed in separate DOUBLE BAGS , also SEAL the bags with tape or tie the bags tightly. Remove contaminated items and keep Companion valuables with other Companion belongings in their room or a secure location within the home that is locked. Remove and DOUBLE BAG ALL potentially contaminated linen (i.e. disposable liners, sheets, blankets etc.) do not throw the linen on the floor, immediately put linen in linen bags and SEAL the bags with tape or tie the bags tightly. Launder (120\u00b0F/48. 8\u00baC minimum) affected items. Smaller items that cannot be laundered can sometimes be de -infested by heating. Individual items, for example, can be wrapped in plastic and placed in a hot, sunny location for at least a few days (the 120\u00b0F/48.8\u00baC minimum target temperature should be monitored in the center -most location with a thermometer). Bedbugs also succumb to cold temperatures below freezing, but the chilling period must be maintained for at least two weeks. Atte mpts to rid an entire home of bed bugs by raising or lowering the thermostat will be entirely unsuccessful. Wash all linen on hot, dry on hot setting. Gather all linen, cloth and leather bags, mattress covers, clothing, teddy bears... etc. Machine wash on hot - wash the laundry bag also. Tumble dry on hot. Steam kills bed bugs. Some metropolitan areas offer bed bug laundry and dry cleaning services which have the added benefits of proven methods for killing bed bugs and bagging or storing cleaned items so they do not become re -infested while the residence, program location or office area is still being exterminated. If something cannot be washed or discarded (such as a valuable leather purse) spray with non-toxic bed bug spray, seal in a plastic bag and leave for a few months. Dry clean to remove odor if need be. After handling Companion belongings, valuables, bed linens etc. please ensure that bed bugs did not crawl onto your pants and/or shoes. They are considered hitchhikers and can crawl, 3 HSP47 Cr eated: June 2 01 7 Re vi ewed: Febr uar y 2 02 3 H SP47 albeit slow, t o another source. If bug(s) are seen, please try to capture the bug and put it into a container. Hold for the exterminator to examine. If bugs are identified please follow protocol listed above and contact the Facility Manager. In order for the exte rminator to evaluate the environment and ensure appropriate extermination measures are done, when speaking with the Facility Manager, please provide the location where bugs were seen. If bug(s) were captured, please provide a specimen to the exterminator. BED BUG CYCLE ADULT BED BUG - UNFED ADULT BED BUG - FED ROACH CYCLE for Comparison Responsibility of: All Coworkers Monitored by: Facility Manager, Joint Health and Safety Committee 1 HSP48 Created: June 2017 Reviewed: February 2023 HSP48 HEAD LICE PEDICULOSIS - HEAD LICE Pediculosis is a common problem with children and youth, however can occur with adults. Head lice poses no real health risk to the population and is viewed as no more than a nuisance by health care professionals. However, since the condition can be transmi tted to others, proper and successful treatment is essential. POLICY Any Companion found to have evidence of head lice infestation is to be isolated from programming until proper treatment for lice has been completed. PROCEDURE Coworkers must inspect a ny Companion suspected of having head lice. If the Companion has evidence of head lice the following steps will be taken: 1. All Companions will be checked within their residences by Coworkers. 2. If lice are found, either chemical or non -chemical treatme nt options will be given. TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUAL Chemical treatment is the use of a medicated shampoo. The decision to use chemical treatment will be made after consulting the pharmacy to ensure the Companion has no allergies or potential medical issues with the treatment. Note - Manual removal is necessary with either treatment option. Chemical Treatment Apply as directed. Follow directions on package insert carefully. Manual Removal Sit in a comfortable chair with a good source of light (natural sunlight is preferred). Thoroughly clean and comb out hair removing all tangles and debris. Work on one section of the hair at a time. Comb each section away from the scalp using a fine too th metal comb. Clean off the comb after each stroke to remove any caught lice or eggs. Remove nits with fingernails or safety scissors if nits remain after several attempts with the comb. 2 HSP48 Created: June 2017 Reviewed: February 2023 HSP48 TREATMENT OF PERSONAL ARTICLES AND CLOTHING Heat is lethal to lice and their eggs, therefore, many personal articles can be disinfected by machine -washing in HOT water and/or machine drying, using the hot cycle of the dryer. Non -washable items may be disinfected in the dryer, provided that heat wi ll not harm them. If total reliance is placed on the clothes dryer for disinfection, dry articles for at least 20 minutes at the high heat setting. Machine wash all washable clothing and bed linens that have been in contact with the infested individual w ithin the previous three days. Non -washable items can be vacuumed, dry -cleaned or placed in a plastic bag and sealed for 14 days. Combs, brushes, similar items can be disinfected by soaking them in one of the pediculicide shampoos for one hour or by soak ing them in a pan of water heated on the stove to about 150 degrees for 5 - 10 minutes. Because lice can live only a short time if they fall off the head, environmental clean up is limited to simple vacuuming of carpets, upholstered furniture, etc. Use of insecticides or fumigants on upholstered furniture, carpets, bedding, etc. is not recommended.

In humans, they can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Ac ute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The disease caused by the coronavirus has been named COVID 19. While many of the characteristics of COVID 19 are still unknown, mild to severe illness has been reported for confir med cases. Symptoms The symptoms of COVID 19 are similar to other respiratory illnesses, including the flu and common cold. They include cough, sneezing, fever, sore throat and difficulty breathing. Transmission COVID 19 is spread by droplet transmission. The mere act of get ting the virus airborne in droplets from coughing, sneezing, aggressive talking etc. can be enough to spread the virus by droplet. Research has shown the virus can live outside the body for many days on most hard surfaces including plastics, steel, copper and cardboard. The length of time the virus can survive varies according to the research source. When a person touches a surface with the virus, the mere act of touching the eyes, nose or mouth (mucous membranes) can be enough to infect the person with the virus.

What this means is that we see our grantors, sponsors, and donors as integral partners of Glenora Farm. We believe in respectful, transparent communication about impact and reject fundraising tactics involving escalating solicitat ion. We uphold the Donor Bill of Rights created by the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the Giving Institute. The Donor Bill of Rights can be found here . We may follow up on contributions with a brief donor survey. This survey enables us to collect the information we need to prepare your tax receipt, understand the intention behind your gift, and honour your wishes in regards to recognition and future communications. This survey allows us to identify important information like when supporters wish to remain anonymous, when donations are mad e in the name of others, and whether or not contributors would like to receive news and event invites from Glenora Farm. #2: Focus on Impact We understand that our donors give to Glenora Farm because they believe in our work and want to support the differ ence it makes to our people, our land, and broader communities. For this reason, we are committed to ensuring that your contributions are focused on programming and services rather than donor incentives* (*see #3). #3: Equal Valuation Glenora Farm is supported by a diverse network of individuals, families, groups, clubs, organizations, foundations, and businesses who give according to myriad unique circumstances. Therefore, we seek to celebrate every gift (including non -monetary support), whether large or small, as equally valuable to Glenora Farm. With this horizontal approach, we do not use \"levels\" OP28 Created: January 2019 2 Reviewed February 2023 OP28 to differentiate gifts. Instead, we acknowledge all contributions above $25 with the same core recognition practices. Our core recognitio n practices (for gifts valued $25+) include: A personal phone call within 3 business days of receiving your gift. A hand signed thank you card and small (sustainable) gift. Acknowledgement via our website (supporter page), Facebook page, and annual repor t. An Honorary Glenora Farm membership o This is a non -voting membership that includes: Our Glenora Gazette newsletter An invitation to our AGM Complimentary passes to our theatrical and musical performances We also acknowledge that in some cases additional recognition is appropriate (e.g. sponsorships, grants, special projects, donations in memoriam/the name of others).

Responsibility of : Board of Directors Monitored by: Executive Group OP30 Created: April 2022 1 Reviewed February 2023 OP30 DONOR RECOGNITION - NAMING A FEATURE POLICY The Ita Wegman Association builds and nurtures relationships in the wider community to inspire philanthropic donations and partnership contributions. Significant donations to The Ita Wegman Association offer an opportunity to name an Ita Wegman Associatio n feature in recognition of the donation. PROCEDURE 1. Purpose To establish a formal approach for naming physical features. 2. Scope Physical features refers to all features owned or leased and operated by The Ita Wegman Association including: Building and othe r structures; Parcels of land or gardens; Building sites; Facilities, facility features and units such as levels, wings, rooms, and resource centers within building and structures; Vehicles, equipment, or other tangible assets. 3. Principles The Ita Wegman As sociation may choose to recognize outstanding persons by naming a feature in their honor, but such recognition needs to be balanced with the Society's need to attract external funding. The naming of The Ita Wegman Association features shall be based on the following principles: Support the fundraising activities of the Society; Enhance and maintain the Society's image and reputation in the wider community; Strengthen internal and external relationships and partnerships; Provide consistent, equitable and app ropriate naming opportunities to Society supporters; Align the naming commitments of Society features with flexibility required for space resource allocation. 4. Naming Structure OP30 Created: April 2022 2 Reviewed February 2023 OP30 Features will include both a functional and recognition naming component: Functi onal identification naming o A Society feature is named primarily as a means to help the community understand its functions and find its location. For this reason, the identification of the Society feature shall be evident in its name. For example: Rotary Boardroom or Smith Family L ibrary. Recognition naming o A Society feature is named to acknowledge or honor the contribution of the donor, a member of the The Ita Wegman Association community, or of the community at large. The honouree may be selected posthumously. 5. Roles and responsibilities Board of Directors As the ultimate governing body for the Society, the Board of Directors is accountable to: o Review and, where appropriate, approve the naming of all Society features; o Provide direction, when requested, on naming issues of a unique or complex nature or that m ay affect the integrity of the Society. The Board of Directors retain their discretion to make exceptions to this policy, as appropriate to the circumstances. Communications and Marketing The Communications and Marketing Designate is accountable to: o Evaluate naming, assess naming request recommendations against guiding principles, consult with affected bodies, and recommend potential names, as appropriate; o Maintain a master inventory of Society features with naming recognition opportunities; o Oversee the Soc iety graphic design standards; o Develop naming strategies for fundraising initiatives, including capital campaigns and/or sponsorships, consult with affected bodies, and present recognition naming strategies to the Board for approval, as appropriate. 6. Administration of recognition naming Term lengths The length of the naming shall be for the length of the physical existence of the particular facility or feature identified in the agreement between the Society and OP30 Created: April 2022 3 Reviewed February 2023 OP30 the party concerned. When the feature is reloca ted and the new space will serve the same original purpose, the name may also be relocated at the Society's discretion. An agreement or memorandum of understanding shall only apply as long as the named Society feature remains in the ownership or under the control of The Ita Wegman Association. Changes and terminations The Board of Directors has the right to terminate the naming of a Society feature for the following reasons: o If a naming commitment is connected to a donor or contributor whose activities reflect negatively on the Society's public image or are in material conflict with the Society's mission and/or policies. o When a donor or contributor fails to fulfill their pledge commitment as specified in the written agreement or memorandum of understanding and when an alternative pledge period has not been agreed upon. o Where the Society no longer has ownership or control of the features (for example, part of the facility is sold to a third party). o The feature is decommissioned due to age or obsolescence. The Society respects the right of a donor or contributor to request that the Society remove a name and in such cases, the request will be reviewed with the Board of Directors. The donor or contributor will assume 100% of the cost of any change they request to the signage. The Ita Wegman Association reserves the right to r eview, revise, or decline the proposed change. If a Society feature is relocated within the same building or to a different building, provided that the new facility or room will serve the same original purpose, no approval is required under this policy to relocate the name. In such circumstances, the name may be relocated at the Society's discretion. If a structure is demolished, or when its occupancy or usage changes, then the naming commitment related to this structure shall also cease. Where possible, The Ita Wegman Association will inform the appropriate contact person of the usage change or the decision to demolish the facility. Agreements Where a written agreement is signed between the donor or contributor and the Society, the terms of revocation, th e length of time of naming, and the location of the feature named and its description will be included. In the absence of a OP30 Created: April 2022 4 Reviewed February 2023 OP30 written agreement, a copy of this policy will be given to the donor, contributor, or the parties concerned. Design guidelines The design of the naming and recognition signage shall be consistent and shall reflect the branding and aesthetic of the Society. To maintain this consistency: o The Communications and Marketing Designate oversees the development and implementation of design gui delines for signage in keeping with the Society graphic design standards; o The Communications and Marketing Designate determines the appropriate wording for recognition naming signage.

There is a strong desire on the part of our Coworkers and Contractors to play a key role in decisions affecting both their tasks and the Association . Coworkers and Contractors want to improve the Association's overall effectiveness as well as accomplish their own responsibilities. There is a need for an accurate, timely, and unfiltered flow of communications from within the Association that helps it e ffectively administer as well react to opportunities, challenges and change in a timely manner. Regulatory compliance is important. The sheer volume of laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines has increased dramatically. PROCEDURE ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCY Policies provide guidance, consistency, accountability, efficiency, and clarity on how the Association operates. This provides all members of the Association guidelines and principles to follow. Policies define the goals of the Association and provide guidance about how to achieve objectives. Established procedures ensure the Association's processes do not deviate or deteriorate over time, even if key personnel leave. Consistent policies also help new board members and Coworkers and Contractors get u p to speed quickly on how the Association operates and what's expected of them. GOVERNMENT COMPLIANCE Regulatory compliance is when the Association follows federal, provincial and local laws or regulations relevant to operations. 0P31 Created: August 2021 2 Reviewed February 2023 OP31 Often compliance is required by government mandate and requires conformity to avoid penalties and reprimand. Examples: Payroll taxes must be deducted from Coworker and Contractor pay and remitted to the government within exact time period Community Living British Columbia has exte nsive compliance and reporting requirements Local government requires compliance to health and safety regulations Regulatory compliance helps protect the Association's resources and reputation. It takes time to build trust with the government, parents, rep resentatives, prospects, and vendors, and a big part of that centers on our ethical behavior. EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS In communications, a channel is the means of passing information from a sender to a recipient. Determining the most appropr iate channel, or medium, is critical to the effectiveness of communication for the Association. Channels include oral means such as meetings and telephone calls, and written modes such as instructions, reports and email. If you choose the wrong channel - that is, if the channel is not effective for the type of message and meaning you want to create - you are likely to generate misunderstanding and possibly end up making matters worse. Getting the channel right is just as important as sending the right messa ge. There are two main channels: Communication and Tasks. COMMUNICATION CHANNELS Communication channels are the free flow of information among Coworkers, supervisors and leadership, directors, suppliers, parents, Companions and more. Communication channels within the Association can be downward, upward, horizontal, diagonal or external (outside the Association). This is the day -to-day lifeblood of the Association and is highly encouraged to be unencumbered with any restrictions. Companions and their family members, representatives and/or significant others are encouraged to share feedback, thoughts, feelings and i deas in a manner that best meets their needs. Communication channels can be in writing, verbal or any 0P31 Created: August 2021 3 Reviewed February 2023 OP31 other method that a companion and family member, representative or significant other identifies as such. We make every effort to ensure feedback communic ated is heard and represented in all our decision and planning efforts. Information shared that is of a medical or sensitive nature is treated as confidential and highly restricted. Examples of Communication Channels: Communications can range from a casual conversation with a companion, email to a coworker or a formal presentation in front of several people: Face -to-face Email Phone call Voice messages Video such as Facetime In-person oral presentations Online meetings Letters Reports Website and blogs (website articles) Newsletter Social media posts (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) Communication routes are the straight lines that speed communications directly to their recipients, at the moment communication is necessary. A communication network doesn't follow autho rity lines and is established around the affiliation of members of our Association and includes networking and spontaneous conversations. Communication occurs in any direction and takes place between individuals of different status and roles. Communication frequently crosses boundaries within the Association and is commonly separate from workflows. That is, it often occurs between people who do not work together directly but share a common interest in the Association's activities and a motivation to perform their tasks well. Communication occurs outside the Association's established channels for conveying messages and transmitting information. AUTHORITY AND TASK CHANNELS 0P31 Created: August 2021 4 Reviewed February 2023 OP31 A task channel follows authority lines and is established around the structure of the Association. A task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a defined period of time or by a deadline to work towards work -related goals. The Power of Coworke r and Contractor Responsibility An effective approach to issuing directions is to describe the work to be completed and ask for Coworker and Contractor responsibility and initiative. Most people prefer to have some degree of control over how they complete their work. When you let a Coworker or Contractor know what needs to be done, you may be able to give them the freedom to come up with their best way of completing the task. Supervisors and leadership must explicitly define the intended results. Authoritative Tasks, Direction, or Instruction A directive is an authoritative task, direction, or instruction. This can be verbal, in writing or covered in policy. Orders are issued by seniors to juniors Compliance is from juniors to seniors Orders and compliance s should be in writing A verbal order should be followed by one in writing Written communication is an effective channel when context, supporting data, and detailed explanations are included. Task channels run along the official lines of authority. Orders go down and compliance goes up. Regulatory Compliance The term \"compliance\" is the act of adhering to or conforming with policy or a directive. It also includes conforming to statutes (governm ent laws and regulations), rules and policies as part of our operations. Our goal is to always be in full compliance with government directives. Regulatory Compliance Training 0P31 Created: August 2021 5 Reviewed February 2023 OP31 Our policies and procedures are often tied to compliance requirements which Cow orkers and Contractors need to be trained on. Where policy is written to address specific compliance issues, then our training should rei nforce that behavior and ensure Coworkers and Contractors understand what they are supposed to do. Coworkers and Contractors at every level need to adopt the philosophy that compliance is \"everybody's business\" - even if there are designated Coworkers and Contractors to oversee our compliance program. Compliance isn't just about a handful of people who know the latest regulations and what that means for operations. Rather, everybody is up to speed on the latest changes, and they've been trained on how it im pacts them. Continual Improvement Compliance is not a one -and-done program. Our Association needs to build in regular review periods and audits to ensure compliance. This allows the Association to continually assess the effectiveness of the program and be proactive in our actions. This allows the Association to set workflows and reminders and route it to the appropriate people who need to review and make changes. These steps will help create an effective regulatory compliance program in our Association that protects our resources, reputation, as well as internal and external audiences. Examples of Authority Channel (task orders): Board of Directors to Business Administrator: Get the accounting department to prepare monthly financial reports with comparisons to the approved budget together with variance analysis. Maintenance Manager to Maintenance Worker: Fix the tractor as it won't start. Get finance approval in advance if it costs more than $300. Controller to bookkeeper: Record the purchase of the new van from the restricted funds bank account. Supervisors and/or leadership to House Coordinator: There is a government inspection on Wednesday, next week. Please ensure that all mandated regulations are in full compliance. Examples of Task Compliance: 0P31 Created: August 2021 6 Reviewed February 2023 OP31 Business Administrator to Board of Directors: Attached are the monthly financial reports with comparisons to the approved budget and a variance analysis. This is repeated each month. Maintenance Assistant to Facility Manager: I installed a new battery \u2014the tractor now starts every time. The cost was $296.00. Bookkeeper to Controller: The purchase of the new van from the restricted funds bank account has been recorded and the bank account reconciled (agreed) to the bank statement. House Coordinator to Supervisor and/or leadership group: All mandated regulations are in full compliance. Attached is a compliance checklist ready for inspectio n. Sometimes, all it takes is one compliance misstep and we've broken the trust it has taken years to build. By not following compliance regulations, we might even risk losing access to certain funding options. Compliance lays the foundation on which we build our Association's reputation. Formal, written policies and procedures improve overall organizational performance by keeping everyone \"on the same page\" when it comes to compliance, expectations and issues. When everyone is 100% clear about what needs t o be done, how it needs to be done and who's responsible for doing it, it leads to smooth operations and compliance to applicable laws and regulations.
