The staff is caring and capable. Their target demographic is independent seniors. While they do offer special care for those that may need it, they are somewhat limited with what they can do if the client is not mentally or emotionally sound. My mother's deteriorating condition quickly overwhelmed the staff. However, they really did well for longer than was probably best for them or my mother. I'll also take this opportunity to say how much I appreciated the help I got from Karen Marlatt at A Place for Mom. She was an invaluable resource and her experience and caring attitude were greatly appreciated. [Cedar Creek of Bloomington](/community/cedar-creek-of-bloomington-85645) We made a very difficult decision to place our mother in a senior center with levels of care, following the death of our father and her subsequent health decline. After a diligent search, we found Monroe Place to be the best solution for her. The individual rooms are apartments and we found the 1 bedroom apartment with separate living quarters, to be the perfect size for her. During her stay, the management staff was consistently friendly, professional and very caring. They treated us more like an extended family. The nurses were attentive, personable, very professional and demonstrated that they truly cared. The facility offers housekeeping, laundry, three meals per day and gentle reminders for the residents that it is meal time. In our case, it was extremely advantageous as they offered onsite physical therapy which our mother required and the therapists hhelped her a lot -- again professional, caring and they know their jobs. The onsite beauty/barber shop was much appreciated, with reasonable prices and friendly stylist who did a fabulous job. The attendants who provided care were always visible, friendly and ready to help and the maintenance person treated my mother and residents (that I observed) as they were the most important part of his day. I was extremely impressed with the on-boarding process - we were greeted by residents who knew our mother was new to the facility and she was assigned to a table where the residents were very friendly and seemed to sponsor her as she adapted to her new environment. To be honest, our mother was not ready for this transition and at times, she found the transition to be difficult, the staff assisted with this as much as they could. The only criticism that we have, is that the food is so-so. Our mother and other residents, would site this as a concern for them. I ate there a few times to test this and I found it was fair, not great but fair. Microwaves and refrigerators are in the rooms. Someone is there around the clock for the residents and the facility is secured- this was a huge relief for us. There is a friendly resident rescue dog who wonders the halls and is a member of the community. There is no routine shuttle transportation provided for residents, but I worked with the staff and they assisted me in finding options should we require these services. Tip: Williams Brothers Pharmacy offers prescription medicine delivery and if your loved one is required to have the nurse medicate them, make sure and have their medications bubble packed through the pharmacy. I would highly recommend this facility and this outstanding staff. [Gentry Park Senior Living in Bloomington, IN](/community/gentry-park-senior-living-1397523) I think it's a good place for my loved one. She has some confusion, but not really full-fledged dementia. A lot of the residents around her and more confused, but she requires more total care in terms of her physical well-being. She's confined to a wheelchair and is the textbook definition of frail elderly. I think she gets along well with the staff. She's \"with it\" most of the time, and they're able to take care of her bodily needs. Their communication with us is pretty good. We've set up a schedule to have a Zoom meeting three times a week. During the Spring that was working well, but during the Summer it's fallen off a bit, perhaps due to vacations and things. But we've been able to adapt to phone calls instead. In terms of anything like medication changes, falls, anything out of the ordinary, they call you right away. So I have no qualms about that. "}
