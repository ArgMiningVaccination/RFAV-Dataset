It is equipped API for realizing Bluetooth LE wireless communication and API for implement a custom profile. Moreover, it supports two types of system configurations (embedded and modem configuration). |Title|| | |Title|| | | | The module corresponds to the following integrated development environments (IDEs): CS+ (CA78K0R Compiler/CC-RL Compiler), and e2 studio (CC-RL Compiler).

It has a simple AT command execution function to control and set Bluetooth LE communication, thereby realizing virtual UART communication where characters are transmitted/received via Bluetooth LE communication.

It is possible to flexibly respond to demands such as adding Bluetooth LE to an existing application. We also have host samples for Renesas microcontrollers. This enables the shortening of the development period.
