In 2014, many people who were previously ineligible for public health coverage will become eligible for new or different programs. Alameda County provides this guide for our community-based partners and providers who are assisting Alameda County residents with health care, whether it be through providing enrollment assistance or medical and behavioral health services. We recognize that the many health care changes are difficult to understand and explain to clients who look to you, our community partners, to answer their questions. This guide is a resource that outlines the changes to Alameda County health care in 2014 in simple and transparent terms. At the time of print, many questions about specific programs are still being answered. Although this guide represents the most accurate and current information available to date, many decisions are still being made at the federal and state level that may significantly impact the information provided in this guide. Alameda County will continue to make updates as new information becomes available.Sarah Yuen Linville Interagency Children's Policy Council Gabriela Tunzi Social Services Agency With contributors and editors from Alameda County Health Care Services Agency Alameda County Social Services AgencyThis guide was created through collaboration among the Alameda County Interagency Children's Policy Council, Social Services Agency, and Health Care Services Agency.Purpose of this guideALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE REFORM GUIDE Version as of November 7th, 20131Table Of Contents I.

This guide will educate Alameda County partners and providers about the various federal, state, and local changes created by health care reform. First, the guide will provide an overview of federal health reform changes that impact the entire nation. Second, the guide will walk through changes across California as a result of health reform implementation. Third, the guide will discuss impacts to Alameda County health care coverage options and provide specific information on how low-income Alameda County residents can enroll in these various programs. Lastly, there are notes on specific populations as well as resources for those interested in learning more. Overview of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is the comprehensive health care reform legislation enacted in 2010 by the federal government. Different pieces of the ACA have been implemented since the legislation passed, but in January 2014 a number of the major tenets will go into effect and have a significant impact on state and local governments, organizations, and individuals. The ACA expands coverage and improves affordability in California by allowing the state to increase what services are covered, providing funding for California to expand eligibility for the Medi-Cal program, and establishing a health insurance marketplace that gives California residents greater ability to choose the health care plan that best suits their needs and preferences. Employers Must Offer Health Coveragei Employers with more than 50 full-time employees must offer employees a health insurance plan that pays for at least 60% of covered health care expenses for a typical population, ii AND , that isn't more than 9.5% of the employee's family income. Smaller employers (less than 50 full-time employees) are exempt, but can receive tax credits for offering health insurance plans to employees. 1 1 See http://coveredca.com/small_businesses.html for more information on small business health coverage options. Did You Know? Young adults can remain on their parents' health insurance plans until the age of 26, even if they are married or no longer dependent on their parents. ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE REFORM GUIDE Version as of November 7th, 201352 See https://www.healthcare.gov/how-does-the-health-care-law- protect-me/ for more information. *Source: Kaiser Family Foundation, 2013. \"The Requirement to Buy Coverage Under the Affordable Care Act.\" <http://kff.org/infographic/the-requirement-to-buy-coverage- under-the-affordable-care-act/>Individuals Must Obtain Coverage: The \"Individual Mandate\" Beginning in January 2014, every individual, including children, must obtain health insurance with minimum essential coverage of services. There will be a penalty imposed upon individuals who have not obtained health insurance. The penalty will increase each year and will be withheld from an individual's federal income tax return. Exceptions to the Individual Mandate Some individuals may not be fined if they do not have health insurance. These include those who: Cannot find insurance tha t costs less than 8% of their household income Are undocumented immigrants Are Native Americans Object to health insurance on religious grounds Are incarcerated Have incomes below the threshold for filing a tax returnNew Rights and Protections The following new protections from the ACA began rolling out in 2010. All of the protections will be in place on January 1, 2014. 2 A selection of pre ventive care and women's services are now free (See Appendix C) . Group health plans cannot exclude enrollees under age 19 based on pre-existing conditions. For other plans, all pre-existing condition exclusions must be removed beginning in 2014. Insurers can no longer cancel coverage due to mistakes in forms, procedure, etc. Insurance companies must publicly justify any unreasonable rate increases. Insurance companies must spend at least 80% of the cost of consumers' premiums on health care (not administrative costs). Individuals can seek emer gency care at a hospital outside of their health plan's network. Consumers ha ve a right to ask their plan to reconsider when it denies payment for specific services. 2014 Adult: $95 Child: $47.50 Total: Up family income Individual Mandate Penalty: 2014 and beyond*Version as of November 7th, 2013 ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE REFORM GUIDE6Changes to Health Care Coverage Across California This section explains how certain ACA requirements, specifically the establishment of a health insurance marketplace (an \"exchange\") and related features, will be implemented in California. The Exchange: Covered California The ACA mandates that every state create a health insurance marketplace, otherwise known as an \"exchange.\" Exchanges are places where uninsured consumers can compare selected private health insurance plans in their area. The idea is to make it easier for the public to see the costs, benefits, and quality of each plan before purchasing one. California has decided to run its own exchange; some other states have decided to let the federal government run their exchanges. Individuals and families eligible for exchange- based plans will enroll and manage their coverage through California's exchange, known as Covered California . People can shop for plans that meet their needs and level of income using a comparison tool. Insurance companies on Covered California must offer Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) that provide minimum essential coverage. These QHPs vary according to the proportions of total health costs that an average person would pay. 3 Many different insurance companies are participating and competing in the marketplace, which keeps premiums and costs low for participants. Covered California plans in Alameda County, plan types, and provider network information can be found to the right.Covered California Eligibility & Enrollment Covered California is open to all citizens and legal permanent residents whowish to enroll, if they are not alreadycovered by other public, private, oremployer-sponsored insurance. Adults underthe age of 30 who do not want to payhigher premiums for plans with morecomprehensive coverage can enroll in acatastrophic health plan through Covered California, which will have low monthlypremiums but less coverage. Individuals and families can enroll in QHPs by phone, online, or by visiting a Certified Enrollment Entity (see page 9 for partial list of eligible entities). When individuals look to enroll, they should check to see that the physician they would like to see and the hospital that they are most likely to go to are in the network for the insurance providers that they are interested in.Did You Know? The open enrollment period for plans through Covered California is from October 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014. Otherwise you must wait until the next period or a qualifying life event in order to enroll. Future enrollment dates are from October 1 to December 15th for the following January 1, 2015, start date. 3 Covered California website: www.CoveredCA.comPlan Nam e Network Information Alameda Alliance for 464-4000 From Covered California Health Insurance Plans, last updated November 2013* Removed from Covered California until further notice.ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE REFORM GUIDE Version as of November 7th, 20137Enrollment Online: www.CoveredCA.com When a client logs onto the Covered California website and completes their secure identification information, Covered California will then show a selection of customized plans that are available to the client based on age, income, and location. When an application is completed through Covered California, there may be enough information to determine preliminary eligibility for other assistance programs (i.e., CalFresh or CalWORKs). If an applicant appears eligible for another program, they will be referred to the appropriate county agency for a final eligibility determination and enrollment into those other programs. Behind the Scenes: CalHEERS Covered California created a new electronic database system to manage enrollment information. CalHEERS (California Health Eligibility Enrollment and Retention System) maintains all client records for Covered California plan enrollees and communicates with other databases that contain information on client income and eligibility for other programs (e.g., the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Social Security Administration). CalHEERS is designed to utilize information from other county, state, and national databases that contain client identification, tax, and citizenship information.Enrollment by Phone: Customer Service Call Center One new system to assist in enrolling people in Covered California QHPs is the Covered California Customer Service Call Center . These Centers will field enrollment, eligibility, and case management calls. Covered California will begin enrollment on October 1, 2013 . Consumers can contact Covered CA at 1-888-975-1142 . Calls will be answered by one of the three new state call centers in California: Concord (Contra Costa), Fresno, and Rancho Cordova (Sacramento). When Covered California Customer Service Center agents receive a call, they will ask basic questions in order to conduct a \"quick sort\" for enrollment eligibility: Number of people in the family? Anyone seeking coverage who is under age 19? Anyone seeking coverage who is pregnant? Anyone seeking coverage who is elderly or disabled? Annual income? If a caller appears to be potentially eligible for Medi-Cal (California's low-income health care program; see page 11 ) through the \"quick sort,\" the caller will be transferred to a local county-based and county-staffed customer service call center to do a Medi-Cal eligibility determination. Covered California will also perform case management of those enrolled in Covered California health care plans, including updating information, assisting with annual renewals, and managing enrollees with Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTC) and/or Cost-Sharing Reductions.Version as of November 7th, 2013 ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE REFORM GUIDE8Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTC) & the Reconciliation Process Low- to middle-income individuals and families (between138% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level [FPL]) 4 that enroll in plans through Covered California may be eligible for federal subsidies, or Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTC), for their health care coverage. These tax credits are assessed on an income-based sliding scale when they receive insurance through Covered California. APTC will lower the amount individuals will pay towards their monthly premiums. Individuals and families have the option of receiving their tax credits upfront each month to pay for the premium, or receiving their credit when they file their taxes at the end of the year. If they choose to take the upfront monthly credit, this money will go directly from the federal government to the health insurer to pay a portion of their premium. If they choose to receive the tax credit at the end of the year, the federal government will send the tax credit to the individual/family in a lump sum, similar to how they send tax refunds. The upfront monthly tax credit amount will be a projected estimate based on the income documents that the individual provided from the past year. The estimation of income is based on: Current income (from the IRS) Expected change in income (must be reported to the Exchange) At the end of the year, Covered California will conduct a reconciliation process that may require repayment if the subsidy given was based on incorrectly estimated income for that year. 4 2013 FPL Guidelines: www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP- Program-Information/By-Topics/Eligibility/Downloads/2013- Federal-Poverty-level-charts.pdf Cost-Sharing Reductions Individuals or families with income between 100% and 250% FPL may also be eligible for cost-sharing reductions, which allow them to enroll in a plan with lower out-of-pocket costs. To access these savings, an eligible individual or family must enroll in a Silver Plan through Covered California. (The lower out-of-pocket costs are reflected in the Silver Plan cost calculators available through Covered California.) The exact amount of out-of-pocket support provided will depend on the income of the individual or family enrolling in the plan. Individuals and families do not have to keep track of any cost-sharing reductions, or submit paperwork for reimbursement. Like the premium tax credits, the cost-sharing reductions are paid directly to the health insurance plan by the federal government. However, unlike the premium tax credits, for cost-sharing reductions there is no reconciliation requirement at the end of the tax year, even if individual or family income changes during the year.ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE REFORM GUIDE Version as of November 7th, 20139Certified Enrollment Entities (CEEs) Certified Enrollment Entities (CEEs) are organizations that provide education, outreach, and enrollment assistance to consumers, and help them apply for and maintain coverage. There are two types of CEE programs - In-Person Assistance (IPA), also called Certified Enrollment Counselors, and the Navigator Program. 5 Eligible Covered California Certified Enrollment Entities include but are not limited to: American Indian Tribe/Tribal Organizations Chambers of Commer ce City Government Agency Community Clinics Community Colleges and Univ ersities Faith-Based Organizations Labor Unions Non-Profit Community Organizations Ranching and farming or ganizations Resource partners of Small Businesses School Districts Tax Preparers Trade, industry, professional organizationsOrganizations must apply to become certified entities. All entities are trained and registered to provide in-person assistance. Selection will be based on an organization's strategy for enrolling eligible and currently uninsured individuals in coverage, educating individuals on the types of subsidized and non-subsidized health plans, and encouraging individuals to retain insurance. Certain CEEs, mostly insurance agents, are compensated through the types of plans that the individuals they assist enroll in. Other entities, such as community clinics, are eligible to receive compensation for enrollment per person enrolled. Certified Enrollment Counselors and the Navigator Program There are some key differences between how Certified Enrollment Counselors (also known as IPAs) and the Navigator Program function and receive compensation. Differences in roles and responsibilities for IPAs and the Navigator Program are: Navigators conduct broader public education activities to raise awareness about Covered California, the Qualified Health Plans, and associated policies and opportunities. Navigators are compensated through a grant. IPAs are compensated per successful application or per successful renewal. 5 See https://assisters.ccgrantsandassisters.org/ to apply to be a Certified Enrollment Entity through Covered California.What does that mean? Certified Enrollment Entities provide in-person assistance, education, and outreach, as well as developing retention and enrollment strategies to reach people who are uninsured.Version as of November 7th, 2013 ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE REFORM GUIDE10In-Person Assistance Prog ram Naviga tor Prog ram sful Covered ini/g415al or rene wal Grant -based pr ogra m performanc e- based block funding based on gr antees ' Covered California QHP enrollment targets.

This section explains the eligibility changes to existing Alameda County programs as well as new eligibility rules under health care reform. Medi-Cal Medi-Cal is California's federally funded low-income health program. Beginning in January 2014, Medi-Cal will be expanded to include income-eligible childless, non-disabled adults. Eligibility for Medi-Cal will be calculated in two ways, but the program will remain the same: 1. Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is a method of calculating income based on IRS tax records. Using the MAGI method eliminates a separate asset test. 6 Populations evaluated under this methodology include: Low-income children, ages 0-19, NOT considered eligible for Medi-Cal through participation in foster care, adoption assistance, CalWORKS, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs. 7 Childless, non-disabled adults, ages 19- 64, up to 138% FPL. Parents or adult caretakers of a child who qualifies for Medi-Cal. Pregnant women (women up to 138% FPL receive full-scope, no-cost Medi-Cal, while those between 138% FPL and 200% FPL are eligible for pregnancy services 8). 6 The asset test looks at family resources, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, and other property. The asset limits are $2000 for an individual and $3000 for a couple. 7 Income limits are up to 138% FPL; families with incomes higher than this may have a Share of Cost. Families with incomes higher than 250% are ineligible for certain Medi-Cal Programs. See Footnote 4 for 2013 FPL Guidelines. 8 California is still debating if pregnant women above 138% to 200% FPL can receive full-scope coverage through Covered California, with state assistance. Details to be determined.Medi-Cal provides the same services for all populations eligible under MAGI calculations, with one exception. Pending federal approval, newly eligible single adults ages 19-64 must pass an asset test to receive long-term care. 9 2. Populations not using the MAGI methodology include those who qualify for Medi-Cal automatically through enrollment in other programs such as: foster care, adoption assistance, CalWORKS, and SSI. These programs, with the exception of foster care and adoption assistance, require an asset test. The income guidelines are usually below 133% FPL. HealthPAC HealthPAC, the Health Program of Alameda County, provides affordable health care to low-income, uninsured people living in Alameda County, through an approved network of local health care clinics and facilities. 10 In 2014, this program will still be available to Alameda County residents under 200% FPL who are not eligible for other health care programs. 9 Updated as of September 11, 2013. 10 For a list of providers, go to: http://www.acgov.org/health/ documents/HealthPACbrochure-en.pdfWhat does that mean? MAGI is a method of calculating income based on IRS tax records. MAGI methods eliminate the asset test and change the way that household size is calculated.Version as of November 7th, 2013 ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE REFORM GUIDE12Determining Eligibility for Health Care Programs Eligibility for public health care programs is generally based on income, age, residency status, family size, and other situations such as pregnancy and disability. Alameda County has created a comprehensive chart that shows eligibility for health care plans and programs in 2014. Use this tool to determine which plans clients are eligible for. How to Use This Chart The 2014 Eligibility Chart for health care programs in Alameda County is intended to make it easier to determine client eligibility for various programs. Begin by looking at the age of the client, and if he/she has any special status (e.g., disabled, pregnant). Next, look at their residency status and then estimate the household/family income. Use this information to determine which health care program the individual is likely to be eligible for. Note: Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) with less than 5 years residency may be treated differently in 2014. Previously, LPRs with less than 5 years residency were eligible for state-only funded Medi-Cal if they met all other eligibility requirements for the program. Beginning sometime in 2014, this will change. As of legislation passed in June 2013, LPRs with less than 5 years residency, between 0 and 138% FPL, and without dependent children, will be eligible for a Covered California plan. The state will cover their premium costs, cost-sharing, and any Medi- Cal benefits not offered through their plan. Starting in 2014, or when the California Department of Health Care Services and Covered California have operational capability, this group will enroll into Covered California during open enrollment but remain eligible for state-only Medi-Cal if they miss the open enrollment period. Until such operational capability is reached, LPRs with less than 5 years residency will remain covered under Medi-Cal. LPRs with less than 5 year s residency, with Medi-Cal eligible children, will still be eligible for state-only Medi-Cal (same as current policy). LPRs with < 5 years residency and greater than 138% FPL to 400% FPL are eligible for tax credits to purchase a Covered California plan. Adults and families who ha ve been Legal Permanent Residents for 5 or more years and are below 138% FPL are eligible for Medi-Cal. Those between 138% FPL and 400% FPL are eligible for Covered California.

Context & Information about Specific Populations Although the ACA introduces sweeping changes for everyone, specific populations will be affected in many different ways. This section details other changes and other health-related programs that are applicable to individuals of the following categories. Aged Individuals ................................................................... 22 Children .......................................................................... 22 Disabled Individuals ................................................................ 23 Mental/Behavioral Consumers ................................................. Immigran ts ....................................................................... 24 Homeless With HIV/Aids .............................................................. 25 Pregnant Women .................................................................. 25Version as of November 7th, 2013 ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE REFORM GUIDE22AGED INDIVIDUALS Medicare Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people age 65 and older. For more information on enrollment and eligibility see Section II: Coverage, Service Eligibility and Payment (Medicare). The ACA expanded Medicare's coverage of free preventive services, such as screenings for colon, prostate, and breast cancer. Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan The ACA has narrowed the gap in Medicare Part D prescription drug plan costs to make it more affordable. Previously, when a Medicare beneficiary entered the \"donut hole\" they became responsible for the total cost of a covered drug until they spent enough on medications to be considered \"catastrophic,\" after which point the prescription drug plan would again share the cost of the covered drug. As a result of the ACA, that coverage gap will be closed entirely by 2020. Aged individuals will still be responsible for 25 percent of their prescription drug costs. Alliance CompleteCare Alliance CompleteCare is a health plan for residents of Alameda County that combines Medicare, Medi-Cal and Part D prescription drug coverage with no premiums, deductibles, or co-pays, as well as dental and vision care. Call 1(877) 585-7526 or visit their website at: http://www.alamedaalliance.org/visitors/health-plans/alliance-completecare/ Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Supplemental Security Income is a federal cash assistance program for low-income, low-resourced individuals. Aged individuals and/or couples are eligible for SSI if income is not greater than the current SSI monthly benefit in California ($886.40 for an individual/$1122 for a couple). Assets are limited to $2000 per individual, or $3000 for a couple. These individuals are automatically linked to Medi-Cal. CHILDREN Most low-income children are eligible for Medi-Cal. Families with higher incomes may have a share of cost. Immigrant children who have not been Legal Permanent Residents for over 5 years may qualify for health care coverage through Medi-Cal, while their parents may qualify for health insurance through Covered California. One option for children who do not qualify for Medi-Cal due to their family's income/assets being too high is the Kaiser Child Health Program (CHP), which is available through Kaiser as of November 7th at: http://info.kaiserpermanente.org/html/child_health_plan/eligibility.html.

To receive SSDI, you need 40 credits (10 years), 20 of which were earned within 10 years of becoming disabled. 13 \"Disability\" under Social Security is based on your inability to work. Individuals are considered \"disabled\" under Social Security eligibility rules if: They cannot do work they did before; They cannot adjust to other work because of their medical condition(s); AND their disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year, or will result in death. Individuals are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part A & Part B after receiving disability benefits for two years. Individuals with certain disabilities can receive Medicare sooner.
