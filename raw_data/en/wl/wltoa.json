Clients may also independently turn to complementary prod - ucts or practices to address co-occurring medical issues such as pain or to achieve personal health and wellness goals such as weight loss. At the same time, an increasing number of medical facilities and behavioral health programs are including complementary health approaches in their menu of services. Complementary therapies vary in their safety, cost, and evidence of effectiveness. Clients may spend a great deal of time and money on products and services without knowing whether or how they work. In addition, clients may be unaware that some complementary therapies can have side effects or adversely interact with medications. Some clients may not tell their behavioral health service practitioners of their use of complementary therapies; other clients may ask practitioners whether complementary health approaches are helpful. Practitioners may also be called on to explain the benefits of any complementary practices offered by their treatment programs. This Advisory gives behavioral health service practitioners a brief overview of complementary health approaches and information on efficacy and cautions so that they can talk knowledgeably with clients and offer appropriate guidance.What Are Complementary Health Approaches? The term complementary health approaches encompasses a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered to be part of con- ventional medicine . 1 Also called \"mainstream,\" \"modern,\" or \"Western\" medicine, conventional medicine is practiced by doctors holding medical degrees and by allied health professionals, and its practices are evaluated scientifically for evidence of effectiveness. Most Americans use nonmainstream practices as complements, rather than as alternatives, to conventional medicine. 1 Generally speaking, complementary therapies have not been evaluated as extensively and rigorously as practices in conventional medicine. Many complementary therapies have emerged out of ancient medical systems, such as Ayurvedic medicine from India, traditional Chinese medicine (which includes acupuncture), traditional African medicine, shamanism, and Native American healing practices. Other systems that offer comp-lementary therapies, such as homeopathy and naturopathy, stem from practices that emerged in Europe beginning in the late 18th century. (See Exhibit 1.) An increasing number of medical care and behavioral health facilities now offer integrative health (also known as integrative medicine ), which combines complementary practices with 2 ADVISORY Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recover Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recoverconventional treatment plans. More than 60 academic health centers and affiliate institutions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico are members of the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health and include complementary health approaches in their curricula. According to the Consortium, inte - grative medicine and health \"reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic and lifestyle approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.\" 5 Development of scientific evidence in the field of complementary and integrative medicine has been advanced by the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, * which funds and conducts research and provides information for consumers and practitioners. Some complementary therapies are now covered by health insurance or other reimbursement systems. * On December 16, 2014, legislation was enacted that changed the name of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.Exhibit 1. Examples of Nonconventional Medical Systems2, 3, 4 Ayurvedic medicine: a system of traditional Indian medicine that aims to integrate and balance the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurvedic practices aim to cleanse the body of substances that can cause disease, and this is believed to help reestablish harmony and balance. Ayurvedic remedies are often herbally based. Homeopathy: a system of medical practice based on the theory that any substance that can produce disease symptoms in a healthy person can cure those symptoms in a sick person. For example, someone suffering from insomnia may receive a homeopathic dose of coffee. Ingredients for homeopathic remedies are derived from plants, minerals, or animals. Typically, the ingredient is highly diluted, and other active ingredients may be included in the mixture. Naturopathy: an alternative medical system that proposes that a healing power in the body establishes, maintains, and restores health. Practitioners work with patients to support this power through nutrition and lifestyle counseling, dietary supplements, medicinal plants, exercise, homeopathy, and treatments from traditional Chinese medicine. What Types of Practices and Products Are Considered Complementary? A variety of health practices and products can be included under the label complementary. Manipulative and body-based therapies The category of manipulative and body-based therapies includes interventions that a trained practitioner per - forms on the client. It also includes therapies in which the client receives training in certain movements and exercises designed to address overall mental, spiritual, and physical health. (See Exhibit 2.) In the United States, practitioners of manipulative and body-based therapies typically receive formal training and obtain certification granted by a licensing board or a related professional organization. Mind and body medicine Interventions that seek to harness the power of the mind to make positive health changes are included in the category of mind and body medicine. (See Exhibit 3.) Some of these therapies are based on the idea that the body has energy fields that can be manipulated for health through the use of light, magnets, or touch.Complementary Health Approaches: Advising Clients About Evidence and Risks Fall 2015, V olume 14, Issue 2 3 Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recover Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People RecoverExhibit 2. Examples of Manipulative and Body-Based Therapies2 Acupuncture: from traditional Chinese medicine, a system of procedures involving stimulation of anatomical points on the body to treat various physical, mental, and emotional conditions. The practitioner pierces the patient's skin with thin metallic needles to adjust the flow of energy ( qi) through the body. Other variants of acupuncture use heat, electricity, lasers, or pressure. Alexander technique: a movement therapy that seeks to improve posture and movement by teaching a person more efficient use of muscles to enhance the body's overall functioning. Chiropractic care: a form of health care that emphasizes adjusting the spine and joints to influence the body' s nervous system and natural defense mechanisms to alleviate pain and improve general health. Doctors of chiropractic, also called chiropractors, use this hands-on therapy (called manipulation or adjustment) as their main clinical procedure. Massage: manipulation of muscle and connective tissue to enhance function of those tissues and promote relaxation and feelings of well-being.Osteopathy: a full-body system of hands-on techniques to alleviate pain, restore function, and promote health and well-being. In the United States, osteopathic physicians practice modern medicine in addition to performing manual osteopathic techniques. Pilates: movement therapy that uses physical exercise to strengthen and build control of muscles, especially those used for posture. Awareness of breathing and precise control of movements are integral components. Special equipment is often used.Natural products Natural products include vitamins; minerals; botanicals (herbs, seeds, and other plant products); probiotics (live microorganisms similar to beneficial microorganisms found in the human gut); amino acids; and other substances found in the human diet, such as enzymes. Typically, natural products are taken orally in the form of a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid (such as in a tea or tincture). They may also be applied topically and absorbed through the skin (such as with a poultice or cream). Many natural products are aggressively marketed and are widely available to the public without prescription at grocery stores, health food and nutrition stores, and drug stores and through the Internet. Some natural products (such as chamomile for tea and turmeric used as a seasoning) may also be cultivated and grown at home.Under federal law, if a product is promoted as intended to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, it is considered a drug; a natural product promoted with - out such claims may be marketed as a dietary supple - ment. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve dietary supplements for safety (except when a supplement contains a new dietary ingredient not previously approved) and effectiveness, as it does for prescription and over-the-counter medications. However, FDA does monitor the labeling claims made on dietary supplements, and the Federal Trade Commission monitors the advertising claims. 6 Despite this monitoring, product promotions for dietary supplements may imply benefits that cannot be explic - itly stated without the product being categorized as a drug. Because federal law does not require standardization of dietary supplements, products of the same type 4 ADVISORY Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recover Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recoverdiffer in terms of ingredient combinations, amounts, and potency. Manufacturers must follow FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices for dietary supplements, which require that dietary supplements be accurately labeled and produced in a manner such that they meet the manufacturer's specifications regarding the identity, purity, strength, and composi - tion of the ingredients used. 7 However, no regulatory agency tests dietary supplements to ensure that they contain only the ingredients claimed and that ingredient amounts are accurate as stated.Exhibit 3. Examples of Mind and Body Medicine2 Biofeedback: a method using electronic devices to teach clients how to improve health by consciously regulating breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and other bodily functions. Deep breathing: slow and deep inhalation and exhalation through the nose. Attributed benefits include release of tension, pain relief, and better organ function. Energy healing therapy: the channeling of what is believed to be healing energy through the hands of a practitioner into a person's body to restore a normal energy balance and, therefore, health.Guided imagery: relaxation techniques using visualization of calm and peaceful images. An individual receiving guided imagery treatment will visualize his or her body free of a specific problem or condition.Hypnotherapy: a procedure aimed at producing an altered state of consciousness characterized by increased responsiveness to suggestion. Objectives vary but include reducing anxiety, relieving pain, and improving sleep. Meditation: a variety of techniques that discipline the mind to promote relaxation, generate energy, and improve other-oriented traits such as compassion and generosity. Meditation is rooted in Eastern religions, but it does not conflict with other religious or cultural practices. Mindfulness meditation involves a focus on the present moment, with a nonjudging acceptance of thoughts and feelings as they occur. Progressive relaxation: a technique used to relieve tension and stress by systematically tensing and relaxing muscle groups. Qi gong: an ancient Chinese discipline combining the use of gentle physical movements, mental focus, and deep breathing. In addition to improving physical health, qi gong is intended to provide benefits such as reductions in stress, pain, and depression. Reiki: an energy healing therapy that originated in Japan. The practitioner places his or her hands on or near the person receiving treatment, with the intent to transmit ki, believed to be life-force energy. Tai chi: a Chinese mind and body practice in which the body moves slowly and gently through a series of poses. It is believed that tai chi helps the qi, the vital energy, flow through the body. Tai chi is sometimes called moving meditation. How Popular Are Complementary Health Approaches? The 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) found that a third of adults in the United States had used some type of complementary practice or product in the 12 months before the survey. 8 This level of use is consistent with levels reported in the surveys conducted in 2002 and 2007. 8 According to the 2012 NHIS, the complementary health approaches most commonly used by American adults are nonvitamin/nonmineral dietary supplements (17.7 percent); deep breathing (10.9 percent); yoga, tai chi, or qi gong (10.1 percent); chiropractic or osteopathic care (8.4 percent); meditation (8.0 percent); and massage therapy (6.9 percent). According to the 2007 NHIS, the most common reason for accessing complementary health approaches is for pain relief (e.g., back, neck, joint). 2 In 2007, Americans spent $33.9 billion out of pocket for complementary therapies. 9 A large portion of this Complementary Health Approaches: Advising Clients About Evidence and Risks Fall 2015, V olume 14, Issue 2 5 Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recover Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recoveramount was for products, classes, and materials not specifically recommended by a healthcare provider or complementary health practitioner. 1 How Popular Are Complementary Health Approaches for Treatment of Mental or Substance Use Disorders? The 2007 NHIS found that 45.4 percent of adults who were current moderate or heavier drinkers * had used complementary health approaches in the preceding 12 months (reasons unspecified). The survey also found that in the preceding 12 months, 2.8 percent of adults had used complementary health approaches for anxi - ety, and 1.2 percent had used complementary health approaches for depression. 2 * Current moderate or heavier drinker \u2014Adults who, on average, consumed more than 3 drinks per week up to 14 drinks per week for men and more than 3 drinks per week up to 7 drinks per week for women were moderate drinkers. Adults who, on average, consumed more than 14 drinks per week for men and more than 7 drinks per week for women were heavier drinkers . To be considered a current moderate or heavier drinker, the survey participant had to have consumed at least 12 drinks in his or her lifetime.2A 2005 study of data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication determined that 6.8 percent of participants with a mental or substance use disorder ** had used a complementary therapy (alone or with treatment from another source) to treat the disorder in the 12 months before the survey interview. 10 The study also found that, in the same 12-month period, 31.3 percent of all mental health visits were to complementary health practitioners. 10 ** Mental disorders included anxiety, impulse control, and mood disorders.What Is the Appeal of Complementary Health Approaches for Behavioral Health Treatment? For a variety of reasons, complementary health approaches can be especially appealing to behavioral health clients. Individuals who have not been suc - cessful with a particular conventional treatment may be curious about trying complementary therapies as adjuncts or treatment alternatives. Or, such individu-als may hope that augmenting conventional treatment will enhance their recovery. Some clients may have a lifestyle preference for products and healing systems they perceive as natural, want to avoid medication side effects, or appreciate the hands-on care they receive from a complementary health practitioner. From the standpoint of the behavioral health treatment program, offering a complementary therapy that is culturally relevant or popular in the community may attract prospective clients to the program's conven-tional treatment offerings and support retention. Some practices, such as meditation or movement-based therapies, may help clients gain self-efficacy skills. Complementary practices offered to groups may also enhance clients' socialization skills and support systems. How Effective Are Complementary Health Approaches? Complementary health approaches have been insufficiently studied compared with conventional treatments. Many of the studies that have been con - ducted lack one or more features of the randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is the gold standard for evaluating biomedical or behavioral interventions. An RCT compares a treatment with a different treat - ment or with a placebo and randomly assigns subjects to experimental and control (comparison) groups. RCTs are often blinded (that is, the subjects or the scientists administering the experiment, or both, do not know which treatment each subject is receiving) and, ideally, include sample sizes large enough for study results to achieve statistical significance. A well-designed RCT seeks to account for all possible variables that may influence the study results.6 ADVISORY Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recover Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People RecoverThese features of the RCT can present challenges when assessing complementary practices. For exam - ple, some complementary practices involve multiple components (e.g., movement combined with medita - tion and deep breathing); teasing apart the effects of each component adds to the already considerable amount of time, funds, and labor required to conduct an RCT. Also, when studying interventions such as yoga or acupuncture, it is often not feasible to blind study participants and those administering the inter - vention. Yet another challenge is that complementary health practitioners typically customize the treatment to the individual. For purposes of an RCT, however, the intervention must be standardized, which can make a study's results less relevant to real-world application. The challenges of evaluating comple - mentary health approaches through well-designed RCTs are prompting health researchers to explore alternative trial designs.11 Another challenge in evaluating the efficacy of complementary health approaches is the ongoing debate over the value of the placebo effect. Evidence on a variety of complementary practices indicates that positive effects that occur may be attributable not to the treatment itself, but rather to the interac - tion between the complementary health practitioner and the patient, the patient's beliefs and expectations about the treatment, and the setting and cultural con - text in which it is provided. Evidence that the placebo effect may play a potentially significant role in some complementary therapies has led some researchers to label complementary health approaches as \"placebos.\" However, some researchers claim that the placebo effect is a powerful force that can be effectively har - nessed through complementary health approaches to facilitate the body's ability to heal itself. 11 The task of helping clients make informed, evidence-based decisions about complementary health approaches is complicated by\u2014as just described\u2014the lack of convincing data, questions about the most appropriate means of evaluating these practices, and the unre - solved controversy over the role of placebo in treat - ment. 1,11,12,13 Presented below are summaries of the existing evidence on selected complementary health approaches for mental or substance use disorders, as provided by systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a low-risk, low-cost therapy that, based on anecdotal evidence, can relieve physical withdrawal symptoms, help with relaxation, and sup - press cravings for drugs and alcohol. 14 A small per - centage of substance abuse treatment programs\u20144.4 percent\u2014offer acupuncture as an adjunct therapy. 15 Some systematic reviews have focused specifically on acupuncture for treatment of disorders involving opioids, 16,17 alcohol,18 and cocaine.19,20 These reviews did not find evidence of efficacy, and the authors have concluded that more research is needed. A 2009 review of clinical trials found some evidence for acupuncture's effectiveness with opioid withdrawal but not for treatment of other conditions such as alcohol withdrawal, nicotine relapse prevention, or cocaine dependence. 21 A 2013 review of 48 RCTs testing acupuncture for use with patients who had alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, or opioid dependence con- cluded that nearly half of the clinical trials reviewed had at least one positive result (e.g., on craving), indi-cating that different types of acupuncture may have beneficial effects at different points in the withdrawal and recovery process. 13 A substantial number of studies have been done on acupuncture as a treatment for mental disorders. A review published by the American Psychiatric Associa-tion's Task Force on Complementary and Alternative Medicine concluded that the data do not suggest that acupuncture is effective in treating major depressive disorder. 12Complementary Health Approaches: Advising Clients About Evidence and Risks Fall 2015, V olume 14, Issue 2 7 Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recover Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People RecoverMindfulness meditation An increasing amount of research has focused on mindfulness meditation, with 477 articles published in academic journals in 2012 alone. 22 In a systematic review of 14 randomized and 10 nonrandomized controlled trials, the authors found evidence that mindfulness-based interventions can reduce consump - tion of substances of abuse when compared with various controls, and they found preliminary evidence that the interventions can reduce cravings. 23 Movement therapies For the treatment of mental or substance use disorders, exercise is theorized to provide social and psycho - logical benefits by increasing socialization, improv - ing emotional regulation, decreasing sensitivity to anxiety, and improving stress management. It is also postulated that because exercise triggers neurological effects similar to those produced by opioid drugs, exercise may serve as a substitute for substance use. 24 Exercise to promote physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual health is called movement therapy . Some studies have investigated movement therapies in relation to specific mental or substance use disorders. A 2013 meta-analysis of 37 RCTs found that exercise is moderately more effective than no therapy or a control intervention for reducing symptoms of depression. 25 A 2011 meta-analysis of 10 RCTs found that yoga-based interventions have a statistically significant effect when used as an adjunct for treat - ing severe mental illness, especially when current treatment modalities are inadequate or have adverse effects (e.g., weight gain, cardiovascular disease). 26 A 2014 review of eight studies on yoga for treatment of addictions reported that seven of those studies showed positive effects; the article authors concluded that the results are \"encouraging but inconclusive\" because of methodological limitations. 27Although evidence of exercise's effect on mental and substance use disorders is inconclusive, the benefits of routine physical exercise for overall health, wellness, and quality of life are well documented. At the least, exercise can be a helpful adjunct therapy to behav - ioral health treatment, and clients may benefit from participation in a movement-based complementary practice such as yoga, Pilates, or tai chi. A doctor's guidance on appropriate types of exercise or move - ment therapy is advised for clients who are pregnant, have a specific medical condition (e.g., multiple scle - rosis, back injury, osteoporosis), or have not exercised in a long time. Natural products Of the many dietary supplements marketed to con - sumers as having mental health benefits, two of the most popular are omega-3 supplements and SAMe (S-adenosyl methionine). Some omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients obtained from food sources such as fatty fish and certain plants such as flax. SAMe is a chemical that is naturally found in almost all tissues in the body. Exhibit 4 provides evidence of effectiveness and cautions for both of these products. Many herbal products are also marketed to consumers for treatment of mental disorders. Exhibit 4 lists two examples, kava and St. John's wort. Among the many other botanicals marketed as treatments for mental health conditions are brook mint for anxiety or insom - nia, chamomile for insomnia, lavender for anxiety or insomnia, linden for insomnia and nervous tension, 28 passion flower for insomnia and anxiety,28,29 and vale - rian for anxiety.28,30 RCTs and systematic reviews provide little evidence that homeopathic medicines are effective for any spe - cific condition. 4 The key ingredient can be extremely diluted, so the principle of action does not appear to be science-based. Even when the main ingredient is highly diluted, there may be other active ingredients in the mixture, including alcohol and metals, that can cause side effects and drug interactions. 48 ADVISORY Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recover Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People RecoverExhibit 4.

Such herb-drug interactions have been documented for MAOIs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, used to treat depression. Interactions have also been documented for medications to treat other conditions, including HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. St. John's wort can also interfere with the efficacy of oral contraceptives, anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants used with transplantation, anticoagulants, and other types of medications. 29 Products made from St. John's wort vary considerably in the quantity and quality of their active compounds, leading to variability in interactive and other side effects. 34 Note: Information on the utility, efficacy, and safety of other nutritional supplements can be obtained from PDR for Nutritional Supplements (2008).35 This reference book provides monographs on nutritional supplements currently in use, and it indexes those monographs in multiple ways, including by indications, side effects, and interactions. Information on herbal products can be obtained from PDR for Herbal Medicines (2007).29 This reference book includes monographs indexed by indications, side effects, herb-drug interactions, and safety, among other categories.Complementary Health Approaches: Advising Clients About Evidence and Risks Fall 2015, V olume 14, Issue 2 9 Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People Recover Behavioral Health Is Essential To Health Prevention Works Treatment Is Effective People RecoverAyurvedic medicine has not been sufficiently studied in RCTs to determine effectiveness.3 Ayurvedic medi - cines in the subset called rasa shastra have additional ingredients deliberately added; these additives may include metals, minerals, and gems. A study of 230 such products purchased over the Internet from India or the United States found that nearly 21 percent contained detectable levels of lead, mercury, or arsenic. 36 What Guidance Can Behavioral Health Service Practitioners Offer? Practitioners can help clients understand that the offered treatment and support services are evidence-based; that is, high-quality research has shown the services to have positive outcomes. A practitioner can also help a client realize the importance of practitioner-client communication about complementary therapies, to ensure that any such therapies that the client tries are supported by evidence of effectiveness and do not present risk of side effects or adverse interactions. Suggestions for managing the practitioner-client conversation follow. Be prepared with language to explain to clients the meaning of \"evidence-based\" and to succinctly describe how any recommended treatment and services have been evaluated. Be ready to explain that if a first course of treatment is not effective in moving the client into sustained recovery, other evidence-based courses of treatment can be tried. Become better informed about complementary health approaches and the evidence base and cautions for these practices in behavioral health treatment (see Resources). Question clients about the use of complementary practices during intake and at regular intervals. Ask clients to report all therapies they use for any purpose, not just for treatment of a mental or substance use disorder. Convey tolerance and respect when discussing clients' use of complementary health approaches, and support their interest in asserting control over their own health.Encourage clients who are taking or considering taking any natural products (including Ayurvedic, homeopathic, or naturopathic remedies) to confer with a medical care practitioner or pharmacist. Urge clients who are pregnant or nursing to talk with their prenatal care practitioner. Advise clients on prescription medication to confer with their medical care practitioners about potential herb-drug interactions. Advise clients who will be undergoing surgery to confer with their medical care practitioners about any use of herbal medicines, because some can affect heart rate, blood pressure, or rate of bleeding and therefore should not be used for 2 to 3 weeks before surgery. 37 Advise clients seeking to improve their overall health through dietary supplements not to overlook the importance of a nutritious diet and exercise. Direct clients to nutritional counseling and information sources on safe and appropriate exercise. Advise clients that a great deal of misinformation about the safety and efficacy of complementary practices exists, especially on the Internet. Refer them to credible resources for evidence-based information (see Resources).
