The primary audience for the Handbook is first-line supervisors and work leaders. However, the Handbook's direction applies to all Forest Service employees. Direction in the Handbook generally is written in the imperative mood, which conveys mandatory compliance: \"Wear a hardhat on the fireline.\" The use of the helping verbs \"must\" and \"shall\" alsoconveys mandatory compliance. The use of \"should\" conveys re- quired compliance, except where justifiable circumstances make compliance unnecessary because there is no threat to workersafety or health. The use of \"may\" and \"can\" conveys optional com- pliance. Sentences in bold italic type indicate that a fatality resulted because of a failure to comply with a standard operating pro- cedure or practice. 01 - AUTHORITY. 1. The basic authority for safety and health standards is the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (sec. 19 and 24), as amended (Title 29 United States Code (U.S.C.), 668, 673), and theimplementing regulations issued by the Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (29 CFR), Part 1910, OccupationalSafety and Health Standards; Part 1926, Construction Standards; and Part 1960, Basic Program Elements for Federal Employee Occupational Safety and Health Programs and Related Matters. 2.

Keep windows, mirrors, and lights clean to better see and be seen. d. Check headlights, turn signals, and front tires (including wheels and lug nuts). e. Adjust mirrors. f. Check taillights, reflectors, and rear tires (including wheels and lug nuts). 4. Check the brakes by pressing firmly on the foot pedal, check the steering for any looseness, and check the horn. Know the function and location of all controls. 5. Before moving a vehicle, turn on the defroster fan to dis- lodge any dust and debris. 6. If the vehicle uses an alternative fuel, such as methanol, ethanol, diesel, or propane, familiarize yourself with the refueling procedures. Know in advance where the next funding station equipped with such fuel is located. 7. Do not fill a fuel tank beyond the normal shut off point and always allow for vapor expansion. 8. Secure all objects inside the cab and cargo area(s).9. Operators of vehicles 10,000 gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) and larger (single or in combination) must check wheels and lug nuts daily.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 10-14 Effective 12/01/1999 10. When work is performed on the wheel/tire/hub assembly (such as wheel bearings being packed), the operator should check for tightness after driving 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km). 11. Monitor vehicle performance when driving. Inspect a vehicle after use. Correct or report problems before a vehicle is used again. 12.34 - While Driving. 1.Always wear your safety belt(s).

When traveling on major divided highways designed for high-speed travel: 1. Plan your trip in advance; know the route and the highway numbers. Adverse weather conditions or construction work may require an alternate route or extra time. Know where to exit. Have adequate fuel. 2. Under ideal driving conditions, use the \"2-second rule\" in calculating following distance. Watch the vehicle ahead. When it passes a stationary point, such as a sign post or mileage marker,count \"1 thousand 1, 1 thousand 2.\" This is 2 seconds. If you reach the same stationary point before you finish those words, you are following too closely. Always compensate for changing weather androad conditions by increasing your following distance. 12.36 - Special Hazards while Driving on Forest Service Roads. Special hazards that drivers may encounter are: 1.Road Width. Roads with narrow driving surfaces, roads classified as single-lane with turnouts, and roads with few places to park or turn around. 2.Grade. Varying grade; range is from 0 to 18 percent. 3.Surface. A variety of road surfaces, including those that may be affected by weather. 4.Sight Distance. Sight distance which may be limited by adverse weather, blind curves, foliage, dust, smoke, and ambient light. 5.Other Road Users. Tourists, heavy equipment operators, motorcyclists, mountain bicyclists, and many other types of road users. Wildlife and domestic stock also may be encountered. 12.4 - Defensive Driving Techniques. 1. Drive slowly and use transmission gearing, engine com- pression, and gravity to slow the vehicle as it travels uphill. Con-versely, use engine compression and gearing on downhill grades. 2. Keep right. Drive as far to the right as possible without driving on the shoulder.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 10-18 Effective 12/01/1999 3. Keep headlights, taillights, mirrors, and all windows clean and clear. When conditions limit visibility, slow down, and turn on your headlights. 4. Always maintain control of the vehicle. For example, if unexpected wildlife or domestic livestock are encountered, slow down and try to avoid the animal. Generally, it is safer to hit theanimal rather than to drive off the shoulder of the road or cross the centerline and risk a head-on collision. 5.Parking. a. Select a location that allows a minimum of a 12 foot (4 m) width of unobstructed travel area and adequate sight distance in both directions. b. Assess the intended parking area for soft material, holes, rocks, or other debris that could damage tires/ undercarriage. c. When parking, position the vehicle for a forward depar- ture. Avoid backing the vehicle, when possible. d. Shut off the engine, set emergency brake, and put trans- mission in gear or park. e. Use chock blocks. 6.Methods for Backing. It is safer to do a backing maneuver when first parking rather than when returning to the vehicle. This allows the operator a complete and full view of the parking spot. It is better to park the vehicle (when possible) so the operator candrive forward and eliminate backing altogether. a. Never back up or make a U-turn on blind corners. b. Before backing: (1)Select a wide spot with a view that provides ad- equate sight distance in each direction. (2)Always use a person to serve as a guide for backing when available. (3)Walk around the vehicle and check for hazards and obstructions. (4)Back the rear of the vehicle toward a cutbank. (5)Use caution when backing on fill-sloped edges of roadways. (6)Always face the danger.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 10-19 Effective 12/01/19997.Winter Driving. a. In the JHA, identify winter driving hazards on a site- specific basis. Include precautions and techniques toabate hazards: (1) Slow down and increase following distance. (2) Do not use cruise control when roads might be slick. Cruise control can apply power at the wrong time and initiate a skid or make a small skid worse. (3) Follow precautions in all vehicles, including all-wheel- drive vehicles and four-wheel-drive vehicles. Al- though all-wheel-drive vehicles and four-wheel-drive vehicles may provide better traction, they do notdecrease the normal stopping distance. b. List necessary equipment/supplies in the JHA. Such equipment/supplies might include jumper cables, snowshovel, winter survival gear, and abrasive material (cat litter, sand, salt, or traction mats). c. Prior to winter driving season, conduct tailgate safety sessions to discuss safe winter driving practices, such as what to do in the event of a skid. 12.5 - Transporting Flammable/Combustible Liquids. Flam- mable liquids have a flash point below 100 oF (38 oC). Combustible liquids have a flash point at or above 100 oF (38 oC). Ensure that a JHA has been written before transporting such liquids.

Ensure that vehicles used for towing trailers comply with Federal, State, and specific Regional requirements regarding size, weight, and necessary equipment. a. For tongue type, tag-a-long trailers, gross trailer weight (GTW) is not to exceed 75 percent of the towing vehicle's gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). The actualloaded weights shall never exceed the gross axle weight ratings (GAWR). b. As truck gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWR) increase, the actual truck weight does not increase in the same proportion. There are situations where the best way to determine the towing capability of trucks over the nomi-nal 1 ton weight (GTW) is not to exceed 75 percent of the actual truck weight. Adding weight to the truck is a better choice than adding any weight to the trailer. Thisallows the towing unit to fully control the trailer. c. For fifth-wheel or gooseneck type trailers, use the manufacturer's published gross combined rating(GCWR), available from the fleet manager or specific vehicle towing specifications. These ratings reflect a combination of proper truck components, includingengine size, transmission, rear axle ratio, frame, and suspension. In no case shall the GCWR exceed the manufacturer's published GCWR nor shall any individualaxle exceed the specific gross axle weight (GAWR) stamped on the manufacturer's plate. 2. Keep hands and feet away from the coupling device when maneuvering the trailer into position for locking. 3. Never permit riders in or on trailers. 4. When backing a trailer, first get out and check the area to the rear, sides, front, and overhead to ensure the vehicle is clear of obstructions. Use an observer when available. 13.64 - Equipment. The following equipment is required for trailer use. 1. Warning equipment, such as reflective triangles or other suitable warning devices.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 10-32 Effective 12/01/1999 2. Brakes, lights, and markings as required by State and Federal regulations. 3. Safety chains to match or exceed the trailer weight rating. Chains shall be in place and crossed under the tongue. 4. Side-view mirrors that provide adequate rear vision. 5. Trailer jacks (horse and heavy duty trailers), which are generally not needed for light trailers, such as those used for ATVs and snowmobiles. 6. Trailer brakes for trailers with 1,500 pounds (680 kg) GTWR or above. 7. Emergency break-away system and wet or gel cell battery (trailers 1,500 pounds (680 kg) GTWR and above). 13.7 - Transporting Passengers. Drivers operating vehicles de- signed to transport more than 16 passengers (including the driver) must have a Commercial Driver's License and a Forest Serviceendorsement.

(1) Inspect the post driver before each work project or activity and periodically during use. (2) Put the driver over the post while the post is in a leaning position, then swing the post upright intoposition. Do not attempt to put the driver over a tall upright post. (3) When driving, use short strokes and do not operate the driver faster than you can maintain control. 4.Wood Fences. Do not store treated wood in enclosed spaces. Avoid contacting treated wood with bare skin. 5.Wire Fences. Always use caution when constructing fence. When possible, avoid installing fences under powerlines or near buried lines. Use properly maintained tools and equipment and usethem only for the purpose designed. a.Handling wire. Be aware of wire \"memory\"! Firmly wrap or hook the end of wire to a fixed object when unrollingthe wire from a spool. Use spool rollers with side guards to prevent side lash. Keep the wire spool level and unroll wire straight off the roll, not off the side.(1) When handling wire, always assign at least two persons to fencing projects. (2) Wire can break under tension. To avoid whiplash and/or backlash, stay alert and safely positioned. Be aware of sloped terrain and maintain sound footing. (3) When cutting wire, secure it on both sides of the pliers or cutting tool to prevent backlash. If neces- sary to ensure personal safety, have two people tocut the wire. (4) When driving staples, do not place arms or legs over or under the wire to steady a fence post. Keepthe wire close to your hand on the fence post. (5) Wire can easily be severed. Do not drive staples hard enough to damage the galvanized coating onthe wire.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-24 Effective 12/01/1999 b.Stretching wire. (1) When working with wire, always consider the gauge of the wire. Inspect the wire for nicks, weak spots,and splices. Repair the wire before stretching it. Remove and splice stressed kinks before the wire is stretched. (2) Roll up the wire slack slowly so kinks do not de- velop. Use a hammer or fence pliers to hold the wire in place while attaching weights, stapling, orreleasing the wire from obstacles. (3) When releasing wire from obstacles, stay on the side of the fence post that is opposite the wire. Beaware of wire recoil. 6.Electric Fences. Address the need for signing electric fence during the environmental analysis of a project area. Assess existing fence for the need to sign fencing commensurate with public use and the implied potential liability. Make sure the electric fence energizerhas its own separate grounding rod. Never permit more than one energizer to be connected to the same electric fence. a. Disconnect the feed wires of an electric fence during installation or repairs. b. When testing fence, wear rubber gloves, rubber soled shoes, and the appropriate Forest Service-approvedhardhat. c. Keep all metallic implements away from electric fences. d. Do not tether livestock with chains near electric fences.e. Avoid accumulations of groundwater or moisture near electric fences. 7.Clean Up.

If the cave requires technical climbing, the party shall consist of at least four members, two of whom are quali-fied technical rock climbers. In case of injury, one mem- ber shall stay with the victim, while two go for help. e. In a cave where the use of climbing equipment is not necessary, a party of three is acceptable. 3.Weather. a. Caves subject to flooding, such as those in canyon bottoms and in run-off pits, shall not be visited during periods of heavy precipitation or unsettled weather. b. In the winter ice often forms on cliffs and in cave en- trances. In the spring or during periods of warming, ice masses can detach and fall without warning. CaversWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-34 Effective 12/01/1999 shall avoid walking beneath ice masses and crossing winter snow that has blown into and plugged the tops of pits. 4.Biological Hazards. a. When entering caves, be aware of hazards associated with insects, reptiles, and mammals (sec. 53). b. When traveling through dusty areas within caves, wear dust masks. In desert areas and warm climates, cave dust can act as a vector for histoplasmosis, a seriouslung ailment. 5.Gases and Oxygen Deficient Atmospheres. a. Determine that any wild cave designated for entry by employees is safe by assessing the air quality and abating any hazardous condition as identified in the JHA. b. Regularly test and monitor for radon and other gas levels in commercialized caves. Establish safe and healthful working levels (time spent in the cave) and ensure ad-herence by employees. Radon is not a hazard to persons who infrequently visit caves; it is a health hazard for people exposed tohigh concentrations over long periods of time. It is only necessary to monitor caves where employees are re- quired to work underground for hundreds of hours eachyear. A naturally occurring colorless and odorless decaying radioactiveminerals. Radon is found in nearly all basements, homes, and caves. (1) Monitoring radon and establishing safe working levels should be done with the assistance of a knowledgeable industrial hygienist. (2) Radon concentrations vary widely from region to region and between caves due to factors such as rock composition, degree of natural ventilation, and season. As a result, monitoring programs shouldinclude air testing every month for at least 2 years to establish safe working levels.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-35 Effective 12/01/1999c. Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas, occasionally found in caves, which may reduce oxygen levels at the bottoms of pits or near stumps where it is produced bythe biological decomposition of organic material, such as wood or leaves, which are washed into caves by floods. Carbon dioxide, in lethal concentration, is ex-tremely rare and may never be encountered by a caver. Being heavier than air, carbon dioxide can concentrate in invisible pools near the floor or in depressions whereit displaces air and reduces the availability of oxygen. Be aware of situations where organic material has collected in areas of poor air circulation. At any sign of reducedoxygen (dimming of carbide lamp flames and candles or rapid breathing) leave the area immediately by moving upslope. 22.4 - Forest Management. 1.Qualifications.

In the woods or during truck scaling, as soon as scaling is completed, move to a safety zone to make notations in the scalebook. 2.Scaling in Woods and Landings. a. Stay clear for each turn of logs until chokers are clear and skidding equipment is out of the way. Ensure logshave stopped rolling and sliding and are secured. Never scale on landings where logs are being moved if there is a danger of a roll or slippage. b. Keep the scaling area clear of debris and unused rigging that may be snagged or rolled during the landing opera- tion. c. Be alert for and keep away from running lines, moving chokers, swinging logs, rigging, jammers, or cranes in operation.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-41 Effective 12/01/1999d.Never walk between a truck and a loading operation . e. Never turn your back on a moving truck. Stay clear of the loaded truck as it leaves the landing. f. Move to a safety zone when not actually scaling. Safety zones are usually toward the front of the landing, away from turnarounds, swinging lines, and the loading/deck-ing activity. g. If possible, arrange to scale at least one landing behind the active landing site. 3.Scaling on Trucks. a. Scale on trucks only after all logs are bound by chains or cables, and never scale during the loading operation. b. Never allow binder adjustments while scaling.c. Scale a loaded truck only when the vehicle is stopped, with brakes set, and the vehicle engine is turned off. (Diesel trucks may idle, provided wheels are chocked and brakes are set.) d. Use a standard scaling ramp equipped with platform catwalks or safety ladders. Provide tail and front boards where they are usable and will add to scaler's safety.Most falling accidents have occurred while descending from a load; never jump from the wing log to the platform or ground.(1) If a fully equipped scale ramp or platform is not available, then use a safety ladder when climbing or descending the load. The ladder must be equippedwith a nonskid base and extend a minimum of 3 feet (1 m) above the wing log. Refer to section 33.1 for further direction.

These sawyers have completed the nationally approved classroom and field training for general saw work (such as bucking, limbing, and the firstbasic steps in felling) or specialized uses (such as con- struction, maintenance, and fencing). Generally, they are trained at the local unit and must be supervised by aB or C level sawyer during saw work activity, which may include slashing and felling in the least complex situa- tions. This certification expires 3 years after the date ofissue. The certifier has full authority to impose restric- tions on apprentice sawyers as deemed necessary. b.\"B\" intermediate sawyer. This level includes skilled saw operators capable of performing only those tasks as approved by a certifier and documented on the back of the certification card. During saw activities, intermediatesawyers are not allowed to field certify sawyers. Certifi- cation is restricted to \"C\" advanced sawyers and \"C\" certifiers. This certification expires 3 years from the dateof issue. The certifier has full authority to impose restric- tions on intermediate sawyers as deemed necessary.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-49 Effective 12/01/1999c.\"C\" advanced sawyer. At this level of proficiency, advanced sawyers are approved to handle complex sawing and felling operations, including fireline construc-tion. They are qualified to conduct classroom and field training at the \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" level. They are also al- lowed to field certify \"A\" and \"B\" level sawyers. They arenot allowed to field certify at the \"C\" level; this certifica- tion is restricted to \"C\" sawyer certifiers.

Appropriate gloves (cut-resistant gloves for chain filing). 5. Long-sleeved shirt. 6. Chain saw chaps. The chain saw chaps shall meet the requirements of Forest Service Specification 6170-4; it is recom- mended that they overlap boots a minimum of 2 inches (51 mm). 7. Heavy-duty, cut-resistant or leather, waterproof or water- repellent, 8-inch high (204 mm) laced boots with nonskid soles (hard toes are optional). For further direction refer to FSM 6716.03, Personal Protective Equipment (Condition of Hire) Policy. 8. Fire shelter (wildfire and prescribed burn assignments).WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-50 Effective 12/01/1999 9. Required chain saw features: a. Throttle interlock. b. Falling and bucking spikes (or dogs) for falling and buck- ing operations (full set of two). Note: There are excep- tions for specialized non-felling uses. c. Anti-vibration system.d. Chain brake, fully functional. e. Proper saw for the job, fully operational. A full wrap- around handle bar for felling operations is recom-mended. The full wraparound handlebar allows the operator to use the bottom of the bar from either side of the tree; the saw then cuts, pulling the chain and thespikes into the tree. When using the top of the bar, the saw has the potential to kick out of the cut, which causes the operator to put extra effort into holding thesaw. This creates fatigue and takes attention away from other safety concerns associated with tree felling. Three- quarter handlebars are allowed for bucking and limbingonly. f. Proper bar length for the specific work project or activity. g. Bow bars with top and bottom chain guards and sting- ers. h. Chain, filed and maintained. 10. General equipment. a. First aid kit (refer to the Glossary). b. Fire extinguisher.c. Chain saw wrench. d. Chain file with handle and guard. e. Approved safety container for fuel.f. Chain and bar oil container, clearly marked. g. Proper wedges for the specific work project or activity (wooden wedges are not permitted). h. Single-bit axe or maul, 3 to 5 pounds (1 to 2 kg). 22.48d - Procedures. Chain saw and crosscut saw operations are skill related and must be \"hands-on-taught\" and learned. To teachnew employees and maintain operator proficiency, provide cutting areas for training to meet national saw training requirements.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-51 Effective 12/01/19991. Supervisors shall monitor proficiency of sawyers to recog- nize the need for recertification in less than 3 years in cases where employees have not used a chain saw enough to retain a safe skilllevel. 2. Instructors have complete authority to limit the scope of the certification and can impose restrictions such as specific project,specific function, size limitations, and species. 3. Standard procedures include: a. Ensure that personnel are alert and physically capable before allowing them to operate a saw. b. Ensure that tailgate safety and health sessions address saw safety before beginning work projects or activities.Refer to section 52.4 for ergonomic concerns. c. Include in the JHA: Spacing, leap frogging, and commu- nications.(1) Space employees and organize their duties so that the actions of one do not create hazards for others. (2) When a danger tree is identified, it must be physi- cally marked and no work can be conducted within the safety zone (2-1/2 tree lengths of the danger tree). d. Follow the manufacturer's safety, operation, and mainte- nance recommendations for the specific chain saw to be used on work project or activity. e. Ensure that trainee sawyers are under the supervision of a certified sawyer until they have demonstrated the ability to handle the saw independently and proficiently. Refer to sections 12.2 and 12.5 for further direction on equipment requirements for vehicles and for transporting saws. Refer to sec- tions 41, 43, and 44 for direction on requirements for handtools,power-operated tools, and heavy equipment. 22.48e - Safety Practices. Follow these basic safety and health practices: 1.No felling at night. 2.Situational Awareness and Size Up. Analyze the felling job by considering:WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-52 Effective 12/01/1999 a. Location of people, structures, powerlines, other ob- stacles. b. Roads and travel in the cutting area.c. Topography and steepness of ground. d. Nearby hazards such as trees, low-hanging and dead limbs, rocks, and brush. e. Primary and secondary escape routes, safety zones, and alternates . f.Wind direction and velocity such as steady versus gusting and/or changing directions. g. Tree species, both live and dead.h. Diameter and height of trees.i. Soundness of tree: split, lightning struck, broken-off top, rot, deterioration or physical damage to the root system, trunk, stem, limbs, or bark. j. Lean direction. k. Limb distribution. l.Widowmakers . m.Spiked top and/or schoolmarm . n.Burning top . o. Moisture in the form of rain, snow, or ice. 3.Primary and Secondary Escape Routes, Safety Zones, and Alternates. Escape routes are predetermined paths along which the sawyer proceeds once the tree is committed to the fall orto the bucking cut. Sawyers must select and prepare the work area by clearing a primary escape path and an alternate path before starting the cut. a. In tree felling operations, the quadrant opposite the planned fall of the tree is one of the most dangerous. Choose an escape path that extends diagonally away from the expected felling line and always have an alternate retreat path to a safety zone. b.Walk out and thoroughly check the intended lay or bed of the tree. Look for dead tree tops, missing tree tops, widowmakers, snags, and ground debris that may cause kickbacks, rolling, or result in another tree or limb becoming a hazard. c.Plan the route from the stump to the safety zone, generally not less than 20 feet (6 m) away; the farther the distance the better (ex. 01).WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-53 Effective 12/01/1999d.If possible, stand behind another tree, preferably quartering back from the planned direction of fall. Wait and watch for at least 30 seconds after the tree hits the ground for the whiplash branches and other broken tree parts. The shielding tree should be sound and of sufficient size to give protection. 22.48f - Saw Handling Techniques. General saw handling tech- niques include: 1.Carrying Saw: a. Carry the saw in a way to prevent contact with the chain, muffler, or bucking spikes.22.48e - Exhibit 01 - Primary and Secondary Escape Routes, Safety Zones, and Alternates EscapePathSafety Zone SafetyZoneDirection of Fall45 45 AlternatePathWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-54 Effective 12/01/1999 b. Point the bar forward when going downhill with the saw at your side. c. Point the bar backward when going uphill with the saw at your side. d. When carrying a saw on your shoulder, take extra care due to the sharpness of the chain and \"dogs\" (refer tothe Glossary). Wear a long-sleeved shirt, gloves, and a shoulder pad. Cover the bar and chain. Use of a manu- factured bar and chain guard is recommended.(1) Set the saw at idle speed and activate the chain brake when carrying a saw for short distances. (2) Shut off the saw when carrying it for a distance greater than from tree to tree or in hazardous con- ditions, such as slippery surfaces or heavy under- brush, and, in all cases, when carrying it more than50 feet (15 m). 2.Starting/Operating Saw. The methods to safely start and operate a saw can vary with the model and size. The followingbasic precautions generally apply regardless of the saw model: a. Maintain a secure grip on the saw at all times . b. Always start the saw with the chain brake engaged. c. Start the saw on the ground or where otherwise firmly supported. d. Do not \"drop start\" a chain saw.e. In general, throttle up to full speed before letting the chain contact the wood. f. In general, do not throttle down before the cut has been completed. g. Avoid cutting with the power head positioned between the waist and shoulders, which is considered a dangerzone. h. Do not cut with the power head positioned above shoulder height . 3.Fueling Saw. Select an area with bare ground for storing fuel and oil. a. Allow the saw to cool at least 5 minutes before refueling. (1) Fill the tank on bare ground or other noncombus- tible surface. (2) Immediately clean up spilled fuel.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-55 Effective 12/01/1999b. Refuel outdoors and at least 20 feet (6 m) from an open flame or other sources of ignition. c. Start the saw at least 10 feet (3 m) from the fueling area. 22.48g - Felling, Bucking, and Limbing Techniques. Use the following techniques to help ensure safety: 1.Observers and Spotters. a. The project supervisor and the sawyer shall determine jointly if spotters are needed during tree felling opera- tions. b.No employee shall approach a faller closer than 2-1/2 tree lengths of trees being felled until the faller has acknowledged that it is safe to do so, unless it is demonstrated that a team of employees is necessary to manually fell a particular tree. 2.Obscured Vision. Felling trees or snags is prohibited if the tops and surrounding area (the distance of 2-1/2 times the height of the tree to be felled in a viewing radius of 360o) are obscured by darkness, fog, smoke, or other condition. Do not allow felling, wedging, or hand pushing standing or leaning trees or snags when inadequate light impairs visual inspection of the haz- ard and the immediate work area. 3.Weather. Never start or continue to work during high winds, electrical storms, or in other hazardous weather. 4.Escape Paths. Before felling or bucking any tree or snag, always provide for escape in emergencies. Establish firm footing. a. Determine the lean of the tree using equipment, such as a straight handled hatchet, axe, or plumb bob, and recheck the primary and secondary escape routes and alternates. b.As tree lift begins, check the direction the tree is falling. Proceed along the predetermined escape path to your safety zone. Keep alert for falling debris and kickback. 5.Roadways, Trails, and Firelines. Ensure that adequate traffic control measures, such as signs, vehicles, or personnel, aretaken when felling or bucking across or alongside any traveledWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-56 Effective 12/01/1999 route. Maintain 2-1/2 tree lengths of distance between faller and all of the above. 6.Powerlines. If a tree to be cut is near a powerline, have the electrical utility authorities de-energize the line. Keep personnel clear until electrical utility authorities advise it is safe to proceed (sec. 36.13). 7.Other Workers. Make sure the felling never endangers nearby workers. Space employees and organize the duties of each employee so that the actions of one employee do not create a hazard for any other employee. a.Do not allow workers not in the felling crew to get closer than 2-1/2 tree lengths of the trees being felled. b.Have workers and felling crews working on the same contour, rather than some working above others on steep hillsides . c. Always watch the top of the tree throughout the felling operation. d. Before starting a back cut, shut the saw off and shout a warning to nearby crews. e. Before completing a cut, stop cutting, idle the saw, and shout warnings twice (or use a mechanical signal de- vice, whistles, or horns) to warn nearby crews that a tree is about to fall.(1) Make sure everyone is clear. (2) Complete the cut in the prescribed manner. 8.Felling. Follow these basic steps when felling: a. Fell problem trees or snags first. b. Undercut all trees exceeding 5 inches (127 mm) diam- eter at breast height (dbh) before making a backcut. c. Inspect your tree for a dead top, loose bark, limbs, and other debris leaning or hanging into it. Using a hatchet or axe, sound completely around the trunk of any largetrees to check for rot (refer to the Glossary). d. Watch out for other trees and tops that may fall in an undetermined direction when hit by a falling tree. e. Undercut and backcut all trees at a safe standing height. f. Never trust holding wood in partly rotted trees.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-57 Effective 12/01/1999g. Do not make any side cuts or corner cuts in hollow trees or trees with heartrot unless an adequate hinge can be maintained. h. Make the proper face/undercut with the opening large enough to control the tree nearly to the ground. (1) Make the downhill or off cut first. i.Begin the backcut by inserting wedges into the kerf as soon as practical (refer to the Glossary). (1)Continue cutting until the desired amount of wood holds the tree . (2)Ensure that sloping/horizontal cuts do not cross one another. j. Never leave a tree partially cut. Always finish the felling job before leaving for break, lunch, or at the end of the day or shift, with the exception that where hazards areunusually significant, leave trees standing, ribbon the area with hazard tree or danger area tape, or a suitable substitute, and notify your immediate supervisor. k. Never climb a lodged tree. Notify nearby workers and your immediate supervisor of the hazard. (1)Whenever possible, pull the lodged tree down by tractor, winch, or other mechanical means. (2)Consider all options\u2014including marking the hazard and walking away from it. l. Before returning to work on the felled tree, check all snags and adjacent trees for broken limbs, log chunks, loose bark, and overhead hazards. 9.Bucking, Brushing, and Limbing. Follow these basic steps: a. Never buck a tree that is considered unusually danger- ous. b. Consider bucking hazards, including overhead hazards. c. Anticipate the log's reaction when it is severed. d. Select the bucking cut location very carefully.e. Beware of other logs, branches, or rocks immediately behind the area where you are bucking, brushing, or limbing for possible kickback potential or rocking of thechain. (1) Remember that touching any object with the tip of the chain and bar can cause a kickback. (2) Know where the tip of the bar is at all times.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-58 Effective 12/01/1999 f. Remove limbs and brush before bucking. g. When topping, brushing, or limbing, be cautious about any tree held off the ground by its branches. h. To prevent rolling, do not cut limbs or branches that support the tree off the ground. i. Walk on top of large downed logs while limbing (if pos- sible) to prevent a log from rolling onto the operator. j. Be aware of side, top, bottom, and internal bind due to natural unevenness of the ground and objects, such asstumps, windfalls, and rocks. Initiate bucking slowly. Observe kerf closely to determine the bind. k. Cut a sapling or branch that is bound down only when it is necessary for safety. Make a series of small cuts on the decompressed side of the sapling or branch to re- lease the bind. l. Use wedges to prevent pinching bar. m. Completely saw off log chunks. n. When trees on sloping ground are bucked, use blocking devices that prevent bucked sections from rolling or sliding. Always work from the uphill side. o. Buck windfalls only after examining each tree to be cut for strains, breaks, binds, and the chance of root wads falling, rolling, or setting upright when the weight of the tree is removed. Be aware of trees that are underneaththe one you are bucking as they may be under pressure and could move in any direction when the overhead weight is cut or removed. 22.48h - Crosscut Saws.

I - Initiate all action based on current and expected fire behavior. R -Recognize current weather conditions and obtain forecasts. E - Ensure instructions are given and understood. O -Obtain current information on fire status. R -Remain in contact with crew members/your supervisor/ adjoining forces. D -Determine safety zones and escape routes. E - Establish lookouts in potentially hazardous situations. R -Retain control at all times. S - Stay alert, keep calm, think clearly, act decisively. 2.Watchout Situations. Ensure that all firefighters can recog- nize the 18 situations that shout \"Watchout\" and are aware of ways to mitigate the situation(s). 1. Fire not scouted and sized up.2. Located in country not previously seen in daylight. 3. Safety zones and escape routes not identified. 4. Unfamiliar with weather/local factors influencing fire behavior.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-84 Effective 12/01/1999 5. Uninformed on strategy, tactics, and hazards. 6. Instructions and assignments not clear. 7. No communication link with crew members/supervisors.8. Constructing line without a safe anchor point. 9. Building fireline downhill with fire below. 10. Attempting frontal assault on the fire.11. Unburned fuel between you and the fire. 12. Cannot see main fire, not in contact with anyone who can. 13. On a hillside where rolling material can ignite fuel be- low. 14. Weather becoming hotter and drier.15. Wind increases and/or changes direction. 16. Getting frequent spot fires across line. 17. Terrain and fuels make escape to safety zones difficult.18. Taking a nap near the fireline. 3.LCES. Lookout(s), Communication(s), Escape Route(s), and Safety Zone(s) are elements of a safety system routinely usedby firefighters. LCES has a broader application than just fire and should be considered as a valuable, useful tool for all field project work and activities. Examples include chain saw operations, workin confined spaces, hazardous materials, blasting, and driving. 4.Escape Routes. A pre-planned and understood route firefighters take to move to a safety zone or other low-risk areabefore the fire reaches their location. Have escape routes and make them known. Evaluate escape routes continually as fire conditions change and communicate those changes to all employees involved. 5.Safety Zone. A pre-planned area of sufficient size and suitable location that is expected to protect fire personnel fromknown hazards without using fire shelters. a. Do not consider the fire shelter an alternative to a safety zone. b. As a crew boss, safety officer, task force/strike team leader, or division group supervisor, establish and con- tinually inspect escape routes and safety zones andmake them known. c. Give specific instructions and make sure everyone hears and understands. Have a fail-safe, instantly under-WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-85 Effective 12/01/1999stood method of notifying personnel when to evacu- ate. d. Maintain control of the crew during evacuation. e. Be sure no one is left behind. 6.Survival Zone. A natural or cleared area of sufficient size and location to protect fire personnel from expected hazards whileinside a fire shelter. 7.Fire Situation Assessment. a. Conduct continual situation assessment and follow-up, which is essential. b. When structures are involved, remember that structural fire suppression demands training, equipment, and PPEdifferent from that needed in wildland fire suppression. Structures exposed to wildland fire in the urban interface can and should be considered as another fuel type.Forest Service employees shall limit structural fire sup- pression actions to exterior attack to prevent structure fires from spreading to the wildland. Refer to section35.1 and FSM 5130 for further direction. c. Ensure that firefighter safety is not compromised. Do not deviate from established safety practices, such as the 10 Standard Fire Orders, the 18 Watchout Situations, and LCES. d. Post qualified lookouts with adequate communication for crews and in position to see danger points. (1) Establish prearranged warning signals and make them known to all crew members. (2) Focus attention on high-risk situations first. 8.Firefighter Welfare Guidelines. a. Plan for and ensure a 2 to 1 work-to-rest ratio schedule; 1 hour of rest/sleep for every 2 hours of work/travel. b. Do not assign fatigued firefighters. Provide a minimum of 24 consecutive hours of rest in every 14-day assignmentor 48 consecutive hours of rest in every 21-day assign- ment to continuous suppression activity. c. Following a 21-day assignment, provide a minimum of 24 consecutive hours of rest before any new assign- ment.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-86 Effective 12/01/1999 d. Monitor fluid replacement. Adequate fluid intake de- pends upon weather conditions and workload. The sug- gested replacement rate is at least 1 quart (1 liter) offluid per hour. e. Minimize worker exposure to smoke concentrations. Periodically rotate workers from worksites and camplocations with moderate to high smoke levels to rela- tively smoke-free areas. f. Monitor conditions for possible concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and take appropriate action. Heavy concentrations can exist with smoke. The body absorbs CO at a rapid rate for the first hour of exposure, afterwhich the rate drops slightly for the next 4 to 8 hours. It takes 8 hours in an uncontaminated environment to purge CO from the body. Refer to section 39.22b, para-graph 3, for further information. (1) Monitor personnel for symptoms and behavior associated with CO exposure and take appropriateaction when necessary. Refer to exhibit 01. 25.13a - Exhibit 01 - Symptoms of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Exposure Blood CO Level Symptoms Behavior Moderate Possible headache, Increasing impairment of nausea, and increasing alertness, vision fatigue. discrimination, judgment of time,physical coordination. Becomes increasingly complacent. High Headache, fatigue, Above behavior drowsiness, nausea, becomes more acute to vomiting, dizziness, extreme.convulsions, cardiorespiratory difficulty.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-87 Effective 12/01/1999(2) Expect higher CO concentrations in the following: (a) Near an active flame front. (b) In heavy smoke concentrations (inversions, downwind of the fire). (c) During mop-up (prolonged exposure to low- moderate smoke level). (d) In topographic features that concentrate smoke, such as the head of a canyon, ravines, saddles or passes, depressions, or basins. 25.13b - Fatigue Factors. Accident rates increase sharply with fatigue. Be alert for signs of fatigue. Some methods to combat fatigue include: 1. Ensure a high level of fitness by doing job-specific tasks and training before the season begins. 2. Acclimate to temperature and altitude extremes.3. Limit shifts. 4. Alternate tools/tasks. 5. Set a reasonable work pace and allow adequate rest breaks while on the fireline. 6. Supply sufficient nutrition and water on the line and in camp. 7. Provide showers and comfortable eating areas. 8. Provide quiet, shaded sleeping areas away from smoke, noise, and dust. 9. Post signs and rope off sleeping areas. 10. Practice relaxation and meditation techniques. 25.13c - After Work Activities Involving Swimming. Organized swimming activities must be approved by the Incident Com- mander. If organized swimming is allowed: 1.Prepare a plan for water rescue to respond and deal immediately with accidents; a JHA or equivalent may serve as documentation.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 20-88 Effective 12/01/1999 2. Ensure that a competent person inspects swimming areas for treacherous currents, deep holes, or other hazards. Keep them free of debris and rocks. 3. Designate a person, qualified in water safety, to supervise the activity. a. Assign lifeguards whenever there are swimmers in the water. Have a lookout observing all swimmers all the time. Use a buddy system; no one shall enter the water alone. The swimming area must be equipped with strate-gically placed life saving equipment, such as reaching- poles, lines, and ring-buoys. b. Do not swim if you are overheated.c. Recognize the symptoms of exhaustion and know what to do. d. Know what to do for cramps, which can be caused by cold water. e.

Select a ladder that meets applicable OSHA/ ANSI standards and is right for the job. 33.11a - Prior to Use. Inspect ladders for defects before use each day and after any occurrence that could damage the ladder. Inspect and test any ladder that has been accidentally dropped, exposed to heat, or otherwise damaged. Consider designating a qualifiedinspector to check all ladders at a centralized storage area on a regular basis. The following are examples of what to look for: 1. Evidence of makeshift repairs, such as tape or wire.2. Grease, oil, or burns from welding on the rungs and rails. Never paint a ladder; painting covers structural defects. 3. Condition of ladder feet and all hardware needed for cou- pling extensions. Carefully check all metal fittings. 4. Ladders that have developed defects. Defective ladders must be withdrawn from service for repair or destruction andmarked as \"DANGEROUS, DO NOT USE.\" 5. Loose or cracked rungs and split rails on wood ladders. Wood ladders must be free of splinters and must have smoothedges. Periodically treat wood ladders with clear preservative, such as varnish, shellac, or linseed oil. Never treat rungs with a preser- vative that becomes slippery when wet. 6. Wear, corrosion, and structural failure on metal ladders. Metal ladders are electrical conductors and shall not be used around electrical circuits or for electrical arc welding operations. 33.11b - Use. 1. Ladders are meant for one person only. a. Never overload ladders.b. Never apply a side load or push or pull anything while on a ladder. c. Never drop or apply an impact load to ladder.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 30-14 Effective 12/01/1999 2. Avoid dangerous overreaching. Move the ladder to a new location when you must lean more than 1 foot (1/3 m) to the side. 3. Never \"walk\" a ladder (stilt fashion) while standing on it.4. Set the ladder on firm, level ground. Use nonskid ladder feet for added safety, especially when working on ice or snow. For proper set up: a.Step Type. (1) Ensure that the ladder is fully opened and locked, with the pail shelf in position. (2) Make sure nuts and bolts are tight, steps and rungs are secure and clear of slippery material or loose items, and lock braces and pail workshelf properly. b.Extension Type. Make sure ladder extension locks work as intended. Ensure that rope and other accessories are properly affixed and in good condition.(1) Ensure that the distance from the ladder base to the vertical support equals one-quarter of the ladder's working length. (2) Erect the ladder at about a 75 o angle from the ground line, with a minimum of 3 feet (1 m) extend- ing above the roofline. (3) Raise the ladder to vertical and stand to one side. Hold the rope with one hand and the far rail with the other hand. Raise two or three rungs at a time untilthe proper height is acquired. Adjust the ladder length only when it is unoccupied. Never use tem- porary supports to increase length or to adjust foruneven surfaces. Do not fasten different ladders together to increase length. Apply these rules for overlap (ex. 01). (4) If repeated climbing or long use is planned or if the ladder is leaned against a pole, tree trunk, or post, secure the top of the ladder to a support point withrope, chain, or angle brace. 5. Never: a. Step, stand, or sit on the ladder top, braces, or back section. b. Straddle the top or stand on the top two steps of lad- ders.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 30-15Effective 12/01/1999c.Use a ladder where strenuous action by the worker is required. d.Use a ladder as a platform, plank, hoist, or scaffold. e.Use a ladder on a scaffold or during high winds. f.Place a ladder in front of door openings. 6.Keep rungs free of grease, oil, and other materials that might destroy nonslip surfaces. 7.Discourage use of makeshift ladders unless they clearly meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1926.450. 33.11c - Climbing. 1.Securely engage ladder locks; spread braces before climbing. 2.Ensure that ladder feet are firmly supported. Have a person on the ground firmly hold the ladder to prevent slipping, or secure a board to the floor against which the foot of the ladder can rest. 3.Always face the ladder when ascending or descending; use both hands.33.11b - Exhibit 01 - Two-Section Extension Ladder Minimum Overlap Normal length of ladder (feet) Up to and including 36 Over 36, up to and including 48 Over 48, up to 60Overlap (feet) 3 4 5WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 30-16 Effective 12/01/1999 4. Do not step from one ladder to another. 5. Do not climb above the third rung from the top of an exten- sion ladder or above the upper support point. 33.11d - Storage. 1. Protect ladders from inclement weather. Store them in a dry location, away from excessive heat and possible physical damage. 2. Store ladders vertically. Wooden ladders stored horizontally should be supported at both ends and in the middle to prevent sagging. Sagging tends to loosen the rungs and warp rails. 3. Never store materials on ladders. 4.

Appropriate use of tools and personal protective equipment (PPE). 2. Operating limitations of tools.3. Inspections.4. Adjustments and maintenance (changing heads, bits, blades, handles).WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-6 Effective 12/01/1999 5. Safety features. 6. Care and cleaning. 7. Other items included in the job hazard analysis (JHA) (Form FS-6700-7 or equivalent). 41.11 - Personal Protective Equipment. In the JHA, identify the PPE necessary to protect employees from specific hazards of thework assignment. 41.12 - Procedures. The work supervisor and employees shall prepare a JHA for work projects and activities that involvehandtools. 41.13 - Safety Practices. Because handtools seem easy to use, people often expect them to do more than they were designed todo and frequently use the wrong tool for the job. Using wrenches as hammers and hammers for striking wrenches when working with particularly stubborn nuts are two typical examples. Observe thefollowing guidelines when selecting and using a tool: 1. Select ergonomically designed tools (weight, size, and type) and consider buying several versions or sizes of the same tool. Useeach tool only for the job it was designed to do. 2. Keep jaw teeth, cutters, and blades sharp for better results. Sharp tools improve accuracy, lower fatigue, and lessen the risk ofaccident and injury. Inspect handtools for distortion, cracks, chips, wear, or mushrooming. 3. Keep all tools clean and in working order. Protect them against corrosion damage. Wipe off accumulated grease and dirt. Lubricate moving and adjustable parts to prevent wear and mis- alignment. 4. Keep handles tight; secure them with wedges when neces- sary. Inspect wood handles for splitting, cracking, checking, warp- ing, and slivers. Do not use a tool with a loose or damaged handle. 5. Before using a tool near electricity, shut off the current in near-by circuits.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-7 Effective 12/01/19996. In the presence of flammable materials or explosive dusts and vapors, use nonsparking tools. Do not expose tools to exces- sive heat or use urethane-coated tools in excessive temperatures. 7. Never throw tools under any circumstances. a. When a tool is not in use, shield any sharp edges and place the tool in a predetermined location, away frompersonnel. When transporting tools to and from the job site, ensure that sharp edges are guarded. b. Never transport loose tools inside the same compart- ment with employees unless the vehicle is equipped with a protective screen, net, or secured stationary toolbox. 8. Discard or repair damaged or abused tools promptly. Tem- porary and makeshift repairs are prohibited. If tools cannot be repaired on site, return them to the tool room for repairs or replace- ment. Separate tools needing repair from broken or worn out tools. 9. Discard a tool instead of repairing it by welding or brazing. 10. Provide suitable storage racks and bins for tools needing repair or maintenance. 41.2 - Chopping Tools. Chopping tools include axes, adzes, brush hooks, hatchets, machetes, and pulaskis. 41.21 - Safety Practices. Follow these basic safety practices for maintenance and use. 1. Instruct employees in proper chopping techniques and tool sharpening. a. When grinding, grind slowly toward the cutting edge, taper properly, avoid overheating, and use a file and stone to remove burrs or rough spots. b. When filing, secure work in a clamp or vise. Stroke the file across the edge. Finish the edge with a hand stone. Wear gloves and use a file equipped with a handle andknuckle guard (ex. 01). c. Replace and discard axes, pulaskis, and hatchets that are excessively round-cornered. Check against standardtemplates. Inspect for loose or cracked heads and split, crooked, warped, or splintered handles.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-8 Effective 12/01/1999 2. Carry a chopping tool by grasping around the shoulder of the handle close to the tool head. Hold the tool so that the flatsurface of the blade is vertical (parallel to your leg), with the arm hanging naturally at one's side. Never carry a chopping tool on your shoulder. Carry the tool on the downhill side so that it can be moreeasily discarded in case of a fall. 3. Always remove branches, underbrush, or debris that might interfere with chopping. Follow these general rules: a. Do not allow people to stand in the chopping area, and alert other workers of the distance chopped materials may fly. b. Protect all workers against flying chips and other chop- ping hazards by wearing appropriate PPE. c. Remove all overhead obstructions the tool might strike or hang up in. Always position your body securely while working with a tool.41.21 - Exhibit 01 - Tool Sharpening Protective Shield GlovesFile HandleWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-9 Effective 12/01/1999d. Never chop cross-handed; always use a natural striking action. e. Be alert when working on hillsides or uneven ground.f. Be especially watchful for spring loading, if cutting a sapling that is bound down. Be alert for sudden break- age. If there is not a need to cut it, leave it. g. Standing on a log to chop is not recommended. There are exceptions, exercise caution in such situations. h. Never use chopping tools as wedges or mauls.i. Do not allow two people to chop together on the same tree. j. When chopping limbs from a felled tree, stand on the opposite side of the log from the limb being chopped and swing toward the top of the tree or branch. k. Do not allow the tool handle to drop below a plane that is parallel with the ground unless chopping on the opposite side of a tree from where your body is positioned. l. If the cutting edge picks up a wood chip, stop. Remove the chip before continuing. m. To prevent glancing, keep the striking angle of the tool head almost perpendicular to the tree trunk. n. Use special foot and shin/leg protection if needed. 41.3 - Cutting Tools. Cutting tools include saws, knives, chisels, files, shears, and snips. 41.31 - Safety Practices. Follow these basic guidelines for mainte- nance and use: 1. General Guidelines. Cutting tools must be handled with extra care. Do not store them with other tools in a drawer where someone could be cut accidentally by inadvertently grabbing a sharp edge. Wear safety goggles or other appropriate eye/face protection and gloves when working with cutting tools. Always select the right size and type of tool for the work project or activity. The nuts and bolts on tools, such as shears and snips, require frequent adjustment. Wipe the edges of cutting tools frequently with a lightly oiled rag. Never hit a cutting tool with a striking tool.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-10 Effective 12/01/1999 2.Handsaws. Keep saw teeth sharp and properly set. Protect saw teeth with a sheath/guard when not in use. Consider the shape and correct teeth for the material to be cut. Examine materials being cut for nails, knots, and other objects that may damage the saw or cause the saw to buckle. Hold pieces being cut firmly in place. If long pieces are being cut, use a sup-porting bench to prevent pinching at the cut. Hold the saw firmly and begin slowly to avoid jumping the blade. Pull upward until the blade bites. Start with a partial cut; then setthe saw at the proper angle. a.Bow Saws. Specific techniques include: (1) When inserting a blade in a bow-saw frame, keep your hands and fingers in the clear when the ten- sion lever snaps into or against the saw frame. (2) When removing a bow-saw blade from the frame, ensure that the blade guard is in place. (3) Carry a bow saw over your shoulder with the guarded blade to the rear and on the downhill sidewhen applicable. Ensure the cutting edge faces away from your body, even when the guard is in place. (4) Do not push or force the saw. Begin with light gentle strokes until the teeth begin forming a kerf. b.Crosscut Saws. Refer to section 22.48h for direction. c.Hacksaws. Specific techniques include: (1) Select the proper blade for the material being cut. (2) Point the blade teeth forward. Always keep the blade taut and the frame properly aligned. (3) Use strong, steady strokes, directed away from your body. Use the entire length of the blade in astroke. Cut hard materials more slowly than soft materials. (4) Do not cut thin, flat pieces from edge to edge, always clamp them securely and cut so that several teeth are cutting at all times. 3.Knives. Specific techniques include: a. Keep handles in place and cutting edges sharp and free of nicks.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-11 Effective 12/01/1999b. When using drawknives, place material at working height, firmly anchor it, and hold it steady. Do not use a drawknife on material being braced by a worker's knees.(1) When possible, use pocket knives that lock open. (2) Keep your fingers away from the knife's edge as you close it. 4.Chisels/Punches. Specific techniques include: a. Select the proper hammer for striking. When striking a chisel, punch, or wedge, the hammer's striking faceshould have a diameter approximately 3/8 inch (9-1/2 mm) larger than the face of the tool being struck. b. Select a wood chisel large enough for the job and drive it with a wooden or rubber maul of sufficient weight. Use the proper chisel for the material being cut. c. For striking metal chisels and punches, select a ball peen hammer of the proper size. d. Hold chisels near the top with a steady but relaxed grip. Keep your eyes on cutting edge of the chisel. e. Wear goggles when chipping. Always chip away from yourself, and inform others in the work area of the haz- ards associated with chipping. Provide bystanders witheye protection with side shields. f. Repair or replace mushroomed chisels, and discard broken or cracked chisel handles. When sharpening achisel, maintain its original shape and angle. g. Never use a brick chisel on metal. h. Never use a screwdriver as a cold chisel or punch.i. Punches must be straight and heavy enough for the work. Keep them accurately ground at all times. j. Start punches with light taps. Hold them securely, espe- cially on rounded surfaces. When knocking out rivets and pins, begin with a starting punch; finish with a pin punch. k. Never use a punch with a mushroomed face or a chipped or deformed point. 5.Files. Specific techniques include: a. Equip files with properly sized handles and knuckle guards, and wear cut-resistant (or leather) gloves when using files.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-12 Effective 12/01/1999 b. Tap the file into the handle by striking the handle end on a flat surface. Do not drive the handle onto the file with a hammer. c. Keep the file free of oil, grease, and shavings. Discard dull files or files with hard spots. d. Use the correct type of file for the work. Cut on the forward pass of the file only; do not file backwards. When filing small objects, clamp the material securely in a vise or clamp with sufficient pressure. 41.4 - Storage. Toolboxes, chests, and cabinets may seem safe, but improper use can lead to serious accidents resulting in injuries. Always ensure that all drawers are closed. Overhead drawers are unsafe and can cause the unit to suddenly tumble over onto the user. 41.41 - Safety Practices. Toolbox guidelines include: 1. Select a toolbox that is compatible with the intended use. a. The design of the toolbox shall: (1) Allow for storage, removal, and transportation of tools efficiently and without damage. (2) Include carrying handles for easy moving. 2. Limit the size of a portable toolbox so that it can be easily handled and secured in position on a vehicle. 3. Keep toolbox lids and edges free of rough, sharp edges and surfaces. 4. Never use a toolbox as a ladder or as an anvil. 5. Never walk backward while pulling a toolbox with wheels. 42 - OTHER TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT. To eliminate accidents and injuries resulting from careless and improper handtool use, train employees in tool use and enforce safety rules. 42.01 - Authority. The authority for handling materials, slings, and portable tools and equipment is in Title 29, Code of Federal Regu- lations (29 CFR), sections Page 40-13 Effective 12/01/1999The authority for storage, rigging equipment for material handling, wedges, jacks, and hoists is in 29 1926.305, and 1926.552 - 1926.554. 42.1 Safety Practices. these basic guidelines for mainte- nance and use: 1.Pry, Digging, and Tamping Bars. a. Wear appropriate PPE, such as eye/face protection, foot protection, gloves, and hardhat. b. Transport bars separated from people and secured from movement. c. Secure fulcrums and toeholds. When prying, push with your palms. When applying leverage, keep your feet andother parts of your body out of line with the bar. d. When breaking, chipping, or prying rock or similar mate- rials, ensure that other people are not within the strikingdistance of flying particles. e. Carry bars at their balance point and on the downhill side. f. Lay the bar flat and in the clear when not in use. g. Maintain bars by keeping them straight. Sharpen the tip to retain the factory bevel. h. Replace bent or twisted bars. Bent or twisted bars can rotate during use and strike the user. i. Store bars so that they do not present a tip-over or falling hazard. 2.Grubbing Tools. Such tools include grub hoes, mattocks, picks, pulaskis, combination tools, McLeods, and various types ofhoes. a. Instruct employees in the use and maintenance of grub- bing tools. b. Keep the blade eye tight-fitting and secured. Repair or replace defective or excessively worn tools immediately. c. When working, ensure secure footing. Maintain a tight grip on the handle, and keep legs and feet in the clear when swinging. Avoid directing the tool toward the body. Keep the tool out in front. Use gentle but deliberateswinging or hoeing action. d. Do not allow people to stand in the chopping, grubbing, or hoeing area. Alert other workers of the distance thatWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-14 Effective 12/01/1999 debris may fly. Watch for rocks or objects that will cause the tool to glance, rebound, or create excessive flying material. e. Maintain 10 feet (3 m) minimum between people when they are walking or working. f. Remove all overhead obstructions the tool might strike or hang up in. 3.Wrenches. Generally, the safest wrench is a box or socket type. Open end, flare nut, and adjustable wrenches are not asstrong as the corresponding sizes of box or socket wrenches and are not intended for heavy loads, such as breaking loose frozen fasteners or final tightening. If the wrench is not the correct size forthe fastener, it is likely to damage the corners of the fastener, slip or break and cause an injury. a. Use tools with insulated handles for electrical work.b. Select the correct size and type of wrench for each job. Do not extend the wrench handle with pipe or other \"cheater bar\" to add leverage. c. Never use a wrench as a hammer. Never use pipe or Stilson wrenches as monkey wrenches. d. Whenever possible, pull rather than push a wrench handle. Pull it toward you at right angles. Adjustable wrenches should be tightly adjusted to the nut and pulled in such a manner that the force is on the side ofthe fixed jaw. e. Never use a wrench on material or machinery in motion. Do not position hands so that they can be jammedagainst other objects if a wrench slips. f. Replace and discard wrenches when the jaws are sprung. g. Keep jaw corrugations on Stilson wrenches sharp and clean. h. Keep handles and adjusting screws on all wrenches in good condition. 4.Hammers. Hammers are one of the most widely used type of handtool and one of the most often abused. More than twodozen styles of hammers are manufactured in various types, sizes, and configurations for very specific purposes. It is essential forWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-15 Effective 12/01/1999safety and efficiency to select the proper hammer for the specific work project or activity. a. Ball peen hammers of the proper size are designed for striking metal chisels and punches and for riveting, shaping, and striking unhardened metal. b. Always use a wood or rubber maul of sufficient weight with wood-handle chisels. Ensure that handles are not cracked. c. Hold nails being driven just under the head and not at the base. d. Never use a nail hammer to strike a nail-puller bar. e. When driving a large bar or post requiring assistance, have the helper hold the object with tongs. f. Use a maul tempered harder than the object being struck. 5.Pliers. Pliers are designed and manufactured to perform specific functions; pliers are not wrenches, and they should not be used to turn nuts or bolts. a. Do not use pliers in place of a wrench. b. Discard pliers if they have chipped or dulled cutting edges. c. Use specifically manufactured pliers to cut hardened wire. d. Always cut at right angles.e. Do not rock pliers from side to side or bend the wire back and forth against the cutting edges. f. Do not use pliers as a substitute for a hammer.g. Pliers with plastic coated handles are not designed to provide electrical protection. 6.Screwdrivers. Screwdrivers come in many sizes and shapes and are to be used only for driving and withdrawing threaded fasteners. Suggested safety practices include: a. Have a proper assortment of screwdrivers on hand.b. Select a properly fitted screwdriver; the blade will make a snug fit. c. Select a handle design that provides both comfort and proper leverage. Plastic and other handle coatings are for comfort only. They do not provide protection when working around electricity.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-16 Effective 12/01/1999 d. Use the appropriate PPE for the work to be performed. e. Do not use a screwdriver at eye level when directing pressure upward. f. Always be prepared to respond should the screwdriver slip. g. Exercise caution when working overhead and/or on a ladder. 7.Vises. Vises come in many sizes and shapes and are manufactured to hold specific types of work. A vise with bolt holesmust be bolted, not screwed, to a bench. A vise that is loose at its base, or with its jaws clamped too loosely on the work, can cause accidents and injury. A vise with overtightened jaws can crush ordamage the work. Proper pressure must be applied. a. Use arm power only to close the jaws of a vise. Do not use an extension or a \"cheater\" over the handle totighten jaws. b. Do not use a hammer to force the handle tighter. c. For a safe, secure hold, do the work as close to the vise jaws as possible. d. Support long overhanging work at the far end with a saw horse or similar device. e. When possible, clamp work centrally in the jaws instead of the corners. Use special jaw inserts for contoured or soft work pieces. 8.Jacks. Employees use various types of jacks, such as lever, ratchet, screw, and hydraulic jacks. a. Select jacks strong enough to hold the load safely and securely. b. See that the manufacturer's rated capacity is legibly marked on all jacks. Never exceed the rated capacity. c. Use only jacks that have a positive stop to prevent over travel. The operator must watch the stop indicator, which has to be kept clean in order to determine the limit oftravel. d. Inspect jacks before using. Tag jacks if they are inoper- able, and do not use them until repairs are made. Followthis inspection timetable and inspect each jack thor- oughly:WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-17 Effective 12/01/1999(1) For constant or intermittent use at one locality: at least once every 6 months. (2) For jacks sent out of the shop for special work: when sent out and when returned. (3) For a jack subjected to abnormal load or shock: immediately before and immediately after use. e. Lubricate jacks at regular intervals according to manufacturer's specifications or at least twice a year. Store them away from moisture. f. Supply hydraulic jacks exposed to freezing temperatures with an adequate antifreeze liquid. g. Always place the base of the jack on a level, firm foun- dation. When using cup-provided jacks, if there is a possibility of cup slippage, place a block between the cup and the load. Center the load to prevent tipping. h. Chock or block and secure vehicles before raising them. i. After the load has been raised, crib, block, or otherwise secure it at once. j. Shore any load that must remain raised in a position for any length of time. k.Securely block the load up on jack stands before someone gets under an object supported by a jack or hoist. l.Never get under a load supported by a jack unless the object is securely blocked on jack stands or on other approved support that's designed for the load. m. Tag any jack that is out of order. Do not use it until it is repaired. Replace jacks not easily repaired. 9.High-lift Jacks. High-lift jacks, such as the \"handyman\" jack, if misused or not maintained correctly, are potentially hazard-ous (refer to the Glossary). a. Always follow the manufacturer's suggested operation, safety, and maintenance instructions. b. Conduct training sessions to demonstrate the safe use of jacks. c. Review the conditions under which specific jacks may be used and ensure that operators are trained to use them properly. d. Never stand directly in front of a high-lift jack.WO Amendment important to select the appro- priate handtrucks for the specific load to be moved or for the work project to be performed. Consider the following: a. Load-carrying capacity, strength of frame, leverage, and nose plate for stability. b. Handle configuration and type (single, double, continu- ous, integral, or a combination). c. Ergonomic design to allow the load balance point to move easily over the wheels, reducing break-over effort. d. Rear casters that support the weight of the load to help keep the load balanced; also casters that swivel to reduce the effort of maneuvering. e. Specially designed heavy-duty appliance handtrucks with auto-rewind ratchet tighteners and retractable 01 - Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-19 Effective 12/01/1999f. Proper handtruck operation: (1) Follow the manufacturer's operating instructions and do not exceed load-carrying capacities. (2) Before moving forward, make sure the path is smooth and clear. Bumps or obstacles can cause the load to fall. (3) Make sure that the load does not block your vision. Keep the load secure and well-balanced. (4) When moving a single large object, strap it securely to the frame. (5) Ensure that wheels are secured to the frame and that the frame is straight and in good repair. (6) Do not allow riding on a handtruck or any other horseplay involving a handtruck. (7) Keep your feet away from moving handtruck wheels; position your hands and fingers away from pinch points. (8) When possible, push instead of pull.(9) Slow down at blind corners and intersections. (10) Where provided, use wide-angle convex and/or panoramic dome mirrors at intersections and cor-ners for increased visibility. (11) Store handtrucks clear of aisles, passageways, stairways, general traffic, and exits. 11.Hoists. Hoists shall meet the applicable requirements for construction, design, installation, testing, inspection, maintenance, and operation, as prescribed by the manufacturer. a. Select the appropriate hoist for the load by referring to the manufacturer's determined workload capacity as indicated on the hoist. Mark the hoist body or hook withthe rated load capacity, recommended speed, and spe- cial hazard warnings. b. Never let the hoist capacities exceed structure or build- ing capacities. Use overhead support and rigging strong enough to carry maximum loads with a safety factor of 2-1/2 to 1 (that is 2-1/2 times stronger than the maxi-mum load they are rated to carry). c. Inspect running gear, hooks, straps, and chains for cracks and other signs of fatigue to make sure they willnot slip or give way under stress.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-20 Effective 12/01/1999 d. Ensure that hook openings do not exceed 15 percent of the original hook gap throat (opening) or more than a 10- degree twist from the plane of the unbent hook. f. Ensure that hoists are securely anchored. g. Guide heavy loads with ropes rather than by hand. h. Side-pull the chain hoist only when the superstructure is braced to withstand lateral stress. i. Engage the ratchet pawl when lifting or suspending loads. Remove the crank when the load is suspended. j. Use only crank handles with a free-floating grip. k. Ensure that all hooks meet the manufacturer's recom- mendations and are not overloaded. l. Whenever possible, use safety latch type hooks. 12.Peaveys, Cant Hooks, and Pike Poles. a. Handles must be free of splinters, splits, and cracks.b. Keep points sharp. c. Keep your body balanced when pushing/pulling the pole. d. Grip the handle firmly. Do not overstress the handle.e. Place guards on points when the tool is not in use or is being transported. 13.Shovels. a. Keep shovels sharp and replace them if they show cracks, ragged edges, or splits. Follow sharpening guides carefully. Never sharpen cutting edges all the wayto the foot plate. b. Never use a shovel as a pry bar. c. When shoveling, support your upper body by bracing the forearm closest to your body against your thigh as you pivot the blade sideways. d. Check handles for splits, cracks, and slivers before using. Replace defective handles. 14.Wheelbarrows. a. Select the appropriate wheelbarrow for the job, with a strong, straight frame and strong wheels that are well secured to the frame. b. Keep your back straight and use your legs when lifting the handles of a loaded wheelbarrow. Never overload a wheelbarrow; keep the load evenly balanced, with weightWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-21 Effective 12/01/1999well forward to avoid lifting strain. Push, do not pull, wheelbarrows. c. Keep handles free of splinters, jagged edges, and burrs. Remove cracked or broken handles from service. d. Watch for obstacles that will stop or tip a wheelbarrow. Do not run with a wheelbarrow. Check the route beforemoving the wheelbarrow. (1) Allow enough clearance to avoid injuring fingers and hands. (2) Exercise caution when ascending or descending ramps that may be wet, frosted, or snow covered. 15.Wedges. a. Select the correct wedge(s) for the job. The proper type, size, length, and combination are essential for efficiency and safety. b. Check wedges daily or before each job, and do not use cracked or flawed wedges. c. Wear a hardhat, eye or face protection, and gloves when driving wedges. d. Carry wedges in an appropriate belt or other container, not in pockets of clothing. e. Always drive wedges by striking them squarely on the head and driving them carefully into the cut to prevent them from flying out of the cut or kerf. f. Repair or remove from service any shock-driven or driving tool when the head begins to chip or mushroom. g. Recondition heads and the tapered ends of wedges to the manufacturer's original shape and angle. Wear eye protection and a dust mask when grinding to recondition wedges. 42.2 - Rigging Equipment for Material Handling. This section covers the use of fiber, synthetic, and wire ropes for lifting and structural support. 42.21 - Safety Practices. Follow these basic guidelines: 1.General Guidelines. a. Inspect ropes and related equipment before each shift. Replace cracked hubs, spokes, flanges or sheaves, winches, and blocks. Discard hooks, shackles, rings,WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-22 Effective 12/01/1999 and slings that are bent, spread, or otherwise damaged. Continue to monitor ropes during use for broken strands, cuts, and worn or frayed spots. Immediately remove fromservice any defective rigging equipment. b. Ensure that only a qualified splicer makes splices. Never use knots in lieu of splices. Ensure only qualified per-sons tie knots for tie-downs and loads. Match the type of knot to the purpose. c. Carefully match the rope and the job: (1) Use manila ropes preferably on rigging and other jobs where tight bends and sharp corners occur. (2) Never use synthetic ropes where stretching causes problems. (3) Use wire ropes for running or working ropes under heavy loads; for hoisting where slings and hardwareare provided; and for permanent guy wires and structured tension members. (Use chains when hooks, ratchets, and other holding devices areused.) (4) Never exceed the rigging equipment's recom- mended safe working load. Refer to 29 CFR1910.184 and 29 CFR 1926.251 for specific rated capacities of rigging equipment. (5) Always remove rigging equipment in the immediate work area when it is not in use so as not to present a hazard to workers. 2.Natural Rope and Synthetic Fiber. a. Never overload rope. b. Uncoil new natural fiber rope from the inside of the spool. Uncoil new synthetic rope by rolling the rope offthe spool as it spins on an axle or spindle. c. Never drag rope over rough or sharp surfaces. d. Keep acids and acid fumes away from ropes.e. Thoroughly dry rope after use. Coil and pile or suspend rope so air can circulate through the coils. Never pile frozen or wet rope against heat sources. When wet,natural fiber ropes are never as strong as dry ones, and wet synthetic ropes are slippery and may not hold knots well.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-23 Effective 12/01/1999f. Store synthetic ropes away from sunlight, oil, and any other petroleum products that may cause deterioration. 3.Wire Rope. Consult the unit engineer and/or tables for wire rope strength; requirements for proper use of wire rope are in 29 CFR 1910.184 and 29 CFR 1926.251. Serious accidents have resulted from improper handling of wire ropes and installation ofwire rope clamps. a. Wear cotton gloves while handling wire ropes. b. Apply a safety factor of not less than 5, and never let the working load of a wire rope exceed 1/5 of its breaking strength. c. Do not let wire rope kink when unwinding it from ship- ping reels. A common cause of wire rope failure is kink- ing, which usually occurs when it is unwound from shipping reels. d. Never allow wire rope to overwrap unevenly on drums. e. Always use the proper size clamps. Inspect clamp nuts daily when rope is in use and tighten them often. Re-tighten newly installed nuts or slips after 1 hour of use. f. When used for eye splices, apply the U-bolt so that the U section is in contact with the dead end of the wirerope (ex. 01). g. Remove wire rope from service when the total number of visible broken wires exceeds 10 percent of the totalnumber of wires, or if the rope shows other signs of excessive wear, corrosion, or defect. 42.21 - Exhibit 01 - Proper Installation of Wire Rope Clamp Correct Way U-bolt of all clips on dead end of rope\"U\" Section Dead EndWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-24 Effective 12/01/1999 h. Maintain the safety of wire rope by lubricating it regularly to protect against corrosion and excessive wear. Be sure the lubricant penetrates to inner wires. 42.3 - Chains. 42.31 - Safety Practices. 1. Consult an engineer when selecting chains.2. Inspect chains for small cracks, corrosion, and pits, and for deformed, stretched, weak, or gouged links. If a chain is defective, repair or replace it. Dispose of unserviceable chain. 3. Do not splice broken chain with clamps or bolts. 4. Do not use shop hooks and links or makeshift fasteners formed from bolts, rods, or other such attachments. 5. Ensure that hooks, rings, oblong links, pear-shaped links, welded or mechanical coupling links, or other attachments, when used with alloy steel chains, have a rated capacity at least equal tothat of the chain. 6. Do not subject chains to impact loads or jerking. 7. When hooking chain, ensure that the hook is completely over the link, so the chain cannot slip and the hook will not bend. The hook must be as far from the load as possible, so the pull is on the back of the hook. Ensure that a straight pull is made. The hookopening must be away from the object being pulled or lifted. 8. After hitching or hooking chains to a load, stand far enough away to avoid being hit by a broken chain, the load, or flying partsor pieces. 42.4 - Slings. 42.41 - Safety Practices. 1. Each day before use have a competent person inspect the sling and all fastenings and attachments for damage or defects.

Test brake systems daily to ensure that they are fully functional and properly adjusted. d. Keep battery fluids at the manufacturer's specified lev- els. Do not expose batteries to excessive heat or cold or store them in direct sunlight. e. Do not operate tractors if any part of the control, hoist, or hydraulic system, including steering, brakes, and safety equipment, is not functional. f. If a tractor is determined unsafe, take it out of service until repairs are completed. g. Make proper blade or other machine accessory adjust- ments before starting operation. Check the condition ofcutting edges regularly. h. If the noise level of the machine is 85 dB or above, provide the operator (and trainee when on the machine)with hearing protection in addition to other required PPE. i. Wear seatbelts on equipment that has rollover protec- tion. j. Do not operate a crawler-tractor on any cross- or down- slope that is greater than the maximum slope recom- mended by the manufacturer, JHA, Driver-OperatorGuide, or this Handbook. k. To operate on a maximum slope, maintain full con- trol of the machine, recognizing the following condi- tions that may upset tractor stability: (1) Speed of travel.(2) Roughness of terrain.(3) Attachments. (4) Characteristics and nature of the ground. l. If danger exists from trees or snags because of the specific task, position helpers at least 2-1/2 times the distance of the height of the tallest tree(s) from the tractor. m. Maintain a distance of greater than 2-1/2 tree lengths between adjacent occupied work areas on any slope where rolling or sliding of trees or snags is reasonablyforeseeable. n. Consider any overhead wire energized unless the power company verifies otherwise.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-48 Effective 12/01/1999 o. Block or crib any parts held by a hoist or jacks, to pre- vent falling or shifting, before employees are permitted to work under or between them. p.Never get under an unblocked, raised blade for any purpose. q. When the machine is shut down or unattended, always set the brakes and lower dozer blades, buckets, rippers, or similar accessories to the ground. r. Have a journeyman-level mechanic inspect all equip- ment annually. s. When operating a tractor: (1)Look over the ground to be traveled. If it cannot be clearly seen from the driver's seat, dismount and examine it before proceeding, unless you have a qualified spotter. (2) Use caution around overhanging rocks, on rock slides, and near dead trees and materials that may be dislodged from the slope above. (3)Use extreme caution in going over obstacles when headed downhill. (4) Reduce speed before making a turn or applying brakes. If the speed of a tractor is doubled, the danger of overturning is increased four times. (5) Make turns on the uphill side if possible.(6) On steep sideslopes, avoid running over hazards, such as rocks, stumps, and logs, with a single track or wheel. Beware of wet or frozen downed logs anddebris. (7) When operating a towing winch, keep your hands free from the cable and moving/working parts. (8) Guard against slough and settling at the edge of new fills. 2.Hitching and Towing. a. Never put your hands into drawbar jaws when hitching or coupling. Use a bar to steer the coupler into position before dropping the pin into place. b. When coupling a tractor to other units, make sure work- ers stand clear of the area between units until all move- ment has stopped.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-49 Effective 12/01/1999c. Look behind you before backing up to slack the chain or cable. Take up slack gently, never with a jerk. d. Make sure everyone stands clear of all chains and lines and remains at least the length of the towline from the tractor. e. Do not ride on the drawbar, dozer blade, frame, or mate- rials being pulled by a tractor. f. When towing near a powerline, ensure that the cable is at least 10 feet (3 m) shorter than the distance from thetractor to the powerline. g. Operate the tractor so that it does not nose-up or tip when pulling a heavy load or slide sideways when pulling side-hill. h. Before releasing the load, release the tension on the cables or chains, stop the tractor, take the transmissionout of gear, and set the brake. i. After each work shift or after each hard haul, ensure that the tractor operator and towline setter inspect the equip-ment, including the wire rope and eye splices on the winch, chokers, and ferrules. 3.Skidding: a. Equip crawler-tractors used in timbered country or in places where there is a danger of falling objects with protective canopies, approved roll-over protective struc-tures (ROPS), falling-object protective structures (FOPS), and mesh screens. b. Always assess the work area for hazards, such as dan- ger trees and snags, green trees, hung trees, broken tops, widow makers, stumps, and uprooted trees. Also, consider the tree species. c. Have the operator and towline/choker setters specifically address safe work practices and work in proximity to the heavy equipment. d. Have the machine operator and towline/choker setters establish a communication system that identifies when the setter is clear of the immediate hazards and the loadis to be moved. e. In addition to the required PPE, ensure that towline/ choker setters wear high-visibility vests and appropriateWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-50 Effective 12/01/1999 hand protection (such as cotton or leather-faced gloves) for handling wire rope. f. Require operators and towline/choker setters to inspect equipment, including main tow winch, main line, wire ropes, chokers, splices, and ferrules, each morning and during the day as necessary. g. Use hand signals or audible signals, such as whistles, horns, and radios, whenever noise, distance, restricted visibility, or other factors prevent clear understanding ofnormal voice communications between employees. h. Space employees and organize their duties so the action of one employee does not create a hazard for others. 44.22 - Scrapers. 44.22a - Safety Practices. Follow these general safety guidelines: 1. Before each work shift, safety inspect all equipment.2. In addition to wearing the required PPE, wear cotton or leather-faced gloves to handle wire rope. Use waterproof, nonslip gloves in wet conditions. 3. Keep hands away from wire rope, sheaves, and linkage while the unit is operating. 4. To prevent a scraper from slipping off the edge of a fill, keep the center of the fill low and the outside edges high. 5. Leave the machine in gear and use the brakes to control speed. Provide a service braking system capable of stopping andholding the equipment when fully loaded. 6. When traveling down a steep hill, be ready to drop the cutting edge to the ground to serve as a brake if the scraper shouldjackknife or otherwise become out of control. 7. Avoid sharp downhill turns and never turn while the scraper is top heavy with the apron in the air. 8. When changing the cutting edges or working underneath a scraper, block up the bowl to prevent falling or shifting. 9. Before working under the apron, place blocks between the apron arms and scraper side, and wedge them securely.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-51 Effective 12/01/199944.23 - End Loaders/Backhoes. End loaders/backhoes tip over easily because of their high center of gravity. Operators must be completely familiar with weight distribution and the effects that it has on the center of gravity and machine stability. 44.23a - Safety Practices. Always perform a preventative mainte- nance and walk-around safety inspection of the machine and at-tachments before each day's work or shift change. Follow these general safety guidelines: 1. Operate machine controls only from the operator's seat.2. Equip all loaders with bucket-supported arms pivoted behind the operator with a suitable cage canopy. The cage canopy must make it impossible for the operator to be ex- posed to injury when the bucket is lowered (ex. 01). 3. Fasten seatbelts before starting the engine. 4. Make sure everyone is clear before starting the machine. Keep persons away from the backhoe's swing arc by warning and barricading the area. 44.23a - Exhibit 01 - Safety Cage and Canopy Cage Yellow & BlackWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-52 Effective 12/01/1999 5. Permit no one on the excavator/end loader/backhoe except the operator, operator-trainee, or mechanic. 6. Always have wheels or tracks on firm ground. Do not extend a load over the fill slope(s) or bank(s) beyond the counter-balance and/or center of gravity limits. Remind operators that they should work only at right angles to banks or fills. 7. Pick up loads under the center of their weight and take extra care when working an excavator/end loader downhill. 8. Do not move a machine until it is completely loaded. Start and stop slowly when raising and lowering the bucket and when traveling. 9. When transporting material in the bucket over rough ground or on a hillside, keep the bucket close to ground level. Do not swing a loaded bucket over the cab of a truck. 10. Do not allow anyone to ride in the bucket of any equipment.11. When an end loader is being repaired or not in use, fully lower or block the end loader buckets and attachments, such as a backhoe. 12. Before dismounting an excavator/end loader/backhoe, ensure that the operator turns off the engine, sets the brakes, pulls the transmission safety latch, and grounds the buckets. Shut off theengine before cleaning, adjusting, or lubricating. 13. Before lubricating, cleaning, adjusting, repairing, or tighten- ing hoses, stop the engine, lower the boom, and release the pres-sure. 14. Put the machine in low gear, block the machine wheels securely, and lower the bucket to the ground when the equipment isparked on a grade. 15.

Avoid loose fitting or baggy clothes.2. Immediately change clothing saturated with oil or fuel. 3. Require that visitors wear the same PPE as field workers. 4. If the drilling rig mast is left in the upright position when moving the drill rig truck, walk the length of the route to determineWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-70 Effective 12/01/1999 the presence of electrical hazards or other obstructions. This is a joint responsibility of the immediate supervisor and the driller. a. Do not permit the mast within 10 feet (3 m) of powerlines. b. Use proximity warning devices on drill rigs. 5. Check bridges, road conditions, grade, and overhead clear- ance before moving the drill rig truck over unfamiliar roads. 6. Disengage the winch and drill power-takeoff before putting the truck in motion. a. Secure loose equipment. b. Stay clear of the mast when raising or lowering. c. Chock rig wheels when drilling. 7. Use threaded swivel hoisting plugs. Keep the threads clean and lubricated, and ensure that the air-vent hole is completely into the rod box when used. 8. When using slips, have the right size for the drill rods and keep them clean to ensure a firm grip. a. Replace or repair worn slips; never shim them.b. Never set slips until rods are completely stopped. 9. Keep tool joints clean and lubricated. Replace and repair those showing wear. 10. When picking up or laying down drill rods, have the helper stand clear. When manually rotating a stuck drill rod, set the con- trols on the drill so there is no possibility of the rods' suddenlyraising or lowering when they are freed. 11. Never allow mud to accumulate in the working area. Use a rubber rod wiper to clean the drill stem as it comes from the hole.Spread dry soil over the working area if necessary, or provide a portable wooden or steel work platform to provide safe footing. 12. Keep clutches, brakes, and hydraulic valves and lines in proper adjustment so they cannot inadvertently become engaged. 13. Equip mud pumps with pressure relief valves set to open at not more than the maximum pressure recommended by the manu-facturer.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-71 Effective 12/01/1999a. Use guards on shear-pin type valves to prevent possible injury by the flying pin. b. Direct discharge from these valves toward the ground.c. Before working on the mud pump to replace liners, for example, be sure the pressure is released. 14. Never hold the pipe wrench on the drill rod while using rig down-pressure to force a pipe into the hole. Use a push bar that does not have to be held for this operation. 15. Use deflectors to direct the cuttings away from the drill crew. Cuttings blown from the hole in air drilling can be a hazard. Goggles and respirators are required if dust and cuttings cannot be controlled. a. Never direct the air stream at your body. Gages are required to accurately show the air pressure. Do not test the pressure on your hands or feet. b. Completely release air pressure before breaking any connections. 16. Secure the rotary hose by safety chains attached to the hose by metal clamps, independent of the hose connection clamps. Fasten the lower safety chain to the mast. 17. Ensure that at the source of supply every air drill with hoses exceeding 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) diameter is equipped with a safety device. 45 - EQUIPMENT DEVELOPMENT. 45.01 - Authority. The authority for general equipment develop- ment is contained in FSM 7120, Equipment Development. 45.03 - Policy. Utilize the Technology and Development Centers in a program of development efforts to benefit resource management on the national forests and grasslands. 45.1 - Procedures. Equipment development requires a structured approach from planning and design through implementation and support. A structured approach involves a proven series of steps and tasks that a project team can follow to build or modify qualityequipment safely, faster, and at lower costs.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-72 Effective 12/01/1999 A project team should use the following steps of the Structured Systems Development Life-Cycle Methodology for a systems devel- opment effort. The methodology outlined in the following sectionsdescribes key steps and tasks of a systems development effort. The exact methodology used to develop or maintain a system should be appropriate to the size, type, and scope of the project. The five basic phases of the Structured Systems Development Life- Cycle Methodology include: 1.Conceptual Design. In the concept design phase, manage- ment identifies the need for a system that will enhance the ability of the Forest Service to achieve its business objectives. This phase determines the appropriate systems solution, defines the basicgoals of the system, and defines a project work plan. The project plan outlines the scope, policies, philosophies, responsibilities, guidelines, major milestones, assumptions, and constraints. 2.Planning. The planning phase consists of formulating and formalizing the new system's safety, functionality, quality, and architectural requirements; designing (or modifying) the system tomeet those requirements; and planning for safe development and implementation. Management must identify and assess the critical system specification issues before actual system developmentbegins. 3.Development. The development phase occurs after the initial planning phase ends. This phase includes resolving any userdesign issues and developing the technical, detailed design of each specific program. Once the design is complete, system developers code individual programs, create conversion files, and thoroughlytest the system. In addition, the system is documented and the users are trained. This phase demands constant monitoring from management to control the scope of the project. 4.Implementation. The implementation phase begins during the system test component of the development phase. This phase includes preparing the system for implementation, testing useracceptance, and then implementing the new system. Preparations for implementing the new system can occur at the same time as the system test. Once the users are trained, they can begin theuser acceptance test component of this phase. When the systemWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 40-73 Effective 12/01/1999has been completely tested and accepted, actual implementation can take place. The objective of this phase is to ensure that the system satisfies the stated requirements, and then to provide anenvironment that will ensure the system's continued success. Review of system objectives, requirements, plans, user accep- tance, and sign-off are crucial throughout the implementationphase. 5.Post Implementation/System Support. The post imple- mentation/system support phase occurs after the system has beenimplemented and continues for the life of the system. This phase includes continuous monitoring, maintaining, and modifying of the system to ensure that the system performs as expected, and that itcontinues to meet the user's dynamic needs.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-1 Effective 12/01/1999CHAPTER 50 - EMPLOYEE SAFETY, SECURITY, AND HEALTH Contents 51 EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND SECURITY 51.01 Authority 51.04 Responsibility51.06 References 51.1 Procedures 51.11 Safety Practices51.2 Firearms for Non-Law Enforcement Personnel 51.21 Authorization for Firearms 51.21a Expiration of Firearms Authorization51.21b Employees With Occasional Need To Carry Firearms 51.22 Firearms Training 51.22a Firearms Training Course51.22b Shooting Proficiency 51.23 Use of Firearms 51.23a Privately Owned Firearms51.23b Firearms in Camp 51.24 Firearms and Ammunition Storage 51.3 Aerosol Defensive Sprays51.31 Authorization for Aerosol Defensive Sprays 51.32 Training 51.33 Transportation and Storage51.34 Reporting Procedures 51.35 Restrictions on Aerosol Defensive Sprays 52 EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELLNESS 52.01 Authority 52.06 Reference 52.1 Health Practices52.2 Employee Plan 52.33 Training 52.34 Hepatitis B 52.41 Cumulative Trauma Disorders 52.42 Back Injury 52.43 Neck and Eye Strain 53 PLANT, ANIMAL, AND INSECT HAZARDS 53.01 Authority 53.1 53.22 Chiggers - General Safety Practices53.3 Poisonous Snakes, Spiders, and Scorpions 53.31 Precautions for Working in Snake Country 53.31a First Aid for Snake Bites53.4 Spiders 53.5 Scorpions 53.6 Insect Stings and 53.61a Safety Guidelines 53.61b Africanized Honey Bees53.62 Mosquitoes 53.7 Bears, Mountain Lions, and Other Animals 53.71 Bears53.72 Mountain Lions 53.73 Other Animals and Hazards 53.73a Hantavirus53.73b Rabies 54 ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS 54.01 References54.1 Radiation 54.11 Solar Ultraviolet Radiation 54.2 Extreme Weather Conditions54.21 Working in Hot Conditions 54.22 Working in Cold Frostbite54.22b Procedures Temporary Camp Requirements 55.11a Water Supply55.11b Other Requirements 55.11c Camp Sanitation 55.11d Food Rations 55.12e Water Purification of Undeveloped Sources55.12f After-Work Organized Swimming ActivitiesWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-5 Effective 12/01/1999CHAPTER 50 - EMPLOYEE SAFETY, SECURITY, AND HEALTH 51 - EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND SECURITY.

A high level of physical fitness is essential for enjoying life to the fullest on and off the job . Regular, moderate physical activity permits an active life-style that enhances health,work capacity, and quality of life. Exercise can also minimize problems associated with being overweight, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and a host of physi- ological and sociological problems . Being overweight affects work capacity by placing added stress on the heart and restricting heat loss. 1. Aerobic and muscular exercises that improve endurance and strength have the following benefits to: a. Reduce the risk of heart disease.b. Improve circulation and respiration. c. Minimize fatigue. d. Strengthen bones, ligaments, tendons, and muscles.e. Reduce physical tension and psychological stress. f. Reduce anxiety and depression. g. Enhance self-image and morale. 2. Exercise programs greatly enhance productivity and morale. Supervisors are encouraged to set up such programs in the follow- ing situations: a. For field work crews during the first few weeks of the season. b. For employees who are being required to accomplish new physical tasks. c. For people hired at mid-season to help them better contribute to crew production. d. For employees with past injuries who may be prone to re-injury. e. For all personnel who are or will be involved in wildfire suppression activities. 3. Before assigning field project work or activities to em- ployees who are not normally field personnel, supervisors should consider individual physical fitness, general health, and personal limitations. 4. Warm up exercises and stretching are recommended prior to daily work activity or project.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-15 Effective 12/01/199952.3 - Bloodborne Pathogens Program. 52.31 - Scope of Employee Coverage. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard at 29 CFR 1910.1030covers all employees who could be \"reasonably anticipated,\" as the result of performing their job duties, to come in contact with blood, or any body fluid visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids. (For additional direction, see FSM 6740). 52.32 - Exposure Control Plan. The Forest Service exposure control plan (FSH 6709.12) is designed to protect employees from occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, such as the hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), andother potentially infectious materials, including human body fluids. As part of this plan, managers and supervisors shall determine those employees and those job classifications with occupationalexposure to bloodborne pathogens. Occupational exposure is defined as reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral (a piercing of mucous membrane or skin barrier byneedle sticks, human bites, cuts, and abrasions) contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee's duties. To further minimize employee risk, all employees, regardless of job classification or duties, shall observe Universal Precautions at all times. Universal Precautions is an approach to infection control inwhich human blood and human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, or other bloodborne pathogens. 52.33 - Training. All employees shall receive HIV/AIDS education training. For employees whose jobs put them at risk for an occupa- tional exposure, training shall cover the major elements of the OSHA bloodborne pathogens regulation (29 CFR 1910.1030). 52.34 - Hepatitis B Vaccination. This vaccination shall be made available, at no cost, to all employees who have the potential for occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious mate-rial. The vaccine should be administered within 10 working days of assignment. Employees must sign a declination form if they choose not be vaccinated. The employee may later opt to receive the vac-cine at no cost.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-16 Effective - Post-Exposure Incident Evaluation. Make this evalua- tion available to any exposed employee and include a confidential medical evaluation and the follow-up required by OSHA. 52.4 - Ergonomics. Ergonomic assessments in the workplace can reduce fatigue, discomfort, and potential injury. Minimizing stress, strain, and repetitive motion can prevent injuries and illnesses,such as cumulative trauma disorder (CTD), back injury, and neck and eye strain. 52.41 - Cumulative Trauma Disorders. OSHA defines CTDs as a group of illnesses associated with ongoing damage to soft tissues (muscles, tendons, and nerves) and joints. CTDs include repetitive motion injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, repetitive straininjuries, and musculoskeletal disorders. Three risk factors that can lead to CTDs are repetition, awkward posture/position, and force (excessive pressure on muscles andjoints). 52.42 - Back Injury. Suggested preventive measures include maintaining: 1. A high level of physical fitness. 2. Abdominal tone. 3. Flexibility in the lower back and hamstring muscles.4. Regular, moderate aerobic activity. 5. Good posture and proper mechanics while lifting and carry- ing (sec. 39.64). 6. A routine warm-up schedule of five or ten minutes of stretching and loosening the muscles to reduce muscle tension, improve range of motion, and reduce the chance of muscle strainsor other injuries. 52.43 - Neck and Eye Strain. Steps to avoid neck and eye strain are: 1. Provide good general illumination and specific task lighting.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-17 Effective 12/01/19992. Maintain the proper distance between the operator and the computer screen. Occasionally focus your eyes off screen on a distant object (sec. 39.51a). 3. Provide video display terminal (VDT) operators periodic breaks of at least 10 minutes per hour away from the terminal. 53 - PLANT, ANIMAL, AND INSECT HAZARDS. Provide seasonal alerts about plant, animal, and insect hazards prevalent locally. Ensure employees know preventive measures and how to render first aid for related local hazards. The JHA required for all work projects and activities shall identify the necessary PPE, such as gloves, goggles, lightweight dispos- able clothing, shoe covers, respirators, or bear spray/firearms.Employees shall be trained in the use of all required PPE. 53.01 - Authority. The authority for general safety and health provisions, training, and education related to plant, animal, andinsect hazards is in Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (29 CFR), sections 1926.20 and 1926.21. The authority for handling biohazardous material is in the Missoula Technology and Develop-ment Center Tech Tip 9451-2353, Handling Bio-Hazard Material. 53.1 - Poison Ivy/Oak/Sumac and Noxious Weeds. Instruct all employees who are subject to exposure, especially those known tobe highly sensitive, in plant identification. When possible, do not assign allergic employees to jobs that expose them to those plants and weeds (ex. 01). 1. Brief employees about poisonous plants and noxious weeds that are present in the work area. Even those who have no history of reactions may become sensitized after contact and have a seri-ous reaction. 2. When working in areas where poisonous plants or noxious weeds may be present: a. Wear proper field attire. b. Provide and apply a skin protectant or barrier cream. Fasten pant legs securely over boot tops (adhesive tapemay be necessary).WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-18 Effective 12/01/1999 c. Wear gloves and keep them away from the face and other exposed parts of the body. Do not touch skin withhands, clothes, or equipment that may have contacted poisonous plants or noxious weeds. 3. Whenever the skin contacts a poisonous plant or noxious weed, wash the area with cold water within 1 to 3 minutes or as soon as possible. Use liberal amounts of water to ensure that all poisonous oils are washed off. While working in the poisonous plantor noxious weed environment, do not use soap and/or hot water because they can remove the natural protective oils from your skin. 4. Destroy poisonous plants and noxious weeds around im- proved areas.53.1 - Exhibit 01 - Poisonous Plants Poison ivy Poison oak Poison sumac Dark areas show the range of poison ivy, oak, and sumac.\"Leaflets three, let it be!\"WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-19 Effective 12/01/19995. Avoid the smoke of burning poisonous plants. Inhaling this smoke can cause fever, malaise, tracheitis, bronchitis, and severe rash. 6. Upon returning from the field, use rubbing alcohol to cleanse skin that contacted poisonous plants. 7. Clean tools with citric-based solvent before storing (use appropriate gloves and adequate ventilation). 8. Avoid exposure through mishandling of contaminated clothes. Wash contaminated clothing separately from other clothesin hot water and detergent. 53.2 - Ticks and Chiggers. Ticks are carriers of biological agents that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Colorado tick fever, tickparalysis, lyme disease, tularemia, and relapsing fever. 53.21 - Ticks - General Safety Procedures. When working in an area likely to have infected ticks: 1. Spray clothes with an insect repellent, which may provide an additional barrier against ticks. Repellents, such as diethyl metatoloamide (DEET), do not kill ticks. Some sprays do containpermethrin, which kill ticks on contact. Always follow the manufacturer's application instructions for insect repellents and treatments. 2. Wear light-colored clothing that fits tightly at the wrists, ankles, and waist. Each outer garment should overlap the one above it. Cover trouser legs with high socks or boots and tuckshirttails inside trousers. 3. Search the body repeatedly (such as during rest periods and lunch), especially hairy regions and inside clothing, as ticksseldom attach themselves within the first few hours. 4. Remove ticks with fine-tipped tweezers or fingers. Grasp the tick as close as possible to the point of attachment and pull straightup, applying gentle pressure. Wash the skin with soap and water; then cleanse with rubbing alcohol. Do not try to remove the tick by burning it with a match or covering it with chemical agents. If thehead detaches during the removal procedure or the tick cannot be removed, seek medical attention.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-20 Effective 12/01/1999 5. Once the tick has been removed, place it in an empty con- tainer so it can be given to a physician should the victim experi- ence a reaction. Record the dates of tick exposure and removal. Anearly warning sign to watch for is a large red spot on a tick bite. Reactions within 2 weeks include fever, chills, headache, joint and muscle ache, significant fatigue, and facial paralysis. 6. If you observe any of the following symptoms, seek prompt medical attention: a.Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Within 2 to 14 days, sudden onset of headache, chills, fever, and general aches, reddish-purple-black spots appearing on the extremities and spreading to the trunk, neck, and face(80 percent of cases). b.Colorado Tick Fever. Sudden high fever, chills, fatigue, severe headache, and muscle aches. c.Tick Paralysis. Within 4 to 6 days, rapid paralysis start- ing in the extremities and extending to the face area. d.Lyme Disease. Within 3 days to several weeks, a ring- like rash develops in 60-80 percent of cases, along with flu-like symptoms that disappear even if not treated. Within weeks to months, neurologic abnormalities,including meningitis, encephalitis, and cardiac abnor- malities, may become chronic. Within 6 months to sev- eral years, joint and muscle pain and arthritis may occurin one or several joints. e.Tularemia. Chills, fever, loss of appetite, swollen lymph nodes, and ulcer at the wound site. f.Relapsing Fever. High fever, chills, and abdominal pain; these symptoms subside, only to reoccur at a later date. 53.22 - Chiggers - General Safety Procedures. In chigger- infested areas: 1. Apply insect spray according to the manufacturer's applica- tion instructions. 2. Do not sit on the ground or on logs and avoid walking through low vegetation, when possible. 3. Bathe in hot, soapy water after spending time in these areas.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-21 Effective 12/01/199953.3 - Poisonous Snakes, Spiders, and Scorpions. Rattle- snakes, copperheads, and water moccasins (cottonmouths) are poisonous snakes known as pit vipers. They have vertically ellipti-cal (egg-shaped) pupils and a heat-sensing pit midway between the eyes and nostrils on each side of a triangularly shaped head. The coral snake (also poisonous) may be identified by this rule of thumb: Red bands bordered by yellow (or white) indicate a venom- ous animal; thus, \"Red on yellow, kill a fellow; red on black, venom lack.\" This rule applies to all coral snakes native to the UnitedStates. 1. Learn what poisonous snakes (if any) are native to the area you will be working in. 2. Learn how to identify whether or not a snake is poisonous. If unsure, treat all snakes as poisonous. Study field guides or text book illustrations of indigenous venomous snakes (ex. 01). 3. Do not assume a young snake is not poisonous, because venomous snakes are capable of inflicting a fatal bite from birth. 53.31 - Precautions for Working in Snake Country. When work- ing in snake-infested areas: 1. Wear high top boots (just below the knee is preferred) and/or protective snake-proof leggings . Use a hiking stick. 2. Although snakes are deaf, they have a good sense of smell and vision and are very sensitive to ground-conducted vibrations. Since they are defensive animals and rarely attack, they remainimmobile or attempt to retreat if given the opportunity. When going through thick underbrush, be alert. Walk slowly and give snakes ample time to move out of the way. 3. Be particularly watchful in areas obscured by foliage or near ledges when walking or climbing in rocky country. Snakes have excellent camouflage ability so train your eyes to see their shapeand coloration. 4. Walk on clear paths as much as possible. Be careful where placing your feet and hands at all times.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-23 Effective 12/01/199953.31a - First Aid for Snake Bites. Snake bites in the United States are rarely fatal when medical care is sought early and ap- propriate antivenin is readily available. 1. Avoid panic. 2. Immobilize the bitten extremity and obtain medical assis- tance. 3. If you are alone when bitten, walk slowly, resting periodi- cally and using a makeshift crutch if the lower extremity is involved. Again, keep activity to a minimum. 53.4 - Spiders. Few spiders in the United States have venom that cause death. But the bites of the black widow and the brown re- cluse spiders can be fatal. Both spiders are found in most areas ofthe United States. The bite of the black widow is the more painful and often the more deadly of the two. Both prefer dark, out-of-the way places where they are seldom disturbed. Be alert for thesespiders in basements, garages, barns and other outbuildings, woodpiles and gardens, and under stones, logs, and vegetation. 1.Aggressive House Spider. Another dangerous spider is the aggressive house spider. The spider got its name because it readily bites when cornered or threatened. Its bite is not fatal but is serious and requires immediate medical attention. The light brownspider's body is in two segments that together are about half an inch (12-3/4 mm) long, excluding its hairy legs. This spider is among the most common spiders found in buildings. It rarely climbsvertical surfaces and is usually found on the ground or lower floors, especially in cool moist window wells and basements. 2.Female Black Widow Spider. The female black widow is shiny black with a red hourglass mark on the stomach. The female's body is about half an inch (12-3/4 mm) long, and the male is less than half this size. The initial bite may be sharply painful, butmany bites are not recognized initially. 3.Brown Recluse Spider. The brown recluse is light brown with a darker brown violin shaped marking on the top of its 1/3 inchto 2/3 inch (8-15 mm) body. Brown recluse spiders are most active at night from spring through fall, emerging from woodpiles, rat nests, and other dark, dry environments. The bite can vary from aWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-24 Effective 12/01/1999 mild and transient skin irritation to more complicated kidney and other disorders, and even death. Refer to exhibit 01 for identifica- tion. 4.Spider Bites. The aggressive house spider has a bite often confused with that of a brown recluse spider. At first the bite pro- duces a very slight sensation. A small hard area appears within 30minutes or less and is surrounded by an expanding reddened area of 2 to 6 inches (51-153 mm) in diameter. The area will blister and eventually break and ooze serum. Although the ulcer scabs over,tissue beneath the scab may continue to die. The loss of tissue 53.4 - Exhibit 01 - Spiders Black WidowAggressive HouseSpider hour-glass marking abdomenWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-25 Effective 12/01/1999may become so severe that surgical repair is needed. Similar to the necrotic bite of a brown recluse spider (a necrotic bite causes tissue to die), the resulting lesion heals slowly, frequently leaving apermanent scar. The most common spider bite symptom is a severe migraine head- ache, sometimes occurring within 30 minutes, usually within 10hours. The headache may persist for 2 to 7 days and is sometimes accompanied by nausea, weakness, tiredness, temporary loss of memory, and vision impairment. Signals of a spider bite include: a. Nausea and vomiting. b. Difficulty breathing and swallowing.c. Sweating and salivating profusely. d. Irregular heart rhythms e. Severe pain and swelling in the bite area.f. A mark indicating a possible bite. 5.First Aid for Spider Bites. a. Wash the area with soap and water.b. Apply a cold pack. c. Seek medical care as soon as possible to receive an antivenin. 53.5 - Scorpions. Scorpions in the United States are divided into two groups based on the severity of their sting. Scorpions whose venom can be lethal are found in the desert areas of Arizona, NewMexico, California, and Texas, as well as along the northern shore of Lake Mead in Nevada. The venom of these scorpions contains neurotoxins that produce systemic effects, as well as local burningand pain, which can be accentuated by tapping over the envenomed area (tap test). All other scorpions in the United States produce a local reaction that consists of painful swelling and burn-ing with a discoloring of the skin. Today, death from the sting of a \"lethal\" scorpion is preventable. Proper care includes washing the wound, applying a cold pack, andgetting medical help as soon as possible to receive antivenin. Scorpions are nocturnal feeders and most live above ground and hide in old stumps, lumber piles, firewood, loose bark on fallentrees, ground debris, or crevices during the daytime.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-26 Effective 12/01/1999 When working in scorpion and spider areas, be aware and take these precautions: 1. When camping, always inspect in and under sleeping pads, sleeping bags, tarps, or other ground covers before use. 2. Always inspect and shake out clothing before wearing. 3. Do not leave work gloves, boots, jackets, or hats on the ground. 5. Always inspect outdoor toilets before use. 6. Never walk around in the dark without wearing shoes or boots. 7. Always have a flashlight for inspecting outhouses, clothing, and bedding. 8. Always inspect logs, stumps, rocks, and any other areas before sitting down. 9. When working in hot, dry areas, be especially watchful when using shady spots for rest breaks. 10. Before use, inspect those items that have been stored in the shade while working. 11. Always wear gloves (leather preferred) when moving or handling lumber, firewood, trash, or debris that could hide or con- tain spiders or scorpions. If an area that was stung or bitten shows rapid inflammation and pain, or the person bitten or stung develops other symptoms, such as chills, fever, joint pains, nausea, or vomiting, seek medicalattention immediately. 53.6 - Insect Stings and Bites. 53.61 - Honey Bees. The honey bee is one of the few domesti- cated insects that is maintained in hives. Numerous species of honey bee exist. The Italian honey bee, a common strain of Europe, is also widespread in the United States. Wild honey bee coloniesusually nest in hollow trees or crevices in rocks but may nest in walls of occupied buildings.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-27 Effective 12/01/1999An event of considerable health concern has been the spread of the Africanized honey bee. This strain is characterized by large populations (one queen may lay tens of thousands of eggs), fre-quent swarming, nonstop flights of at least 12 miles (19 km), and a tendency toward mass attack following minimal provocation. 1. Single stings from any of these insects generally do not require medical attention. There may be an immediate sharp pain followed by redness and swelling. For mild bee stings, application of ice packs often gives relief. Honey bees and yellow jacketsoccasionally leave their stinger in the wound. Stingers should be scraped or brushed off with a sharp-edged instrument. Do not remove stingers with tweezers, which may squeeze the attachedvenom sac and worsen the injury. 2. Some individuals are sensitized to bee and wasps stings and may react with a widespread rash, asthmatic breathing, tissueswelling, a fall in blood pressure, or sometimes unconsciousness. Employees with a history of allergic reactions to insect stings should carry an appropriate emergency kit prescribed by a physi-cian and wear medical identification tags. Such employees should also inform supervisors and co-workers of their situation and what assistance, if any, is appropriate for an allergic reaction. 53.61a - Safety Guidelines. 1. For outdoor field work, always wear appropriate field attire - long sleeved shirts, long trousers, and appropriate boots (identifiedin the JHA). It is recommended to tuck trouser legs into socks. 2. Wear appropriate light-colored clothing, including socks. Avoid wearing leather. When defending their nests, bees targetobjects that resemble their natural predators (such as bears and skunks). They tend to go after dark, leather, or furry objects. Bees see the color red as black so fluorescent orange is a better workclothing choice than red. 3. Avoid wearing scents of any kind. Bees communicate by scent and tend to be very sensitive to odors. Avoid stronglyscented shampoo, soaps, perfumes, after-shaves, and heavily scented gum. If riding, avoid the use of lemony or citrus-smelling fly control products on your horse.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-28 Effective 12/01/1999 4. Avoid identified nests and never poke or throw objects at nests. If a nest location could affect people, inform your supervisor or local authorities even if the bees appear to be docile. 5. If attacked, shield your face with your arms and leave the area. 53.61b - Africanized Honey Bees. These bees are docile when seeking out a new nestsite and establishing a nest. In the field, European honey bees and Africanized honey bees are visually indistinguishable, but the following are behavioral patterns typicalof the Africanized honey bees: 1. Africanized honey bees display random nest selection. They may nest in areas not normally selected by European honey bees;however, they have been known to take over European honey bee nests. 2. After developing brood and honey stores, Africanized honey bees become extremely defensive and easily agitated. 3. When in established hives, Africanized honey bees quickly respond in large numbers to nearby stimuli, such as a loud noisecreated by chain saws or working machinery. 4. Africanized honey bees are attracted mainly to the face and neck area. If attacked, get away quickly while covering the headand neck area. Do not stand still, swat, or try to hide underwater. Seek inside shelter, such as buildings or vehicles. 5. If stung, remove stinger(s) by scraping sideways, not pull- ing. Seek medical attention if an employee has: a. Allergic reaction. b. Systemic reaction.c. Multiple stings (15 or more). 53.62 - Mosquitoes. When massive flooding occurs, a significant increase in mosquito populations also increases the chances of anoutbreak of encephalitis. Ticks that ingest mosquitoes may also transmit encephalitis to humans. Encephalitis produces influenza- like symptoms, including headaches, lethargy, fever, double vision,extreme muscle weakness, confusion, tremors, or seizures.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-29 Effective 12/01/1999Use of repellents containing DEET or brand name products, such as Duranon, is recommended. Note: Duranon is applied to clothing only, not directly to the skin. 53.7 - Bears, Mountain Lions, and Other Animals. 53.71 - Bears. 1.Black Bear. The most common bear encountered by field- going Forest Service employees is the black bear. Black bears are the most numerous and widely distributed of all North American bears. They occur in more than 30 of the lower 48 states, fromMaine to Florida and from California to Washington. They also occur throughout Canada and Alaska, extending up to treeline below the Arctic Circle. Injuries as a result of close encounters with black bears are ex- tremely rare and if they occur, usually are not life threatening. In a survey of 500 people injured by black bears, at least 90 percentresulted in minor scratches or bites inflicted by bears that were either conditioned to human foods or habituated to human pres- ence. 2.Grizzly Bear. The grizzly (brown) bear ranges from Alaska through western Canada, with remnant populations located in relatively undeveloped lands, primarily in the northern Rocky Moun-tains. Attacks by grizzly bears are rare and sporadic. Female grizzly (brown) bears are extremely aggressive in defense of their young. 3.Training on Bear Behavior and Safety. Because of the unpredictable disposition of all bears, field-going employees should receive training to the extent they will be exposed. Bear-behavior training should, as a minimum, include these ele- ments: a. Differences between black and grizzly (brown) bears. b. Identification of bear signs (tracks, scat, scrapes, kills, and claw marks). c. Bear behavior and body language. d. Precautions to keep a field camp safe from bears. En- sure food and food containers are stored in an accept- able manner.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-30 Effective 12/01/1999 e. Techniques to avoid bear encounters while hiking, work- ing, camping, or other outdoor activities. f. How to respond if attacked by a bear (sec. 51.21 and 51.3). g. Aerosol defensive sprays use, storage, and transporta- tion (refer to sec. 51.3 for the requirements). 4.Safety Practices. Employees must understand the impor- tance of keeping their distance from any animal that is eating or mating, appears to be sick or injured, or is with its young. If ananimal seems unafraid, abnormally aggressive, or drunk, it may be a sign of rabies (sec. 53.73b). Leave the scene and report the incident to the appropriate authority. Most bears prefer to stay away from humans. Given the chance, bears avoid people and go about their business. 53.72 - Mountain Lions. Generally, mountain lions are solitary, quiet, elusive animals. They are most active from dusk to dawn, although they travel and hunt in daylight. Working with other em- ployees and making noise, reduces the chance of surprising a lion.In the event of a confrontation, employees should: 1. Give the lion a way to escape. 2. Talk calmly, yet firmly.3. Stop or back away slowly. Never crouch, try to hide, turn away, or run away. 4. Try to appear larger by raising arms or an object over the head. 5. If the lion behaves aggressively, throw stones, branches, or whatever can be reached without crouching down or turning away. 6. Fight back if attacked. Shout loudly. Try to remain standing. If down, try to get up. Protect the head and neck with hands and arms.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-31 Effective 12/01/199953.73 - Other Animals and Hazards. 53.73a - Hantavirus. Hantavirus is a cause of acute pulmonary disease and death in many regions of the United States. The pri-mary carrier is the deer mouse. Other rodents that may be carriers include squirrels, rats, chipmunks, and other kinds of mice. Transmission occurs by inhalation of the aerosolized virus when dried materials contaminated by rodent excreta are disturbed; introduction into broken skin, eyes, nose, mouth; or ingestion of contaminated food or water. People have also become infectedafter being bitten by an infected animal. 1.Unit Planning and Safety Procedures. Each unit shall develop a Hantavirus Prevention Action Plan and make it availableas a resource for writing site-specific JHAs. Contact State and county public health agencies for local recommendations. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issuedguidelines for dealing with hantavirus. 2.Training. Ensure that employees receive training in hantavirus awareness. 3.General Employee Safety Practices. In most cases, em- ployees shall: a. Treat all rodents as if they carry the virus.b. Seek early treatment if there was possible contact with carriers and signs of potential symptoms. Symptoms may appear 1 to 6 weeks (usually 2 to 3) after contactand include fever, nausea, headache, muscle aches, cough, and increasing acute respiratory trouble. c. Avoid direct contact with rodents (live or dead), their droppings, urine, saliva, nests, or items that may be contaminated. Do not feed mice, chipmunks, or other rodents. d. Remove aerosolized virus. Ventilate closed buildings or areas inside buildings by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes. Use an exhaust fan or cross ventila-tion, if possible. Leave the area until the airing-out period is finished. e. Always wear rubber or disposable gloves when cleaning areas where rodents have been.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-32 Effective 12/01/1999 f. Do not sweep or vacuum until the area has been soaked with disinfectant (bleach solution). Carpets and furniture should be disinfected or shampooed. Launder beddingand clothing with detergent and warm/hot water. Dry the clothing and bedding in a dryer to aid in disinfection. g. Where there is heavy rodent infestation, wear high efficiency National Institute of Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified particulate air respirators (sec. 21.13), disposable coveralls, rubber boots or disposable shoecovers, disposable head cover, two pairs of latex gloves, and eye protection, such as goggles. 4.Specific Employee Safety Practices. Ensure that employ- ees involved in live trapping for research studies are competent in wild animal capture techniques developed to abate hantavirus exposure, and that they comply with the following: a. Wear required PPE: high efficiency particulate air respi- rators (sec. 21.13), disposable coveralls, disposable shoe covers, suitable eye protection, and two pair oflatex gloves. b. Decontaminate live traps by soaking in a virucide. Follow precautions for accidental exposure listed on the viru-cide label and the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). c. Treat as biohazardous material waste and properly dispose of items (such as capture bags and gloves) thatcannot be completely disinfected. Except in remote areas, burying and incineration are not appropriate means of disposal (sec. 53.01). 53.73b - Rabies. The rabies virus is an acute, often fatal, viral disease most commonly transmitted through the saliva of an in- fected mammal and, less commonly, by aerosols (para. 3). 1. Employees should avoid any wild animal (especially rac- coons, skunks, foxes, and bats) that appears to have lost its fear of humans or is behaving abnormally. Abnormal and aggressive be-havior in domestic animals is also a warning sign to exercise cau- tion. 2. Early treatment is crucial. Physical symptoms include pain at the wound site, fever, headache, malaise, apprehension, diffi- culty swallowing, muscle spasms, and paralysis. As the diseaseWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-33 Effective 12/01/1999progresses, victims may become disoriented and agitated and begin hallucinating. 3. Transmission of the rabies virus by inhalation of aerosols (created from saliva, secretions, and excretions of bats in a dark, humid environment) has also occurred. Employees involved in investigation of bat-roost sites (caves, mines, and buildings) or whohave other work projects/activities in locations where bats are commonly found shall: a. Obtain a pre-exposure rabies vaccination and a tetanus shot. b. Wear appropriate PPE, such as light cut-resistant gloves, depending on the bat species. c. If bitten, cleanse the wound with soap, water, and disin- fectant; seek medical attention; and record the date and location of exposure. 54 - ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS. 54.01 - References. 1.

Radiation intensity varies with numerous factors, including time of day, altitude, latitude, andseason. About 80 percent of the ultraviolet (UV) rays reaching the Earth's surface do so between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., with peak hours of exposure generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Employees whospend much of their workday outside should be cautioned about the short- and long-term risks of UV exposure. To minimize UV exposure: 1. Keep exposed skin covered by wearing a hat, a bandanna, and a long-sleeved shirt (with sleeves rolled down and collar turned up). 2. Wear sun glasses that filter out 100 percent of the UV rays. The use of non-UV protected sunglasses or photogrey glasses can increase the chance of UV damage to the retina and are not rec-ommended. 3. Provide and use protective sunscreen lotion, cream, oil, and lip balm as identified in the JHA. 4. When possible, stay indoors during the peak exposure time in the summer or find worksites that are shady. 5. Alter work schedules, where appropriate, to avoid peak summer exposure.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-35 Effective 12/01/19996. Where appropriate, alternate workers during the summer months to reduce exposure. 54.2 - Extreme Weather Conditions. Use the buddy system while training and working in extreme weather conditions. 54.21 - Working in Hot Conditions. Individual differences in heat tolerance are related to fitness, hydration, illness, drugs and medi-cation, and fatigue (sec. 54.01). Heat stress occurs when the body's core temperature rises beyond safe limits. Evaporation of sweat is the body's main line of defenseagainst heat. As sweat evaporates, it cools the body. When water lost by sweating is not replaced, the body's heat controls break down and body temperature climbs dangerously. Three factors thatcan contribute to heat stress are low or poor physical fitness, ex- cess weight, and hypertension (ex. 01). 1. Fit workers adjust or acclimate to work in the heat twice as fast as unfit workers (4 days compared to 8). Be especially careful the first 2 to 3 days. 2. Schedule the hardest work during the cooler hours of the day. Set a moderate work pace. As the temperature increases, stop 54.21 - Exhibit 01 - Heat Stress Chart Only heat-acclimated individuals can work safely for extended periods. Heat sensitive and unacclimated individuals may suffer. Little danger of heat stress for acclimated individuals. 10515100 95 35 30 25 2090 85 100High LowTemperature Relative Humidity (%)Moderate(oF) (oC)Only heat-acclimated can work safely for extended periods.

Little danger of heat stress for acclimated individuals.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-36 Effective 12/01/1999 for frequent rest periods of at least 15 minutes. Relax in cool loca- tions, where possible. 3. Always have an adequate supply of water available and ensure that employees are getting their needed liquids. Plan ahead for drinking water; don't allow water to run out before resupplying (ex. 02). To prevent dehydration: a. Drink 8 to 16 ounces (200 to 400 milliliters) of water before work. b. Take frequent drinks during each hour of work (1 quart or 1 liter per hour). c. Drink as much as possible at lunch and the evening meal. d. Continue replacing fluids throughout the evening. e. Limit caffeine drinks, such as coffee or cola.f. Avoid alcoholic drinks. 4. Provide well-planned meals and healthy snacks, which are vital to maintain work capacity and to avoid heat disorders throughadequate replacement of water, salt, and potassium. Employees 54.21 - Exhibit 02 - Guidelines for Water Requirements Quarts (Liters) Per Day at Temperatures: Less Than More Than 80 \u00b0F 80 \u00b0F Activity Typical Duties (26 \u00b0C) (26 \u00b0C) Light Desk work, 6 9 fire camp-relatedactivities Moderate Hiking, receiving and 9 12 distributing supplies infire camps Heavy Strenuous work, digging 12 15 fire line, prescribedburningWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-37 Effective 12/01/1999may want to eat less. Carbohydrate/electrolyte beverages can help maintain energy and work output during long periods without food or snacks. Salt in foods and ample use of the salt shaker providesodium. Do not use salt tablets. Include potassium-rich foods, such as bananas and citrus fruits. High-protein foods (such as meat) increase metabolic heat production and water loss, and are notrecommended. 5. Wear hardhats, as they provide a very effective air condi- tioning system. 6. Prevent sunburn by wearing lightweight, light-colored loose clothing, which allows air to circulate and sweat to evaporate and offers protection from direct sun. Bare skin absorbs the sun's radi-ant heat and raises body temperature. 7. Bathe or wash thoroughly each day to keep pores and hair clean. Dirty, clogged skin and matted hair restrict heat dissipation. 8. During periods of continued extreme temperatures (90 oF/32 oC or above), ensure that supervisors monitor em- ployees and that employees watch each other for signs of heat-stress disorders, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke. a. Heat cramps are identified by muscular pains and cramps, with leg and abdominal muscles usually af- fected first. Remedies include stretching and gently massaging cramped muscles and applying a heatingpad or hot water bottle to help relieve muscle spasms. b. Heat exhaustion is characterized by fatigue, weakness, and collapse. The skin becomes pale, cool, and clammy,accompanied by nausea, dizziness, a throbbing head- ache, breathing problems, and diarrhea. Recommended actions include moving to a cool, shady place, lying withthe feet raised 8 to 12 inches (204 to 306 mm) above the head, and loosening clothing and applying cool com- presses to the skin. If there is no improvement quickly,seek medical attention at once. c. Heatstroke is a medical emergency. Unacclimatized employees are especially prone to heatstroke. Symp-toms are confusion, high body temperature, hot (often dry) skin, rapid pulse, convulsions, loss of conscious-WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-38 Effective 12/01/1999 ness, and coma. Lack of sweating is one sign of immi- nent heatstroke. Do not delay treatment, it must be immediate. Cool the body down quickly. Administer fluidsand transport the victim to a medical facility as quickly as possible. 54.22 - Working in Cold Conditions. The best defense against frostbite and hypothermia is to avoid exposure. Recognize hypoth- ermia-producing weather and prepare for it. Prevention is the best tool. Always check weather conditions and be familiar with the areabefore trips. Be prepared and pack a survival kit to be carried by each person. Exposure to hazards associated with the cold can occur when employees are inside (such as cold storage areas and tree cool- ers), as well as outside. Factors that put employees more at risk include being older or overweight, having allergies or poor circula-tion, smoking, drinking, and taking medications, such as sedatives. All persons who work outdoors in cold climates are encouraged to have cold weather survival training (sec. 11.3). Where work oractivities are planned during extremely cold weather the JHA shall address the specific conditions anticipated, including essential PPE. Key items for winter survival are: 1. Get adequate rest. 2. Always anticipate bad weather. Carry additional warm cloth- ing with you. Dress for the conditions in layers of loose, dry clothes;polypropylene or wool underneath, with windproof and waterproof material on top. Ensure that your hands, feet, face, neck, and head are covered and well protected. 3. Keep active to maintain the body's metabolism and keep your body temperature high. 4. Prevent dehydration by drinking warm water. Avoid drinking cold water, snow, or ice. Avoid caffeinated beverages. 5. Set up camp early and prepare for dropping night tempera- tures. Find shelter and firewood before dark. 6. Eat balanced meals and high energy snacks.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-39 Effective 12/01/19997. Travel in pairs as a minimum. Never travel alone in isolated areas (sec. 11.1). A line officer or other competent person must approve and document the assignment of employees to work alonein undeveloped areas (sec. 21.14). 54.22a - Frostbite. Frostbite is generally brought on by direct contact with a cold object or exposure of a body part to cold air.Body parts most often affected are the nose, ears, cheeks, fingers, and toes. Test for circulation and sensation regularly by wiggling fingers and toes. Watch for signs of frostbite in yourself and co-workers. Major factors causing frostbite are wind and water chill. 1. Frostbite may develop slowly and go undetected until the affected part or parts become white. As the cooling process contin-ues, numbness replaces any sensation of cold or discomfort. 2. If the early stages of frostbite go untreated, the affected part or parts take on a waxy appearance and feel frozen to a gentletouch; however, when the skin is pressed firmly, it feels soft and pliable beneath the frozen area. At this stage of frostbite, the af- fected person must be moved to a dry covered area, and the af-fected part or parts gently handled. If transportation to a hospital is delayed, apply steady warmth by submerging the body part or parts in warm water. Always follow up with medical care. 3. The next step is referred to as deep frostbite. Muscles, bones, deep blood vessels, and organ membranes can become frozen. The affected part becomes blotchy blue or gray, and thetissue feels frozen on the surface and when pressed firmly. For this stage of frostbite follow these steps: a. Transport the victim immediately to a hospital for medi- cal care. b. Gently cover the affected part or parts with dry blankets or clothing. c. Do not rub or chaff the frostbitten part or parts. d. If the tissue is frozen, keep it frozen until care can be initiated. e. Do not initiate thawing procedures if there is any danger of refreezing. Keeping the tissue frozen is less danger- ous than submitting it to refreezing.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-40 Effective 12/01/1999 54.22b - Hypothermia. Another cold hazard is hypothermia, a condition of subnormal body temperature. Lowering the internal core temperature of the body leads to mental and physical col-lapse. Hypothermia is a medical emergency. The three components of weather that affect cooling of the body core are temperature, wind, and moisture. Other factors that can cause or aggravatehypothermia include injuries, immobilization, immersion in water, lack of proper clothing or shelter, low blood sugar, and fatigue. Hypothermia usually occurs on a cold, wet windy day with tempera- tures at or above freezing. Most hypothermia cases develop be- tween 30 oF (-1 oC) and 50 oF (10 oC). Refer to exhibit 01 for a wind chill index. Hypothermia symptoms begin with feeling cold, experiencing pain in the extremities, and shivering as the body tries to raise its tem- perature. Other symptoms include numbness, muscle stiffness(especially in the neck, arms, and legs), poor coordination, drowsi- ness, slow or irregular breathing and heart rate, cool skin, and puffiness in the face. Thinking processes slow and victims becomeapathetic and disagreeable. As the body core cools further, mental function is impaired to a far greater extent, leading to confusion, disorientation, and lethargy.Slurred speech and loss of vision occur just prior to terminal coma. Hypothermia is a medical emergency. 1. Call for medical help. Transport the victim to a hospital for care as soon as possible. 2. Give artificial respiration when necessary. 3. Move the victim into a warm area. If shelter is not available, build a fire. Prevent further heat loss. 4. Get the victim out of frozen, wet, or tight clothes. 5. Bundle the victim in warm clothes, blankets, or sleeping bag. 6. If the victim is mildly impaired, give the victim warm liquids (no caffeine or alcohol). 7. If the victim is semiconscious, try and keep the person awake. Remove the victim's clothing and put the victim in a sleep-WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-41 Effective 12/01/1999Actual thermometer reading (F) 50 40 30 20 10 0 -10 -20 -30 -40 -50 -60 Wind speed(mph) Equivalent temperature (F) Calm 50 40 30 20 10 0 -10 -20 -30 -40 -50 -60 5 48 37 27 16 6 -5 -15 -26 -36 -47 -57 -68 10 -70 -132 -148 (Wind speeds Little danger Increasing Great greater than (for properly danger danger 40 mph have clothed person) little additionalDanger of freezing exposed flesh effect)54.22b - Exhibit 01 - Wind Chill Index (\u00b0F)(\u00b0F)WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-42 Effective 12/01/1999 ing bag with another person, allowing the body heat to warm the victim. Do not give liquids until fully conscious. 8. Transport the victim to the nearest hospital. Keep the per- son lying down and as still as possible. 9. Do not assume the hypothermia victim is dead even though the person may appear to be. There may be no detectable heart-beat, breathing, or other signs of life. CPR can be given en route to a hospital. 54.23 - Lightning and Thunderstorms. The most dangerous period for thunderstorms with cloud-to-ground lightning is from March through August. The mature stage of the storm may be marked on the ground by a sudden reversal of wind direction, anoticeable rise in wind speed, and a sharp drop in temperature. Heavy rain, hail, and lightning occur only in the mature stage of a thunderstorm. Keep informed; know what the storm is doing. Duringa thunder storm: 1. Do not use radios, telephones, plug-in electrical equipment, or plumbing fixtures. 2. Turn off generators and electrical equipment. 3. Put down all tools. Caulk boots are particularly good grounding agents and should be removed. 4. Do not handle flammable materials in open containers. 5. Stay in your vehicle unless it is metal-tracked, has a non- metal top, or is open. 6. If you are on a metal-tracked vehicle, dismount and seek appropriate shelter. Get away from water tanks, ponds, streams, lakes, and swimming pools. Avoid parking lots, tennis courts, ath-letic fields, and golf courses. 7. Get under a steel bridge, but never touch the steel and never sit or stand on damp ground. 8. If boats are in use, have them docked. Get out of boats and away from the water. 9. Ground and anchor all aircraft.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-43 Effective 12/01/199910. Take shelter in a building, if one is available. Choose a building with lightning protection in preference to a small, unpro- tected building. Close the doors and windows, if possible. If that isnot possible, stay away from open doors and windows, and areas on top of buildings. Stay away from fireplaces, radiators, stoves, metal pipes, and sinks. 11. If no buildings are available, your best protection is a cave, ditch, tunnel, canyon, or head-high clumps or trees in open forest areas. 12. When there is no shelter, avoid tall objects such as lone trees. If only isolated trees are nearby or if you are in open country, the best protection is to make yourself as small a target as pos-sible. Drop to your knees, bend forward with your hands resting on your knees, and keep a distance of twice the height of the nearest tree between you and the tree. To minimize the flow of the current,keep your feet together. Keep away from wire fences, telephone lines, electrically conductive objects, and railroad tracks. 13. Avoid the tops of ridges, hilltops, wide-open spaces, ledges, out-crops of rocks, and sheds or shelters in exposed locations . Avoid grouping people together. 14.Move away from horses and stock . 15. Advise crew members that if they feel an electrical charge, if their hair stands on end, or their skin tingles, a lightning strike may be imminent. Persons struck by lightning may receive a severe electrical shock and burns, including entry and exit wounds. These individuals carry no electrical charge after exposure to lightning and can be touchedsafely. Victims of a lightning strike may suffer respiratory and/or cardiac arrest. Therefore, administer CPR immediately if needed and first aid, as required. Note that an individual in full-cardiac arrest is a medical emergency and must be transported to an advanced life-support medical facil- ity as quickly as possible. Where there are multiple lightning strike victims, render emergency medical treatment first to individuals who are unresponsive andWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-44 Effective 12/01/1999 next to those with vital signs who exhibit the most life threatening injuries. 54.24 - Tornadoes. A severe thunderstorm may spawn a tornado, which is a violently rotating column of air that descends from a cloud system. Most tornadoes occur during the mid-afternoon or early evening (3 p.m. - 7 p.m.) and move from the southwest to thenortheast at speeds ranging from stationary to 70 miles an hour. While hail may or may not precede a tornado, the area adjacent to large hail is often where strong to violent tornadoes are most likelyto occur. When large hail begins to fall, a tornado may be nearby. Seek appropriate shelter. Once the hail has stopped, remain in a protected area until the storm has moved away, usually 15 to 30minutes after the hail ceases. During a tornado: 1. Do not attempt to flee to safety by vehicle. Seek sturdy shelter, such as a building; a ditch or ravine offers better protectionthan a vehicle. 2. Stay away from windows, exterior doors, and outside walls. 3. Go to storm cellars or well constructed basements, which offer the greatest protection from tornadoes, or to small interior rooms, such as a closet or bathroom, which provide safety from flying debris and are less likely to experience roof collapse. 4. If caught in a timbered area during periods of high winds or immediately after a windstorm, get into a natural opening large enough to give protection from falling trees and limbs. 54.25 - Flash Floods. Flooding occurs seasonally when rains, coupled with melting snows or torrential rains associated with tropical storms, drain into small tributaries and fill river basins withtoo much water, too quickly. Flash flood waves can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and bridges, and create new chan- nels. When a flash flood is imminent, act quickly: 1. Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams and washes, particularly during threatening conditions. 2. Avoid areas subject to flooding. This includes dips, low-lying areas, canyons, and washes.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-45 Effective 12/01/19993. Avoid already flooded and high velocity flow areas. Do not attempt to cross a swift flowing stream on foot where water is above your knees. 4. Do not attempt to drive over a flooded road where you do not know the depth of water before crossing. The road bed may not be intact under the water. 5. If your vehicle stalls, abandon it immediately and seek higher ground. 6. Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recog- nize flood dangers. 54.3 - Altitude-Related Problems. High altitude (8,000 feet or 2,438 meters and higher above sea level) affects a person's abilityto take in, transport, and utilize oxygen, thus affecting work capac- ity. During acclimation, employees working in high altitudes should work slower and take frequent breaks to avoid excessive fatigue.Eat a high-carbohydrate diet for added energy and take special care to maintain hydration since altitude hastens fluid loss. Individuals vary in their ability to acclimatize; some adjust quickly, without discomfort, while acute mountain sickness (AMS) develops in others. AMS is most commonly misdiagnosed as a viral flu-like illness, hangover, exhaustion, or dehydration. The incidence and severity of AMS depend on the rate of ascent, altitude attained (especially the sleeping altitude), length of exposure, level of exertion, and inher-ent physiologic susceptibility. AMS can be classified as mild, mod- erate, or severe on the basis of symptoms (ex. 01). Treatment for AMS includes descending to a lower altitude and the administrationof oxygen, if available. Other problems related to altitude include decrease in temperature and the effects of cold (sec. 54.22), ultraviolet penetration increas-ing the risk of sunburn and skin cancer, and snowblindness (sec. 54.11). 55 - TEMPORARY CAMPS. The requirements for health and safety in temporary labor camps, which accommodate large numbers ofWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-46 Effective 12/01/1999 workers and can be reached by highway or forest road, differ from those for remote-site camps, which serve only a few employees and typically cannot be reached by road. The following direction in sections 55.01 to 55.11 concerning water supply, sanitation, and food service operations applies to a large temporary labor camp. Safety hygiene and other concerns of re- mote camps are addressed in section 55.12. 55.01 - Authority. The authority for sanitation and temporary camps is in Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, section 1910.141 and 1910.142. 55.06 - Reference. Red Cross - Youth Camp Director's Safety Guide.

Coma may ensue within 24hours of the onset of ataxia.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-47 Effective 12/01/199955.11 - Temporary Camp Requirements. 55.11a - Water Supply. 1. Provide an adequate and convenient water supply, ap- proved by the appropriate health authority, for drinking, cooking, bathing, and laundry purposes. 2. Never assume water is safe. As a general policy, use only potable water from a tested and approved source. 3. Store water in safe containers and label them. 4. Ensure that drinking water is dispensed in individual sani- tary containers, such as paper cups, if fountains are not available. One-for-all canteens or drinking cups and other common utensils are prohibited (29 CFR 1910.142). Where single-service cups aresupplied, provide both a sanitary container for unused cups and a receptacle for used cups. 55.11b - Other Requirements. 1. Install all heating, cooking, and water heating equipment in accordance with State and local ordinances, codes, and regula- tions governing such installations. 2. If a camp is used during cold weather, provide adequate heating equipment. 3. Provide beds, cots, bunks, and suitable storage facilities, such as wall lockers, for clothing and personal effects. a. Ensure that each room for sleeping contains at least 50 square feet (15-1/4 m 2) of floor space per occupant and that shelters have at least 7-foot (2 m) ceilings. b. Place beds no closer than 36 inches (1 m), both laterally and end-to-end, and at least 12 inches (1/3 m) off thefloor. c. Space double-deck bunks no closer than 48 inches (1-1/5 m), both laterally and end-to-end. The minimumamount of clear space required between the upper and lower bunk is 27 inches (1/2 m). Triple-deck bunks are prohibited.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-48 Effective 12/01/1999 4. Ensure that living quarters have windows. The window area must total at least one-tenth of the floor area. Half of the windows must open for ventilation. a. Doors and windows must be screened with 16-mesh material. b. Doors shall be equipped with self-closing devices. 5. Where personnel cook, live, and sleep in the same area, provide 100 square feet (30-1/2 m) per person. 6. Provide sanitary facilities for storing and preparing food.7. Ensure that floors are level and constructed of wood, as- phalt, or concrete. Wooden floors shall be smooth and tight and kept in good repair. a. Wooden floors must be elevated at least 1 foot (1/3 m) above the ground. Back filling around outer walls is permissible in areas subject to extreme temperatures. b. Steps shall have no more than an 8 inch (204 mm) rise and nonslip treads. Where four or more steps are present, handrails are required. 8. Ensure that each camp has a first aid kit(s) available (refer to the Glossary). At least one person must be certified in first aid/ CPR. 9. Provide for communications systems. Radio or telephone communications with the field-crew headquarters or other links with the outside are mandatory. Have a daily contact schedule for everycamp. Include measures that will be taken in case a reporting schedule is missed. 10. Where camps are near roads, provide a vehicle for emer- gency use. 55.11c - Camp Sanitation. Construct, operate, and maintain temporary camps according to national and local public healthstandards (29 CFR 1910.141 and 1910.142). When living in Government camps or quarters, maintain reasonable standards of personal hygiene and housekeeping. Take effectivemeasures to prevent flies, rodents, and other insects and animals from infesting camps. Keep all places clean to the extent that the nature of the work allows.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-49 Effective 12/01/19991. Place central refuse bins on a hard surface. The refuse bins must meet safety requirements for stability as outlined in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z245.3. The refuse bins shoulddisplay a sign prohibiting children from climbing on units. 2. Collection must be frequent enough to prevent overflow, fly breeding, and odors. Open burning of rubbish and debris is dis-couraged and is subject to local ordinance. 3. Clean and sanitize cabins and tents weekly or more often as needed. 4. Clean and sanitize kitchens and restrooms daily. a. Always maintain a supply of soap, hot water, clean towels, and toilet paper. b. Keep showers, including mats, clean; disinfect them daily. 5. Keep subsistence supplies carefully and properly stored and protected from weather, flies, and rodents. 6. Where toilet facilities are provided for employees: a. Maintain natural or artificial lighting at all hours of the day and night. b. Keep toilet rooms sanitary, and clean them daily. c. Where a sewer is available, connect all camp sewer lines and floor drains from buildings to the sewer. d. Keep toilet facilities supplied with toilet paper, and en- sure that the number of toilets complies with OSHAstandards (29 CFR 1910.142 (d)). As a general rule, provide one toilet for every 15 people, but never less than two per camp. 55.11d - Food and Food Service Operations. A properly con- structed kitchen and dining hall must be adequate in size and separate from sleeping quarters and lavatories, with no openingsleading from living or sleeping quarters into the kitchen or dining hall. 1. Operate food service facilities in accordance with sound hygienic principles. When all or part of the food service is provided, ensure the food dispensed is wholesome and free from spoilage,WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-50 Effective 12/01/1999 and is processed, prepared, handled, and stored to protect from contamination. 2. Ensure that cooks meet State and local health require- ments. a. Do not permit any person with a communicable disease, including colds, to prepare, cook, serve, or otherwisehandle food, foodstuffs, or materials in any kitchen or dining room. Food handlers shall have clean hands and fingernails and be free from open sores. b. Ensure that persons wash hands thoroughly with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds before handling food and engaging in food preparation. c. To prevent food contamination, ensure that persons working in kitchens and dining halls wear hair nets (or caps) and clean clothes. 3. Keep kitchen areas and food storage facilities free of in- sects, rodents, and pests. Windows, door screens, and rodent- proof food storage facilities are basic requirements. a. Ensure that floors and food preparation surfaces are cleaned daily. b. Use different cutting boards for raw and cooked foods. Plastic ones are easier to clean. c. Scrub containers and utensils used in handling un- cooked foods with hot, soapy water before using themwith ready-to-serve foods. 4. Inspect cooking facilities frequently for general sanitary conditions and individual housekeeping standards. a. Inspect food storage facilities, including refrigerators, freezers, coolers, cabinets, and vaults, for cleanliness, spoilage, rodent/insect infestation, and food shelf life.Conduct and document food storage inspections weekly. b. Provide filters above grills. Clean the hoods over grills at least weekly to remove grease deposits, and equip themwith an automatic fire extinguishing system or grease extractors (Uniform Fire Code Article 13, Section 13.315). 5. Store all perishable food at temperatures that retard spoilage.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-51 Effective 12/01/1999a. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers in small, covered shallow containers within 2 hours after cooking; the quicker the better. Leave airspace around containers to help assurerapid, even cooling. Individual food portions, once served, may be served again only if they are safe and uncontaminated. b. Thaw foods in the refrigerator. c. Dispose of all moldy, spoiled, or contaminated foods immediately. Throw out all leftovers after 3 days. d. Maintain all potentially hazardous food at safe tempera- tures (ex. 01), except during necessary periods of prepa- ration and service. e. Place thermometers in each refrigeration unit and post the proper temperature levels near the thermometer. \u2014 Keep cold foods cold (below 40 oF/4 oC for refriger- ated foods, 0 oF/-17 oC for freezer foods.) \u2014 Keep hot foods hot (140 oF/60 oC or above until ready to serve). \u2014 Heat foods thoroughly; a rolling boil for sauces, soups, gravies, and other moist foods; 165 oF/74 oC for all other foods. f. Limit food preparation to areas specifically designated for this purpose. Eat prepared food in specified dining areas, not in sleeping areas. g. Unless arrangements are made and mutually agreed to, require each employee preparing personal meals to be responsible for cleaning cooking facilities, appliances,and personal cooking and eating utensils after the meal. h. In cooking facilities, use or store only such toxic materi- als as are required to maintain sanitary conditions. Toxicmaterials shall be identified, stored, and used only in such a manner and under such conditions that do not contaminate food or constitute a hazard to employees.Material safety data sheets shall be available and uti- lized for their intended purposes. 55.12 - Spike Camps/Remote-sites General Campout. When work projects or activities require camping out, it is important to be well prepared.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-53 Effective 12/01/199955.12a - Preparations. 1. Talk to coworkers who are familiar with the area. Study maps and aerial photos of the worksites and camp locations. 2. Ensure that the crew has reliable communications and a schedule for regular check in. 3. Prepare a travel itinerary and time schedule for the return to the trailhead and the trip back. 4. Procure foodstuffs carefully: Avoid glassware; consider freeze-dried foods and other nonperishables; label everything; take along sealable plastic boxes, bottles, and bags for perishables; andpurchase perishables just prior to departure. 5. Train personnel in the use of specific camp equipment, such as stoves and lanterns, handtools, maps, compass, GPS, and firstaid kits, camp sanitation, survival techniques, and radio operations. 55.12b - Other Concerns. Take appropriate steps to address the following: 1. Transportation of people and equipment. 2. Anticipated hazards of the specific work or activity. 3. Personal health needs.4. Disposal of waste material. 5. Choice and layout of camp. 6. Impact of weather and seasons.7. Natural hazards such as overhanging cliffs, areas subject to flash flooding, rock slides, tree snags, widowmakers, tall grass, and low marshy areas. 8. Adequate drainage. Choose campsites: a. Not within 200 feet (61 m) of swamps, pools, sink holes, or other surface water collection areas unless mosquitocontrol is in effect. b. Free of depressions that collect water. 9. Sufficient space to prevent overcrowding.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-54 Effective 12/01/1999 10. Food preparation areas and sleeping quarters located at least 500 feet (152-1/2 m) from livestock areas. 11. Bear precautions for food storage and preparation.12. Animal hazards, such as poisonous insects and snakes. 13. The presence of poison ivy, oak, and sumac. 55.12c - Cooking Operations. Crew leaders should ensure that well-balanced meals are prepared. Because of the unique prob- lems associated with transportation and storage of perishable foods at field camp locations, use freeze-dried, dehydrated, andother specially prepared food when possible. 1.Cooking Area. Choose a clean and reasonably flat spot for food preparation and cooking. Do not place cooking stoves inside tents. Use tarps or flys for protection from the weather. If using charcoal, have regular starter fuel available. Never use gasoline or camp stove fuel. 2.Meal Preparation. Provide a wash area for cooks and kitchen helpers, complete with hot water, soap, and towels. Spreadplastic sheets over food preparation areas and keep them clean. Personal cleanliness of both food handlers and helpers is essen- tial. Contamination under field conditions can quickly become aserious health threat. Open only the quantities of canned or sealed foods needed for each meal. Use up perishables as soon as possible. Cook all foodsthoroughly to kill bacteria. Serve food hot. 3.Cooking Utensils. Keep utensils clean. Store utensils in closed contamination-free containers until used. Never set dirtypots or containers on the food preparation surface. Use tongs or gloves when handling hot pots. 4.Food Storage and Serving. Store all unopened containers in the kitchen storage area. Store all nonperishable foods in resealable plastic containers. Keep the food serving area clean at all times. Never serve food with your fingers. Use disposable plates, cups, and eating utensils whenever possible.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-55 Effective 12/01/199955.12d - Food Rations. A wide variety of freeze-dried foods elimi- nate the concern for spoilage and should be considered for supple- menting food supplies. 1. Inspect canned foods and emergency rations annually and before use. Open and inspect (10 percent random sample) rations held in dry storage (40 oF to 65 oF or 4 oC to 18 oC) that are 3 years old. If storage conditions are unknown or dry storage is not within the 40 oF to 65 oF range, inspect rations more often. Rations ex- posed to temperatures above 90 oF (32 oC) can spoil in a few weeks or within 1 year, depending on storage conditions. Destroy rations after the fourth year. Destroy canned food stored in an unheated building that has been subject to freezing and thawing. 2. Destroy any canned food showing evidence of damage or spoilage, regardless of the expiration date. a. Leaky, rusted, swollen, weakened, or dented cans.b. Contents with a flat, sour taste, or mold growth. 3. If there is any doubt about the wholesomeness and safety of canned rations or other foods, destroy them. Always check thepacking date and advise users to closely examine the contents before eating. Destroy food that is abnormal in appearance, taste, or odor. 55.12e - Water Purification of Undeveloped Sources. All unde- veloped sources must be considered contaminated and unsafe for drinking water. For field situations, provide or obtain safe drinking water by: 1. Hauling water from a source that complies with public water system standards (refer to FSM 7422 for proper hauling containers,handling, and testing). 2. Using bottled water. 3. Using a point-of-use (POU) device that removes particles one micron or less in diameter that is labeled as certified by NSF International per NSF Standard 53 or labeled as an absolute one- micrometer filter. 4. Boiling as follows:WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 50-56 Effective 12/01/1999 a. Strain water through a clean cloth to remove sediment or floating matter. b. Boil water vigorously for at least 3 to 5 minutes.c. Aerate to improve taste by pouring water back and forth from one clean container to another several times. 5. Sterilizing canteens before each refilling in the following manner (unless each person has one for personal use): a. Submerge canteens in a solution of liquid laundry bleach and water ratio 1:100 (1 capful per gallon of water). b. Keep canteens submerged for a minimum of 1 hour (canteens must be completely filled with solution). c. Rinse thoroughly with clean water. 55.12f - After-Work Organized Swimming Activities. Organized swimming activities must be approved by a line officer. If orga- nized swimming is approved: 1.Ensure that the JHA includes a plan for water rescue, to respond and deal immediately with accidents. 2. Designate a person, qualified in water safety, to supervise the activity. a. Have a competent person inspect potential swimming areas for treacherous currents, deep holes, or otherhazards. Keep swimming areas free of debris and rocks. b. Do not permit anyone to enter the water alone. Equip the area with strategically placed life-saving equipment suchas reaching-poles, lines, and ring-buoys. c. Assign lifeguards whenever there are swimmers in the water. Have a lookout observing all swimmers all thetime. Use a buddy system. d. Prohibit swimming after dark. e. Monitor the weather.f. Ensure that employees: (1) Do not swim if overheated. (2) Are able to recognize the symptoms of exhaustion and know what to do. (3) Know what to do for cramps, which can be caused by cold water. (4) Never dive into water until the depth and water temperature have been checked. Check the loca- tion of others before diving.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-1 Effective 12/01/1999CHAPTER 60 - HAZARDOUS MATERIALS Contents 61 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 61.01 Authority 61.05 Definitions 61.06 References61.1 General Safety Requirements 61.11 Personnel Qualifications Personal Protective Equipment61.13 Procedures 61.14 Safety 61.15 and Transportation61.18 Safety 61.21 Protective 61.23 Procedures 61.24 Chemical Hygiene Plan61.25 Emergency Planning 61.25a Emergency Evacuation Procedures and Communications Plan 61.25b Emergency Guidelines 61.26 Safety Practices 61.3 Greenhouse Safety61.31 Operations61.32b Pesticides 61.32c Equipment 61.32d Electrical61.4 Incompatible Chemicals 61.41 Area 1 - Solvents 61.42 Area 2 - Corrosive Materials61.43 Area 3 - Strong Oxidizing Agents 61.44 Area 4 - Remaining Chemicals 61.5 Flammable/Combustible LiquidsWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-2 61.51e General Petroleum Gas61.7 Pesticides 61.71 Safety 61.71a of Pesticides 61.71c Disposal 61.8 Asbestos61.81 Procedures 61.9 Lead 62 EXPLOSIVES AND BLASTING AGENTS 62.01 Authority 62.06 Reference 62.1 Personnel QualificationsWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-3 Effective 12/01/1999CHAPTER 60 - HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 61 - HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.

It is vital that employees inspect their equipment and work areas for hazards and defects every work day and that they correct orrepair hazards and defects as they occur. In any area where personnel may be exposed to hazardous levels of chemicals, it is the duty of supervisors to monitor the environ-ment at regular intervals consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1001. 61.25 - Emergency Planning. 1. Conspicuously post telephone numbers for emergency assistance near each phone in laboratory work areas. Include names and telephone numbers of employees trained in first aid. 2. Make an appropriate first aid kit readily available for each laboratory. Maintain emergency equipment and locate it along normal paths of travel where it is readily accessible. 3. Locate emergency showers in or near all laboratory rooms with access unobstructed. Shower valves shall be easily activated, and the shower head shall be the deluge type that delivers 30 to 60 gallons per minute at pressures of 20 to 50 pounds per square inch(psi) at the head. Every laboratory room or area shall have ready access to low pressure, aerated water for removing contaminantsWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-20 Effective 12/01/1999 from the eyes and, where possible, with the eyewash fountain co- located with the emergency shower. 4. Maintain all eyewash stations (ex. 01) in accordance with ANSI Z358.1 and inspect them per the manufacturer's instructions. Squeeze bottles also require frequent inspection and maintenance since they lose water to evaporation, become contaminated, andare easily misplaced (sec. 21.22). 61.25a - Emergency Evacuation Procedures and Communica- tions Plan. Employees shall be familiar with the Emergency Evacu- ation Procedures and Communications Plan, and of their duties in: 1. Sounding the alarm. 2. Operating emergency equipment.3. Evacuating to shelters or assembly points. 4. Notifying emergency response crews. 5. Having skills in rescue and first aid. Include provisions for advising emergency response crews of potential dangers when such crews are summoned. Keep emergency equipment in good working order.61.25 - Exhibit 01 - Emergency Eyewash StationWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-21 Effective 12/01/199961.25b - Emergency Guidelines. 1. Provide guidelines for all conceivable emergencies during which laboratory activities might be interrupted and for utility fail-ures. Include provisions for: a. Emergency ventilation and lighting. b. Cooling of chemical reactions.c. Personnel evacuation. d. Advising emergency response crews of potential dan- gers when such crews are summoned. 2. Conduct emergency drills at least twice a year. Ensure that the drills do not create hazards themselves. 61.26 - Safety Practices. Management shall ensure the safety and health of employees and the visiting public. Some chemical combinations are very reactive and can produce heat, generate gas, or detonate. Such reactivity generally can bepredicted. Sometimes chemicals must be combined in specific sequences. Before working with chemicals, laboratory employees shall review the applicable MSDS to know and recognize the poten-tial reactions of the chemicals being used and to know how to control these reactions. The toxicity of many chemicals has not been completely investi- gated. Lethal doses of some chemicals can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled into the lungs, and ingested through the mouth. The inhalation of toxic vapors and gases, skin contact, and poor housekeeping pose some of the greatest hazards when working with chemicals. PPE and safety devices do not provide complete protection. Care in handling chemicals is essential. Follow these safety practices. 1.Chemical Spills. Clean up chemical spills immediately, using approved procedures for disposal. 2.Removal of Stored Toxic Liquid Chemicals. Remove toxic liquid chemicals from large storage containers by a pump or si- phon, or by a pipette equipped with a rubber suction bulb. Do notstart siphons by mouth to remove liquid chemicals. Do not allow mouth pipetting.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-22 Effective 12/01/1999 3.Food Safety. Do not eat or drink in any room or area where there is danger of contamination by toxic or radioactive substances. Do not store food and beverages in laboratory refrigerators. Do notuse laboratory glassware for food or beverages. 4.Laboratory Glassware. Inspect glassware before and after use. If damaged, repair or discard. Do not pick up large glass con-tainers by their necks or rims. Hands must be dry when handling chemical containers. Do not stress any glass part when setting up an apparatus. Rinse or purge flammable or toxic residue fromglassware after use. 5.Mechanical Hazards. Operate equipment according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Secure appropriate guards andshields. Do not operate instruments or leave equipment unattended unless adequate safety measures are taken. All warning signs shall be clearly visible. Employees shall be familiar with all safety fea-tures. 6.Nonionizing Radiation. Mount appropriate eye protection or shields on instruments emitting nonionizing radiation. Post warn-ings. It is imperative that equipment or materials emitting high energy radiation be handled according to established radiation and radioisotope policy (FSM 6741). 7.Pressure and Vacuum Systems. Store compressed gases and handle them in a safe manner. Use safety shields to protect personnel from equipment that may explode or implode. Regulatoryand safety valves or controls must be maintained and regularly inspected as prescribed by the manufacturer. 8.Thermal Hazards. Wherever there are high or low tempera- ture areas in the laboratory, install suitable insulation and warning signs. Employees working with high or low temperatures shall use adequate safety clothing. Never leave high temperature ovens orfurnaces unattended unless they are equipped with temperature control and warning signs. 9.Electrical Hazards. Ensure that wiring meets National Electrical Code standards as required in classified areas where hazardous materials are stored and used.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-23 Effective 12/01/1999All electrical equipment, wiring, switches, controls, and posted signs shall comply with NFPA 70 (ex. 01). 10.Infectious Hazards. Ensure that personnel using poten- tially hazardous microorganisms are trained in safety and health measures, and that they conduct their laboratory activities in accor- dance with the level of risk. a. Keep laboratories clean. Disinfectants identified as effective against organisms being handled shall be HIGH VOLTAGE KEEP OUTDANGERDANGER ELECTRICAL HAZARD! DANGER LOCK-OUT EQUIPMENT BEFORE SERVICING!61.26 - Exhibit 01 - Electrical Hazard SignsWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-24 Effective 12/01/1999 available in each laboratory and used routinely on work surfaces. Disinfect equipment for handling hazardous biological materials before it is discarded or reused. b. Do not eat or drink in laboratories where biohazardous materials are used or stored. Always wash hands after working with microorganisms. c. Label all pathogens properly for ready identification (29 CFR 1910.1030). d. Pipetting of hazardous microorganisms or toxic fluids shall be done only by bulb or other nonmouth devices. Do not blow infectious fluids out of pipettes. e. Perform all work with hazardous microorganisms or toxic fluids on plastic-backed absorbent material. 11.Animal Hazards. Practice good personal hygiene and housekeeping techniques when caring for and working with ani-mals. Use PPE to reduce the possibility of infection through a skin break, the respiratory tract, or through contact with excreta. 61.3 - Greenhouse Safety.61.31 - Procedures. Develop a safety and health plan that in- cludes: 1. Supervision responsibility.2. Periodic inspection. 3. Use of hazardous materials. 4. Emergency evacuation procedures and communication plan. 5. Equipment use. 6. Accident investigation and reporting. 61.32 - Safety Practices. JHAs are required for all greenhouse work projects and activities. 61.32a - Operations. 1. Do not use soil amendments containing pathogenic micro- organisms (such as Sporotrichum schenckii , the cause of sporotri- chosis) as a potting medium or for packing nursery stock. ThisWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-25 Effective 12/01/1999prohibition applies especially to fresh, nondecomposed sphagnum moss that is often infested with S. schenckii . The prohibition does not apply to decomposed sphagnum peat moss sold commercially. 2. Wear a respirator when working with dry soil amendments like peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite (sec. 21.13). 3. Keep aisles and passageways clear. Do not obstruct exits with stored materials. 4. Consider fire characteristics when storing materials. 61.32b - Pesticides. Only licensed or certified persons are permit- ted to apply restricted-use pesticides. Refer to sections 22.11 and 61.7 for additional information. 1. Use only registered pest control chemicals. Apply all pesti- cides according to label instructions and use required PPE. 2. When using smoke fumigators, post warning signs on all greenhouse doors to indicate: a. What fumigants will be used. b. When fumigation will be done. c. Who will be allowed access. 61.32c - Equipment. Safety equipment, first aid kits, safety show- ers, and fire extinguishers must be readily available for emergen- cies. Employees shall be trained in the use of such equipment. 61.32d - Electrical. All electrical work shall be done in compliance with the NFPA 70 and State or local safety codes. 1. Because greenhouses are often damp, use double insula- tion and ground-fault circuit breakers to prevent shocks. 2. Schedule routine inspection of all electrical cords. Do not use worn or frayed extension cords. 61.4 - Incompatible Chemicals. Organize storage so there are separate areas for solvents, corrosive liquids, strongly oxidizing agents, and the remaining chemicals.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-26 Effective 12/01/1999 Partial List of Incompatible Chemicals Chemical Incompatibles Acetic acid Chromic acid, ethylene glycol, hydroxyl-containing chlorine, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid Acetylene Bromine, chlorine, copper tubing, mercury, silver, fluorine, and iodine Alkaline and alkaline Carbon dioxide, chlorinated earth metals, such as hydrocarbons, and watercalcium, cesium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, andsodium Aluminum and its Acid or alkaline solutions, ammonium alloys (particularly persulphate and water, chlorates,powders) chlorinated compounds, nitrates, and organic compounds in nitrate/nitrate salt baths Ammonia (anhydrous) Bromine, calcium hypochlorite, chlorine, hydrofluoric acid, iodine, mercury, and silver Ammonium nitrate Acids, chlorates, chlorides, lead, metallic nitrates, metal powders, finely organics orcombustibles, sulfur, and zinc Ammonium Combustible materials; oxidizing perchlorate such as acids, persulfate (continued)WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page Chemicals (contd.)

This area for solvents should be close to the floor with adequate ventilation to carry off any vapors. Store flammables only in the cabinets designed for flammable storage. 61.42 - Area 2 - Corrosive Materials. Corrosive materials react with other substances causing erosion and destruction of structural efficacy. Besides acids, such materials include acid anhydrides andalkalies. These materials often destroy their containers and there- fore the integrity of the container and its label must be checked often. Acids are corrosive and produce hydrogen gas when they contact metals in the storage area. Alkalies in contact with alumi- num liberate hydrogen. Keep these materials close to, but not on, the floor. Do not store them in cabinets that contain gas pipes. Separate acids and strong bases by placing them at opposite ends of the cabinet or shelf. Also, organic acids react violently with strongly oxidizing mineralacids. Use spill trays under containers; use separate spill trays for incompatible chemicals. After using a chemical, return the con- tainer to its proper storage location. Segregate acids away from substances that react with them or their mists to evolve heat, hydrogen, or explosive gases. Reactive mate- rials in this category include those listed in exhibit 01. 61.42 - Exhibit 01 - Reactive Corrosive Materials lithium nitrides cyanides sodium materials above phosphidesWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-33 Effective 12/01/199961.43 - Area 3 - Strong Oxidizing Agents. Oxidizing agents are solids, liquids, or gases that yield oxygen or other oxidizing gas during the course of a chemical reaction or that readily react tooxidize combustible materials. When containers of oxidizing materi- als are damaged and then allowed to mix with other chemicals, such as flammables, a fire or explosion may occur. 1. Common strong oxidizing agents include: \u2014 chlorates \u2014 many other chemicals) \u2014 halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine) 2. Separate the agents listed in paragraph 1 from: \u2014 combustible materials\u2014 organic solvents (even high flashpoint) \u2014 metal powders \u2014 metal hydrides\u2014 phosphorus Take special precautions if highly hazardous compounds are to be stored, such as fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. For example, se-cure small cylinders of halogen gases in a fume hood. 3. Store the following materials in a manner that prevents reaction with moisture, which creates hydrogen gas: \u2014 lithium \u2014 rubidium \u2014 sodium\u2014 potassium \u2014 calcium \u2014 cesium\u2014 alloys, amalgams and hydrides of the aboveWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-34 Effective 12/01/1999 4. Similarly, the following materials can react with moisture to produce flammable and sometimes spontaneously explosive hy- drides: \u2014 nitrides \u2014 tellurides \u2014 arsenides 5. Certain materials react with moisture to evolve heat, including: \u2014 concentrated acids \u2014 concentrated alkalies\u2014 acid anhydrides 6. Be careful in the storage of materials that ignite easily under normal conditions, such as: \u2014 finely divided metals \u2014 phosphorus \u2014 hydrides of boron\u2014 flammable gases \u2014 sodium \u2014 solvents with flash points below 20 oF (6-1/2 oC) Take special precautions in the storage of peroxidizable com- pounds. The degree of danger varies considerably with the struc- ture of the peroxide. In some cases they may undergo anaccelerating self-reaction that can be violent. Organic peroxides have combined oxidizing and combustible properties. Incompatible materials can initiate, catalyze, or accelerate the decomposition oforganic peroxides. Refer to NFPA 43B for further information. 61.44 - Area 4 - Remaining Chemicals. Store chemicals on lipped shelves or in cabinets based on their compatibility (ex. 01,sec. 61.4). Store them within easy reach of the people using them. 61.5 - Flammable/Combustible Liquids. Flammable liquids are dangerous when they are in open containers, when they leak orspill, or when they are heated. The degree of danger is determinedWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-35 Effective 12/01/1999by the flash point, whether the vapor-air mixture is in an explosive range, and the possibility of a source of ignition. Identifying the hazard class of flammable liquids is often difficult. Smell is not a reliable indication, but a strong odor is a signal that investigation is needed. The distinction between a flammable liquid and a combustible liquid lies in the ease with which the liquid gives off flammable vapors (ex. 01). For example, gasoline, alcohol, and acetone are flam- mable. Lubricating, vegetable, or fish oils, and glycerin are combus-tible. Any combustible liquid, heated sufficiently or dispersed in a fine spray where small particles are mixed with air, becomes flam- mable (ex. 02). 61.5 - Exhibit 01 - Flashpoint and Boiling Point of Flammable and Combustible Liquids Flash Boiling Liquid Point Point Class \u00b0F (\u00b0C) \u00b0F (\u00b0C) Example Flammable Liquids 1 (23\u00b0C) Below 100 \u00b0F (38\u00b0C) 73 \u00b0F (23\u00b0C) 100 \u00b0F and above Gasoline 1 C 73 \u00b0F and below Turpentine 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) Combustible Liquids and Oil #1 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C) III A 140 \u00b0F and below Pine Oil 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C) III B 200 \u00b0F (93.3\u00b0C) Transformer and above OilWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-36 Effective 12/01/199961.5 - Exhibit 02 - Fire Hazard Properties of Flammable/Combustible Liquids, Gases, and Volatile Solids (Condensed from NFPA 325M)Hazard Class(H = Health, Flammable/ Flash Ignition Flammable Limits F = FlammabilityCombustible Point Temperature Percent by Volume R = Reactivity)Liquid \u00b0F (\u00b0C) \u00b0F (\u00b0C) Lower Upper H F acid (Glacial) 103 (39) 867 (463) 4.0 19.9 2 2 1 Acetone -4 (-20) 869 (465) 2.5 12.8 1 3 0 Amyl acetate 60 (16) 680 (360) 1.1 7.5 1 3 0 Amyl alcohol 91 (33) 572 (300) 1.2 10.0 1 3 0 Aniline 158 (70) 1139 (615) 1.3 3 2 0 Benzene (Benzol) 12 (-11) 928 (498) 1.2 7.8 2 3 0Butyl alcohol (Butanol) 98 (37) 650 (343) 1.4 11.2 1 3 0 Carbon disulfide -22 (-30) 194 (90) 1.3 50.0 2 3 0 Corn oil 490(254) 740 (393) 0 1 0Creosote oil 165 (74) 637 (336) 2 2 0 Ethyl acetate 24 (-4) 800 (426) 2.0 11.5 1 3 0 Ethyl alcohol 55 (13) 685 (363) 3.3 19.0 0 3 0Ethyl chloride -58 (-50) 966 (519) 3.8 Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-37 Effective 12/01/1999Ethylene dichloride 56 (13) (413) 6.2 16.0 2 3 0 Ethyl ether -49 (-45) 356 (180) 1.9 36.0 2 4 1Ethylene oxide -20 (-29) 1058 (570) 3.0 100.0 2 4 3 Gasoline (low octane) -45 (-43) 536 (280) 1.4 7.6 1 3 0 Hexane -7 (-22) 437 (225) 1.1 7.5 1 3 0Hydrocyanic acid 0 (-18) 1000 (538) 5.6 40.0 4 4 2 Kerosene 100 (43) 410 (210) 0.7 5.0 0 2 0 Lard oil 395(202) 833 (445) 0 1 0Methyl acetate 14 (-10) 850 (454) 3.1 16.0 1 3 0 Methyl alcohol 52 (11) 867 (464) 6.0 36.0 1 3 0 Methyl ethyl ketone 16 (-9) 759 (404) 1.4 11.4 1 3 0Naphtha, coal tar 107 (42) 531 (277) 2 2 0(continued)61.5 - Exhibit 02 - Fire Hazard Properties of Flammable/Combustible Liquids, Gases, and Volatile Solids (Condensed from NFPA 325M) (contd.)Hazard Class(H = Health, Flammable/ Flash Ignition Flammable Limits F = FlammabilityCombustible Point Temperature Percent by Volume R = Reactivity)Liquid \u00b0F (\u00b0C) \u00b0F (\u00b0C) Lower Effective 12/01/1999Naphtha, varnish markers' and painters' 28 (-2) 450 (232) 0.9 6.0 1 3 0 Petroleum ether (Bezin) 0 (-18) 550 (288) 1.1 5.9 1 4 0 Phenol (Carbolic acid) 175 (79) 1319 (715) 1.8 8.6 3 2 0Pine oil 172 (78) 0 2 0 Propyl alcohol (Propanol) 74 (23) 775 (412) 2.2 13.7 1 3 0 Quenching oil 365(185) 0 1 0Toluene 40 (4) 896 (480) 1.1 7.1 2 3 0 Transformer oil 295(146) 0 1 0 Turpentine 95 (35) 488 (253) 0.8 1 3 061.5 - Exhibit 02 - Fire Hazard Properties of Flammable/Combustible Liquids, Gases, and Volatile Solids (Condensed from NFPA 325M) (contd.)Hazard Class(H = Health, Flammable/ Flash Ignition Flammable Limits F = FlammabilityCombustible Point Temperature Percent by Volume R = Reactivity)Liquid \u00b0F (\u00b0C) \u00b0F (\u00b0C) Lower Page 60-39 Effective 12/01/1999The flammability hazard depends to a certain extent on the liquid exposed and the volume of the room or building. In a large, open room, a small quantity of flammable liquid may not produce suffi-cient vapors to make the atmosphere flammable except in the immediate vicinity. If the quantity is sufficient to make the entire atmosphere flammable, a further increase in quantity may notincrease the hazard, but does provide more fuel for continuing fire. Minimum flash points for fuel oils of various grades are: No. 1 and 2, 100 oF (38 oC); No. 4, 110 oF (43 oC); No. 5, 130 oF (54 oC); No. 6, 150 oF (65-1/2 oC) or higher (ex. 02). Actual flash points are com- monly higher and are required to be higher by some State laws. No. 1 fuel oil is often sold as kerosene, range oil, or coal oil. 61.51 - Special Concerns. 61.51a - Density. With few exceptions (carbon disulfide is one), flammable liquids are lighter than water and can float on the water'ssurface. Some flammable liquids, such as acetone and alcohol, however, can dissolve in and completely mix with water. 61.51b - Vapor Density. Vapor density is the volume weight of pure gas compared to an equal volume weight of dry air. A figure greater than 1 indicates that a gas is heavier than air. This means that any escaped vapors settle downward onto floors and flow withair currents around corners and down stairs or shafts to pool in low spots. If the source liquid is open and a continuous supply of vapor is flowing, a spark anywhere along the vapor trail (perhaps hundreds of feet or several floors away) can set off an explosion and a fire that may envelop an entire building almost instantly. 61.51c - Toxicity. Trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, and similar nonflammable solvents are more toxic than gasoline or naphtha. Nontoxic, noncorrosive, nonflammable, nonacidic, noncausticsolvents that are biodegradable are recommended for substitution when possible (FSM 2160, 2162.2, and 2163.5). 61.51d - Storage. Specific standards for storing flammable/com- bustible liquids are in NFPA 30 and 395, 29 CFR 1910.106 and 1910.144, and ANSI Z5351-91. Refer further direction.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-40 Effective 12/01/1999 Do not allow sources of ignition where flammable liquids are stored or used, or where there is a possibility of leaks from piping or storage containers. One common precautionary measure is toensure that there is no open-flame heating. Provide explosion-proof electrical wiring and equipment for hazardous (classified) locations (NFPA 70). Treat unmarked containers of liquid as flammable. 1.Outside Above-ground Tanks. Such tanks are used for large quantity storage. Approved tanks must be vented, protected from physical damage, and signed. Tank design, construction, andlocation shall be in compliance with regulations in 29 CFR 1910.106. 2.Containers and Portable Tanks. Generally, the quantity of flammable or combustible liquids to be stored in individual drums or other containers shall not exceed 60 gallons (227 L); individual portable tanks shall not exceed 660 gallons (2498 L). For specificrequirements, refer to 29 CFR 1910.106(d). 3.Inside Storage. All doors must open outward from flam- mable/combustible liquid storage areas. Post appropriate signsinside and outside buildings and locations storing flammables. Prohibit open flames or sparks within 50 feet (15-1/2 m) of flam- mables. Provide positive ventilation to prevent accumulation ofvapors. Protect electric light bulbs to avoid accidental breakage. Fixtures and switches must be vapor- and spark-proof or explosion-proof where explosion hazards exist. 4.Incidental Storage or Use of Flammable/Combustible Liquids. Adequate precautions must be taken to prevent the igni- tion of flammable vapors. Sources of ignition include, but are notlimited to, open flames; lightning; smoking; cutting and welding; electrical and mechanical sparks; spontaneous ignition, including heat producing chemical reactions; and radiant heat. a. Store such liquids in an NFPA-approved storage cabinet and label it \"Flammable - Keep Fire Away.\" b. Do not store more than 60 gallons (227 L) of Class I or Class II liquids in a storage cabinet. c. Use an NFPA-approved safety container for storing and dispensing small quantities of flammable liquids. Theapproved container for this purpose shall have not more than a 5-gallon capacity, shall have a spring-closing lidWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-41 Effective 12/01/1999and a spout cover, and shall be designed so it safely relieves internal pressure when subjected to fire expo- sure (ex. 01, sec. 61.5). d. Do not use a safety container that leaks when upright or leaks more than 4 drops per minute when inverted. Do not weld or solder these containers . Destroy defective safety containers. e. Always place a portable fuel container on the ground prior to filling to dissipate static electricity. Bed linerscreate excellent insulation, preventing static electricity from bleeding off the gas can to the truck body, through the tires, and to the ground. Static is generated from theflow of gasoline through the hose, and when the nozzle is removed from the gas can, a spark can cause the vapors to ignite. f. Do not store more than one day's supply of gasoline or other flammable liquid on equipment, unless the vehicle is a fuel supply truck that is properly placarded, labeled,and designed for that purpose. g. Keep gasoline in warehouses with assembled fire-sup- pression units only if not more than one 5-gallon (19 L)can is assigned to each unit. Such storage must also conform with local laws and not exceed 25 gallons (94-1/ 2 L). When the fire season is over, remove gasoline cansfrom the units and store them in approved flammable storage buildings or cabinets. h. Never store flammable/combustible liquids in office areas, except those required for maintenance and opera- tion of building and equipment. Such storage must be in closed metal containers in a storage cabinet or in safetycontainers. i. Store kerosene in dwellings in 2-gallon (7-1/2 L) closed safety containers. Storage shall be away from flamesand sparks and in locations where the temperature is below 100 oF (38 oC). j.Do not store or transport flammables and radio equipment in the same truck compartment or stor- age building. Do not dispose of flammable/combustible liquids in sewer drains, storm drains, or floor drains.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-42 Effective 12/01/1999 k. Provide portable fire extinguisher(s), and control equip- ment in such quantities and types as are needed for the special hazards of operation and storage. l. Ensure that all fire protection equipment and supplies are adequately maintained and periodically inspected and tested by a competent person to ensure they are insatisfactory operating condition and will serve their purpose in time of emergency. m. Always maintain unobstructed aisles, stairways, pas- sageways, and exits for movement of personnel. n. Ensure that maintenance and operating practices are in accordance with established procedures that tend tocontrol leakage and prevent accidental escape of flam- mable or combustible liquids. 61.51e - Dispensing. 1.General Safety. Ensure that all handling and dispensing of flammable liquids is done in a well-ventilated area free of sources of ignition, and provide bonding between the dispensing equipmentand the container being filled. a. Use dispensing pumps approved by the Underwriters' Laboratories (UL) or Factory Mutual Liability InsuranceCompany of America. Pumps generally are the best means of withdrawing flammable liquids from tanks or drums because the flow can be controlled. b. Where faucets are used on tanks or drums, provide the spring-closing type that flow only while manually held open. Blocking such faucets open is not permitted. c. Ground and bond gravity flow dispensing units to pre- vent a build up of static electricity (ex. 01). 2.Cleanliness. Cleanliness is essential where combustible or flammable liquids are handled. a. Wipe up spilled gasoline, kerosene, or oil at once. b. Use sand, dry earth, or special oil-absorbent compound, not sawdust, to soak up spills. Wash off any part of the body that has been exposed to petroleum products immediately. c. Keep combustible waste material and residues to a minimum. Store them in covered metal receptacles, and dispose of them daily.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-43 Effective 12/01/199961.51e - Exhibit 01 - Grounding and Bonding Wire mesh flame arresterFlexible dispensinghoseValve bodyCombination fill opening andrelief ventCarrying handle is pulled back to openpouring valve andrear cap Container color-red Yellow stripe Grounding and Bonding Grounding and Bonding Spill ContainmentType II Safety CanWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-44 Effective 12/01/1999 d.

Do not dispense gasoline in enclosed buildings.b. Post flammable material signs on the outside of gasoline storage buildings. Prohibit all flammable material within 50 feet (15-1/2 m) of the dispensing station and build-ings. c. When filling tanks, leave vapor above the liquid level to permit expansion with rising temperatures. d. Shut engines off and set the parking brake before filling fuel tanks on vehicles or equipment. e. Ground the delivery hose or gasoline container before contacting the hose nozzle or can spout against the container being filled. f. Do not fill portable containers while they are located inside the trunk, in the passenger compartment of a vehicle, or in a pickup truck with a bed liner. g. Do not use static-generating materials to wipe up spilled gasoline or flammables. h. Provide gasoline dispensing units and buildings with explosion-proof wiring, switched, outlets, and lights.Ensure that electrical maintenance does not compro- mise explosion-proof wiring or fixtures. i. Use dispensing hoses of the retractable type and protect them from physical damage. 61.6 - Flammable Gases. 61.61 - General Safety. Flammable gases generally present haz- ards similar to flammable liquids. Gases that mix with air burn rapidly and explode if there is an ignition source. Refer to NFPA 58 for specific information on storage and handling (ex. 01). The density of a gas affects its behavior when it escapes and consequently affects its hazard. Heavier gases have a greater probability of coming in contact with sources of ignition (ex. 02). Some gases are odorized to assist in detecting their presence, but smell is only a rough estimator of the hazard.WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-45 Effective 12/01/1999Color Odor Weight Compared When When Flammable Gas to Air Breathed Shipped State Effect Physical Remarks Acetylene None Garlic-like Lighter Yes Anesthetic Dissolved Wide e xplosive range when mixed with air oroxygen Compressed None None Same No None Gas Supports Air combustion Ammonia None Pungent Lighter Yes Irritant Liquid Does not support combustion Argon None None Heavier No None Gas Does not support combustion Carbon None Faint Much No None Liquid Does not Dioxide heavier support combustion (continued)61.61 - Exhibit 01 - Characteristics of Gases in Common UseWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-46 Effective 12/01/1999 Color Odor Weight Compared When When Flammable Gas to Air Breathed Shipped State Effect Physical Remarks61.61 - Exhibit 01 - Characteristics of Gases in Common Use (contd.)

Before using or disposing of any pesticide, check with the responsible Forest Service Pesticide Coordinator. Theproject planner, handler, user, and applicator are responsible for safety in use of pesticides. Direction on the specific hazards encountered by exposure through handling, mixing, and application and preventive measures is in FSM 2167.12. Follow the direction in FSM 2150; chapter 40 of FSH 2109.14; and sections 22.1 and 61.32b of this Handbook to ensureproper storage, transportation, disposal, and handling of pesticides. 61.71 - Safety Practices. Do not use a pesticide without following the information on the label or MSDS. Apply pesticides so that they do not endanger humans, livestock, crops, beneficial insects, fish, or wildlife. Avoid inhaling pesticide sprays or dusts. Do not apply pesticides when there is danger ofdrift that may contaminate water or leave illegal residues. Wear PPE as identified by the MSDS, JHA, or manufacturer. 61.71a - Storage. Store pesticides that are flammable/combustible liquids in accordance with NFPA 30 and 395. Store pesticides that are oxidizing agents in accordance with NFPA 43A. 1. Do not store pesticide quantities exceeding 200 gallons (757 L) with other flammable materials. 2. Store all pesticides in the original labeled container. Never store unused pesticides in a food, feed, medicine, or beveragecontainer. 3. Frequently check containers for leaks, tears, or loose lids. If containers are in poor condition, put contents in a suitable con-WO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-51 Effective 12/01/1999tainer and label properly. Protect the labels of pesticide containers so that they remain legible. 4. Always store pesticides in rooms away from food, feed, or water. Segregate and store each pesticide formulation under a sign containing the name of the formulation. 5. Never store combustible materials in direct sunlight. Exces- sive heat or extreme cold adversely affect some chemicals, so check the MSDS and the label for special storage requirements. 6. Store herbicides away from other pesticides or fertilizers. 61.71b - Transportation of Pesticides. Pesticides labeled with the signal words \"Danger Poison\" (skull and cross bones) or \"Warning\" are considered highly or moderately toxic, respectively. Transportthese pesticides to and from the worksite, with any related equip- ment, outside the passenger-carrying portion of vehicles, such as in trailers and pickup beds. Pesticides labeled \"Caution\" are considered slightly toxic and, when necessary, may be transported inside the passenger-carrying portion of vehicles. In all transportation situations, the following apply: 1. All pesticide drums, cans, bottles, and jugs shall be se- curely capped and protected from breakage or spillage. Ripped orpunctured bags or cardboard containers will be put into plastic bags, or otherwise contained, to prevent leakage. 2. Pesticide containers and application equipment, such as a hypo-hatchet or tree injectors, shall be stored in the vehicle in a locked, leakproof case or enclosure. Label the case or enclosure to identify the contents and potential hazard. Separate the case orenclosure from people, and securely anchor it to the vehicle to minimize damage or spillage in the event of an accident. Pesticides shall not be transported in application equipment. 3. Original pesticide containers shall display the EPA approved label. 4. Service containers (any container used to hold, store, or transport a pesticide concentrate or diluted preparation, other thanWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-52 Effective 12/01/1999 the original labeled container) shall be labeled as follows: a.Pesticide Concentrate: (1) Product name.(2) EPA registration number. (3) Name and percentage of active ingredient. (4) Signal word(s) from registered label. b.Diluted Preparation: (1) Product name preceded by the word \"Diluted.\" (2) EPA registration number preceded by the words \"Derived From.\" (3) Name and percent of active ingredient as diluted. (4) Signal word(s) from registered label. 61.71c - Disposal. When transporting or shipping pesticides or pesticide containers for the purpose of disposal (FSM 2167.12), the following apply: 1. The containers must be clearly marked \"This product is for disposal only\" in addition to the registered product label. 2. When the registered label is unreadable, an ingredient statement is required. When the ingredients are not known, a state- ment to that effect must appear on the containers. 3. Each container must bear the name, address, and tele- phone number of the person to be contacted in case of an accident or emergency. 4. If the container contains a highly toxic substance, a warning of the potential hazard (such as a skull and crossbones label) shall be prominently displayed in red. Some States may have unique requirements regarding the trans- portation of pesticides for disposal. Contact lead State agencies before transporting the material. 61.8 - Asbestos. Asbestos is used in the manufacture of heat- resistant clothing, automotive brake and clutch linings, and a vari- ety of building materials. Exposure occurs when the asbestos containing material is abraded or otherwise disturbed. Forest Service employees may be exposed to asbestos when working with brake drums in motor vehicle repair shopsWO Amendment 6709.11-99-1 Page 60-53 Effective 12/01/1999(sec. 39.74a) or when working in buildings with asbestos insulation or pipe coverings. Activities involving friable asbestos-containing materials shall be performed by individuals accredited through theEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Asbestos Model Accredi- tation Plan (MAP) or an EPA-approved State accredited training program. The accreditation and training requirements are applicableto all Forest Service employees, volunteers, SCSEP personnel, and contractors. Forest Service employees shall not remove friable asbestos products (FSM 6743.2). No employee shall be exposed to asbestos above the permissible exposure limits (PELs). 61.81 - Procedures. 1. Before beginning remodeling work on facilities, a competent person shall check for the presence of asbestos containing materi- als. a. If asbestos exposure is suspected, take air samples to determine the extent of contamination, if any. b. If air samples identify asbestos in the air, notify and provide protection for workers. Engineering controls that remove or enclose the asbestos are the best methods. Administrative controls, such as decreasing or eliminat-ing employee exposure by moving employees or chang- ing work schedules, are acceptable. 2. Refer to 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1926.58 for spe- cific exposure monitoring; regulated areas; methods of compliance; respiratory protection; protective work clothing and equipment; hygiene facilities and practices; communi-cations of hazards to employees (training); housekeeping; and medical surveillance, record keeping, and observation of monitor- ing. 61.9 - Lead. Employees occupationally exposed to lead during construction work projects and activities shall comply with the requirements in 29 CFR 1926.62.
