And they are critical for human health and animal health alike. As someone working in science side of agriculture and also a parent of a child with autism, I am going to offer a firm view. Not only are vaccines safe, they are true scientific innovations in both human health and animal health. And obviously so very true right now when we need vaccine innovations more than ever. I want to go a step further. Foods don't cause autism either. My son eats all kinds of foods and always has-- meats, dairy, vegetables etc... and he gets his nutrition from these foods and is doing great as a result. It bothers me when people act like certain foods cause autism, given both my position as an advocate for agriculture and for my son with autism.

Also, as you know from dealing with chemical companies, \"retail\" science is corrupt and pharmaceutical companies are no better than chemical companies. Science is only as honest as the people practicing it. You've built a company off the idea that the \"big guys\" are exploiting farmers. You honestly think pharmaceutical companies aren't doing the same thing? [Andrew Blake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgblake?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)2y Agree. Lots of misinformation out there ..... uniformed/under-educated people take as \"truth\" without doing due diligence. The Doctor Who Fooled the World by Brian Deer should be required reading until this myth is gone Thank you for posting this. Far too often public opinion on health and nutrition is predicated on anecdotal evidence lacking any sort of rigorous scientific inspection. Examples abound. When these casual observations influence policy they become impediments to scientific progress. [Michael Hart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhart4th?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)2y I also have a son with autism and could not agree more. Thank you for your firm view [Amol Deshpande](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amol-deshpande-2364b81?trk=public_post_comment-text)! New research also shows that getting general vaccines may also have some protective effects on reducing covid infections. That is not even with the covid vaccine. Vaccines work and have very few side effects.
