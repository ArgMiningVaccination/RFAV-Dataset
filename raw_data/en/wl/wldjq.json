It binds to the opiate receptor in the gut wall which inhibits the release of acetylcholine and prostaglandins. By doing this it slows down peristalsis (movement of your intestinal muscles) and increases the amount of time it takes the byproducts of digestion to move through your intestine. Your body is able to retain more fluid and sodium and helps make your stools less soft. It also increases the tone of the anal sphincter which reduces incontinence and urgency. How this Medication Comes Loperamide comes as a caplet, softgel, and liquid solution, all of which are taken by mouth. How to Take Loperamide The dose and how often you take this medication depends on your treatment and how severe your diarrhea is.
