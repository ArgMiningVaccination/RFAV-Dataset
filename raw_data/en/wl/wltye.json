The Clean Simple Eats team develops products that are engineered to make eating a healthy, balanced diet simple, tasty, and stress-free. Remember when protein powder was for bodybuilders and bros only? And it tasted like chunky cardboard that you had to choke down if you wanted to achieve those gains? Yea, me too. Thankfully, times are changing and protein powders, workout supplements, and weightlifting are now widely recognized as being for every member of the population. Of course, this means that there are now approximately one million companies to weed through as you decide how and where to get your workout supplements and healthy living advice. I'll be honest, I've tried many supplement brands over the years, and some are most definitely better than others. But the beautiful thing is that some brands are taking on so much more than just creating supplements, they're creating lifestyles built around healthy, sustainable habits. This is exactly what Clean Simple Eats is all about. While I originally heard of this brand by purchasing their famed protein powder to try, once I get involved, I realized that there is so much more to the brand than just a few supplements. In this article, I'm sharing everything you need to know about Clean Simple Eats, its products, brand mission, and finally giving my honest opinion on whether or not this brand is worth investing in.

Clean Simple Eats is a nutrition, wellness, and supplement brand that offers a wide range of products and services to help customers live and eat well. CSE began as a brand that offered macro-friendly meal plans designed for those who were bored and fed up with the same bland, boring diet foods. CSE founders, and husband-wife duo Erika and JJ, had a desire to create delicious, family-friendly recipes that contain just the right amount of protein, carbs, and fats so that families could eat well knowing that they were getting the fuel that they needed. The goal has always been to show people that the most effective diet plan is one that's sustainable and enjoyable. Thanks to the success of the recipes, Clean Simple Eats expanded to offer its very own line of clean and delicious protein powders, supplements, and nut butters with the goal of creating the best-tasting and highest-quality products on the market. Recently, the brand took things to the next level by offering a clean, curated meal delivery serving that offers macro-friendly meals right to your doorstep as well as the CSE+ App which includes 800+ macro-based recipes and meal planning. Today, Clean Simple Eats is a well-established, extremely popular brand amongst those who count macros and who desire to live a fit, healthy life while enjoying clean products and tasty meals. Pros - Impeccably high-quality ingredients - Delicious protein powders in a variety of unique flavors - Small, family-run brand - CSE App includes hundreds of macro-friendly meals and meal planning features - Fresh meal delivery is available - All products and services are made and delivered with integrity and a legitimate desire to help you sustain a healthy lifestyle Cons - Prices are a tad higher than some alternatives (but you get what you pay for) - Products (like protein and supplements) are only available from the website Get 10% off with coupon code: TAMI What Products and Services Are Available? Clean Simple Eats is becoming a true lifestyle brand that's helping to take the stress, guesswork, and boredom out of eating a clean, healthy, and sustainable diet. CSE currently offers the following: Products and Supplements - Protein Powder - Nut Butter - Collagen - Pancakes - Super Powders (Greens and Reds) - Kids Supplements - Digestive Enzymes - Probiotics - Vitamin D - Omega 3 Recipes - Recipe Books - CSE+ App Meal Delivery - CSE Kitchen Clean Simple Eats Protein Powder Review Perhaps the most popular and well-known product coming from the Clean Simple Eats team to date is their protein powder. Admittedly, this was the first product I ever tried from the brand and it came to me via a recommendation from an Instagram influencer. As we all know, this can go one of two ways, and thankfully, I was very happy with my purchase. CSE offers a full line of protein powders to choose from, each one is made to be healthy and effective while maintaining one of the richest, creamiest textures amongst whey protein powder options. Plus, it's naturally sweetened and made from premium ingredients like grass-fed whey. The whey is cold-pressed from start to finish, allowing all of the nutrients to stay intact so that your body gets every last gram of the 20 grams of protein per serving. Furthermore, there's also an added enzyme blend that aids in digestion, helping your system to break down the fuel into usable amino acids. And these protein powders are completely free of any junk or artificial ingredients, so you can feel great about your choice to go with CSE protein powder. Highlights - 20 g of grass-fed, cold-processed whey protein per serving - 0 artificial sweeteners/flavors - 0 artificial colors/dyes - 0 artificial preservatives - Macro-friendly - Amazing taste - Rich, creamy texture - Can be used as a protein shake, for baking, and for dozens of other recipes Flavor Options - Simply Vanilla - Brownie Batter - Cotton Candy - Vanilla Cola - Cookies N Cream - Mint Chocolate Cookie - Cinnamon Roll - Snickerdoodle - Strawberry Cheesecake - S'Mores - Bananas Foster - Chocolate Peanut Butter - Maple Donut - Coconut CreamCake Batter - Peaches and Cream - Vegan Chocolate - Caramel Toffee - Key Lime Pie - Vegan Vanilla Off Beat Nut Butter If you love nut butter, you're in for a treat. Off Beat Butters from Clean Simple Eats are delicious and full of healthy fats. All of CSE's nut butters are naturally gluten and dairy-free and contain only the highest quality ingredients. With a wide variety of natural flavorings and extracts in these nut butters, each jar is a flavor experience like no other. These butters are perfect for topping your toast, waffles, pancakes, yogurt, oatmeal, or even just eating by the spoonful (my preferred method.) Each blend is smooth, creamy, and far more decadent than any average jar of store-bought nut butter. Flavor Options - Cinnamon Bun - Salted Caramel - Mint Chocolate Chip Cookie - Sweet Classic Peanut Butter - Aloha - Candy Bar - Gingerbread Cookie - Midnight Almond Coconut - Lemon Coconut Bliss - Monkey Business - Almond Mocha - Maple Donut - Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup - Buckeye Brownie - Crunchy Almond Toffee - Caramel Pecan Cluster Collagen Collagen is a staple in my diet and one of the only supplements that I take year-round. Clean Simple Eats Collagen powder is one of the best options for strengthening your joints, hair, skin, and nails. CSE offers collagen in multiple flavor options, including unflavored, so that you can choose where and how you consume your daily collagen. This blend is low in calories and high in protein, giving you a nice bang for your buck. The unflavored option is perfect for discreetly adding to your smoothies, coffee, yogurt, pancakes, etc. And the flavored options make drinking a glass of water that much more fun, delicious, and nutritious. Flavor Options - Unflavored - Peach Mango - Blackberry Lemonaid - Blue Hawaii - Cucumber Lime Greens and Reds We're all aware of how beneficial eating (or drinking) our greens is. But trying to fit it all into your diet is tough and traditional greens powders taste terrible, which is why Clean Simple Eats has set out to change that narrative but offering a Peach flavored Super Greens Mix in addition to their original flavored mix. Super Greens Mix from CSE stands apart from the giant pack of greens powders on the market by offering ingredients that are ethically and organically sourced and then cold-pressed to offer the highest quality greens available. Plus, they offer very competitive prices on their greens and reds Super Berry Mix formulas.
