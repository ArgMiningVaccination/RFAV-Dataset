This culture must encourage everyone in the organization to share concerns immedi ately. We must never sacrifice ethical and compliant behavior in the pursuit of busi ness objectives. Our Responsibility to Our Patients Quality of Care and Patient Safety We are committed to the delivery of safe, effective, efficient, compassionate and satisfying patient care. We treat all patients with warmth, respect and di gnity and provide care that is both necessary and appropriate.

Patient Rights We ensure appropriate care for all patients. We make no distinc tion in the availability of services; the admission, transfer or discharge of a patient; or in the care we provide based on age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, race, color, re ligion, national origin, and ability to pay or type of insurance. We recognize and respect t he diverse backgrounds and cultures of our patients and make every effort to equip our car egivers with the knowledge and resources to respect each patient's cultural heritage and n eeds. We are mindful that our community is becoming more diverse. Accordingly, we educate our staff to ensure they are equipped to meet our patient's needs in a culturally sensitiv e manner. We develop and implement policies and procedures to protect patient rights in the delivery of patient care. These policies and procedures are located in administrative or patient care manuals which include patient rights, informed consent, advance directives, g rievance management, withholding and withdrawing of life support and pastoral counse l i n g . W e s u p p o r t a n d facilitate patients' rights to access guardianship, advocacy, c onservatorship, child and/or adult protective services by providing information as requested a n d r e f e r r a l s . ( S e e : Abuse/Neglect: Reporting and Identification of Suspected Child Abuse, Elder and/or Dependent Adult Abuse, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pol icy). The Social Work Services Department is responsible for ensuring that the proper protective agencies are notified as required by county, state and federal laws (See: A ttachments). Each patient is provided with a written statement of patient rights and a notic e of privacy practices. These statements conform to all applicable state and federal laws, in cluding but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability act of 1996 (he reinafter referred to as HIPAA).

A full confidentiality statement is received and accepted by each employee as part of the Employee Handbook . We also expect our vendors involved in patient care to perform and provide services consistent with the applicable HIPAA laws. We include HIPAA Bus iness Associate language in our agreements with these vendors. Emergency Treatment We follow the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) in providing an emergency medical screening examination and necessary stabil ization to all patients, regardless of ability to pay. Provided we have the capacity and capability, anyone with an emergency medical condition is treated. In an emergency situati on or if the patient is in labor, we will not delay the medical screening and necessary st abilization treatment in order to seek financial and demographic information. We do not admit, discharge, or transfer a patient with an emergency medical condition simply b ased on their ability or inability to pay or any other discriminatory factor. A patient with an emergency medical condition is only transferre d to another facility at the patient's request or if the patient's medical needs cannot be m et at SHCL and appropriate care is knowingly available at another facility. Patients are on ly transferred in strict compliance with state and federal EMTALA regulatory and statuto ry requirements. Our Responsibilities to and with our Physicians Healthcare services like those owned and operated by SHCL are a c ollaboration between SHCL Staff and SHCL Medical Staff members. As in any collaboration, each party has important roles and responsibilities. SHCL is committed to provid ing an excellent work environment for SHCL Medical Staff. SHCL Staff interacts with SHCL Me dical Staff members in a respectful and supporting way. We require SHCL Medi cal Staff members to be familiar with this Code of Conduct. SHCL Medical Staff are gove rned by Medical Staff Rules and Regulations. a. Interactions with Physicians: Federal and state laws and regulations govern the relationship between hospitals and physicians who may refer patients to SHCL. The applicable feder al laws include the Anti-Kickback Law and the Stark Law. It is important that SHCL S taff who interact with physicians (particularly those SHCL Staff who make payments to ph ysicians for services rendered, provide space or services to physicians, rec ruit physicians to the community, and/or arrange for physicians to serve in leadership positions in the organization) are aware of the requirements of the laws, regula tions, and policies that address relationships between SHCL and physicians. If relationsh ips with physicians are properly structured, but not diligently administered, such failure to administer the arrangements as agreed results in a violation of the law. Any arr angement with a physician must be structured to ensure compliance with legal re quirements. Most arrangements must be in writing and approved by the Compliance Department. Failure to meet all requirements of these laws and regulations can resu lt in serious consequences for SHCL. 07/22/2013 5b. We do not pay for referrals . We accept patient referral and admissions based solely on the p atient's medical needs and our ability to render the needed services. We do not pay or offer to pay anyone - staff, physicians, or other persons or entities - for the referra l of patients. c. We do not accept payments for referrals we make. No SHCL Staff member or any other person acting on behalf of SHCL , is permitted to solicit or receive anything of value, directly or indirectly, i n exchange for the referral of patients. Similarly, when making patient referrals to another h ealthcare provider, we do not take into account the volume or value of referrals that the provider has made to AH. d. We do not Extend Business Cour tesies and/or Tokens of Appreci ation to Potential Referral Sources, Outside of the SHCL Policies . Any entertainment, gift or token of appreciation involving phys icians or other persons who are in a position to refer patients to SHCL must be undertake n in accordance with SHCL policies. These policies were developed to be in complianc e with federal laws, regulations, and rules regarding these practices. SHCL Staff must consult SHCL policies or our Compliance Department prior to extending any bu siness courtesy or token of appreciation to a potential referral source. Our Responsibilities to Ensure Legal and Regulatory Compliance SHCL provides many types of healthcare services. These services are provided pursuant to appropriate federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and federal conditions of participation. Such laws, regulations, and conditions of partic ipation may include, but are not limited to, subjects such as certificates of need, licenses , permits, accreditations, access to treatment, consent to treatment, medical record-keepi ng, access to medical records and confidentiality, patients' rights, clinical researc h, end of life care decision making, and Medicare and Medicaid program requirements. The org anization is subject to other numerous laws in addition to these healthcare laws, regul ations, and the conditions of participation. SHCL has developed policies and procedures to address many legal , accreditation, certification and regulatory requirements. However, it is impra ctical to develop policies and procedures that encompass the full body of applicable law, stand ards, conditions and regulations. Such laws, standards, conditions and regulations no t covered in organizational policies and procedures must still be followed. There is a rang e of expertise within SHCL, including operations counsel and numerous functional experts, w ho should be consulted for advice concerning human resources, legal regulations and st atutes, established standards and applicable conditions of participation. Anyone aware of violations or suspected violations of laws, reg ulations, standards and the conditions of participation, or SHCL policies and procedures must report them immediately. There are many individuals to whom SHCL Staff may v oice such concerns including supervisors, any member of the SHCL Leadership Team, the Vice President of Human Resources, the Compliance Officer, the Compliance Departm ent, the Adventist Health Compliance Officer or Compliance hotline. 07/22/2013 6Accreditation and Surveys From time to time, government agencies and other entities conduct s u r v e y s a t S H C L . Accreditation or external agency surveys are extremely signific ant and broader than the scope of this Code of Conduct. In preparation for, during and after surveys, SHCL Staff must comply with all accrediting and external agency surveyors in a direct, open and honest manner and with accurate information. In preparation for, or during a survey or inspection, SHCL Staff must never conceal, destroy, or alter any documents, lie; or make misleading statem ents to the agency representative. Also, SHCL Staff must never attempt to cause anot her staff member to fail to provide accurate information or obstruct, mislead, or delay the communication of information or records relating to a possible violation of law. No action should ever be taken, directly or indirectly, to mislead the accrediting or ex ternal agency survey teams. Federal and State False Claims Acts Federal and State False Claims Acts prohibit any person or enti ty from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a fals e or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, or knowingly making or using, or causing to made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved. The penalties for violating the Federal or State False Claims A ct include: xCivil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each false claim submitted; xUp to three times the amount of damages the government sustain s because of the false claim; and, xThe costs of the legal action brought to recover for the false claim. A private citizen may file suit under the Federal and State Fal se Claims Acts on behalf of the government if the citizen has direct and independent knowled ge of the submission of a false claim. The government will then decide whether to interve ne and take over the case, dismiss or settle the case, or let the private individual pursu e the case on his or her own. In either case, the person who initially filed the case may receiv e a portion of the amount recovered in either litigation or settlement of the claim. Whistleblower Protections Both the Federal and State False Claims Acts prohibit employers from retaliating or discriminating against an employee who, acting in good faith, i nvestigates, reports or assists in uncovering a false claim or statement. An employee who suffers discrimination or retaliation based on protected activities has the right to sue under the both the Federal and State False Claims Act. If the employee can prove that his or her employer retaliated against him or her fo r engaging in protected activity, the employee is entitled to be \"made whole.\" The reme dies may include: xReinstatement of the employee to his or her position; xTwo times the amount of back pay; xInterest on the back pay; and, 07/22/2013 7xCompensation for any special damages (including litigation cost s and reasonable attorneys' fees). As noted above, it is the policy of Adventist Health and its Af filiates that no employee shall be punished solely on the basis that he or she reported what he or she reasonably believed to be an act of wrongdoing or a violation of the Advent ist Health Corporate Compliance Program. Your local compliance officer can provide more detailed informa tion regarding the protections afforded employees under the Federal and State Fals e Claims Acts. Our Responsibilities in Safegua rding Business and Financial Information Accuracy, Retention, and Disposal of Documents and Records Each SHCL Staff member is responsible for the integrity and accur acy of our organization's documents and records, not only to comply with re gulatory and legal requirements, but also to ensure that records are available to s upport our business practices and actions. No one may alter or falsify information on any record or document. Records must never be destroyed in an effort to deny government al authorities information that may be relevant to a government investigation. Medical and business documents and records are retained in acco rdance with the law and our record retention policy. Medical and business documents inc lude paper documents such as letters and memos, computer-based information such as e -mail or computer files on disk or tape, and any other medium that contains information about the organization or its business activities. It is important to retain and destroy records only according with our policy. SHCL Staff must not tamper with records. No one may remov e or destroy records prior to the specified date without first obtaining permission as outlined in the SHCL records management policy. Coding and Billing for Services We communicate our billing policies to all our patients prior t o, or, at the time of service or admission. We bill our patients for services rendered and provi de itemized bills free of charge upon request. Our patient financial services office respo nds to patient questions in a timely and courteous manner. We perform annual audits to ensu re the accuracy of our bills. We make adjustments to correct any over or under billings . We have implemented policies, procedures and systems to facilita te accurate billing to our government payers, commercial insurance payers, and patients. T hese policies, procedures, and systems conform to pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. We prohibit any SHCL Staff member from knowingly presenting or causin g to be presented claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious, or f raudulent. In support of accurate billing, medical records must provide re liable documentation of the services we provided. It is important that all individuals who contribute to the medical record provide accurate information and do not destroy any info rmation considered part of the official medical record. Accurate and timely documentation also depends on the 07/22/2013 8diligence and attention of physicians who treat patients in our facilities. We expect physicians to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner. Confidential Information: The term \"confidential information\" refers to proprietary infor mation about our organization's strategies and operations as well as patient info rmation and third party information. Improper use or disclosure of confidential informa tion could violate legal and ethical obligations. SHCL Staff may use confidential information only to perform their job responsibilities. We do not share this information with others unless the individuals, entities, and/or contractual business relationships have a legi timate need to know. Consistent with HIPAA, we do not use, disclose or discuss patie nt specific information, including patient financial information, with others unless it is necessary to serve the patient or required by law .Any breach of confidentiality represents a failure to meet the professional and ethical standards expected, and constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct. A full confidentiality statement is received and acce pted by each employee as part of the SHCL Employee Handbook. Cost Reports We are required by federal and state laws and regulations to su bmit certain reports outlining our operating costs and statistics. We comply with fed eral and state laws, regulations, and guidelines relating to all cost reports. These laws, regulations, and guidelines define what costs are allowable and outline the appr opriate methodologies we may use to claim reimbursement for the cost of services provide d. All issues related to the preparation, submission and settlemen t of cost reports must be performed in accordance with the Adventist Health Cost Reportin g Program Policies and Procedures.

This information serves as a basis for managing our business and is important in meeting our obligatio ns to patients, staff, suppliers, and others. It is also necessary for compliance with tax and financial reporting requirements. All financial information must reflect actual transactions and conform to generally-accepted accounting principles. All funds or assets must be properly reco rded. SHCL maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that all transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and are recorded in a proper manner to maintain accountability of the assets. Intellectual Property Rights and Obligations Any work of authorship, inventions, or other creation created b y a staff member during the scope of his or her employment with SHCL shall be considered the property of SHCL, including any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or oth er intellectual property right. Our Responsibilities to Our SHCL Staff Conflict of Interest A conflict of interest may occur if a SHCL Staff's outside activ ities, personal financial interest, or other private interest interfere or appear to inte rfere with his or her ability to make objective decisions in the course of his or her job respon sibilities. Conflicts of interest also arise when a SHCL Staff member or a member of his or her fam ily receives improper benefits as a result of his or her position in SHCL. SHCL Staff ar e obligated to ensure they remain free of conflicts of interest in the performance of thei r responsibilities at SHCL. Clinical decisions are made wit hout regard to c ompensation or p ersonal financial benefit to SHCL leaders, managers, clinical staff, or licensed independent practitioners. You are encouraged to raise any questions involving this policy with th e Vice President for Human Resources or the Compliance Department before becoming engaged in outside activities or relationships that may give rise to an actual or perceived c onflict. If SHCL Staff do become involved in a transaction where personal interests conflict with SHCL's interests, they are required to disclose that conflict to a supervisor, the Human Resources Department or the Compliance Department. SHCL Board m embers, executives, and directors are required to sign a Conflict of Intere st Statement in accordance with the SHCL Conflict of Interest Policy. No waiver of this conflict of interest provision may be granted unless approved in advance by the Compliance Committee. Controlled Substances/ Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace The dangers of drug and/or alcohol abuse are numerous, includin g the risks of loss of life, physical damage to people and property, a decline in morale and productivity, and deterioration in the quality of goods and services produced. Ou r policy is to maintain a 07/22/2013 10drug/alcohol-free workplace. Thus, the unlawful manufacture, di stribution, dispensing, possession or use of a controlled substance or alcohol is prohi bited in our workplace. All SHCL Staff must report for work free of the influence of alcohol and illegal drugs. Any SHCL Staff member who reports to work under the influence of any i llegal drug or alcohol, has an illegal drug in his or her system, or who uses, possesses, or sells illegal drugs while on SHCL work time or property may be terminated immediately. We m ay use drug testing as a means of enforcing this policy. Some of our staff routinely have access to prescription drugs, c ontrolled substances, and other medical supplies. Many of these substances are governed an d monitored by specific regulatory organizations and must be administered by physician order only. Prescription and controlled medications and supplies must be handled properl y and only by authorized individuals to minimize risks to SHCL and to patients. Any SHCL S taff member who becomes aware of inadequate security of drugs or controlled sub stances or the diversion of drugs from the organization must report it immediately. As a condition of continued employment, SHCL Staff are expected an d required to abide by this policy and to notify their department manager of any cr iminal drug/alcohol statute conviction against them no later than 5 calendar days after suc h conviction. A conviction means a finding of guilt, including a plea of nolo contender or imposition of a sentence or both by any judicial body charg ed with the responsibility to de termine violations of the federal or state criminal drug/ alcohol statutes. Diversity and Equal Emp loyment Opportunity SHCL actively promotes diversity in its workforce at all levels of the organization. We are committed to providing an inclusive work environment where ever y o n e i s t r e a t e d w i t h fairness, dignity, and respect. We are accountable to each othe r for the manner in which we treat one another and for the manner in which people around u s are treated. We are committed to recruiting and retaining a diverse staff that is ref lective of the patients and community we serve. We regard laws, regulations and policies re lating to diversity as a minimum standard. We strive to create and maintain a setting in which we celebrate cultural and other differences and consider them strengths. SHCL maintains an equal opportunity workforce and no one shall u nlawfully discriminate against any individual with regard to race, color, religion, gen der, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, g ender identity or veteran stat us with respect to any offer, or term or condition, of employment. We make reasonable accommodat ions to the known physical and mental limitation of qualified individuals with di sabilities. Harassment and Disruptive Behavior SHCL seeks to provide a work environment that is free of all for ms of discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment and disruptive behavior .Prohibited forms of discriminatory harassment include, but are not limited to, oral , physical or visual harassment. SHCL considers unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual f avors, remarks or jokes of a sexual nature, and other verbal or physical conduct o f a sexual nature to constitute sexual harassment when: 07/22/2013 11I. submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or impli citly a term or condition of an individual's employment; II. employment decisions concerning an individual are based on w hether the person submitted to or rejected the harassing action; and/or III. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably inter fering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, host ile or offensive working environment\u2014even where it leads to no tangible or economic job c onsequences. We strongly disapprove of discriminatory harassment in any form . We do not tolerate harassment by anyone based on the cultural backgrounds of those who work with us. Degrading or humiliating jokes, slurs, intimidations, or other harassing conduct is not acceptable in our workplace. Sexual harassment is considered t o be sex discrimination in violation of applicable state and federal law subjecting the ha rassing employee to legal liability. SHCL Staff who observe or experience any form of alleged discrimi nation, discriminatory harassment or violence should be reported to either a department head or the Human Resources department. The law protects SHCL Staff from any retalia tion for reporting or participating in the investigation of discrimination or discrim inatory harassment. A prompt and thorough investigation of the alleged incident will be cond ucted. To the extent possible, the investigation and any subsequent action will proc eed in an atmosphere of confidentiality. We will take all appropriate steps to enforce this policy, including termination or other disciplinary action, against persons who h ave violated this policy. SHCL Staff who have submitted a complaint of discrimination or dis criminatory harassment addressed under this policy should immediately make a further c omplaint if the discrimination or discriminatory harassment resumes. Health and Safety SHCL complies with all workplace health and safety rules and reg ulations. Our policies and practices are designed to protect our staff from potential workplace hazards. SHCL Staff need to be familiar with these policies and how they apply to their specific job responsibilities. Each staff member should seek advice from his or her supervisor, or the hospital's Safety Officer, whenever he/she has a question or co ncern. It is important that each staff member immediately advise a supervisor or the Safety O fficer of any serious workplace injury or any situation presenting a danger of injury . Immediate notification allows for timely corrective actions. Environmental Compliance It is SHCL policy to comply with all environmental laws and regu lations as they relate to SHCL's operations. We act to preserve our natural resources to the full extent reasonably possible. SHCL complies with all environmental laws and operates its facilities with the necessary permits, approvals, and controls. We diligently emplo y the proper procedures to provide a good environment of care and to prevent pollution. In helping SHCL comply with these laws and regulations, all SHCL Staff must understand how job duties may impact the environment. Staff must adhere to all requirements for the proper handling of hazardous material, and immediately alert su pervisors to any situation regarding the discharge of a hazardous substance, improper disp osal of hazardous and medical waste, or any situation that may be potential damaging to the environment. 07/22/2013 12Hiring of Former and Current Gove rnment and Medicare Administra tive Contractor Employees The recruitment and employment of former or current U.S. govern ment employees may be impacted by regulations concerning conflicts of interest. Hirin g employees directly from a Medicare Administrative Contractor requires certain regulatory notifications. Staff should consult with the Human Resources Department or the Compliance D epartment regarding such recruitment and hiring. Ineligible Persons We do not contract with, employ, or bill for services rendered by any individual or entity: (1) that is excluded or ineligible to participate in federal hea lthcare programs; (2) that was suspended or debarred from federal government contracts and not reinstated in a federal healthcare program after a period of exclusion, suspension, deba rment, or ineligibility; or (3) has been convicted of a criminal offense that falls within the scope of 42 U.S.C. 1320a- 7(a), but has not yet been excluded, debarred, suspended or oth erwise declared ineligible (each, an \"Ineligible Person\"). Upon hire we search the Departmen t of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General, Exclusive Parties List Sy stem (EPLS) and General Services Administration's lists for such Ineligible Persons. All SHCL Staff must disclose to SHCL any debarment, exclusion, su spension or other event that makes that person an Ineligible Person within twenty -four (24) hours of becoming aware of such event. SHCL will remove known Ineligible Persons from responsibility for, or involvement with, SHCL's business operat ions related to Federal health care programs and will remove them from any position for which their compensation or the items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed by s uch individual are paid by a Federal health care program or with Federal funds at least unti l such time as such individual is reinstated into participation in the Federal heal th care programs. If SHCL has actual notice that a SHCL Staff is charged with a cri minal offense that falls within the scope of 42 USC \u00a7 1320a-7(a), (b)(1)-(3), or if prop osed for exclusion during such individual's employment or contract term SHCL will take all appropriate actions to ensure that the responsibilities of such individual have not an d shall not adversely affect the quality of care rendered to any patient or any claims submi tted to a Federal health care program. Insider Information/Confidential Information In the course of employment with St. Helena Hospital Clear Lake , SHCL Staff may become aware of non-public information about SHCL that is material to t he SHCL's business strategy and operations. Non-public, material information may i nclude, among other things, plans for mergers, marketing strategy, financial results, or oth er business dealings. SHCL Staff may not discuss this type of information with anyone outsi de the organization. Within the organization, SHCL Staff should discuss this information on a strictly \"need-to-know\" basis and only with other SHCL Staff who require this informatio n to perform their jobs. License and Certification Renewals SHCL Staff, individuals retained as independent contractors, an d privileged practitioners in positions which require professional licenses, certification s, or other credentials are 07/22/2013 13responsible for maintaining current credentials and shall comply at all times with federal and state requirements applicable to their respective disciplin es. SHCL does not allow any SHCL Staff member, independent contractor or privileged practitioner to work without a valid, current license or creden tial. Each SHCL Staff member must have evidence of current and valid license, certification, registration, accreditation or credential as required by their position description. Copyright and Intellectual Property SHCL respects the ownership rights of those creating physical, di gital, and intellectual property. Copyright infringement is using copyrighted property without the owner's permission. This unauthorized use is also called piracy. Exam ples could include using unlicensed software, distributing many copies of non-public boo ks or articles, and using business models (intellectual property) without consent or cred it. SHCL Staff will not utilize copyrighted physical, digital, and intellectual property withou t the prior written permission of the owner. Personal Use of SHCL Resources Credit cards, desks, and other items provided by SHCL continue t o remain organizational property, must be maintained in accordance with SHCL's policies, and used only for business purposes. SHCL reserves the right to monitor and inspec t all organizational property, without notice, and without the SHCL Staff member presen t. SHCL may monitor and inspect organizational property even if a password or perso nal code has been assigned. Prior authorization must be obtained before the remov al of any organizational property from the premises. All organizational property must be returned immediately upon request or termination in the same condition as when originally provided. Personal items brought onto the organization's property also are subject to in spection, without notice, and without the SHCL Staff member present. Relationships a mong SHCL Staff In the normal day-to-day functions of an organization like SHCL , there are issues that arise from how people in the organization relate to one another. It is impossible to foresee all of these issues, and many do not require explicit treatment in this Code of Conduct. While we wish to avoid any strict rules, no one should ever feel compell ed to give a gift to anyone for a birthday, holiday or other celebration, and any gifts offered or received should be appropriate to the circumstances. A lavish gift to anyone in a supervisory role would clearly violate organization policy. Similarly, If SHCL agrees to suppor t a charitable organization, no SHCL Staff member should feel compelled to contribute to the ch aritable organization, nor should there be any workplac e consequences of such non-parti cipation. For reasons of supervision, safety, security and morale, family members will not be employed under the direct supervision of one another nor will th ey be placed in the same department, division or facility if the work involves potential conflicts of interest. For these reasons, as well to avoid misunderstandings, complaints of favo ritism or possible claims of sex discrimination or sexual harassment, managers and superviso rs are prohibited from establishing, maintaining, or attempting to establish or mainta i n a r o m a n t i c o r s e x u a l relationship with any subordinate employee within their chain o f command. The term \"family members\" includes a SHCL Staff member's parents, children (na tural, adopted or 07/22/2013 14under legal guardianship), spouse, brothers, sisters, grandpare nts, grandchildren, cousins, aunts, uncles, in-laws and step-relationships with all the prec eding relationships. An exception to this policy is allowed only with the approval of t he Vice President of Human Resources. If co-employees become related, or if a supervisor and a subord inate attempt to or establish or maintain a romantic or sexual relationship, it shou ld be reported promptly to the immediate supervisor of the manager or supervisor who is rel ated or involved in the relationship. If co-employees become related, we will make reas onable efforts to assign job duties so as to minimize problems of supervision, safety, s ecurity or morale. Relationships with Subc ontractors and Suppliers SHCL has a Code of Conduct and Business Relationship Statement t hat outlines its commitment to ethical and compliant behavior and its expectatio ns of the same by its contractors. We treat our vendors fairly and maintain impartiali ty in our relationships. We do not allow our friendships with our vendors or others with wh om we may do business in the future to affect our business decisions. Charitable gifts or contributions from vendors are not required , and have no bearing upon their actual or potential business relationship with us. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, subsidies to underwrite the costs of medical e ducation or professional meetings are permitted, in that they benefit patient care and c ommunity health. SHCL Staff must manage consulting, subcontractor, and supplier r elationships in a fair and reasonable manner, free from conflicts of interest and consiste nt with all applicable laws. SHCL promotes competitive procurement to the maximum extent pract icable. SHCL's selection of consultants, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendor s will be made on the basis of objective criteria including quality, technical excellence, price, delivery, adherence to schedules, service, and maintenance of adequate sources of supp ly. Our purchasing decisions will be made on the supplier's ability to meet our ne eds, and not on personal relationships and friendships. SHCL employs the highest ethical s tandards in business practices in source selection, negotiation, determination of co n t r a c t a w a r d s , a n d t h e administration of all purchasing activities. SHCL complies with contractual obligations not to disclose vendor confidential information unless permitted un der the contract or otherwise authorized by the vendor. It is critical to avoid the appearance of impropriety when givi ng gifts to individuals who do business or are seeking to do business with SHCL. SHCL will never u s e g i f t s o r o t h e r incentives to improperly influence relationships or business ou tcomes. Our Responsibilities while Developing Business and Marketing Se rvices SHCL operates in a highly competitive environment. SHCL's busines s development and marketing activities must conform to the highest standards of inte grity and fairness reflected in this Code of Conduct. SHCL requires compliance with an titrust and other laws governing competitive activities. 07/22/2013 15Antitrust and Unfair Competition SHCL restricts communication with competitors. Generally, SHCL Staf f are not to discuss with competitors non-public \"competitively sensitive topics.\" B ecause the antitrust laws are so complex and their application can depend upon the conditions in local markets, it is not practical to adopt written polices to govern all situations. SHC L Staff should consult with their supervisors or the Compliance Department for guidance conce rning competitive activities, laws and polices relating to their areas of respons ibility. Marketing and Advertising Consistent with laws and regulations that governs such activities , SHCL uses marketing and advertising to educate the public, provide information to t he community, increase awareness of services provided by SHCL, and for recruitment pur poses. SHCL strives to present only truthful, fully informative, and non-deceptive inf ormation in these materials and announcements. SHCL will not distort the truth about service s or products provided by the hospital, nor will we attack or disparage another provider, whether by name or implication, in any marketing or advertising efforts. We may fe ature our outstanding services or offer factual evidence of quality of care, but will not claim superiority where it cannot be substantiated. Our Responsibilities in our Relat ionships with other Companies This part of the Code of Conduct should not be considered in an y way as an encouragement to make, solicit, or receive any type of entrainm ent or gift. Receiving Business Courtesies We do not expect any gifts from our vendors beyond good service . However, SHCL recognizes that there will be times when a current or potential business associate, including a potential referral source, extends an invitation to a SHCL Staff member to attend a social event, in order to further develop or provide appr eciation of a current business relationship. All gifts, entertainment and business m eals provided or received must be reasonable and small enough that they do not influence o ur decisions. We never offer or accept anything of value in exchange for referrals or other business. We let our vendors, physicians, customers and others know that our core va lues limit what we can receive or give. We want our services and business relationship s to stand on their own. What is a gift? It is anything of value - including traditional ma rketing items like t-shirts or logoed items - if the recipient receives it for free. We should r ecognize there is a difference between a simple pen and an expensive electronic device from a vendor. What constitutes entertainment? This includes an invitation to eve nts, sports activities or games or concerts where the recipient is not expected to pay fo r a ticket or participation fee. We should recognize there is a difference between attendin g a community-supported or non-profit gala and front-row seats at an expensive event. What constitutes a business meal? This is any meal where the pri mary purpose of the meeting is to discuss SHCL business or quality initiatives. 07/22/2013 16If you question a gift or participation in an entertainment even t, contact the Compliance Department. Extending Business Courtesi es to Non-Referral Sources 1. Meals and Entertainment. - There may be times when a SHCL Staff member wishes to extend to a current or potential business associate (o ther than someone who may be in a position to make a patient referral) an invitatio n to attend a social event (e.g., reception, meal, sporting event) to further or dev elop a business relationship. The purpose of the entertainment must never be to induce any favorable business action. During these events, topics of a bus iness nature must be discussed and the host must be present. 2. Sponsoring Business Events - SHCL sponsors events for legitimate b usiness purposes (e.g., hospital board meetings or retreats). These even ts may include SHCL paid meals, entertainment, transportation and lodging. Howe ver, all elements of these events, including these courtesy elements, must be cons istent with the corporate policy on business events. 3. Gifts - It is critical to avoid the appearance of impropriety when giving gifts to individuals who do business or are seeking to do business with SHCL. We will never use gifts or other incentives to improperly influence relat ionships or business outcomes. In order to avoid embarrassment, an effort should be made to ensure that any gift we extend meets the business conduct standards of the recipient's organization. U.S. federal and state governments have strict rule s and laws regarding gifts, means and other business courtesies for their employees. SHCL does not provide any gifts, entertainment or anything else of v alue to any employee of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government or its fiscal intermediaries, except for minor refreshments in connection with business discu ssion. Our Responsibilities in our Relat ionships with Government Agenc ies and Officials SHCL and its representatives comply with all federal, state, and l o c a l l a w s g o v e r n i n g participation in government relations and political activities. As a general policy, SHCL funds or resources will not contribute directly to individual pol itical campaigns, political parties or other organizations that intend to use the funds prim arily for political campaign objectives. At times, SHCL may ask SHCL Staff to make personal contact with g overnment officials or to write letters to present our positions on specific issues. In addition, it is part of the role of some SHCL management to interface on a regular basis with govern ment officials. If a SHCL Staff member is making these communications on behalf of the organization, he/she must be certain to be familiar with any regulatory constraints and observe them. At no time may SHCL Staff speak on behalf of SHCL without first being given consent by the CEO or his/her designee. Avenues of communication may include tradition al ways such as telephone and letters along with newer ways such as social medi a. Guidance is always available from the Compliance Department as necessary. 07/22/2013 17How We Ensure Compliance with our Code of Conduct Program Structure The Compliance Program is intended to demonstrate in the cleare st possible terms our absolute commitment to the highest standards of conduct, ethics , and compliance. The elements of the program include setting standards, communicating those standards, providing mechanisms for reporting concerns, monitoring and audi ting, program effectiveness, and maintaining an organizational structure that continues to support the Compliance Program. These elements are supported at all levels of SHCL. The Corporate Compliance Committee is responsible for providing direction, gui dance and oversight to senior leadership and the Local Compliance Committee. The SHCL Compliance Officer and the Compliance Department are re sponsible for the day-to-day direction, coordination and any applicable revisions or updates of the Code of Conduct and the Compliance Program. This includes developing reso urces (including policies and procedures, training programs, and communication to ols), distributing standards, providing support (including operating the Complianc e hotline, conducting program assessment, and providing advice), ensuring compliance w ith training requirements and otherwise administering the program. In support of the SHCL Compliance Officer, SHCL Senior Leaders hav e expertise in various areas of compliance and are called upon to lead policy a nd training development efforts, conduct monitoring and auditing as appropriate, and pr ovide advice. Additionally, the Vice President of Human Resources, the hospital Risk Manage r, and the Accreditation Coordinator are all important resources that may be accessed to address issues arising out of this Code of Conduct. SHCL's Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring the functi oning of the Local Compliance Committee. Setting Standards SHCL sets standards through this Code of Conduct, along with our a ssociated policies and procedures and the annual or periodic (for applicable positions) compliance program training. It is the responsibility of each individual to be aware of these policies and procedures, how they pertain to his or her work, and to follow t hese policies and procedures. Training and Communication Comprehensive training and education has been developed to ensu re that SHCL Staff are aware of the standards that apply to them. Code of Conduct train ing is conducted at the time an individual joins SHCL and annually for all SHCL Staff. Com pliance training in areas of compliance risk (e.g., billing, coding, cost reports) is req uired of certain individuals. SHCL and Adventist Health policies outline the training requirem ents. For SHCL employees, all training is recorded within our complian ce education system. System administrators and the Compliance Officer can track emplo yee compliance with their training requirements and report such information as nece ssary. Non-employees will receive training as required by applicable requirements or regu lations. 07/22/2013 18Personal Obligation to Report SHCL is committed to ethical and legal conduct that is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations, and to correct wrongdoing wherever it may occur at SHCL. Each SHCL Staff has an individual responsibility to report any activity by any staff, physician, subcontractor, or vendor that appears to violate applicable law, rules, regula tions, accreditation standards, standards of medical practice, federal healthcare co nditions of participation, or this Code of Conduct. If any SHCL Staff member or Board member has concerns, we encoura ge you to report it through one of our reporting compliance program options identif ied below so that we may investigate and resolve the issue. However, if you believe we ha v e l e f t a n i s s u e unresolved, the matter can be reported to other entities such as Adventist Health, the Medical Board of California, The Joint Commission, and the Depa rtment of Public Health. There will be no retaliatory disciplinary action taken against any individual who reports concerns to any of these entities. Resources for Guidance and Reporting Concerns To obtain guidance on an ethics or compliance issue or to repor t a concern, individuals may choose from several options. We encourage the resolution of your concerns, at a local level. You may report issues to your immediate supervisor o r any member of the Leadership Team. Your other reporting options include: xCorporate Compliance Hotline (888) 366-3833 xLocal Compliance Officer (707) 963-6260 xHuman Resources Department (707) 995-5845 xPatient Privacy and Security (707) 995-5712 xPatient Financial Services (855) 551-8701 Our policies and procedures can be accessed through our Intranet. SHCL makes every effort to maintain, within the limits of the la w, the confidentiality of the identity of any individuals who report concerns or possible misc onduct. SHCL does not retaliate or discipline anyone for reporting a concern in good f aith. Any staff member who deliberately makes a false accusation with the purpose of harmi ng or retaliating against another staff member is subject to discipline. Internal Investigations of Reports We are committed to investigating all reported concerns promptl y and confidentially to the extent possible. The Compliance Officer coordinates any finding s from investigations and immediately recommends corrective actions or changes that need t o be made. We expect all staff to cooperate with investigation efforts. Corrective Action Where an internal investigation substantiates a reported violat ion, it is SHCL's policy to initiate a corrective action, including, as appropriate, making prompt restitution of any overpayment amounts, notifying the appropriate governmental age ncy, instituting whatever 07/22/2013 19disciplinary action is necessary, and implementing systemic cha nges to prevent a similar violation from recurring in the future. Discipline All violators of the Code of Co nduct will be subject to disciplin ary action in accordance with the SHCL Employee Handbook. by SHCL management. SHCL contractors and sub-contractors are subject to possible con tract termination. Measuring Program Effectiveness We are committed to assessing the effectiveness of our Complian ce Program through various efforts. Much of this effort is provided by the Adventis t Health Corporate Compliance Department, which routinely conducts audits of issues that have regulatory or compliance implications. Responsible executives routinely under take monitoring efforts in support of policies and compliance in their areas of responsibi lity. Review: This Code of Conduct is reviewed at least every two years and re vised as necessary in response to issues which arise in the health-care industry, cha nges in accreditation, legal and/or regulatory requirements, and recommendations, which may arise from resolution of ethical issues.

During their first phone call they discussed what she wanted to work on regarding her health and fitness, set goals, and planned how she could achieve those goals. \"My health coach has been very encouraging and has given me great tips both by phone and email. I think that having a health coach is a great benefit provided by Adventist Health. It helps to have someone objective to talk with about my personal goals. It gives me an opportunity to step back and assess what I am doing, so that I can achieve better health.\" Lori has continued to check in with her health coach every few weeks regarding her progress toward her health goals.

SUPPORT, STRENGTH AND SUCCESS: LOSING 226.4 POUNDS WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS \"I started working on my weight in 2013 by joining Weight Watchers, which I am still active in. By February of 2014 I had lost 100 lbs. all from just eating better. At that time I was unable to exercise from the severe back pain I had, and I could barely walk or stand for five minutes at a time. From 2014 to 2015 I had stopped losing weight \u2014 I had plateaued, and whether I gained or lost weight, I was always within a couple pounds of the 100 I had lost. In May of 2015 I needed emergency back surgery and it was a complete success, even if I didn't think so at the time. After the surgery, I became depressed. I turned back to food for comfort and ended up gaining 60 lbs. back of what I had lost. In January of 2016 I started to focus on what was positive in my life and then on my weight. I started going to Weight Watchers meetings again and walking. It was in July of 2016 that I started going to the gym and exercising, and I still am going to the gym faithfully each week. Exercise was what was missing from my life, it is exactly what I needed. I currently weigh 221.2 pounds. Eating better, exercising, going to Weight Watchers and having the love and support of family, friends, co-workers and the community has been amazing and so very helpful.\"Matthew Hartke EMR coordinator, Home Health & Hospice Adventist Health Home Health & Hospice Services Mendocino CountyLivingWell: Adventist Health's whole-person health and wellness program LivingWell is offered to all employees and is required for all Engaged!

Adventist Health's LivingWell program has encouraged this already-fit pair to develop an even healthier lifestyle. You might think marathon runners couldn't possibly have much room to improve, but each of them credits the LivingWell program for important health outcomes. Vicki began running in 1987 with her husband. They were inspired by watching the Portland Marathon and wanted to do it for themselves. Starting with just one-mile runs, they worked their way up to full marathons. Vicki's husband, Gary, completed 72 marathons before he passed away in 2012. His goal was to run 100 marathons, which Vicki and Emillie have decided to complete in his memory. For Emillie, running marathons was something she picked up after her parents had started. She was overweight and decided she wanted to take control of her life. Vicki trained with her daughter and walked and ran with her during her first marathon. Training for marathons takes a lot of time, discipline and dedication. For Vicki and Emillie it's something they share. Through their weekly long runs they spend time talking and even in prayer. With the ultimate goal in sight, Vicki and Emillie have completed a marathon every two weeks since March 2017. Vicki completed her 100th marathon on July 15. INSPIRED BY LIVINGWELL \"Being part of an organization that emphasizes wellness means so much to me,\" says Vicki. \"The LivingWell program has helped me improve my health by changing how I eat. Because of classes and challenges that have been offered at work I've moved to a diet with more whole, plant-based foods. I used to be on medication for my blood pressure, but by eating differently I no longer need it.\" Emillie's experience is similar. \"It's a lot of small things,\" she says. \"From signs encouraging us to take the stairs, and information about walking routes on campus, there's a culture of being active. The LivingWell challenges give us the opportunity to explore new and different aspects of our health. A fruit and veggie challenge helped me jump start improvements in the way I was eating. That's helped me lower my cholesterol by 22 points.\" Vicki Classen, telephone operator at Adventist Health Portland, and her daughter, Emillie Niblack, customer care associate, are grateful for their health and fitness achievements. 11\"In January I was in a really bad place when it came to taking care of myself. In April 2017 I decided to go to the TakeTEN program in St. Helena. Three months later I am completely transformed, inside and out. I have lost 21 pounds and have re-prioritized both my physical and mental health. Looking back at pictures I can see now what I couldn't see then. It hasn't always been easy, but I know that I'm worth it. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm well on my way, and I know I won't ever go back. TakeTEN was a life-changing experience for me, and I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to go. Take care of yourself. Prioritize yourself. Believe in yourself. Love yourself.\" \u2014Jennifer Cowan, Engaged! Premier Program member 12Why do I have to complete LivingWell points if I am already healthy? LivingWell is a lifestyle.

A group of employees at Millsbridge Family Care, Adventist Health Lodi Memorial, decided it was time for a Biggest Loser Challenge. The eight-week challenge encouraged them to get into shape, eat healthier, and win a prize. Throughout the eight weeks, they motivated each other by holding everyone accountable to sticking to their weight loss strategies. Losing weight is not an easy task; however, a supportive environment greatly aids in achieving one's health goals. \"My strategies that drove success were working out just about every day, paying attention to what I was eating, and practicing portion control.\" After eight weeks she was able to drop 11.6 pounds. \"I learned that portion control was the key to success. I have always been very active with sports and exercise but lacked a true control over my eating habits. I'm now eating breakfast every day which works to shape the rest of my meals for the day.\" As a group, the Biggest Loser Challenge participants lost nearly 60 pounds.

AH facilities : no deductible. AH providers : $200/enrollee. Non-AH PPO providers : $400/enrollee. Copayments don't count toward deductible . Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. Each enrollee must meet their own individual deductible and a separate deductible applies to each enrollee. Are there services covered before you meet your deductible ? Yes. Preventive care , primary care services, and certain other services are covered before you meet your deductible . This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met the deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a list of covered preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive -care-benefits/ . Are there other deductibles for specific services? No. You don't have to meet deductibles for specific service s. What is the out-of- pocket limit for this plan? Individual: $5, 200 ($1, 500 for medical benefits and $ 3,700 for pharmacy benefits).

If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out- of-pocket limits until the overall family out -of-pocket limit has been met. What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit? Your required premiums *, balance- billing charges, and health care this plan doesn't cover. Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out -of- pocket limit . Will you pay less if you use a networ k Yes. See http://claimscentral.ah.org or You pay the least if you use an AH provider . If covered, y ou pay more if you use a N on-AH PPO provider .

AH providers : $400/enrollee . Non-AH PPO providers : $1,100/enrollee . Copayments don't count toward deductible . Generally, you must pay all of the costs from providers up to the deductible amount before this plan begins to pay. Each enrollee must meet their own individual deductible and a separate deductible applies to each enrollee. Are there services covered before you meet your deductible ? Yes. Preventive care , primary care services , and certain other services are covered before you meet your deductible . This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met the deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible. See a li st of covered preventive services at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive -care-benefits/ . Are there other deductibles for specific services? No. You don't have to meet deductibles for specific services . What is the out-of- pocket limit for this plan? Individual: $ 7,150 ($2,900 for medical benefits and $ 4,250 for pharmacy benefits). Family: $ 14,300 ($ 8,700 for medical benefits, $ 5,600 for pharmacy ). The out-of-pocket limit is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If you have other family members in this plan, they have to meet their own out- of-pocket limits until the overall family out -of-pocket limit has been met. What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit? Your required premiums *, balance- billing charges, and health care this plan doesn't cover. Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out -of- pocket limit . Will you pay less if you use a network provider ? Yes. See http://claimscentral.ah.org or call 1 -800-441-2524 for a list You pay the least if you use an AH provider . If covered, y ou pay more if you use a N on-AH PPO provider .

You have the opportunity to redirect a portion of your wages on a pretax basis for benefits available through the Plan. Health care and dependent care expense reimbursements are administered through separate flexible spending accounts. WHAT IS THE WELFARE PLAN CONTRIBUTION BENEFIT? Your pretax dollars make contribution payments for coverage under your employer's group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plan. You make an election when you are hired and you complete the welfare plan enrollment forms. If you choose not to enroll when you are hired, you may add the benefit on a post - tax basis. The contributions will automatically roll over to pretax withholdings at the beginning of the next Plan Year. Your employer must receive written notification before a new Plan Year if you decide to change your withholdi ng election. When insignificant cost increases occur your employer will automatically change contribution deductions. Welfare plan benefits are payable based on the terms of these plans or policies. Benefit selections are subject to Cafeteria Plan qualifyi ng election change event rules that are similar to those in the table at Appendix A. Please discuss changes with Human Resources to ensure you comply with the IRS Regulations. WHAT IS THE HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT BENEFIT? Eligible health care expenses incurred but not reimbursed under any other health plan can be reimbursed from this account based on your redirection election. WHAT IS THE DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT BENEFIT? Eligible dependent care expenses incurred in order to enable you and your spouse to be employed can be reimbursed from this account based on your redirection election. SALARY REDIRECTION AGREEMENT You may elect to sign an agreement by which you authorize the Company to redirect a portion of your salary and contribute t he amount of that redirection on your behalf (as a before -tax contribution) to the benefit(s) of your choice. 2 WHAT IS THE CURRENT MAXIMUM AMOUNT A PARTICIPANT CAN CONTRIBUTE? The maximum spendable dollars for the Plan Year are $17,000. Welfare Plan contributions are limited to actual charges for coverages elected. The maximum annual Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account election is $2,600. The maximum annual Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account election is $5,000 for single employees and married employees who file joint returns. Married employees filing separate returns are limited to $2,500. MAY ELECTIONS BE CHANGED DURING A PLAN YEAR? The legal requirements of a Cafeteria Plan do not permit salary redirection election changes during a Plan Year unless a qualifying election change event occurs. In that case, you may make a new election due to and consistent with your qualifying event. The table in Appendix A details qualifying election change event scenarios allowed by the IRS. WHO IS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PLAN? Adventist Health is the Administrator of the Plan. Adventist Health has the right to interpret the Plan and to modify elections by employees in accordance with any legal requirements relating to the Plan. If I Need More Information, W hom Should I Contact? If you need more information about the Cafeteria Plan, please call the Flexible Spending Administrator, Benefits Administration at 800- 441-2524. Participating Employers The entities that have elected to participate in the Plan are: Adventist Health Corporate , Portland Adventist Medical Center, Hanford Community Hospital , Reedley Community Hospital , Adventist Health Physicians Network, Castle Medical Center, Feather River Hospital, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Willits Hospital, Lodi Memorial Hospital Association, Inc. , St. Helena Hospital Napa Valley , Adventist Health Clear lake Hospital, Inc. , San Joaquin Community Hospital, Simi Valley Hospital and Health Care Services , Sonora Community Hospital , Adventist Health Medical Center Tehachapi, Northwest Medical Foundation of Tillamook , Ukiah Adventist Hospital , Western Health Resources, and White Memorial Medical Center 3 CAFETERIA PLAN BOOKLET GENERAL INFORMATION AN OVERVIEW Adventist Health (the \"Company\") offers you the opportunity t o choose between cash and the following benefits: Welfare Plan Contribution Benefit Health Care Expense Reimbursement Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Under the welfare plan contribution benefit, the dollar amounts that you elect to redirect from yo ur salary on a pretax basis under this Plan will be used to make contribution payments for coverage periods occurring within the Plan Year under the (i) group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plans. . Your pretax salary reduction amounts will be paid directly to the plan(s) or insurer(s). Benefits will be payable according to the terms of the respective plans or policies. In addition, the two reimbursement account options allow you to pay eligible health care and dependent care expenses with before- tax earnings. All three options reduc e your income taxes below what you would pay if you bought the same coverages on an after -tax basis . When you participate, you agree to redirect part of your paycheck for your welfare plan or reimbursement account contributions before Social Security and federal and state income taxes have been withheld. You pay less in taxes because your taxable income is reduced by the amount of your redirection. After you incur eligible expenses, you request reimbursement from th e appropriate account in tax -free dollars. Note: No actual accounts are established, the Flexible Spending Accounts are merely bookkeeping accounts established to keep track of your contributions. Benefits are paid as needed from the Company's general as sets. Redirection of your wages reduces your salary for Social Security purposes. You may receive a lower Social Security benefit at retirement, death or during disability. This employee booklet and the attached table in Appendix A (collectively the \"booklet\") describe the basic features of the Adventist Health System/West Cafeteria Plan (the \"Plan\" or \"Cafeteria Plan\" ), how it operates and how you can get the maximum advantage from it. The Company has established the Plan pursuant to a P lan Document in to which this booklet has been incorporated. However, if there is a conflict between the official P lan Document and the booklet, the P lan Document will govern. Coverage under the group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plans is discussed in a summar y or an official certificate of coverage you receive from the Administrator of the Plan or insurance carrier. If there is a discrepancy between this booklet and the summary or certificate of coverage you receive from the Administrator of the Plan or insur ance carrier, the summary or certificate of coverage will govern. 4 ELIGIBILITY You are eligible to participate in the Plan if you are a regular full -time, part -time, or per diem employee as those classifications are defined in the applicable Participating Employer's personnel policy and procedure manual. DATE OF PARTICIPATION If you are an eligible employee, you will become a Participant in the Plan on the first day of the pay period following your completion of the necessary enrollment forms. Welfare plans may have different effective dates. Please refer to those Plan Documents. If you become an eligible employee after the Plan Year has begun, you must enroll in the Plan within the first 31 days of becoming an eligible employee. If you do not enroll when you are first eligible, you must wait to enroll in the Plan until the next annual enrollment period unless you experience a qualifying election change event. Welfare plans may allow enrollment throughout the Plan Year. The contributions will not be wit hheld on a pretax basis if the enrollment does not occur within the first 31 days of becoming an eligible employee. The enrollment period will be held annually, at dates set by the Administrator of the Plan, before the beginning of the Plan Year for which elections are being made. If you enroll during the enrollment period, you must wait until the next annual enrollment period to change your elections, except in certain cases where you have a qualifying election change event. The table in Appendix A deta ils qualifying election change event scenarios allowed by the IRS. ENROLLING IN THE PLAN During the annual enrollment period (or during the first 31 days after you become an eligible employee), you need to indicate whether you want to participate in any of the following: Welfare Plan C ontribution Benefit Health Care Expense Reimbursement Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement You may, of course, decline participation if you wish. As an eligible employee, you will have an opportunity to enroll once each year. If you fail to make an election during the annual enrollment period, your elections will remain the same for the following Plan Year for the welfare plan contribution benefit. To continue participating in the reimbursement accounts, you must re -enroll eac h year during the annual enrollment period. CHANGING OR STOPPING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS Your contribution (your election) amount will stay in place for the coverage period, unless you have a qualifying election change event. The change to your Salary Redirect ion Agreement must be requested during the 31- day period immediately after the qualifying change and must be due to and consistent with such change. (Please refer to the CHANGE IN BENEFIT ELECTIONS FORM .) The Administrator of the Plan will review and eit her approve or deny the request for the change in election. If approved, the change will be effective the first pay period AFTER the approval is granted, except in the case of birth, adoption or placement for adoption in which case the change will be effe ctive the date of the event when the enrollment form is received within 30 days of the event. 5 If you take a general leave of absence other than a leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), you may elect to continue participation in the Plan and pay your share of contributions with after-tax dollars while on leave Alternatively, you may prepay the contributions for the expected duration of the leave on a pretax salary reduction basis out of your pre -leave salary. If you elect to prepay your share of the contributions before your leave, you must make a special election to that effect before the first pay period for which the deductions will be made. Dependent care accounts must be terminated or suspended prior to taking a Leave of Absence as expenses for daycare/childcare are not eligible for reimbursement while out on leave. If you elect to terminate coverage during an unpaid Leave of Absence, you must submit a Change in Benefit Elections form (1) before your leave and (2) another form within 31 days after returning to work in order to reinstate participation. Reinstatement will be at the same rates of coverage in effect before the Leave of Absence unless there has been another qualifying election change event. TRANSFERS BETWEEN PARTICIPATING EMPLOYE RS If you transfer from one Participating Employer to another, the health care and dependent care expense reimbursement benefits you elected will transfer with you. You will have to re- enroll for the welfare -plan contribution salary reduction; however, this will not be considered a change in election. Your health plan and AD&D coverage must remain the same as that originally elected with the first employer unless a qualifying election change event occurs as a result of the transfer. In that case, an election change may be made consistent with such qualifying election change event. PLAN YEAR January 1 through December 31. COVERAGE PERIOD Period during Plan Year you are an Eligible Employee and have elected to participate in the Plan. DEBIT CARD The flexi ble spending account offers the Take Care debit card.

Services that do not require verification: -Doctor office co- pays -Prescriptions -ER co -pays Services that do require verification include but are not limited to: -Dental procedures -Glasses & Contacts -Major surgeries -Medical Equipment In the event that an expense is not eligible/overpayment has been made and the card has been used, we will adjust the claim to the correct dollar amount, and suspend the debit card until the balance is repaid. 6 WHEN PARTICIPATION ENDS Your participation ends as of the date one or more of the following occurs: Employment with the Company ends You are no longer eligible to participate (see ELIGIBILITY on page 4 ) When Participant fails to make contributions during an unpaid leave of absence or after termin ation of employment. (Special rules apply to a FMLA.) Date Participant revokes Election to Participate due to and consistent with a qualify election change event For the health and dependent care reimbursement account options, the January 1 following an enrollment period in which you do not elect to contribute to the account(s); however, if you have a balance in your account on the last day of the Plan Year, you may continue to participate through the grace period as applicable. The Plan is terminated IF YOU LEAVE THE COMPANY Upon termination you may stop making contributions and discontinue participation in the Cafeteria Plan. Only eligible expenses incurred before termination may be submitted during the year and until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year. If you return to service during the same Plan Year and elect to participate in the Plan, your former elections will be reinstated after prorating for the period you were not employed by a Participating Employer. If you return to service within 30 days of termination, you are required to resume participation at the same election in effect when you terminated. An alternative for the terminating participant is to continue making after -tax contributions for the Health Care Expense Reimbursement account, incurring eligible expenses for the remainder of the year, and submitting claims (until July 1) for services incurred during the Plan Year. You may continue to submit claims (until July 1) for eligible expenses incurred during the remainder of the year for the balance of your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account without making additional contributions. IF YOU DIE A beneficiary may file claims for eligible expenses incurred while you participated in the Cafeteria Plan (before your death). Your beneficiary must submit such claims by July 1 following the end of the Plan Year in which you were participating. FEDERAL RULES THAT APPLY TO REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTS Reimbursement accounts take advantage of federal laws that allow you to pay eligible health care and dependent care expenses with pretax dollars --that is, with money that has not been taxed. Since reimbursement accounts provide tax advantages, the IRS imposes certain restrictions on their use. The IRS requires that you use the money in your reim bursement accounts for expenses you incur during the Plan Year (or during the grace period if applicable) in which you are participating. The Plan Year ends on December 31; however, you have until July 1 of the 7 following year to request reimbursement for expenses incurred during the year. If you do not claim all of the money in your account by that date, the balance is forfeited. If you enroll in both reimbursement accounts, you may not transfer balances from one account to the other. Your Health Care E xpense Reimbursement Account balance remains totally separate from your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance. Once you enroll, you may not stop your payroll deductions or change the amount you contribute during the year unless you have a qu alifying election change event. You have 31 days from the date of the qualifying election change event to change your election. All election changes that you make are prospectively effective from the date the election change is made except in the case of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, for which election changes made within 30 days are effective the date of the event. This means that if you add a new dependent or spouse for reasons other than birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, only ex penses incurred after the date of the qualifying election change event are reimbursable under the Plan for the new dependent or spouse. For example, if you get married on June 1 and make an election to increase your Health Care Spending Account contributi on on June 15, only expenses incurred by your new spouse (and any other newly acquired dependents as a result of the marriage) on or after June 15 are reimbursable under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any expenses incurred by your spouse (or other newly acquired dependents) before June 15 will not be reimbursed under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT The Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account allows you to set aside pretax dollars, t hrough payroll deductions, to pay for qualifying health care expenses not reimbursed by any other health plan. As you or your spouse and qualifying dependents incur eligible health care expenses, you request reimbursement from your Health Care Expense Rei mbursement Account in tax -free dollars. For purposes of the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, qualifying dependents are defined by IRC \u00a7105(b) . Generally, this includes your legal spouse (as defined under federal law), your child(ren) and any qualifying relatives . Your child(ren) includes your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child or legally adopted child, regardless of such child's tax dependent status, marital status, employment status, student status or residency . Your child(ren) is eligible for coverage under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account until the end of the year in which he or she attains age 26. Other qualifying relatives may also be eligible. (See QUALIFYING RELATIVE section for a list of individuals who may be qualifying dependents.) CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT When you enroll in a Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, you choose how much you want deducted annually from your pay and redirected pretax into the account in your name. Y ou may elect to contribute up to $2, 600 per year to your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. The amount you choose is divided by the number of pay periods in the year and deducted on an equal pretax basis from each of your paychecks throughout the year. If your paycheck is less than the amount elected, you must pay any balance due by the first of the next month. Because of IRS rules, it is important to estimate your annual health care expenses carefully when determining the amount you wish to redi rect into your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Amounts not used for eligible expenses incurred during the coverage period, usually the Plan Year, are forfeited. (See the exception to this rule for QUALIFIED RESERVIST DISTRIBUTIONS, below .) 8 ELIG IBLE EXPENSES Most health care expenses not reimbursed by your or your spouse's medical, dental or vision plans can be reimbursed through your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, provided the service/item is received during the coverage period in which you are participating. (Payment date does NOT determine if or when the Plan may reimburse you for the expense.) You can be reimbursed for medical expenses incurred for you, your spouse or others claimed as dependents on your federal income tax return . IRS Code \u00a7213(d)(1) defines medical care as diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body. An expense which is merely beneficial to the general health of an indivi dual is NOT considered an expense for medical care. Eligible medical expenses include, but are not limited to: Deductibles Co-payments under medical, dental and vision plans Orthodontia-- Refer to flier detailing orthodontia reimbursement (available on Con nect) Mental health services in excess of health plan benefits Charges in excess of established usual and customary amounts, as determined under Company medical and dental plans Otherwise unreimbursed dental services (not cosmetic) Medical equipment Chirop ractic services, if to treat a specific medical condition Physical therapy Prescription drugs (qualifying drug or biological that legally requires physician's prescription Over-the-counter drugs and medicines if prescribed by a physician Smoking cessation programs and prescription drugs Insulin Podiatrist fees Support or corrective devices that are necessary for daily living Acupuncture fees Eye exams, eyeglasses, and contact lenses (not covered by a vision care program) Hearing exams and aids Meals, lodgin g and mileage while away from home for medical treatment (see below on how to file) Fees related to a weight -loss program. Cost of diet foods is not covered. (A copy of the physician prescription must accompany the ledger.) IMPORTANT: Effective January 1, 2011, federal law no longer allows expenses for over -the- counter drugs and medicines to be reimbursed from the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account unless prescribed by a physician. Eligible expenses must be incurred on or after your effective date of participation and must be substantiated by the provider of services. Generally, this means you must provide a third -party 9 receipt that shows: 1. The medical treatment, item or device received; 2. The date the expense was incurred; and 3. The amount of the expense. MEALS, LODGING, AND MILEAGE Expenses for transportation and related travel are reimbursable when you obtain medical care for yourself, your spouse, or a qualifying dependent at a location greater than 100 miles from your employing locati on. The travel expenses must be primarily for and essential to medical care. No significant element of personal pleasure, recreation or vacation may be contained in the travel expenses. (See QUAILIFYING RELATIVE section for a list of individuals who may be qualifying dependents.) You must submit substantiating documentation along with your reimbursement request in order for transportation and related travel to be considered an eligible medical expense. Such documentation must include: A letter from the referring physician indicating the name and location of the referred licensed healthcare facility and the name of the attending physician at that location. Original receipts for lodging, meals, public transportation (plane, train, etc .), and local transpo rtation (rental car, public transit, etc.) and fuel. If you use a vehicle other than a rental car, you must provide a contemporaneous mileage log showing the dates of travel, the travel origination and destination points, and the starting and ending odo meter readings of the vehicle you use. IRS limits the amount of travel costs for medical expense purposes to the following: Meals - only those eaten while en route to and from the medical treatment site Lodging - $50 per person per day Mileage - Rate as published by the Internal Revenue Service Persons covered - patient and one attendant if required for medical reasons Your reimbursement cannot exceed the amount of your annual salary redirection election for the Healthcare Expense Reimbursement Acc ount. EXPENSES NOT ELIGIBLE Examples of health care expenses that are not reimbursable by your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account include but are not limited to: Over -the-counter drugs and medicines that are not prescribed by a physician Health plan contributions Any expense reimbursed by a health, dental or vision plan Cosmetic surgery, unless medically necessary Marriage or family counseling Funeral or burial expenses 10 Household or domestic help, even if advised by your doctor Custodial care Massage therapy for general health Any expense incurred in connection with an illegal operation or treatment Health club fees Cosmetics, toiletries, toothpaste, slippers and other personal care items (e.g. shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, etc.) Medical expenses you itemize or for which you take a tax credit on your federal income tax return HOW YOU ARE REIMBURSED To request reimbursement for an eligible expense, submit electronically via MyFlexOnline, MyFlexM obile application, or a completed Expense Claim Form to Benefits Administration, PO Box 619031, Roseville, CA 95661- 9031. You must furnish documents such as itemized bills/invoices or computer printouts, or health plan Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for all expenses claimed. Payment of covered claims will be made to you by direct deposit or check up to the contribution amount you elected. You will only be reimbursed for eligible health expenses for which you have actually received service. No claims will be paid before the services are provided. Claims will b e processed every Tuesday and Thursday on a weekly basis. Claims must be in the Friday prior. If your claim is denied, you may file an appeal (see APPEAL OF DENIED CLAIMS section below). YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE You will receive periodic statements of your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance during the year. Review these statements carefully to help ensure that you use all of your contributions by year -end. REIMBURSEMENT DEADLINE You have until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year to subm it your reimbursement requests for the current Plan Year. Eligible health expenses include only those amounts for services/items received during the coverage period usually the Plan Year and the grace period discussed below, in which you participate in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any balance remaining after July 1 is forfeited. A \"grace period\" follows the end of the Plan Year for the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account for amounts you have allocated to your account that are unus ed at the end of the Plan Year. These amounts may be used to reimburse eligible health expenses incurred during the grace period. The grace period will begin on the first day of the subsequent Plan Year, January 1, and end on March 15. In order to take advantage of the grace period, you must be participating in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the last day of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates. For example, if the Plan Year ends December 31, 2018 , the grace period begins January 1, 2019 and ends March 15, 2019 . The following additional rules apply to the grace period: Eligible health expenses incurred during the grace period and approved for reimbursement will be paid first from amounts that were remaining at the end of the Plan Year to which the grace 11 period relates and then from any amounts that are available to reimburse expenses incurred during the current Plan Year. Remember, you may not use Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account amounts to reimburse health expenses. QUALIFIED RESERVIST DISTRIBUTION You may be able to receive a taxable distribution of amounts allocated to the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account that are unused in the event you are called to active duty if you meet the following criteria: You are a member of a \"reserve component\" (as defined in section 101 of title 37 of the United States Code), which means a member of the Army National Guard; the Reserve for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force or Coast Guard; Air National Guard of the United States; or the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service; You are called or ordered to active military duty for (i) 180 days or more or (ii) for an indefinite period; You provide a copy of your order or call to active duty; and You are a p articip ant in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the date you are called or ordered to duty. If you believe you are eligible for a Qualified Reservist Distribution, you must contact the Administrator of the Plan to request a distribution request fo rm as soon as possible. A request for a Qualified Reservist Distribution must be made in writing on the form provided by the Administrator of the Plan. You must submit a copy of your order or call to active duty along with your request. Requests for a Qualified Reservist Distribution must be made on or after the date of the order or call to duty but before the last day of the Plan Year (or grace period, if applicable) during which the order or call to duty occurred. You will receive your Qualified Reserv ist Distribution within a reasonable period of time, but no later than sixty (60) days after your request has been received. A Qualified Reservist Distribution will be made based on all salary reduction amounts credited to your Health Care Expense Reimbur sement Account for the applicable Plan Year that have not been applied to provide reimbursements submitted before the Qualified Reservist Distribution request is submitted. Claims incurred and submitted but not yet reimbursed at the time the Qualified Reservist Distribution Request is received will be treated like any other claim submitted for reimbursement under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account . The Administrator of the Plan will determine what this amount is on a uniform basis, consistent w ith applicabl e law and IRS interpretations. Unlike your reimbursements from your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account for eligible health expenses , the amount of your Qualified Reservist Distribution is taxed as income and will be reported as income on your W -2. Qualified Reservist Distributions do not apply to amounts in your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account . 12 DEPENDENT CARE EXPEN SE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT The Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account allows you to set aside pretax dollars , through payroll deductions, to pay for qualifying dependent care expenses. These expenses can include care for your children, disabled spouse or other qualifying dependent as defined in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \u00a7152. (See \"Qualifying Individual\" bel ow.) As you incur eligible dependent care expenses, you request reimbursement in tax -free dollars. NOTE: Dependent care expenses are eligible for reimbursement through your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account if they are necessary to enable you to be gainfully employed (you and your spouse if you are married). If your spouse is not employed, dependent care expenses will not be eligible, unless your spouse is a full -time student or is physically or mentally incapable of self -care. Additionally , if you are divorced or legally separated, you must be the custodial parent and need childcare in order for you to work. The IRS states that you must make the determination as to whether you are gainfully employed or in active search of gainful employment on a daily basis. Payments you make under a caregiver arrangement that requires you to pay for care during short, temporary absences will be qualified employment -related expenses. The IRS has established a period of two consecutive weeks or less as a safe harbor for short, temporary absences. The Administrator of the Plan may determine that longer periods of absence are short, temporary absences based on your facts and circumstances. In no situation will absences of 12 weeks under FMLA be deemed shor t, temporary absences. Part -time employees who are required to pay for care on a periodic basis, such as weekly or monthly, will be able to claim those payments as qualified employment -related expenses. CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSE REIMBURS EMENT ACCOUNT When you enroll in a Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account, you choose how much you want deducted annually from your pay and redirected into the account in your name. You may elect to contribute up to $5,000 per year. (If you are mar ried and filing separately, you may contribute up to $2,500 per year. See \"Limitations on Your Contributions\" below.) The amount you choose will be divided by the number of pay periods in the year and deducted on an equal pretax basis from each of your paychecks throughout the year. If your paycheck is less than the amount elected, you must pay any balance due by the first of the next month. Because of IRS rules, it is important to estimate your annual dependent care expenses carefully when determining the amount you choose to redirect into your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Amounts not used for qualifying dependent care during your coverage period are forfeited. LIMITATIONS ON YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS Your contributions to the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account cannot exceed the lesser of your annual earned income or that of your spouse. If your spouse is a full -time student or incapable of self -care, your spouse's monthly income will be considered to be $250 per month if you have one dependent or $500 per month for two or more dependents. 13 QUALIFYING INDIVIDUAL Must share the same principal place of abode with you for more than half the taxable year . An individual age 12 or under who is your \"qualifying child\" as defined in IRC \u00a7152(c). In general, a \"qualifying child\" is your child (including a brother, sister, step sibling) or a descendant of your child (e.g. a niece, nephew, grandchild) who does not provide over half of his or her own support A spouse who is physically or mentall y incapable of self -care A qualifying relative, as defined in IRC \u00a7 152, without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B), who is physically or mentally incapable of self -care and for whom you provide more than one- half of the individual's suppor t and is not your or another individual's qualifying child for the calendar year QUALIFYING RELATIVE Within the meaning of IRC \u00a7152(d), the following individuals qualify as dependents: 1. Son or daughter, biological or adopted, or stepson or stepdaughter o f the taxpayer, or a descendant of either, or an eligible foster child 2. Brother, sister, stepbrother or stepsister of the taxpayer 3. Father or mother of the taxpayer or an ancestor of either 4. Stepfather or stepmother of the taxpayer 5. A son or daught er of a brother or sister of the taxpayer 6. Brother or sister of the father or mother of the taxpayer 7. Son-in-law, daughter -in-law, father -in-law, mother -in-law, brother -in-law or sister -in-law of the taxpayer 8. Individual (other than a spouse) who, for the taxable year of the taxpayer, has as his principal place of abode during the entire tax year the home of the taxpayer and is a member of the taxpayer's household QUALIFYING DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES Reimbursable dependent care expenses are those servic es received and expenses incurred for the care of a qualifying individual in order for you (and your spouse if you are married) to be employed. WHO may PROVIDE services: A relative may provide dependent care services as long as he or she is not a dependent for whom you claim a deduction. Services may not be provided by: Your spouse or dependent Your spouse's dependent Your child under the age of 19 at the close of the calendar year The parent of your qualifying child; e.g. the noncustodial parent 14 WHERE services may be performed: In your home Outside your home - For the care of your dependent age 12 or under - For a Qualifying Individual who regularly spends at least eight ( 8) hours a day in your home ELIGIBLE EXPENSES include, but are not limited to, char ges from: A licensed child care center A nursery school In-home care for a child/spouse unable to care for him/her self Daytime summer camp (not educational) An adult day care center An adult private sitter, nanny or home care companion EXPENSES NOT ELIGIB LE Examples of dependent care expenses that are not reimbursable by your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account, as defined by the IRS, include, but are not limited to: Nursing home charges Kindergarten fees Schooling fees for children in the first grade and up Tuition Food, clothing, or transportation expenses Overnight camp Payments to a dependent you claim as an exemption for federal income tax purposes Expenses you deduct or for which you take a tax credit on your federal income tax return Presc hool fees when separate from childcare HOW YOU ARE REIMBURSED To request reimbursement from your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account for an eligible expense, submit electronically via MyFlexOnline, MyFlexMobile application, or submit a completed E xpense Claim Form to Benefits Administration, PO Box 619031, Roseville, CA 95661- 9031.

Relation ship, if any, of the service provider to you - If services were performed by one of your children, the age of such child 15 4. Place and date where services were performed - If outside your home, does the dependent receiving such services spend at least eig ht (8) hours per day in your home - If at a Dependent Care Center [as defined in IRC \u00a721(b)(2)] , does the center provide dependent care for more than six (6) individuals on a nonresident basis 5. If you are married, provide a statement as to: - The amount of your spouse's earned income if less than $5,000 per calendar year - If your spouse is not employed, is - Spouse incapable of self -care - Spouse a full -time student attending classes at least five ( 5) months per calendar year Payment of covered claims will be made directly to you by direct deposit or check, up to the annual contribution amount you elected, but not to exceed the amount you have contributed to date. You will only be reimbursed for eligible dependent care expenses that have actually been incurred during your coverage period. No claims will be paid before the services are provided . The date you pay for your dependent care services DOES NOT determine when or if the Plan may reimburse you. If your claim is denied, you may file an appeal (A PPEAL OF DENIED CLAIMS section below). YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE You will receive periodic statements of your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance during the year. Review these statements carefully to help ensure that you use all of your contri butions by year -end. REIMBURSEMENT DEADLINE You have until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year to submit your reimbursement requests for the Plan Year. Eligible dependent care expenses include only those amounts for services received during the coverage period, usually the Plan Year and the grace period discussed below, in which you actively participate in the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any balance remaining after July 1 is forfeited. A \"grace period\" follows the end of the Plan Year for the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account for amounts you have allocated to your account that are unused at the end of the Plan Year. These amounts may be used to reimburse eligible dependent care expenses incurred during the grace period. The grace period will begin on the first day of the subsequent Plan Year, January 1, and end on March 15. In order to take advantage of the grace period, you must be participating in the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the last day of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates. For example, if the Plan Year ends December 31, 2018, the gra ce period begins January 1, 2019 and ends March 15, 2019 . The following additional rules apply to the grace period: Eligible dependent care expenses incurred during the grace period and approved for reimbursement will be paid first from amounts that were remaining at the end of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates and then from any amounts that are available to reimburse 16 expenses incurred during the current Plan Year. Remember, you may not use Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account amounts to reimburse dependent care expenses. AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO SAVE TAXES Using the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account is just one way you can receive a tax break for eligible dependent care expenses. The federal government also allows a tax credit called the household and dependent care credit for eligible dependent care expenses when you file your income tax return. The household and dependent care tax credit is an allowance for a percentage of your annual day care expenses as a credit against your federal income tax liability under the U.S. Tax Code. In determining what the tax credit would be, you may take into account only $2 ,400 of such expenses for one eligible dependent or $4 ,800 for two or more dependents. Depending on your adjusted gross income, the percentage could be as much as 35% of your eligible day care expenses to a maximum credit amount of $1,050 for one dependent or $2,100 for two or more dependents (to a minimum of 20% of eligible day care expenses). The maximum 35% must be reduced by 1% (but not below 20%) for each $2,000 portion (or any fraction of $2,000) of your adjusted gross income over $15,000. Tax credit limits may ch ange in future years. Visit the web site for the Internal Revenue Service at www.irs.gov for updates. You can use both the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account and the federal tax credit, provided you do not claim the same expenses for both. You s hould consult a personal financial or tax advisor to help you decide whether the tax credit or the Dependent Care Spending Account is more favorable for you. Note: The amounts that may be used to calculate the tax credit are reduced dollar for dollar by amounts reimbursed under the Dependent Care Spending Account. See IRS Publication 503 for a complete discussion of the tax credit. 17 APPEAL OF DENIED CLA IMS The following appeal procedures apply only to the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account and Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account . Claims procedures for any of the component benefits you pay for through the Welfare Plan Contribution Benefit will be set forth in the Summary Plan Description for the specific component benefit. If any claim for benefits is wholly or partially denied, you will be given notice in writing within 60 days after receipt of your claim with the following information: Specific reason(s) for denial Reference to Plan provisions on which the denial is based Description of any additional material/information needed from you An explanation that you may request in writing within 60 days after such denial notice that the Administrator of the Plan review your claim If you request an administrative review of your claim, you may review pertinent documents and submit comments in writing within the same 60 -day review period. 18 APPENDIX A EVENT HEALTH FSA DEPENDENT CARE FSA I.

Ensuring pa tient safety requires a \"culture of safety\" where the organization avoids assigning blame to individuals. Creating a \"culture of safety\" begins by building awareness. Mistakes are often the resul t of multiple factors, not simply one individual's misstep. It is the philosophy of this organiza tion that safety is everyone' s responsibility and therefore, must be a collaborative effort. Strong organizational leadership i s vital in developing and mai ntaining a culture of saf ety. Such a culture encourages the internal reporting of medical errors and activel y engages clinicians a nd other staff in the design of remedial steps to preve nt future occurrences of these errors. A second major focus of a strong safety culture is on the preven tion of medical errors through t he prospective analysis and redesign of vulnerable patient care systems. Lastly, healthcare organizati ons must understand the importance of communicating with patients and families when unanticipated out comes occur. Encouraging the reporting of medic al errors is critical to the success of any patient s afety effort. Reporting errors serves to: Hold leaders accountable for performance and patient safety. Provide information that leads to improved patient safety. Accountability is necessary to ensure the provis ion of adequate resources and support and fa cilitates a safety conscious culture that s tarts with senior management and pervades front line care providers. Information related to medical errors will enhance k nowledge ab out the causes of errors and their prevention. The purpose of this policy is to describe the underlying system s and processes utilized in the prevention of event triggers, detection of error precursors, and the correcti on of error causes. DEFINITIONS: Adverse Event - An injury resulting from a med ical intervention, or in other words, is not due to the underlying patient condition. Medical Error - Failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or t he use of a wro ng plan to achieve this aim.Page 1 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/cgi /doc-gw.pl?ref=ahshcl:1646 7Sentinel Event - An unexpected occurrence invol ving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof. Serious injury specifically includes loss of limb or function. The phr ase \"or the risk thereof\" includes any process variation fo r which a recurrence would car ry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. Unanticipated Outcome - A result that differs significa ntly from what was anticipated to be the result of a treatment or procedure. Patient Safety Practice - A type of process or structur e whose application reduces the probability of adverse events resulting from ex posure to the healthcare system across a range of diseases and procedures. AFFECTED DEPARTM ENTS/SERVICES: All Departments POLICY: COMPLIANCE - KEY ELEMENTS: A.PROMOTING A SAFETY -CONSCIOUS CULTURE In order to improve patient safety and reduce errors, an enviro nment shall be created and maintained in which we can learn from failure - a safe, non-punitive environm ent that supports candid discussion of errors, their causes, a nd ways to prevent them. This requires the leadership and commitment of senior executives, medical, nursing, a nd clinical staff to create chan ge within our organization. This requires a \"Culture of Safety\" so that the likelihood of error is minimize d. 1.Framework a. Effective leadership is necess ary to facilitat e significant s afety improvements and promote safety awareness. Senior leadership will be active in leading patient safety improvements. b. This organization advocates a c onceptual framework that suppo rts systemic change. Change will be far more productive in reduci ng medical errors t han will targ eting and punishing individuals. c. Improving patient safety involves the coordinated efforts of multiple members of the health care team. This focus on processes and systems rather t han individuals is a vital and necessary step in the identification and prevention o f medical errors. d. The risks associated with hosp italization are significant and the strategies for improvement in patient care are based on the trusting relations hip established between the patient and caregiver as we ll as the trust and respect deve loped between caregivers and hospital leaders. 2.Culture Change a. Culture is defined by how sta ff works together in ongoing eff orts to provide patient care. Four cultural traits co mmon in the health care industry make reducing or preventing medical errors difficult: 1. Fear: Staff afraid of losing their job 2. Shame: Personal failure and professional pride may lead a sta ff member to feel that a \"good\" physician or nurse does not harm patients 3. Urgency: Staff may take shortc uts and bypass routine systems in an effort to act as quickly as possible.Page 2 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/cgi /doc-gw.pl?ref=ahshcl:1646 74. Arrogance: Labeling rules and regulations as bureaucracy b. To adopt a safety conscious cul ture that is bas ed on a non-pu nitive approach to reporting medical errors, the fi ve elements of human performanc e will be considered in an effort to identify barri ers and dispel myths: 1. All people make errors2. Error-prone situations are predictable, manageable, and preve ntable 3. Individual behavior is strongl y influenced by organizational, programmatic, and management performance 4. High levels of human performanc e can be achieved if right beh aviors are taught, encouraged, and reinforced 5. Undesirable events can be avoi ded by understanding and monito ring precursor conditions and applyi ng lessons learned from past and significant events. c. Leaders are educated regarding error management and committed to the goal of medical error reduction and, wher e possible, elimination. Buil ding a clear leadership consensus for change is a top pri ority and fostering a patient safety climate a prevalent management theme. Hospital lea ders promote patient safety awar eness by: 1. Demonstrating patient safety as a top leadership priority, al locating adequate resources and strategic support, including information systems and data management processes for measurin g, assessing, and improving pa tient safety; providing adequate personnel to participate in patient safety activities 2. Ensuring patient safety is interdisciplinary and coordinated and integrated throughout the organization 3. Promoting a non-punitive culture for sharing information and lessons learned 4. Conducting routine organizati on-wide assessments of the risk of error and adverse events in the care deliv ery process; all appropriate de partments and services will be included in th is assessment 5. Evaluating external best prac tices related to clinical care 6. Analyzing adverse events and var iations in performance or pro cesses that affect patient safety and id entifying trends across events 7. Providing recognition for re porting errors and safety-driven decision making 8. Considering information related to patient safety and unantic ipated outcomes in process planning for performance improvement priorities incl uding the design or redesign of proces ses, functions or services 9. Implementing care delivery process improvements which include minimal steps and handoffs, thereby avoiding reliance on memory 10. Engaging patients and families in providing feedback related to safety concerns including the patient's role in helping to facilitate the safe delivery of care and the patient's /family's responsibilit y for reporting pe rceived risk to their care. 11. Measuring the effectiveness o f leadership's contributions to improving patient safetyPage 3 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/cgi /doc-gw.pl?ref=ahshcl:1646 7B.ERROR MANAGEMEN T 1.Vulnerable Patient Care Areas, Systems, and Safety Practices Ongoing monitoring rel ated to patien t safety processes will inc lude the following high-risk areas/systems/practices: a. Physical hospital environment b. Medical Equipment c. Patient care areas d. Infection control practicese. Medication practices f. Surgery g. Anesthesiah. Transfusion practices i. Staffing coverage and competency related to patient safety 2.Approach to Medical Error Management Addressing medical errors in volves the following steps: a. Prevention of event triggers 1. The goal of medical error m anagement is to eliminate, substan tially reduce, or prevent future occurrence of medical errors 2. Education of staff at all leve ls related to error prevention techniques is essential 3. Establishing an accountabilit y system will instill behavior c onsistent with goal of medical error management b.Detection of error precursors 1. Hospital leader s will oversee activities related to performan ce trending, performance monitoring, and actio ns taken to change performance 2. The information cont ained in Sentinel Ev ent Alerts will be wi dely communicated and discussed with consideration given to implemen tation of recommendations contained in Sent inel Event Alerts; when recomm endations are not implemented, justificat ion for so doing will be documen ted. 3. Prospective analysis and redes ign of vulnerable patient care systems will occur as appropriate; a proactive risk assessment of one high-r isk patient safety process w ill be done annually 4. Prompt reporting of medical errors will be enc ouraged; a medi cal error reporting system will be utilized a s the mechanis m for communic ation and reporting of events; this include s \"no harm\" occu rrences as wel l as unanticipated outcomes and sentinel events. 5. Immediate response to a medic al error will include care of th e affected person (s), containment of r isk to others, and pr eservation of factual information for subsequent analys is; support will be prov ided to staff members.Page 4 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/cgi /doc-gw.pl?ref=ahshcl:1646 76. Sentinel events w ill be managed according to hospital policy c. Correction of error will involv e utilizing root cause analysi s or focused reviews to determine human, organizational, and system failures and identi fy management issues 1. Measurement and analysis of critical steps in at least one ac tual process identified as error-prone high-r isk will be done to determine t he degree of variation from intended performance d. Disclosure of Unant icipated Outco mes will be mana ged per Disc losure of Adverse Events and Unanticipated Outco mes Policy. Because of the need to consider the effect the medical error has on the patient's medical condition , further treatment, and current hospitalization, the attending physician, or consulting physician in certain situations, is the most appropri ate responsible party for discu ssing unanticipated outcomes with the patient, family or legally autho rized represe ntative. Even in situations in which a hospital employee has committed the error , the physician is better suited to respond to questions from the patient and family. Ho spital leaders will monitor all Unanticipated Outcom es to ensure appropriate commun ication with patient and family. C.COMMUNICATION / REPORTING OF PATIENT SAFETY ACTIVITIES 1. Hospital leadership will oversee patient s afety activities. Other leadership may include medical staff, hospital Safety Officer, R isk Manager, Quality Director, Pharmacy Director, and Infection Preventionist as appropriate. O ther managers may be included w hen appropriate. 2. Patient safety activities and o utcomes will be r eported to th e PI / Safety Committee, Medical Executive Committee and Governing Board.

Reach for the highest standards in my work.3. Be honest in all things. 4. Provide services that my customers say are excellent. 5. Use all resources responsibly and efficiently. 6. Treat others with the same compassion and respect I would wan t m y f a m i l y t o experience. Our Responsibilities as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Fina ncial Officer and Se nior Leaders: HMH Senior Leadership is responsible for maintaining a culture t hat supports this Code of Conduct. Additionally, all provisions of this Code of Conduct and particularly those provisions relating to ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, compliance with law, and internal reporting of violations of the Code, bind the CEO and Senior Fi nancial Officer. The CEO and Senior Financial Officer also have the responsibility for f ull, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the periodic reports and submissio ns filed by HMH with the designated Medicare Administrative Contractor for California, C enters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), various Federal and State agencies, th e Internal Revenue Service, the Office of Statewide Planning Health and Developmen t (OSHPD), and the Joint Commission as well as in other public communications made by th e organization.

Our Responsibilities as Leaders: While all HMH Staff is obligated to follow our Code of Conduct, we expect our leaders to set an example and be role models.

Leaders must help to support a cultur e within HMH that promotes the highest standards of conduct, ethics and complianc e. This culture must encourage everyone in the organization to share concerns immedi ately. We must never sacrifice ethical and compliant behavior in the pursuit of busi ness objectives. 07/22/2013 2Our Responsibility to Our Patients Quality of Care and Patient Safety We are committed to the delivery of safe, effective, efficient, compassionate and satisfying patient care. We treat all patients with warmth, respect and di gnity and provide care that is both necessary and appropriate. We ensure that the HMH Staff pro vide appropriate, quality patient care by: xIndividualizing care for each patient with care plans that docu ment the reason(s) for the level of care, goals and objectives, interventions and part icipation by appropriate professionals, and which are reviewed and revised a ccording to each patient's needs. Clinical decision making is never based on fin ancial class of patients, ability to pay, or referrals. xEnsuring we never discontinue necessary patient treatment, or p rovide unnecessary patient care for financial reasons. xUsing adequate numbers of appropriately trained staff to implem ent each patient's care plan. xEstablishing a system that incorporates the use of best practic es or established standards. HMH uses generally accepted indicators that help us t o measure the quality of care provided. Agencies that have developed these in dicators include, for example, the Conditions of Participation of the Centers for Med icare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the standards and surveys of The Joint Comm ission. xSupporting our Medical Staff in monitoring quality, utilization of resources and the appropriateness of care plans. xProviding HMH Staff with adequate resources to do their work. xEvaluating technological advancements occurring in the marketpl ace and allocating resources for the purchase of appropriate medical and other rel ated equipment to ensure quality and patient safety and to create an overall cult ure that makes patient safety paramount. xSustaining a culture that encourages questions about whether th e quality or patient safety commitments set forth in this Code of Conduct are being fully met and that requires individuals to raise concerns through appropriate chan nels until a concern or question has been addressed and resolved. Additionally, pati ents, HMH Staff and physicians with a concern about the safety and quality of c are provided at HMH may report these concerns to The Joint Commission or the HMH Pat ient Safety Hotline as follows: Frank R.

Howard Memorial HospitalOne Madrone CA 95490The Joint Commission 1. Telephone: 800-994-66102. In writing: Office of Quality Monitoring The Joint Commission One Renaissance Blvd. Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181 07/22/2013 3 This commitment to quality and patient safety is an obligation of every HMH Staff member. Patient Rights We ensure appropriate care for all patients. We make no distinc tion in the availability of services; the admission, transfer or discharge of a patient; or in the care we provide based on age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, race, color, re ligion, national origin, and ability to pay or type of insurance. We recognize and respect t he diverse backgrounds and cultures of our patients and make every effort to equip our car egivers with the knowledge and resources to respect each patient's cultural heritage and n eeds. We are mindful that our community is becoming more diverse. Accordingly, we educate our staff to ensure they are equipped to meet our patient's needs in a culturally sensitiv e manner. We develop and implement policies and procedures to protect patient rights in the delivery of patient care. These policies and procedures are located in administrative or patient care manuals which include patient rights, informed consent, advance directives, g rievance management, withholding and withdrawing of life support and pastoral counse ling. We support and facilitate patients' rights to access guardianship, advocacy, c onservatorship, child and/or adult protective services by providing information as requested a n d r e f e r r a l s . ( S e e : Abuse/Neglect: Reporting and Identification of Suspected Child Abuse, Elder and/or Dependent Adult Abuse, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pol icy). The Social Work Services Department is responsible for ensuring that the proper protective agencies are notified as required by county, state and federal laws (See: A ttachments). Each patient is provided with a written statement of patient rights and a notic e of privacy practices. These statements conform to all applicable state and federal laws, in cluding but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability act of 1996 (he reinafter referred to as HIPAA). These policies are available through HMH intranet. Patient Information We are committed to ensuring confidentiality of records and rel ated information for all patients. Consistent with HIPAA, we do not use, disclose or dis cuss patient-specific information, including patient financial information, with othe rs unless it is necessary to serve the patient or required by law. HMH Staff must never use or disclose confidential information th at violates the privacy rights of our patients. In accordance with our privacy and secu rity policies and procedures, which reflect HIPAA requirements, no HMH Staff has a right to an y patient information other than that necessary to perform his or her job or responsi bilities. Any breach of confidentiality represents a failure to meet the professional a nd ethical standards expected, and constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct. A full confidentiality statement is received and accepted by each employee as part of the Employee Handbook . We also expect our vendors involved in patient care to perform and provide services HMH's Patient Safety Hotline: (707) 456-3010 3. complaint@jointcommission.org 4consistent laws. We include HIPAA Bus iness Associate language in our agreements with these vendors. Emergency Treatment We follow the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) in providing an emergency medical screening examination and necessary stabil ization to all patients, regardless of ability to pay. Provided we have the capacity and capability, anyone with an emergency medical condition is treated. In an emergency situati on or if the patient is in labor, we will not delay the medical screening and necessary st abilization treatment in order to seek financial and demographic information. We do not admit, discharge, or transfer a patient with an emergency medical condition simply b ased on their ability or inability to pay or any other discriminatory factor. A patient with an emergency medical condition is only transferr ed to another facility at the patient's request or if the patient's medical needs cannot be m et at HMH and appropriate care is knowingly available at another facility. Patients are o nly transferred in strict compliance with state and federal EMTALA regulatory and statuto ry requirements. Our Responsibilities to and with our Physicians Healthcare services like those owned and operated by HMH are a c ollaboration between HMH Staff and HMH Medical Staff members. As in any collaboration, each party has important roles and responsibilities. HMH is committed to providi ng an excellent work environment for HMH Medical Staff. HMH Staff interacts with HMH Me dical Staff members in a respectful and supporting way. We require HMH Medical Staff members to be familiar with this Code of Conduct. HMH Medical Staff are governed by Med ical Staff Rules and Regulations. a. Interactions with Physicians: Federal and state laws and regulations govern the relationship between hospitals and physicians who may refer patients to HMH. The applicable federa l laws include the Anti-Kickback Law and the Stark Law. It is important that HMH St aff who interact with physicians (particularly those HMH Staff who make payments to ph ysicians for services rendered, provide space or services to physicians, recruit phys icians to the community, and/or arrange for physicians to serve in leadership positions in the organization) are aware of the requirements of the laws, regulations, and policie s that address relationships between HMH and physicians. If relationships with p hysicians are properly structured, but not dilig ently administered, such fail ure to administer the arrangements as agreed results in a violation of the law. Any a rrangement with a physician must be structured to ensure compliance with legal re quirements. Most arrangements must be in writing and approved by the Compliance Department. Failure to meet all requirements of these laws and regulations can resu lt in serious consequences for HMH. b. We do not pay for referrals . We accept patient referral and admissions based solely on the p atient's medical needs and our ability to render the needed services. We do not pay or offer to pay anyone - staff, physicians, or other persons or entities - for the referra l of patients. 07/22/2013 5c. We do not accept payments for referrals we make. No HMH Staff member or any other person acting on behalf of HMH, is permitted to solicit or receive anything of value, directly or indirectly, i n exchange for the referral of patients. Similarly, when making patient referrals to another h ealthcare provider, we do not take into account the volume or value of referrals that the provider has made to AH. d. We do not Extend Business Cour tesies and/or Tokens of Appreci ation to Potential Referral Sources, Outside of the HMH Policies . Any entertainment, gift or token of appreciation involving phys icians or other persons who are in a position to refer patients to HMH must be undertake n in accordance with HMH policies. These policies were developed to be in compliance with federal laws, regulations, and rules regarding these practices. HMH Staff must consult HMH policies or our Compliance Department prior to extending any business co urtesy or token of appreciation to a potential referral source. Our Responsibilities to Ensure Legal and Regulatory Compliance HMH provides many types of healthca re services. These services a re provided pursuant to appropriate federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and federal conditions of participation. Such laws, regulations, and conditions of partic ipation may include, but are not limited to, subjects such as certificates of need, licenses , permits, accreditations, access to treatment, consent to treatment, medical record-keepi ng, access to medical records and confidentiality, patients' rights, clinical researc h , e n d o f l i f e c a r e d e c i s i o n making, and Medicare and Medicaid program requirements. The org anization is subject to other numerous laws in addition to these healthcare laws, regul ations, and the conditions of participation. HMH has developed policies and procedures to address many legal, accreditation, certification and regulatory requirements. However, it is impra ctical to develop policies and procedures that encompass the full body of applicable law, stan dards, conditions and regulations. Such laws, standards, conditions and regulations no t covered in organizational policies and procedures must still be followed. There is a rang e of expertise within HMH, including operations counsel and numerous functional experts, w ho should be consulted for advice concerning human resources, legal regulations and st atutes, established standards and applicable conditions of participation. Anyone aware of violations or suspected violations of laws, reg ulations, standards and the conditions of participation, or HMH policies and procedures must report them immediately. There are many individuals to whom HMH Staff may voice such conc erns including supervisors, any member of the HMH Leadership Team, the Vice Pre sident of Human Resources, the Compliance Officer, the Compliance Department, t he Adventist Health Compliance Officer or Compliance hotline. Accreditation and Surveys From time to time, government agencies and other entities condu ct surveys at HMH. Accreditation or external agency surveys are extremely signific ant and broader than the scope of this Code of Conduct. In preparation for, during and after surveys, HMH Staff 07/22/2013 6must comply with all accrediting and external agency surveyors i n a d i r e c t , o p e n a n d honest manner and with accurate information. In preparation for, or during a survey or inspection, HMH Staff must never conceal, destroy, or alter any documents, lie; or make misleading statem ents to the agency representative. Also, HMH Staff must never attempt to cause anot her staff member to fail to provide accurate information or obstruct, mislead, or delay the communication of information or records relating to a possible violation of law. No action should ever be taken, directly or indirectly, to mislead the accrediting or ex ternal agency survey teams. Federal and State False Claims Acts Federal and State False Claims Acts prohibit any person or enti ty from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a fal se or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, or knowingly making or using, or causing t o made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved. The penalties for violating the Federal or State False Claims A ct include: xCivil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each false claim submitted; xUp to three times the amount of damages the government sustain s because of the false claim; and, xThe costs of the legal action brought to recover for the false claim. A private citizen may file suit under the Federal and State Fal se Claims Acts on behalf of the government if the citizen has direct and independent knowle dge of the submission of a false claim. The government will then decide whether to interve ne and take over the case, dismiss or settle the case, or let the private individual pursu e the case on his or her own. In either case, the person who initially filed the case may receiv e a portion of the amount recovered in either litigation or settlement of the claim. Whistleblower Protections Both the Federal and State False Claims Acts prohibit employers from retaliating or discriminating against an employee who, acting in good faith, i nvestigates, reports or assists in uncovering a false claim or statement. An employee who suffers discrimination or retaliation based on protected activities has the right to sue under the both the Federal and State False Claims Act. If the employee can prove that his or her employer retaliated against him or her fo r engaging in protected activity, the employee is entitled to be \"made whole.\" The reme dies may include: xReinstatement of the employee to his or her position; xTwo times the amount of back pay; xInterest on the back pay; and, xCompensation for any special damages (including litigation cost s and reasonable attorneys' fees). As noted above, it is the policy of Adventist Health and its Aff iliates that no employee shall be punished solely on the basis that he or she reported what he or she reasonably believed to be an act of wrongdoing or a violation of the Adven tist Health Corporate Compliance Program. 07/22/2013 7Your local compliance officer can provide more detailed informa tion regarding the protections afforded employees under the Federal and State Fals e Claims Acts. Our Responsibilities in Safegua rding Business and Financial Information Accuracy, Retention, and Disposal of Documents and Records Each HMH Staff member is responsible for the integrity and accur acy of our organization's documents and records, not only to comply with regulatory and l egal requirements, but also to ensure that records are available to support our busine ss practices and actions. No one may alter or falsify information on any record or document. Records must never be destroyed in an effort to deny governmental authorities informa tion that may be relevant to a government investigation. Medical and business documents and records are retained in acco rdance with the law and our record retention policy. Medical and business documents inc lude paper documents such as letters and memos, computer-based information such as e -mail or computer files on disk or tape, and any other medium that contains information about the organization or its business activities. It is important to retain and destroy records only acco rding with our policy. HMH Staff must not tamper with records. No one may remove or destroy records prior to the specified date without first obtaining permission as outlined in the HMH records management policy. Coding and Billing for Services We communicate our billing policies to all our patients prior t o, or, at the time of service or admission. We bill our patients for services rendered and provi de itemized bills free of charge upon request. Our patient financial services office resp onds to patient questions in a timely and courteous manner. We perform annual audits to ensu re the accuracy of our bills. We make adjustments to correct any over or under billing s. We have implemented policies, procedures and systems to facilit ate accurate billing to our government payers, commercial insurance payers, and patients. T hese policies, procedures, and systems conform to pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. We prohibit any HMH Staff member from knowingly presenting or causi ng to be presented claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious, or f raudulent. In support of accurate billing, medical records must provide re liable documentation of the services we provided. It is important that all individuals who contribute to the medical record provide accurate information and do not destroy any info rmation considered part of the official medical record. Accurate and timely documentation also depends on the diligence and attention of physicians who treat patients in our facilities. We expect physicians to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner. Confidential Information: The term \"confidential information\" refers to proprietary infor mation about our organization's strategies and operations as well as patient inf o r m a t i o n a n d t h i r d p a r t y information. Improper use or disclosure of confidential informa tion could violate legal and 07/22/2013 8ethical obligations. HMH Staff may use confidential information onl y t o per f or m t hei r j ob responsibilities. We do not share this information with others unless the individuals, entities, and/or contractual business relationships have a legi timate need to know. Consistent with HIPAA, we do not use, disclose or discuss patie nt specific information, including patient financial information, with others unless it is necessary to serve the patient or required by law .Any breach of confidentiality represents a failure to meet the professional and ethical standards expected, and constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct. A full confidentiality statement is received and acce pted by each employee as part of the HMH Employee Handbook. Cost Reports We are required by federal and state laws and regulations to su bmit certain reports outlining our operating costs and statistics. We comply with fe deral and state laws, regulations, and guidelines relating to all cost reports. These laws, regulations, and guidelines define what costs are allowable and outline the appr opriate methodologies we may use to claim reimbursement for the cost of services provide d. All issues related to the preparation, submission and settlemen t of cost reports must be performed in accordance with the Adventist Health Cost Reportin g Program Policies and Procedures. Electronic Medical and Security Requirements All communication systems, including but not limited to compute rs, electronic mail, Intranet, Internet access, telephones, and voice mail, are the property of the organization and are to be used primarily for business purposes in accordanc e with electronic communication policies and procedures.

HMH Staff who abuse our communication systems or use them excess ively for non- business purposes may lose these privileges and be subject to di sciplinary action. HMH Staff must comply with HMH's information security policies a nd standards governing the use of our information systems. User IDs and passwords are assigned to an individual. HMH Staff are not permitted to share or disclose any password th at is used to access HMH's systems or information. Financial Reporting and Records HMH maintains a high standard of accuracy and completeness in do cumenting, managing, and reporting financial information. This information serves as a basis for managing our business and is important in meeting our obligations to patient s, staff, suppliers, and others. It is also necessary for compliance with tax and financ ial reporting requirements. All financial information must reflect actual transactions and conform to generally-accepted accounting principles. All funds or assets must be properly rec orded. HMH maintains a 07/22/2013 9system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance tha t all transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and are recorded in a proper manner to maintain accountability of the assets. Intellectual Property Rights and Obligations Any work of authorship, inventions, or other creation created b y a staff member during the scope of his or her employment with HMH shall be considered the property of HMH, including any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or oth er intellectual property right. Our Responsibilities to Our HMH Staff Conflict of Interest A conflict of interest may occur if a HMH Staff's outside activi ties, personal financial interest, or other private interest interfere or appear to inte rfere with his or her ability to make objective decisions in the course of his or her job respon sibilities. Conflicts of interest also arise when a HMH Staff member or a member of his or her fam ily receives improper benefits as a result of his or her position in HMH. HMH Staff are obligated to ensure they remain free of conflicts of interest in the performance of thei r responsibilities at HMH. Clinical decisions are made wit hout regard to com pensation or p ersonal financial benefit to HMH leaders, managers, clinical staff, or licensed independent p ractitioners. You are encouraged to raise any questions involving this policy with th e Vice President for Human Resources or the Compliance Department before becoming engaged in outside activities or relationships that may give rise to an actual or perceived c onflict. If HMH Staff do become involved in a transaction where personal i nterests conflict with HMH's interests, they are required to disclose that conflict to a supervisor, the Human Resources Department or the Compliance Department. HMH Board me mbers, executives, and directors are required to sign a Conflict of Inter est Statement in accordance with the HMH Conflict of Interest Policy. No waiver of this conflict of interest provision may be granted unless approved in advance by the Compliance Committee. Controlled Substances/ Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace The dangers of drug and/or alcohol abuse are numerous, includin g the risks of loss of life, physical damage to people and property, a decline in morale and productivity, and deterioration in the quality of goods and services produced. Ou r policy is to maintain a drug/alcohol-free workplace. Thus, the unlawful manufacture, di stribution, dispensing, possession or use of a controlled substance or alcohol is prohi bited in our workplace. All HMH Staff must report for work free of the influence of alcohol and illegal drugs. Any HMH Staff member who reports to work under the influence of any ill egal drug or alcohol, has an illegal drug in his or her system, or who uses, possesses, or s ells illegal drugs while on HMH work time or property may be terminated immediately. We may use drug testing as a means of enforcing this policy. Some of our staff routinely have access to prescription drugs, controlled substances, and other medical supplies. Many of these substances are governed a nd monitored by specific regulatory organizations and must be administered by physician o rder only. Prescription 07/22/2013 10and controlled medications and supplies must be handled properl y and only by authorized individuals to minimize risks to HMH and to patients. Any HMH Sta ff member who becomes aware of inadequate security of drugs or controlled sub stances or the diversion of drugs from the organization must report it immediately. As a condition of continued employment, HMH Staff are expected a nd required to abide by this policy and to notify their department manager of any crimi nal drug/alcohol statute conviction against them no later than 5 calendar days after suc h conviction. A conviction means a finding of guilt, including a plea of nolo contender or imposition of a sentence or both by any judicial body charg ed with the responsibility to de termine violations of the federal or state criminal drug/ alcohol statutes. Diversity and Equal Emp loyment Opportunity HMH actively promotes diversity in its workforce at all levels o f the organization. We are committed to providing an inclusive work environment where ever yone is treated with fairness, dignity, and respect. We are accountable to each othe r for the manner in which we treat one another and for the manner in which people around us are treated. We are committed to recruiting and retaining a diverse staff that is r eflective of the patients and community we serve. We regard laws, regulations and policies re lating to diversity as a minimum standard. We strive to create and maintain a setting in which we celebrate cultural and other differences and consider them strengths. HMH maintains an equal opportunity workforce and no one shall un lawfully discriminate against any individual with regard to race, color, religion, ge nder, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, g ender identity or veteran stat us with respect to any offer, or term or condition, of employment. We make reasonable accommodat ions to the known physical and mental limitation of qualified individuals with di sabilities. Harassment and Disruptive Behavior HMH seeks to provide a work environment that is free of all form s of discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment and disruptive behavior .Prohibited forms of discriminatory harassment include, but are not limited to, oral , physical or visual harassment. HMH considers unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual fa vors, remarks or jokes of a sexual nature, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature to constitute sexual harassment when: I. submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or impli citly a term or condition of an individual's employment; II. employment decisions concerning an individual are based on w h e t h e r t h e p e r s o n submitted to or rejected the harassing action; and/or III. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably inte rfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, host ile or offensive working environment\u2014even where it leads to no tangible or economic job consequences. We strongly disapprove of discriminatory harassment in any form . We do not tolerate harassment by anyone based on the cultural backgrounds of those who work with us. Degrading or humiliating jokes, slurs, intimidations, or other harassing conduct is not 07/22/2013 11acceptable in our workplace. Sexual harassment is considered t o be sex discrimination in violation of applicable state and federal law subjecting the ha rassing employee to legal liability. HMH Staff who observe or experience any form of alleged discrimi nation, discriminatory harassment or violence should be reported to either a departmen t head or the Human Resources department. The law protects HMH Staff from any retali ation for reporting or participating in the investigation of discrimination or discrim inatory harassment. A prompt and thorough investigation of the alleged incident will be cond ucted. To the extent possible, the investigation and any subsequent action will proc eed in an atmosphere of confidentiality. We will take all appropriate steps to enforce this policy, including termination or other disciplinary action, against persons who h ave violated this policy. HMH Staff who have submitted a complaint of discrimination or di scriminatory harassment addressed under this policy should immediately make a further c omplaint if the discrimination or discriminatory harassment resumes. Health and Safety HMH complies with all workplace health and safety rules and regu lations. Our policies and practices are designed to protect our staff from potential work place hazards. HMH Staff need to be familiar with these policies and how they apply to t heir specific job responsibilities. Each staff member should seek advice from his or her supervisor, or the hospital's Safety Officer, whenever he/she has a question or co ncern. It is important that each staff member immediately advise a supervisor or the Safety Officer of any serious workplace injury or any situation presenting a danger of injury . Immediate notification allows for timely corrective actions. Environmental Compliance It is HMH policy to comply with all environmental laws and regul ations as they relate to HMH's operations. We act to preserve our natural resources to t he full extent reasonably possible. HMH complies with all environmental laws and operates its facilities with the necessary permits, approvals, and controls. We diligently emplo y the proper procedures to provide a good environment of care and to prevent pollution. In helping HMH comply with these laws and regulations, all HMH St aff must understand how job duties may impact the environment. Staff must adhere to all requirements for the proper handling of hazardous material, and immediately alert su pervisors to any situation regarding the discharge of a hazardous substance, improper disp osal of haz ardous and medical waste, or any situation that may be potential damaging to the environment. Hiring of Former and Current Gove rnment and Medicare Administra tive Contractor Employees The recruitment and employment of former or current U.S. govern ment employees may be impacted by regulations concerning conflicts of interest. Hirin g employees directly from a Medicare Administrative Contractor requires certain regulatory notifications. Staff should consult with the Human Resources Department or the Compliance D epartment regarding such recruitment and hiring. 07/22/2013 12Ineligible Persons We do not contract with, employ, or bill for services rendered by any individual or entity: (1) that is excluded or ineligible to participate in federal he althcare programs; (2) that was suspended or debarred from federal government contracts and not reinstated in a federal healthcare program after a period of exclusion, suspension, deb arment, or ineligibility; or (3) has been convicted of a criminal offense that falls within the scope of 42 U.S.C. 1320a- 7(a), but has not yet been excluded, debarred, suspended or oth erwise declared ineligible (each, an \"Ineligible Person\"). Upon hire we search the Departm ent of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General, Exclusive Parties List S ystem (EPLS) and General Services Administration's lists for such Ineligible Persons. All HMH Staff must disclose to HMH any debarment, exclusion, susp ension or other event that makes that person an Ineligible Person within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of such event. HMH will remove known Ineligible Persons f rom responsibility for, or involvement with, HMH's business operations related to Federal health care programs and will remove them from any position for which their compensation or the items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed by such individual are paid b y a Federal health care program or with Federal funds at least until such time as such individual is reinstated into participation in the Federal health care programs. If HMH has actual notice that a HMH Staff is charged with a crimin al offense that falls within the scope of 42 USC \u00a7 1320a-7(a), (b)(1)-(3), or if prop osed for exclusion during such individual's employment or contract term HMH will take all appropriate actions to ensure that the responsibilities of such individual have not an d shall not adversely affect the quality of care rendered to any patient or any claims submi tted to a Federal health care program. Insider Information/Confidential Information In the course of employment with Frank R. Howard Memorial Hospi tal, HMH Staff may become aware of non-public information about HMH that is materia l to the HMH's business strategy and operations. Non-public, material information may i nclude, among other things, plans for mergers, marketing strategy, financial results, or ot her business dealings. HMH Staff may not discuss this type of information with anyone outs ide the organization. Within the organization, HMH Staff should discuss this information on a strictly \"need-to-know\" basis and only with other HMH Staff who require this information to perform their jobs. License and Certification Renewals HMH Staff, individuals retained as independent contractors, and privileged practitioners in positions which require professional licenses, certifications, or other credentials are responsible for maintaining current credentials and shall compl y at all times with federal and state requirements applicable to their respective disciplin es. HMH does not allow any HMH Staff member, independent contractor o r privileged practitioner to work without a valid, current license or creden tial. Each HMH Staff member must have evidence of current and valid license, certification, registration, accreditation or credential as required by their position description. 07/22/2013 13Copyright and Intellectual Property HMH respects the ownership rights of those creating physical, di gital, and intellectual property. Copyright infringement is using copyrighted property without the owner's permission. This unauthorized use is also called piracy. Exam ples could include using unlicensed software, distributing many copies of non-public boo ks or articles, and using business models (intellectual property) without consent or cred it. HMH Staff will not utilize copyrighted physical, digital, and intellectual property withou t the prior written permission of the owner. Personal Use of HMH Resources Credit cards, desks, and other items provided by HMH continue to remain organizational property, must be maintained in accordance with HMH's policies, and used only for business purposes. HMH reserves the right to monitor and inspect all organizational property, without notice, and without the HMH Staff member prese nt. HMH may monitor and inspect organizational property even if a password or perso nal code has been assigned. Prior authorization must be obtained before the remov al of any organizational property from the premises. All organizational property must be returned immediately upon request or termination in the same condition as when originally provided. Personal items brought onto the organization's property also are subject to in spection, without notice, and without the HMH Staff member present. Relationships among HMH Staff In the normal day-to-day functions of an organization like HMH, there are issues that arise from how people in the organization relate to one another. It i s impossible to foresee all of these issues, and many do not require explicit treatment in thi s Code of Conduct. While we wish to avoid any strict rules, no one should ever feel compell ed to give a gift to anyone for a birthday, holiday or other celebration, and any gifts offered or received should be appropriate to the circumstances. A lavish gift to anyone in a supervisory role would clearly violate organization policy. Similarly, If HMH agrees to support a charitable organization, no HMH Staff member should feel compelled to contribute to the ch aritable organization, nor should there be any workplac e consequences of such non-part icipation. For reasons of supervision, safety, security and morale, family members will not be employed under the direct supervision of one another nor will t hey be placed in the same department, division or facility if the work involves potential conflicts of interest. For these reasons, as well to avoid misunderstandings, complaints of favo ritism or possible claims of sex discrimination or sexual harassment, managers and superviso rs are prohibited from establishing, maintaining, or attempting to establish or mainta in a romantic or sexual relationship with any subordinate employee within their chain o f command. The term \"family members\" includes a HMH Staff member's parents, children (natural, adopted or under legal guardianship), spouse, brothers, sisters, grandpare nts, grandchildren, cousins, aunts, uncles, in-laws and step-relationships with all the prec eding relationships. An exception to this policy is allowed only with the approval of t he Vice President of Human Resources. If co-employees become related, or if a supervisor and a subord inate attempt to or establish or maintain a romantic or sexual relationship, it sho uld be reported promptly to the immediate supervisor of the manager or supervisor who is re lated or involved in the 07/22/2013 14relationship. If co-employees become related, we will make reas onable efforts to assign job duties so as to minimize problems of supervision, safety, s ecurity or morale. Relationships with Subc ontractors and Suppliers HMH has a Code of Conduct and Business Relationship Statement th at outlines its commitment to ethical and compliant behavior and its expectatio ns of the same by its contractors. We treat our vendors fairly and maintain impartial ity in our relationships. We do not allow our friendships with our vendors or others with wh om we may do business in the future to affect our business decisions. Charitable gifts or contributions from vendors are not required , and have no bearing upon their actual or potential business relationship with us. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, subsidies to underwrite the costs of medical e ducation or professional meetings are permitted, in that they benefit patient care and c ommunity health. HMH Staff must manage consulting, subcontractor, and supplier re lationships in a fair and reasonable manner, free from conflicts of interest and consiste nt with all applicable laws. HMH promotes competitive procurement to the maximum extent pract icable. HMH's selection of consultants, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendor s will be made on the basis of objective criteria including quality, technical excellence, price, delivery, adherence to schedules, service, and maintenance of adequate sources of supp ly. Our purchasing decisions will be made on the supplier's ability to meet our ne eds, and not on personal relationships and friendships. HMH employs the highest ethical s tandards in business practices in source selection, negotiation, determination of co n t r a c t a w a r d s , a n d t h e administration of all purchasing activities. HMH complies with c ontractual obligations not to disclose vendor confidential information unless permitted under the contract or otherwise authorized by the vendor. It is critical to avoid the appearance of impropriety when givi ng gifts to individuals who do business or are seeking to do business with HMH. HMH will never u se gifts or other incentives to improperly influence relationships or business ou tcomes. Our Responsibilities while Developing Business and Marketing Se rvices HMH operates in a highly competitive environment. HMH's business development and marketing activities must conform to the highest standards of i ntegrity and fairness reflected in this Code of Conduct. HMH requires compliance with antitrust and other laws governing competitive activities. Antitrust and Unfair Competition HMH restricts communication with competitors. Generally, HMH Staf f are not to discuss with competitors non-public \"competitively sensitive topics.\" B ecause the antitrust laws are so complex and their application can depend upon the conditions in local markets, it is not practical to adopt written polices to govern all situations. HM H Staff should consult with their supervisors or the Compliance Department for guidance con cerning competitive activities, laws and polices relating to their areas of respons ibility. 07/22/2013 15Marketing and Advertising Consistent with laws and regulations that governs such activiti es, HMH uses marketing and advertising to educate the public, provide information to t he community, increase awareness of services provided by HMH, and for recruitment purp oses. HMH strives to present only truthful, fully informative, and non-deceptive inf ormation in these materials and announcements. HMH will not distort the truth about services or products provided by the hospital, nor will we attack or disparage another provider, whether by name or implication, in any marketing or advertising efforts. We may fe ature our outstanding services or offer factual evidence of quality of care, but will not claim superiority where it cannot be substantiated. Our Responsibilities in our Relat ionships with other Companies This part of the Code of Conduct should not be considered in an y way as an encouragement to make, solicit, or receive any type of entrainm ent or gift. Receiving Business Courtesies We do not expect any gifts from our vendors beyond good service . However, HMH recognizes that there will be times when a current or potential business associate, including a potential referral source, extends an invitation to a HMH Staff member to attend a social event, in order to further develop or provide apprecia tion of a current business relationship. All gifts, entertainment and business meals prov ided or received must be reasonable and small enough that they do not influence our deci sions. We never offer or accept anything of value in exchange for referrals or other bus iness. We let our vendors, physicians, customers and others know that our core values limi t what we can receive or give. We want our services and business relationships to stand on their own. What is a gift? It is anything of value - including traditional m arketing items like t-shirts or logoed items - if the recipient receives it for free. We should recognize there is a difference between a simple pen and an expensive electronic device from a vendor. What constitutes entertainment? This includes an invitation to e vents, sports activities or games or concerts where the recipient is not expected to pay fo r a ticket or participation fee. We should recognize there is a difference between attending a community-supported or non-profit gala and front-row seats at an expensive event. What constitutes a business meal? This is any meal where the pri mary purpose of the meeting is to discuss HMH business or quality initiatives. If you question a gift or participation in an entertainment eve nt, contact the Compliance Department. Extending Business Court esies to Non-Referral Sources 1. Meals and Entertainment. - There may be times when a HMH Staff member wishes to extend to a current or potential business associate (other t han someone who may be in a position to make a patient referral) an invitation to a ttend a social event (e.g., reception, meal, sporting event) to further or develop a busine ss relationship. The purpose of the entertainment must never be to induce any favora ble business 07/22/2013 16action. During these events, topics of a business nature must b e discussed and the host must be present. 2. Sponsoring Business Events - HMH sponsors events for legitimate business purposes (e.g., hospital board meetings or retreats). These eve nts may include HMH paid meals, entertainment, transportation and lodging. Howev er, all elements of these events, including these courtesy elements, must be con sistent with the corporate policy on business events. 3. Gifts - It is critical to avoid the appearance of impropriety when giving gifts to individuals who do business or are seeking to do business with HMH. We will never use gifts or other incentives to improperly influence relations hips or business outcomes. In order to avoid embarrassment, an effort should be made to ensure that any gift we extend meets the business conduct standards of the recipient's organization. U.S. federal and state governments have strict ru les and laws regarding gifts, means and other business courtesies for their employees. HMH does not provide any gifts, entertainment or anything else of v alue to any employee of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government or its fiscal intermediaries, except for minor refreshments in connection with business discu ssion. Our Responsibilities in our Relat ionships with Government Agenc ies and Officials HMH and its representatives comply with all federal, state, and local laws governing participation in government relations and political activities. As a general policy, HMH funds or resources will not contri bute directly to individual p olitical campaigns, political parties or other organizations that intend to use the funds pri marily for political campaign objectives. At times, HMH may ask HMH Staff to make personal contact with gove rnment officials or to write letters to present our positions on specific issues. I n addition, it is part of the role of some HMH management to interface on a regular basis with governm ent officials. If a HMH Staff member is making these communications on behalf of the organization, he/she must be certain to be familiar with any regulatory constraints and observe them. At no time may HMH Staff speak on behalf of HMH without first being given co nsent by the CEO or his/her designee. Avenues of communication may include traditio nal ways such as telephone and letters along with newer ways such as social medi a. Guidance is always available from the Compliance Department as necessary. How We Ensure Compliance with our Code of Conduct Program Structure The Compliance Program is intended to demonstrate in the cleare st possible terms our absolute commitment to the highest standards of conduct, ethics , and compliance. The elements of the program include setting standards, communicating those standards, providing mechanisms for reporting concerns, monitoring and aud iting, program effectiveness, and maintaining an organizational structure that continues to support the Compliance Program. These elements are supported at all levels of HMH. The Corporate Compliance Committee is responsible for providing direction, gu idance and oversight to senior leadership and the Local Compliance Committee. 07/22/2013 17The HMH Compliance Officer and the Compliance Department are res ponsible for the day- to-day direction, coordination and any applicable revisions or updates of the Code of Conduct and the Compliance Program. This includes developing re sources (including policies and procedures, training programs, and communication t ools), distributing standards, providing support (including operating the Complianc e hotline, conducting program assessment, and providing advice), ensuring compliance with training requirements and otherwise administering the program. In support of the HMH Compliance Officer, HMH Senior Leaders have expertise in various areas of compliance and are called upon to lead policy and trai ning development efforts, conduct monitoring and auditing as appropriate, and provide adv ice. Additionally, the Vice President of Human Resources, the hospital Risk Manager, and th e Accreditation Coordinator are all important resources that may be accessed to address issues arising out of this Code of Conduct. HMH's Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring the functi oning of the Local Compliance Committee. Setting Standards HMH sets standards (see Attachment A) through this Code of Conduct , along with our associated policies and procedures and the annual or periodic (f or applicable positions) compliance program training. It is the responsibility of each i ndividual to be aware of these policies and procedures, how they pertain to his or her work, a nd to follow these policies and procedures. Training and Communication Comprehensive training and education has been developed to ensu re that HMH Staff are aware of the standards that apply to them. Code of Conduct trai ning is conducted at the time an individual joins HMH and annually for all HMH Staff. Comp liance training in areas of compliance risk (e.g., bi lling, coding, cost reports) is req uired of certain individuals. HMH and Adventist Health policies outline the training requirements . For HMH employees, all training is recorded within our complianc e education system. System administrators and the Compliance Officer can track empl oyee compliance with their training requirements and report such information as nece ssary. Non-employees will receive training as required by applicable requirements or regu lations. Personal Obligation to Report HMH is committed to ethical and legal conduct that is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations, and to correct wrongdoing wherever it may occur at HMH. Each HMH Staff has an individual responsibility to report any activity by any staff, physician, subcontractor, or vendor that appears to violate applicable law, rules, regula tions, accreditation standards, standards of medical practice, federal healthcare co nditions of participation, or this Code of Conduct. If any HMH Staff member or Board member has concerns, we encoura ge you to report it through one of our reporting compliance program options identifi ed below so that we may 07/22/2013 18investigate and resolve the issue. However, if you believe we have left an issue unresolved, the matter can be reported to other entities such a s Adventist Health, the Medical Board of California, The Joint Commission, and the Depa rtment of Public Health. There will be no retaliatory disciplinary action taken against any individual who reports concerns to any of these entities. Resources for Guidance and Reporting Concerns To obtain guidance on an ethics or compliance issue or to repor t a concern, individuals may choose from several options. We encourage the resolution of y o u r c o n c e r n s , a t a local level. You may report issues to your immediate supervisor or any member of the Leadership Team. Your other reporting options include: xCorporate Compliance Hotline (888) 366-3833 xPatient Safety Hotline (707) 456-3010 xHuman Resources Department (707) 456-3294 xPatient Privacy and Security (707) 456-3117 xPatient Financial Services (707) 456-3125 Our policies and procedures can be accessed through our Intrane t. HMH makes every effort to maintain, within the limits of the law , the confidentiality of the identity of any individuals who report concerns or possible mis conduct. HMH does not retaliate or discipline anyone for reporting a concern in good faith. Any staff member who deliberately makes a false accusation with the purpose of harmi ng or retaliating against another staff member is subject to discipline. Internal Investigations of Reports We are committed to investigating all reported concerns promptl y and confidentially to the extent possible. The Compliance Officer coordinates any finding s from investigations and immediately recommends corrective actions or changes that need to be made. We expect all staff to cooperate with investigation efforts. Corrective Action Where an internal investigation substantiates a reported violat ion, it is HMH's policy to initiate a corrective action, including, as appropriate, making prompt restitution of any overpayment amounts, notifying the appropriate governmental age ncy, instituting whatever disciplinary action is necessary, and implementing systemic cha nges to prevent a similar violation from recurring in the future.

I think that having a health coach is a great benefit provided by Adventist Health. It helps to have someone objective to talk with about my personal goals. It gives me an opportunity to step back and assess what I am doing, so that I can achieve better health.\" Lori has continued to check in with her health coach every few weeks regarding her progress toward her health goals.

SUPPORT, STRENGTH AND SUCCESS: LOSING 226.4 POUNDS WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS \"I started working on my weight in 2013 by joining Weight Watchers, which I am still active in. By February of 2014 I had lost 100 lbs. all from just eating better. At that time I was unable to exercise from the severe back pain I had, and I could barely walk or stand for five minutes at a time. From 2014 to 2015 I had stopped losing weight \u2014 I had plateaued, and whether I gained or lost weight, I was always within a couple pounds of the 100 I had lost. In May of 2015 I needed emergency back surgery and it was a complete success, even if I didn't think so at the time. After the surgery, I became depressed. I turned back to food for comfort and ended up gaining 60 lbs. back of what I had lost. In January of 2016 I started to focus on what was positive in my life and then on my weight. I started going to Weight Watchers meetings again and walking. It was in July of 2016 that I started going to the gym and exercising, and I still am going to the gym faithfully each week. Exercise was what was missing from my life, it is exactly what I needed. I currently weigh 221.2 pounds. Eating better, exercising, going to Weight Watchers and having the love and support of family, friends, co-workers and the community has been amazing and so very helpful.\"Matthew Hartke EMR coordinator, Home Health & Hospice Adventist Health Home Health & Hospice Services Mendocino CountyLivingWell: Adventist Health's whole-person health and wellness program LivingWell is offered to all employees and is required for all Engaged!

Adventist Health's LivingWell program has encouraged this already-fit pair to develop an even healthier lifestyle. You might think marathon runners couldn't possibly have much room to improve, but each of them credits the LivingWell program for important health outcomes. Vicki began running in 1987 with her husband. They were inspired by watching the Portland Marathon and wanted to do it for themselves. Starting with just one-mile runs, they worked their way up to full marathons. Vicki's husband, Gary, completed 72 marathons before he passed away in 2012. His goal was to run 100 marathons, which Vicki and Emillie have decided to complete in his memory. For Emillie, running marathons was something she picked up after her parents had started. She was overweight and decided she wanted to take control of her life. Vicki trained with her daughter and walked and ran with her during her first marathon. Training for marathons takes a lot of time, discipline and dedication. For Vicki and Emillie it's something they share. Through their weekly long runs they spend time talking and even in prayer. With the ultimate goal in sight, Vicki and Emillie have completed a marathon every two weeks since March 2017. Vicki completed her 100th marathon on July 15. INSPIRED BY LIVINGWELL \"Being part of an organization that emphasizes wellness means so much to me,\" says Vicki. \"The LivingWell program has helped me improve my health by changing how I eat. Because of classes and challenges that have been offered at work I've moved to a diet with more whole, plant-based foods. I used to be on medication for my blood pressure, but by eating differently I no longer need it.\" Emillie's experience is similar. \"It's a lot of small things,\" she says. \"From signs encouraging us to take the stairs, and information about walking routes on campus, there's a culture of being active. The LivingWell challenges give us the opportunity to explore new and different aspects of our health. A fruit and veggie challenge helped me jump start improvements in the way I was eating. That's helped me lower my cholesterol by 22 points.\" Vicki Classen, telephone operator at Adventist Health Portland, and her daughter, Emillie Niblack, customer care associate, are grateful for their health and fitness achievements. 11\"In January I was in a really bad place when it came to taking care of myself. In April 2017 I decided to go to the TakeTEN program in St. Helena. Three months later I am completely transformed, inside and out. I have lost 21 pounds and have re-prioritized both my physical and mental health. Looking back at pictures I can see now what I couldn't see then. It hasn't always been easy, but I know that I'm worth it. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm well on my way, and I know I won't ever go back. TakeTEN was a life-changing experience for me, and I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to go. Take care of yourself. Prioritize yourself. Believe in yourself. Love yourself.\" \u2014Jennifer Cowan, Engaged! Premier Program member 12Why do I have to complete LivingWell points if I am already healthy? LivingWell is a lifestyle.

A group of employees at Millsbridge Family Care, Adventist Health Lodi Memorial, decided it was time for a Biggest Loser Challenge. The eight-week challenge encouraged them to get into shape, eat healthier, and win a prize. Throughout the eight weeks, they motivated each other by holding everyone accountable to sticking to their weight loss strategies. Losing weight is not an easy task; however, a supportive environment greatly aids in achieving one's health goals. \"My strategies that drove success were working out just about every day, paying attention to what I was eating, and practicing portion control.\" After eight weeks she was able to drop 11.6 pounds. \"I learned that portion control was the key to success. I have always been very active with sports and exercise but lacked a true control over my eating habits. I'm now eating breakfast every day which works to shape the rest of my meals for the day.\" As a group, the Biggest Loser Challenge participants lost nearly 60 pounds.

You have the opportunity to redirect a portion of your wages on a pretax basis for benefits available through the Plan. Health care and dependent care expense reimbursements are administered through separate flexible spending accounts. WHAT IS THE WELFARE PLAN CONTRIBUTION BENEFIT? Your pretax dollars make contribution payments for coverage under your employer's group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plan. You make an election when you are hired and you complete the welfare plan enrollment forms. If you choose not to enroll when you are hired, you may add the benefit on a post - tax basis. The contributions will automatically roll over to pretax withholdings at the beginning of the next Plan Year. Your employer must receive written notification before a new Plan Year if you decide to change your withholdi ng election. When insignificant cost increases occur your employer will automatically change contribution deductions. Welfare plan benefits are payable based on the terms of these plans or policies. Benefit selections are subject to Cafeteria Plan qualifyi ng election change event rules that are similar to those in the table at Appendix A. Please discuss changes with Human Resources to ensure you comply with the IRS Regulations. WHAT IS THE HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT BENEFIT? Eligible health care expenses incurred but not reimbursed under any other health plan can be reimbursed from this account based on your redirection election. WHAT IS THE DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT BENEFIT? Eligible dependent care expenses incurred in order to enable you and your spouse to be employed can be reimbursed from this account based on your redirection election. SALARY REDIRECTION AGREEMENT You may elect to sign an agreement by which you authorize the Company to redirect a portion of your salary and contribute t he amount of that redirection on your behalf (as a before -tax contribution) to the benefit(s) of your choice. 2 WHAT IS THE CURRENT MAXIMUM AMOUNT A PARTICIPANT CAN CONTRIBUTE? The maximum spendable dollars for the Plan Year are $17,000. Welfare Plan contributions are limited to actual charges for coverages elected. The maximum annual Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account election is $2,600. The maximum annual Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account election is $5,000 for single employees and married employees who file joint returns. Married employees filing separate returns are limited to $2,500. MAY ELECTIONS BE CHANGED DURING A PLAN YEAR? The legal requirements of a Cafeteria Plan do not permit salary redirection election changes during a Plan Year unless a qualifying election change event occurs. In that case, you may make a new election due to and consistent with your qualifying event. The table in Appendix A details qualifying election change event scenarios allowed by the IRS. WHO IS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PLAN? Adventist Health is the Administrator of the Plan. Adventist Health has the right to interpret the Plan and to modify elections by employees in accordance with any legal requirements relating to the Plan. If I Need More Information, W hom Should I Contact? If you need more information about the Cafeteria Plan, please call the Flexible Spending Administrator, Benefits Administration at 800- 441-2524. Participating Employers The entities that have elected to participate in the Plan are: Adventist Health Corporate , Portland Adventist Medical Center, Hanford Community Hospital , Reedley Community Hospital , Adventist Health Physicians Network, Castle Medical Center, Feather River Hospital, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Willits Hospital, Lodi Memorial Hospital Association, Inc. , St. Helena Hospital Napa Valley , Adventist Health Clear lake Hospital, Inc. , San Joaquin Community Hospital, Simi Valley Hospital and Health Care Services , Sonora Community Hospital , Adventist Health Medical Center Tehachapi, Northwest Medical Foundation of Tillamook , Ukiah Adventist Hospital , Western Health Resources, and White Memorial Medical Center 3 CAFETERIA PLAN BOOKLET GENERAL INFORMATION AN OVERVIEW Adventist Health (the \"Company\") offers you the opportunity t o choose between cash and the following benefits: Welfare Plan Contribution Benefit Health Care Expense Reimbursement Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Under the welfare plan contribution benefit, the dollar amounts that you elect to redirect from yo ur salary on a pretax basis under this Plan will be used to make contribution payments for coverage periods occurring within the Plan Year under the (i) group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plans. . Your pretax salary reduction amounts will be paid directly to the plan(s) or insurer(s). Benefits will be payable according to the terms of the respective plans or policies. In addition, the two reimbursement account options allow you to pay eligible health care and dependent care expenses with before- tax earnings. All three options reduc e your income taxes below what you would pay if you bought the same coverages on an after -tax basis . When you participate, you agree to redirect part of your paycheck for your welfare plan or reimbursement account contributions before Social Security and federal and state income taxes have been withheld. You pay less in taxes because your taxable income is reduced by the amount of your redirection. After you incur eligible expenses, you request reimbursement from th e appropriate account in tax -free dollars. Note: No actual accounts are established, the Flexible Spending Accounts are merely bookkeeping accounts established to keep track of your contributions. Benefits are paid as needed from the Company's general as sets. Redirection of your wages reduces your salary for Social Security purposes. You may receive a lower Social Security benefit at retirement, death or during disability. This employee booklet and the attached table in Appendix A (collectively the \"booklet\") describe the basic features of the Adventist Health System/West Cafeteria Plan (the \"Plan\" or \"Cafeteria Plan\" ), how it operates and how you can get the maximum advantage from it. The Company has established the Plan pursuant to a P lan Document in to which this booklet has been incorporated. However, if there is a conflict between the official P lan Document and the booklet, the P lan Document will govern. Coverage under the group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plans is discussed in a summar y or an official certificate of coverage you receive from the Administrator of the Plan or insurance carrier. If there is a discrepancy between this booklet and the summary or certificate of coverage you receive from the Administrator of the Plan or insur ance carrier, the summary or certificate of coverage will govern. 4 ELIGIBILITY You are eligible to participate in the Plan if you are a regular full -time, part -time, or per diem employee as those classifications are defined in the applicable Participating Employer's personnel policy and procedure manual. DATE OF PARTICIPATION If you are an eligible employee, you will become a Participant in the Plan on the first day of the pay period following your completion of the necessary enrollment forms. Welfare plans may have different effective dates. Please refer to those Plan Documents. If you become an eligible employee after the Plan Year has begun, you must enroll in the Plan within the first 31 days of becoming an eligible employee. If you do not enroll when you are first eligible, you must wait to enroll in the Plan until the next annual enrollment period unless you experience a qualifying election change event. Welfare plans may allow enrollment throughout the Plan Year. The contributions will not be wit hheld on a pretax basis if the enrollment does not occur within the first 31 days of becoming an eligible employee. The enrollment period will be held annually, at dates set by the Administrator of the Plan, before the beginning of the Plan Year for which elections are being made. If you enroll during the enrollment period, you must wait until the next annual enrollment period to change your elections, except in certain cases where you have a qualifying election change event. The table in Appendix A deta ils qualifying election change event scenarios allowed by the IRS. ENROLLING IN THE PLAN During the annual enrollment period (or during the first 31 days after you become an eligible employee), you need to indicate whether you want to participate in any of the following: Welfare Plan C ontribution Benefit Health Care Expense Reimbursement Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement You may, of course, decline participation if you wish. As an eligible employee, you will have an opportunity to enroll once each year. If you fail to make an election during the annual enrollment period, your elections will remain the same for the following Plan Year for the welfare plan contribution benefit. To continue participating in the reimbursement accounts, you must re -enroll eac h year during the annual enrollment period. CHANGING OR STOPPING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS Your contribution (your election) amount will stay in place for the coverage period, unless you have a qualifying election change event. The change to your Salary Redirect ion Agreement must be requested during the 31- day period immediately after the qualifying change and must be due to and consistent with such change. (Please refer to the CHANGE IN BENEFIT ELECTIONS FORM .) The Administrator of the Plan will review and eit her approve or deny the request for the change in election. If approved, the change will be effective the first pay period AFTER the approval is granted, except in the case of birth, adoption or placement for adoption in which case the change will be effe ctive the date of the event when the enrollment form is received within 30 days of the event. 5 If you take a general leave of absence other than a leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), you may elect to continue participation in the Plan and pay your share of contributions with after-tax dollars while on leave Alternatively, you may prepay the contributions for the expected duration of the leave on a pretax salary reduction basis out of your pre -leave salary. If you elect to prepay your share of the contributions before your leave, you must make a special election to that effect before the first pay period for which the deductions will be made. Dependent care accounts must be terminated or suspended prior to taking a Leave of Absence as expenses for daycare/childcare are not eligible for reimbursement while out on leave. If you elect to terminate coverage during an unpaid Leave of Absence, you must submit a Change in Benefit Elections form (1) before your leave and (2) another form within 31 days after returning to work in order to reinstate participation. Reinstatement will be at the same rates of coverage in effect before the Leave of Absence unless there has been another qualifying election change event. TRANSFERS BETWEEN PARTICIPATING EMPLOYE RS If you transfer from one Participating Employer to another, the health care and dependent care expense reimbursement benefits you elected will transfer with you. You will have to re- enroll for the welfare -plan contribution salary reduction; however, this will not be considered a change in election. Your health plan and AD&D coverage must remain the same as that originally elected with the first employer unless a qualifying election change event occurs as a result of the transfer. In that case, an election change may be made consistent with such qualifying election change event. PLAN YEAR January 1 through December 31. COVERAGE PERIOD Period during Plan Year you are an Eligible Employee and have elected to participate in the Plan. DEBIT CARD The flexi ble spending account offers the Take Care debit card. The Take Care debit card through Adventist Health is a great way to pay for your eligible medical, dental, vision and pharmacy expenses. You can elect a debit card on MyFlexOnline.com under the Card Center tab . The card is good for up to 3 years if an election has been made for each plan year. Certain expenses do not require additional documentation while some do. Please see a few examples below to help better address when you need to send in documents f or verification. Services that do not require verification: -Doctor office co- pays -Prescriptions -ER co -pays Services that do require verification include but are not limited to: -Dental procedures -Glasses & Contacts -Major surgeries -Medical Equipment In the event that an expense is not eligible/overpayment has been made and the card has been used, we will adjust the claim to the correct dollar amount, and suspend the debit card until the balance is repaid. 6 WHEN PARTICIPATION ENDS Your participation ends as of the date one or more of the following occurs: Employment with the Company ends You are no longer eligible to participate (see ELIGIBILITY on page 4 ) When Participant fails to make contributions during an unpaid leave of absence or after termin ation of employment. (Special rules apply to a FMLA.) Date Participant revokes Election to Participate due to and consistent with a qualify election change event For the health and dependent care reimbursement account options, the January 1 following an enrollment period in which you do not elect to contribute to the account(s); however, if you have a balance in your account on the last day of the Plan Year, you may continue to participate through the grace period as applicable. The Plan is terminated IF YOU LEAVE THE COMPANY Upon termination you may stop making contributions and discontinue participation in the Cafeteria Plan. Only eligible expenses incurred before termination may be submitted during the year and until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year. If you return to service during the same Plan Year and elect to participate in the Plan, your former elections will be reinstated after prorating for the period you were not employed by a Participating Employer. If you return to service within 30 days of termination, you are required to resume participation at the same election in effect when you terminated. An alternative for the terminating participant is to continue making after -tax contributions for the Health Care Expense Reimbursement account, incurring eligible expenses for the remainder of the year, and submitting claims (until July 1) for services incurred during the Plan Year. You may continue to submit claims (until July 1) for eligible expenses incurred during the remainder of the year for the balance of your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account without making additional contributions. IF YOU DIE A beneficiary may file claims for eligible expenses incurred while you participated in the Cafeteria Plan (before your death). Your beneficiary must submit such claims by July 1 following the end of the Plan Year in which you were participating. FEDERAL RULES THAT APPLY TO REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTS Reimbursement accounts take advantage of federal laws that allow you to pay eligible health care and dependent care expenses with pretax dollars --that is, with money that has not been taxed. Since reimbursement accounts provide tax advantages, the IRS imposes certain restrictions on their use. The IRS requires that you use the money in your reim bursement accounts for expenses you incur during the Plan Year (or during the grace period if applicable) in which you are participating. The Plan Year ends on December 31; however, you have until July 1 of the 7 following year to request reimbursement for expenses incurred during the year. If you do not claim all of the money in your account by that date, the balance is forfeited. If you enroll in both reimbursement accounts, you may not transfer balances from one account to the other. Your Health Care E xpense Reimbursement Account balance remains totally separate from your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance. Once you enroll, you may not stop your payroll deductions or change the amount you contribute during the year unless you have a qu alifying election change event. You have 31 days from the date of the qualifying election change event to change your election. All election changes that you make are prospectively effective from the date the election change is made except in the case of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, for which election changes made within 30 days are effective the date of the event. This means that if you add a new dependent or spouse for reasons other than birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, only ex penses incurred after the date of the qualifying election change event are reimbursable under the Plan for the new dependent or spouse. For example, if you get married on June 1 and make an election to increase your Health Care Spending Account contributi on on June 15, only expenses incurred by your new spouse (and any other newly acquired dependents as a result of the marriage) on or after June 15 are reimbursable under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any expenses incurred by your spouse (or other newly acquired dependents) before June 15 will not be reimbursed under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT The Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account allows you to set aside pretax dollars, t hrough payroll deductions, to pay for qualifying health care expenses not reimbursed by any other health plan. As you or your spouse and qualifying dependents incur eligible health care expenses, you request reimbursement from your Health Care Expense Rei mbursement Account in tax -free dollars. For purposes of the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, qualifying dependents are defined by IRC \u00a7105(b) . Generally, this includes your legal spouse (as defined under federal law), your child(ren) and any qualifying relatives . Your child(ren) includes your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child or legally adopted child, regardless of such child's tax dependent status, marital status, employment status, student status or residency . Your child(ren) is eligible for coverage under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account until the end of the year in which he or she attains age 26. Other qualifying relatives may also be eligible. (See QUALIFYING RELATIVE section for a list of individuals who may be qualifying dependents.) CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT When you enroll in a Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, you choose how much you want deducted annually from your pay and redirected pretax into the account in your name. Y ou may elect to contribute up to $2, 600 per year to your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. The amount you choose is divided by the number of pay periods in the year and deducted on an equal pretax basis from each of your paychecks throughout the year. If your paycheck is less than the amount elected, you must pay any balance due by the first of the next month. Because of IRS rules, it is important to estimate your annual health care expenses carefully when determining the amount you wish to redi rect into your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Amounts not used for eligible expenses incurred during the coverage period, usually the Plan Year, are forfeited. (See the exception to this rule for QUALIFIED RESERVIST DISTRIBUTIONS, below .) 8 ELIG IBLE EXPENSES Most health care expenses not reimbursed by your or your spouse's medical, dental or vision plans can be reimbursed through your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, provided the service/item is received during the coverage period in which you are participating. (Payment date does NOT determine if or when the Plan may reimburse you for the expense.) You can be reimbursed for medical expenses incurred for you, your spouse or others claimed as dependents on your federal income tax return . IRS Code \u00a7213(d)(1) defines medical care as diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body. An expense which is merely beneficial to the general health of an indivi dual is NOT considered an expense for medical care. Eligible medical expenses include, but are not limited to: Deductibles Co-payments under medical, dental and vision plans Orthodontia-- Refer to flier detailing orthodontia reimbursement (available on Con nect) Mental health services in excess of health plan benefits Charges in excess of established usual and customary amounts, as determined under Company medical and dental plans Otherwise unreimbursed dental services (not cosmetic) Medical equipment Chirop ractic services, if to treat a specific medical condition Physical therapy Prescription drugs (qualifying drug or biological that legally requires physician's prescription Over-the-counter drugs and medicines if prescribed by a physician Smoking cessation programs and prescription drugs Insulin Podiatrist fees Support or corrective devices that are necessary for daily living Acupuncture fees Eye exams, eyeglasses, and contact lenses (not covered by a vision care program) Hearing exams and aids Meals, lodgin g and mileage while away from home for medical treatment (see below on how to file) Fees related to a weight -loss program. Cost of diet foods is not covered. (A copy of the physician prescription must accompany the ledger.) IMPORTANT: Effective January 1, 2011, federal law no longer allows expenses for over -the- counter drugs and medicines to be reimbursed from the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account unless prescribed by a physician. Eligible expenses must be incurred on or after your effective date of participation and must be substantiated by the provider of services. Generally, this means you must provide a third -party 9 receipt that shows: 1. The medical treatment, item or device received; 2. The date the expense was incurred; and 3. The amount of the expense. MEALS, LODGING, AND MILEAGE Expenses for transportation and related travel are reimbursable when you obtain medical care for yourself, your spouse, or a qualifying dependent at a location greater than 100 miles from your employing locati on. The travel expenses must be primarily for and essential to medical care. No significant element of personal pleasure, recreation or vacation may be contained in the travel expenses. (See QUAILIFYING RELATIVE section for a list of individuals who may be qualifying dependents.) You must submit substantiating documentation along with your reimbursement request in order for transportation and related travel to be considered an eligible medical expense. Such documentation must include: A letter from the referring physician indicating the name and location of the referred licensed healthcare facility and the name of the attending physician at that location. Original receipts for lodging, meals, public transportation (plane, train, etc .), and local transpo rtation (rental car, public transit, etc.) and fuel. If you use a vehicle other than a rental car, you must provide a contemporaneous mileage log showing the dates of travel, the travel origination and destination points, and the starting and ending odo meter readings of the vehicle you use. IRS limits the amount of travel costs for medical expense purposes to the following: Meals - only those eaten while en route to and from the medical treatment site Lodging - $50 per person per day Mileage - Rate as published by the Internal Revenue Service Persons covered - patient and one attendant if required for medical reasons Your reimbursement cannot exceed the amount of your annual salary redirection election for the Healthcare Expense Reimbursement Acc ount. EXPENSES NOT ELIGIBLE Examples of health care expenses that are not reimbursable by your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account include but are not limited to: Over -the-counter drugs and medicines that are not prescribed by a physician Health plan contributions Any expense reimbursed by a health, dental or vision plan Cosmetic surgery, unless medically necessary Marriage or family counseling Funeral or burial expenses 10 Household or domestic help, even if advised by your doctor Custodial care Massage therapy for general health Any expense incurred in connection with an illegal operation or treatment Health club fees Cosmetics, toiletries, toothpaste, slippers and other personal care items (e.g. shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, etc.) Medical expenses you itemize or for which you take a tax credit on your federal income tax return HOW YOU ARE REIMBURSED To request reimbursement for an eligible expense, submit electronically via MyFlexOnline, MyFlexM obile application, or a completed Expense Claim Form to Benefits Administration, PO Box 619031, Roseville, CA 95661- 9031. You must furnish documents such as itemized bills/invoices or computer printouts, or health plan Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for all expenses claimed. Payment of covered claims will be made to you by direct deposit or check up to the contribution amount you elected. You will only be reimbursed for eligible health expenses for which you have actually received service. No claims will be paid before the services are provided. Claims will b e processed every Tuesday and Thursday on a weekly basis. Claims must be in the Friday prior. If your claim is denied, you may file an appeal (see APPEAL OF DENIED CLAIMS section below). YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE You will receive periodic statements of your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance during the year. Review these statements carefully to help ensure that you use all of your contributions by year -end. REIMBURSEMENT DEADLINE You have until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year to subm it your reimbursement requests for the current Plan Year. Eligible health expenses include only those amounts for services/items received during the coverage period usually the Plan Year and the grace period discussed below, in which you participate in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any balance remaining after July 1 is forfeited. A \"grace period\" follows the end of the Plan Year for the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account for amounts you have allocated to your account that are unus ed at the end of the Plan Year. These amounts may be used to reimburse eligible health expenses incurred during the grace period. The grace period will begin on the first day of the subsequent Plan Year, January 1, and end on March 15. In order to take advantage of the grace period, you must be participating in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the last day of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates. For example, if the Plan Year ends December 31, 2018 , the grace period begins January 1, 2019 and ends March 15, 2019 . The following additional rules apply to the grace period: Eligible health expenses incurred during the grace period and approved for reimbursement will be paid first from amounts that were remaining at the end of the Plan Year to which the grace 11 period relates and then from any amounts that are available to reimburse expenses incurred during the current Plan Year. Remember, you may not use Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account amounts to reimburse health expenses. QUALIFIED RESERVIST DISTRIBUTION You may be able to receive a taxable distribution of amounts allocated to the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account that are unused in the event you are called to active duty if you meet the following criteria: You are a member of a \"reserve component\" (as defined in section 101 of title 37 of the United States Code), which means a member of the Army National Guard; the Reserve for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force or Coast Guard; Air National Guard of the United States; or the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service; You are called or ordered to active military duty for (i) 180 days or more or (ii) for an indefinite period; You provide a copy of your order or call to active duty; and You are a p articip ant in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the date you are called or ordered to duty. If you believe you are eligible for a Qualified Reservist Distribution, you must contact the Administrator of the Plan to request a distribution request fo rm as soon as possible. A request for a Qualified Reservist Distribution must be made in writing on the form provided by the Administrator of the Plan. You must submit a copy of your order or call to active duty along with your request. Requests for a Qualified Reservist Distribution must be made on or after the date of the order or call to duty but before the last day of the Plan Year (or grace period, if applicable) during which the order or call to duty occurred. You will receive your Qualified Reserv ist Distribution within a reasonable period of time, but no later than sixty (60) days after your request has been received. A Qualified Reservist Distribution will be made based on all salary reduction amounts credited to your Health Care Expense Reimbur sement Account for the applicable Plan Year that have not been applied to provide reimbursements submitted before the Qualified Reservist Distribution request is submitted. Claims incurred and submitted but not yet reimbursed at the time the Qualified Reservist Distribution Request is received will be treated like any other claim submitted for reimbursement under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account . The Administrator of the Plan will determine what this amount is on a uniform basis, consistent w ith applicabl e law and IRS interpretations. Unlike your reimbursements from your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account for eligible health expenses , the amount of your Qualified Reservist Distribution is taxed as income and will be reported as income on your W -2. Qualified Reservist Distributions do not apply to amounts in your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account . 12 DEPENDENT CARE EXPEN SE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT The Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account allows you to set aside pretax dollars , through payroll deductions, to pay for qualifying dependent care expenses. These expenses can include care for your children, disabled spouse or other qualifying dependent as defined in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \u00a7152. (See \"Qualifying Individual\" bel ow.) As you incur eligible dependent care expenses, you request reimbursement in tax -free dollars. NOTE: Dependent care expenses are eligible for reimbursement through your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account if they are necessary to enable you to be gainfully employed (you and your spouse if you are married). If your spouse is not employed, dependent care expenses will not be eligible, unless your spouse is a full -time student or is physically or mentally incapable of self -care. Additionally , if you are divorced or legally separated, you must be the custodial parent and need childcare in order for you to work. The IRS states that you must make the determination as to whether you are gainfully employed or in active search of gainful employment on a daily basis. Payments you make under a caregiver arrangement that requires you to pay for care during short, temporary absences will be qualified employment -related expenses. The IRS has established a period of two consecutive weeks or less as a safe harbor for short, temporary absences. The Administrator of the Plan may determine that longer periods of absence are short, temporary absences based on your facts and circumstances. In no situation will absences of 12 weeks under FMLA be deemed shor t, temporary absences. Part -time employees who are required to pay for care on a periodic basis, such as weekly or monthly, will be able to claim those payments as qualified employment -related expenses. CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSE REIMBURS EMENT ACCOUNT When you enroll in a Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account, you choose how much you want deducted annually from your pay and redirected into the account in your name. You may elect to contribute up to $5,000 per year. (If you are mar ried and filing separately, you may contribute up to $2,500 per year. See \"Limitations on Your Contributions\" below.) The amount you choose will be divided by the number of pay periods in the year and deducted on an equal pretax basis from each of your paychecks throughout the year. If your paycheck is less than the amount elected, you must pay any balance due by the first of the next month. Because of IRS rules, it is important to estimate your annual dependent care expenses carefully when determining the amount you choose to redirect into your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Amounts not used for qualifying dependent care during your coverage period are forfeited. LIMITATIONS ON YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS Your contributions to the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account cannot exceed the lesser of your annual earned income or that of your spouse. If your spouse is a full -time student or incapable of self -care, your spouse's monthly income will be considered to be $250 per month if you have one dependent or $500 per month for two or more dependents. 13 QUALIFYING INDIVIDUAL Must share the same principal place of abode with you for more than half the taxable year . An individual age 12 or under who is your \"qualifying child\" as defined in IRC \u00a7152(c). In general, a \"qualifying child\" is your child (including a brother, sister, step sibling) or a descendant of your child (e.g. a niece, nephew, grandchild) who does not provide over half of his or her own support A spouse who is physically or mentall y incapable of self -care A qualifying relative, as defined in IRC \u00a7 152, without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B), who is physically or mentally incapable of self -care and for whom you provide more than one- half of the individual's suppor t and is not your or another individual's qualifying child for the calendar year QUALIFYING RELATIVE Within the meaning of IRC \u00a7152(d), the following individuals qualify as dependents: 1. Son or daughter, biological or adopted, or stepson or stepdaughter o f the taxpayer, or a descendant of either, or an eligible foster child 2. Brother, sister, stepbrother or stepsister of the taxpayer 3. Father or mother of the taxpayer or an ancestor of either 4. Stepfather or stepmother of the taxpayer 5. A son or daught er of a brother or sister of the taxpayer 6. Brother or sister of the father or mother of the taxpayer 7. Son-in-law, daughter -in-law, father -in-law, mother -in-law, brother -in-law or sister -in-law of the taxpayer 8.

WHO may PROVIDE services: A relative may provide dependent care services as long as he or she is not a dependent for whom you claim a deduction. Services may not be provided by: Your spouse or dependent Your spouse's dependent Your child under the age of 19 at the close of the calendar year The parent of your qualifying child; e.g. the noncustodial parent 14 WHERE services may be performed: In your home Outside your home - For the care of your dependent age 12 or under - For a Qualifying Individual who regularly spends at least eight ( 8) hours a day in your home ELIGIBLE EXPENSES include, but are not limited to, char ges from: A licensed child care center A nursery school In-home care for a child/spouse unable to care for him/her self Daytime summer camp (not educational) An adult day care center An adult private sitter, nanny or home care companion EXPENSES NOT ELIGIB LE Examples of dependent care expenses that are not reimbursable by your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account, as defined by the IRS, include, but are not limited to: Nursing home charges Kindergarten fees Schooling fees for children in the first grade and up Tuition Food, clothing, or transportation expenses Overnight camp Payments to a dependent you claim as an exemption for federal income tax purposes Expenses you deduct or for which you take a tax credit on your federal income tax return Presc hool fees when separate from childcare HOW YOU ARE REIMBURSED To request reimbursement from your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account for an eligible expense, submit electronically via MyFlexOnline, MyFlexMobile application, or submit a completed E xpense Claim Form to Benefits Administration, PO Box 619031, Roseville, CA 95661- 9031. The following information must be on file and/or provided with your claim: 1. Dependents for who services were performed 2. Amount of requested reimbursement 3. Relation ship, if any, of the service provider to you - If services were performed by one of your children, the age of such child 15 4. Place and date where services were performed - If outside your home, does the dependent receiving such services spend at least eig ht (8) hours per day in your home - If at a Dependent Care Center [as defined in IRC \u00a721(b)(2)] , does the center provide dependent care for more than six (6) individuals on a nonresident basis 5. If you are married, provide a statement as to: - The amount of your spouse's earned income if less than $5,000 per calendar year - If your spouse is not employed, is - Spouse incapable of self -care - Spouse a full -time student attending classes at least five ( 5) months per calendar year Payment of covered claims will be made directly to you by direct deposit or check, up to the annual contribution amount you elected, but not to exceed the amount you have contributed to date. You will only be reimbursed for eligible dependent care expenses that have actually been incurred during your coverage period. No claims will be paid before the services are provided . The date you pay for your dependent care services DOES NOT determine when or if the Plan may reimburse you. If your claim is denied, you may file an appeal (A PPEAL OF DENIED CLAIMS section below). YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE You will receive periodic statements of your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance during the year. Review these statements carefully to help ensure that you use all of your contri butions by year -end. REIMBURSEMENT DEADLINE You have until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year to submit your reimbursement requests for the Plan Year. Eligible dependent care expenses include only those amounts for services received during the coverage period, usually the Plan Year and the grace period discussed below, in which you actively participate in the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any balance remaining after July 1 is forfeited. A \"grace period\" follows the end of the Plan Year for the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account for amounts you have allocated to your account that are unused at the end of the Plan Year. These amounts may be used to reimburse eligible dependent care expenses incurred during the grace period. The grace period will begin on the first day of the subsequent Plan Year, January 1, and end on March 15. In order to take advantage of the grace period, you must be participating in the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the last day of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates. For example, if the Plan Year ends December 31, 2018, the gra ce period begins January 1, 2019 and ends March 15, 2019 . The following additional rules apply to the grace period: Eligible dependent care expenses incurred during the grace period and approved for reimbursement will be paid first from amounts that were remaining at the end of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates and then from any amounts that are available to reimburse 16 expenses incurred during the current Plan Year. Remember, you may not use Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account amounts to reimburse dependent care expenses. AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO SAVE TAXES Using the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account is just one way you can receive a tax break for eligible dependent care expenses. The federal government also allows a tax credit called the household and dependent care credit for eligible dependent care expenses when you file your income tax return. The household and dependent care tax credit is an allowance for a percentage of your annual day care expenses as a credit against your federal income tax liability under the U.S. Tax Code. In determining what the tax credit would be, you may take into account only $2 ,400 of such expenses for one eligible dependent or $4 ,800 for two or more dependents. Depending on your adjusted gross income, the percentage could be as much as 35% of your eligible day care expenses to a maximum credit amount of $1,050 for one dependent or $2,100 for two or more dependents (to a minimum of 20% of eligible day care expenses). The maximum 35% must be reduced by 1% (but not below 20%) for each $2,000 portion (or any fraction of $2,000) of your adjusted gross income over $15,000. Tax credit limits may ch ange in future years. Visit the web site for the Internal Revenue Service at www.irs.gov for updates. You can use both the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account and the federal tax credit, provided you do not claim the same expenses for both. You s hould consult a personal financial or tax advisor to help you decide whether the tax credit or the Dependent Care Spending Account is more favorable for you. Note: The amounts that may be used to calculate the tax credit are reduced dollar for dollar by amounts reimbursed under the Dependent Care Spending Account. See IRS Publication 503 for a complete discussion of the tax credit. 17 APPEAL OF DENIED CLA IMS The following appeal procedures apply only to the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account and Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account .

Patient safety is the cornerst one of high quality care. Ensur ing patient safety requires a culture of safety where the organization avoids assigning blame to individuals. C reating a culture of safety begins by building awareness. Mis takes are often the result of multiple f actors, not simply one individuals misstep. It is the philosophy of this org anization that safety is everyo nes responsibility and th erefore, must be a collaborative effort . 2. Strong organization leadership is vital in developing and mai ntaining a culture of safety. Such a culture encourages the internal reporting of medical errors and activel y engages clinicians and other staff in the design of remedial steps to pre vent future occur rences of these errors. A second major focus of a strong safety culture is on the p revention of medical errors th rough the prospective analysis and redesign of vulnerable patient care systems. Lastly, healthcare organizations must understand the importance of communicating with patients and families when una nticipated outcomes occur. 3. Encouraging the reporting of med ical errors is critical to th e success of any patient safety effort. Reporting errors serves to: 1. Hold leaders accountable for performance and patient safety. 2. Provide information that lea ds to improved patient safety. 4. Accountability is necessary to ensure t he provision of adequa te resources and support and facilitates a safety conscious culture that s tarts with senior management and pervades front line care providers. Information rela ted to medical errors will enhance k nowledge ab out the causes of errors and their prevention. 5. The purpose of this policy is to describe the underlying syst ems and proce sses utilized in the prevention of event triggers, detection of e rror precursors , and the corre ction of err or causes. DEFINITIONS: 1. Adverse Event- An injury result ing from a medical interventio n, or in other words, is not due to the underlying patient condition. 2. Medical Error-Failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or the use o f a wrong plan to achieve this aim.Page 1 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/c gi/doc-gw.pl?ref=ahhmh:1100 53. Sentinel Event-An unexpected o ccurrence involving death or se rious physical or psyc hological injury, or the risk thereof. Serious injury specifically includes loss of limb or function. The phrase or the risk thereof includes any process vari ation for which a recurrence w ould carry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. 4. Unanticipated Outcome-A resul t that differs significantly fro m what was anticipated to be the result of a treatment or procedure. 5. Patient Safety Practice-A type of process or structure whose application r educes the probability of adverse events resulting from ex posure to the health care syste m across a range of diseases and procedures. AFFECTED DEPART MENTS/SERVICES: All departments. POLICY: COMPLIANCE - KEY ELEMENTS A. Promoting a Safety -Conscious Culture 1. In order to improve patient safety and reduce errors, an envi ronment must be created and maintained in which we can learn from failure - a safe, non-pun itive environment that supports candid discussion of errors, thei r causes, and ways to prevent them. This requires the leadership and commitment of sen ior executives, medical, nursin g, and clinical staff to create change within our organization. This requires a \"Culture of Saf ety\" so that the likelihood of human error is minimized. 2. Framework a. Effective leadership is necess ary to facilitat e significant s afety improvements and promote safety aware ness. Senior leadersh ip will be active in l eading patient safety improvements. b. This organization advocates a c onceptual framework that suppo rts systemic change. Change will be far more productive in reduci ng medical errors t han will targ eting and punishing individual providers. c. Perfecting the practices of individual doctors, nurses, or ph armacists cannot prevent most medical errors. Improving pa tient safety involves the coor dinated efforts of multiple members of the health care team. This focus on process es and systems rather than individuals is a vit al and necessary step in the id entification and prevention of medical errors. d. The risks associated with hosp italization are significant and the strategies for improvement in patient care are based on the trusting relations hip established between the patient and caregiver as we ll as the trust and respect deve loped between caregivers and hospital leaders. 3. Culture Change a. Culture is defined by how sta ff works together in ongoing eff orts to provide patient care. Four cultural traits comm on in the health care industry m ake reducing or preventing medical errors difficult: i. Fear: Staff afraid of losing their jobPage 2 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/c gi/doc-gw.pl?ref=ahhmh:1100 5ii. Shame: Personal failure and p rofessional pride may lead a st aff member to feel that a good physician or nurse does not harm patients iii. Urgency: Staff may t ake shortcuts and by pass routine system s in an effort to act as quickly as possible iv. Arrogance: Labeling rules an d regulations as bureaucracy b. To adopt a safety conscious cul ture that is bas ed on a non-pu nitive approach to reporting medical errors, the fi ve elements of human performanc e will be considered in an effort to identify barri ers and dispel myths: i. All people make errors ii. Error-prone situations are predictable, manageable, and prev entable iii. Individual behavior is stron gly influenced by organizationa l, programmatic, and management performance iv. High levels of human performanc e can be achieved if right be haviors are taught, encouraged, and reinforced v. Undesirable events can be avoi ded by understanding and monito ring precursor conditions and applyi ng lessons learned from past and significant events c. Leaders are educated regarding error management and committed to the goal of medical error reduction and, wher e possible, elimination. Build ing a clear leadership consensus for change is a top pri ority and fostering a patient safety climate a prevalent management theme. Hospital leaders promote patient safety aware ness by: i. Demonstrating patient safety as a top leadership priority, al locating adequate resources and strategic support , including information systems and data management processes, for measuri ng, assessing, and improving p atient safety; providing adequate personnel to participate in patient safety activities ii. Ensuring patient safety is interdisciplinary and coordinated and integrated throughout the organization iii. Promoting a non-punitive cul ture for sharing information an d lessons learned iv. Conducting routine organizat ion-wide assessments of the risk of error and adverse events in the care deliv ery process; all appropriate de partments and services will be included in th is assessment v. Evaluating external best prac tices related to clinical care vi. Analyzing adverse events and variations in performance or processes that affect patient safety and identifying trends across events vii. Providing recognition for re porting errors and safety-drive n decision making viii. Considering information rela ted to patient s afety and unan ticipated outcomes in process planning for performance improvement priorities including the design or redesign of processes, functions or services ix. Implementing care d elivery process improvements which includ e minimal steps and handoffs, thereby avoiding reliance on memory x. Engaging patients and families in providing feedback related to safety concerns including the patients role in hel ping to facilitate t he safe delivery of Page 3 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/c gi/doc-gw.pl?ref=ahhmh:1100 5care and the patients/familys re perc eived risk to their care xi. Measuring the effectiveness of leaderships contributions to improving patient safety B. Error Management 1. Vulnerable Patient Care Areas , Systems, and Safety Practices a. Ongoing monitoring related to patient safety processes will i nclude the following high- risk areas/systems/practices: i. Physical hospital environment ii. Inpatient care areas iii. Infection cont rol practices iv. Medication practices v. Surgery vi. Anesthesia vii. Transfusion practices viii. Staffing cov erage and compet ency related to patient safety 2. Approach to Medical Error Management a. Addressing medical errors involves the following steps: i. Prevention of e vent triggers I. The goal of medical error management is to eliminate, substan tially reduce, or prevent future o ccurrence of medical errors II. Education of staff at all leve ls related to err or prevention techniques is essential III. Establishing an accountability system w ill instill behavior consistent with goal of medical error management ii. Detection of error precursors I. Hospital leaders will oversee ac tivities related to performan ce trending, performance monitori ng, and actions taken to change performance II. The information contained in Sentinel Event Alerts will be w idely communicated and discussed with consideration given to implementation of recommendations. III. The hospital will adopt National Pat ient Safety Goals recommendations, or submit alterna te plans for compliance to th e Joint Commission. IV. Prospective analysis and redes ign of vulnerable patient care systems will occur as appropria te; a proactive risk assessment of one h igh-risk patient safety proce ss will be done annuallyPage 4 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/c gi/doc-gw.pl?ref=ahhmh:1100 5V. Prompt reporting of medical er rors will be encou raged; a medi cal error reporting system will be utilized as the mechanism for communic ation and reporting of events; this inc ludes no harm occurrences as w ell as unanticipated outcomes and sentinel events VI. Immediate response to a medic al error will include care of t he affected person(s), containment of risk to others, and preserva tion of factual information for subsequ ent analysis; s upport will be pr ovided to staff members VII. Sentinel events w ill be managed a ccording to hospital polic y iii. Correction of error will invo lve utilizing root cause analy sis to determine human, organizational, and progr am failures and identify manage ment issues. I. Measurement and analysis of critical steps in at least one ac tual process identified as error-prone high-ris k will be done to det ermine the degree of variation f rom intended performance b. Because of the need to conside r the effect the medical error has on the patients medical condition, further treatm ent, and current hospitalizati on, the attending physician, or consulting physician in certain situations, is of ten better suited for discussing unanticipated outcomes with the patient, family or l egally authorized representative. Even in situations in which a hospital employee has committed the error, the physician is usually b etter suited to respond to que stions from the patient and family. C. Communication/Reporting of P atient Safety Activities 1. Hospital leadership will oversee patient s afety activities. L eadership may include medical staff, hospital Safety Officer, Risk M anager, Quality Manager, Pharmac y Director, and Infection Control Nurse as appropriate. Other managers may be included wh en appropriate. 2. B. Patient safety activities a nd outcomes will be reported to the Quality Council, Medical Executive Committee, and Governing Board.

We expect everyone in the org anization with supervisory responsibility to exercise that responsibility in a kind, sensitive, thoughtful, and respectful manner. We also expec t that leaders will ensure thei r teams have sufficient information to comply with laws, regulations, and policies, as well as the resources to resolve ethical dilemmas. Leaders must help to support a culture within SHNV that promotes the highest standards of conduct, ethics and complianc e. This culture must encourage everyone in the organization to share concerns immedi ately. We must never sacrifice ethical and compliant behavior in the pursuit of busi ness objectives. Our Responsibility to Our Patients Quality of Care and Patient Safety We are committed to the delivery of safe, effective, efficient, compassionate and satisfying patient care. We treat all patients with warmth, respect and di gnity and provide care that is both necessary and appropriate. We ensure that the SHNV Staff pr ovide appropriate, quality patient care by: xIndividualizing care for each patient with care plans that docu ment the reason(s) for the level of care, goals and objectives, interventions and part icipation by appropriate professionals, and which are reviewed and revised a ccording to each patient's needs. Clinical decision making is never based on fi nancial class of patients, ability to pay, or referrals. xEnsuring we never discontinue necessary patient treatment, or p rovide unnecessary patient care for financial reasons. xUsing adequate numbers of appropriately trained staff to implem ent each patient's care plan. xEstablishing a system that incorporates the use of best practic es or established standards. SHNV uses generally accepted indicators that help us to measure the quality of care provided. Agencies that have developed these in dicators include, for example, the Conditions of Participation of the Centers for Med icare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the standards and surveys of The Joint Comm ission. xSupporting our Medical Staff in monitoring quality, utilization of resources and the appropriateness of care plans. xProviding SHNV Staff with adequate resources to do their work. xEvaluating technological advancements occurring in the marketpl ace and allocating resources for the purchase of appropriate medical and other rel ated equipment to ensure quality and patient safety and to create an overall cult ure that makes patient safety paramount. xSustaining a culture that encourages questions about whether th e quality or patient safety commitments set forth in this Code of Conduct are being fully met and that requires individuals to raise concerns through appropriate chan nels until a concern or question has been addressed and resolved. Additionally, pati ents, SHNV Staff and physicians with a concern about the safety and quality of c are provided at SHNV may report these concerns to The Joint Commission or the SH NV Patient Safety Hotline as follows: 07/22/2013 3 This commitment to quality and patient safety is an obligation o f e v e r y S H N V S t a f f member. Patient Rights We ensure appropriate care for all patients. We make no distinc tion in the availability of services; the admission, transfer or discharge of a patient; or in the care we provide based on age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, race, color, re ligion, national origin, and ability to pay or type of insurance. We recognize and respect t he diverse backgrounds and cultures of our patients and make every effort to equip our car egivers with the knowledge and resources to respect each patient's cultural heritage and n eeds. We are mindful that our community is becoming more diverse. Accordingly, we educate our staff to ensure they are equipped to meet our patient's needs in a culturally sensitiv e manner. We develop and implement policies and procedures to protect patient rights in the delivery of patient care. These policies and procedures are located in administrative or patient care manuals which include patient rights, informed consent, advance directives, g rievance management, withholding and withdrawing of life support and pastoral counse l i n g . W e s u p p o r t a n d facilitate patients' rights to access guardianship, advocacy, c onservatorship, child and/or adult protective services by providing information as requested a n d r e f e r r a l s . ( S e e : Abuse/Neglect: Reporting and Identification of Suspected Child Abuse, Elder and/or Dependent Adult Abuse, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Pol icy). The Social Work Services Department is responsible for ensuring that the proper protective agencies are notified as required by county, state and federal laws (See: A ttachments). Each patient is provided with a written statement of patient rights and a notic e of privacy practices.

Email: complaint@jointcommission.org 07/22/2013 4We are committed to ensuring confidentiality of records and rel ated information for all patients. Consistent with HIPAA, we do not use, disclose or dis cuss patient-specific information, including patient financial information, with othe rs unless it is necessary to serve the patient or required by law. SHNV Staff must never use or disclose confidential information th at violates the privacy rights of our patients. In accordance with our privacy and secu rity policies and procedures, which reflect HIPAA requirements, no SHNV Staff has a right to an y patient information other than that necessary to perform his or her job or responsib ilities. Any breach of confidentiality represents a failure to meet the professional a nd ethical standards expected, and constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct. A full confidentiality statement is received and accepted by each employee as part of the Employee Handbook . We also expect our vendors involved in patient care to perform and provide services consistent with the applicable HIPAA laws. We include HIPAA Busi ness Associate language in our agreements with these vendors. Emergency Treatment We follow the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) in providing an emergency medical screening examination and necessary stabil ization to all patients, regardless of ability to pay. Provided we have the capacity and capability, anyone with an emergency medical condition is treated. In an emergency situati on or if the patient is in labor, we will not delay the medical screening and necessary st abilization treatment in order to seek financial and demographic information. We do not admit, discharge, or transfer a patient with an emergency medical condition simply b ased on their ability or inability to pay or any other discriminatory factor. A patient with an emergency medical condition is only transferre d to another facility at the patient's request or if the patient's medical needs cannot be m et at SHNV and appropriate care is knowingly available at another facility. Patients are on ly transferred in strict compliance with state and federal EMTALA regulatory and statuto ry requirements. Our Responsibilities to and with our Physicians Healthcare services like those owned and operated by SHNV are a c ollaboration between SHNV Staff and SHNV Medical Staff members. As in any collaboration, each party has important roles and responsibilities. SHNV is committed to provid ing an excellent work environment for SHNV Medical Staff. SHNV Staff interacts with SHNV Me dical Staff members in a respectful and supporting way. We require SHNV Medi cal Staff members to be familiar with this Code of Conduct. SHNV Medical Staff are gove rned by Medical Staff Rules and Regulations. a. Interactions with Physicians: Federal and state laws and regulations govern the relationship between hospitals and physicians who may refer patients to SHNV. The applicable feder al laws include the Anti-Kickback Law and the Stark Law. It is important that SHNV S taff who interact with physicians (particularly those SHNV Staff who make payments to ph ysicians for services rendered, provide space or services to physicians, rec ruit physicians to the community, and/or arrange for physicians to serve in leadership positions in the 07/22/2013 5organization) are aware of the requirements of the laws, regula tions, and policies that address relationships between SHNV and physicians. If relationsh ips with physicians are properly structured, but not diligently administered, such failure to administer the arrangements as agreed results in a violation of the law. Any arr angement with a physician must be structured to ensure compliance with legal re quirements. Most arrangements must be in writing and approved by the Compliance Department. Failure to meet all requirements of these laws and regulations can resu lt in serious consequences for SHNV. b. We do not pay for referrals . We accept patient referral and admissions based solely on the p atient's medical needs and our ability to render the needed services. We do not pay or offer to pay anyone - staff, physicians, or other persons or entities - for the referra l of patients. c. We do not accept payments for referrals we make. No SHNV Staff member or any other person acting on behalf of SHNV , is permitted to solicit or receive anything of value, directly or indirectly, i n exchange for the referral of patients. Similarly, when making patient referrals to another h ealthcare provider, we do not take into account the volume or value of referrals that the provider has made to AH. d. We do not Extend Business Cour tesies and/or Tokens of Appreci ation to Potential Referral Sources, Outside of the SHNV Policies . Any entertainment, gift or token of appreciation involving phys icians or other persons who are in a position to refer patients to SHNV must be undertake n in accordance with SHNV policies. These policies were developed to be in complianc e with federal laws, regulations, and rules regarding these practices. SHNV Staff must consult SHNV policies or our Compliance Department prior to extending any bu siness courtesy or token of appreciation to a potential referral source. Our Responsibilities to Ensure Legal and Regulatory Compliance SHNV provides many types of healthcare services. These services are provided pursuant to appropriate federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and federal conditions of participation. Such laws, regulations, and conditions of partic ipation may include, but are not limited to, subjects such as certificates of need, licenses , permits, accreditations, access to treatment, consent to treatment, medical record-keepi ng, access to medical records and confidentiality, patients' rights, clinical researc h, end of life care decision making, and Medicare and Medicaid program requirements. The org anization is subject to other numerous laws in addition to these healthcare laws, regula tions, and the conditions of participation. SHNV has developed policies and procedures to address many legal , accreditation, certification and regulatory requirements. However, it is impra ctical to develop policies and procedures that encompass the full body of applicable law, stan dards, conditions and regulations. Such laws, standards, conditions and regulations no t covered in organizational policies and procedures must still be followed. There is a rang e of expertise within SHNV, including operations counsel and numerous functional experts, w ho should be consulted 07/22/2013 6for advice concerning human resources, legal regulations and st atutes, established standards and applicable conditions of participation. Anyone aware of violations or suspected violations of laws, reg ulations, standards and the conditions of participation, or SHNV policies and procedures must report them immediately. There are many individuals to whom SHNV Staff may v oice such concerns including supervisors, any member of the SHNV Leadership Team, the Vice President of Human Resources, the Compliance Officer, the Compliance Departm ent, the Adventist Health Compliance Officer or Compliance hotline. Accreditation and Surveys From time to time, government agencies and other entities conduct surveys at SHNV. Accreditation or external agency surveys are extremely signific ant and broader than the scope of this Code of Conduct. In preparation for, during and after surveys, SHNV Staff must comply with all accrediting and external agency surveyors in a direct, open and honest manner and with accurate information. In preparation for, or during a survey or inspection, SHNV Staff must never conceal, destroy, or alter any documents, lie; or make misleading statem ents to the agency representative. Also, SHNV Staff must never attempt to cause anot her staff member to fail to provide accurate information or obstruct, mislead, or delay the communication of information or records relating to a possible violation of law. No action should ever be taken, directly or indirectly, to mislead the accrediting or ex ternal agency survey teams. Federal and State False Claims Acts Federal and State False Claims Acts prohibit any person or enti ty from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a fals e or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, or knowingly making or using, or causing to made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved. The penalties for violating the Federal or State False Claims A ct include: xCivil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each false claim submitted; xUp to three times the amount of damages the government sustain s because of the false claim; and, xThe costs of the legal action brought to recover for the false c laim. A private citizen may file suit under the Federal and State Fal se Claims Acts on behalf of the government if the citizen has direct and independent knowled ge of the submission of a false claim. The government will then decide whether to interve ne and take over the case, dismiss or settle the case, or let the private individual pursu e the case on his or her own. In either case, the person who initially filed the case may receiv e a portion of the amount recovered in either litigation or settlement of the claim. Whistleblower Protections Both the Federal and State False Claims Acts prohibit employers from retaliating or discriminating against an employee who, acting in good faith, i nvestigates, reports or assists in uncovering a false claim or statement. 07/22/2013 7An employee who suffers discrimination or retaliation based on protected activities has the right to sue under the both the Federal and State False Claims Act. If the employee can prove that his or her employer retaliated against him or her for engaging in protected activity, the employee is entitled to be \"made whole.\" The reme dies may include: xReinstatement of the employee to his or her position; xTwo times the amount of back pay; xInterest on the back pay; and, xCompensation for any special damages (including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees). As noted above, it is the policy of Adventist Health and its Af filiates that no employee shall be punished solely on the basis that he or she reported what he or she reasonably believed to be an act of wrongdoing or a violation of the Advent ist Health Corporate Compliance Program. Your local compliance officer can provide more detailed informa tion regarding the protections afforded employees under the Federal and State Fals e Claims Acts. Our Responsibilities in Safegua rding Business and Financial Information Accuracy, Retention, and Disposal of Documents and Records Each SHNV Staff member is responsible for the integrity and accur acy of our organization's documents and records, not only to comply with re gulatory and legal requirements, but also to ensure that records are available to s upport our business practices and actions. No one may alter or falsify information on any record or document. Records must never be destroyed in an effort to deny government al authorities information that may be relevant to a government investigation. Medical and business documents and records are retained in acco rdance with the law and our record retention policy. Medical and business documents inc lude paper documents such as letters and memos, computer-based information such as e -mail or computer files on disk or tape, and any other medium that contains information about the organization or its business activities. It is important to retain and destroy records only acco rding with our policy. SHNV Staff must not tamper with records. No one may remov e or destroy records prior to the specified date without first obtaining permission as outlined in the SHNV records management policy. Coding and Billing for Services We communicate our billing policies to all our patients prior t o, or, at the time of service or admission. We bill our patients for services rendered and provi de itemized bills free of charge upon request. Our patient financial services office respo nds to patient questions in 07/22/2013 8a timely and courteous manner. We perform annual audits to ensu re the accuracy of our bills. We make adjustments to correct any over or under billings . We have implemented policies, procedures and systems to facilita te accurate billing to our government payers, commercial insurance payers, and patients. T hese policies, procedures, and systems conform to pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. We prohibit any SHNV Staff member from knowingly presenting or causin g to be presented claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious, or f raudulent. In support of accurate billing, medical records must provide re liable documentation of the services we provided. It is important that all individuals who contribute to the medical record provide accurate information and do not destroy any info rmation considered part of the official medical record. Accurate and timely documentation also depends on the diligence and attention of physicians who treat patients in our facilities. We expect physicians to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner. Confidential Information: The term \"confidential information\" refers to proprietary infor mation about our organization's strategies and operations as well as patient inf o r m a t i o n a n d t h i r d p a r t y information. Improper use or disclosure of confidential informa tion could violate legal and ethical obligations. SHNV Staff may use confidential information only to perform their job responsibilities. We do not share this information with others unless the individuals, entities, and/or contractual business relationships have a legi timate need to know. Consistent with HIPAA, we do not use, disclose or discuss patie nt specific information, including patient financial information, with others unless it is necessary to serve the patient or required by law .Any breach of confidentiality represents a failure to meet the professional and ethical standards expected, and constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct. A full confidentiality statement is received and acce pted by each employee as part of the SHNV Employee Handbook. Cost Reports We are required by federal and state laws and regulations to su bmit certain reports outlining our operating costs and statistics. We comply with fede ral and state laws, regulations, and guidelines relating to all cost reports. These laws, regulations, and guidelines define what costs are allowable and outline the appr opriate methodologies we may use to claim reimbursement for the cost of services provide d. All issues related to the preparation, submission and settlemen t of cost reports must be performed in accordance with the Adventist Health Cost Reportin g Program Policies and Procedures. Electronic Medical and Security Requirements All communication systems, including but not limited to compute rs, electronic mail, Intranet, Internet access, telephones, and voice mail, are the property of the organization and are to be used primarily for business purposes in accordanc e with electronic communication policies and procedures. Limited reasonable person al use of SHNV 07/22/2013 9communication systems is permitted; however, users should assum e these communications are not private. Users of computer and telephone s y s t e m s s h o u l d presume no expectation of privacy in anything they create, stor e, send, or receive on SHNV computer and telephone systems, and SHNV reserves the right to monitor and/or access communication usage and content consistent with our poli cies and procedures. SHNV Staff who abuse our communication systems or use them excess ively for non- business purposes may lose these privileges and be subject to d isciplinary action. SHNV Staff must comply with SHNV's information security policies and standards governing the use of our information systems. User IDs and pass words are assigned to an individual. SHNV Staff are not permitted to share or disclose an y password that is used to access SHNV's systems or information. Financial Reporting and Records SHNV maintains a high standard of accuracy and completeness in d ocumenting, managing, and reporting financial information. This information s e r v e s a s a b a s i s f o r managing our business and is important in meeting our obligatio ns to patients, staff, suppliers, and others. It is also necessary for compliance with tax and financial reporting requirements. All financial information must reflect actual transactions and conform to generally-accepted accounting principles. All funds or assets must be properly reco rded. SHNV maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance tha t all transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and are recorded in a proper manner to maintain accountability of the assets. Intellectual Property Rights and Obligations Any work of authorship, inventions, or other creation created b y a staff member during the scope of his or her employment with SHNV shall be considered the property of SHNV, including any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or oth er intellectual property right. Our Responsibilities to Our SHNV Staff Conflict of Interest A conflict of interest may occur if a SHNV Staff's outside activ ities, personal financial interest, or other private interest interfere or appear to inte rfere with his or her ability to make objective decisions in the course of his or her job respon sibilities. Conflicts of interest also arise when a SHNV Staff member or a member of his or her fam ily receives improper benefits as a result of his or her position in SHNV. SHNV Staff ar e obligated to ensure they remain free of conflicts of interest in the performance of their responsibilities at SHNV. Clinical decisions are made wit hout regard to c ompensation or p ersonal financial benefit to SHNV leaders, managers, clinical staff, or licensed independent practitioners. You are encouraged to raise any questions involving this policy with th e Vice President for Human Resources or the Compliance Department before becoming engaged in outside activities or relationships that may give rise to an actual or perceived c onflict. 07/22/2013 10If SHNV Staff do become involved in a transaction where personal i nterests conflict with SHNV's interests, they are required to disclose that conflict to a supervisor, the Human Resources Department or the Compliance Department. SHNV Board m embers, executives, and directors are required to sign a Conflict of Intere st Statement in accordance with the SHNV Conflict of Interest Policy. No waiver of this conflict of interest provision may be granted unless approved in advance by the Compliance Committee. Controlled Substances/ Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace The dangers of drug and/or alcohol abuse are numerous, includin g the risks of loss of life, physical damage to people and property, a decline in morale and productivity, and deterioration in the quality of goods and services produced. Ou r policy is to maintain a drug/alcohol-free workplace. Thus, the unlawful manufacture, di stribution, dispensing, possession or use of a controlled substance or alcohol is prohi bited in our workplace. All SHNV Staff must report for work free of the influence of alcohol and illegal drugs. Any SHNV Staff member who reports to work under the influence of any i llegal drug or alcohol, has an illegal drug in his or her system, or who uses, possesses, or sells illegal drugs while on SHNV work time or property may be terminated immediately. We m ay use drug testing as a means of enforcing this policy. Some of our staff routinely have access to prescription drugs, c ontrolled substances, and other medical supplies. Many of these substances are governed a nd monitored by specific regulatory organizations and must be administered by physician order only. Prescription and controlled medications and supplies must be handled properl y and only by authorized individuals to minimize risks to S HNV and to patients. Any SHNV St aff member who becomes aware of inadequate security of drugs or controlled sub stances or the diversion of drugs from the organization must report it immediately. As a condition of continued employment, SHNV Staff are expected an d required to abide by this policy and to notify their department manager of any cr iminal drug/alcohol statute conviction against them no later than 5 calendar days after suc h conviction. A conviction means a finding of guilt, including a plea of nolo contender or imposition of a sentence or both by any judicial body charg ed with the responsibility to de termine violations of the federal or state criminal drug/ alcohol statutes. Diversity and Equal Emp loyment Opportunity SHNV actively promotes diversity in its workforce at all levels of the organization. We are committed to providing an inclusive work environment where ever yone is treated with fairness, dignity, and respect. We are accountable to each othe r for the manner in which we treat one another and for the manner in which people around u s are treated. We are committed to recruiting and retaining a diverse staff that is ref lective of the patients and community we serve. We regard laws, regulations and policies re lating to diversity as a minimum standard. We strive to create and maintain a setting in which we celebrate cultural and other differences and consider them strengths. SHNV maintains an equal opportunity workforce and no one shall u nlawfully discriminate against any individual with regard to race, color, religion, ge nder, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, g ender identity or veteran stat us with respect to any offer, or 07/22/2013 11term or condition, of employment. We make reasonable accommodat ions to the known physical and mental limitation of qualified individuals with di sabilities. Harassment and Disruptive Behavior SHNV seeks to provide a work environment that is free of all for ms of discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment and disruptive behavior .Prohibited forms of discriminatory harassment include, but are not limited to, oral , physical or visual harassment. SHNV considers unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual f avors, remarks or jokes of a sexual nature, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature to constitute sexual harassment when: I. submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or impli citly a term or condition of an individual's employment; II. employment decisions concerning an individual are based on w hether the person submitted to or rejected the harassing action; and/or III. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably inter fering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, host ile or offensive working environment\u2014even where it leads to no tangible or economic job c onsequences. We strongly disapprove of discriminatory harassment in any form . We do not tolerate harassment by anyone based on the cultural backgrounds of those who work with us. Degrading or humiliating jokes, slurs, intimidations, or other harassing conduct is not acceptable in our workplace. Sexual harassment is considered t o be sex discrimination in violation of applicable state and federal law subjecting the ha rassing employee to legal liability. SHNV Staff who observe or experience any form of alleged discrimi nation, discriminatory harassment or violence should be reported to either a department head or the Human Resources department. The law protects SHNV Staff from any retali ation for reporting or participating in the investigation of discrimination or discrim inatory harassment. A prompt and thorough investigation of the alleged incident will be cond ucted. To the extent possible, the investigation and any subsequent action will proc eed in an atmosphere of confidentiality. We will take all appropriate steps to enforce this policy, including termination or other disciplinary action, against persons who h ave violated this policy. SHNV Staff who have submitted a complaint of discrimination or dis criminatory harassment addressed under this policy should immediately make a further complaint if the discrimination or discriminatory harassment resumes. Health and Safety SHNV complies with all workplace health and safety rules and reg ulations. Our policies and practices are designed to protect our staff from potential workplace hazards. SHNV Staff need to be familiar with these policies and how they apply to their specific job responsibilities. Each staff member should seek advice from his or her supervisor, or the hospital's Safety Officer, whenever he/she has a question or co ncern. It is important that each staff member immediately advise a supervisor or the Safety O fficer of any serious 07/22/2013 12workplace injury or any situation presenting a danger of injury . Immediate notification allows for timely corrective actions. Environmental Compliance It is SHNV policy to comply with all environmental laws and regu lations as they relate to SHNV's operations. We act to preserve our natural resources to the full extent reasonably possible. SHNV complies with all environmental laws and operates its facilities with the necessary permits, approvals, and controls. We diligently emplo y the proper procedures to provide a good environment of care and to prevent pollution. In helping SHNV comply with these laws and regulations, all SHNV Staff must understand how job duties may impact the environment. Staff must adhere to all requirements for the proper handling of hazardous material, and immediately alert su pervisors to any situation regarding the discharge of a hazardous substance, improper disp osal of hazardous and medical waste, or any situation that may be potential damaging to the environment. Hiring of Former and Current Gover nment and Medicare Administra tive Contractor Employees The recruitment and employment of former or current U.S. govern ment employees may be impacted by regulations concerning conflicts of interest. Hirin g employees directly from a Medicare Administrative Contractor requires certain regulatory notifications. Staff should consult with the Human Resources Department or the Compliance D epartment regarding such recruitment and hiring. Ineligible Persons We do not contract with, employ, or bill for services rendered by any individual or entity: (1) that is excluded or ineligible to participate in federal hea lthcare programs; (2) that was suspended or debarred from federal government contracts and not reinstated in a federal healthcare program after a period of exclusion, suspension, deb arment, or ineligibility; or (3) has been convicted of a criminal offense that falls within the scope of 42 U.S.C. 1320a- 7(a), but has not yet been excluded, debarred, suspended or oth erwise declared ineligible (each, an \"Ineligible Person\"). Upon hire we search the Departmen t of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General, Exclusive Parties List Sy stem (EPLS) and General Services Administration's lists for such Ineligible Persons. All SHNV Staff must disclose to SHNV any debarment, exclusion, su spension or other event that makes that person an Ineligible Person within twenty -four (24) hours of becoming aware of such event. SHNV will remove known Ineligible Persons from responsibility for, or involvem ent with, SHNV's business operat ions related to Federal health care programs and will remove them from any position for which their compensation or the items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed by s uch individual are paid by a Federal health care program or with Federal funds at least unti l such time as such individual is reinstated into participation in the Federal heal th care programs. If SHNV has actual notice that a SHNV Staff is charged with a crim inal offense that falls within the scope of 42 USC \u00a7 1320a-7(a), (b)(1)-(3), or if prop osed for exclusion during such individual's employment or contract term SHNV will take all appropriate actions to ensure that the responsibilities of such individual have not an d shall not adversely affect 07/22/2013 13the quality of care rendered to any patient or any claims submi tted to a Federal health care program. Insider Information/Confidential Information In the course of employment with St Helena Hospital Napa Valley and St Helena Center For Behavioral Health, SHNV Staff may become aware of non-public information about SHNV that is material to the SHNV's business strategy and operat ions. Non-public, material information may include, among other things, plans for mergers, marketing strategy, financial results, or other business dealings. SHNV St aff may not discuss this type of information with anyone outside the organization. Withi n the organization, SHNV Staff should discuss this information on a strictly \"need-to-kn ow\" basis and only with other SHNV Staff who require this information to perform their jobs. License and Certification Renewals SHNV Staff, individuals retained as independent contractors, an d privileged practitioners in positions which require professional licenses, certification s, or other credentials are responsible for maintaining current credentials and shall comply at all times with federal and state requirements applicable to their respective disciplin es. SHNV does not allow any SHNV Staff member, independent contractor or privileged practitioner to work without a valid, current license or creden tial. Each SHNV Staff member must have evidence of current and valid license, certification, registration, accreditation or credential as required by their position description. Copyright and Intellectual Property SHNV respects the ownership rights of those creating physical, d igital, and intellectual property. Copyright infringement is using copyrighted property without the owner's permission. This unauthorized use is also called piracy. Exam ples could include using unlicensed software, distributing many copies of non-public boo ks or articles, and using business models (intellectual property) without consent or cred it. SHNV Staff will not utilize copyrighted physical, digital, and intellectual property withou t the prior written permission of the owner. Personal Use of SHNV Resources Credit cards, desks, and other items provided by SHNV continue t o remain organizational property, must be maintained in accordance with SHNV's policies, and used only for business purposes. SHNV reserves the right to monitor and inspec t all organizational property, without notice, and without the SHNV Staff member presen t. SHNV may monitor and inspect organizational property even if a password or perso nal code has been assigned. Prior authorization must be obtained before the remov al of any organizational property from the premises. All organizational property must be returned immediately upon request or termination in the same condition as when originally provided. Personal items brought onto the organization's property also are subject to in spection, without notice, and without the SHNV Staff member present. Relationships a mong SHNV Staff 07/22/2013 14In the normal day-to-day functions of an organization like SHNV , there are issues that arise from how people in the organization relate to one another. It is impossible to foresee all of these issues, and many do not require explicit treatment in this Code of Conduct. While we wish to avoid any strict rules, no one should ever feel compelled to give a gift to anyone for a birthday, holiday or other celebration, and any gif ts offered or received should be appropriate to the circumstances. A lavish gift to anyone in a supervisory role would clearly violate organization policy. Similarly, If SHNV agrees t o support a charitable organization, no SHNV Staff member should feel compelled to contr ibute to the charitable organization, nor should there be any workplace consequences of such non-participation. For reasons of supervision, safety, security and morale, family members will not be employed under the direct supervision of one another nor will th ey be placed in the same department, division or facility if the work involves potential conflicts of interest. For these reasons, as well to avoid misunderstandings, complaints of favor itism or possible claims of sex discrimination or sexual harassment, managers and superviso rs are prohibited from establishing, maintaining, or attempting to establish or mainta i n a r o m a n t i c o r s e x u a l relationship with any subordinate employee within their chain o f command. The term \"family members\" includes a SHNV Staff member's parents, children (na tural, adopted or under legal guardianship), spouse, brothers, sisters, grandpare nts, grandchildren, cousins, aunts, uncles, in-laws and step-relationships with all the prec eding relationships. An exception to this policy is allowed only with the approval of t he Vice President of Human Resources. If co-employees become related, or if a supervisor and a subord inate attempt to or establish or maintain a romantic or sexual relationship, it sho uld be reported promptly to the immediate supervisor of the manager or supervisor who is rel ated or involved in the relationship. If co-employees become related, we will make reas onable efforts to assign job duties so as to minimize problems of supervision, safety, s ecurity or morale. Relationships with Subc ontractors and Suppliers SHNV has a Code of Conduct and Business Relationship Statement t hat outlines its commitment to ethical and compliant behavior and its expectatio ns of the same by its contractors. We treat our vendors fairly and maintain impartiali ty in our relationships. We do not allow our friendships with our vendors or others with wh om we may do business in the future to affect our business decisions. Charitable gifts or contributions from vendors are not required , and have no bearing upon their actual or potential business relationship with us. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, subsidies to underwrite the costs of medical ed ucation or professional meetings are permitted, in that they benefit patient care and c ommunity health. SHNV Staff must manage consulting, subcontractor, and supplier r elationships in a fair and reasonable manner, free from conflicts of interest and cons istent with all applicable laws. SHNV promotes competitive procurement to the maximum extent p r a c t i c a b l e . SHNV's selection of consultants, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendors will be made on the basis of objective criteria including quality, technical ex cellence, price, delivery, adherence to schedules, service, and maintenance of adequate so urces of supply. Our purchasing decisions will be made on the supplier's ability to meet our needs, and not on personal relationships and friendships. SHNV employs the highest ethical standards in business practices in source selection, negotiation, determinat ion of contract awards, and 07/22/2013 15the administration of all purchasing activities. SHNV complies w ith contractual obligations not to disclose vendor confidential information unless permitte d under the contract or otherwise authorized by the vendor. It is critical to avoid the appearance of impropriety when givi ng gifts to individuals who do business or are seeking to do business with SHNV. SHNV will never u s e g i f t s o r o t h e r incentives to improperly influence relationships or business ou tcomes. Our Responsibilities while Developing Business and Marketing Se rvices SHNV operates in a highly competitive environment. SHNV's busines s development and marketing activities must conform to the highest standards of inte grity and fairness reflected in this Code of Conduct. SHNV requires compliance with an titrust and other laws governing competitive activities. Antitrust and Unfair Competition SHNV restricts communication with competitors. Generally, SHNV Sta ff are not to discuss with competitors non-public \"competitively sensitive topics.\" B ecause the antitrust laws are so complex and their application can depend upon the conditions in local markets, it is not practical to adopt written polices to govern all situations. SHN V Staff should consult with their supervisors or the Compliance Department for guidance conce rning competitive activities, laws and polices relating to their areas of respons ibility. Marketing and Advertising Consistent with laws and regulations that governs such activitie s, SHNV uses marketing and advertising to educate the public, provide information to t he community, increase awareness of services provided by SHNV, and for recruitment pur poses. SHNV strives to present only truthful, fully informative, and non-deceptive inf ormation in these materials and announcements. SHNV will not distort the truth about service s or products provided by the hospital, nor will we attack or disparage another provider, whether by name or implication, in any marketing or advertising efforts. We may fe ature our outstanding services or offer factual evidence of quality of care, but will not claim superiority where it cannot be substantiated. Our Responsibilities in our Relat ionships with other Companies This part of the Code of Conduct should not be considered in an y way as an encouragement to make, solicit, or receive any type of entrainm ent or gift. Receiving Business Courtesies We do not expect any gifts from our vendors beyond good service. However, SHNV recognizes that there will be times when a current or potential business associate, including a potential referral source, extends an invitation to a SHNV Staff member to attend a social event, in order to further develop or provide appr eciation of a current business relationship. All gifts, entertainment and business m eals provided or received must be reasonable and small enough that they do not influence o ur decisions. We never 07/22/2013 16offer or accept anything of value in exchange for referrals or other business. We let our vendors, physicians, customers and others know that our core va lues limit what we can receive or give. We want our services and business relationship s to stand on their own. What is a gift? It is anything of value - including traditional mar keting items like t-shirts or logoed items - if the recipient receives it for free. We should r ecognize there is a difference between a simple pen and an expensive electronic device from a vendor. What constitutes entertainment? This includes an invitation to ev ents, sports activities or games or concerts where the recipient is not expected to pay fo r a ticket or participation fee. We should recognize there is a difference between attendin g a community-supported or non-profit gala and front-row seats at an expensive event. What constitutes a business meal? This is any meal where the pri mary purpose of the meeting is to discuss SHNV business or quality initiatives. If you question a gift or participation in an entertainment even t, contact the Compliance Department. Extending Business Courtesi es to Non-Referral Sources 1. Meals and Entertainment. - There may be times when a SHNV Staff member wishes to extend to a current or potential business associate (o ther than someone who may be in a position to make a patient referral) an invitatio n to attend a social event (e.g., reception, meal, sporting event) to further or dev elop a business relationship. The purpose of the entertainment must never be to induce any favorable business action. During these events, topics of a bus iness nature must be discussed and the host must be present. 2. Sponsoring Business Events - SHNV sponsors events for legitimate b usiness purposes (e.g., hospital board meetings or retreats). These even ts may include SHNV paid meals, entertainment, transportation and lodging. Howe ver, all elements of these events, including these courtesy elements, must be cons istent with the corporate policy on business events. 3. Gifts - It is critical to avoid the appearance of impropriety when giving gifts to individuals who do business or are seeking to do business with SHNV. We will never use gifts or other incentives to improperly influence relat ionships or business outcomes. In order to avoid embarrassment, an effort should be made to ensure that any gift we extend meets the business conduct standards of the recipient's organization. U.S. federal and state governments have strict rule s and laws regarding gifts, means and other business courtesies for their employees. SHNV does not provide any gifts, entertainment or anything else of v alue to any employee of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government or its fiscal intermediaries, except for minor refreshments in connection with business discu ssion. Our Responsibilities in our Relat ionships with Government Agenc ies and Officials 07/22/2013 17SHNV and its representatives comply with all federal, state, and local laws governing participation in government relations and political activities. As a general policy, SHNV funds or resources will not contribute directly to individual pol itical campaigns, political parties or other organizations that intend to use the funds prim arily for political campaign objectives. At times, SHNV may ask SHNV Staff to make personal contact with g overnment officials or to write letters to present our positions on specific issues. I n addition, it is part of the role of some SHNV management to interface on a regular basis with govern ment officials. If a SHNV Staff member is making these communications on behalf of the organization, he/she must be certain to be familiar with any regulatory constr aints and observe them. At no time may SHNV Staff speak on behalf of SHNV without first bein g given consent by the CEO or his/her designee. Avenues of communication may include tr aditional ways such as telephone and letters along with newer ways such as social medi a. Guidance is always available from the Compliance Department as necessary. How We Ensure Compliance with our Code of Conduct Program Structure The Compliance Program is intended to demonstrate in the cleare st possible terms our absolute commitment to the highest standards of conduct, ethics , and compliance. The elements of the program include setting standards, communicating those standards, providing mechanisms for reporting concerns, monitoring and audi ting, program effectiveness, and maintaining an organizational structure that continues to support the Compliance Program. These elements are supported at all levels of SHNV. The Corporate Compliance Committee is responsible for providing direction, gu idance and oversight to senior leadership and the Local Compliance Committee. The SHNV Compliance Officer and the Compliance Department are re sponsible for the day-to-day direction, coordination and any applicable revisions or updates of the Code of Conduct and the Compliance Program. This includes developing reso urces (including policies and procedures, training programs, and communication to ols), distributing standards, providing support (including operating the Complianc e hotline, conducting program assessment, and providing advice), ensuring compliance w ith training requirements and otherwise administering the program.In support of the SHNV Compliance Officer, SHNV Senior Leaders hav e expertise in various areas of compliance and are called upon to lead policy a nd training development efforts, conduct monitoring and auditing as appropriate, and pr ovide advice. Additionally, the Vice President of Human Resources, the hospital Risk Manage r, and the Accreditation Coordinator are all important resources that may be accessed to address issues arising out of this Code of Conduct. SHNV's Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring the functi oning of the Local Compliance Committee. Setting Standards SHNV sets standards through this Code of Conduct, along with our a ssociated policies and procedures and the annual or periodic (for applicable positi ons) compliance program training. It is the responsibility of each individual to be aware of these policies and 07/22/2013 18procedures, how they pertain to his or her work, and to follow t hese policies and procedures. Training and Communication Comprehensive training and education has been developed to ensu re that SHNV Staff are aware of the standards that apply to them. Code of Conduct train ing is conducted at the time an individual joins SHNV and annually for all SHNV Staff. Com pliance training in areas of compliance risk (e.g., billing, coding, cost reports) is required of certain individuals. SHNV and Adventist Health policies outline the trai ning requirements. For SHNV employees, all training is recorded within our complian ce education system. System administrators and the Compliance Officer can track emplo yee compliance with their training requirements and report such information as nece ssary. Non-employees will receive training as required by applicable requirements or regu lations. Personal Obligation to Report SHNV is committed to ethical and legal conduct that is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations, and to correct wrongdoing wherever it may occur at SHNV. Each SHNV Staff has an individual responsibility to report any activity by any staff, physician, subcontractor, or vendor that appears to violate applicable law, rules, regula tions, accreditation standards, standards of medical practice, federal healthcare co nditions of participation, or this Code of Conduct. If any SHNV Staff member or Board member has concerns, we encoura ge you to report it through one of our reporting compliance program options identif ied below so that we may investigate and resolve the issue. However, if you believe we ha v e l e f t a n i s s u e unresolved, the matter can be reported to other entities such as Adventist Health, the Medical Board of California, The Joint Commission, and the Depa rtment of Public Health. There will be no retaliatory disciplinary action taken against any individual who reports concerns to any of these entities.

During their first phone call they discussed what she wanted to work on regarding her health and fitness, set goals, and planned how she could achieve those goals. \"My health coach has been very encouraging and has given me great tips both by phone and email. I think that having a health coach is a great benefit provided by Adventist Health. It helps to have someone objective to talk with about my personal goals. It gives me an opportunity to step back and assess what I am doing, so that I can achieve better health.\" Lori has continued to check in with her health coach every few weeks regarding her progress toward her health goals.

SUPPORT, STRENGTH AND SUCCESS: LOSING 226.4 POUNDS WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS \"I started working on my weight in 2013 by joining Weight Watchers, which I am still active in. By February of 2014 I had lost 100 lbs. all from just eating better. At that time I was unable to exercise from the severe back pain I had, and I could barely walk or stand for five minutes at a time. From 2014 to 2015 I had stopped losing weight \u2014 I had plateaued, and whether I gained or lost weight, I was always within a couple pounds of the 100 I had lost. In May of 2015 I needed emergency back surgery and it was a complete success, even if I didn't think so at the time. After the surgery, I became depressed. I turned back to food for comfort and ended up gaining 60 lbs. back of what I had lost. In January of 2016 I started to focus on what was positive in my life and then on my weight. I started going to Weight Watchers meetings again and walking. It was in July of 2016 that I started going to the gym and exercising, and I still am going to the gym faithfully each week. Exercise was what was missing from my life, it is exactly what I needed. I currently weigh 221.2 pounds. Eating better, exercising, going to Weight Watchers and having the love and support of family, friends, co-workers and the community has been amazing and so very helpful.\"Matthew Hartke EMR coordinator, Home Health & Hospice Adventist Health Home Health & Hospice Services Mendocino CountyLivingWell: Adventist Health's whole-person health and wellness program LivingWell is offered to all employees and is required for all Engaged!

Adventist Health's LivingWell program has encouraged this already-fit pair to develop an even healthier lifestyle. You might think marathon runners couldn't possibly have much room to improve, but each of them credits the LivingWell program for important health outcomes. Vicki began running in 1987 with her husband. They were inspired by watching the Portland Marathon and wanted to do it for themselves. Starting with just one-mile runs, they worked their way up to full marathons. Vicki's husband, Gary, completed 72 marathons before he passed away in 2012. His goal was to run 100 marathons, which Vicki and Emillie have decided to complete in his memory. For Emillie, running marathons was something she picked up after her parents had started. She was overweight and decided she wanted to take control of her life. Vicki trained with her daughter and walked and ran with her during her first marathon. Training for marathons takes a lot of time, discipline and dedication. For Vicki and Emillie it's something they share. Through their weekly long runs they spend time talking and even in prayer. With the ultimate goal in sight, Vicki and Emillie have completed a marathon every two weeks since March 2017. Vicki completed her 100th marathon on July 15. INSPIRED BY LIVINGWELL \"Being part of an organization that emphasizes wellness means so much to me,\" says Vicki. \"The LivingWell program has helped me improve my health by changing how I eat. Because of classes and challenges that have been offered at work I've moved to a diet with more whole, plant-based foods. I used to be on medication for my blood pressure, but by eating differently I no longer need it.\" Emillie's experience is similar. \"It's a lot of small things,\" she says. \"From signs encouraging us to take the stairs, and information about walking routes on campus, there's a culture of being active. The LivingWell challenges give us the opportunity to explore new and different aspects of our health. A fruit and veggie challenge helped me jump start improvements in the way I was eating. That's helped me lower my cholesterol by 22 points.\" Vicki Classen, telephone operator at Adventist Health Portland, and her daughter, Emillie Niblack, customer care associate, are grateful for their health and fitness achievements. 11\"In January I was in a really bad place when it came to taking care of myself. In April 2017 I decided to go to the TakeTEN program in St. Helena. Three months later I am completely transformed, inside and out. I have lost 21 pounds and have re-prioritized both my physical and mental health. Looking back at pictures I can see now what I couldn't see then. It hasn't always been easy, but I know that I'm worth it. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm well on my way, and I know I won't ever go back. TakeTEN was a life-changing experience for me, and I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to go. Take care of yourself. Prioritize yourself. Believe in yourself. Love yourself.\" \u2014Jennifer Cowan, Engaged! Premier Program member 12Why do I have to complete LivingWell points if I am already healthy? LivingWell is a lifestyle.

A group of employees at Millsbridge Family Care, Adventist Health Lodi Memorial, decided it was time for a Biggest Loser Challenge. The eight-week challenge encouraged them to get into shape, eat healthier, and win a prize. Throughout the eight weeks, they motivated each other by holding everyone accountable to sticking to their weight loss strategies. Losing weight is not an easy task; however, a supportive environment greatly aids in achieving one's health goals. \"My strategies that drove success were working out just about every day, paying attention to what I was eating, and practicing portion control.\" After eight weeks she was able to drop 11.6 pounds. \"I learned that portion control was the key to success. I have always been very active with sports and exercise but lacked a true control over my eating habits. I'm now eating breakfast every day which works to shape the rest of my meals for the day.\" As a group, the Biggest Loser Challenge participants lost nearly 60 pounds.

You have the opportunity to redirect a portion of your wages on a pretax basis for benefits available through the Plan. Health care and dependent care expense reimbursements are administered through separate flexible spending accounts. WHAT IS THE WELFARE PLAN CONTRIBUTION BENEFIT? Your pretax dollars make contribution payments for coverage under your employer's group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plan. You make an election when you are hired and you complete the welfare plan enrollment forms. If you choose not to enroll when you are hired, you may add the benefit on a post - tax basis. The contributions will automatically roll over to pretax withholdings at the beginning of the next Plan Year. Your employer must receive written notification before a new Plan Year if you decide to change your withholdi ng election. When insignificant cost increases occur your employer will automatically change contribution deductions. Welfare plan benefits are payable based on the terms of these plans or policies. Benefit selections are subject to Cafeteria Plan qualifyi ng election change event rules that are similar to those in the table at Appendix A. Please discuss changes with Human Resources to ensure you comply with the IRS Regulations. WHAT IS THE HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT BENEFIT? Eligible health care expenses incurred but not reimbursed under any other health plan can be reimbursed from this account based on your redirection election. WHAT IS THE DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT BENEFIT? Eligible dependent care expenses incurred in order to enable you and your spouse to be employed can be reimbursed from this account based on your redirection election. SALARY REDIRECTION AGREEMENT You may elect to sign an agreement by which you authorize the Company to redirect a portion of your salary and contribute t he amount of that redirection on your behalf (as a before -tax contribution) to the benefit(s) of your choice. 2 WHAT IS THE CURRENT MAXIMUM AMOUNT A PARTICIPANT CAN CONTRIBUTE? The maximum spendable dollars for the Plan Year are $17,000. Welfare Plan contributions are limited to actual charges for coverages elected. The maximum annual Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account election is $2,600. The maximum annual Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account election is $5,000 for single employees and married employees who file joint returns. Married employees filing separate returns are limited to $2,500. MAY ELECTIONS BE CHANGED DURING A PLAN YEAR? The legal requirements of a Cafeteria Plan do not permit salary redirection election changes during a Plan Year unless a qualifying election change event occurs. In that case, you may make a new election due to and consistent with your qualifying event. The table in Appendix A details qualifying election change event scenarios allowed by the IRS. WHO IS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PLAN? Adventist Health is the Administrator of the Plan. Adventist Health has the right to interpret the Plan and to modify elections by employees in accordance with any legal requirements relating to the Plan. If I Need More Information, W hom Should I Contact? If you need more information about the Cafeteria Plan, please call the Flexible Spending Administrator, Benefits Administration at 800- 441-2524. Participating Employers The entities that have elected to participate in the Plan are: Adventist Health Corporate , Portland Adventist Medical Center, Hanford Community Hospital , Reedley Community Hospital , Adventist Health Physicians Network, Castle Medical Center, Feather River Hospital, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Willits Hospital, Lodi Memorial Hospital Association, Inc. , St. Helena Hospital Napa Valley , Adventist Health Clear lake Hospital, Inc. , San Joaquin Community Hospital, Simi Valley Hospital and Health Care Services , Sonora Community Hospital , Adventist Health Medical Center Tehachapi, Northwest Medical Foundation of Tillamook , Ukiah Adventist Hospital , Western Health Resources, and White Memorial Medical Center 3 CAFETERIA PLAN BOOKLET GENERAL INFORMATION AN OVERVIEW Adventist Health (the \"Company\") offers you the opportunity t o choose between cash and the following benefits: Welfare Plan Contribution Benefit Health Care Expense Reimbursement Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Under the welfare plan contribution benefit, the dollar amounts that you elect to redirect from yo ur salary on a pretax basis under this Plan will be used to make contribution payments for coverage periods occurring within the Plan Year under the (i) group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plans. . Your pretax salary reduction amounts will be paid directly to the plan(s) or insurer(s). Benefits will be payable according to the terms of the respective plans or policies. In addition, the two reimbursement account options allow you to pay eligible health care and dependent care expenses with before- tax earnings. All three options reduc e your income taxes below what you would pay if you bought the same coverages on an after -tax basis . When you participate, you agree to redirect part of your paycheck for your welfare plan or reimbursement account contributions before Social Security and federal and state income taxes have been withheld. You pay less in taxes because your taxable income is reduced by the amount of your redirection. After you incur eligible expenses, you request reimbursement from th e appropriate account in tax -free dollars. Note: No actual accounts are established, the Flexible Spending Accounts are merely bookkeeping accounts established to keep track of your contributions. Benefits are paid as needed from the Company's general as sets. Redirection of your wages reduces your salary for Social Security purposes. You may receive a lower Social Security benefit at retirement, death or during disability. This employee booklet and the attached table in Appendix A (collectively the \"booklet\") describe the basic features of the Adventist Health System/West Cafeteria Plan (the \"Plan\" or \"Cafeteria Plan\" ), how it operates and how you can get the maximum advantage from it. The Company has established the Plan pursuant to a P lan Document in to which this booklet has been incorporated. However, if there is a conflict between the official P lan Document and the booklet, the P lan Document will govern. Coverage under the group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plans is discussed in a summar y or an official certificate of coverage you receive from the Administrator of the Plan or insurance carrier. If there is a discrepancy between this booklet and the summary or certificate of coverage you receive from the Administrator of the Plan or insur ance carrier, the summary or certificate of coverage will govern. 4 ELIGIBILITY You are eligible to participate in the Plan if you are a regular full -time, part -time, or per diem employee as those classifications are defined in the applicable Participating Employer's personnel policy and procedure manual. DATE OF PARTICIPATION If you are an eligible employee, you will become a Participant in the Plan on the first day of the pay period following your completion of the necessary enrollment forms. Welfare plans may have different effective dates. Please refer to those Plan Documents. If you become an eligible employee after the Plan Year has begun, you must enroll in the Plan within the first 31 days of becoming an eligible employee. If you do not enroll when you are first eligible, you must wait to enroll in the Plan until the next annual enrollment period unless you experience a qualifying election change event. Welfare plans may allow enrollment throughout the Plan Year. The contributions will not be wit hheld on a pretax basis if the enrollment does not occur within the first 31 days of becoming an eligible employee. The enrollment period will be held annually, at dates set by the Administrator of the Plan, before the beginning of the Plan Year for which elections are being made. If you enroll during the enrollment period, you must wait until the next annual enrollment period to change your elections, except in certain cases where you have a qualifying election change event. The table in Appendix A deta ils qualifying election change event scenarios allowed by the IRS. ENROLLING IN THE PLAN During the annual enrollment period (or during the first 31 days after you become an eligible employee), you need to indicate whether you want to participate in any of the following: Welfare Plan C ontribution Benefit Health Care Expense Reimbursement Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement You may, of course, decline participation if you wish. As an eligible employee, you will have an opportunity to enroll once each year. If you fail to make an election during the annual enrollment period, your elections will remain the same for the following Plan Year for the welfare plan contribution benefit. To continue participating in the reimbursement accounts, you must re -enroll eac h year during the annual enrollment period. CHANGING OR STOPPING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS Your contribution (your election) amount will stay in place for the coverage period, unless you have a qualifying election change event. The change to your Salary Redirect ion Agreement must be requested during the 31- day period immediately after the qualifying change and must be due to and consistent with such change. (Please refer to the CHANGE IN BENEFIT ELECTIONS FORM .) The Administrator of the Plan will review and eit her approve or deny the request for the change in election. If approved, the change will be effective the first pay period AFTER the approval is granted, except in the case of birth, adoption or placement for adoption in which case the change will be effe ctive the date of the event when the enrollment form is received within 30 days of the event. 5 If you take a general leave of absence other than a leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), you may elect to continue participation in the Plan and pay your share of contributions with after-tax dollars while on leave Alternatively, you may prepay the contributions for the expected duration of the leave on a pretax salary reduction basis out of your pre -leave salary. If you elect to prepay your share of the contributions before your leave, you must make a special election to that effect before the first pay period for which the deductions will be made. Dependent care accounts must be terminated or suspended prior to taking a Leave of Absence as expenses for daycare/childcare are not eligible for reimbursement while out on leave. If you elect to terminate coverage during an unpaid Leave of Absence, you must submit a Change in Benefit Elections form (1) before your leave and (2) another form within 31 days after returning to work in order to reinstate participation. Reinstatement will be at the same rates of coverage in effect before the Leave of Absence unless there has been another qualifying election change event. TRANSFERS BETWEEN PARTICIPATING EMPLOYE RS If you transfer from one Participating Employer to another, the health care and dependent care expense reimbursement benefits you elected will transfer with you. You will have to re- enroll for the welfare -plan contribution salary reduction; however, this will not be considered a change in election. Your health plan and AD&D coverage must remain the same as that originally elected with the first employer unless a qualifying election change event occurs as a result of the transfer. In that case, an election change may be made consistent with such qualifying election change event. PLAN YEAR January 1 through December 31. COVERAGE PERIOD Period during Plan Year you are an Eligible Employee and have elected to participate in the Plan. DEBIT CARD The flexi ble spending account offers the Take Care debit card. The Take Care debit card through Adventist Health is a great way to pay for your eligible medical, dental, vision and pharmacy expenses. You can elect a debit card on MyFlexOnline.com under the Card Center tab . The card is good for up to 3 years if an election has been made for each plan year. Certain expenses do not require additional documentation while some do. Please see a few examples below to help better address when you need to send in documents f or verification. Services that do not require verification: -Doctor office co- pays -Prescriptions -ER co -pays Services that do require verification include but are not limited to: -Dental procedures -Glasses & Contacts -Major surgeries -Medical Equipment In the event that an expense is not eligible/overpayment has been made and the card has been used, we will adjust the claim to the correct dollar amount, and suspend the debit card until the balance is repaid. 6 WHEN PARTICIPATION ENDS Your participation ends as of the date one or more of the following occurs: Employment with the Company ends You are no longer eligible to participate (see ELIGIBILITY on page 4 ) When Participant fails to make contributions during an unpaid leave of absence or after termin ation of employment. (Special rules apply to a FMLA.) Date Participant revokes Election to Participate due to and consistent with a qualify election change event For the health and dependent care reimbursement account options, the January 1 following an enrollment period in which you do not elect to contribute to the account(s); however, if you have a balance in your account on the last day of the Plan Year, you may continue to participate through the grace period as applicable. The Plan is terminated IF YOU LEAVE THE COMPANY Upon termination you may stop making contributions and discontinue participation in the Cafeteria Plan. Only eligible expenses incurred before termination may be submitted during the year and until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year. If you return to service during the same Plan Year and elect to participate in the Plan, your former elections will be reinstated after prorating for the period you were not employed by a Participating Employer. If you return to service within 30 days of termination, you are required to resume participation at the same election in effect when you terminated. An alternative for the terminating participant is to continue making after -tax contributions for the Health Care Expense Reimbursement account, incurring eligible expenses for the remainder of the year, and submitting claims (until July 1) for services incurred during the Plan Year. You may continue to submit claims (until July 1) for eligible expenses incurred during the remainder of the year for the balance of your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account without making additional contributions. IF YOU DIE A beneficiary may file claims for eligible expenses incurred while you participated in the Cafeteria Plan (before your death). Your beneficiary must submit such claims by July 1 following the end of the Plan Year in which you were participating. FEDERAL RULES THAT APPLY TO REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTS Reimbursement accounts take advantage of federal laws that allow you to pay eligible health care and dependent care expenses with pretax dollars --that is, with money that has not been taxed. Since reimbursement accounts provide tax advantages, the IRS imposes certain restrictions on their use. The IRS requires that you use the money in your reim bursement accounts for expenses you incur during the Plan Year (or during the grace period if applicable) in which you are participating. The Plan Year ends on December 31; however, you have until July 1 of the 7 following year to request reimbursement for expenses incurred during the year. If you do not claim all of the money in your account by that date, the balance is forfeited. If you enroll in both reimbursement accounts, you may not transfer balances from one account to the other. Your Health Care E xpense Reimbursement Account balance remains totally separate from your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance. Once you enroll, you may not stop your payroll deductions or change the amount you contribute during the year unless you have a qu alifying election change event. You have 31 days from the date of the qualifying election change event to change your election. All election changes that you make are prospectively effective from the date the election change is made except in the case of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, for which election changes made within 30 days are effective the date of the event. This means that if you add a new dependent or spouse for reasons other than birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, only ex penses incurred after the date of the qualifying election change event are reimbursable under the Plan for the new dependent or spouse. For example, if you get married on June 1 and make an election to increase your Health Care Spending Account contributi on on June 15, only expenses incurred by your new spouse (and any other newly acquired dependents as a result of the marriage) on or after June 15 are reimbursable under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any expenses incurred by your spouse (or other newly acquired dependents) before June 15 will not be reimbursed under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT The Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account allows you to set aside pretax dollars, t hrough payroll deductions, to pay for qualifying health care expenses not reimbursed by any other health plan. As you or your spouse and qualifying dependents incur eligible health care expenses, you request reimbursement from your Health Care Expense Rei mbursement Account in tax -free dollars. For purposes of the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, qualifying dependents are defined by IRC \u00a7105(b) . Generally, this includes your legal spouse (as defined under federal law), your child(ren) and any qualifying relatives . Your child(ren) includes your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child or legally adopted child, regardless of such child's tax dependent status, marital status, employment status, student status or residency . Your child(ren) is eligible for coverage under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account until the end of the year in which he or she attains age 26. Other qualifying relatives may also be eligible. (See QUALIFYING RELATIVE section for a list of individuals who may be qualifying dependents.) CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT When you enroll in a Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, you choose how much you want deducted annually from your pay and redirected pretax into the account in your name. Y ou may elect to contribute up to $2, 600 per year to your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. The amount you choose is divided by the number of pay periods in the year and deducted on an equal pretax basis from each of your paychecks throughout the year. If your paycheck is less than the amount elected, you must pay any balance due by the first of the next month. Because of IRS rules, it is important to estimate your annual health care expenses carefully when determining the amount you wish to redi rect into your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Amounts not used for eligible expenses incurred during the coverage period, usually the Plan Year, are forfeited. (See the exception to this rule for QUALIFIED RESERVIST DISTRIBUTIONS, below .) 8 ELIG IBLE EXPENSES Most health care expenses not reimbursed by your or your spouse's medical, dental or vision plans can be reimbursed through your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, provided the service/item is received during the coverage period in which you are participating. (Payment date does NOT determine if or when the Plan may reimburse you for the expense.) You can be reimbursed for medical expenses incurred for you, your spouse or others claimed as dependents on your federal income tax return . IRS Code \u00a7213(d)(1) defines medical care as diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body. An expense which is merely beneficial to the general health of an indivi dual is NOT considered an expense for medical care. Eligible medical expenses include, but are not limited to: Deductibles Co-payments under medical, dental and vision plans Orthodontia-- Refer to flier detailing orthodontia reimbursement (available on Con nect) Mental health services in excess of health plan benefits Charges in excess of established usual and customary amounts, as determined under Company medical and dental plans Otherwise unreimbursed dental services (not cosmetic) Medical equipment Chirop ractic services, if to treat a specific medical condition Physical therapy Prescription drugs (qualifying drug or biological that legally requires physician's prescription Over-the-counter drugs and medicines if prescribed by a physician Smoking cessation programs and prescription drugs Insulin Podiatrist fees Support or corrective devices that are necessary for daily living Acupuncture fees Eye exams, eyeglasses, and contact lenses (not covered by a vision care program) Hearing exams and aids Meals, lodgin g and mileage while away from home for medical treatment (see below on how to file) Fees related to a weight -loss program. Cost of diet foods is not covered. (A copy of the physician prescription must accompany the ledger.) IMPORTANT: Effective January 1, 2011, federal law no longer allows expenses for over -the- counter drugs and medicines to be reimbursed from the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account unless prescribed by a physician. Eligible expenses must be incurred on or after your effective date of participation and must be substantiated by the provider of services. Generally, this means you must provide a third -party 9 receipt that shows: 1. The medical treatment, item or device received; 2. The date the expense was incurred; and 3. The amount of the expense. MEALS, LODGING, AND MILEAGE Expenses for transportation and related travel are reimbursable when you obtain medical care for yourself, your spouse, or a qualifying dependent at a location greater than 100 miles from your employing locati on. The travel expenses must be primarily for and essential to medical care. No significant element of personal pleasure, recreation or vacation may be contained in the travel expenses. (See QUAILIFYING RELATIVE section for a list of individuals who may be qualifying dependents.) You must submit substantiating documentation along with your reimbursement request in order for transportation and related travel to be considered an eligible medical expense. Such documentation must include: A letter from the referring physician indicating the name and location of the referred licensed healthcare facility and the name of the attending physician at that location. Original receipts for lodging, meals, public transportation (plane, train, etc .), and local transpo rtation (rental car, public transit, etc.) and fuel. If you use a vehicle other than a rental car, you must provide a contemporaneous mileage log showing the dates of travel, the travel origination and destination points, and the starting and ending odo meter readings of the vehicle you use. IRS limits the amount of travel costs for medical expense purposes to the following: Meals - only those eaten while en route to and from the medical treatment site Lodging - $50 per person per day Mileage - Rate as published by the Internal Revenue Service Persons covered - patient and one attendant if required for medical reasons Your reimbursement cannot exceed the amount of your annual salary redirection election for the Healthcare Expense Reimbursement Acc ount. EXPENSES NOT ELIGIBLE Examples of health care expenses that are not reimbursable by your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account include but are not limited to: Over -the-counter drugs and medicines that are not prescribed by a physician Health plan contributions Any expense reimbursed by a health, dental or vision plan Cosmetic surgery, unless medically necessary Marriage or family counseling Funeral or burial expenses 10 Household or domestic help, even if advised by your doctor Custodial care Massage therapy for general health Any expense incurred in connection with an illegal operation or treatment Health club fees Cosmetics, toiletries, toothpaste, slippers and other personal care items (e.g. shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, etc.) Medical expenses you itemize or for which you take a tax credit on your federal income tax return HOW YOU ARE REIMBURSED To request reimbursement for an eligible expense, submit electronically via MyFlexOnline, MyFlexM obile application, or a completed Expense Claim Form to Benefits Administration, PO Box 619031, Roseville, CA 95661- 9031. You must furnish documents such as itemized bills/invoices or computer printouts, or health plan Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for all expenses claimed. Payment of covered claims will be made to you by direct deposit or check up to the contribution amount you elected. You will only be reimbursed for eligible health expenses for which you have actually received service. No claims will be paid before the services are provided. Claims will b e processed every Tuesday and Thursday on a weekly basis. Claims must be in the Friday prior. If your claim is denied, you may file an appeal (see APPEAL OF DENIED CLAIMS section below). YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE You will receive periodic statements of your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance during the year. Review these statements carefully to help ensure that you use all of your contributions by year -end. REIMBURSEMENT DEADLINE You have until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year to subm it your reimbursement requests for the current Plan Year. Eligible health expenses include only those amounts for services/items received during the coverage period usually the Plan Year and the grace period discussed below, in which you participate in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any balance remaining after July 1 is forfeited. A \"grace period\" follows the end of the Plan Year for the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account for amounts you have allocated to your account that are unus ed at the end of the Plan Year. These amounts may be used to reimburse eligible health expenses incurred during the grace period. The grace period will begin on the first day of the subsequent Plan Year, January 1, and end on March 15. In order to take advantage of the grace period, you must be participating in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the last day of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates. For example, if the Plan Year ends December 31, 2018 , the grace period begins January 1, 2019 and ends March 15, 2019 . The following additional rules apply to the grace period: Eligible health expenses incurred during the grace period and approved for reimbursement will be paid first from amounts that were remaining at the end of the Plan Year to which the grace 11 period relates and then from any amounts that are available to reimburse expenses incurred during the current Plan Year. Remember, you may not use Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account amounts to reimburse health expenses. QUALIFIED RESERVIST DISTRIBUTION You may be able to receive a taxable distribution of amounts allocated to the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account that are unused in the event you are called to active duty if you meet the following criteria: You are a member of a \"reserve component\" (as defined in section 101 of title 37 of the United States Code), which means a member of the Army National Guard; the Reserve for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force or Coast Guard; Air National Guard of the United States; or the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service; You are called or ordered to active military duty for (i) 180 days or more or (ii) for an indefinite period; You provide a copy of your order or call to active duty; and You are a p articip ant in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the date you are called or ordered to duty. If you believe you are eligible for a Qualified Reservist Distribution, you must contact the Administrator of the Plan to request a distribution request fo rm as soon as possible. A request for a Qualified Reservist Distribution must be made in writing on the form provided by the Administrator of the Plan. You must submit a copy of your order or call to active duty along with your request. Requests for a Qualified Reservist Distribution must be made on or after the date of the order or call to duty but before the last day of the Plan Year (or grace period, if applicable) during which the order or call to duty occurred. You will receive your Qualified Reserv ist Distribution within a reasonable period of time, but no later than sixty (60) days after your request has been received. A Qualified Reservist Distribution will be made based on all salary reduction amounts credited to your Health Care Expense Reimbur sement Account for the applicable Plan Year that have not been applied to provide reimbursements submitted before the Qualified Reservist Distribution request is submitted. Claims incurred and submitted but not yet reimbursed at the time the Qualified Reservist Distribution Request is received will be treated like any other claim submitted for reimbursement under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account . The Administrator of the Plan will determine what this amount is on a uniform basis, consistent w ith applicabl e law and IRS interpretations. Unlike your reimbursements from your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account for eligible health expenses , the amount of your Qualified Reservist Distribution is taxed as income and will be reported as income on your W -2. Qualified Reservist Distributions do not apply to amounts in your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account . 12 DEPENDENT CARE EXPEN SE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT The Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account allows you to set aside pretax dollars , through payroll deductions, to pay for qualifying dependent care expenses. These expenses can include care for your children, disabled spouse or other qualifying dependent as defined in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \u00a7152. (See \"Qualifying Individual\" bel ow.) As you incur eligible dependent care expenses, you request reimbursement in tax -free dollars. NOTE: Dependent care expenses are eligible for reimbursement through your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account if they are necessary to enable you to be gainfully employed (you and your spouse if you are married). If your spouse is not employed, dependent care expenses will not be eligible, unless your spouse is a full -time student or is physically or mentally incapable of self -care. Additionally , if you are divorced or legally separated, you must be the custodial parent and need childcare in order for you to work. The IRS states that you must make the determination as to whether you are gainfully employed or in active search of gainful employment on a daily basis. Payments you make under a caregiver arrangement that requires you to pay for care during short, temporary absences will be qualified employment -related expenses. The IRS has established a period of two consecutive weeks or less as a safe harbor for short, temporary absences. The Administrator of the Plan may determine that longer periods of absence are short, temporary absences based on your facts and circumstances. In no situation will absences of 12 weeks under FMLA be deemed shor t, temporary absences. Part -time employees who are required to pay for care on a periodic basis, such as weekly or monthly, will be able to claim those payments as qualified employment -related expenses. CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSE REIMBURS EMENT ACCOUNT When you enroll in a Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account, you choose how much you want deducted annually from your pay and redirected into the account in your name. You may elect to contribute up to $5,000 per year. (If you are mar ried and filing separately, you may contribute up to $2,500 per year. See \"Limitations on Your Contributions\" below.) The amount you choose will be divided by the number of pay periods in the year and deducted on an equal pretax basis from each of your paychecks throughout the year. If your paycheck is less than the amount elected, you must pay any balance due by the first of the next month. Because of IRS rules, it is important to estimate your annual dependent care expenses carefully when determining the amount you choose to redirect into your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Amounts not used for qualifying dependent care during your coverage period are forfeited. LIMITATIONS ON YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS Your contributions to the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account cannot exceed the lesser of your annual earned income or that of your spouse. If your spouse is a full -time student or incapable of self -care, your spouse's monthly income will be considered to be $250 per month if you have one dependent or $500 per month for two or more dependents. 13 QUALIFYING INDIVIDUAL Must share the same principal place of abode with you for more than half the taxable year . An individual age 12 or under who is your \"qualifying child\" as defined in IRC \u00a7152(c). In general, a \"qualifying child\" is your child (including a brother, sister, step sibling) or a descendant of your child (e.g. a niece, nephew, grandchild) who does not provide over half of his or her own support A spouse who is physically or mentall y incapable of self -care A qualifying relative, as defined in IRC \u00a7 152, without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B), who is physically or mentally incapable of self -care and for whom you provide more than one- half of the individual's suppor t and is not your or another individual's qualifying child for the calendar year QUALIFYING RELATIVE Within the meaning of IRC \u00a7152(d), the following individuals qualify as dependents: 1.

Individual (other than a spouse) who, for the taxable year of the taxpayer, has as his principal place of abode during the entire tax year the home of the taxpayer and is a member of the taxpayer's household QUALIFYING DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES Reimbursable dependent care expenses are those servic es received and expenses incurred for the care of a qualifying individual in order for you (and your spouse if you are married) to be employed. WHO may PROVIDE services: A relative may provide dependent care services as long as he or she is not a dependent for whom you claim a deduction. Services may not be provided by: Your spouse or dependent Your spouse's dependent Your child under the age of 19 at the close of the calendar year The parent of your qualifying child; e.g. the noncustodial parent 14 WHERE services may be performed: In your home Outside your home - For the care of your dependent age 12 or under - For a Qualifying Individual who regularly spends at least eight ( 8) hours a day in your home ELIGIBLE EXPENSES include, but are not limited to, char ges from: A licensed child care center A nursery school In-home care for a child/spouse unable to care for him/her self Daytime summer camp (not educational) An adult day care center An adult private sitter, nanny or home care companion EXPENSES NOT ELIGIB LE Examples of dependent care expenses that are not reimbursable by your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account, as defined by the IRS, include, but are not limited to: Nursing home charges Kindergarten fees Schooling fees for children in the first grade and up Tuition Food, clothing, or transportation expenses Overnight camp Payments to a dependent you claim as an exemption for federal income tax purposes Expenses you deduct or for which you take a tax credit on your federal income tax return Presc hool fees when separate from childcare HOW YOU ARE REIMBURSED To request reimbursement from your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account for an eligible expense, submit electronically via MyFlexOnline, MyFlexMobile application, or submit a completed E xpense Claim Form to Benefits Administration, PO Box 619031, Roseville, CA 95661- 9031.

If you are married, provide a statement as to: - The amount of your spouse's earned income if less than $5,000 per calendar year - If your spouse is not employed, is - Spouse incapable of self -care - Spouse a full -time student attending classes at least five ( 5) months per calendar year Payment of covered claims will be made directly to you by direct deposit or check, up to the annual contribution amount you elected, but not to exceed the amount you have contributed to date. You will only be reimbursed for eligible dependent care expenses that have actually been incurred during your coverage period. No claims will be paid before the services are provided . The date you pay for your dependent care services DOES NOT determine when or if the Plan may reimburse you. If your claim is denied, you may file an appeal (A PPEAL OF DENIED CLAIMS section below). YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE You will receive periodic statements of your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance during the year. Review these statements carefully to help ensure that you use all of your contri butions by year -end. REIMBURSEMENT DEADLINE You have until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year to submit your reimbursement requests for the Plan Year. Eligible dependent care expenses include only those amounts for services received during the coverage period, usually the Plan Year and the grace period discussed below, in which you actively participate in the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any balance remaining after July 1 is forfeited. A \"grace period\" follows the end of the Plan Year for the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account for amounts you have allocated to your account that are unused at the end of the Plan Year. These amounts may be used to reimburse eligible dependent care expenses incurred during the grace period. The grace period will begin on the first day of the subsequent Plan Year, January 1, and end on March 15. In order to take advantage of the grace period, you must be participating in the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the last day of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates. For example, if the Plan Year ends December 31, 2018, the gra ce period begins January 1, 2019 and ends March 15, 2019 . The following additional rules apply to the grace period: Eligible dependent care expenses incurred during the grace period and approved for reimbursement will be paid first from amounts that were remaining at the end of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates and then from any amounts that are available to reimburse 16 expenses incurred during the current Plan Year. Remember, you may not use Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account amounts to reimburse dependent care expenses. AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO SAVE TAXES Using the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account is just one way you can receive a tax break for eligible dependent care expenses. The federal government also allows a tax credit called the household and dependent care credit for eligible dependent care expenses when you file your income tax return. The household and dependent care tax credit is an allowance for a percentage of your annual day care expenses as a credit against your federal income tax liability under the U.S. Tax Code. In determining what the tax credit would be, you may take into account only $2 ,400 of such expenses for one eligible dependent or $4 ,800 for two or more dependents. Depending on your adjusted gross income, the percentage could be as much as 35% of your eligible day care expenses to a maximum credit amount of $1,050 for one dependent or $2,100 for two or more dependents (to a minimum of 20% of eligible day care expenses). The maximum 35% must be reduced by 1% (but not below 20%) for each $2,000 portion (or any fraction of $2,000) of your adjusted gross income over $15,000. Tax credit limits may ch ange in future years. Visit the web site for the Internal Revenue Service at www.irs.gov for updates. You can use both the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account and the federal tax credit, provided you do not claim the same expenses for both.

Ensuring pat ient safety requires a \"cu lture of safety\" where the organization avoids assigning blame to individuals but inst ead focuses on process failures that lead to harm. Creating a \"culture of sa fety\" begins by building awarene ss. Mistakes are often t he result of multiple factors, not simply one individual's misstep. It is the philoso phy of this organization that safety is everyone's responsibility and therefore, m ust be a collaborative effort. Strong organizational leadership i s vital in developing and mai ntaining a culture of s afety. Such a culture encourages the internal reporting of medical errors and activel y engages clinicians a nd other staff in the design of remedial steps to preve nt future occurrences of these errors. A second majo r focus of a strong safety culture is on the preven tion of medical errors through t he prospective analysis and redesign of vulnerable patient care systems. L astly, healthcare organizatio ns must understand the importance of communicating with patients and families when unanticipated out comes occur. Encouraging the reporting of medic al errors is critical to the success of any patient safety effort. Reporting errors serves to: Hold leaders accountable for performance and patient safety. Provide information that leads to improved patient safety. Accountability is necessary to ensure the provis ion of adequate resources and support and fa cilitates a safety conscious culture that s tarts with senior management and pervades front line care providers. Information related to medical errors will enhance k nowledge ab out the causes of errors and their prevention. The purpose of this policy is to describe the underlying system s and processes utilized in the prevention of event triggers, detection of error precursors, and the correcti on of error causes. DEFINITIONS: Adverse Event - An injury resulting from a med ical intervention, or in other words, is not due to the underlying patient condition. Medical Error - Failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or t he use of a wro ng plan to achieve this aim.Page 1 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/cgi/ doc-gw.pl?ref=ahshnv:14124&display= documentSentinel Event - An unexpected occurrence invol ving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof. Serious injury specifically includes loss of limb or function. The phrase \"or the risk thereof\" includes any process variation fo r which a recurrence would car ry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. Unanticipated Outcome - A result that differs signifi cantly from what was anticipate d to be the result of a treatment or procedure. Patient Safety Practice - A type of process or structur e whose application reduces the probability of adverse events resulting from ex posure to the healthcare system across a range of diseases and procedures. AFFECTED DEPARTM ENTS/SERVICES: All Departments POLICY: COMPLIANCE - KEY ELEMENTS: A.PROMOTING A SAFETY -CONSCIOUS CULTURE In order to improve patient safety and reduce errors, an enviro nment shall be created and maintained in which we can learn from failure - a safe, non-punitive environm ent that supports candid discussion of errors, their causes, and ways to prevent them. This requires t he leadership and co mmitment of senior executives, medical, nursing, a nd clinical staff to create chan ge within our organization. This requires a \"Culture of Safety\" so that the likelihood of error is minimize d. 1. Framework a. Effective leadership is necess ary to facilitat e significant s afety improvements and promote safety aware ness. Senior leadersh ip will be active in l eading patient safety improvements. b. This organization advocates a c onceptual framework that suppo rts systemic change. Change will be far more productive in reduci ng medical errors t han will targ eting and punishing individual providers. c. Perfecting the practices of individual doctors, nurses, or ph armacists may not prevent most medical errors. Improving pa tient safety involves the coor dinated efforts of multiple members of the health care team. This focus on process es and systems rather than individuals is a vit al and necessary step in the id entification and prevention of medical errors. d. The risks associated with hosp italization are significant and the strategies for improvement in patient care are based on the trusting relations hip established between the patient and caregiver as we ll as the trust and respect deve loped between caregivers and hospital leaders. 2. Culture Change a. Culture is defined by how sta ff works together in ongoing eff orts to provide patient care. Four cultural traits comm on in the health care industry m ake reducing or preventing medical errors difficult: 1. Fear: Staff afraid of losing their job 2. Shame: Personal failure and professional pride may lead a sta ff member to feel that a \"good\" physician or nurse does not harm patientsPage 2 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/cgi/ doc-gw.pl?ref=ahshnv:14124&display= document3. Urgency: Staff may take shortc uts and bypass r outine systems in an effort to act as quickly as possible. 4. Arrogance: Labeling rules and regulations as bureaucracy b. To adopt a safety conscious cul ture that is bas ed on a non-pu nitive approach to reporting medical errors, the fi ve elements of human performanc e will be considered in an effort to identify barri ers and dispel myths: 1. All people make errors2. Error-prone situations are predictable, manageable, and preve ntable 3. Individual behavior is strongl y influenced by organizational, programmatic, and management performance 4. High levels of human performanc e can be achieved if right beh aviors are taught, encouraged, and reinforced 5. Undesirable events can be avoi ded by understanding and monito ring precursor conditions and applyi ng lessons learned from past and significant events. c. Leaders are educated regarding error management and committed to the goal of medical error reduction and, wher e possible, elimination. Build ing a clear leadership consensus for change is a top pri ority and fostering a patient safety climate a prevalent management theme. Hospital leaders promote patient safety aware ness by: 1. Demonstrating patient safety as a top leadership priority, al locating adequate resources and strategic support, including information systems and data management processes for measurin g, assessing, and improving pa tient safety; providing adequate personnel to participate in patient safety activities 2. Ensuring patient safety is interdisciplinary and coordinated and integrated throughout the organization 3. Promoting a non-punitive culture for sharing information and lessons learned 4. Conducting routine organizati on-wide assessments of the risk of error and adverse events in the care deliv ery process; all appropriate de partments and services will be included in th is assessment 5. Evaluating external best prac tices related to clinical care 6. Analyzing adverse events and var iations in performance or pro cesses that affect patient safety and id entifying trends across events 7. Providing recognition for re porting errors and safety-driven decision making 8. Considering information related to patient safety and unantic ipated outcomes in process planning for performance improvement priorities incl uding the design or redesign of proces ses, functions or services 9. Implementing care delivery process improvements which include minimal steps and handoffs, thereby avoiding reliance on memory 10. Engaging patients and families in providing feedback related to safety concerns including the patient's role in helping to facilitate the safe delivery of care and the patient's /family's responsibilit y for reporting pe rceived 3 of 6 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/cgi/ doc-gw.pl?ref=ahshnv:14124&display= document11.

DEFINITIONS: \"Demand \" is a component of the electronic staffing solution that calculates workl oad bas ed on patient turnover and when combined with Outcomes -Driven Acuity, factors in the pat ient's clinical condition and provides fluctuating staffing needs. AFFECTED DEPARTMENTS/SERVICES: All Patient Care Units POLICY: COMPLIANCE - KEY ELEMENTS A. GENERAL PARAMETERS Staffing Levels are determined for inpatient units by the \"Demand\" hours calculated based on the acuity of each admitted patient and any pending Admit / Discharge / Transfer activity. The Staffing assignment is prepared by the charge nur se/shift leader or designee. Acuity levels are based on the patient's clinical condition and care needs. They are calculated from clinical documentation entered by staff throughout the shift. Acuity data is validated through audits conducted by Patient Outcomes Experts on each unit. All staffing mixes are reviewed by the Charge Nurse/Shift Lead and/or Supervisor in order to verify that the needs of the patients and personnel are being met. Patient acuity level fluctuates throughout the shift based on docum entation. Assignments may be adjusted to create balance across the unit. B. ADDITIONAL STAFFING FACTORS Factors that are taken into consideration when developing staffing plans include: 1. Staffing solution provided \"Demand\" hours based on the patients' acuit y. 2. Unit Census 3. Expertise and mix of available staff 4. Geographical layout of the unit(s) 5. Isolation precautions Policy: Staffing Assignment by Policy No. PCM I. 15 Acuity Page 2 of 2 6. Other complex events requiring additional time on the unit. Example, sitter, RRT or code. C. PROCEDURE 1. Prior to the beginning of each shift, as signments are made by the Charge Nurse or designee based on acuity and patient needs. 2. Nurse assignments are documented in the electronic staffing solution, including any break coverage provided (relief). Assignments of devices and other unit duties may al so be documented in the electronic staffing solution. 3. Events requiring a higher level or commitment of nursing intervention may also be documented in the staffing solution if the activities require staff to be consumed in a one- to-one or higher staff to patient ratio. The events require documenting a start and stop time, and the time will be calculated into the required patient care hours for the shift.

DEFINITIONS: AFFEC TED DEPARTMENTS/SERVICES: All Patient Care Units POLICY: COMPLIANCE - KEY ELEMENTS A. POLICY All delivery of nursing care to patients is assigned by and under the supervision of registered nurses. B. PROCEDURE 1. Staffing plans are based on the assessed needs of the patients served at the hospital. Ongoing reevaluation of the staffing plan is made by RNs, and changes are designed and implemented as required. Nursing employees are members of the multidisciplinary treatment team. 2. All nursing personnel are under the supervision of RNs on all shifts. The nursing employees are under the direct supervision of the Nursing Coordinator of Inpatient Services who reports to the Director of Patient Services (Director of Nursing). The Director of Patient Services (Director of Nursing) is accountable to the medical staff and to hospital administration for the quality of patient care provided. 3. The total number of nursing employees assigned to a unit is determined by: a. The total number of patients. b. The ability of each of the patients to meet their own self -care needs, and the amount of assistance required by individual patients to meet their own needs, and to function safely and effectively on the unit. c. The level of acuity of individual patients, and the overall level of ac uity of the patient population as a whole. d. The needs of individual patients for special assistance, supervision, or intervention such as special precautions (for suicide risk, elopement risk, poor impulse control, 1:1 supervision, etc.). Policy: Acuity / Staffing Plans Policy No. PCM I. 15 Page 2 of 2 4. The skill mix an d level of licensure of employees assigned to a specific unit will be based on the complexity and intensity of the needs of the patients being served. a. A minimum of one RN is assigned to the adult unit, and one RN is assigned to the child / adolescent serv ice on all shifts. b. A minimum of two employees must be on each unit at all times when patients are present. NOTE: When children occupy Unit 4 and adolescents occupy Unit 3, the two units that share contiguous space are staffed collectively by a minimum of 1 employee for each unit, for a total of 2. At least one employee must be a RN. Each employee must be physically on their unit. 5. The staffing plan is based on the presumption of a commonly high level of patient acuity, a predominant pattern of short lengt hs of stay, frequent admissions and discharges, and rapid changes in the mental status and behavior of our patients. 6. A gender mix will be attempted on all shifts. During the night hours, at least one female employee must be present whenever there are female patients present. During the day, careful discretion is used in determining when to leave a male employee alone with female patients. 7. The basic unit staffing patterns (core staffing plans) are based on the budgeted average daily census, which is determ ined by past experience, plus an ongoing assessment of community needs and trends with the communities served. NOTE: The actual staffing plan for each unit is per matrix. The matrix is found in the senior charge staffing book, located in the staffing coor dinator's office during daytime and in the nursing Supervisor's office after regular office hours. 8. The assignment of additional employees will be triggered by an assessment of increased levels of acuity related to demonstrated patient behaviors including, but not limited to, combativeness, acutely self -destructive behaviors, and other forms of highly volatile, psychotic, resistive, or antisocial behaviors. In consultation with the Director of Patient Services (Director of Nursing), the Nursing Coordinator of Inpatient Services / designee will make decisions about the need for additional personnel. 9. Staffing patterns will be adjusted as needed to provide for the safety of the patients and personnel and to support a therapeutic environment.

Ensuring patient safety requires a \"culture of safety\" where the organization avoids assigning blame to individuals. Creating a \"culture of safety\" begins by building awareness. Mistakes are often the result of multiple factors, not simply one individual's misstep. It is the philosophy of this organization that safety is everyone's responsibility and therefore, must be a collaborative effort. Strong organizational leadership is v ital in developing and maintaining a culture of safety. Such a culture encourages the internal reporting of medical errors and actively engages clinicians and other staff in the design of remedial steps to prevent future occurrences of these errors. A second major focus of a strong safety culture is on the prevention of medical errors through the prospective analysis and redesign of vulnerable patient care systems. Lastly, healthcare organizations must understand the importance of communicating with pati ents and families when unanticipated outcomes occur. Encouraging the reporting of medical errors is critical to the success of any patient safety effort. Reporting errors serves to: Hold leaders accountable for performance and patient safety. Provide information that leads to improved patient safety. Accountability is necessary to ensure the provision of adequate resources and support and facilitates a safety conscious culture that starts with senior management and pervades front line care providers. I nformation related to medical errors will enhance knowledge about the causes of errors and their prevention. The purpose of this policy is to describe the underlying systems and processes utilized in the prevention of event triggers, detection of error pr ecursors, and the correction of error causes. DEFINITIONS: Adverse Event : An injury resulting from a medical intervention, or in other words, is not due to the underlying patient condition. Medical Error: Failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or the use of a wrong plan to achieve this aim. Sentinel Event: An unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof. Serious injury specifically includes loss of limb or function. The phras e \"or the risk thereof\" includes any process variation for which a recurrence would carry a significant chance of a serious adverse outcome. Unanticipated Outcome : A result that differs significantly from what was anticipated to be the result of a treatm ent or procedure. Policy: Patient Safety - An Policy No. PCM I. 8 Organizational Approach Page 2 of 5 Patient Safety Practice: A type of process or structure whose application reduces the probability of adverse events resulting from exposure to the healthcare system across a range of diseases and procedures. AFFECTED DEPARTMENTS/SERVI CES: All Departments POLICY: COMPLIANCE - KEY ELEMENTS A. PROMOTING A SAFETY -CONSCIOUS CULTURE In order to improve patient safety and reduce errors, an environment shall be created and maintained in which we can learn from failure - a safe, non- punitive environment that supports candid discussion of errors, their causes, and ways to prevent them. This requires the leadership and commitment of senior executives, medical, nursing, and clinical staff to create change within our organization. This requires a \"Culture of Safety\" so that the likelihood of error is minimized. 1. Framework a. Effective leadership is necessary to facilitate significant safety improvements and promote safety awareness. Senior leadership will be active in leading patient safety improv ements. b. This organization advocates a conceptual framework that supports systemic change. Change will be far more productive in reducing medical errors than will targeting and punishing individual providers. c. Perfecting the practices of individual doctor s, nurses, or pharmacists may not prevent most medical errors. Improving patient safety involves the coordinated efforts of multiple members of the health care team. This focus on processes and systems rather than individuals is a vital and necessary ste p in the identification and prevention of medical errors. d. The risks associated with hospitalization are significant and the strategies for improvement in patient care are based on the trusting relationship established between the patient and caregiver as well as the trust and respect developed between caregivers and hospital leaders. 2. Culture Change a. Culture is defined by how staff works together in ongoing efforts to provide patient care. Four cultural traits common in the health care industry make reduc ing or preventing medical errors difficult: 1) Fear: Staff afraid of losing their job 2) Shame: Personal failure and professional pride may lead a staff member to feel that a \"good\" physician or nurse does not harm patients 3) Urgency : Staff may take shortcuts an d bypass routine systems in an effort to act as quickly as possible. Policy: Patient Safety - An Policy No. PCM I. 8 Organizational Approach Page 3 of 5 4) Arrogance: Labeling rules and regulations as bureaucracy b. To adopt a safety conscious culture that is based on a non- punitive approach to reporting medical errors, the five elements of human performance will be considered in an effort to identify barriers and dispel myths: 1) All people make errors 2) Error- prone situations are predictable, manageable, and preventable 3) Individual behavior is strongly influenced by organizational, programmatic, and management performance 4) High levels of human performance can be achieved if right behaviors are taught, encouraged, and reinforced 5) Undesirable events can be avoided by understanding and monitoring precursor conditions and applying lessons learned from p ast and significant events. c. Leaders are educated regarding error management and committed to the goal of medical error reduction and, where possible, elimination. Building a clear leadership consensus for change is a top priority and fostering a patient safety climate a prevalent management theme. Hospital leaders promote patient safety awareness by: 1) Demonstrating patient safety as a top leadership priority, allocating adequate resources and strategic support , including information systems and data management processes for measuring, assessing, and improving patient safety; providing adequate personnel to participate in patient safety activities 2) Ensuring patient safety is interdisciplinary and coordinated and integrated throughout the organization 3) Promot ing a non- punitive culture for sharing information and lessons learned 4) Conducting routine organization- wide assessments of the risk of error and adverse events in the care delivery process; all appropriate departments and services will be included in this assessment 5) Evaluating external best practices related to clinical care 6) Analyzing adverse events and variations in performance or processes that affect patient safety and identifying trends across events 7) Providing recognition for reporting errors and safety -driven decision making 8) Considering information related to patient safety and unanticipated outcomes in process planning for performance improvement priorities including the design or redesign of processes, functions or services 9) Implementing care delivery process improvements which include minimal steps and handoffs, thereby avoiding reliance on memory 10) Engaging patients and families in providing feedback related to safety concerns including the patient's role in helping to Policy: Patient Safety - An Policy No. PCM I. 8 Organizational Approach Page 4 of 5 facilitate the safe delivery of care and the patient's/family's responsibility for reporting perceived risk to their care. 11) Measuring the effectiveness of leadership's contributions to improving patient safety B. ERROR MANAGEMENT 1. Vulnerable Patient Care Areas, Systems, and Safety Practices a. Ongoing monitoring related to patient safety processes will include the following high- risk areas/systems/practices: 1) Physical hospital environment 2) Medical Equipment 3) Patient care areas 4) Infection control practices 5) Medication practices 6) Surgery 7) Anesthesia 8) Transfusion practices 9) Staffing coverage and competency related to patient safety 2. Approach to Medical Error Management a. Addressing medical errors involves the following steps: 1) Prevention of event triggers a) The goal of medical error management is to eliminate, substantially reduce, or prevent future occurrence of medical errors b) Education of staff at all levels related to error prevention techniques is essential c) Establishing an accountability system will instill behavior consistent with goal of medical error management 2) Detection of error precursors a) Hospital leaders will oversee activities related to performance trending, performance monitoring, and actions taken to change performance b) The information contained in Sentinel Event Alerts will be widely communicated and discussed with consideration given to implementation of recommendations contained in Sentinel Event Alerts; when recommendations are not implemented, justification for so doing will be documented. c) Prospective analysis and redesign of vulnerable pati ent care systems will occur as appropriate; a proactive risk assessment of one high- risk patient safety process will be done annually Policy: Patient Safety - An Policy No. PCM I. 8 Organizational Approach Page 5 of 5 d) Prompt reporting of medical errors will be encouraged; a medical error reporting system will be utilized as the mechanism for communication and reporting of events; this includes \"no harm\" occurrences as well as unanticipated outcomes and sentinel events. e) Immediate response to a medical error will include care of the affected person(s), containment of risk to others, and pres ervation of factual information for subsequent analysis; support will be provided to staff members. f) Sentinel events will be managed according to hospital policy 3) Correction of error will involve utilizing root cause analysis to determine human, organizational, and program failures and identify management issues a) Measurement and analysis of critical steps in at least one actual process identified as error -prone high- risk will be done to determine the degree of variation from intended performance 4) Disclosure of Unanticipated Outcomes will be managed per Disclosure of Unanticipated Outcomes Policy. Because of the need to consider the effect the medical error has on the patient's medical condition, further treatment, and current hospitalization, the attending physician, or consulting physician in certain situations, is the most appropriate responsible party for discussing unanticipated outcomes with the patient, family or legally authorized representative. Even in situations in which a hospital employee has com mitted the error, the physician is better suited to respond to questions from the patient and family. Hospital leaders will monitor all Unanticipated Outcomes to ensure appropriate communication with patient and family. C. COMMUNICATION / REPORTING OF PATIE NT SAFETY ACTIVITIES 1. Hospital leadership will oversee patient safety activities. Other leadership may include medical staff, hospital Safety Officer, Risk Manager, Quality Manager, Pharmacy Director, and Infection Control Nurse as appropriate. Other managers may be included when appropriate. 2. Patient safety activities and outcomes will be reported to the Safety Committee, Medical Executive Committee and Governing Board.

Email: complaint@jointcommission.org 07/22/2013 5 notified as required by county, state and federal laws (See: A ttachments). Each patient is provided with a written statement of patient rights and a notic e of privacy practices. These statements conform to all applicable state and federal laws, in cluding but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability act of 1996 (he reinafter referred to as HIPAA). These policies are available through UVMC intranet. Patient Information We are committed to ensuring confidentiality of records and rel ated information for all patients. Consistent with HIPAA, we do not use, disclose or dis cuss patient-specific information, including patient financial information, with othe rs unless it is necessary to serve the patient or required by law. UVMC Staff must never use or disclose confidential information that violates the privacy rights of our patients. In accordance with our privacy and secu rity policies and procedures, which reflect HIPAA requirements, no UVMC Staff has a right to any patient information other than that necessary to perform his or her job or responsi bilities. Any breach of confidentiality represents a fail ure to meet the professional a nd ethical standards expected, and constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct. A full confidentiality statement is received and accepted by each employee as part of the Employee Handbook . We also expect our vendors involved in patient care to perform and provide services consistent with the applicable HIPAA laws. We include HIPAA Bus iness Associate language in our agreements with these vendors. Emergency Treatment We follow the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) in providing an emergency medical screening examination and necessary stabil ization to all patients, regardless of ability to pay. Provided we have the capacity and capability, anyone with an emergency medical condition is tr eated. In an emergency situati on or if the patient is in labor, we will not delay the medical screening and necessary st abilization treatment in order to seek financial and demographic information. We do not admit, discharge, or transfer a patient with an emerg ency medical condition simply b ased on their ability or inability to pay or any other discriminatory factor. A patient with an emergency medical condition is only transferr ed to another facility at the patient's request or if the patien t's medical needs cannot be met at UVMC and appropriate care is knowingly available at another facility. Patients are o nly transferred in strict compliance with state and federal EMTALA regulatory and statuto ry requirements. Our Responsibilities to and with our Physicians Healthcare services like those owned and operated by UVMC are a collaboration between UVMC Staff and UVMC Medical Staff members. As in any collaborat ion, each party has important roles and responsibilities. UVMC is committed to providing an excellent work environment for UVMC Medical Staff. UVMC Staff interacts with U VMC Medical Staff members in a respectful and supporting way. We require UVMC Med ical Staff members to be familiar with this Code of Conduct. UVMC Medical Staff are g overned by Medical Staff Rules and Regulations. 07/22/2013 6 a. Interactions with Physicians: Federal and state laws and regulations govern the relationship between hospitals and physicians who may refer patients to UVMC. The applicable feder al laws include the Anti-Kickback Law and the Stark Law. It is important that UVMC Staff who interact with physicians (particularly those UVMC Staff who make payments to physicians for services rendered, provide space or services to physicians, rec ruit physicians to the community, and/or arrange for physicians to serve in leadership positions in the organization) are aware of the requirements of the laws, regula tions, and policies that address relationships between UVMC and physicians. If relations hips with physicians are properly structured, but not diligently administered, such failure to administer the arrangements as agreed results in a violation of the law. Any a rrangement with a physician must be structured to ensure compliance with legal re quirements. Most arrangements must be in writing and approved by the Compliance Department. Failure to meet all requirements of these laws and regulations can resu lt in serious consequences for UVMC. b. We do not pay for referrals . We accept patient referral and admissions based solely on the patient's medical needs and our ability to render the needed services. We do not pay or offer to pay anyone - staff, physicians, or other persons or entities - for the refer ral of patients. c. We do not accept payments for referrals we make. No UVMC Staff member or any other person acting on behalf of UV MC, is permitted to solicit or receive anything of value, directly or indirectly, i n exchange for the referral of patients. Similarly, when making patient referrals to another h ealthcare provider, we do not take into account the volume or value of referrals that the provider has made to AH. d. We do not Extend Business Courtesies and/or Tokens of Apprec iation to Potential Referral Sources, Outside of the UVMC Policies . Any entertainment, gift or token of appreciation involving phys icians or other persons who are in a position to refer patients to UVMC must be underta ken in accordance with UVMC policies. These policies were developed to be in complian ce with federal laws, regulations, and rules regarding these practices. UVMC Staff mu st consult UVMC policies or our Compliance Department prior to extending any bu siness courtesy or token of appreciation to a potential referral source. Our Responsibilities to Ensure Legal and Regulatory Compliance UVMC provides many types of healthcare services. These services are provided pursuant to appropriate federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and federal conditions of participation. Such laws, regulations, and conditions of partic ipation may include, but are not limited to, subjects such as certificates of need, licenses , permits, accreditations, access to treatment, consent to treatment, medical record-keepi ng, access to medical records and confidentiality, patients' rights, clinical research, end of life care decision making, and Medicare and Medicaid program requirements. The org anization is subject to 07/22/2013 7 other numerous laws in addition to these healthcare laws, regul ations, and the conditions of participation. UVMC has developed policies and procedures to address many lega l, accreditation, certification and regulatory requirements. However, it is impra ctical to develop policies and procedures that encompass the full body of applicable law, stan dards, conditions and regulations. Such laws, standards, conditions and regulations n ot covered in organizational policies and procedures must still be followed. There is a rang e of expertise within UVMC, including operations counsel and numerous functional experts, w ho should be consulted for advice concerning human resources, legal regulations and st atutes, established standards and applicable conditions of participation. Anyone aware of violations or suspected violations of laws, reg ulations, standards and the conditions of participation, or UVMC policies and procedures mu st report them immediately. There are many individuals to whom UVMC Staff may voice such concerns including supervisors, any member of the UVMC Leadership Team, the Vice President of Human Resources, the Compliance Officer, the Compliance Departm ent, the Adventist Health Compliance Officer or Compliance hotline. Accreditation and Surveys From time to time, government agencies and other entities condu ct surveys at UVMC. Accreditation or external agency surveys are extremely signific ant and broader than the scope of this Code of Conduct. In preparation for, during and after surveys, UVMC Staff must comply with all accrediting and external agency surveyors in a direct, open and honest manner and with accurate information. In preparation for, or during a survey or inspection, UVMC Staf f must never conceal, destroy, or alter any documents, lie; or make misleading statem ents to the agency representative. Also, UVMC Staff must never attempt to cause an other staff member to fail t o p r o v i d e a c c u r a t e i n f o r m a t i o n o r o b s t r u c t , m i s l e a d , o r d e l a y the communication of information or records relating to a possible violation of law. No action should ever be taken, directly or indirectly, to mislead the accrediting or ex ternal agency survey teams. Federal and State False Claims Acts Federal and State False Claims Acts prohibit any person or enti ty from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a fal se or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, or knowingly making or using, or causing t o made or used, a false record or statement to get a fal se or fraudulent claim paid or approved. The penalties for violating the Federal or State False Claims A ct include: x Civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each false claim submitted; x Up to three times the amount of damages the government sustai ns because of the false claim; and, x The costs of the legal action brought to recover for the false claim. A private citizen may file suit under the Federal and State Fal se Claims Acts on behalf of the government if the citizen has direct and independent knowle dge of the submission of a 07/22/2013 8 false claim. The government will then decide whether to interve ne and take over the case, dismiss or settle the case, or l et the private individual pursu e the case on his or her own. In either case, the person who initia lly filed the case may receiv e a portion of the amount recovered in either litigation or settlement of the claim. Whistleblower Protections Both the Federal and State Fals e Claims Acts prohibit employers from retaliating or discriminating against an employee who, acting in good faith, i nvestigates, reports or assists in uncovering a false claim or statement. An employee who suffers discrimination or retaliation based on protected activities has the right to sue under the both the Federal and State False Claims Act. If the employee can prove that his or her employer retaliated against him or her fo r engaging in protected activi ty, the employee is entitled to be \"m ade whole.\" The remedies may include: x Reinstatement of the employee to his or her position; x Two times the amount of back pay; x Interest on the back pay; and, x Compensation for any special damages (including litigation cos ts and reasonable attorneys' fees). As noted above, it is the policy of Adventist Health and its Af filiates that no employee shall be punished solely on the basis that he or she reported what he or she reasonably believed to be an act of wrongdo ing or a violation of the Adven tist Health Corporate Compliance Program. Your local compliance officer can provide more detailed informa tion regarding the protections afforded employees under the Federal and State Fals e Claims Acts. Our Responsibilities in Safegua rding Business and Financial Information Accuracy, Retention, and Disposal of Documents and Records Each UVMC Staff member is responsible for the integrity and acc uracy of our organization's documents and records, not only to comply with regulatory and leg al requirements, but also to ensure that records are available to support our business practices and actions. No one may alter or falsify information on any record or document. Records must never be destroyed in an effort to deny government al authorities information that may be relevant to a government investigation. Medical and business documents and records are retained in acco rdance with the law and our record retention policy. Medical and business documents inc lude paper documents such as letters and memos, computer-based information such as e -mail or computer files on disk or tape, and any other medium that contains information about the organization or its business activities. It is important to retain and destroy records only according with our policy. UVMC Staff must not tamper with records. No one may rem ove or destroy records 07/22/2013 9 prior to the specified date without first obtaining permission as outlined in the UVMC records management policy. Coding and Billing for Services We communicate our billing policies to all our patients prior t o, or, at the time of service or admission. We bill our patients for services rendered and provi de itemized bills free of charge upon request. Our patient financial services office resp onds to patient questions in a timely and courteous manner. We perform annual audits to ensu re the accuracy of our bills. We make adjustments to correct any over or under billing s. We have implemented policies, procedures and systems to facilit ate accurate billing to our government payers, commercial insurance payers, and patients. T hese policies, procedures, and systems conform to pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. We prohibit any UVMC Staff member from knowingly presenting or cau sing to be presented claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious, or f raudulent. In support of accurate billing, medical records must provide re liable documentation of the services we provided. It is important that all individuals who contribute to the medical record provide accurate information and do not destroy any info rmation considered part of the official medical record. Accurate and timely documentation also depends on the diligence and attention of physicians who treat patients in our facilities. We expect physicians to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner. Confidential Information: The term \"confidential information\" refers to proprietary information about our organization's strategies and operations as well as patient information and third party information. Improper use or disclosure of confidential informa tion could violate legal and ethical obligations. UVMC Staff may use confidential informatio n only to perform their job responsibilities. We do not share this information with others unless the individuals, entities, and/or contractual business relationships have a legi t i m a t e n e e d t o k n o w . Consistent with HIPAA, we do not use, disclose or discuss patie nt specific information, including patient financial information, with others unless it is necessary to serve the patient or required by law . Any breach of confidentiality represents a failure to meet the professional and ethical standards expected, and constitutes a violation of this Code of Conduct. A full confidentiality statement is received and acce pted by each employee as part of the UVMC Employee Handbook. Cost Reports We are required by federal and state laws and regulations to su bmit certain reports outlining our operating costs and statistics. We comply with fe deral and state laws, regulations, and guidelines relating to all cost reports. These laws, regulations, and guidelines define what costs are allowable and outline the appr opriate methodologies we may use to claim reimbursement for the cost of services provide d. All issues related to the preparation, submission and settlemen t of cost reports must be performed in accordance with the Adventist Health Cost Reportin g Program Policies and Procedures. 07/22/2013 10 Electronic Medical and Security Requirements All communication systems, including but not limited to compute rs, electronic mail, Intranet, Internet access, telephones, and voice mail, are the property of the organization and are to be used primarily for business purposes in accordanc e with electronic communication policies and procedures. Limited reasonable perso nal use of UVMC communication systems is permitted; however, users should assum e these communications are not private. Users of computer and telephone s y s t e m s s h o u l d presume no expectation of privacy in anything they create, stor e, send, or receive on UVMC computer and telephone systems, and UVMC reserves the righ t to monitor and/or access communication usage and content consistent with our poli cies and procedures. UVMC Staff who abuse our communication systems or use them exce ssively for non- business purposes may lose these privileges and be subject to d isciplinary action. UVMC Staff must comply with UVMC 's information security policies and standards governing the use of our information systems. User IDs and pass words are assigned to an individual. UVMC Staff are not permitted to share or disclose any password that is used to access UVMC 's systems or information. Financial Reporting and Records UVMC maintains a high standard of accuracy and completeness in documenting, managing, and reporting financial information. This information serves as a basis for managing our business and is important in meeting our obligatio ns to patients, staff, suppliers, and others. It is also necessary for compliance with tax and financial reporting requirements. All financial information must reflect actual transactions and conform to generally-accepted accounting principles. All funds or assets must be properly rec orded. UVMC maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance tha t all transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and are recorded in a proper manner to maintain accountability of the assets. Intellectual Property Rights and Obligations Any work of authorship, inventions, or other creation created b y a staff member during the scope of his or her employment with UVMC shall be considered th e property of UVMC, including any patent, trademark, c opyright, trade secret or oth er intellectual property right. Our Responsibilities to Our UVMC Staff Conflict of Interest A conflict of interest may occur if a UVMC Staff 's outside activities, personal financial interest, or other private interest interfere or appear to inte rfere with his or her ability to make objective decisions in the course of his or her job respon sibilities. Conflicts of interest also arise when a UVMC Staff member or a member of his or her f amily receives improper benefits as a result of his or her position in UVMC. UVMC Staf f are obligated to ensure 07/22/2013 11 they remain free of conflicts of interest in the performance of their responsibilities at UVMC. Clinical decisions are made without regard to compensatio n or personal financial benefit to UVMC leaders, managers, clinical staff, or licensed independent practitioners. You are encouraged to raise any questions involving this policy with the Vice President for Human Resources or the Compliance Department before becoming en gaged in outside activities or relationships that may give rise to an actual or perceived conflict. If UVMC Staff do become involved in a transaction where persona l interests conflict with UVMC 's interests, they are required to disclose that conflict to a supervisor, th e Human Resources Department or the Compliance Department. UVMC Board m embers, executives, and directors are required to sign a Conflict of In terest Statement in accordance with the UVMC Conflict of Interest Policy. No waiver of this conflict of interest provision may be granted unless approved in advance by the Compliance Committee. Controlled Substances/ Drug and Alcohol Free Workplace The dangers of drug and/or alcohol abuse are numerous, includin g the risks of loss of life, physical damage to people and property, a decline in morale and productivity, and deterioration in the quality of goods and services produced. Ou r policy is to maintain a drug/alcohol-free workplace. Thus, the unlawful manufacture, di stribution, dispensing, possession or use of a controlled substance or alcohol is prohi bited in our workplace. All UVMC Staff must report for work free of the influence of alcoho l and illegal drugs. Any UVMC Staff member who reports to work under the influence of an y illegal drug or alcohol, has an illegal drug in his or her system, or who uses, possesse s, or sells illegal drugs while on UVMC work time or property may be terminated immediately. We may use drug testing as a means of enforcing this policy. Some of our staff routinely have access to prescription drugs, controlled substances, and other medical supplies. Many of these substances are governed a nd monitored by specific regulatory organizations and must be administered by physician order only. Prescription and controlled medications and supplies must be handled properl y and only by authorized individuals to minimize risks to UVMC and to patients. Any UVMC Staff member who becomes aware of inadequate security of drugs or controlled sub stances or the diversion of drugs from the organization must report it immediately. As a condition of continued employment, UVMC Staff are expected and required to abide by this policy and to notify their department manager of any cr iminal drug/alcohol statute conviction against them no later than 5 calendar days after suc h conviction. A conviction means a finding of guilt, including a plea of nolo contender or imposition of a sentence or both by any judicial body charged with the responsibility to de termine violations of the federal or state criminal drug/ alcohol statutes. Diversity and Equal Employment Opportunity UVMC actively promotes diversity in its workforce at all levels of the organization. We are committed to providing an inclusive work environment where ever yone is treated with fairness, dignity, and respect. We are accountable to each othe r for the manner in which we treat one another and for the manner in which people around us are treated. We are 07/22/2013 12 committed to recruiting and retaining a diverse staff that is r eflective of the patients and community we serve. We regard laws, regulations and policies re lating to diversity as a minimum standard. We strive to create and maintain a setting in which we celebrate cultural and other differences and consider them strengths. UVMC maintains an equal opportunity workforce and no one shall unlawfully discriminate against any individual with regard to race, color, religion, ge nder, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or veteran stat us with respect to any offer, or term or condition, of employment. We make reasonable accommodat ions to the known physical and mental limitation of qualified individuals with di sabilities. Harassment and Disruptive Behavior UVMC seeks to provide a work environment that is free of all fo rms of discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment and disruptive behavior . Prohibited forms of discriminatory harassment include, but are not limited to, oral , physical or visual harassment. UVMC considers unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, remarks or jokes of a sexual nature, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature to constitute sexual harassment when: I. submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or impl icitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; II. employment decisions concerning an individual are based on whether the person submitted to or rejected the harassing action; and/or III. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably int erfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment \u2014even where it leads to no tangible or economic job consequences . We strongly disapprove of discriminatory harassment in any form . We do not tolerate harassment by anyone based on the cultural backgrounds of those who work with us. Degrading or humiliating jokes, s lurs, intimidations, or other harassing conduct is not acceptable in our workplace. Sexual harassment is considered t o be sex discrimination in violation of applicable state and federal law subjecting the ha rassing employee to legal liability. UVMC Staff who observe or experience any form of alleged discri mination, discriminatory harassment or violence should be reported to either a departmen t head or the Human Resources department. The law protects UVMC Staff from any reta liation for reporting or participating in the investigation of discrimination or discrim inatory harassment. A prompt and thorough investigation of the alleged incident will be cond ucted. To the extent possible, the investigation and any subsequent action will proc eed in an atmosphere of confidentiality. We will take all appropriate steps to enforce this policy, including termination or other disciplinary action, against persons who h ave violated this policy. UVMC Staff who have submitted a complaint of discrimination or discriminatory harassment addressed under this policy should immediately make a further complaint if the discrimination or discrimina tory harassment resumes. 07/22/2013 13 Health and Safety UVMC complies with all workplace health and safety rules and re gulations. Our policies and practices are designed to protect our staff from potential workplace hazards. UVMC Staff need to be familiar with these policies and how they appl y t o t h e i r s p e c i f i c j o b responsibilities. Each staff member should seek advice from his or her supervisor, or the hospital's Safety Officer, whenever he/she has a question or concern. It is important that each staff member immediately advise a supervisor or the Safety Officer of any serious workplace injury or any situation presenting a danger of injury . Immediate notification allows for timely corrective actions. Environmental Compliance It is UVMC policy to comply with all environmental laws and reg ulations as they relate to UVMC 's operations. We act to preserve our natural resources to the full extent reasonably possible. UVMC complies with all environmental laws and operate s its facilities with the necessary permits, approvals, and controls. We diligently emplo y the proper procedures to provide a good environment of care and to prevent pollution. In helping UVMC comply with these laws and regulations, all UVM C Staff must understand how job duties may impact the environment. Staff must adhere to all requirements for the proper handling of hazardous material, and immediately alert su pervisors to any situation regarding the discharge of a hazardous substance, improper disp osal of hazardous and medical waste, or any situation that may be potential damaging to the environment. Hiring of Former and Current Government and Medicare Administra tive Contractor Employees The recruitment and employment of former or current U.S. govern ment employees may be impacted by regulations concerning conflicts of interest. Hirin g employees directly from a Medicare Administrative Contracto r requires certain regulatory notifications. Staff should consult with the Human Resources Department or the Compliance D epartment regarding such recruitment and hiring. Ineligible Persons We do not contract with, employ, or bill for services rendered by any individual or entity: (1) that is excluded or inelig ible to participate in federal he althcare programs; (2) that was suspended or debarred from federal government contracts and not reinstated in a federal healthcare program after a period of exclusion, suspension, deb arment, or ineligibility; or (3) has been convicted of a criminal offense that falls within the scope of 42 U.S.C. 1320a- 7(a), but has not yet been excluded, debarred, suspended or oth erwise declared ineligible (each, an \"Ineligible Person\") . Upon hire we search the Department of Health and Human Services ' Office of Inspector General, Exclusive Parties List System (EPLS) and General Services Administration's list s for such Ineligible Persons. All UVMC Staff must disclose to UVMC any debarment, exclusion, suspension or other event that makes that person an Ineligible Person within twenty -four (24) hours of becoming aware of such event. UVMC will remove known Ineligibl e Persons from responsibility for, or involvement with, UVMC 's business operations related to Federal 07/22/2013 14 health care programs and will remove them from any position for which their compensation or the items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed by s uch individual are paid by a Federal health care program or with Federal funds at least unti l such time as such individual is reinstated into participation in the Federal heal th care programs. If UVMC has actual notice that a UVMC Staff is charged with a c riminal offense that falls within the scope of 42 USC \u00a7 1320a-7(a), (b)(1)-(3), or if prop osed for exclusion during such individual's employment or contract term UVMC will take all appropriate actions to ensure that the responsibilities of such individual have not an d shall not adversely affect the quality of care rendered to any patient or any claims submi tted to a Federal health care program. Insider Information/Confidential Information In the course of employment with Ukiah Valley Medical Center, U VMC Staff may become aware of non-public information about UVMC that is material to the UVMC 's business strategy and operations. Non-public, material information may i nclude, among other things, plans for mergers, marketing strategy, financial results, or ot her business dealings. UVMC Staff may not discuss this type of information with anyone outs ide the organization. Within the organization, UVMC S taff should discuss this information on a strictly \"need -to-know\" basis and only with other UVMC Staff who require this informati on to perform their jobs. License and Certification Renewals UVMC Staff, individuals retain ed as independent contractors, a nd privileged practitioners in positions which require professional licenses, certification s, or other credentials are responsible for maintaining current credentials and shall compl y at all times with federal and state requirements applicable to their respective disciplin es. UVMC does not allow any UVMC Staff member, independent contract or or privileged practitioner to work without a valid, current license or creden tial. Each UVMC Staff member must have evidence of current and valid license, certifi cation, registration, accreditation or credential as r equired by their position descr iption. Copyright and Intellectual Property UVMC respects the ownership rights of those creating physical, digital, and intellectual property. Copyright infringement is u sing copyrighted property without the owner's permission. This unauthorized use is also called piracy. Exam ples could include using unlicensed software, distributing many copies of non-public boo ks or articles, and using business models (intellectual property) without consent or cred it. UVMC Staff will not utilize copyrighted physical, digital, and intellectual property withou t the prior written permission of the owner. Personal Use of UVMC Resources Credit cards, desks, and other items provided by UVMC continue to remain organizational property, must be maintained in accordance with UVMC 's policies, and used only for business purposes. UVMC reserves the right to monitor and inspe ct all organizational property, without notice, and without the UVMC Staff member pre sent. UVMC may monitor 07/22/2013 15 and inspect organizational property even if a password or perso nal code has been assigned. Prior authorization must be obtained before the remov al of any organizational property from the premises. All organizational property must be returned immediately upon request or termination in the same condition as when originally provided. Personal items brought onto the organization's property also are subject to inspection, without notice, and without the UVMC Staff member present. Relationships among UVMC Staff In the normal day-to-day functions of an organization like UVMC , there are issues that arise from how people in the organization relate to one another . It is impossible to foresee all of these issues, and many do not require explicit treatment in this Code of Conduct. While we wish to avoid any strict rules, no one should ever fee l compelled to give a gift to anyone for a birthday, holiday or other celebration, and any gi fts offered or received should be appropriate to the circumstances. A lavish gift to anyone in a supervisory role would clearly violate organization policy. Similarly, If UVMC agrees to support a charitable organization, no UVMC Staff member should feel compelled to con tribute to the charitable organization, nor should there be any workplace consequences of such non-participation. For reasons of supervision, safety, security and morale, family members will not be employed under the direct supervision of one another nor will t hey be placed in the same department, division or facility if the work involves potential conflicts of interest. For these reasons, as well to avoid misunderstandings, complaints of favo ritism or possible claims of sex discrimination or sexual harassment, managers and superviso rs are prohibited from establishing, maintaining, or att empting to establish or mainta in a romantic or sexual relationship with any subordinate employee within their chain o f command. The term \"family members \" includes a UVMC Staff member's parents, children (natural, adopted or under legal guardianship), spouse, brothers, sisters, grandpare nts, grandchildren, cousins, aunts, uncles, in-laws and step-relationships with all the prec eding relationships. An exception to this policy is allowed only with the approval of t he Vice President of Human Resources. If co-employees become related, or if a supervisor and a subord inate attempt to or establish or maintain a romantic or sexual relationship, it sho uld be reported promptly to the immediate supervisor of the manager or supervisor who is re lated or involved in the relationship. If co-employees become related, we will make reas onable efforts to assign job duties so as to minimize probl ems of supervision, safety, s ecurity or morale. Relationships with Subcontractors and Suppliers UVMC has a Code of Conduct and Business Relationship Statement that outlines its commitment to ethical and compliant behavior and its expectatio ns of the same by its contractors. We treat our vendors fairly and maintain impartial ity in our relationships. We do not allow our friendships with our vendors or others with wh om we may do business in the future to affect our business decisions. Charitable gifts or contributions from vendors are not required , and have no bearing upon their actual or potential business relationship with us. To the extent permitted under applicable laws, subsidies to underwrite the costs of medical e ducation or professional meetings are permitted, in that they benefit patient care and c ommunity health. 07/22/2013 16 UVMC Staff must manage consulting, subcontractor, and supplier relationships in a fair and reasonable manner, free from conflicts of interest and cons istent with all applicable laws. UVMC promotes competitive procurement to the maximum exte nt practicable. UVMC 's selection of consultants, subcontractors, suppliers, and vendor s will be made on the basis of objective criteria including quality, technical ex cellence, price, delivery, adherence to schedules, service, and maintenance of adequate so urces of supply. Our purchasing decisions will be ma de on the supplier's ability to meet our needs, and not on personal relationships and friendships. UVMC employs the highes t ethical standards in business practices in source selection, negotiation, determinat ion of contract awards, and the administration of all purchasing activities. UVMC complies with contractual obligations not to disclose vendor confidential information unless permitte d under the contract or otherwise authorized by the vendor. It is critical to avoid the appearance of impropriety when givi ng gifts to individuals who do business or are seeking to do business with UVMC. UVMC will nev er use gifts or other incentives to improperly influence relationships or business ou tcomes. Our Responsibilities while Developing Busi ness and Marketing Se rvices UVMC operates in a highly competitive environment. UVMC 's business development and marketing activities must conform to the highest standards of i ntegrity and fairness reflected in this Code of Conduct . UVMC requires compliance wit h antitrust and other laws governing competitive activities. Antitrust and Unfair Competition UVMC restricts communication wit h competitors. Generally, UVMC Staff are not to discuss with competitors non- public \"competitively sensitive topics.\" Because the antitrust laws are so complex and their application can depend upon the conditions in local markets, it is not practical to adopt written polices to govern all situations. UV MC Staff should consult with their supervisors or the Compliance Department for guidance con cerning competitive activities, laws and polices relating to their areas of respons ibility. Marketing and Advertising Consistent with laws and regulations that governs such activiti es, UVMC uses marketing and advertising to educate the public, provide information to t he community, increase awareness of services provided by UVMC, and for recruitment pur poses. UVMC strives to present only truthful, fully informative, and non-deceptive inf ormation in these materials and announcements. UVMC will not distort the truth about servic es or products provided by the hospital, nor will we attack or disparage another provid er, whether by name or implication, in any marketing or advertising efforts. We may fe ature our outstanding services or offer factual evidence of quality of care, but will not claim superiority where it cannot be substantiated. 07/22/2013 17 Our Responsibilities in our Relationships with other Companies This part of the Code of Conduct should not be considered in an y way as an encouragement to make, solicit, or receive any type of entrainm ent or gift. Receiving Business Courtesies We do not expect any gifts from our vendors beyond good service . However, UVMC recognizes that there will be times when a current or potential business associate, including a potential referral source, extends an invitation to a U V M C S t a f f m e m b e r t o attend a social event, in order to further develop or provide a ppreciation of a current business relationship. All gifts, entertainment and business m eals provided or received must be reasonable and small enough that they do not influence our decisions. We never offer or accept anything of value in exchange for referrals or other business. We let our vendors, physicians, customers and others know that our core va lues limit what we can receive or give. We want our services and business relationship s to stand on their own. What is a gift? It is anything of value - including traditional marketing items like t-shirts or logoed items - if the recipient receives it for free. We should recognize there is a difference between a simple pen and an expensive electronic device from a vendor. What constitutes entertainment? This includes an invitation to events, sports activities or games or concerts where the recipient is not expected to pay fo r a ticket or participation fee. We should recognize there is a difference between attendin g a community-supported or non-profit gala and front-row seats at an expensive event. What constitutes a business meal? This is any meal where the pr imary purpose of the meeting is to discuss UVMC business or quality initiatives. If you question a gift or participation in an entertainment eve nt, contact the Compliance Department. Extending Business Courtesies to Non-Referral Sources 1. Meals and Entertainment. - There may be times when a UVMC Staff member wishes to extend to a current or potential business associate ( other than someone who may be in a position to make a patient referral) an invitat ion to attend a social event (e.g., reception, meal, sporting event) to further or dev elop a business relationship. The purpose of the entertainment must never be to induce any favorable business action. During these events, topics of a bus iness nature must be discussed and the host must be present. 2. Sponsoring Business Events - UVMC sponsors events for legiti mate business purposes (e.g., hospital board meetings or retreats). These eve nts may include UVMC paid meals, entertainment, transportation and lodging. How ever, all elements of these events, including these courtesy elements, mu st be consistent with the corporate policy on business events. 3. Gifts - It is critical to a void the appearance of impropriet y when giving gifts to individuals who do business or are seeking to do business with UVMC. We will 07/22/2013 18 never use gifts or other incentives to improperly influence rel ationships or business outcomes. In order to avoid embarrassment, an effort should be made to ensure that any gift we extend meets the business conduct standards of the recipient's organization. U.S. federal and state governments have strict ru les and laws regarding gifts, means and other business courtesies for their employees. UVMC does not provide any gifts, entertainment or anything else of v alue to any employee of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government or its fiscal intermediaries, except for minor refreshments in connection with business discu ssion. Our Responsibilities in our Relationships with Government Agenc ies and Officials UVMC and its representatives comply with all federal, state, an d local laws governing participation in government relations and political activities. As a general policy, UVMC funds or resources will not contribute directly to individual p olitical campaigns, political parties or other organizations that intend to use the funds pri marily for political campaign objectives. At times, UVMC may ask UVMC Staff to make personal contact with government officials or to write letters to present our positions on specific issues . In addition, it is part of the role of some UVMC management to interface on a regular basis with go vernment officials. If a UVMC Staff member is making these communications on behalf of t he organization, he/she must be certain to be familiar with any regulatory const raints and observe them. At no time may UVMC Staff speak on behalf of UVMC without first be ing given consent by the CEO or his/her designee. Avenues of communication may include t raditional ways such as telephone and letters along with newer ways such as social medi a. Guidance is always available from the Compliance Department as necessary. How We Ensure Compliance with our Code of Conduct Program Structure The Compliance Program is intended to demonstrate in the cleare st possible terms our absolute commitment to the highest standards of conduct, ethics , and compliance. The elements of the program include setting standards, communicatin g those standards, providing mechanisms for reporting concerns, monitoring and aud iting, program effectiveness, and maintaining an organizational structure that continues to support the Compliance Program. These elements are supported at all levels of UVMC. The Corporate Compliance Committee is responsible for providing direction, gu idance and oversight to senior leadership and the Lo cal Compliance Committee. The UVMC Compliance Officer and the Compliance Department are r esponsible for the day-to-day direction, coordination and any applicable revisions or updates of the Code of Conduct and the Compliance Program. This includes developing re sources (including policies and procedures, training programs, and communication t ools), distributing standards, providing support (including operating the Complianc e hotline, conducting program assessment, and providing advice), ensuring compliance with training requirements and otherwise administering the program. 07/22/2013 19 In support of the UVMC Compliance Officer, UVMC Senior Leaders have expertise in various areas of compliance and are called upon to lead policy and training development efforts, conduct monitoring and auditing as appropriate, and pr ovide advice. Additionally, the Vice President of Human Resources, the hospital Risk Manage r, and the Accreditation Coordinator are all important resources that may be accessed to address issues arising out of this Code of Conduct. UVMC 's Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring the functioning of the Local Compliance Committee. Setting Standards UVMC sets standards through this Code of Conduct, along with ou r associated policies and procedures and the annual or periodic (for applicable positions) compliance progra m training. It is the responsibility of each individual to be aw are of these policies and procedures, how they pertain to his or her work, and to follow these policies and procedures. Training and Communication Comprehensive training and education has been developed to ensu re that UVMC Staff are aware of the standards that apply to them. Code of Conduct trai ning is conducted at the time an individual joins UVMC and annually for all UVMC Staff. Compliance training in areas of compliance risk (e.g., billing, coding, cost reports) is required of certain individuals. UVMC and Adventist Health policies outline the tra ining requirements. For UVMC employees, all training is recorded within our complia nce education system. System administrators and the Compliance Officer can track empl oyee compliance with their training requirements and report such information as nece ssary. Non-employees will receive training as required by a pplicable requirements or regu lations. Personal Obligation to Report UVMC is committed to ethical and legal conduct that is complian t with all relevant laws and regulations, and to correct wrongdoing wherever it may occur at UVMC. Each UVMC Staff has an individual responsibility to report any activity by any staff, physician, subcontractor, or vendor that appears to violate applicable law, rules, regula tions, accreditation standards, standards of medical practice, federal healthcare co nditions of participation, or this Code of Conduct. If any UVMC Staff member or Board member has concerns, we encou rage you to report it through one of our reporting com pliance program options identif ied below so that we may investigate and resolve the issue. However, if you believe we have left an issue unresolved, the matter can be reported to other entities such a s Adventist Health, the Medical Board of California, The Joint Commission, and the Depa rtment of Public Health. There will be no retaliatory disciplinary action taken against any individual who reports concerns to any of these entities. 07/22/2013 20 Resources for Guidance and Reporting Concerns To obtain guidance on an ethics or compliance issue or to repor t a concern, individuals may choose from several options. We encourage the resolution of your concerns, at a local level. You may report issues to your immediate supervisor or any member of the Leadership Team. Your other reporting options include: Our policies and procedures can be accessed through our Intrane t. UVMC makes every effort to maintain, within the limits of the l aw, the confidentiality of the identity of any individuals who report concerns or possible mis conduct. UVMC does not retaliate or discipline anyone for reporting a concern in good faith. Any staff member who deliberately makes a false accusation with the purpose of harmi ng or retaliating against another staff member is subject to discipline. Internal Investigations of Reports We are committed to investigating all reported concerns promptl y and confidentially to the extent possible. The Compliance Officer coordinates any finding s from investigations and immediately recommends corrective actions or changes that need to be made. We expect all staff to cooperate with investigation efforts. Corrective Action Where an internal investigation substantiates a reported violat ion, it is UVMC 's policy to initiate a corrective action, including, as appropriate, making prompt restitution of any overpayment amounts, notifying the appropriate governmental age ncy, instituting whatever disciplinary action is necessary, and implementing systemic cha nges to prevent a similar violation from recurring in the future. Discipline All violators of the Code of Conduct will be subject to discipl inary action in accordance with the UVMC Employee Handbook.

Measuring Program Effectiveness We are committed to assessing the effectiveness of our Complian ce Program through various efforts. Much of this effort is provided by the Adventi st Health Corporate Compliance Department, which routinely conducts audits of issue s that have regulatory or compliance implications. Responsible executives routinely under take monitoring efforts in support of policies and compliance in their areas of responsibi lity. Review: This Code of Conduct is reviewed at least every two years and r evised as necessary in response to issues which arise in the health-care industry, cha nges in accreditation, legal and/or regulatory requirements, and recommendations, which may arise from resolution of ethical issues.

During their first phone call they discussed what she wanted to work on regarding her health and fitness, set goals, and planned how she could achieve those goals. \"My health coach has been very encouraging and has given me great tips both by phone and email. I think that having a health coach is a great benefit provided by Adventist Health. It helps to have someone objective to talk with about my personal goals. It gives me an opportunity to step back and assess what I am doing, so that I can achieve better health.\" Lori has continued to check in with her health coach every few weeks regarding her progress toward her health goals.

SUPPORT, STRENGTH AND SUCCESS: LOSING 226.4 POUNDS WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS \"I started working on my weight in 2013 by joining Weight Watchers, which I am still active in. By February of 2014 I had lost 100 lbs. all from just eating better. At that time I was unable to exercise from the severe back pain I had, and I could barely walk or stand for five minutes at a time. From 2014 to 2015 I had stopped losing weight \u2014 I had plateaued, and whether I gained or lost weight, I was always within a couple pounds of the 100 I had lost. In May of 2015 I needed emergency back surgery and it was a complete success, even if I didn't think so at the time. After the surgery, I became depressed. I turned back to food for comfort and ended up gaining 60 lbs. back of what I had lost. In January of 2016 I started to focus on what was positive in my life and then on my weight. I started going to Weight Watchers meetings again and walking. It was in July of 2016 that I started going to the gym and exercising, and I still am going to the gym faithfully each week. Exercise was what was missing from my life, it is exactly what I needed. I currently weigh 221.2 pounds. Eating better, exercising, going to Weight Watchers and having the love and support of family, friends, co-workers and the community has been amazing and so very helpful.\"Matthew Hartke EMR coordinator, Home Health & Hospice Adventist Health Home Health & Hospice Services Mendocino CountyLivingWell: Adventist Health's whole-person health and wellness program LivingWell is offered to all employees and is required for all Engaged!

Adventist Health's LivingWell program has encouraged this already-fit pair to develop an even healthier lifestyle. You might think marathon runners couldn't possibly have much room to improve, but each of them credits the LivingWell program for important health outcomes. Vicki began running in 1987 with her husband. They were inspired by watching the Portland Marathon and wanted to do it for themselves. Starting with just one-mile runs, they worked their way up to full marathons. Vicki's husband, Gary, completed 72 marathons before he passed away in 2012. His goal was to run 100 marathons, which Vicki and Emillie have decided to complete in his memory. For Emillie, running marathons was something she picked up after her parents had started. She was overweight and decided she wanted to take control of her life. Vicki trained with her daughter and walked and ran with her during her first marathon. Training for marathons takes a lot of time, discipline and dedication. For Vicki and Emillie it's something they share. Through their weekly long runs they spend time talking and even in prayer. With the ultimate goal in sight, Vicki and Emillie have completed a marathon every two weeks since March 2017. Vicki completed her 100th marathon on July 15. INSPIRED BY LIVINGWELL \"Being part of an organization that emphasizes wellness means so much to me,\" says Vicki. \"The LivingWell program has helped me improve my health by changing how I eat. Because of classes and challenges that have been offered at work I've moved to a diet with more whole, plant-based foods. I used to be on medication for my blood pressure, but by eating differently I no longer need it.\" Emillie's experience is similar. \"It's a lot of small things,\" she says. \"From signs encouraging us to take the stairs, and information about walking routes on campus, there's a culture of being active. The LivingWell challenges give us the opportunity to explore new and different aspects of our health. A fruit and veggie challenge helped me jump start improvements in the way I was eating. That's helped me lower my cholesterol by 22 points.\" Vicki Classen, telephone operator at Adventist Health Portland, and her daughter, Emillie Niblack, customer care associate, are grateful for their health and fitness achievements. 11\"In January I was in a really bad place when it came to taking care of myself. In April 2017 I decided to go to the TakeTEN program in St. Helena. Three months later I am completely transformed, inside and out. I have lost 21 pounds and have re-prioritized both my physical and mental health. Looking back at pictures I can see now what I couldn't see then. It hasn't always been easy, but I know that I'm worth it. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I'm well on my way, and I know I won't ever go back. TakeTEN was a life-changing experience for me, and I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to go. Take care of yourself. Prioritize yourself. Believe in yourself. Love yourself.\" \u2014Jennifer Cowan, Engaged! Premier Program member 12Why do I have to complete LivingWell points if I am already healthy? LivingWell is a lifestyle. It's remaining aware of and being responsible for your health on a continual basis, beyond open enrollment or your annual physical exam.

A group of employees at Millsbridge Family Care, Adventist Health Lodi Memorial, decided it was time for a Biggest Loser Challenge. The eight-week challenge encouraged them to get into shape, eat healthier, and win a prize. Throughout the eight weeks, they motivated each other by holding everyone accountable to sticking to their weight loss strategies. Losing weight is not an easy task; however, a supportive environment greatly aids in achieving one's health goals. \"My strategies that drove success were working out just about every day, paying attention to what I was eating, and practicing portion control.\" After eight weeks she was able to drop 11.6 pounds. \"I learned that portion control was the key to success. I have always been very active with sports and exercise but lacked a true control over my eating habits. I'm now eating breakfast every day which works to shape the rest of my meals for the day.\" As a group, the Biggest Loser Challenge participants lost nearly 60 pounds.

AH facilities : no deductible. AH providers : $200/enrollee. Non-AH PPO providers : $400/enrollee. Copayments don't count toward deductible .

Each enrollee must meet their own individual deductible and a separate deductible applies to each enrollee. Are there services covered before you meet your deductible ? Yes. Preventive care , primary care services, and certain other services are covered before you meet your deductible . This plan covers some items and services even if you haven't yet met the deductible amount. But a copayment or coinsurance may apply. For example, this plan covers certain preventive services without cost-sharing and before you meet your deductible.

What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit? Your required premiums *, balance- billing charges, and health care this plan doesn't cover.

You have the opportunity to redirect a portion of your wages on a pretax basis for benefits available through the Plan. Health care and dependent care expense reimbursements are administered through separate flexible spending accounts. WHAT IS THE WELFARE PLAN CONTRIBUTION BENEFIT? Your pretax dollars make contribution payments for coverage under your employer's group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plan. You make an election when you are hired and you complete the welfare plan enrollment forms. If you choose not to enroll when you are hired, you may add the benefit on a post - tax basis. The contributions will automatically roll over to pretax withholdings at the beginning of the next Plan Year. Your employer must receive written notification before a new Plan Year if you decide to change your withholdi ng election. When insignificant cost increases occur your employer will automatically change contribution deductions. Welfare plan benefits are payable based on the terms of these plans or policies. Benefit selections are subject to Cafeteria Plan qualifyi ng election change event rules that are similar to those in the table at Appendix A. Please discuss changes with Human Resources to ensure you comply with the IRS Regulations. WHAT IS THE HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT BENEFIT? Eligible health care expenses incurred but not reimbursed under any other health plan can be reimbursed from this account based on your redirection election. WHAT IS THE DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT BENEFIT? Eligible dependent care expenses incurred in order to enable you and your spouse to be employed can be reimbursed from this account based on your redirection election. SALARY REDIRECTION AGREEMENT You may elect to sign an agreement by which you authorize the Company to redirect a portion of your salary and contribute t he amount of that redirection on your behalf (as a before -tax contribution) to the benefit(s) of your choice. 2 WHAT IS THE CURRENT MAXIMUM AMOUNT A PARTICIPANT CAN CONTRIBUTE? The maximum spendable dollars for the Plan Year are $17,000. Welfare Plan contributions are limited to actual charges for coverages elected. The maximum annual Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account election is $2,600. The maximum annual Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account election is $5,000 for single employees and married employees who file joint returns. Married employees filing separate returns are limited to $2,500. MAY ELECTIONS BE CHANGED DURING A PLAN YEAR? The legal requirements of a Cafeteria Plan do not permit salary redirection election changes during a Plan Year unless a qualifying election change event occurs. In that case, you may make a new election due to and consistent with your qualifying event. The table in Appendix A details qualifying election change event scenarios allowed by the IRS. WHO IS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE PLAN? Adventist Health is the Administrator of the Plan. Adventist Health has the right to interpret the Plan and to modify elections by employees in accordance with any legal requirements relating to the Plan. If I Need More Information, W hom Should I Contact? If you need more information about the Cafeteria Plan, please call the Flexible Spending Administrator, Benefits Administration at 800- 441-2524. Participating Employers The entities that have elected to participate in the Plan are: Adventist Health Corporate , Portland Adventist Medical Center, Hanford Community Hospital , Reedley Community Hospital , Adventist Health Physicians Network, Castle Medical Center, Feather River Hospital, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Willits Hospital, Lodi Memorial Hospital Association, Inc. , St. Helena Hospital Napa Valley , Adventist Health Clear lake Hospital, Inc. , San Joaquin Community Hospital, Simi Valley Hospital and Health Care Services , Sonora Community Hospital , Adventist Health Medical Center Tehachapi, Northwest Medical Foundation of Tillamook , Ukiah Adventist Hospital , Western Health Resources, and White Memorial Medical Center 3 CAFETERIA PLAN BOOKLET GENERAL INFORMATION AN OVERVIEW Adventist Health (the \"Company\") offers you the opportunity t o choose between cash and the following benefits: Welfare Plan Contribution Benefit Health Care Expense Reimbursement Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Under the welfare plan contribution benefit, the dollar amounts that you elect to redirect from yo ur salary on a pretax basis under this Plan will be used to make contribution payments for coverage periods occurring within the Plan Year under the (i) group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plans. . Your pretax salary reduction amounts will be paid directly to the plan(s) or insurer(s). Benefits will be payable according to the terms of the respective plans or policies. In addition, the two reimbursement account options allow you to pay eligible health care and dependent care expenses with before- tax earnings. All three options reduc e your income taxes below what you would pay if you bought the same coverages on an after -tax basis . When you participate, you agree to redirect part of your paycheck for your welfare plan or reimbursement account contributions before Social Security and federal and state income taxes have been withheld. You pay less in taxes because your taxable income is reduced by the amount of your redirection. After you incur eligible expenses, you request reimbursement from th e appropriate account in tax -free dollars. Note: No actual accounts are established, the Flexible Spending Accounts are merely bookkeeping accounts established to keep track of your contributions. Benefits are paid as needed from the Company's general as sets. Redirection of your wages reduces your salary for Social Security purposes. You may receive a lower Social Security benefit at retirement, death or during disability. This employee booklet and the attached table in Appendix A (collectively the \"booklet\") describe the basic features of the Adventist Health System/West Cafeteria Plan (the \"Plan\" or \"Cafeteria Plan\" ), how it operates and how you can get the maximum advantage from it. The Company has established the Plan pursuant to a P lan Document in to which this booklet has been incorporated. However, if there is a conflict between the official P lan Document and the booklet, the P lan Document will govern. Coverage under the group health (medical/dental/vision) benefit plans is discussed in a summar y or an official certificate of coverage you receive from the Administrator of the Plan or insurance carrier. If there is a discrepancy between this booklet and the summary or certificate of coverage you receive from the Administrator of the Plan or insur ance carrier, the summary or certificate of coverage will govern. 4 ELIGIBILITY You are eligible to participate in the Plan if you are a regular full -time, part -time, or per diem employee as those classifications are defined in the applicable Participating Employer's personnel policy and procedure manual. DATE OF PARTICIPATION If you are an eligible employee, you will become a Participant in the Plan on the first day of the pay period following your completion of the necessary enrollment forms. Welfare plans may have different effective dates. Please refer to those Plan Documents. If you become an eligible employee after the Plan Year has begun, you must enroll in the Plan within the first 31 days of becoming an eligible employee. If you do not enroll when you are first eligible, you must wait to enroll in the Plan until the next annual enrollment period unless you experience a qualifying election change event. Welfare plans may allow enrollment throughout the Plan Year. The contributions will not be wit hheld on a pretax basis if the enrollment does not occur within the first 31 days of becoming an eligible employee. The enrollment period will be held annually, at dates set by the Administrator of the Plan, before the beginning of the Plan Year for which elections are being made. If you enroll during the enrollment period, you must wait until the next annual enrollment period to change your elections, except in certain cases where you have a qualifying election change event. The table in Appendix A deta ils qualifying election change event scenarios allowed by the IRS. ENROLLING IN THE PLAN During the annual enrollment period (or during the first 31 days after you become an eligible employee), you need to indicate whether you want to participate in any of the following: Welfare Plan C ontribution Benefit Health Care Expense Reimbursement Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement You may, of course, decline participation if you wish. As an eligible employee, you will have an opportunity to enroll once each year. If you fail to make an election during the annual enrollment period, your elections will remain the same for the following Plan Year for the welfare plan contribution benefit. To continue participating in the reimbursement accounts, you must re -enroll eac h year during the annual enrollment period. CHANGING OR STOPPING YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS Your contribution (your election) amount will stay in place for the coverage period, unless you have a qualifying election change event. The change to your Salary Redirect ion Agreement must be requested during the 31- day period immediately after the qualifying change and must be due to and consistent with such change. (Please refer to the CHANGE IN BENEFIT ELECTIONS FORM .) The Administrator of the Plan will review and eit her approve or deny the request for the change in election. If approved, the change will be effective the first pay period AFTER the approval is granted, except in the case of birth, adoption or placement for adoption in which case the change will be effe ctive the date of the event when the enrollment form is received within 30 days of the event. 5 If you take a general leave of absence other than a leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), you may elect to continue participation in the Plan and pay your share of contributions with after-tax dollars while on leave Alternatively, you may prepay the contributions for the expected duration of the leave on a pretax salary reduction basis out of your pre -leave salary. If you elect to prepay your share of the contributions before your leave, you must make a special election to that effect before the first pay period for which the deductions will be made. Dependent care accounts must be terminated or suspended prior to taking a Leave of Absence as expenses for daycare/childcare are not eligible for reimbursement while out on leave. If you elect to terminate coverage during an unpaid Leave of Absence, you must submit a Change in Benefit Elections form (1) before your leave and (2) another form within 31 days after returning to work in order to reinstate participation. Reinstatement will be at the same rates of coverage in effect before the Leave of Absence unless there has been another qualifying election change event. TRANSFERS BETWEEN PARTICIPATING EMPLOYE RS If you transfer from one Participating Employer to another, the health care and dependent care expense reimbursement benefits you elected will transfer with you. You will have to re- enroll for the welfare -plan contribution salary reduction; however, this will not be considered a change in election. Your health plan and AD&D coverage must remain the same as that originally elected with the first employer unless a qualifying election change event occurs as a result of the transfer. In that case, an election change may be made consistent with such qualifying election change event. PLAN YEAR January 1 through December 31. COVERAGE PERIOD Period during Plan Year you are an Eligible Employee and have elected to participate in the Plan. DEBIT CARD The flexi ble spending account offers the Take Care debit card. The Take Care debit card through Adventist Health is a great way to pay for your eligible medical, dental, vision and pharmacy expenses. You can elect a debit card on MyFlexOnline.com under the Card Center tab . The card is good for up to 3 years if an election has been made for each plan year. Certain expenses do not require additional documentation while some do. Please see a few examples below to help better address when you need to send in documents f or verification. Services that do not require verification: -Doctor office co- pays -Prescriptions -ER co -pays Services that do require verification include but are not limited to: -Dental procedures -Glasses & Contacts -Major surgeries -Medical Equipment In the event that an expense is not eligible/overpayment has been made and the card has been used, we will adjust the claim to the correct dollar amount, and suspend the debit card until the balance is repaid. 6 WHEN PARTICIPATION ENDS Your participation ends as of the date one or more of the following occurs: Employment with the Company ends You are no longer eligible to participate (see ELIGIBILITY on page 4 ) When Participant fails to make contributions during an unpaid leave of absence or after termin ation of employment. (Special rules apply to a FMLA.) Date Participant revokes Election to Participate due to and consistent with a qualify election change event For the health and dependent care reimbursement account options, the January 1 following an enrollment period in which you do not elect to contribute to the account(s); however, if you have a balance in your account on the last day of the Plan Year, you may continue to participate through the grace period as applicable. The Plan is terminated IF YOU LEAVE THE COMPANY Upon termination you may stop making contributions and discontinue participation in the Cafeteria Plan. Only eligible expenses incurred before termination may be submitted during the year and until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year. If you return to service during the same Plan Year and elect to participate in the Plan, your former elections will be reinstated after prorating for the period you were not employed by a Participating Employer. If you return to service within 30 days of termination, you are required to resume participation at the same election in effect when you terminated. An alternative for the terminating participant is to continue making after -tax contributions for the Health Care Expense Reimbursement account, incurring eligible expenses for the remainder of the year, and submitting claims (until July 1) for services incurred during the Plan Year. You may continue to submit claims (until July 1) for eligible expenses incurred during the remainder of the year for the balance of your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account without making additional contributions. IF YOU DIE A beneficiary may file claims for eligible expenses incurred while you participated in the Cafeteria Plan (before your death). Your beneficiary must submit such claims by July 1 following the end of the Plan Year in which you were participating. FEDERAL RULES THAT APPLY TO REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTS Reimbursement accounts take advantage of federal laws that allow you to pay eligible health care and dependent care expenses with pretax dollars --that is, with money that has not been taxed. Since reimbursement accounts provide tax advantages, the IRS imposes certain restrictions on their use. The IRS requires that you use the money in your reim bursement accounts for expenses you incur during the Plan Year (or during the grace period if applicable) in which you are participating. The Plan Year ends on December 31; however, you have until July 1 of the 7 following year to request reimbursement for expenses incurred during the year. If you do not claim all of the money in your account by that date, the balance is forfeited. If you enroll in both reimbursement accounts, you may not transfer balances from one account to the other. Your Health Care E xpense Reimbursement Account balance remains totally separate from your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance. Once you enroll, you may not stop your payroll deductions or change the amount you contribute during the year unless you have a qu alifying election change event. You have 31 days from the date of the qualifying election change event to change your election. All election changes that you make are prospectively effective from the date the election change is made except in the case of birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, for which election changes made within 30 days are effective the date of the event. This means that if you add a new dependent or spouse for reasons other than birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, only ex penses incurred after the date of the qualifying election change event are reimbursable under the Plan for the new dependent or spouse. For example, if you get married on June 1 and make an election to increase your Health Care Spending Account contributi on on June 15, only expenses incurred by your new spouse (and any other newly acquired dependents as a result of the marriage) on or after June 15 are reimbursable under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any expenses incurred by your spouse (or other newly acquired dependents) before June 15 will not be reimbursed under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT The Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account allows you to set aside pretax dollars, t hrough payroll deductions, to pay for qualifying health care expenses not reimbursed by any other health plan. As you or your spouse and qualifying dependents incur eligible health care expenses, you request reimbursement from your Health Care Expense Rei mbursement Account in tax -free dollars. For purposes of the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, qualifying dependents are defined by IRC \u00a7105(b) . Generally, this includes your legal spouse (as defined under federal law), your child(ren) and any qualifying relatives . Your child(ren) includes your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child or legally adopted child, regardless of such child's tax dependent status, marital status, employment status, student status or residency . Your child(ren) is eligible for coverage under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account until the end of the year in which he or she attains age 26. Other qualifying relatives may also be eligible. (See QUALIFYING RELATIVE section for a list of individuals who may be qualifying dependents.) CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR HEALTH CARE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT When you enroll in a Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, you choose how much you want deducted annually from your pay and redirected pretax into the account in your name. Y ou may elect to contribute up to $2, 600 per year to your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. The amount you choose is divided by the number of pay periods in the year and deducted on an equal pretax basis from each of your paychecks throughout the year. If your paycheck is less than the amount elected, you must pay any balance due by the first of the next month. Because of IRS rules, it is important to estimate your annual health care expenses carefully when determining the amount you wish to redi rect into your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Amounts not used for eligible expenses incurred during the coverage period, usually the Plan Year, are forfeited. (See the exception to this rule for QUALIFIED RESERVIST DISTRIBUTIONS, below .) 8 ELIG IBLE EXPENSES Most health care expenses not reimbursed by your or your spouse's medical, dental or vision plans can be reimbursed through your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account, provided the service/item is received during the coverage period in which you are participating. (Payment date does NOT determine if or when the Plan may reimburse you for the expense.) You can be reimbursed for medical expenses incurred for you, your spouse or others claimed as dependents on your federal income tax return . IRS Code \u00a7213(d)(1) defines medical care as diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body. An expense which is merely beneficial to the general health of an indivi dual is NOT considered an expense for medical care. Eligible medical expenses include, but are not limited to: Deductibles Co-payments under medical, dental and vision plans Orthodontia-- Refer to flier detailing orthodontia reimbursement (available on Con nect) Mental health services in excess of health plan benefits Charges in excess of established usual and customary amounts, as determined under Company medical and dental plans Otherwise unreimbursed dental services (not cosmetic) Medical equipment Chirop ractic services, if to treat a specific medical condition Physical therapy Prescription drugs (qualifying drug or biological that legally requires physician's prescription Over-the-counter drugs and medicines if prescribed by a physician Smoking cessation programs and prescription drugs Insulin Podiatrist fees Support or corrective devices that are necessary for daily living Acupuncture fees Eye exams, eyeglasses, and contact lenses (not covered by a vision care program) Hearing exams and aids Meals, lodgin g and mileage while away from home for medical treatment (see below on how to file) Fees related to a weight -loss program. Cost of diet foods is not covered. (A copy of the physician prescription must accompany the ledger.) IMPORTANT: Effective January 1, 2011, federal law no longer allows expenses for over -the- counter drugs and medicines to be reimbursed from the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account unless prescribed by a physician. Eligible expenses must be incurred on or after your effective date of participation and must be substantiated by the provider of services. Generally, this means you must provide a third -party 9 receipt that shows: 1. The medical treatment, item or device received; 2. The date the expense was incurred; and 3. The amount of the expense. MEALS, LODGING, AND MILEAGE Expenses for transportation and related travel are reimbursable when you obtain medical care for yourself, your spouse, or a qualifying dependent at a location greater than 100 miles from your employing locati on. The travel expenses must be primarily for and essential to medical care. No significant element of personal pleasure, recreation or vacation may be contained in the travel expenses. (See QUAILIFYING RELATIVE section for a list of individuals who may be qualifying dependents.) You must submit substantiating documentation along with your reimbursement request in order for transportation and related travel to be considered an eligible medical expense. Such documentation must include: A letter from the referring physician indicating the name and location of the referred licensed healthcare facility and the name of the attending physician at that location. Original receipts for lodging, meals, public transportation (plane, train, etc .), and local transpo rtation (rental car, public transit, etc.) and fuel. If you use a vehicle other than a rental car, you must provide a contemporaneous mileage log showing the dates of travel, the travel origination and destination points, and the starting and ending odo meter readings of the vehicle you use. IRS limits the amount of travel costs for medical expense purposes to the following: Meals - only those eaten while en route to and from the medical treatment site Lodging - $50 per person per day Mileage - Rate as published by the Internal Revenue Service Persons covered - patient and one attendant if required for medical reasons Your reimbursement cannot exceed the amount of your annual salary redirection election for the Healthcare Expense Reimbursement Acc ount. EXPENSES NOT ELIGIBLE Examples of health care expenses that are not reimbursable by your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account include but are not limited to: Over -the-counter drugs and medicines that are not prescribed by a physician Health plan contributions Any expense reimbursed by a health, dental or vision plan Cosmetic surgery, unless medically necessary Marriage or family counseling Funeral or burial expenses 10 Household or domestic help, even if advised by your doctor Custodial care Massage therapy for general health Any expense incurred in connection with an illegal operation or treatment Health club fees Cosmetics, toiletries, toothpaste, slippers and other personal care items (e.g. shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, etc.) Medical expenses you itemize or for which you take a tax credit on your federal income tax return HOW YOU ARE REIMBURSED To request reimbursement for an eligible expense, submit electronically via MyFlexOnline, MyFlexM obile application, or a completed Expense Claim Form to Benefits Administration, PO Box 619031, Roseville, CA 95661- 9031. You must furnish documents such as itemized bills/invoices or computer printouts, or health plan Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for all expenses claimed. Payment of covered claims will be made to you by direct deposit or check up to the contribution amount you elected. You will only be reimbursed for eligible health expenses for which you have actually received service. No claims will be paid before the services are provided. Claims will b e processed every Tuesday and Thursday on a weekly basis. Claims must be in the Friday prior. If your claim is denied, you may file an appeal (see APPEAL OF DENIED CLAIMS section below). YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE You will receive periodic statements of your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance during the year. Review these statements carefully to help ensure that you use all of your contributions by year -end. REIMBURSEMENT DEADLINE You have until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year to subm it your reimbursement requests for the current Plan Year. Eligible health expenses include only those amounts for services/items received during the coverage period usually the Plan Year and the grace period discussed below, in which you participate in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any balance remaining after July 1 is forfeited. A \"grace period\" follows the end of the Plan Year for the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account for amounts you have allocated to your account that are unus ed at the end of the Plan Year. These amounts may be used to reimburse eligible health expenses incurred during the grace period. The grace period will begin on the first day of the subsequent Plan Year, January 1, and end on March 15. In order to take advantage of the grace period, you must be participating in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the last day of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates. For example, if the Plan Year ends December 31, 2018 , the grace period begins January 1, 2019 and ends March 15, 2019 . The following additional rules apply to the grace period: Eligible health expenses incurred during the grace period and approved for reimbursement will be paid first from amounts that were remaining at the end of the Plan Year to which the grace 11 period relates and then from any amounts that are available to reimburse expenses incurred during the current Plan Year. Remember, you may not use Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account amounts to reimburse health expenses. QUALIFIED RESERVIST DISTRIBUTION You may be able to receive a taxable distribution of amounts allocated to the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account that are unused in the event you are called to active duty if you meet the following criteria: You are a member of a \"reserve component\" (as defined in section 101 of title 37 of the United States Code), which means a member of the Army National Guard; the Reserve for the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force or Coast Guard; Air National Guard of the United States; or the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service; You are called or ordered to active military duty for (i) 180 days or more or (ii) for an indefinite period; You provide a copy of your order or call to active duty; and You are a p articip ant in the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the date you are called or ordered to duty. If you believe you are eligible for a Qualified Reservist Distribution, you must contact the Administrator of the Plan to request a distribution request fo rm as soon as possible. A request for a Qualified Reservist Distribution must be made in writing on the form provided by the Administrator of the Plan. You must submit a copy of your order or call to active duty along with your request. Requests for a Qualified Reservist Distribution must be made on or after the date of the order or call to duty but before the last day of the Plan Year (or grace period, if applicable) during which the order or call to duty occurred. You will receive your Qualified Reserv ist Distribution within a reasonable period of time, but no later than sixty (60) days after your request has been received. A Qualified Reservist Distribution will be made based on all salary reduction amounts credited to your Health Care Expense Reimbur sement Account for the applicable Plan Year that have not been applied to provide reimbursements submitted before the Qualified Reservist Distribution request is submitted. Claims incurred and submitted but not yet reimbursed at the time the Qualified Reservist Distribution Request is received will be treated like any other claim submitted for reimbursement under the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account . The Administrator of the Plan will determine what this amount is on a uniform basis, consistent w ith applicabl e law and IRS interpretations. Unlike your reimbursements from your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account for eligible health expenses , the amount of your Qualified Reservist Distribution is taxed as income and will be reported as income on your W -2. Qualified Reservist Distributions do not apply to amounts in your Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account . 12 DEPENDENT CARE EXPEN SE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT The Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account allows you to set aside pretax dollars , through payroll deductions, to pay for qualifying dependent care expenses. These expenses can include care for your children, disabled spouse or other qualifying dependent as defined in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \u00a7152. (See \"Qualifying Individual\" bel ow.) As you incur eligible dependent care expenses, you request reimbursement in tax -free dollars. NOTE: Dependent care expenses are eligible for reimbursement through your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account if they are necessary to enable you to be gainfully employed (you and your spouse if you are married). If your spouse is not employed, dependent care expenses will not be eligible, unless your spouse is a full -time student or is physically or mentally incapable of self -care. Additionally , if you are divorced or legally separated, you must be the custodial parent and need childcare in order for you to work. The IRS states that you must make the determination as to whether you are gainfully employed or in active search of gainful employment on a daily basis. Payments you make under a caregiver arrangement that requires you to pay for care during short, temporary absences will be qualified employment -related expenses. The IRS has established a period of two consecutive weeks or less as a safe harbor for short, temporary absences. The Administrator of the Plan may determine that longer periods of absence are short, temporary absences based on your facts and circumstances. In no situation will absences of 12 weeks under FMLA be deemed shor t, temporary absences. Part -time employees who are required to pay for care on a periodic basis, such as weekly or monthly, will be able to claim those payments as qualified employment -related expenses. CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSE REIMBURS EMENT ACCOUNT When you enroll in a Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account, you choose how much you want deducted annually from your pay and redirected into the account in your name. You may elect to contribute up to $5,000 per year. (If you are mar ried and filing separately, you may contribute up to $2,500 per year. See \"Limitations on Your Contributions\" below.) The amount you choose will be divided by the number of pay periods in the year and deducted on an equal pretax basis from each of your paychecks throughout the year. If your paycheck is less than the amount elected, you must pay any balance due by the first of the next month. Because of IRS rules, it is important to estimate your annual dependent care expenses carefully when determining the amount you choose to redirect into your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Amounts not used for qualifying dependent care during your coverage period are forfeited. LIMITATIONS ON YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS Your contributions to the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account cannot exceed the lesser of your annual earned income or that of your spouse. If your spouse is a full -time student or incapable of self -care, your spouse's monthly income will be considered to be $250 per month if you have one dependent or $500 per month for two or more dependents. 13 QUALIFYING INDIVIDUAL Must share the same principal place of abode with you for more than half the taxable year . An individual age 12 or under who is your \"qualifying child\" as defined in IRC \u00a7152(c).

WHO may PROVIDE services: A relative may provide dependent care services as long as he or she is not a dependent for whom you claim a deduction. Services may not be provided by: Your spouse or dependent Your spouse's dependent Your child under the age of 19 at the close of the calendar year The parent of your qualifying child; e.g. the noncustodial parent 14 WHERE services may be performed: In your home Outside your home - For the care of your dependent age 12 or under - For a Qualifying Individual who regularly spends at least eight ( 8) hours a day in your home ELIGIBLE EXPENSES include, but are not limited to, char ges from: A licensed child care center A nursery school In-home care for a child/spouse unable to care for him/her self Daytime summer camp (not educational) An adult day care center An adult private sitter, nanny or home care companion EXPENSES NOT ELIGIB LE Examples of dependent care expenses that are not reimbursable by your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account, as defined by the IRS, include, but are not limited to: Nursing home charges Kindergarten fees Schooling fees for children in the first grade and up Tuition Food, clothing, or transportation expenses Overnight camp Payments to a dependent you claim as an exemption for federal income tax purposes Expenses you deduct or for which you take a tax credit on your federal income tax return Presc hool fees when separate from childcare HOW YOU ARE REIMBURSED To request reimbursement from your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account for an eligible expense, submit electronically via MyFlexOnline, MyFlexMobile application, or submit a completed E xpense Claim Form to Benefits Administration, PO Box 619031, Roseville, CA 95661- 9031. The following information must be on file and/or provided with your claim: 1. Dependents for who services were performed 2. Amount of requested reimbursement 3. Relation ship, if any, of the service provider to you - If services were performed by one of your children, the age of such child 15 4. Place and date where services were performed - If outside your home, does the dependent receiving such services spend at least eig ht (8) hours per day in your home - If at a Dependent Care Center [as defined in IRC \u00a721(b)(2)] , does the center provide dependent care for more than six (6) individuals on a nonresident basis 5. If you are married, provide a statement as to: - The amount of your spouse's earned income if less than $5,000 per calendar year - If your spouse is not employed, is - Spouse incapable of self -care - Spouse a full -time student attending classes at least five ( 5) months per calendar year Payment of covered claims will be made directly to you by direct deposit or check, up to the annual contribution amount you elected, but not to exceed the amount you have contributed to date. You will only be reimbursed for eligible dependent care expenses that have actually been incurred during your coverage period. No claims will be paid before the services are provided . The date you pay for your dependent care services DOES NOT determine when or if the Plan may reimburse you. If your claim is denied, you may file an appeal (A PPEAL OF DENIED CLAIMS section below). YOUR ACCOUNT BALANCE You will receive periodic statements of your Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account balance during the year. Review these statements carefully to help ensure that you use all of your contri butions by year -end. REIMBURSEMENT DEADLINE You have until July 1 following the end of the Plan Year to submit your reimbursement requests for the Plan Year. Eligible dependent care expenses include only those amounts for services received during the coverage period, usually the Plan Year and the grace period discussed below, in which you actively participate in the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account. Any balance remaining after July 1 is forfeited. A \"grace period\" follows the end of the Plan Year for the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account for amounts you have allocated to your account that are unused at the end of the Plan Year. These amounts may be used to reimburse eligible dependent care expenses incurred during the grace period. The grace period will begin on the first day of the subsequent Plan Year, January 1, and end on March 15. In order to take advantage of the grace period, you must be participating in the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account on the last day of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates. For example, if the Plan Year ends December 31, 2018, the gra ce period begins January 1, 2019 and ends March 15, 2019 . The following additional rules apply to the grace period: Eligible dependent care expenses incurred during the grace period and approved for reimbursement will be paid first from amounts that were remaining at the end of the Plan Year to which the grace period relates and then from any amounts that are available to reimburse 16 expenses incurred during the current Plan Year. Remember, you may not use Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account amounts to reimburse dependent care expenses. AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO SAVE TAXES Using the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account is just one way you can receive a tax break for eligible dependent care expenses. The federal government also allows a tax credit called the household and dependent care credit for eligible dependent care expenses when you file your income tax return. The household and dependent care tax credit is an allowance for a percentage of your annual day care expenses as a credit against your federal income tax liability under the U.S. Tax Code. In determining what the tax credit would be, you may take into account only $2 ,400 of such expenses for one eligible dependent or $4 ,800 for two or more dependents. Depending on your adjusted gross income, the percentage could be as much as 35% of your eligible day care expenses to a maximum credit amount of $1,050 for one dependent or $2,100 for two or more dependents (to a minimum of 20% of eligible day care expenses). The maximum 35% must be reduced by 1% (but not below 20%) for each $2,000 portion (or any fraction of $2,000) of your adjusted gross income over $15,000. Tax credit limits may ch ange in future years. Visit the web site for the Internal Revenue Service at www.irs.gov for updates. You can use both the Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account and the federal tax credit, provided you do not claim the same expenses for both. You s hould consult a personal financial or tax advisor to help you decide whether the tax credit or the Dependent Care Spending Account is more favorable for you. Note: The amounts that may be used to calculate the tax credit are reduced dollar for dollar by amounts reimbursed under the Dependent Care Spending Account. See IRS Publication 503 for a complete discussion of the tax credit. 17 APPEAL OF DENIED CLA IMS The following appeal procedures apply only to the Health Care Expense Reimbursement Account and Dependent Care Expense Reimbursement Account .

Assignments will be del egated by the Charge RN, based upon pati ent acuity and competency/expertise of available staff. An RN will be ass igned to oversee and complete ne cessary patien t care and documentation for patients assigned to an LVN and CNA. Telemetry techs/ward clerk are a ssigned based on patient census and at the discretion of the Charge Nurse and House Supervisor. PATIENT ACUITIES Patients on the Medical Surgical Unit are classified from an A, B, or C acuity by meeting one or more of the level descriptions as follows. All patients on the Medical Surg ical Unit require routine vital sign monitoring, assessment, planning and order r eview every shift unless orders indicate differently.

There is a current nursing pla n of care devel oped by an RN an d maintained by the nursing staff for each patient which add resses the patient's needs D.CRITICAL FACTORS FOR STAFFING: The staffing for each unit is ba sed on several critical factor s: 1. Patient characteristics and number of patients2. Acuity level of patients based on Patient Classification Syst em for each unit 3. Variability of patie nt care across the un it (including pendin g admits, discharges, etc.) 4. Scope of services provided by each unit5. Nursing staff competency and experience.6. Minimal staff ratios effective Jan, 2004 E.NURSING INPUT: The Professional Nurse Practice Council provides an avenue for soliciting and receiving input from nurses on t he development, on-going monito ring, and evaluatio n of the revised staffing plan. At least two thirds of the members of the PNPC a re RNs who are staf f nurses and spend the majority of their time doing patient care. T here can be one LVN representation on the Council. (See NPC Charter/membership). F.MINIMAL NURSE-TO-PATIENT STAFFING RATIOS FOR EACH PATIENT CARE UNIT: The staffing ratios mandated by California law establish the minimal staffin g levels for each unit and type of patient at UVMC. Every attempt possible t o adjust staffing to meet the required ratios according to the variation of patient census and care needs w ill be made by utilizing the guidelines that follow in this staffing plan. There will always be a minimum of 50% RNs on any given unit. G.Hospital Minimum Nurse-to-Pati ent Ratios as Required by AB 394 1. A nurse at UVMC is def ined as an RN or LVN. Hospital Unit Rat io Nurse: Patient Emergency Departments (Basic & Comprehensive level)1:4 Labor) 1:4 Postpartum 1:6 (mothers only) Couplets (moms & babies) 1:4 Combined Labor & Delivery 1:3 Mixed Units 1:5 Neonatal Level II Nursery 1:8 ASSIGNMENT: The Charge Nurse with guidance from the Departm ent Director or Nursing Supervisor will assign n ursing according to: 1. The minimal staffing ratios/ Title 22 regulations2. The patient classification system (patient acuity tool) of ea ch unit includ ing licensure requirement 3. Competency/qualifications/ and experience level of the nurse4. California State Scope of Pra ctices for licensed nurses (RN a nd LVN) 5. Unit skill mix required accordin g to patient nee d (not to exc eed 50% LVNs) 6. Considerations to ensure patient safety I.PLAN FOR DOCUMENTATI ON OF ASSIGNMENT: 1. A 24-hour standardized recording form (see Patient Assignment Documentation Form) will be maintained b y each unit. Included will be the date, shift, pati ent assignment by individual patient, nurse responsible, title/license category, and respons ible licensed nurse providing break and meal relief correlated to patient assig nment. These r ecords should be kept current. The nursing supervisor will be a ccountable for review of comple teness and follow-up as appropriate. The records will be housed in the Directors Office for a minimum of one year starting Jan 1, 2004. 2. Documentation on the patient assignment documentation form mu st be professional and appropriate. There should be no comments in the Medical Record regarding staffing issues. If the nurse wants to document a sta ffing issue, it should be done following the staffing variance reporting process. J.MEAL/BREAK RELIEF: 1. Meal and rest break times will be scheduled by the Charge Nur se for licensed nurses at the beginning of each shift. Breaks (i.e. the 3 rest breaks due in a 12 hour shift) cannot be \"stacked\" or consolidated. For 12-hour shifts, there will be th ree (3) ten-minute breaks and one (1) thirty-minute meal break in accordance with applicable meal period waivers. For 8-hour shifts, there will be two (2) ten-mi nute rest brea ks and (1) th irty-minute meal break. See table below for other shifts . Rest breaks and meals must be taken acc ording to the California Labor Law. (Department of Industrial Wel fare Commission, Wage & Order Law, #5, 2001). Schedule for Breaks & Meals ** = Employee may waive one of th e two meal periods for 10 or 1 2 hour shifts Rest breaks Meal period Hrs 0.1 - 4 Hrs 4.1 - 8 Hrs 8. 1 - 12 By hour 5 Before hour 7 0-4 hour shifts No No no no No4-6 hour shifts Yes No no no No6.5 hour shifts Yes No no yes No8 hour shifts Yes Yes no yes No10 hour shifts Yes Yes no yes** yes**12 hour shifts Yes Yes yes yes** yes**Page 3 of 9 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/c gi/doc-gw.pl?ref=uvmc:1046 72. At the beginning of each shi ft, a nurse not having any other patient assignment during the break or meal relief time will be assigned to provide relief fo r a nurse who has a patient assignment. It is th e responsibility of the bedside care nurse to take the break/meal when break or meal is scheduled and/or offered. 3. It is the responsib ility of the Charge Nu rse and Supervisor t o proactively sc hedule break and meal relief according to the law described on page 3 of this po licy and in accordance with the Meal and Rest Period Policy. In em ergencies, when the break can not be taken as scheduled, the Charge Nurse and Su pervisor should be c ontacted for other m eal/break arrangements. Documentations of patient assignment and the name and title of the relief nurse responsible shall be maintained by the uni t Charge Nurse, as outlined in th e Documentation Requirements portion of this Staffing Plan. 4. To ensure safe patient care, t he nurse providi ng meal and res t break relief w ill be advised by the nurse assigned to the patien t of the patient status, using the Transfer of Care process for immediate patient needs, and co de status, if special considerat ions (example: DNR) exist. frequently with admissions, discharg es, and transfers. The Charge Nurse, Dir ector, and Nursi ng Supervisor w ill determine wh en ratios are not being met real time and begin a call-in or call-back process per guid elines. Similarly wh en census drops, a call-off process will be initiat ed. Refer to Sur ge Protocol. L.CALL-BACKS: If nurses have not been put on \" Hospital Requested Time Off\" s tatus, and they are placed on paid \"on-call\" status, they will be re quired to be av ailable and respond with in the unit specific time frame unless special arrangements are agreed upon. Call ba ck will be initiated by the supervisor or designee. (See Hospital Requested Time Off Policy). M.CALL-INS: Call-ins will be bas ed first on skill mix as determined by the Patient Classification System and 50% (LVN to RN) rule consideration. 1. The Staffing Office, or designated person on behalf of the Ho use Supervisor, will determine if there are cross-train ed nurses already working in the hospital who could have their workload evaluated and reassigned without impacting other unit's ratios. 2. If not, off duty nursing staff that are not scheduled for the next shift will be c ontacted. All staffing adjustments and calls will be logged in the staffing office by the following information: nursing unit, time of call, name of nursi ng staff contact ed, title (RN, LVN, CNA), and response. Priority of calls will be started with the part-time staff; proceeding a s necessary to full-time staff (consideration to OT issues that can result in burn-out and jeo pardy of patient safety will be evaluated for each circumstance). 3. If no one can come i n, calls will be made to determi ne if any of the next shift's nurses can come in early, or switch shifts. 4. Staff with like competencies th at are able to cover the patie nt population requiring coverage are contacted. 5. If the additional ca lls still result in no additional staff, and attempts to contac t all off duty nurses have been made, the Depa rtment Director will be called to help problem solve or come in to assist with staff, if available. 6. If the Department Director is already working or is unavailab le, a call to the A dministrative On- call person will be made to determine the ne xt course of action , including review of the Surgery and Procedures schedules. Electiv e and/or ambulatory case cance llation will be considered and determination mad e based on impact to o verall and specific unit staffing. N.PLAN FOR BED CONROL/HOSPITAL THROUGHPUT: During high census pe riods or when staffed bed availability is low, admission requests are e valuated and p atient placement (bed allocation) granted based on priority assessment. Page 4 of 9 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/c gi/doc-gw.pl?ref=uvmc:1046 71. Admission Priorities: Patients are to be placed on the patien t care unit best suited to provide the level of nursing care requir ed. Admission is based on a fir st-come, first served basis, except in bona fide emergency situations. Admission priorities, chain of notification, and/or diversion procedures are implemented based on staffed bed availability an d threshold definitions. 2. Threshold Definitions: The maximum number of available licens ed patient care beds for each unit is: Med Surg 35**44 licensed beds 9 beds temporarily out of service but have 24 hour turnaround time requirement Intensive Care 6Perinatal 13 Level II Intensive Care Newborn Nursery2****Program Flexibility with DHS allows up to 10 if lower acuity babies. 3. In addition there are: OR Suites 7 PACU Beds 12 ER 14 treatment spaces Pre-Op Room 6 Ambulatory Recovery Room (post op- Main OR)5 O.BED/STAFFING SHORTAGE: When individual unit threshold are reached, or there is unavai lable staffing for additional admission s, transfers in from outside s ources are discouraged. The House Supervisors will contac t the Administrative on-call designee fo r involvement of decision-making. Considerations include: 1. Involvement of Case Managers regarding potential discharges. 2. Status of Emergency Department and O.R. consideration of imme diate potential admissions 3. Notification of attending phys icians and determination of pot ential discharges or transfers 4. Applicability of imple menting diversion plan 5. Discussion between Administrat ion (or designee) and physician s/surgeons regarding potential delay/rescheduling of electiv e admissions and procedures P.HOLDING PATIENTS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPT: 1. When there are admitted pat ients in the Emergency Dept. a. Huddle conviened including HS , Charge nurses from ED, OB, ICU , MS and PeriOp and hospitalist on duty may include case managers and clinical directors. Purpose of the huddle is to; Page 5 of 9 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/c gi/doc-gw.pl?ref=uvmc:1046 71. Determine safest and most effec tive plan to care for all 'adm itted patients' in the hospital. Q.PATIENT PLACEMENT: A Bed Request form is generated by ER nurse or for direct admi ts and by the House Supervisor . The House S upervisor will noti fy the patient care unit Charge Nurse of potential admissions and collaborate to ma ke the best bed assignment base d on patient needs and available staffing/space. R.APPROPRIATE PATIENT PLACEMENT (Bed Allocation): 1. Perinatal natal Admission Guidelines 2. Medical/Surgical- See Med/Surg Admission Guidelines 3. Intensive Care Unit- See ICU Admission Guidelines S.EMERGENCY STAFFING: (Refer to Surge Protocol) 1. A health care emergency is d efined in Title 22 as \"An unpredi ctable or unavoidable occurrence at unscheduled or unpredictable i ntervals relating to health ca re delivery requ iring immediate medical intervention and care.\" All atte mpts will be made to de al with any rapid influx of patients. The guidelines described in the \"Call-In\" section of this plan will be implemented promptly, utilizing a ll nursing departments ' staff as applicabl e. If the staffing issues are not resolved, the House Supervisor should quickly proceed up the ch ain of command as outlined in Chain of Command policy. 2. In all circumstances, there shou ld be a prompt r esponse to th e situation. Triaging of admits will be accomplished in consultation with the House Supervisor, Admi nistrative on-call designee and the ER (or other appropriate) physician. Transfers and move ment of in-pat ients will be determined with the Attending Ph ysician and Administrative on-c all designee. Cancellation of surgeries and pr ocedures will be evaluat ed. Closure of patient unit(s) and diversion to other facilities will be eva luated based on impa ct to the community a nd patient safety. If necessary, a disaster state will be declared per the Emergency Preparedness Plan. 3. Hospitals are not required to seek prior approval from DHS, L & C to decrease staffing levels below required ratios during a h ealth care emergency. Hospitals are expected to respond immediately to emergency situati ons in the most effective manne r to ensure the health and safety of their patients. T.NON-COMPLIANT STAFFING: 1. It is the intent of UVMC to a lways strive to be in complianc e to the nurse staffing ratios. If at any time the licensed nurse feel s the staffing ratios are out o f compliance, he/she should contact the Supervisor as soon as possible so prompt action can begin. If concerns are not resolved, the Chain o f Command Policy should be followed. Docum entation of concern should occur through the staffing va riance reporting process. 2. In the unexpected event that s taffing ratios do not meet stan dards, and \"Call-in\" procedure described above still have not resolved the non-compliance, eva luation of safe patient care shall be done by Charge Nurse of that unit in conjunction with the House Supervisor. Safe patient care is determined if the patient needs can be met with out jeopardizing their well-being, clinical treatment course, and needed monitoring and the licens ed nurse is working within their scope of practice. Pat ients may be temporarily held in other nu rsing care units such as the ER, PACU, etc. until staffing ratios c an be achieved after patients are admitted. If unsafe conditions are present, the Nursing Management/Administration must be cont acted immediately for resolution. Resolution may be acc omplished by Nursing Directors working where they are oriented and competent to a speci fic population, and circumstan ce assessment determined on a case by case basis. 3. If no resolution to the non-co mpliant ratios can be found and all above plans have been implemented, evaluated and docum ented, a determination must be made by members of the Page 6 of 9 5/2/2018 https://www.lucidoc.com/c gi/doc-gw.pl?ref=uvmc:1046 7Medical Staff and Administration (VPPC or designe e) what action s would be in th e best interest of the patient. If no unsafe con dition exists, the patient may remain at the hospital and continued on-going steps to com e into compliance attempted. If unsafe conditions are determined to exist, and no resol ution is possible, rapid attem pts for patient transfer/diversion to an equal or higher level of ca re must occur, keeping in mind EMTALA requirements. Unit or beds closure may have to occur u ntil staffing resolution can be accomplished. U.COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITY: UVMC is committed to meeting t he acute, health care needs of o ur community. The bed closure/trans fer issues must be weighed with the obligation to mitigate risk of patient safety, and for services this hospital must provide for the region. 1.PLAN FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION: A formal continuous program for recruitment and retention of licensed nurses o ccurs at UVMC through the eff orts of Human Resources Dept in conjunction with the Nursing Service Departments. The activi ties include: 2. Professional nurse involvement in decision-making within the domain of professional practice 3.

Adm in. Code, \u00a7 999.5(d)(5)(F) Employee Guarantees In Section (1)(B) of this Application , the Applicant has attached a copy of the MFA with SJHS . Section 4.7 of the MFA provides, in pertinent part: \"Nothing in this Agreement shall alter or affect the JOC Participants' status as separate and distinct employers, nor shall it alter or affect relationships with employees or bargaining units within their operations and labor relations within their organizations .\" Title 11, Cal. Admin. Code, \u00a7 999.5(d)(5)(G) Reproductive Health Services The proposed transaction will have no impact on reproductive health care services provided by any health care facility affiliated with the Applicant , and no impact on the availability or accessibility of repro ductive health care services. As described in Section (1)(A) of this Application, the proposed transaction involves the creation of a joint operating company (the JOC, ST Network, LLC ), whose Governing Board will be appointed on an equal basis by the Applicant and S JHS. The proposed transaction affects only governance control relating to the hospitals at issue in the transaction: the proposed transaction does not effect a change in the scope or type of any reproductive health care services currently provided by any hospital or health care facility. In this regard, it is critical to note that both the Applicant and SJHS will continue to operate under their own religious mission and values and neither is imposing its ecclesiastical precepts or policies on the other. In this regard, the Applicant's health facilities will continue to be Adventist institutions and will continue to adhere to the values of the Seventh- day Adventist Church. Similarly, the SJHS facilities will continue to be Catholic institutions and will continue to be subject to the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Healthcare Services (\"Directives\"). The AH facilities will not be subject to the Directives or Catholic teaching, nor to the SJHS's Statement of Common Values, and the AH facilities shall exclusively retain the (a) ownership of assets related to; (b) governance responsibility for; (c) operational management of; and (d) revenues and expenses generated by, the provision of services that are contrary to the Directives. These provisi ons are intended to ensure that both parties participating in the JOC continue to operate in a manner consistent with their own ecclesiastical standards. As a result, this S ection is inapplicable. Title 11, Cal. Admin. Code, \u00a7 999.5(d)(5)(H) State ment Describing Material Effects of Proposed Transaction on Delivery of Health Care Services to the Community The proposed transaction is expected to have a substantially positive effect on the delivery of health care services to the communities served by the Applicant and SJHS and their related health care facilities, and should materially improve the availability and accessibility of health care in the affected communities. The Applicant and SJHS have proposed to create the ST Network in order to fu rther their shared goal of providing improved access to quality healthcare throughout the region, with a particular emphasis on vulnerable and underserved populations. Both organizations seek to create a partnership that recognizes and builds upon their f aith based traditions and common values of dignity, excellence, and service. Through this transaction, the parties believe that they will be able to better adapt to the changing healthcare environment; establish an integrated delivery system that provides for continuum of care and population health management; improve infrastructure and utilize the technological tools available to expand the reach and scope of their services; and assure the affected communities that there will not be a reduction in the availability or accessibility of health care services. The Applicant and SJHS also believe they will be able to provide care closer to home for more patients by concentrating on centers of excellence, creating a broader and deeper value - based provider netw ork, integrating clinically across systems, and collaborating on health information sharing and care management. The parties, therefore, expect to reduce the substantial outmigration that occurs today as patients will be able to access care locally that presently they travel substantial distances to obtain. The parties also expect that the ST Network will stabilize volumes, strengthen quality, and reduce costs in the Northern California region. Title 11, Cal. Admin.

Admin. Code, \u00a7 999.5(d)(5)(K) Description of Measures Proposed by Applicant to Mitigate or Eliminate Adverse Effects on Health Care Services Provided to the Community that May Result from Proposed Transaction There will be no adverse effects on the availability or accessibility of health care in the community as a result of the proposed transaction between Applicant and SJHS . As described in Section (1)(A) of this Application, the proposed transaction involves the creation of a joint operati ng company (the JOC, ST Network, LLC ), whose Governing Board will be appointed on an equal basis by the Applicant and SJHS . The proposed transaction affects only governance control relating to the hospitals at issue in the transaction: Adventist Health Clearlake Hospital, Inc., dba Adventist Health Clear Lake; Willits Hospital, Inc., dba Adventist Health Howard Memorial; St. Helena Hospital dba Adventist Health St. Helena; St. Helena Hospital dba Adventist Health Vallejo; and Ukiah Adventist Hospital dba A dventist Health Ukiah Valley. The proposed transaction does not effect a change in the scope or type of any medical services currently provided in the JOC's service area. Moreover, as set forth in Sections (1)(C) and (5)(H) of this Application, t he proposed transaction is expected to have a substantially positive effect on the delivery of health care services to the communities served by the Applicant 's affiliated health facilities. Title 11, California Admin. Code , \u00a7 999.5(d)( 6) POSSIBLE EFFECT ON C OMPETITION Title 11, Cal. Admin. Code, \u00a7 999.5(d)(6)(A) Analysis on the Possible Effect of the Proposed Transaction on Competition The Applicant expects the proposed transaction will have a positive effect in the relevant product or geographic markets, including through increased competition. In particular, there are significant opportunities to provide care closer to home for more patients by concentrating on centers of excellence, creating a broader and deeper value -based provider network, integratin g clinically across systems, and collaborating on health information sharing and care management. By realizing these opportunities, the ST Network should be able to reduce the substantial outmigration that occurs today as patients will be able to access c are locally that presently they travel substantial distances to obtain. The ST Network will also allow the Applicant and SJHS to stabilize volumes, strengthen quality, and reduce costs, particularly in Napa County. Importantly, given the concern that com petition be maintained or enhanced in Northern California, the ST Network will increase the ability of the providers involved to compete for managed care patients. The Applicant and SJHS believe the ST Network will be a more attractive partner for payers that wish to compete more forcefully with Kaiser, which today (despite not having a hospital in Napa County) accounts for more than four in ten commercial lives in Napa County. And just as importantly, the ST Network will provide opportunities to expand t he provision of managed Medi -Cal services to those who rely on Medi -Cal for their health care. Title 11, Cal. Admin. Code, \u00a7 999.5(d)(6)(B) Premerger Notification and Report Form Pursuant to the Hart -Scott -Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 This Section is not applicable, as the Applicant is not required to submit a Premerger Notification and Report Form pursuant to the Hart -Scott -Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 in connection with this proposed transaction. Title 11, California Admin . Code \u00a7 999.5(d)( 7) OTHER PUBLIC INTEREST FACTORS Title 11, Cal. Admin. Code, \u00a7 999.5(d)(7) Other Public Interest Factors As discussed in Section (5)(H) of this Application, the proposed transaction is expected to have a substantially positive effect on the delivery of health care services to the communities served by the Applicant and its related health care facilities, and should materially improve the availability and accessibility of health care in these communities.

To transform the health of our communities at a cost that is affordable, assures access and ultimately provides the highest value with particular attention to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. To nurture a relationship that capitalizes on the strengths of each organization to build on our legacy of quality, wellness and prevention. To maintain separate hospital ministries that are uniquely Adventist and uniquely Catholic, while integrating other elements of the network to ensure the most effective and efficient delivery of population health services. The new joint operating company will be neither Adventist nor Catholic, but rather a combined expression of God's love in everything it does. 5/2/2018Why St. Joseph Health? St. Joseph Health is the ideal partner: their mission is highly aligned and their geographic presence complements ours. More access points will make us stronger and help us extend our mission in this region. Clinical integration will strengthen our ability to deliver quality care to the communities we serve and improve the health experience for our patients. 5/2/20181 2 3 45 6 7 9The Strength of Our Partnership *Bed count based on most recent Audited Financial Statements All discharge data based on 2015 California OSHPD reports. 1,066 Beds Beds203,571 Patient Days9 Hospitals425 Affiliated Physicians 41,477 Discharges Adventist Health Howard Memorial Adventist Health Ukiah Valley Adventist Health Clear LakeAdventist Health St. Helena Adventist Health VallejoAdventist Health 5 6 7 8 9St. Joseph Health 1 2 3 4St. Joseph Hospital -Eureka Redwood Memorial Hospital Santa Rosa Memorial HospitalQueen of the Valley Medical Center2,937 Adventist Health Employees3,658 St. Joseph Health Employees 8 5/2/2018907,491 Service Area PopulationShared Mission and Values Mission Statement Core ValuesIntegrity Compassion Respect ExcellenceLiving God's love by inspiring health, wholeness and hopeTo extend the healing ministry of Jesus in the tradition of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange by continually improving the health and quality of life of people in the communities we serve. Dignity Service Excellence Justice 5/2/2018What changes will occur? Over time, as we integrate and combine service delivery, we will see sharing and shift in services between facilities in the network. We will begin to see changes in the way we communicate to our patients and the public. We are making some public announcements, so you'll see news and there may be questions among our staff and our patients. 5/2/2018So, what happens next? We will help you with these discussions. We have an FAQ document that will help you with department/staff discussions. These changes will be good for all of us What should we be telling staff? Patients want to know what this means to them. What it means, quite simply, is that our patients will have access to a wider network. They will still receive the high quality care they've come to appreciate and expect at this hospital. As the integration progresses, we may see incremental changes that will always be improvements. What should we be telling patients? 5/2/2018TALKING POINTSA Partnership with St. Joseph Health Adventist Health and St. Joseph Health have decided they are better able to meet the needs of people in their communities working together than apart. Consequently, we are embarking on a new affiliation referred to as a joint operating company. The new organization will function as a joint operating company made up of five Adventist Health hospitals and Home Health Services, four St. Joseph hospitals, Home Health and Hospice Care, which will work together to provide health care in Humboldt, Mendocino, Sonoma, Lake, Napa and Solano counties. Together, united in purpose, we will embark on a new journey collaborating together to improve the health outcomes of those we serve. The joint operating company will provide greater value to and transform the health of our communities on a number of fronts, including sharing of best clinical practices, enhanced population health services, greater efficiencies, and better value to our patients through increased access to health care and robust wellness and prevention programs. By working together, we can extend our mission and serve more people, while providing patients with more access to services. This type of arrangement allows both organizations to retain ownership of their assets. This new model brings together the best of both organizations, maintains our heritage and aligns with our core purpose and mission. Our calling is similar, our missions are aligned and our cultures are compatible. Like Adventist Health, St. Joseph Health shares similar values. They have a long history of advocating for the vulnerable and disadvantaged at a time when nearly one-third of all Californians rely on Medi-Cal to afford them access to healthcare. Although we come from different faith traditions, we have a shared respect and a commitment to the healing ministry of Jesus by providing physical, mental and spiritual healing. By working together, we can achieve clinical integration, reveal new best practices, allow for cross pollination of ideas, achieve efficiencies and drive innovation. Most importantly this new partnership will enhance both organizations' abilities to fulfill their missions, better serve patients and inspire health, wholeness and hope across the Humboldt, Mendocino, Sonoma, Lake, Napa, and Solano counties.Why St. Joseph Health? Why is this collaboration/affiliation important? Patients - Patients will have more access to more services closer to home. Payors - By working together, we'll be able to provide more services and specialty care in the geographic areas we serve, resulting in improved health outcomes and higher quality. Physicians - We will be better positioned to attract higher caliber physicians. The best physicians are attracted to growing organizations with expanding clinical capabilities.Organizations 4/12/20184/12/2018How will it work? We'll have a leadership team dedicated to the new joint operating company. Kevin Klockenga will assume the leadership role as President & CEO. Kevin currently oversees St. Joseph Health's Northern California Region. In addition, a CFO and a few other key leadership roles will be appointed. This team will be based out of Santa Rosa. Each facility will have a President, similar to our leadership model today. Each facility will retain its branding as the primary identifier, although it will also include the name of the new joint operating company. Employees of each organization will remain employees of the same organization. For example, Adventist Health employees will still work for Adventist Health. Likewise, employees of St. Joseph Health will remain employees of St. Joseph Health. Business strategy, growth and service offerings will be the decision of the joint operating company leadership. The new joint operating company will be governed by a board made up of 10 members (5 appointed by Adventist Health and 5 appointed by St. Joseph Health). The chair of the board will be Bill Wing, President of Adventist Health. Each organization will retain its information systems. We will immediately initiate next steps toward creating an interface for ease of data exchange and patient care purposes.The proposed arrangement will undergo regulatory review. We anticipate this process taking several months. We will be sure to keep everyone informed on our progress.When will this new affiliation take effect?

A This new partnership will be a joint operating company. This type of agreement allows us to integrate parts of the delivery network that will help us grow, improve healthcare outcomes and expand access to quality and affordable care.

A St. Joseph Health is the ideal partner in our region because their mission is aligned with ours and their geographic locations and services complement ours. Our work together will allow us to serve more patients, increase access points and provide a more clinically-integrated network, which will enhance our ability to deliver quality care to the communities we serve and will improve the health outcomes for our patients.Partnership with St. Joseph Health Q How will this benefit the communities we serve? A The benefits of working together are many, including: It will allow both organizations to extend their missions, better serve patients and inspire health, wholeness and hope across Northern California. It will help us to create a more coordinated, integrated health care network allowing for expansion of our geographic reach and services we provide. It allows us to align our resources by providing the right care in the right place provided by the right people with the right skills and talent. Hospitals and clinics will share best practices, allow for the cross-pollination of ideas and work together to drive innovation. This will create growth opportunities for our organizations, improve quality and bring improvements in the availability of services to the communities we serve. Q Will we change our mission? A No. Each of our facilities will remain faithful to our culture, mission and our legacy in the communities that we serve.

A Each ministry will retain its current branding as the primary identifier. Some identifier will be added below the brand to identify its affiliation with the new organization. Q Will my pay or my benefits change as a result of this new relationship? A No. Nothing about your employment relationship will change as a result of this new collaboration. Naturally, we encourage you to continue to provide exceptional care for your patients, just as you always have. Q Will all facilities that are part of the joint operating company go to a common Electronic Medical Record system? A At this time each organization will retain its information system. Once the organizational agreement is finalized one of our first steps will be to immediately create an interface for data exchange. Q Can employees and providers of Adventist Health and St. Joseph Health reach out to each other to discuss aspects of the transition or future plans? A No. Until the regulatory review process is completed, our employees and providers should not contact each other aside from what has been normal communication in the past for patients' medical needs such as patient transfers. Q What action should patients take for continuation of their health care? A No action is needed on their part. The goal is to keep the transition as seamless as possible for patients. Doctors and caregivers will continue to offer services as needed, although the availability of services will expand allowing for additional access points for patients. 4/12/2018Q Do we anticipate adding new jobs or laying off employees as a result of this collaboration? A The creation of this joint operating company is intended to help us grow sustainably. This may require changes that will help us better serve our patients and our communities. We don't know what those changes are today, but as time progresses we will always be transparent with you at the time they are known. Q Who will be the leader of the new joint operating company? A Kevin Klockenga, current President & CEO of St. Joseph Health Northern California Region, will take on the leadership role as President & CEO of the joint operating company. A CFO and other key leadership roles will be appointed and will be based out of Santa Rosa. . Q Does this plan require regulatory approval? A Yes. This agreement requires regulatory review and approval. Once approved, we can begin our work together as part of the joint operating company. Q Will Adventist Health physicians have the opportunity to work at St. Joseph Health? A Certainly, although the needs and demands for healthcare in these communities will not change as a result of this new collaboration. Our shared goal is to encourage physicians to work together to meet the needs of the community. Q What entities will be part of the joint operating company? A There are nine hospitals and their entities that will become part of the joint operating company, including: Adventist Health Howard Memorial Adventist Health Ukiah Valley Adventist Health Clear Lake Adventist Health St. Helena Adventist Health Vallejo St. Joseph Hospital Eureka Redwood Memorial Hospital Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital Queen of the Valley Medical CenterQ How will the joint operating company be governed? A The joint operating company will have its own governing board. Bill Wing, President of Adventist Health, will be the chair of the board. The governing board will be made up of ten members (5 appointed from Adventist Health and 5 appointed from St. Joseph Health).Q Are there other successful Joint Operating Agreements within Adventist Health or St. Joseph Health that are currently in existence? A Yes. This approach is not without precedent. Three Adventist Health System hospitals in the Denver, Colorado area entered into a joint operating agreement with Catholic Health Initiatives, which jointly created Centura Health. The partnership of the two healthcare organizations created Colorado's largest provider of acute care hospital services and enhanced the quality and cost-effectiveness of care while furthering their mission and outreach. A second and more recent example of a joint operating agreement involved Adventist Health System and Alexian Brothers Hospital in the greater Chicago area, which formed Amita Health. In both examples, the joint operating agreements have proven successful in allowing both systems to pursue common goals while being respectful of each other's religious philosophies and faith traditions. 4/12/2018FAQs (continued) Partnership with St. Joseph HealthA Partnership with St. Joseph Health 4/12/2018I am excited to share with you that we have come to an agreement with St. Joseph Health to partner together.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for t he preparation and fair presenta tion of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal cont rol relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free of material missta tement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with aud iting standards generally acce pted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidenc e about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the aud itor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statemen ts, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design aud it procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overa ll presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficie nt and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above pres ent fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Adventist Health System/West at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of their operations and changes in net ass ets, and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting pri nciples. ey April 20, 2018 See notes to consolidated financial statements. -2- December 31 2017 2016 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents 728,269$ 579,659 $ Marketable securities 137,423 293,802 Assets whose use is limited 46,871 34,800 Patient accounts receivable, net of allowance fo r uncollectible accounts of approximately $126,208 an d $117,000 at December 31, 2017 and expenses and other current assets 34,734 34,834 Assets held for sale 15,846 15,769 Total 1,931,507 1,836,378 7,229 21,114 Marketable 623,925 Assets use is limited 309,040 311,570 Long-term investments 113,821 91,920 Other long-term assets 59,595 56,611 Total other assets 1,271,691 1,105,140 Property and equipment, 1,853,850 1,807,776 Total assets 5,057,048$ 4,749,294$ Adventist Health Consolida ted Balance Sheets (In thousands o f dollars) See notes to consolidated financial statements. -3- December 31 2017 2016 Liabilities and net assets Current liabilities: Accounts payable 254,056$ 244,832 $ Accrued compensation and related Other 44,741 Current long-term debt 37,570 34,073 Total current liabilities 665,758 619,901 Long-term debt, net current maturities 1,749,655 liabilities 7,397 Total net assets 2,327,456 2,127,498 Total liabilities and net assets 5,057,048$ 4,749,294$ Adventist Health Consolidated Balance Sheets (continued) (In thousands o f dollars)See notes to consolidated financial statements. -4-Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Unrestricted revenues and support: Net patient service revenue 3,809,674$ 3,642,451$ Less provision for bad debts 85,269 92,271 Net patient service revenue less provision for bad debts 3,724,405 3,550,18 0 P remium revenue 199,423 161,231 Other revenue 178,670 164,473 Net assets released from restrictions for operations 12,024 13,311 Total unrestricted revenues and support 4,114,522 and amortization income 25,516 17,732 early extinguishment of debt -

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Reporting Entity and Principles of Consolidation: Adventist Hea lth System/West (\"Adventist Health\" or the \"System\") is a California not-for-profit religious corporation that controls and operates hospitals and other health care facilities in the Western United States. Many of th e hospitals now controlled and operated by Adventist Health were formerly operated by various conferences of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (the \"Church\"). The obligations and liabilities of Adventist Health and its hospitals and other health care facilities are neither obligations nor liabilities of the Church or any of its other affiliated organizations. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of t he following entities: Adventist Health (System Office) - Roseville, California Adventist Health Bakersfield - Bakersfield, California Adventist Health Castle - Kailua, Hawaii Adventist Health Clear Lake - Clearlake, California Adventist Health Feather River - Paradise, California Adventist Health Glendale - Glendale, California Adventist Health Hanford - Hanford, California Adventist Health Howard Memorial - Willits, California Adventist Health Lodi Memorial - Lodi, California Adventist Health Physicians Network - Roseville, California Adventist Health Reedley - Reedley, California Adventist Health Simi Valley - Simi Valley, California Adventist Health Sonora - Sonora, California Adventist Health St. Helena - St. Helena, California Adventist Health Tehachapi Valley - Tehachapi, California Adventist Health Ukiah Va lley - Ukiah, California Adventist Health White Memoria l - Los Angeles, California Adventist Medical Center-Po rtland - Portland, Oregon South Coast Medical Center - Roseville, California (discontinue d operations) Tillamook Regional Medical Center - Tillamook, Oregon Walla Walla General Hospital - Roseville, California (discontin ued operations) Western Health Resources - Roseville, California Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -8- Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) The entities included in the conso lidated financial statements are organized as not-for-profit corporations under the laws of the state in which they operate and most are tax-ex empt organizations under \u00a7501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of Adventist Health and/or Adventist Health management constitutes the member ship and/or serves as the lega l board of the individual hospital corporations. All material inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Basis of Accounting: The financial statements are prepared in c onformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist pr imarily of unrestricted readily marketable securities with original maturities not in excess of three mont hs when purchased and net deposits in demand accounts. Cash deposits are feder ally insured in limited amount s. Inventories: Inventories, which consist principally of medical and other supplies, are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Marketable Securities: Marketable securities, stated at fair va lue, consist primarily of United States (US) government treasury and agency securities and corporate notes, which are readily marketable and are designated as other-than-trading. Investment income or loss (including int erest, dividends, and realized gains and losses on investments) is included in the excess of revenues over expe nses from continuing operations unless the income or loss is restricted by donor or law. Unrealized gains and losses, calculated using the specific identification method, are excluded from the excess of revenues over expenses from continued operations. Securities with remaining maturity dates of one year or less as of the balance sheet date are classified as current. Assets Whose Use Is Limited: Certain System investments are lim ited as to use through Board resolution, provisions of contractual arrangements with third parties, term s of indentures, self-insurance trust arrangements, or donors who restrict the use of specific assets. The Board an d certain hospital boards have resolved to fund the replacement and expansion of depreciable capital assets but may, at their discretion, use these funds for other purposes. Assets that are expected to be expended within one year are classified as current, including board-designated assets that are available and periodically bor rowed for working capital needs. Split-interest Agreements: The System is the trustee and benefi ciary of various split-interest agreements. The carrying amounts of the System' s split-interest assets are incl uded with investments held by trustee and donor- restricted investments and include marketable securities and re al estate. Trust assets are carried at fair value. Assets under split-interest agreements were $24,876 and $22,907 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Trust obligations are reported in other noncurrent liabilities at their discounted estimated present value using actuarially-determined life expectancy tables. Discount rates r ange between approximately 6% to 12%. Liabilities under split-interest agreements were $2,567 and $2, 301 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Goodwill: The System records goodwill as the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value of net assets acquired. These amounts are evaluated for impairment annually or when there is an indicator of impairment. If it is determined that goodwill is impaired, the carrying value is reduced. The System recorded goodwill of $21,505 and $21,617 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is included in other long- term assets with additions of $68 8 and $535 in 2017 and 2016, r espectively. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -9- Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (contin ued) Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are reported on the basis of cost, except for donated items, which are recorded as an increas e in unrestricted net assets ba sed on fair market value at the date of the donation. During the period of construction, the System capitalizes expen ditures and interest costs, net of earnings on invested bond proceeds that materially increase values, change capacities and extend useful lives. The System accrued obligations for property and equipment of $5,097 and $1 ,597 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Management periodically evaluates the carrying amounts of long- lived assets for possible impairment. The System estimates that it will recover the carrying value of long-lived assets from future operations; however, considering the regulatory envi ronment, competition, and other factors affecting the industry, there is at least a reasonable possibility this estimate might change in the near term. The effect of any ch ange could be material. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 40 years. Amortization of equipment under capit al leases is included in depreciation expense. Debt Issuance Costs: Debt issuance costs are reported as a redu ction of long-term debt and deferred and amortized over the life of the financings using the effective-i nterest method. Bond Discounts/Premiums: Bonds payable are included in long-term debt, net of unamortized original issue discounts or premiums. Such discounts or premiums are amortized using the effective interest method based on outstanding principal over the life of the bonds. Other Noncurrent Liabilities: Other noncurrent liabilities are comprised primarily of accruals for workers' compensation claims, professional and general liability claims, deferred revenue, and lo ng-term charitable gift annuity obligations. Net Assets: All resources not restricted by donors are included in unrestricted net assets. Resources temporarily restricted by donors for specific operating purposes, or for a period of time greater than one year, are reported as temporarily restricted net assets. When the restrictions have been met, the temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets under unrestricted revenues and support. Resources restricted by donors for additions to property and equipment are initially reported as temporarily restricted net assets and are transferred to unrestricted net assets when expended. Resources restricted by donors for nonexp endable endowments are reported as permanently restricted net assets. Investment income from restricted net assets is classified as unrestricted, temporarily restricted, or permanently restricted based on the intent of the donor. Gifts of future interests are reported as temporarily restricted net assets. Gifts, grants, a nd bequests not restricted by donors are reported as other revenue. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -10- Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (contin ued) Net Patient Service Revenue: Net patient service revenue is rec ognized when services are provided and reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-pa rty payors, and others, including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with thi rd-party payors. Retro active adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related service s are rendered. Charity Care: The System provides care without charge or at amo unts less than its established rates to patients who meet certain criteria under its charity care policy. In ass essing a patient's ability to pay, the System uses federal poverty income levels and evaluates the relationship be tween the charges and the patient's income. The System did not materially change its charity care policy during 2017. The estimated cost of charity care was $28,764 and $31,993 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. T he costs were determined using cost-to-charge ratios. Premium Revenue: The System has agreements with various Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) to provide medical services to subscribing participants. Under the se agreements, the System receives monthly capitation payments based on the number of each HMO's covered p articipants, regardless of the services actually performed by the System. Other Revenue: Other revenue is comprised primarily of rental i ncome, retail pharmacy, investment income, electronic health record revenue , and other miscellaneous incom e. Functional Expenses: Approximately 86% of total expenses report ed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to the provision of health care ser vices in 2017 and 2016. The remaining expenses represent general and administrative support. Advertising: The System expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense, included in purchased services and other expenses, was $17,476 and $13,452 in 2017 an d 2016, respectively. Income Tax: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act provides for a new excise tax on certain compensation of exempt organiza tions over $1,000 and requires the separate calculation of unrelated business taxable income for each trade or business carried on. As of December 31, 2017, the System has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enacting the Tax Act; therefore, the System continues to account for those items based on existing a ccounting under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immedi ately prior to enactment. The System will conti nue to make and refine its calculations as additional an alysis is completed. In addition, the System estimates may also be affected as the Syst em gains a more thorou gh understanding of the tax law, as well as receiving guidance from the Internal Revenu e Service (IRS) on how these provisions apply to tax-exempt organizations and taxable affiliates. Income from Operations: The System's consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets include an intermediate measure of operations, labeled \"Income from operations.\" Items that are considered nonoperating are excluded from income from operations and inclu de investment income and losses, gains and losses on acquisitions and divestitures, and gains and losses o n debt refinancings. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -11- Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (contin ued) Excess of Revenues Over Expenses: The consolidated statements o f operations and changes in net assets include excess of revenues over expenses from continuing operations as a performance indicator. Changes in unrestricted net assets that are excluded from excess of revenues over expenses from continuing operations include unrealized gains and losses on investments in other-tha n-trading securities, contributions of long-lived assets, use of restricted funds for capital additions, and gain s and losses from discontinued operations. Use of Estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial sta tements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US requires management to make estima tes and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the accomp anying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Reclassifications: Certain 2016 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation as a result of Walla Walla General Hospital ( WWGH) discontinued operations. Note B - Fair Value of Financial Instruments The System accounts for certain assets at fair value. A fair va lue hierarchy for valuation inputs has been established to prioritize the valuation inputs into three level s based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair va lue measurement is reported in one of the three levels determined by the lowest level input considered signific ant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are defined as: Level 1: Quoted prices are available in active markets for ide ntical assets as of the measurement date. Financial assets in Level 1 include US treasury securities, dom estic and foreign equities, and exchange- traded mutual funds. Level 2: Pricing inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not ac tive, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the mar ket or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Fina ncial assets in this category generally include government agencies and municipal bonds, asset-backed securitie s, and corporate bonds. Level 3: Pricing inputs are generally unobservable for the ass ets and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity fo r the investment. The System had no Level 3 investments at December 31, 2017 and 2016. There were no transfers of financial assets between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -12- Note B - Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) The fair value of the System's financial assets, measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2017, consists of the following: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Significant Identical Observable Instruments Inputs (Level 1) (Level 2) Totals Cash and cash equivalents $ 795,838 $ - $ 795,838 US government treasury obligations 335,251 - 335,251 US corporation and agency debentures - 16,819 16,819 US agency mortgage-backed securities - 7,623 7,623 Corporate securities - 392,035 392,035 Municipal bonds - 23,041 23,041 Mutual funds - fixed income 328,382 - 328,382 Mutual funds - equity 67,249 - 67,249 Total financial assets stated at fair value $ 1,526,720 $ 439,518 1,966,238 Commercial real estate 33,857 Other investments 117,335 Total cash and investments $ 2,117,430 Commercial real estate investments are recorded at cost or fair market value if donated. These investments are periodically reviewed for impairment and written down if necess ary. Other investments include retirement plan assets, joint ventures, and partnerships. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -13- Note B - Fair Value of Financial Instruments (continued) The fair value of the System's financial assets, measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2016, consists of the following: Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Significant Identical Observable Instruments Inputs (Level 1) (Level 2) Totals Cash and cash equivalents $ 747,986 $ - $ 747,986 US government treasury oblig ations 322,717 - 322,717 US corporation and agency debentures 26,708 26,708 US agency mortgage-backed securities - 13,448 13,448 Corporate debt secur ities - 356, 619 356,619 Municipal bonds - 26,650 26,650 Mutual funds - fixed income 183,877 - 183,877 Mutual funds - equity 117,289 - 117,289 Total financial assets stated at fair value $ 1,371,869 $ 423 ,425 1,795,294 Commercial real estate 35,954 Other investments 104,428 Total cash and investments $ 1,935,676 As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Level 2 instruments liste d in the fair value hierarchy tables above use the following valuation techniques and inputs: US corporation and agency deben tures: The fair value of invest ments in US corporation and agency debentures classified as Level 2 is primarily determined using consensus pricing methods of observable market-based data. Significant observable inputs include quotes , spreads, and data points for yield curves. US agency mortgage-backed securities: The fair value of US agen cy mortgage-backed securities classified as Level 2 is primarily determined using matrices. T hese matrices utilize observable market data of bonds with similar features, prepayment speeds, credit ratings, and discounted cash flows. Additionally, observed market move ments, tranche cash flows, an d benchmark yields are incorporated in the pricing models. Corporate debt securities: The fa ir value of investments in co rporate debt securities classified as Level 2 is primarily determined using techniques that are consistent wi th the market approach. Significant observable inputs include reported trades, dealer quotes, secur ity-specific characteristics, and multiple sources of spread data points in developing yield curves. Municipal bonds: The fair valu e of municipal bonds classified as Level 2 is determined using a market approach. The inputs include yield benchmark curves, prepayment speeds, and observable market data, such as institutional bids, dealer quotes, and two-sided market s. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -14- Note C - Patient Accounts Receivable The System's primary concentration of credit risk is patient ac counts receivable, which consists of amounts owed by various governmental agencies, insurance companies, and self-pay patients. The System manages its receivables by regularly reviewing its patient accounts and con tracts and by providing an appropriate allowance for contractual reimbursement, policy discounts, charity, and u ncollectible amounts. These allowances are estimated based upon an evaluati on of governmental reimbursemen ts, negotiated contracts, and historical payments. The System's reserve for self-pay patients, including the allowance for uncollectible accounts, charity care, and self-pay discounts, was approximately 95% and 94% of self-pay accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following is a summary of si gnificant concentrations of gro ss patient accounts receivable: December 31 2017 2016 Medicare 2.5 100% 100% Note D - Assets Whose Use is Limited The following is a summary of assets whose use is limited: December 31 2017 2016 Assets designated by the Board, primarily for property and equipment $ 122,248 $ 119,506 Less portion reported as current - (72) $ 122,248 $ 119,434 Investments held by trustees for: Debt service $ 13,135 $ 15,026 Future capital projects 10,815 18,458 160,677 Charitable annuities and 8,145 Total investments held by trustees 207,379 202,306 Less portion reported as current (46,871) (31,804) $ 160,508 $ 170,502 Donor-restricted investments for: and life tenancies 18,120 $ Other purposes 8,164 8,006 Total donor-restricted investments 26,284 24,558 Less portion reported as current - (2,924) $ 26,284 $ 21,634 Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -15- Note E - Investment Income Net realized investment income, including capital gains, intere st, and dividend income, includes the following: Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Investment earnings: Unrestricted and board-designated funds 22,700 of performance evalua tion, management considers in vestment earnings on bond and self-insurance trustee-held funds to be components of operating income. These earnings are used to pay the operating expenses of interest and insurance and are reported in other revenue. In vestment earnings on unrestricted and board- designated funds are components of nonoperating income and are reported on a separate line on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Changes in net unrealized gains and losses on other-than-tradin g securities, reported at fair value, are separately disclosed in the consolidated statements of operations and chan ges in net assets. Unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities re late principally to market c hanges in interest rates for similar types of securities. Since the System has the intent and ability to hold these securities for the foreseeable future, and it is more likely than not that the System will not be required to se ll the investments before their recovery, the declines are not reported as realized unless they are deemed to be other-than-temporary. In determining whether the losses are other-than-temporary, the System considers the l ength of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost or carrying value, the financial streng th of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the System to retain the security for a period of time sufficient t o allow for anticipated recovery or maturity. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -16- Note F - Property and Equipment The followin g is a summary of property and equipment: December 31 2017 2016 Land and improvements $ 221,925 $ 221,111 improvements 2,233,815 259,923 145,733 $ 1,853,850 $ 1,807,776 The System has commitments to complete certain construction pro jects approximating $186,698 (unaudited) at December 31, 2017. The System is in the process of developing internal use softwar e for clinical and financial operations. Depreciation expense for the software totaled $15,408 and $15,479 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amounts capitalized are included in property and equipment as follows: December 31 2017 2016 Equipment $ 208,577 $ 195,322 Less accumulated depreciation (109,382) progress 44,717 31,503 $ 128,712 $ 117,443 Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -17- Note G - Long-Term Debt A master note under the master bond indenture provides security for substantially all long-term debt. Under the terms of the master bond indenture, substantially all System co nsolidated entities are jointly and severally obligated for the payments to be made under the master note. In addition, security is pr ovided by a combination of bond insurance, funds held in trust of $13,135, and bank let ters of credit aggregating to $82,026 at December 31, 2017. Bonds are not secured by any property of the System. The System is obligated under va riable rate demand instruments, which are subject to certain market risks. The letters of credit, which the System intends to renew on a long- term basis, expire between 2019 and 2022 with the arrangements converting any unpaid amounts to term loans du e within three years after conversion. The term loans would bear interest based on prime or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Long-term debt has been issued primarily on a tax-exempt basis. The fair value of the System's long-term debt, including curren t maturities, is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates o ffered to the System for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of long-term debt was $1,851,137 and $1,678,380 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Based on the inputs and valuation techniques, the fair value of long-term debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Certain financing agreements impose limitations on the issuance of new debt by the System and require it to maintain specified financial ratios. Interest paid, net of amounts capitalized, totaled $49,380 and $44,747 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest capitalized totaled $3,810 and $3,211 in 2017 and 2016, respect ively. The System recorded operating lease expense amounting to $51,13 7 and $48,921 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The System was in compliance with its debt covenants at Decembe r 31, 2017. In December 2017, the System entered into taxable term loan agr eements for variable direct placement debt in the amount of $150,000. In September 2016, the System issued $280,010 of new bonds thro ugh the California Health Facilities Financing Authority (CHFFA) for the purpose of refinancing its 1998 CHFFA Series A, 2007 California Statewide Communities Development Authority (CSCDA) Series B, and 2009 CH FFA Series A bonds, as well as the 2007 CSCDA Series A bonds issued by Lodi Memorial Hospital. Th ese bond issues were refinanced with proceeds from the 2016 CHFFA Series A bonds, assets in trustee- held reserve accounts of the refinanced bonds, and a cash contribution. The 1998 CHFFA Series A bonds were ca lled and redeemed on Oc tober 8, 2016. The other three bond series were legally defeased with assets place d in an irrevocable trust and derecognized at the date of refunding. The extinguishment and defeasance of these bond issues resulted in a loss on refinancing of $31,459. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -18- Note G - Long-Term Debt (continued) The following is a summary of lo ng-term debt and capital lease obligations: Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Long-term bonds payable, with fixed rates currently ranging from 2.00% to 5.25%, payable in installments through 2045 $ 849,720 $ 866,785 Long-term bonds payable, with rates that vary with market conditi ons, payable in installments through 2041 252,040 258,085 Long-term notes payable, with fixed rates primarily ranging from 2.45% to 7.50%, payable in installments through 2046 360,471 365,742 Long-term notes payable, with rates that vary with market conditi ons, payable in installments through 2047 280,883 155,394 Net unamortized debt issuance costs an d original issue premium 43,966 47,102 1,787,080 1,693,108 Capital lease obligations 145 current maturities (37,570) (34,073) $ 1,749,655 $ 1,659,348 Scheduled maturities of long-term debt, capital lease obligatio ns, and minimum lease payments on noncancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2017: Long-term Debt and Operating Capital Leases Leases 2018 $ 34,874 $ 24,185 100,891 Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -19- Note H - Restricted Net Assets Net assets are restricted for the following purposes: Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Temporarily restricted: Equipment and buildings $ 35,779 $ 39,934 Patient care, education, research, and other 25,537 34,447 Time-restricted trusts held for unrestricted purposes 5,362 $ 77,454 Permanently restricted endowments $ 9,358 $ 7,397 Note I - Patient Service Revenue Patient service revenue after contractual allowances and discou nts and before provisions for bad debts, by major payor sources, was as follows: Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Medicare $ 1,352,244 $ 1,320,100 Medicaid 1,256,042 1,149,042 Others 1,201,388 1,173,309 Net patient service revenue $ 3,809,674 $ 3,642,451 The System has agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to the System at amounts different from its established rates. Payment arrangements include prospe ctively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounted charges, fee schedules, and per di em payments. The health care industry is subject to complex laws and regulations of federal, state, and local go vernments. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and inte rpretation, as well as regulatory actions unknown or unasserted at this time. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, government health care program par ticipation requirements, reimbursement laws and regulations, anti-kickback a nd anti-referral laws and false claims prohibitions, and in the case of tax-exempt hospitals, the requirements of tax-exemption. In recent years, government activity has increased with respect to investigations and allegations c oncerning possible violations o f reimbursement, false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-referral statutes and regulations by health care providers . The System operates a compliance program, which reviews compliance with government health care program re quirements and investigates allegations of non-compliance received from internal and external sources. Fro m time to time, findings may result in repayment of monies previously received from government payors and/or commercial payors and payment of penalties. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibil ity that the recorded estimates may change by a material amount in the near term. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -20- Note I - Patient Service Revenue (continued) Differences between original estimates and subsequent revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made. Subsequent r evisions compared favorably to original estimates by approximately $23,301 and $29,866 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, res pectively. The System recorded revenue from state programs for serving a d isproportionate share of Medicaid and low- income patients in the amount of $42,920 and $52,917 in 2017 an d 2016, respectively, including final settlements on prior years. The State of California enacted legislation for a hospital fee program to fund certain Medi-Cal coverage expansions. The program charges hospitals a quality assurance f ee that is used to obtain federal matching funds for Medi-Cal with the proceeds redistributed as supplemental pa yments to California hospitals that treat Medi- Cal patients. There are two hospital fee programs that had acti vity in 2016 and 2017: a 36-month hospital fee program covering the period from January 1, 2014 through Decemb er 31, 2016, and a 30-month hospital fee program covering the period from January 1, 2017 through June 3 0, 2019. Historically, the System's policy was to record revenue and expense upo n approval of the program. Dur ing 2017, the System dete rmined that, for all hospital fee programs through 2017, the supplemental payments m et all criteria related to revenue recognition and the quality assurance fees are both probable and estimatabl e. Accordingly, all related supplemental payments have been recognized as revenue and related quality as surance fees have been recognized as expense as of December 31, 2017. The Syst em recorded a net benefit of $ 168,559 during the fourth quarter of 2017, with $70,818 from the 36-month program, and $97,741 from the 30 -month program. Federal and state payments received from these programs are included in net patient revenu e, and fees paid or payable to the state and California Health Foundation and Tr ust (CHFT) are included in p urchased services and other expenses, as follows: Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Net patient service revenue $ 508,307 $ 346,116 Purchased services and other expenses: Quality assurance fees 193,783 165,785 CHFT fees (net refund) 3,114 (60) Total purchased services and other expenses 196,897 165,725 Income from operations $ 311,410 $ 180,391 Accrued net receivables related to the quality assurance progra ms are included in receivables from third-party payors, and amounted to $285,484 and $132,882 as of December 31 , 2017 and 2016, respectively. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -21- Note J - Retirement Plan Most of the System's operating entities participate in a single defined contribution plan (the \"Plan\"). The Plan is exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1 974. The Plan provides, among other things, that the employer will contribute 3% of wages plus additional a mounts for employees earning more than the Social Security wage base capped by the IRS compensation limit for the Plan year. Additionally, the Plan provides that the employer will match 50% of the employee's con tributions up to 4% of the contributing employee's wages. Substantially all full-time employees who are at least 18 years of age are eligible for coverage in the Plan. The cost to the System for the Plan is in cluded in employee compensation in the amount of $57,763 and $48,603 for the years ended December 31, 2017 an d 2016, respectively. Effective September 2016, the Sys tem implemented new deferred c ompensation agreements (the \"Agreements\") with ten executives. The Agreements are structure d such that the System will have no future obligation to fund any additiona l amounts beyond an initial $34 ,500 that was set aside to fund the premium payments on various split-dollar life insurance policies. The c ash flows received by the executives following their retirement will be funded w ith loans taken against the li fe insurance contracts, which can be drawn by the executives post-retirement. Related to this transaction, the Sy stem has recorded $14,300 and $14,700 as prepaid insurance contracts at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively , and $15,500 and $14,800 of cash surrender value in other assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respective ly. The System recorded $5,000 of investment expense in the 2016 consolidated financial statements. The com pensation expense in 2017 and 2016 related to the Agreements was not material. Note K - Self-Insurance Liability Programs The System has established a separate self-insured revocable tr ust (the \"System Trust\") that covers the System's entities for professional and general liabilit y claims up to $7 ,500 per occurrence and $22,500 in aggregate. The System contracts with Adhealth, Limited (Adhealth), a Bermuda c ompany, to provide e xcess coverage for professional and general liability claims that exceed the self- insured revocable trust limits. Adhealth provided excess coverage with aggregate and per claim limits of $132,500 for professional and general liability claims for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $107, 500 for professi onal liability claims a nd $132,500 for general liability claims for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adhealth has purchased reinsurance through commercial insurers for 100% of the excess limits of coverage. Claim liabilities (reserves) for future losses and related loss adjustment expenses for professional liability claims have been determined by an actuary at the present value of futu re claim payments using a 2% discount rate for program years 2017 and 2016. Such claim reserves are based on t he best data available to the System; however, these estimates are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. Accordingly, there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material change to the estimated reserves will occur in the near term. The System Trust's accrued liability for pr ofessional and general liabilit y claims is included in the consolidated balance sheets in the amount of $139,682 and $143,029 at December 31, 2 017 and 2016, respectively. The System has a 50% ownership position in Adhealth at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and accounts for its investment using the equity method of accounting. The cost of a cquiring commercial insurance by Adhealth is reflected as an expense in the c onsolidated statements of opera tions and changes in net assets. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -22- Note K - Self-Insurance Liability Programs (continued) The System maintains a self-insured workers' compensation plan to pay for the cost of workers' compensation claims. The System has entered into an excess insurance agreeme nt with an insurance company to limit its losses on claims. The cost o f workers' compensation claims is accrued using actuarially determined estimates that are based on historical factors. Such claim reserves are based on t he best data available to the System; however, these estimates are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability. Accordingly, there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material change to the estimated reserves will occur in the near term. Workers' compensation claim liabilities have been determined by an actuary at the present value of future claim payments using a 2% discount rate for program years 2017 and 2016. The System's accrued liability for workers' compensation claims is recorded in the consolidated ba lance sheets in the amount of $68,019 and $72,910 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Note L - Related-Party Transactions The System had transactions with organizations that are conside red related parties. The amounts receivable from related parties are reported in the accompanying consolidated f inancial statements as other receivables of $10,266 and $7,902 and notes receivable of $6,294 and $17,341 a t December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Note M - Commitments and Contingencies Certain member organizations are involved in litigation and inv estigations arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, certain mem ber organizations in the ordi nary course of business identified matters that they have reported to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), CMS contractors, or Medicaid/Medi-Cal contractors. Such disclosures typically invol ve simple repayment of affected claims; however, federal and state contractors may refer these matters to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General to investigate whether certain memb er organizations have submitted false claims to the Medicare and Medicaid programs or have violated other laws. Submission of false claims or violation of other laws can result in substantial civil and/or criminal pena lties and fines, including treble damages and/or possible debarment from future participation in such programs. The System is committed to cooperating in such investigations as they arise. Although management does not beli eve these matters will have a material adverse effect on the System's consolidated financial position, there c an be no assurance that this will be the case. In November of 2017, the System began an internal investigation of an issue that may hav e affected the quality of patient admissions documentation. Once identified, measures were taken to ensure that, on a go forward basis, the issue does not affect the quality of such documentat ion. The System is currently undertaking a detailed review to assess the number and kinds of claims that have been paid as a result of this issue that may require disclosure to the related payors. At this time, the System cann ot quantify whether there is a need for any repayment or the amount of any such repayment. The System is co ntinuing its investigation and will take all steps necessary to ensure it is compliant with claims processin g and compliance reporting requirements. There can be no assurance that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -23- Note N - FEMA Financial Grants Several of the System's hospitals are located in areas of frequ ent earthquake activity a nd have sustained damage from earthquakes in the past. Three System hospitals received $ 156,150 of grant funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEM A) for repair of damage and sei smic structural upgrades, and all of these funds were recorded in the accomp anying consolidated financial statements in years prior to 2017. FEMA grant funds received for capitalized expenditures are acco unted for as an exchange transaction and are reported as deferred revenue. Def erred revenue of $83,821 and $ 88,542 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, is recorded as other noncurrent liabilities. Afte r completion of a project, the related deferred revenue is amortized over the expected useful life of the asset and recorded as other revenue. Amortization of deferred revenue totaled $4,721 and $4,842 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Note O - Discontinued Operations In April 2017, management committed to a plan to either transfe r the assets of WWGH to another healthcare entity or to discontinue operating the hospital and sell its no n-financial assets. As a resu lt of this plan, operations ceased and WWGH was removed from the Obligated Group in July 20 17. Accordingly, all WWGH activity is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and chan ges in net assets as a component of net loss from discontinued operations, and the applicable assets, primarily p roperty and equipment, are reported in the consolidated balance sheets as asset s held for sale. No further depreciation was recorded subsequent to the commitment date. All assets held for sale as of December 31, 20 17, were subsequently sold in March 2018. Note P - Lease of Adventist Health Medical Center Tehachapi Val ley In 2016, the System entered into an agreement with Tehachapi Va lley Healthcare District (the \"District\") to take over the operations of the hospital for a period of 30 years, beginning November 1, 2016. A new hospital is currently under construction, and is expected to be complete d by the summer of 2018. The terms of the agreement specify that the System will pay the District the rem aining construction costs of the new hospital. As a result of the investment during the construction period, the System was considered to be the owner of the building during the construction period under Financial Account ing Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 840, Leases. As of December 31, 2017, the System had paid $28,309, which i s included in property and equipment on the accompanying consolid ated financial statements. The System estimates that the remaining cost to complete the hospital is $ 13,020 (unaudited). Note Q - New Accounting Pronouncements In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-14, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958): Presentation of Financial Statements of Not-for-Profit Entities. The new guidance simplifies a nd improves the face of the financial statements and enhances the disclosures in the footno tes of not-for-profit entities (NFPs). The most significant change is that net assets will now be reported in two classes: net assets without donor restrictions and net assets with donor restrictions. Other simplifications a nd improvements will be made on how NFPs present information about liquidity, financial performance, and cash flows. The System is evaluating the potential impact of this guidance, which will be effective in 2 018. Adventist Health Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued (In thousands of dollars) -24- Note Q - New Accounting Pronouncements (continued) In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The amendments in this update require lessees to put most leases onto the balance sheet. This guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets a nd liabilities and increasing disclosure requirements about leasing arrangements. The System is evaluati ng the potential impact of this guidance, which will be effective in 2019. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which will supersede virtually all revenue recognition guidance in U. S. GAAP. The new standard provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers (unless the con tracts are in the scope of other U.S. GAAP requirements). The guidance also provides a model for the measu rement and recognition of gains and losses on the sale of certain non-financial assets, such as property and equipment, including real estate. The effective date for this standard was delayed with the issuance of ASU No. 2015 -14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and will be effective in 2018. The System adopted this guidance as of the January 1, 2018, effective date, using the full retrospec tive method of transition. The Sy stem primarily used a por tfolio approach to apply the new model to classes of customers with similar characterist ics. The impact of adopting the new standard on the System's 2017 and 2016 total revenues and results of operat ions is not material, as the analysis of its contracts under the new guidance supports the recognition of re venue consistent with its current revenue recognition model. Note R - Subsequent Events In 2017, the System entered into an Affiliation Agreement with The Fremont-Rideout Health Group, located in Marysville, California, to become the sole member of The Fremon t-Rideout Health Group. This agreement was approved by the State's Attorney General in March 2018. The aff iliation was effective April 1, 2018. This acquisition will expand the System's mission in the Northern Ca lifornia Region. Adventist Health Center-Portland and Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) entered into a Health System Agreement, an Operating Agreement, and an Academic Affil iation Agreement, effective January 1, 2018. This agreement makes OHSU and the System a unified clinic al system in the Portland metropolitan market with a shared certain financial metrics. The affiliation applies to OHSU's Portlandarea clinical services and activities and Adventist Medi cal Center-Portland. The agree ments do not include OHSU's nonmetro area clinical activities and services or the other System hospitals. Under the agreement, each organization will retain its existing hospital licenses, employees, and ownership of ass ets. The System has evaluated subsequent events and disclosed all ma terial events through April 20, 2018, the date the accompanying consolidated fin ancial statements were issued.
