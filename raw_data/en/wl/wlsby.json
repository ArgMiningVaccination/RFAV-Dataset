GLEN L. RUTHERFORD, et al., Respondents On Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit BRIEF AMICUS CURIAE OF THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, INC. IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER, THE UNITED ST ATES STATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY The American Cancer Society has a substantial in\u00ad trest in the outcome of this proceeding. Briefly stated, the American public and the medical profession look to the American Cancer Society to provide the most up-to\u00ad date and accurate information about cancer. Since early and effective treatment of cancer is a life and death 2 matter, one of the areas in the forefront of the public and professional questioning addressed to the Society per\u00ad tains to unproven methods of cancer treatment. In its efforts to respond to the need for information in this area, the Society established a committee on unproven methods and maintains one of the largest reference cen\u00ad ters for the collection and dissemination of data concern\u00ad ing the subject. In furtherance of its obligation to the American public and the medical profession to uncover and disseminate the facts relating to unproven methods of cancer treatment, the Society participated in the Food and Drug Administration rulemaking proceeding which followed the legal parameters set by the Court of Appeals in Rutherford v. United States, 542 F.2d 1137, 1140-43 (10th Cir. 1974). (Petitioners' Appendix at 51d). The Society also participated as amicus curiae in the proceedings on appeal which are the subject of this petition. (Petitioners' Appendix at 10a). The outcome of the Government's appeal which the Society supports will be largely determinative of whether the protections provided by Congress to the American public in the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act will survive or whether they will fall, depriving both the consumer and the practicing physician of the first line of defense established by Congress at the request of President Ken\u00ad nedy who stated: There is no way of measuring the needless suffering, the money innocently squandered, and the protrac\u00ad tion of illnesses resulting from the use of ... in\u00ad effective drugs. The physician and consumer should have the as\u00ad surance from an impartial scientific source, that any drug or therapeutic device on the market today is safe and effective for its intended use .... 1962 U.S. Code Cong. & Admins. News at 4143-44. Either the impact of the Rutherford Court of Appeals decision, 3 which writes off the safety/efficacy provisions of the federal drug laws as they apply to the terminally ill, or the impact of the alternative grounds for decision of the district court, which finds both a grandfather clause ex\u00ad emption for Laetrile and a right of privacy in its use, will obviously affect the Society in its role as primary information source to the general public and the medical profession for accurate information on unproven methods of cancer treatment. Should the Rutherford decision stand, another indica\u00ad tion of its impact on the public, and the Society as its information resource lies in the resurgence, since mid- 1976 when the Rutherford suit became heavily pub\u00ad licized, of inquiries about a number of unproven methods of cancer treatment in addition to laetrile. Prior to the Rutherford publicity, some of these methods were quies\u00ad cent for months or years or came to the Society's atten\u00ad tion at long scattered intervals. Those unproven methods include, e.g., the biological theory of ionization; wobe mugos; herbal remedies such as one called essiac; chela\u00ad tion therapy and alleged vaccines combined with special diets. By way of specific illustration, a complaint for for\u00ad feiture is pending before a district court in California 1 involving: \"Wobe Mugos products in the treatment of Cancer, Herpes Zoster and Herpes simplex; and Wobenzym preparations in the treatment of cancer, arteriosclerosis, angina, asthma, arthritis, bursitis, circulatory disorders including diabetic circulatory disease, intermittent claudication, phlebitis and thrombophlebitis, varicose ulcers, pneumonia, cysti- 1 United States v. Articles Drug consisting Court, Central District of California) ( September 28, 1978). 4 tis, emphysema, and gynecological and urological in\u00ad flammatory disorders.\" If the Court of Appeals' decision is permitted to stand, it will open the floodgates and permit the public, par\u00ad ticularly those with life-threatening illness who are choice prey, to be inundated by worthless and therefore unsafe and dangerous drugs. The Society's interest lies in speak\u00ad ing out for the continuation of the proper balance of manufacturer and consumer interests which currently exists in the statutory scheme relating to drugs. It would be a grave disservice to the public if this regulatory scheme were undermined on the basis of a Court of Appeals or on the alternative grounds advanced by the district court opinion which we demonstrate below is unsound as a matter of law. The American Cancer Society has received the consent of counsel for all parties to file this brief amicus curiae in accordance with Rule 42 of this Court. Those permis\u00ad sions are attached to the original of this brief filed with the Supreme Court. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT The court of appeals exemption of the terminally ill from the pre-marketing requirements of the federal drug laws. The plain language of the federal drug laws does not signal any exemption from coverage for the terminally ill. To the contrary, the legislative and administrative history of those laws and their interpretation by the courts show a specific intent to safeguard consumers with life-threatening and terminal illnesses. The hold\u00ad ing of the court of appeals exempting the terminal from these pre-marketing clearance provisions runs against this intent and also contra to the decisions of other federal courts who, faced with drug law challenges by a patient class of the terminally ill, have held these laws applicable to that class. Further, although it is theo-5 retically possible to formulate a definition of terminally ill, the objective application of that definition is improb\u00ad able. The record in this proceeding shows abuses which will permit other than those certified as terminally ill to have access to laetrile and those abuses have also sur\u00ad f aced in other proceedings in federal and state courts. Finally, the public interest requires application of the premarketing clearance requirements of the federal drug laws for the benefit of all consumers including the termi\u00ad nal. When the nebulous benefits of access to a drug generally recognized to be ineffective and unsafe to the in-fact terminally ill, those with only a few weeks or months to live, against the very real threat of exemption and broadening of access to those whose cancer is in the early stages, treatable and merely life-threatening. . The district court's application of the 1962 grandfather clause. The district court improperly shifted the burden of proceeding and proof in the rulemaking proceeding from the drug proponents on whom its properly rests to the Food and Drug Administration. However, even under the improperly shifted burdens of proof, the record establishes the error of the district court exempting Laetrile from the premarketing requirements of the fed\u00ad eral drug laws by application of the 1962 grandfather clause. Laetrile does not satisfy the grandfather clause requirements of ( 1) consistency and predictability in drug formulation, dosage, route of administration, mechanism of action, claims and conditions for usage and effect; (2) its use prior to 1962 was investigational and not commercial; and (3) it is not generally recognized by qualified experts in cancer treatment as safe or effective. Where life-threatening illness is involved the administra\u00ad tion interpretation of \"safety\" under the 1938 Act period included toxicity and effectiveness. This admin\u00ad istrative interpretation was adopted by Congress when it considered the 1962 Drug Amendments and thus Lae\u00ad trile must be generally recognized as effective as well as 6 safe (non-toxic) before it\" can receive the exemption con\u00ad templated by the 1962 grandfather clause. The district court's holding that laetrile use in personal health care is protected by the Constitution. An analysis of this Court's decisions regarding \"privacy\" in the con\u00ad text in which they were rendered shows that the selec\u00ad tion of a particular drug or medical treatment procedure is not invested with privacy status. The decision whether to receive medical treatment may be constitutionally pro\u00ad tected but the choice among treatment alternatives is not within the scope of any right recognized by this Court. Further, if a privacy right is found by this Court, the nexus of the premarketing provisions of the federal drug laws with the preservation and protection of the health of the cancer patient justifies government regulation under both the rational relationship and compelling interest tests. ARGUMENT I. THE COURT OF APPEALS REVISION OF THE FEDERAL DRUG LAWS TO EXEMPT THE TER\u00ad MINALLY ILL NOT ONLY FLIES IN THE FACE OF CONGRESSIONAL INTENT BUT ALSO EF\u00ad FECTIVELY DEPRIVES THOSE WITH LIFE\u00ad THREATENING ILLNESS OF THE PROTEC\u00adTIONS OF THE ACT A. Overview of the Problem The Court of Appeals did not address the issues of whether Laetrile was generally recognized as safe and effective among qualified experts, nor whether it is grand\u00ad fathered, nor did it address the additional ground of decision advanced by the district court-the alleged Con\u00ad stitutional right to privacy. Rather, the court of ap\u00ad peals held \"as a matter of law that the 'safety' and 'effectiveness' requirements of the statute as now written have no application to terminally ill cancer patients who 7 desire to take the drug [Laetrile] intravenously.\" (Pe\u00ad titioner's Appendix 7a, hereinafter stated as \"Pet. App.\"). This holding has a surf ace appeal. If a person is going to die, why not indulge him by permitting access to any alleged cancer remedy he may wish to try. The reasons for denial of such permission are many. The court of appeals assumes that an objective stand\u00ad ard is available or can be formulated and applied to de\u00ad termine who is \"terminally ill.\" This assumption is in conflict with the findings made by the Commissioner in the Laetrile decision, (Pet. App. at 267a-270a). The thrust of those findings is that cancer is a disease that affects individual patients and that physicians dealing with these patients on an individual basis find it diffi\u00ad cult to distinguish the in-fact terminal from non-terminal cancer patients with any accuracy. The practical and ethical problems of carving out an exception for the terminally ill from the Act was pointedly addressed by Dr. Samuel Klagsbrun in his affidavit (Ad. R. 433) .2 Use of the term \"terminally ill\" is inappropriate when dealing with an individual cancer patient. Al\u00ad though specific forms of cancer may have a statis\u00ad tically expectable mortality rate, that rate is mean\u00ad ingless when applied to an individual patient. On\u00ad cologists are all familiar with experiences where severe cancers, which were statistically considered to be hopeless, have, in some small percentages of cases, undergone a sudden remission. It would be tragic to condemn any individual cancer patient to 2 The record transmitted to this Court made a distinction be\u00ad tween the record compiled during the Laetrile rulemaking proceed\u00ad ing and the record specifically developed before the district court. This distinction will be observed in the Society's brief. References to the administrative record will be cited Ad.R. - ; or administra\u00ad tive transcript, Ad.Tr. -; references to the court record will be cited Ct.R. - ; or if a district court hearing transcript is involved Ct.Tr.-. 8 death because, as a statistical matter, that patient's particular form of cancer may not be curable. A decision to allow patients who are diagnosed as having a cancer which, as a statistical matter ex\u00adpected to lead to their death, would move all such patients away from orthodox therapy and condemn even the individual patient whose cancer may un\u00ad expectedly move into remission to Laetrile, a worth\u00ad less and ineffective drug. In addition, such a deci\u00ad sion would thereafter remove the patients from the possibility of receiving continuing chemotherapy or radiation therapy which could enhance the effects of \u00b7 any remission. Most physicians have undergone the experience of predicting the moment of death and have unexpectedly and repeatedly been proven wrong to a considerable degree. The prolongation of life, therefore, becomes a goal, not simply for the sake of prolongation, but also to render patients available to either a recent advance in chemotherapy or sim\u00ad ply to enhance the quality of the time left available to the patients. Even if we assume theoretically that the phrase \"termi\u00ad nally ill\" may be capable of objective application, 11 in practice, in the district court proceeding, tight objective standard criteria court proceeding, tight objective stand- 3 Robert S.K. Young, M.D. (Ct.R. 210-211) indicated before the district court what he considered to be the criteria for determining whether a patient is terminal: \"a. There must be histologic evidence of a malignancy in the patient. b. The malignancy must be characterized as a disease with a high and predictable mortality. It must also be rapidly progressive. The malignancy will result in death in a relatively short period of time, i.e., within a few weeks or within a few months.\" c. There must be no treatment recognized by experts as safe and effective for the disease, or therapies recognized as safe and effective for the disease have been totally exhausted, and further treatment would not be reasonably expected to benefit the patient. 9 ard criteria has been eschewed.4 Instead, the district court proceeding employed an affidavit process that does not present a reasonable certainty that laetrile access will be confined to those who are in fact terminally ill. 5 Further, the record in the district court, discussed in Section D hereto shows the abuse of the affidavit process to permit importation of laetrile far in excess of patient requirements to be disposed of to cancer patients who have not been certified terminally ill by affidavit. 4 The FDA in its policy of the implementation of the affidavit process for access to laetrile put into effect by the district court to assume that the legitimately terminal alone were permitted access to laetrile, also required the patients affidavit subjects to possess a doctors affidavit that they will probably die within a few weeks or a few months and also to show proof that they had a medical exam within the last three months (Ct.R. 309-310). The Government contended that this would be the only way to assure that the patients receiving laetrile were in fact terminal (Ct.R. 315-316). The rationale behind this information requirement was explained by Dr. Young at Ct.R. 331-334: \"The essential first step in making an accurate medical diag\u00ad nosis of a malignancy, as opposed to mere speculation as to a patient's condition, is the obtaining of histologic evidence and characterization of the disease. This information com\u00ad piled with a thorough physical examination and appropriate diagnostic laboratory tests including radiologic and scintilla\u00ad tion studies and intimate knowledge of the natural history of the disease enables a physician realistically and reasonably to reach a conclusion as to whether a particular tumor can be characterized as one which is usually rapidly progressive and which, if untreated, normally results in a high and pre\u00ad dictable mortality rate.\" 5 The district court's reaction to this rationale was to add a condition that the date of examination be noted on the affidavit form (Ct.R. 337-338). Further, since the affidavit does not require a physician to refuse to execute the affidavit if orthodox modalities are not also employed or if other orthodox therapies of benefit are available but can justify execution on presence of progressive cancer plus informed consent, there is no assurance that only those without medical alternatives will legally import laetrile. See e.g., Gt.R. 481-484,490,493,496,499,502. 10 In addition, a laetrile proceeding involving a minor, shows that the term \"cancer\" has been incorrectly treated as synonymous with \"terminal\" to obtain access to the drug. In the proceeding involving a minor, a physician has stated that even if he did not believe a patient termi\u00ad nal, he would so certify to assure the patient's access to laetrile. These aspects of exemption and the effect of exemption on the larger class of cancer patients who disease is merely life-threatening are discussed in detail in Section D at pp. 23-33 infra. However, the most significant ob\u00ad stacle to the exemption created by the court of appeals springs from its absolute inconsistency with the intent of Congress as expressed initially in the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and culminating in the 1962 Drug Amendments, discussed immediately below. B. From the Exercise of Federal Authority Over Drugs Initially By The Act of 1906, And As Amend\u00ad ed, The Terminally Ill Lay Within The Special Protection Of The Acts The medical and popular press in the early 1900's re\u00ad flected the sense of the country at that time that the words cancer and terminal illness were interchangeable. E. Cuyler Hammond, D.Sc., Director of Statistical Research Section of the American Cancer Society, writing in 3 Can\u00ad cer 417 ( Butterworth & Co., London, 1958) described the public's impression of cancer in the first quarter of this century as \"incurable\" and further stated that this conception was shared by a large proportion of the medi\u00ad cal profession. This impression was certainly borne out by the literature which reported the survival rate for, e.g., uterine cancer in 1900, to be as low as 2.8%,6 6 T.S. Cullen, Cancer of the Uterus (1900). See also, E.C. Ham\u00ad mond, \"Cancer Prevention of Comparative Risks\", 19 Archives Health 395 (1969); and see J.S. Bloodgood, \"Re\u00ad sponsibility of the Medical Profession for Cancer Education, with 11 These statistics improved somewhat. Indeed, between 1935-1940, the five year survival rate for all sites of cancer combined reached 25 % , by 1951 it reached 32 % . 7 However, even in 1967, public and physician reaction to the term cancer still equated it with a death sentence: Cancer has many unconscious meanings and f anta\u00ad sies associated with it. Whatever the unconscious feelings which it stirs, typically it is feared con\u00ad sciously as a process equated with suffering and certain death . . . People continue to think of cancer as 'the killer.' What is impressive is that the doctors themselves feel very much the same way. It was not patients who described the diagnosis as a 'death warrant' or 'a date of execution.' The internist who referred to cancer as an 'incurable disease with an inevitable demise' expressed a view which was not atypical.18 As late as the summer of 1977, in Hearings before Sena\u00ad tor Edward Kennedy's Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research,1) Lewis Thomas, M.D., Director of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, observed that \"For many patients and their families, the very word cancer is perceived as a death sentence. It is widely Special Reference to Cancer of the Cervix\", 15 American Journal of Cancer 1579 (1931) (cancer of the cervix is today predominantly a hopeless disease). 1 E.C. Hammond, \"The Possibility of Improving Cancer Cure Rates at the Present Time\", Cancer, May-June 1957 at 581-582; Proceedings of the Third National Cancer Conference 910 (1957). 8 Donald Oken, \"What to Tell Cancer Patients: A Study of Medi\u00ad cal Attitudes\", reprinted in Weir, Ethical Issues in Death and Dying (1977) at 21. 9 Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Committee on Human Resources, \"Evalua\u00ad tion of Information on Which the FDA Based Its Decision To Ban The Drug Laetrile From Interstate Commerce\", 95th Cong., 1st Sess (1977) [\"Laetrile Hearings\"]. 12 believed to be an inexorable and agonizing process, with no way out but death.\" 10 The early concern of the public and the press that the \"seriously\" or \"terminally\" ill be protected from useless nostrums is perhaps best exemplified by a series of ar\u00ad ticles by Samuel Hopkins Adams published in Collier's Weekly in 1906. These articles sought to enlighten the general public regarding the effects of various patent legislation regulation drugs.11 A segment of the series contained the following passage, entitled, \"Preying on the Incurables\" : Incurable disease is one of the strongholds of the patent-medicine business. The ideal patron, viewed in the light of profitable business, is the victim of some slow and wasting ailment in which recurrent hope inspires to repeated experiments with any \"cure\" that offers. In the columns of almost every newspaper you may find promises to cure consump\u00ad tion. Consumption is a disease absolutely incurable by any medicine ... This is thoroughly and defi\u00ad nitely understood by all medical and scientific men. Nevertheless there are in the patent-medicine world a set of harpies who, for their own business inter- 1\u00b70 Laetrile Hearings, supra at 13. This popular belief contrasts strongly with the actual statistics relating to survival from cancer due to earlier diagnosis and the steady improvement in surgical, x-ray and chemical approaches to the management of cancer. In the 1900's few cancer patients had any hope of long-term survival. In the 1930's less than one-in-five were alive at least five years after treatment. In the 1950's it was one-in-four. Now the ratio of patients alive after five years of disease is one in three. With even earlier diagnosis and prompt treatment, half of those who have cancer could be saved. See American Cancer Society, 1977 Cancer Facts and Figures, and see the 5 year survival statistics for specific sites of cancer when early diagnosis is made infra at note 30 which shows survivals of up to 86% of selected sites. 11 See Cramp, Nostrums & Quackery (1912) for a compilation of the Colliers articles and a discussion of their effect on the food and drug legislation of 1906. 13 ests deliberately foster in the mind of the unf ortu\u00ad nate sufferer from tuberculosis the belief that he can be saved by the use of some absolutely fraudu\u00ad lent nostrum. Many of these consumption cures con\u00ad tain drugs which hasten the progress of the disease . . . Others are comparatively harmless in them\u00ad selves, but by their fervent promises of rescue they delude the sufferer into misplacing his reliance and forfeiting his only chance by neglecting those rigidly careful habits of life which alone can conquer the \"white plague.\" One and all, the men who advertise medicines to cure consumption deliberately traffic in human life.12 The inclusion of several of the Colliers Articles in the Congressional Record 13 and also numerous citations in the Pure Food and Drug Act debates of reported frauds perpetrated upon the victims of such serious illness as cancer, consumption and diabetes in the form of spurious claims for cures,14 indicates a significant concern with those illnesses which in 1906 were \"terminal\" and by inference a determination by Congress that the \"termi\u00ad nally ill\" as a class would be protected by the legislation. In face of this concern over the application of the 1906 Act to cancer, consumption and other illness which were then considered fatal, the Congress expressed dis\u00ad belief when the Supreme Court in United States v. Johnson, 221 U.S. 488 (1911), a case which concerned a purported treatment for cancer, over a strong dissent by Justice Hughes, held that the 1906 Act did not apply to misrepresentations of facts relating to the ability of a drug to treat or cure a disease, but rather, only as to whether the ingredients used in the drug were properly stated on the label. 12 48 Cong.

Rec. 1416, 9073 14 In prompt response, President Taft, on June 21, 1911, in a message to Congress, urged action to protect the seriously ill against statements of curative effect on drugs that are contrary to fact and that seduce the ill away from proven medical treatments: An evil which menaces the general health of the people strikes at the life of the Nation. In my opin\u00ad ion, the sale of dangerously adulterated drugs, or the sale of drugs under knowing false claims as to their effect on disease, constitutes such an evil and warrants me in calling the matter to the attention of the Congress. Fraudulent misrepresentations of the curative value of nostrumes not only operate to defraud purchasers but are a distinct menace to the public health. There are none so credulous as sufferers from disease. The need is urgent for legislation which will prevent the raising of false hopes of speedy cures of serious ail\u00ad ments by misstatements of facts as to worthless mixtures on which the sick will rely while their diseases progress unchecked.JJS The Congress reacted to this call for action by passing the Sherley Amendment to the Act [Act of August 23, 1912, 37 Stat. 416, ch. 352] which provided that mis\u00ad statements regarding curative or therapeutic effects of a drug or device fall within the ambit of the Act. In commentary upon the Sherley Amendments to the Act in the 1913 Report of the Bureau of Chemistry, Bureau Chief Carl L. Alsberg notes the early successes of the Amendment in terms of the curative claims found on medicinal labels. According to Alsberg, \"Claims that preparations are cures for such serious diseases as tu- 15 48 Cong. Rec. 11322 (1911). See also, Belmont Laboratories v. FTC, 103 F.2d 538 (3rd Cir. 1939). 15 berculosis or cancer do not appear on the labels as often as formerly.\" 16 The statutes extended protection afforded to those who suffer from untreatable or incurable disease is ap\u00ad parent from the opinion of Justice Hughes applying the Sherley Act Amendment to the 1906 Act in Seven Cases ... Eckman's Alternative et al. v. United States, 239 U.S. 510, 514 (1916). Justice Hughes speaking for the Court, specifically upheld the following libel as a matter subject to prosecution under the Act as amended: [The label] conveys the impression to purchasers that said article or drugs will cure tuberculosis, or consumption, whereas, in truth and in fact, said articles of drugs would not cure tuberculosis, or consumption, there being no medicinal substances known at present which can be relied upon for the effective treatment or cure of tuberculosis, or con\u00ad sumption. (emphasis added). The concern of Congress and the courts with the as\u00ad surance that the federal drug laws protect those with terminal or life-threatening was closely followed in the administrative interpretation of the Act. The admin\u00ad istrative interpretation 11 of the federal drug laws ex- 16 Federal Food and Cosmetic Law, Administrative Reports, 1907- 1949, CCH, Food Law Institute Series (1951). 17 Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Antitrust & Monopoly, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. on the \"Drug Industry Antitrust Act\", Part 5 at 2588. (emphasis added) In testimony before Congress, the FDA stressed that under its view of existing law, the safety of a non-toxic drug could be construed to include efficacy only where the disease involved is life-threatening. See S. Rep. No. 1744 (part 1) And see Hear\u00ad ings on Drug Safety Before a Subcommittee of the H. Comm. on Government Operations, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, 150, 183-186 (Commissioner Larrick) and Hearings on Drug Efficacy Before A Subcommittee of the H. Committee on Government Operations, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 228 (Commissioner Ley). To the same effect see Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law Administrative Reports 1907-1949 at 927. 16 tend special protection to those with life-threatening or terminal illnesses. The FDA construed the language in the 1938 Drug Act, which required new drugs to show \"safety\", also includes \"efficacy\" : It is important to recognize that evaluating eff ec\u00ad tiveness is not a new concept in the administration of the food and drug law. In some instances the decision as to safety of a new drug necessarily re\u00ad quires an evaluation of effectiveness. If the drug is offered for treatment of progressive or life threat\u00ad ening diseases, such as cancer, or if the drug is seriously toxic or has alarming side effects we now consider its effectiveness. In such cases the determi\u00ad nation of safety is in the light of the purpose of the new drug provisions, inseparable from considera\u00ad tion of the drug's effectiveness.\" 118 This prior administrative practice and its special, pro\u00ad tective coverage for those with life threatening or progres\u00ad sive ( terminal) disease was expressly recognized, en\u00ad dorsed and continued by Congress in the 1962 Drug Amendments. The Food and Drug Administration now requires, in determining whether a \"new drug\" is safe, a showing as to the drug's effectiveness where the drug is offered for use in the treatment of a life\u00ad threatening disease, or where it appears that the \"new drug\" will occasionally produce serious toxic or even lethal effects so that only its usefulness would justify the risks involved in its use. In such cases, the determination of safety is, in the light of the purposes of the new drug provisions, consid- 18 Id. at 2588. See Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, 412 U.S. 609 (1973).

Rec. 7786-89 (1938) (remarks of Rep. Phillips and Rep,. Lea). See also Durovic v.

The provisions of the bill are in no way intended to affect any existing authority of the De\u00ad partment of Health, Education, and Welfare to con\u00ad sider and evaluate the effectiveness of a new drug in the context of passing upon its safety.1'9 Language in the debates on the 1962 Drug Amendments reflects an understanding that the Act would apply to experimental drugs used to treat \"cancer in its last stages\" .20 Senator Eastland, proponent of the bill, also assumed that drugs administered for \"fatal diseases, such as cancer,\" would be subject to the Act's requirements, noting that approval of such drugs would be appropriate even though they might only prolong life or alleviate suffering. 21 In view of this Court's interpretation of the amend\u00ad ments to the Act as progressively strengthening and ex\u00ad tending that law's protection of the consumer,22 and the continuing evidence of concern by Congress with diseases that were considered \"fatal\", the protection afforded terminally ill patients under the Act has even greater force and effect today.

The court has usurped the role of the Congress by re\u00ad writing the Act.

Bacto-Unidisk, 394 U.S. 784, 798 (1969) : The historical expansion of the definition of drug, and the creation of a parallel concept of devices, clearly show, we think, that Congress fully intended that the Act's coverage be as broad as its literal language indicates-and equally clearly, broader than any strict medical definition might otherwise allow. Strong indications from legislative history that Congress intended the broad coverage the Dis\u00ad trict Court thought \"ridiculous\" should satisfy us that the lower courts erred in refusing to apply the Act's language as written. But we are all more con\u00ad vinced that we must give effect to congressional in\u00ad tent in view of the well-accepted principle that reme\u00ad dial legislation such as the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is to be given a liberal construction consistent with the Act's overriding purpose to protect the 23 [Continued] The term \"new drug\" means-(1) any drug ... the composi\u00ad tion of which is such that such drug is not generally recog\u00ad nized, among experts qualified by scientific training and ex\u00ad perience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as safe and effective for use and under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling thereof. 24 United States v.

The District And Appeal Court Decisions Conflict Markedly With the Decisions of Other Tribunals Presented With Patient Class Challenges To the Federal Drug Laws And Border on Pre-Emption The Court of Appeals' conclusion \"as a matter of law that the 'safety' and 'effectiveness' terms used in the statute have no reasonable appli~ation to terminally ill cancer patients, and have no established meaning when considered in that context\" 26 is in conflict with Ruther\u00ad ford v. American Medical Association, 879 F.2d 641 (7th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1048 21 and also with Tutoki v. Celebrezze, 875 F.2d 105 (7th Cir. 1967) .28 The Allen Rutherford case involved an action for a permanent injunction against the FDA and others by a physician and a number of cancer patients requiring that agency and others to cease their interference with the distribution, for their use, of the alleged cancer drug krebiozen. Krebiozen had not received new drug ap\u00ad proval from the FDA and hence was unavailable in inter\u00ad state commerce. The Court of Appeals \"sympathetically viewed\" the action as \"an outcry of hopeless, suffering cancer victims.\" 879 F.2d. at 642. However, the Court 26 Petitioners. Appendix at 3a. 27 Hereinafter referred to as the \"Allen Ruthe.rford\" case to distinguish it from the Glen Rutherford case which is the subject of this proceeding. 28 Hereinafter referred to as \"Tutoki\". 20 did not reach the conclusion that the Act does not apply to such \"hopeless\" cancer victims. It rather, in denying their claim for injunctive relief, held that the right to such relief requires a showing under the Act that under the procedures established by Congress for the introduc\u00ad tion of new drugs, the drug Krebiozen would be approved or exempted (grandfather clause application) by the FDA. In the Tutoki case, the court of appeals was asked to issue a declaratory judgment that the approval and exemption provisions of the federal laws relating to food and drugs do not apply to cancer patients and the drug they sought,-Krebiozen. 375 F.2d at 106. The Tutoki Court, specifically faced with the issue whether the fed\u00ad eral drug laws were appropriately applied to cancer patients, mirrored the conclusions of the Allen Rutherford court,-that the FDA procedures cannot be bypassed UR.\u00ad less it can be shown that the FDA, if it acted upon Krebiozen, who would have approved or exempted the drug. The Allen Rutherford and Tutoki opinions thus postu\u00ad late the provisions of the drug laws as applying to \"hope\u00ad less\" cancer patients,-the exact opposite of the result urged by the Glen Rutherford Court of Appeals. A further ground for the reversal of the appeals court decision and adoption of. the Commissioners decision lies in the nature of pre-emption. The impermissible con\u00ad flict of the decisions of the district and the appeal courts with the federal drug laws. The legislative, administra\u00ad tive and court related history of the federal drug laws and amendments specifically articulate Congress' interest in protecting those with life-threatening illness or progres\u00ad sive (terminal) illness from drugs that are unsafe and ineffective. The Rutherford district court's certification of this case as a country encompassing class action, the legalization of laetrile in 19 states, the sham nature of the 21 affidavit system which permits those on the threshold of treatment easy access to a drug that has not satisfied recognized uniform standards of safety and efficacy all stand as obstacles to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objectives of Congress in the establishment of uniform standards for drug access. Cf. Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., -- U.S. --, 55 L.Ed2d 179 ( 1978). A substantial amount of legislative history exists as early as the original 1906 Act of which the passage quoted below is representative, indicating an in\u00ad tent on the part of Congress that the federal drug laws establish uniform standards. Senator McCumber, a co\u00ad sponsor of the Senate bill states: Another object is to prevent the evil of diverse rulings of the several commissioners of the States having pure-food laws ... We well know, Mr. President, that the moment we do pass a general law upon this subject, by vir\u00ad tue of that law covering ninety-odd percent of all of the commerce in impure products, that law must become the dominant law; and, if there is any dif\u00ad ference, the State laws will soon accommodate and modify themselves in conformity with the national legislation. 40 Congressional Record 1216 (1906) See e.g., 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 (new drug provisions) and compare with Section 202 of Public Law 87-781 which provides that the 1962 Amendments of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act invalidates any provision of state law that is in \"direct and positive conflict\" with the Act. It is well settled that a state is permitted to legislate or regulate with a view to the protection of its citizenry against fraud or imposition by impure or ineffective drugs. However, it is equally well settled that a: . . . state may not, under the guise of exercising its police power or otherwise, . . . enact legislation in 22 conflict with the statutes of Congress passed for the regulation of the subject, and if it does, to the ex\u00ad tent that the state law interferes with or frustrates the operation of the acts of Congress, its provisions must yield to the superior Federal power given to Congress by the Constitution. McDermott v. Wisconsin, 228 U.S. 115, 131-132 (1912) (citations omitted). The pre-emption rationale applies not only to states but also, to the orders of federal district courts. See rationale of Judge Chapman in his Order of November 30, 1976 in re Julian H. Morgan, Sr. et al. v. David Matthews, et al., Civil Action No. 76-1636, United States District Court of South Carolina, Spartanburg Division (appended hereto as Appendix A). The plaintiff cancer patients in the Morgan case, paralleling relief granted in some states by statute, sought to obtain civil, criminal and ethical immunity for physicians, nurses and technic\u00ad ians who would be administering laetrile. The plaintiff patients also sought a preliminary injunction restraining the federal officers from interfering with their procure\u00ad ment of a supply of Laetrile. In holding that the plain\u00ad tiff cancer patients had not met their burden of satisfying the four criteria essential to the relief sought, Judge Chapman held that: Finally, it has not been shown that the granting of injunctive relief in this case would not injure other parties or the public. To the contrary, to per\u00ad mit the distribution of Laetrile in this case would be to circumvent the laws enacted to assure that drugs distributed in interstate commerce be both safe and effective for their recommended use, and would undermine the ability of those charged with upholding these laws to do so most effectively in the future. Such a holding would also provide any fu\u00ad ture proponent of unproven remedies a basis for arguing to another court that it should allow the 23 distribution of substances in a manner contrary to the law. Appendix A at p. 6 (emphasis added). D. The Harm Perceived To The Allegedly Terminal Patient By Withholding An Exemption From The Federal Drug Laws For Laetrile Is De Minimus Measured Against The Substantial Harm To The Class Protected By The Act Particularly Those Whose Cancer Is Merely Life-Threatening Judge Chapman of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina in Julian H. Morgan, Sr. et al. v. Matthews, et al., Civil Action No. 76-1637, Order of November 30, 1976 (Appendix A hereto) denied a preliminary injunction sought by a person \"suffering from the advanced stages of cancer of the prostate\" to restrain federal officers from interfering with his pro\u00ad curement of Laetrile. He contrasted the lack of irrepar\u00ad able injury to the plaintiff cancer patient stemming from withholding access to laetrile with the injury to other parties and the public interest if the injunction were granted: It has not been shown that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not forthcoming. The only evidence presented to this Court of any benefit Laetrile might provide in the treatment of cancer is that in some instances indi\u00ad viduals taking it \"seem to experience diminishing pain and an increase in appetite, weight gain, and psychological improvement.\" Affidavit of Raymond Hilliard, M.D. This is consistent with the effect a placebo would produce. The record is devoid of any evidence that Laetrile cures or halts the progress of cancer. Thus, it does not follow that the enforce\u00ad ment of a law which denies Laetrile to a victim of cancer will cause him to suffer irreparable harm. * * * * This Court is not unmindful of the gravity of the situation facing those who are afflicted with cancer and of their desire to choose their own remedies in 24 view of the absence of any known cure for this disease. However, granting the relief requested in this case could not only harm the public by weaken\u00ad ing laws calculated to prevent the victimization of those afflicted with cancer and other conditions by playing on their desperation in the marketing of unproven and, possibly worthless remedies, but it could also further the growing tendency of those afflicted with this disease to engage in self treat\u00ad ment resulting in a delay in seeking early diagnosis and prompt treatment with forms of therapy that have no established value. The result of this type of delay could be disastrous, since early diagnosis and treatment is of the utmost importance in the management of cancer. (Appendix A at pp. 5-7) (footnotes omitted). Judge Chapman's concern that approval of laetrile for the terminally ill poses a substantial threat to those whose cancer is in a treatable stage is noted by Dr. Lewis Thomas at the Hearings held by Senator Kennedy on the Laetrile issue in July of 1977.2Q It is often asserted that since Laetrile is not a particularly toxic substance, it should be made avail\u00ad able to all patients who wish to use it as a matter of free choice. There is, however, a very real danger here. If, for example, children with early leukemia or sarcoma, or women with cancer of the breast, or young men with Hodgkin's disease, are persuaded to give Laetrile a trial before doing anything else, the outcome will almost certainly be death, in cir- 29 Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Committee on Human Resources, \"Evalua\u00ad tion of Information on which the FDA Based its Decision to Ban The Drug Laetrile From Interstate Commerce\", 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 14 (1977). 25 cumstances where appropriate therapy could be life\u00ad saving.\"w Similar objections to an exemption for the terminally ill were raised by David T. Carr, M.D. and made a part of the record in the Laetrile Rulemaking proceedings. Dr. Carr expresses his opinion concerning the medical and scientific basis for, and the public health conse\u00ad quences of the availability of amygdalin, or other similar unproven cancer remedies, for clinical use in patients with \"terminal\" cancer: My opinion is that this would be unwise. The ex\u00ad pression \"terminal cancer\" is a poor one. A patient may be critically ill due to the effects of a cancer and improve at least temporarily or even perma\u00ad nently following appropriate therapy. Administra\u00ad tion of an ineffective drug such as amygdalin in\u00ad stead of such appropriate therapy would deprive a significant number of patients of their chance for some relief, temporary though it might be in many cases. It is true that many patients come to a point in time when only supportive care is possible. It has been argued that administration of amygdalin to these patients would do no harm. No one knows whether or not the drug would do no harm. There 30 Some examples. of resort to laetrile by patients before resort to conventional therapy are in \"Healing : A Doctor In Search of a Miracle\", William A. Nolen, M.D. (Random House) ; Ad.R. 197, Donald C.S. Tan M.D. and the Report of the Alameda County Coroner on his investigation of a death by cyanide intoxication of a patient on laetrile therapy, Appendix B hereto at pp. 69-71. The importance of early detection and treatment in terms of survival when cancer is localized as opposed to delay in treatment until the cancer has spread is set forth in the American Cancer Society's 1979 Cancer Facts and Figures at page 9. The chart shows the following five year survival rates for localized as compared to disseminated cancer: bladder 72/14; breast and uterus-corpus 86/33. 26 is no reason to believe that it would do any good. And if it were made generally available for that group of patients it would inevitably be given to or obtained by others for whom effective therapy is available. Once the decision is made to permit the distribution of one useless drug for such cases there will certainly be more proponents demanding that the same loophole in the law be open to their un\u00ad proven remedy.131 Further, approval of laetrile for the terminally ill would give the appearance of an official imprimatur, and would encourage use of the drug by patients who could be helped by legitimate therapy. See the Commissioner's Opinion at Petitioner's Appendix p. 268a. James Harvey Young, a noted medical historian, testified on the basis of his study of past unproven cures that \"[p] ermitting laetrile's use in terminal cases gives it a credence among the public at large that will expand its use in early cases, for people will prefer taking a 'vitamin' to con\u00ad fronting the Dr. Samuel G. Klagsbrun, a psychiatrist who works with cancer patients at St. Luke's Hospital in New York, testified that \"[p]ermitting laetrile to be used by any population of cancer victims would have the correlative effect of creating the misimpression in the minds of other cancer victims that the drug is, in fact, safe and effective for a broader population.\" Petitioners' Appendix at 269a. 31 To the same effect see1 Ad.R. 191 at H6, the affidavit of Philip Schein, M.D.: \"If Laetrile is permitted in general clinical use without its ef\u00ad feetiveness having first been demonstrated by substantial evi\u00ad dence, it will open a Pandora's box which will plague both the medical profession and the public for many years to come. The preeedent would allow many other ineffeetive drugs to be used under the guise of effective placebo therapy or psychological sup\u00ad port-in conditions for which there are not data to support their effeetiveness.\" 27 The record of this proceeding makes highly visible the practical impossibility of restricting the importation of latetrile to the terminally ill. The obstacles to such restriction were attested to by an officer of the Drug Enforcement Administration one Kenneth Durrin, Act\u00ad ing Director of the Office of Compliance of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Mr. Durrin related the agency's experience in regulatory other controlled sub\u00ad stances available for limited use, e.g., cocaine and then applied that experience to the Laetrile problem. He tes\u00adtified that since Laetrile does not appear to have a cen\u00ad tral nervous system effect, it would not come under the controlled substances act and the controls available under the Act. \"Absent the kinds of controls available under the Controlled Substances Act-and indeed even with such controls-it is my opinion that a drug such as Lae\u00ad trile could not effectively be restricted to a class of ter\u00ad minally ill cancer patients. For example, absent a quota on production, manufacturers would not be limited to producing an amount of Laetrile sufficient only to pro\u00ad vide a source of supply for terminal cancer patients. Manufacturers would not be restricted in the channels in which they could permissably distribute the drug. They would not be required to report transactions in Laetrile.\" Ad.R. 435 at 7293. The inability to restrict usage also flows from the practical impossibility of arriving at an objective stand\u00ad ard that will not lend itself to abuse. See discussion at pp. 7-10, supra. Both the potential for and actuality of abuse is appar\u00ad ent from the record before the court of appeals. Food and Drug Administration investigators telephoned pa\u00ad tients who had executed patient importation affidavits in the district court proceeding. A common pattern emerged. The need of patients whose six month laetrile requirements were 26 ampoules and 180-185 tablets were 28 stated by affidavit without their permiss1on to be 150 ampoules and 750 tablets. The excess is apparently used by the \"importer\" to supply patients who had not exe\u00ad cuted affidavits. See Ct.R. 409-414, 423-480 and see Ct.R. 1505 and attachments. This type of abuse resulted in a complaint for forfeiture before the district court in Maryland 132 to seize from a pharmacist acting as agent for patients holding laetrile import affidavits the laetrile pro.cured by him which exceeding their actual orders: 4. As agent for the persons named in the affidavits, Mr. Henderson was authorized to deliver to these persons the amounts of Laetrile imported on their behalf and for their personal use. 5. Investigations by United States Food and Drug Administration investigators have revealed that the affidavits are fraudulent in that patients on whose behalf affidavits were presented to customs officials either ordered significantly less than the amount of Laetrile declared on the affidavits or did not order any Laetrile whatsoever and are unaware of any affidavit being executed on their behalf. 6. Food and Drug Administration investigations further reveal that Mr. Henderson has solicited abandonment of Laetrile from patients who ordered Laetrile and on whose behalf affidavits were pre\u00ad sented to customs officials and that either as a re\u00ad sult of such solicitations or for other reasons, some patients have cancelled or reduced their orders for Laetrile. . 7. Food and Drug Administration investigations further reveal that affidavits presented to customs officials contain false information in that the amounts 32 United States v. Articles of Drug ... Amigdalina Cyto Pharma De Mexico, S.A., Docket No. K77-1283 filed on August 4, 1977. The complaint and Motion for Patient Release on Seized Goods and Supervised Delivery to Certain Patients are appended hereto as Appendix D. 29 of Laetrile represented to have been ordered by the patients exceeds the amounts actually ordered and that Mr. Henderson uses these amounts of Laetrile not ordered by patients to create a stockpile from which he then sells to other persons who have not executed affidavits presented to Customs for pur\u00ad poses of facilitating importation of the drug for their use. A final example of abuse arises in a case involving a minor treated with chemotherapy under court order whose parents were also administering laetrile and other therapies to him without court permission. During a hearing on whether the child was harmed by the addi\u00ad tion of laetrile, massive doses of vitamin A and enzyme enemas, a doctor testifying for the parents stated that he did not believe that the minor was terminally ill but that he would execute an affidavit such as that required by the district court in the case before this Court stating that the minor was terminal in order to permit the child to procure a supply of laetrile.:as The dangers posed by approval of laetrile for the terminally ill are particularly clear in the case of chil\u00ad dren with cancer. Children constitute only one percent of the cancer cases in this country but cancer represents the most serious threat to childlife next to accidents. Childhood cancers are also the category in which the greatest success in long-term remission and \"cures\" have been made. Yet, the natural desire for parents to avoid the suffering for their child which is a part of conven- 38 In Custody of a Minor (Appendix C), Dr. Ernesto Contreras testified that the minor does not have terminal cancer. He also testi\u00ad fied that despite the fact that the minor does riot have terminal \u00b7 cancer, he would be willing to sign a \"Bohanon affidavit\" attesting that Chad does have terminal cancer. On the following day, Dr. Bruce Halstead of California\u00b7 made the same statement. The record in this case is sealed until an appeal is taken. The information in text was received from a physician-witness for the State of Massachusetts. 30 tional treatment makes this class a minority which re\u00ad quires protection from the loophole in the law advanced in the Rutherford court appeal. This need is illustrated by a recent Massachusetts case arising from a physicians request to have a child com\u00ad mitted to the Department of Public Welfare for the purpose of providing necessary medical care ( chemo\u00ad therapy) for the treatment of leukemia. Custody of a Minor, S.J.C. No. P-1422, Mass. Supreme Court, Plym\u00ad outh Division of April 18, 1978 in Civil Action No. 78-6916. Indeed, given the nebulous benefits which can be an\u00ad ticipated by the truly terminal patient from access to laetrile, the court of appeals exemption deprives that class of patient of very real and needed protections stemming from the nature of end-stage disease which are secured to this class by the federal drug laws. The court of appeals asked the question: [W] hat can \"generally recognized\" as \"safe and effective mean to such persons who are so fatally stricken with a disease for which there is no known cure? o34 What meaning can \"effective have in the absence of anything which may be used as a stand\u00ad ard. Under this record Laetrile is as effective as anything else. What can \"effective mean if the person, by all prevailing standards, and under the 34 This finding flies in the fact of administrative and court in\u00ad terpretation which has hitherto consistently found the Act and its safety and effectiveness provisions applicable to cancer patients. See e.g., Hearings on S. 1552 Before the Subcomm. on Antitrust and Monopoly of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary 87th Cong., 1st Sess. Part 5, at 2588 at which the Secretary of HEW explained the FD A's attitude as follows: \"If the drug is offered for the treat\u00ad ment of progressive or life threatening diseases such as cancer, or if the drug is seriously toxic or has alarming side effects we now consider its effectiveness.\" (emphasis added). See also, Duro\u00ad vic v. Richardson, 479 F.2d 242 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 944, and the decision at pp. 15-18, supra. 31 position of the Commission takes, is going to die of cancer regardless of what may be done. ( Peti\u00ad tioner Appendix at 6a) .85 The Court of Appeal's focus is apparently restricted to \"cure\" and is thus too narrow in terms of the class it addresses,-the terminally ill. Bernard C. Meyer in an article \"Truth and the Physician\" reprinted in Ethi\u00ad cal Issues in Death and Dying (1977) at 533, observes that the \"Physician's response once he can no longer arrest disease is to assuage discomfort and distress\". A cure may not be possible, but other relief for the termi\u00ad nally ill may be, for example, pain control, appetite stimulation, tranquilization. In the Laetrile Hearings it became clear that the pur\u00ad veyors of laetrile have moderated their claims for the substance in recent years. For the most part, it is no longer openly claimed 00 that laetrile cures cancer [al\u00ad though this is the expectation of the cancer victims that turn to it] .\"iB7 The current thrust of the laetrile 35 There is inconsistency in the Court of Appeals finding that the terminally ill are excluded for the strictures of the Act while at the same time confining the utilization of laetrile to an injection route. 36 Compare the remarks of Lewis Thomas, M.D., Director of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at Laetrile Hearings pp. 13-14 (\"It is no longer openly claimed that Laetrile cures cancer\", although some of the leaflets and public releases hing broadly in this direction.\") with the remarks of Senator Kennedy at p. 257: \" ... the thing that's interesting about your careful choice of words about the impact of this [Laetrile] would be you had no reluctance of using the word 'cures' or 'recoveries' in the transcripts here be\u00ad fore the California case. It was a tape of the town meeting. And I'll just read: 'Some cases have undergone clinical arrests, or for other practical purposes, we might describe as cures or recoveries.' \" 37 See Record Volume XIV, Transcript on Plaintiffs Motion For Temporary Injunctive, July, 1975, ... have been denied what many, many physicians and high level biochem\u00ad ists feel is a complete cancer remedy. Nothing is complete, but I 32 proponents seems to be that it will dramatically relieve pain, improve appetite, promote weight gain, reduce the odor associated with cancer, improve the cancer patients general sense of well-being, control or prevent cancer.38 The terminally ill are entitled under the Act to the assurance that the products they seek to use are effective not only for cure or treatment but also for these other purposes. Cancer victims constitute a minority group in our so\u00ad ciety; terminal cancer patients constitute an even smaller minority, but like other groups, they have a right not to be exploited. In the case of cancer drugs, particularly the exercise of government power of protection, premar\u00ad ket clearance is not only reasonable, but necessary to protect the compelling public interest in effective cancer therapy, and in assuring that non-therapeutic drugs do what they say. In view of the widespread incidence of cancer, the serious consequences of the disease, the expe- mean a very effective remedy); 30 (\"I am alive because of it\"). 86 (\"I hope and pray that we will get his protective order to keep him alive.\") 38 See e.g., Laetrile Hearings at pp. 13-14 (Dr. Thomas). 246- 247, 271-72 (prevention, control, pain relief, appetite increase, weight gain, feeling of well-being), J.A. Richardson, M.D. physi\u00ad cian using laetrile, 295-297 (stimulation of appetite, weight gain, decrease or eliminate pain, bad odor, pallor, remarks of Robert Bradford, Committee on Free Choice for Cancer Treatment. Mr. Bradford also stated at p. 295 that \"Laetrile is not offered as a cancer cure. There is no cure for cancer . . . In the very best of instances it may effect a control-but not a cure-of cancer .... \"). See also the opinion of the Commissioner of the FDA at Petitioners Appendix pp. 73a-78a. Compare the Alameda County Coroner's Report, Appendix B hereto at 17a in which a patient with advanced carcinoma of the breast who was on laetrile treatments. The medical report fur\u00ad nished to the Coroner from the laetrile clinic at which she was treat\u00ad ed since March of 1978 refeqed to her complaints of \"loss o.f sleep associated with severe pain.\" She died of cyanide intoxication in December of 1978. 33 rience with the particular vulnerability of cancer pa\u00ad tients and their families to promoters of easy money\u00ad making schemes labeled in mysterious scientific dress, it is imperative that the standards of consumer protection set forth in the federal drug acts be maintained. Further, the Court of Appeals assumes that Laetrile by injection is safe.l.'n) This assumption is unsupported by the record before this Court. An awareness of the actual and potential toxicity of Laetrile has emerged in recent expressions of scientific opinion.\"' 0 Of particular significance is the article \"Laetrile Toxicity: A Report of Two Cases\", Smith and Schein, 238 Journal of the American Medical Ass'n 1361 (Sept. 1977). This article describes a case of serious side effects relating to admin\u00adistration of laetrile by injection and the cessation of such side effects when the laetrile was withdrawn. 39 The Court of Appeals direction to the FDA to promulgate regulations relating to the use of laetrile by injection by the ter\u00ad minally ill, cannot be executed. The laetrile proponents have been unable to provide a consistent picture of what the components of laetrile are. The samples alleged to be laetrile seized and analyzed by the FDA have had differing chemical compositions. Specifically, Commissioner Kennedy testified at pp. 4-5 of the Laetrile Hearings that the substance \"has no fixed identity in the hands of our ana\u00ad lytical chemists who find that the amount of amygdalin and the ratio of its isometric forms varies widely in the samples of mate~ rials we had seized.\" See also the Commissioners Opinion at Petitioners Appendix pp. 182a-187a. Compare, Durovic v. Richardson, 479 F.2d 242, 251 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 944. In that case, the Court of Ap\u00ad peals, as one rationale for its decision that Krebiozen could not be generally recognized as safe even in the narrow sense of non-toxic by qualified experts found that as of \"October 9, 1962, the identity and composition of Krebiozen was completely unknown.\" 4<l See e.g., Jukes \"Laetrile for 236 Journal Ameri\u00ad Rambert, \"Fatal Cyanide Poison\u00ad ing: Accidental Ingestion of Amygdalin,\" 238 Journal of the Ameri\u00ad can Medical Ass'n 482 (1977) and Lewis, \"Laetrile\" 127 Western Journal of Medicine 55 (1977); and the toxicity issue is discussed at pp. 59-71, infra. 34 II. APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE BURDEN OF PROOF AND REVIEW CRITERIA DEMON\u00ad STRATES THE DISTRICT COURT'S ERROR IN FINDING AN EXEMPTION FOR LAETRILE UNDER THE 1962 GRANDFATHER CLAUSE FROM THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL DRUG LAWS AND< SUPPORTS THE COMMISSIONER'S FINDING THAT NO EX\u00ad EMPTION IS WARRANTED A. Standards of Proof and Review Criteria No matter how a drug becomes the subject of an FDA rulemaking proceeding-agency initiative, manufacturer or other drug proponent initiative, court referral-the burdens of proof and proceeding and the standards of review established by the federal drug laws as construed by the courts are the same. The statute and regulations do not require the Food and Drug Administration to prove a drug ineffective but rather, the burden of pro\u00adceeding and proof of safety/efficacy by a substantial amount of well documented evidence lies with the pro\u00ad ponents of the drug.' 41 The court of appeals and the dis\u00ad trict court below, from the outset, have eschewed the statutory standard and have created a hybrid standard. The standard literally requires the FDA to initiate an administrative proceeding on drug status and bear the burden of proof in that proceeding whenever, in the absence of an administrative record or new drug appli\u00ad cation, the FDA proceeds with the presumption of \"new drug\" status. As stated by the Court of Appeals : We are unable, however, to see how the FDA can escape the obligation of producing an administrative record to support its determination of the first and 41 See e.g. Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott and Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. 609, 617 (1973); Ubiotica Corp. v. FDA, 427 F.2d 376, 378 (6th Cir. 1970) ; Upjohn Co. v. Finch, 422 F.2d 944, 955 (6th Cir. 1970); North American Pharmacal, Inc. v. HEW, 491 F.2d 546, 550-51 (8th Cir. 1973). 35 more fundamental issue that Laetrile is a new drug, for it is not a new drug merely because they say it is. . . To support its determination the FDA in the case at bar would have to present substantial evi\u00ad dence to support the proposition that Laetrile is not generally recognized among qualified experts as \"safe and effective,\" and that Laetrile is not grandfathered by either of the exemptions discussed above.42 The FDA is not required by any provision in the fed\u00ad eral drug laws or any principle of administrative law to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to determine the \"new drug\" or \"grandfather\" status of a product before the agency can declare that product to be a \"new drug.\" 42 Federal Register 10067 (1977). For example, the predicate of each enforcement action which the agency brings to prevent and punish violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(d) and 355(a) is the \"new drug\" status of the product involved. The decision made to initiate enforce\u00adment proceedings is technically based on probable cause that a drug is in violation of the Act.'-1 3 The absence of an \"approval\" or \"exemption\" in its records that the FDA can point to requires a \"new drug\" description until the proponents of the drug have proven differently. A reversal of burdens of proof and proceeding when an affected patient requests relief conflicts with the deci\u00ad sions in other courts. For example, District Court Judge Chapman in Julian H. Morgan Sr., et al. v. David Matthews, et al.,,44 denied the same relief request by the patient plaintiffs in Rutherford with the fallowing ra\u00ad tionale: Plaintiffs apparently contend that the burden is on the FDA to approve or disapprove of a new 42 542 F.2d at 1143 and Petitioners Appendix at v. Mytinger & Inc., 339 U.S. 594 (1950). 44 Appendix A hereto. 36 drug in the first instance, since they complain that the FDA \"has failed, without adequate explanation, to approve Laetrile for distribution and use in the United States ... \"The language and history of the Act demonstrate that it is not the responsibility of the FDA to initiate applications on its own in the absence of an application that conforms with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 505 (a) and (b). No such application has been filed here. See Finding of Fact 2, supra. The FDA has been given the responsibility of \"approving applications\". Therefore, it is apparent that they must be submitted for approval. This con\u00ad clusion conforms with the Act's legislative history. The House Committee Report discussion \u00a7 505 dur- ing its initial drafting in 1938 stated that This provision will not put the Federal Govern\u00ad ment into the business of developing new drugs, nor will it require the Governement to duplicate laboratory and clinical tests made by respons\u00ad ible manufacturers. The provision merely sets up a method for the authoritative review of the manufacturer's tests and will not unreasonably delay the introduction of new drugs in the mar\u00ad ket. H.R. Rep. No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess. (April 14, 1938), p.9. Further discussion was held as to this section in the House Report of 1962 amended version, which indicates that application was to be made by the manufacturer: Section 505 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act prohibits interstate shipment of a \"new drug\" . . . unless it is first cleared for safety through the filing of a new drug application by the man\u00adufacturer. 37 H.R. Rep. No. 2464, 87th Cong., 2d Judge Kiley, in Tutoki v. Celebrezze, 375 F.2d 105 (7th Cir. 1967) denying declaratory relief against the FDA to cancer patients seeking Krebiozen because of their failure to exhaust administrative remedies, ex\u00ad pressly found that the statute did not preclude cancer patients from sponsoring an NDA for Krebiozen. Finally, Judge Hastings speaking for a unanimous court in Rutherford v. American Medical Ass'n et al., 379 F.2d 641 (7th Cir. 1967), found as one basis for his decision that the FDA need not cease its interference with patient/physician procurement of Krebiozen, that the Krebiozen proponents had not shown that they had made a good faith attempt to comply with the procedures es\u00ad tablished by Congress for the introduction of new drugs. The court reasoned as follows: In their complaint, plaintiffs have alleged, in ef\u00ad fect, that the FDA has systematically attempted to discredit Krebiozen and to prevent its introduction into commerce. It is argued that on a motion to dismiss, we must accept the truth of these allega\u00ad tions. Accepting their truth arguendo, plaintiffs still have not shown that they have in good faith attempted to comply with the procedures established by Congress for the introduction of new drugs, nor has it been shown that the failure to apply can be attributed solely to the activities of the FDA and the defendants. The fact that compliance might be expensive and burdensome, is not unfairness in the procedure, but a consequence of a reasonable Congressional scheme for the introduction of new drugs. Without an attempted good faith application for ap\u00ad proval or exemption, we have no jurisdiction to de- 45 Id. at page 5. 38 termine whether the FDA has illegally placed impossible or unreasonable conditions on approval or exemption, or has made requests for information impossible to fulfill, or whether the FDA has been dilatory, biased, or discriminatory. Until someone has attempted to comply with the Act with respect to Krebiozen, plaintiffs' appeal should be to the sponsors of the drug. 46 Thus in parallel cases, courts have held that the shift of proponent position from manufacturer/developer to patient permitted no dilution of the standards and pro\u00ad cedures for determination of the status of the drug. Deviation from the prescribed statutory standard of proof is also inconsistent with the relative positions of the parties in this proceeding. The \"evidence\" which the FDA is supposed to provide lies within the control of those physicians and manufacturers who are said to be using and making Laetrile. This is not an enforcement proceeding in which the Government by seizure/subpoena or other process can \"require\" the production of evidence. The record in the Laetrile Rulemaking proceeding is clear that the proponent manufacturer,/developers of the drug have not made a good faith attempt to comply with the NDA or IND procedures. They submitted applications in 1962 and 1970 but when notified of deficiencies did not come forward with submissions conforming with statu\u00ad tory and regulatory criteria to correct those deficiencies. No attempt was made by the proponent manufacturers/ developers in the rulemaking proceeding to utilize this opportunity to come forward with the quantity and quality of proof to support approval of a \"new drug.\" One conclusion that may be drawn from this factual scenario is that the manufacturer/ developers of Laetrile 46 379 F .2d at 643. 89 are utilizing the cancer patient as a pawn to effect an end run around the provisions of the provisions of the federal drug laws. The statute and case law both sustain the proposi\u00ad tion that the burden of proceeding and providing evidence that will sustain the substantial evidence tests imposed by the federal drug laws for the admission of a \"new drug\" to interstate commerce, lies with the Laetrile pro\u00ad ponents. The only issue involved in the decisions below which concerns the presence or absence of such substantial evidence 47 is the district court's finding that the 1962 grandfather clause is applicable. This presents an alter\u00ad native ground for or reversal or affi.rmance of the court of appeals decision by this Court.48 Entitlement to the grandfather exemption of the 1962 amendments, i.e. Section 107(c) (4) of the Food and Drug Act,49 is limited to drugs which: 1. feature today the identical chemical composition recommended dosages, and claims made in label\u00ad ing as existed on October 9, 1962, and 2. were used or sold commercially in the United States on October 9, 1962, and 3. were generally recognized by the experts as safe; and 47 See Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, 412 U.S. 609, 632 (1973). 48 The district court apparently concedes Laetrile's status as \"drug\" (Petitioners Appendix at 18a) and its inability to meet the \"efficacy\" standards of the Act (Pet. App. at 22a), thus the \"ex\u00ad emption\" of laetrile from new drug status by application of the 1962 grandfather clause (Pet. App. 25a) is the alternative grounds for affi.rmance which involves the scrutiny of the record and alloca\u00ad tion of burden of proof. 49 Pub. L. 87-781, found as a note to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321. Section 107 (c) ( 4) is quoted in full in the statutory appendix hereto. 40 4. were not covered by an effective drug applica\u00ad tion.50 The grandfather clause exception to the federal drug laws is construed strictly against those invoking it.51 The failure of a drug to meet just one of these criteria extinguishes altogether its entitlement to grandfather status. The record in this proceeding clearly demonstrates that laetrile fails to meet each and every one of the four criteria. The remanding opinions and orders recognized the \"pri\u00ad mary jurisdiction\" of the FDA to determine the \"status\" of a drug and directed that the determination be made via a rulemaking proceeding.52 The FDA acted. The resulting Commissioner's decision is subject to the stand\u00ad ards of the court scrutiny applicable to review of agency action. The review court is required to view the record as a whole 53 and determine whether the Commissioner has articulated the grounds of his decision, whether those grounds are consistent with the statute, and whether 50 United St.ates v. Allan Drug Corp., 357 F.2d 713, 718-19 (10th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 899; United St.ates v. 1,048,000 Capsules, More or Less, 347 F. Supp. 768 (S.D. Tex. 1972); see also Rutherford v. United States, 542 F.2d 1137, 1141 (10th Cir. 1976). The Commissioner concedes issue No. 4 in the Notice of Rule\u00ad making and it need not be addressed here. 51 See e.g., United States v. Allan Drug Corp., 357 F.2d 713, 718 (10th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 899 (1966). Accord Durovic v. Richardson, 479 F.2d 242, 250 n.6 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 944; United St.ates v. denied, 421 U.S. 938 (1973); United St.ates v. 1,048,000 Capsules, More or Less, et al., 347 F. Supp. 768, 770 (S.D. F.2d at 1143-1144 and Pet. App. at12a. 53 See the Administrative Procedure Act 5 U.S.C. Section 706, and see Diamond King Ranch, Inc. v. Morton, 531 F.2d 1397, 1405 (10th Cir. 1976). 41 those grounds are supported by the evidence of record. In short, if the Commissioners decision shows that the FDA has a reasonable basis for concluding that the drug proponents submissions did not comply with the substantial evidence requirements of the statute and regu\u00ad lations; the Commissioner's decision should be affirmed. 54 As the 10th Circuit itself has indicated: Review under this provision of the A.P.A. provokes injury whether the administrative decisions were based on a consideration of all the relevant factors and whether there was a clear error of judgment.

Although this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and care\u00adful, the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one. The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Id. The court's function is exhausted where a rational basis is found for the agency action taken. Udall v.

Application of the proper standard of proof and review criteria supports the conclusion reached by the Commis\u00ad sioner, detailed below, that the drug Laetrile does not satisfy any of the elements of the 1962 grandfather clause. 54 Sabin v. Butz, 515 F.2d 1061, 1067 (10th Cir. 1975). 42 B. Laetrile Is Not Entitled To Grandfather Status Because Its Chemical Composition And Recom\u00ad mended Conditions For Use And Administration Are Not The Sarne Today As They Were On October 9, 1961 55 1. The Relationship Between Laetrile and Amyg\u00ad dalin Laetrile is the term used to describe a class of cyano\u00ad genic glucosides of which the substance amygdalin is the primary ingredient. 56 The terms amygdalin and Laetrile are often used interchangeably. This stems from the fact that amygdalin is the one ingredient which in varying percentages has been consistently present in the \"laetriles.\" However, this interchangeable use is incor\u00ad rect. 57 Laetrile and amygdalin differ in formulae and 65 The variations in composition and conditions of usage for the drug Laetrile are set forth graphically in the time line flow chart at pp. 65-68 of this brief. The chart by years from 1920's through 1978 represents the claims made by Laetrile's mechanism (ra\u00ad tional) of drug action, label/pamphlet claims, formulation, method of preparation (reconstitution), dosage, route (method of) ad\u00ad ministration, use as an investigational drug which is inconsistent with claims of commercial marketing and the representations as to safety and toxicity made Laetrile labels and pamphlets. w See Dorr, Paxinos \"The Current Status of Laetrile,\" 89 Annals of Internal Medicine 389 (1978) (hereinafter \"Annals\").

See Pet. App. at 58a-70a.59 2. The Record On The Chemical Composition And Conditions Of Use For Laetrile The record in the rulemaking proceeding fully sup\u00ad ports the Commissioners determination that Laetrile is not a compound which has enjoyed any continuity of composition or recommended conditions of use and ad\u00ad ministration. See Pet. App. at 58a-78a, 182a-204a. By way of contrast, the district court ( Pet. App. at 25a- 34a) exempts Laetrile by application of the 1962 grand\u00ad father clause, but does not address any of the issues in- that Laetrile and amygdalin are, in fact identical substances). Ct.R. 1507 \"Amygdalin (Laetrile) Therapy, 1977, Bruce Halstead, M.D. This booklet was plaintiffs exhibit before the district court. At page 3 of the booklet, Dr. Halstead, a laetrile advocate, states: \"The terms frequently inter\u00ad changeably by laymen, but are not chemically synonymous.\" 58 See Annals at 390; Fenselau \"Mandelonitrile B-Glucuronide: Synthesis And Characterization, 198 Science (1977); Pet.

App. at p. 26a-34a) that if Laetrile and amygdalin are interchangeable, amygdalin availability as a chemical from drug supply houses satisfies the commercial marketing requirements of the 1962 grandfather clause. The fallacy of this argument is discussed in text at pp. 54-56, infra. 44 herent in the labeling/conditions of use arm of the grand\u00ad father provision: Drug formulation, consistency, dosage, route of administration, theory of action and claims for the product now and prior to October 9, 1962.60 With one exception,61 the only reference to chemical formula made by the district court relates to amygdalin ( Pet. App. at 34a n.24) not laetrile. on interchange\u00ad able 42-43, supra.'62 Table A at pp. 65-68, infra, demonstrates the lack of consistency and predictability as to method of action, chemical formula, dosage, route of administration, claims for use as well as safety and toxicity and the absence of commercial marketing data in the record. This is the 60 Since all grandfather criteria must be met before an exemp\u00ad tion is applicable, this deficiency alone nullifies the district court's finding of an exemption. See note 51 supra, and United States v. Bentex Ulcerine, 469 F.2d at 878. 61 The district court's sole reference to Laetrile's formula is at note 17 at Pet. App. 26a. The district court attempts. to explain away the obvious differences between a specific laetrile and amyg\u00ad dalin formula by referring to R.183 at which Mr. Krebs stated that he had abandoned that specific synthesis of laetrile because it was too expensive to formulate. The district court makes no attempt to explain the many other differences in laetrile versus amygdalin formulae. See e.g. 2 at p. 143 (Laetrile= 1-mandelonitrile-beta-glucoroniside); and see the discussion in text and notes at pp. 42-43, supra. The articles in Science and the Annals of Internal Medicine diagram laetrile/ amygdalin and show the differences in chemical formula. fill The district court attempts to dilute the effectiveness of the grandfaster clause by construing it as exempting any drug \"to the extent that it is currently being used for the same purposes and under the same conditions and labeling as on October 9, 1962.\" (Pet. App. at pp. 15a-16a, note 7). This construction flies in the face of United States v. Allan Drug Corp., 357 F.2d 713, 718 (10th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 899. In that case, the court held that a drug relabeled by court order after 1962 to eliminate false claims was not entitled to a grandfather clause exemption. The Allan court \"confine(d) the exemption to drugs intended solely for use under the conditions prescribed on the effective date of the Act\" 357 F.2d at 719. 45 bedrock underlying the Comissioners decision that the ele\u00ad ments of a grandfather exemption have not been supported by substantial evidence. The Table als<:> demonstrates the error of the district court. By way of illustration, some of the inconsistencies in chemical composition and usage of the drug set forth in the Table are discussed below. Laetrile traces its genesis to the work of Dr. E. T. Krebs, Sr. with amygdalin in the 1920's, 613 but its evolu\u00ad tion since that time has changed its chemical composition materially. Dr. Krebs himself admits that the name was not coined until 1949, and that the name has been used since that time for the final form of the amygdalin pro\u00adduced by Krebs, regardless of its actual chemical com\u00ad position.64 The degree of change in the composition of Krebs' amygdalin, or laetrile, over the years and the precise dates on which changes were effected, are difficult to pinpoint due to the general lack of knowledge and information on the product. Almost without exception, the specific evidence con\u00ad tained in the record as to labels, clinical formulae, pamph\u00ad lets relating to usage and the like do not come from the proponents of the drug who present conclusions without supporting data. Specific evidence comes from those testifying against the safety/efficacy/general recognition of laetrile who cite specific materials distributed by the laetrile proponents in support of their claims. 65 63 Ad.R. 184 (Affidavit of Carl M. Leventhal, M.D.) Exh. 6. 64 Id. -05 Ad.R. 434 (Affidavit o.f Carl M. Leventhal, M.D.) at M 280. \"The testimony by laetrile proponents on use prior to October 10, 1962 do not provide information on the composition of the drug, form, strength, purity, recommended conditions of use, route and method of administration, dosage schedule.\" 46 Just as the chemical composition of laetrile has been in a state of evolution over the years, so too has its labeling with respect to the dosage to be administered and the purpose of the drug. For example, the shipment of laetrile to Dr. Cooper in 1952, which clearly was for investigational purposes, 66 was accompanied by a letter which addressed dosage as follows : In these early days it is difficult to be too spe\u00ad cific about a good many things, but the consensus of opinion at the moment is that the following dos\u00ad age schedule is best: For the rapid or high-grade malignancies 50mg. every other day; For the slow or low-grade malignancies 50 to 100 mg. every five or seven days; For the usual or intermediate case 50 mg. every three to fl ve days. 67 [Emphasis added.] In fact, in the early 1950's uncertainty about the use of laetrile was such that in some respects Spicer-Gerhart, a manufacturer of laetrile, refrained from advising the method of use: The injection usually is given intramuscularly although when it is possible to give it directly into the malignant lesion, this may be done with advantage. How ever, perhaps one had better leave directions of that sort for a little later, after you have had some personal experience with the substance.68 On one point, Spicer-Gerhart was quite firm: laetrile was not to be taken orally. According to a mimeograph prepared by the Company for guidance to doctors on the 66 Ad.R. 388, Exh. 2, 3 (Affidavit of John R. Cooper, M.D.). e1 Jd. 68 Id., Exh. 4 ( emphasis added). 47 use of laetrile, the substance was described as \"extremely toxic by [oral] route of administration.\" 611 In 1952 Spicer-Gerhart described the theory behind laetrile as follows: In order that there shall be no misunderstanding, may I remind you that, according to the theory out\u00ad lined, Laetrile has a destructive effect only. Certainly, this destructive effect is very definite and sometines very quick, but it does have to be borne in mind that Laetrile makes no contribution whatever toward the remainder of the patient's problem-reconstruc\u00ad tion and repair. From the very nature of the action of Laetrile, it will be obvious that under certain circumstances, hemorrhage might take place and mechanical problems involving the disposal of neu\u00ad rotic breakdown problems might arise. 10 In a later pamphlet by Dr. Krebs, Sr., the following statements were made with respect to laetrile: Laetrile does not palliate, it acts chemically to kill the cancer cell selectively without injury to the nor\u00ad may tissues of the body. The usual daily dose of Laetrile is 10 mg. of the glucoside amygdalin for every pound of the pa\u00ad tient's weight. Some patients may need 15 or even 20 mgs. but rarely more except in cases of pan\u00ad creatitis enzymes insufficiency due to inhibitation ... Laetrile is dissolved in sterile distilled water using 4 to 5 cc for every 1000 mgs. of Laetrile. The injections should be given intravenously every day until ... They are not only important food for nutrition they also act as a vitamin to supply the body with the CN 69 Id., Exh. 5 . .,0 Id., Exh. 2. 48 group for the biosynthesis of another vitamin cyanocobalamine. 11 The record abounds with other examples of labeling changes with respect to laetrile. For instance, the affi\u00ad davit and supporting exhibits submitted by Robert S. K. Young, Ph.D., compared the labeling and other informa\u00adtion contained in the New Drug Application for laetrile (NDA 14-032) received by the FDA during an establish\u00ad ment inspection of Krebs Laboratories on April 23, 1965. Dr. Young identified some of the significant labeling differences as follows: (a) The formulation of the drug had been changed. In 1962, the formulation contained N, N diisopro\u00ad pylammonium iodide and saccharides in addition to amygdalin and these materials were to be re\u00ad constituted with an isotonic solution. In 1965, the formulation contained only amygdalin and this ma\u00ad terial was to be reconstituted with water, which is not isotonic. (b) The class of patients for whom the drug is recommended had been changed. In 1962, the label characterizes the drug as a palliative agent for use in \"cancers beyond aid by standard agents,\" and warns that \"It is not to be employed to the exclu\u00ad sion of surgery, radiation or similar standard mo\u00ad dalities so long as they are indicated.\" The 1965 labeling states that \"Laetrile does not appliate, it acts chemically \u00b7 to kill the cancer cell selectively without injury to the normal tissues of the body.\" It goes on to warn that \"The physician who is using laetrile to palliate his patients is not doing justice to his patient.\" (c) The interaction of Laetrile with other forms of cancer treatment had been changed. In 1962, the 71 Ad.R. (Affidavit of Robert S.K. Young, M.D., Exhibit C) which includes labeling obtained during an April 23, 1965 inspection of the Krebs Laboratories in San Francisco. 49 label states Laetrile \"has no known therapeutic in\u00ad compatibilities.\" It goes on to warn that \"the gen\u00ad eral enhancement of the clinical condition of the patient is not to be considered as justification for the exclusion of standard modalities so long as they are applicable.\" In the 1965 material, the directions state that \"The less drugs and medicines given, dur\u00ad ing the Laetrile treatment, the better. What should be especially avoided is ... other cancer therapies, strong drugs . . . etc.\" (d) The recommended route of administration had changed. In the 1962 labeling, \"intravenous admin\u00ad istration is preferred.\" The 1965 labeling advises that \"Whenever it's possible to administer Laetrile by injection into the artery supplying the involved area this administration should be used.\" Specifically, injection into the external carotid or its branches, ab\u00ad dominal aorta, or internal iliac arteries is recom\u00ad mended. The 1965 labeling also recommends injec\u00ad tion into the vault of the vagina and scrotal sac, and rectal enemas. I am generally familiar with the literature and reports relating to Laetrile and am aware that since 1965, there has been commercial distribution of dosage forms of Laetrile including tablets containing amygdalin, capsules of ground and a milkshake con\u00ad taining amygdalin all intended for oral use. ( e) The claimed mechanism of action of the drug had changed. In the 1962 material, the \"Beardian thesis\" was discussed as a theory. The 1962 labeling made no claim that Laetrile is a vitamin or pro\u00ad vitamin, or that cancer is a deficiency disease. The 1965 labeling states that \"Cancer is a deficiency disease\" and there is a presentation of what role amydalin plays in the therapy of cancer in light of cancer of deficiency disease. 11. All of the above changes are medically important or have medically important implications that must 50 be reviewed scientifically. In the same order as I have reviewed them in 10, they are: a. Formulation changes may reflect changes in the drug substance, and always reflect changes in the material to be administered. Whenever the material to be administered is changed, it is important that the new material be essentially identical to the old material in strength, quality and purity. b. The 1962 labeling restricts the use of Lae\u00ad trile to those patients who all have conventional therapy, and prescribes use for the purpose of palliation of their disease. The 1965 labeling states that this drug should be used to mitigate the effects of the disease and implies that the drug is of curative value. Since Laetrile has no demonstrable effect on cancer, to use Laetrile in lieu of conventional therapy is to condemn to certain death those patients with curable forms of cancer, and to prolong the pain and suffering of those patients with treatable forms of cancer. c. The 1962 mailing label warns that the con\u00ad ventional therapy not be withheld during Lae\u00ad trile administration. The 1965 labeling suggest conventional therapy. Again, since Laetrile has no demonstrable effect on cancer, to use Laetrile in lieu of conventional therapy is to condemn to certain death those patients with curable forms of cancer and to prolong the pain and suffering of those patients with treatable forms of cancer. d. Changes in the route of administration of a drug must always be scientifically validated. A drug may not be effective or may be more toxic when given by different routes of administration. The recommendation in 1965 that the drug be given by intra-arterial injection is particularly hazardous. These high pressure blood vessels 51 are difficult to enter successfully and are prone to continued bleeding after entry with a needle. e. The claimed mechanism of action strongly suggest that Laetrile has a rational basis as a cancer therapy. Since it has no demonstrable value as a cancer therapy, to suggest that it has may influence some to use it who might not otherwise use it. 12 Dr. Young's conclusion regarding \"the numerous changes which have occurred in the composition, labeling, routes of administration, dosage form, intended uses and identity\" of laetrile between 1962 and 1965 73 in and of itself precludes laetrile from entitlement to the grand\u00ad father exemption contained in Section 107 ( c) ( 4) . 74 Ernest Krebs, Jr. at the hearings in Missouri stated that the dosage recommended for amygdalin has grown from 50 milligrams in 1932 to 17,000 milligrams today. 7'5 The book \"World Without Cancer\" discredits the 1953 California report of the analysis of patients treated with laetrile on the basis that the dosage given them was too low, only one fifteenth of the dose used now. 76 Dr. Carl Leventhal sets forth an apt illustration of the importance of consistency in drug formulation and con\u00ad tent: Production of drugs may in a rough sense be anal\u00ad ogized to baking a cake. Two cooks may start with identical ingredients, but the results of their labors may have different characteristics even if the same 72 Ad.R. 201 (Affidavit of Robert S.K. Young, Ph.D.) at 2. 13 ld. at 2. 74 Pub. L. 87-781, reprinted at 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321 note and in Appendix B hereto. 75 Ad.Tr. 238 (Testimony of Ernest Krebs, Jr.). 76 Tr. 333. 52 recipe is used. In the case of drugs, slight and fre\u00ad quently unnoticed deviations in processing result in the production of essentially different drugs. This is particularly true in the case of amygdalin, since, during the manufacturing process, if ground, moist kernels are, prior to dilution, allowed to stand for a period of time, such as overnight, any amygdalin presented in the material can be transformed into cyanide, benzaldehyde, and sugar by enzymatic ac\u00ad tion. In such an instance there would be a dimi\u00ad nished amount of or no amygdalin in the finished product.\" Ad.R. 434 at M 279 It is manifest that both the composition of laetrile and the manufacturer's claims with respect to its use have changed dramatically over the years. Accordingly, lae\u00ad trile does not meet the continuity-of-labeling require\u00ad ments of the 1962 grandfather exemption and thus is not excused from the \"new drug\" requirement of the Food and Drug Act. 3. Laetrile Is Not Entitled To Grandfather Sta\u00ad tus Because It Was Not Used or Sold Com\u00ad mercially Within the United States Prior to October 9, 1962 Although the record contains evidence of use by physi\u00ad cians and others of a substance called laetrile prior to October 10, 1962, this limited use fails to constitute com\u00admercial use or sale as required by the grandfather pro\u00ad visions of the 1962 amendments. The requirements of commercial use or sale within the United States set forth in qualification (A) of the 1962 grandfather clause 7'7 means that the item must have been openly and readily available in the ordinary course of business as well as 77 Section 107(c)(4), Pub. L. 87-781, reprinted at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321 noted in the statutory appendix. 53 free of all restrictions placed on investigational use.'118 Laetrile fails to meet either of these criteria. First, laetrile certainly has not been openly and read\u00ad ily available in the ordinary course of business. The only record evidence of laetrile's marketing concerns limited and isolated manufacturing and distribution in the United States and some use outside of the United States. Use outside of the United States is not relevant to the grand\u00ad father exemptions in that the law specifically limits ap\u00ad plicability to substances sold in the United States. Sec\u00adond, laetrile sales that did take place within the United States were neither widespread nor unqualified. According to the developer of laetrile, the use of the drug in the U.S. was clearly for investigational purposes only. In an affidavit executed by Dr. Krebs, Sr. in 1965 he claimed: 7. As early as 1926 and up through 1962, I first began to ship and have done so continuously there\u00ad after the Scarcarcinase extract ( cf2) (cf3), the purified and lyophilized amygdalin ( 5) , and then since 1949 ( cf 6) the latter under the name Laetrile to persons in other States outside of the State of California and in many other countries. The above shipments were for investigational use only.79 In fact, the record demonstrates that the manufac\u00ad turers of laetrile held it forth for investigational use only as late as 1970. In 1962, an application for a new drug application ( NDA) was submitted to the FDA for its consideration and in 1970 an application of an In- 78 Durovic v. Richardson, 479 F.2d 242, 247-48 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 944. 79 Ad.R. 183 (Affidavit of W. Sherwood Lawrence, M.D.), Attach. 6, at 2 ( emphasis added). 54 vestigational New Drug (IND) also was submitted.80 These actions are significant because it has been judi\u00ad cially recognized that the presentation of an IND or NDA to the FDA implies that on those dates the drug involved was a \"new drug\"; otherwise the NDA or IND would not be required. 81 Thus, the proponents of laetrile by their own actions have characterized laetrile as \"new\" and \"investiga\u00ad tional,\" and hence not \"commercial\" within the meaning of the 1962 transitional provisions. Consequently, laetrile is not entitled to a grandfather exemption. Finally, the commercial availability of the chemical amygdalin from drug supply houses cannot provide a buttress for the district courts finding that laetrile was commercially marketed prior to October 9, 1962 (Pet. App. at pp. 29a-30a note 21). As Dr. Carl Leventhal made clear on the record in the rulemaking proceeding, the commercial availability of a chemical used for drug formulation purposes \"does not establish protection under a grandfather clause for a finished dosage form of that chemical when it is labeled and offered for drug use.\" 82 Dr. Leventhal illustrates as follows: In this regard amygdalin is no different from any other chemicals and botanical substances from which newer preparations are derived. For instance, rau\u00ad wolfia serpentian, a climbing shrub, contains in its root, reserpine, and has been used for centuries for medicinal purposes. However, when reserpine was extracted from rauwolfia reserpine, processed into a finished dosage form, and labeled for particular 80 See Id., Ad.R. 184, Ad.R 434, Ad.R. 201, and Ad.R. 431, (Af\u00ad fidavits of W. Sherwood Lawrence, M.D., Carl M. Leventhal, M.D., Robert S.K. Young, M.D., Bryant L. Jones). 81 Durovic v. Richardson, 479 F.2d 247 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 944. s2 Ad.R. 434 at M 278. 55 therapeutic uses, it was and is considered to be a new entity. The same is true of Laetrile or Vitamin B-17 for these drugs are different in not only their composition and dosage form, but bear labeling claims which were not associated with the ancient botanical sources.ss The ingredients used to manufacture the alleged cancer drug may have been available commercially but the com\u00ad mercially available substances were not sold as treatment for cancer.'84 It is the product produced from the various ss Id. at page M 278-79; see Ad.R. 416 at M 70-71. 84 Ad.R. 434 at M 278-79; Ad.R. 416 at M 70-71. The commercially available chemical compounds referred by Dr. Burk, the bitter almond listed on the \"GRAS\" list (Generally Regarded As Safe) of the FDA, is an oil used for flavoring and contains no amygdalin. It is not as suggested by Dr. Burk, laetrile Affidavit Exhibits I and J. Further, the oil of bitter almond com\u00ad pound referred to in the Merck Index is not the compound sug\u00ad gested for cancer treatment by Mr. Krebs. And the references to its use in Egypt or Russia for malignancies is pure and unsub\u00ad stantiated hearsay. Ad.R. 434, Ad.R. 435. (Testimony of Richard H. Lange, M.D.) Indeed, the use in Russia was of a sweet almond mixture thought to be a narcotic. Ad.R. 434 at M 278. The claim made by the laetrile proponents in the FDA proceedings that the drug is grandfathered because it was contained in the Merck Index or used by the ancient Egyptians were in substantial part pre\u00ad sented for court decision in! Hanson v. United States, 417 F. Supp. 30, 36 (D. Minn. 1976). Unpersuaded, the court stated: The only evidence presented by the plaintiffs. to try to estab\u00ad lish that their tablets and vials of laetrile are exempt under the \"grandfather\" clause of \u00a7 321(p) (1) consists of the 1896 edition of Merck's Index and hearsay concerning the use of amygdalin during historical times dating back to the ancient Egyptians. This evidence is patently insufficient to demon\u00ad strate that the exemption applies. Merck's Index contains no information about the intended use of amygdalin, providing only certain facts as to its physical appearance, melting point, and source. The only reference to the conditions of its use is the phrase \"Keep well stoppered.\" There is no indication there\u00ad in that amygdalin in tablet form or in liquid form was in use for any purpose whatsoever; there is certainly no indication that amygdalin liquid was being injected intravenously into human beings or that amygdalin tablets were being ingested 56 available chemical compounds that is the allegedly cancer active agent to be evaluated, not the independent chemi\u00ad cal ingredients. 4. Laetrile Is Not Entitled To A Grandfather Exemption Under The 1962 Drug Act Amend\u00ad ments Because The Drug Has Never Been Gen\u00ad erally Recognized As Safe For The Treatment Of Cancer Either In Terms Of Toxicity Or Effectiveness a. The general recognition standard. The elements required for general recognition of safety are correctly stated by the Commissioner in his decision at Pet. App. 155a: . . . for a drug to be generally recognized as safe it must have accumulated at least the amount of evi\u00ad dence and safety that would be required for the ap\u00ad proval of a new drug application and that evi\u00ad dence must be generally available to the community of experts through publication in the scientific liter\u00ad ature. In order for a new drug application for a drug to be approved, there must exist as to that drug \"adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable\" that show the drug's safety (21 U.S.C. 355 (d); cf. 21 CFR 314.111 (a) (1)) The Commissioner's criteria tracks this Court's decision in the Hynson case. This Court in Hynson conceded that while Section 201(p) of the Act was both \"quantitative and qualitative\", on its face it failed to offer definitive guidance to the FDA with respect to its enforcement be\u00ad cause a definition of what constitutes \"general recogni\u00ad tion\" among experts was not to be found in the Act. by human beings. In short, there has been no showing by the plaintiffs that laetrile tablets or liquid were \"subject to\" the Act prior to the enactment of\u00a7 321(p)(l), and no showing that \"at such time its labeling contained the same representations concerning the conditions of its use.\" 57 Consequently, this Court looked to the overall statutory scheme of the Act and the overriding purpose of the 1962 Amendments and then articulated the standard to be applied, namely, that general recognition by experts presupposes an expert consensus founded upon substan\u00ad tial evidence as defined in Section 505 (d) of the Act. 412 U.S. at 632. The elements of substantial evidence as set forth in that Section of the Act consists of ade\u00ad quate and well-controlled investigations, including clini\u00ad cal investigations by experts qualified by scientific train\u00ad ing and experience to evaluate the drug involved, in this case for safety. The quality of these investigations should be such that the experts can conclude from them whether the drug will, in this case, be safe under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling. The scientific evalu\u00ad ation criteria articulated by this Court affords to the consumer the protections envisioned by then President Kennedy when he recommended the strengthening of the federal drug laws. \"The physician and consumer should have the assurance, from an impartial scientific source, that any drug or therapeutic device on the market today is safe and effective for its use; that it has the strength and quality represented; and that the accompanying promotional material tells the full story-its bad effects as well as its good.\" (1962) U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, 4143-4144.815 85 See also Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Ass'n v. Richardson, 318 F. Supp. 301, 307 (D. Del. 1970), in which the court cited wit\u00ad nesses before the hearings leading to the 1962 Drug Amendments corroborating President Kennedy's call for impartial judgments on drugs: \"(A) collection of impressions will (not) furnish the truth ... (T)his approach did not prevent doctors from having unbound faith in the curative powers of leeches for hundreds of years before scientific evaluation became the preferred means of judging efficacy of therapy ... (The) magnitude of sales of a drug after vigorous promotion is no recommendation for its usefulness or efficacy ... \" [Footnote continued on page 58] 58 The district court pays lip service to the general recog\u00ad nition criteria but its application of that criteria falls short. The district court relies not on the scientific con\u00ad sensus reflected in the record as a whole, from experts qualified by scientific credentials and recognition of their status by their peers, but rather on selective ancedotal experiences and submissions of laetrile proponents which are not supported by the objective scientific testing and respected publication criteria which are required by this 85 [Continued] See also, the opinion of Judge Smith in United States v. Ar\u00ad ticles of Food and Drug, 372 F. Supp. 915, 920-921 (N.D. Ga. 1974) : Quite properly, it is simply not enough to show that some peo\u00ad ple, even experts, have a belief in safety and effectiveness. A reason\u00ad abl~ number of Americans will sincerely attest to the worth of al\u00ad most any product or even idea. To remove the aberrations in uni\u00ad formity which can result from a well-staged \"swearing match,\" the law requires more. Indeed, it has been heretofore held that the purpose of the normal inquiry is not to determine safety and effectiveness at all, but to ascertain the drug's general reputation in the scientific community for such characteristics. United States v. 41 Cases, More or Less, 420 F.2d 1126 (5th Cir. 1970); AMP, Inc. v. Gardner, 389 F.2d 825 (2nd Cir. 1968), cert. den., 393 U.S. 825, 89 S.Ct. 86, 21 L.Ed.2d 95 (1968). It is certain that a conflicting reputation is insufficient to establish general recognition. United States v. An Article of Drug-Furestrol Vaginal Suppositories, 294 F.Supp. 1307 (N.D. Ga. 1968), aff'd 415 F.2d 390 (5th Cir. 1969). Therefore, what is required is more than belief, even by an ex\u00ad pert; it is a general recognition based upon substantial scientific evidence as delineated in the regulatory guidelines. 21 CFR \u00a7 130.12. Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, 609, 619, 93 St. Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). There is no reason to dif\u00ad ferentiate the holding in Hynson between human drugs, and animal drugs. United States v. 14 Cases-Naremco Medimatic, 374 F.Supp. 922 (W.D. Mo., Number 2806, January 29, 1974). Public health considerations are similar. Further, logic would dictate no lesser standard after-the-fact than in securing an application. Indeed, the reasoning of the Supreme Court appears to, be that \"the reach of scientific inquiry\" is the same whatever the forum. Weinberger v. Bentex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 412 U.S. 645(b), 93 S.Ct. 2d 235 (1973). [Emphasis added; footnote omitted.] 59 Court. In contrast, in arriving at his decision that there is no general recognition of the safety of laetrile, the Com\u00ad missioner, as detailed below, scrutinized the record as a whole and evaluated the evidence quantitatively and quali\u00ad tatively by application of the standards obtained in the statute as interpreted by this Court. b. The safety standard. Where life-threatening ill\u00ad nesses such as cancers are involved, satisfaction of the safety standard of the grandfather clause must include a showing that the drug is both effective and non-toxic. The effectiveness requirement is discussed at pp. 15-18, SU'[Yf'a. Briefly, at the hearings on the 1962 drug amend\u00ad ments, Secretary Ribicoff informed the Committee con\u00ad sidering the bill that where progressive of life-threatening diseases such as cancer were involved, the administrative agency already required a showing of effectiveness as well as drug safety. The Senate report on the bill es\u00ad tablishes that this administrative practice was expressly preserved vis a vis the new drug amendments: \"The provisions of the bill are in no way intended to affect any existing authority . . . to consider and evaluate the eff ec\u00ad tiveness of a new drug in the context of passing upon its safety\" (1962) U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 2892. If effectiveness, as found by the district court as a matter of law ( Pet. App. at page 28, note 18) could not be considered by the Commissioner in passing upon the \"safety\" of a drug intended for cancer, the Com\u00ad missioner's pre-existing authority would certainly be \"af\u00ad fected\". His authority would be diminished. The lan\u00ad guage of the Committee interpreting the reach of the proposed legislation permits no such result. Further, the requirement that drugs used in treatment of life-threatening diseases be effective in order to meet the \"safety\" standards of the 1962 grandfather exemp\u00adtion was squarely addressed in the Durovic decision. After recounting the administrative interpretation ac-60 corded by the FDA to the safety requirement and after reviewing pertinent legislative history, the Court of Ap\u00ad peals in Durovic concluded: Bearing in mind the weight properly accorded to administrative construction, and Congressional awareness of the administrative view that the con\u00ad cept of safety in the law before the 1962 amend\u00ad ments included the concept of effectiveness for its indicated use where the drug is offered for use in the treatment of life-threatening disease, we think the definition of new drug before the amendments should be construed accordingly. It would follow that a drug offered for use in the treatment of cancer is now, and was before the amendments, a new drug unless it has achieved general recognition among the experts as safe and effective for such use. Under that analysis, the status of a drug offered for such use would be subjected to the same test before and after the amendments, and the grand\u00adfather clause would have no effect on it. 86 The record in the rulemaking proceeding supports the Commissioner's decision that there exists an overwhelm\u00ad ing consensus among qualified experts that laetrile was not generally recognized as safe in terms of effective for the treatment of cancer on October 9, 1962. Typical of the views of qualified experts toward laetrile is that of David T. Carr, M.D., a Professor of Medicine at the Mayo Medical School with wide experience in the cancer field. According to Dr. Carr: I am informed and understand that amygdalin is a cyanogenic glycoside. Cyanogenic glycosides are chemicals which contain in their molecular structure a sugar, a non-sugar, and the cyanide group, (-C N). I know of no cyanogenic glycoside that is gen\u00ad erally recognized as safe and effective for the pre- 86 479 F.2dat 250 (footnotes omitted). 61 vention, treatment or cure of cancer, for the re\u00ad lief of pain associated with cancer, or for any medi\u00ad cal purpose. The composition of the cyanogenic glycosides, in general, and of amygdalin, in particu\u00ad lar, is such that I do not recognize them, and they are not generally recognized among experts qualified through scientific training and experience to evaluate drugs, as safe and effective for the treatment of cancer, for propylaxis against cancer, for relief of pain associated with cancer, or for any medical use. Neither amygdalin nor any other cyanogenic gly\u00ad coside was generally recognized as safe for any such uses on October 19, 1962. None of these substances has ever been so recognized. The scientific litera\u00ad ture contains no reports of adequate, well-controlled, scientific studies, or other evidence upon which such recognition may be predicated. I know of no recog\u00ad nized medical test in which use of amygdalin or any cyanogenic glycoside is recommended. I know of no medical school where use of these substances is taught. I know of no expert in cancer chemother\u00ad apy who is of the view that there is evidence these substances have any useful effect in treating can\u00ad cer. I know of no report in the scientific literature describing an adequate, well-controlled study which demonstrates that amygdalin or any cyanogenic gly\u00adcoside is safe and effective. Furthermore, I know of no cancer expert who would want a member of his family or himself to be treated with amygdalin if cancer should develop. 87 87 Ad.R. 176 at 4E, see also affidavits of: Robert C. Eyerly, M.D. (Ad.R. 167); George J. Hill, II, M.D. (Ad.R. David M.D. (Ad.R. (Ad.R.181); W. Sherwood Lawrence, M.D. (Ad.R. 183) ; Carl M. Leventhal, M.D. (Ad.R. 184) ; Daniel S.

Mellette, M.D. (Ad.R. 420). 62 As noted above, it is considered particularly significant by the courts in determining the presence or absence of general recognition by experts as to safety whether ade\u00ad quate and well-controlled investigations of the drug have been accomplished and whether there is present a body of credible literature affirming safety.ss The record in this case is devoid of evidence establishing that such investigations as toxicity/efficacy have been accomplished. To the contrary, the record abounds with sworn testimony by specialists well acquainted with the relevant literature and the state of expert opinion concerning cancer re\u00ad search, who declare without exception that no recognized expert in the field of cancer believes now or has ever be\u00ad lieved that laetrile is safe or effective for the treatment of that disease. In the opinion of many experts, laetrile is highly toxic when taken orally.89 Other experts note that there is a lack of evidence establishing that laetrile is non-toxic when taken parentally. According to the affidavit of Thomas H. Jukes, Ph.D.: Most items used as foods are not safe for in\u00ad jection, and amygdalin under the name, \"laetrile\", is frequently injected into cancer patients, apparently without immediate toxic effects. The toxic effects of injecting foreign substances may not show up for months or years. To be safe for injectable purposes, a compound must be shown by means of long-term toxicity tests not to produce pathological changes. No such data are available for amygdalin. (Ad.R. 416 at 1756.) In this respect, it must be kept in mind that the grandfather exemption requires a positive showing that 88 U.S. v. 1,048,000 Capsules More or Less, 347 F. Supp. 768, 771 (S.D. Tex. 1972). 89 See e.g., Affidavits of Joseph F. Ross, M.D., Ad.R. 190, Chester Stock, Ph.D., Ad.R. 195, Donald C.S. Tan, M.D., Ad.R. 197, Exhibit 5. And see the chart on general recognition of safety at pp. 69-71, infra. 63 a drug had been generally recognized by qualified experts as non-toxic. There is no \"presumption\" of such general recognition; it is not neecessary to affirmatively demon\u00ad strate toxicity. Rather, the burden of proof remains on those who seek to invoke the grandfather exemption. Such an affirmative showing is absent from this record. Additionally, where there has been little testing of a drug or where there is a dearth of medical literature on the question of its toxicity, the drug cannot possibly meet the grandfather requirements of general recognition among qualified experts. United States v. 41 Cases, More or Less, 420 F.2d 1126 (5th Cir. 1970). See dis\u00ad cussion at pp. 56-59, supra. Finally, a recent Massachusetts court order in a case involving a minor treated with laetrile and a coroner's report of a laetrile patient death attributed to acute cyanide poisoning both support the emerging profile of laetrile as a toxic and dangerous substance. In the case involving the child llo Judge Guy Volterra by Interlocutory Order of January 22, 1979, after find\u00ad ing that the child's parents were giving him laetrile which \"is dangerous to health\", directed the parents to submit the minor to urine thiocynate and serum thiocynate tests to monitor whether the child is at risk of chronic cyanide poisoning.01 After receiving the report of the physician, by order of January 31, 1979, Judge Volterra found that the child indeed was suffering from chronic cyanide poisoning stemming from laetrile therapy: \"The Court has accepted into evidence today a new laboratory test which indicates a level of free cyanide in the child's blood at twice the normal level.\" 112 9\u00b0 Custody of a Minor, Superior Court Civil Docket No. 78-6815, Commonwealth of Mass., Plymouth Division, The Courts orders of January 22, 1979 and January 31, 1979 are appended hereto as Appendix C. 91 Jd. 92 Jd. 64 The Coroner of Alameda County, California, in a re\u00ad port attached as Appendix B, determined that a female cancer patient who was receiving laetrile treatment died of cyanide intoxication. The cyanide levels in her blood were 3/8 mcg/ml. The deceased's laetrile treatment com\u00ad menced in March of 1978 with a dosage of 9 grms every day for 30 days, then reduced to 3 grrns thrice weekly, later reduced to twice weekly and she was on the last course of treatment ( once a week injections) when she died. If the deceased was unable to come in for injec\u00ad tions, her instructions were to take 1000 mgm tablet of laetrile. As graphically demonstrated on Tables A and B which follow, laetrile has not satisfied the general recognition criteria for safety either in terms of toxicity or effective\u00ad ness1 neither has it shown consistency in formulation, purity, mechanism of action, labeling, claims, dosages, or method of administration, all of which are required to gain a grandfather exception. The record supports the Commissioner's denial of such an exception and the error of the district court in granting an exemption.

For a drug to be recognized as safe, it must have accumulated evidence of safety through adequate tests and that evidence must be generally available to qualified experts through publication in the scientific lit\u00ad erature (Pet. App. 155a). Bearings upon safety criteria is whether there is general recognition of Laetrile's use, formu\u00ad lation, conditions or use (Pet. App. 201a-204a). Further, as discussed at pp. 14-18 supra, safety in terms of life\u00ad threatening illness is by court and administrative construc\u00ad tion prior to 1962 held to include effectiveness. This table scrutinizes general recognition of safety both as to the rec\u00ad ord on \"effectiveness\" as well as \"toxicity\". Finally, it should be noted (Pet. App. 114a) that this general recogni\u00adtion standard applies to adequate and well-controlled clinical (human) trials, not animal tests. However, the effects noted in animal tests reinforce the experts view on the toxicity of Laetrile.

THE USE OF LAETRILE IN CONNECTION WITH ONE'S PERSONAL HEALTH CARE IS NOT PRO\u00ad TECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION A. Overview The district court in its decision found a general right to use laetrile: \"By denying the right to use a nontoxic substance in connection with one's own personal health\u00ad care, FDA has offended the constitutional right of pri\u00ad vacy\" (Pet. App. 14a).~3 In doing so, the district court adopted the position of the laetrile proponents be\u00ad low that the premarketing requirements of the Act violate the cancer patient's right to privacy by inhibit\u00ad ing access to drugs which have not been proven safe and effective. This contention [ratified by the district court, and scrutinized here as an alternative avenue of affirm\u00adance or, as the Society submits, rejection of the court of appeals decision] raises the issue of whether the amor\u00ad phous right of privacy encompasses the right to choose unsafe and ineffective drugs. Traditionally, regulating health has been viewed as a valid and important exercise of the police power. 94 As such, health regulations have been upheld upon a demon\u00ad stration of a rational or reasonable relationship between the statute and the purpose of the legislation.00 However, should this Court decide that a patient has a fundamental 93 The error of the district court in assuming that laetrile is non-toxic is discussed supra at pp. 59-71. The effects of per\u00ad mitting access to laetrile to the terminally ill on the public health and welfare are treated supra at pp. 23-33. 94 \"It is elemental that a State has broad power to establish and enforce standards of conduct within its borders relative to the health of everyone therein. It is a vital part of the State's police power.\" Barsky v. Board of Regents of New York, 347 U.S. 442 (1963). 95 See Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962) ; Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955). 73 right to take a drug which has not met the safety and efficacy requirements of the Act, and thereby evoke strict judicial scrutiny, the government must justify its intru\u00ad sion upon the patient's choice by demonstrating a com\u00ad pelling interest in the pre-marketing standard.96 The American Cancer Society maintains that the safety and efficacy requirements should be judged under the rationale basis standard.'91 However, should this Court elect to ex\u00ad pand \"right of privacy\" to include access to drugs which have not met the FDA premarketing requirements, the national interest in assuring the safety and effectiveness of a drug before it reaches the consumer and the causal nexus between the premarketing standards and the pur\u00ad pose of the legislation indicate that the compelling state interest standard has been met. B. There Is No Absolute Right To Do With One's Body As One Chooses As this Court noted in Paris Adult Theatre I. v. Slayton: The State statute books are replete with constitu\u00ad tionally unchallenged laws against prostitution, sui\u00ad cide, voluntary self-mutilation, brutalizing \"bare fist\" prize fights and duels, although these crimes may only directly involve \"consenting adults\". Stat\u00ad utes making bigamy a crime surely cut into an in\u00ad dividual's freedom to associate but few today seri\u00adously claim that such statutes violate the First Amendment or any other constitutional provision. 98 96 Kramer v. Union Free School District, 395 U.S. 621, 627 (1969), Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618,634 (1969). 97 This Court applied this standard when considering the consti\u00ad tutional implications of a state physician/patient identification pro\u00ad cedure with the prescription of Schedule II drugs. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589 (1977). The rational basis test was also applied when the Court considered the validity of a state statute outlawing a particular abortion procedure. Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976). 98 413 U.S. 46, 68 (1973). 74 This Court has upheld compulsory military service,99 compulsory vaccinations, 100 and compulsory sterilization.1'01 Blood transfusions have been authorized despite the patient's unwillingness to consent.rn2 Courts have uni\u00ad versally rejected the argument that there is a constitu\u00ad tional right to use marijuana in the privacy of one's own home.103 In an analogous area, this Court has summarily affirmed a decision rejecting claims that state legislation requiring motorcyclists to wear protective helmets vio\u00ad lated the right to privacy.104 These cases have rejected the argument that govern\u00ad mental imposition of self-protective regulations is an unconstitutional invasion of a person's autonomy and right to be let alone. They collectively indicate that the gov\u00ad ernment has a supportable interest in limiting personal choice to protect an individual against the possibility of self-harm. In the case of drugs, such as Laetrile, where it is substantially more difficult for the individual to make an informed and rational judgment, this governmental interest would appear to be even stronger. C. Cases Cited By The District Court Do Not Ade\u00ad quately Support Its Conclusion That There Is A Constitutional Right To Use Laetrile In concluding that there is a constitutional right to use drugs which have not met the FDA premarketing 99 Selective Service Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366 (1918). 100 Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905). 101 Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927). :w2 See e.g., Application of the President and Directors of George\u00ad town College, Inc., 331 F.2d 1000 (D.C.

See Note \"Motor\u00ad cycle Helmets and the Constitutionality of Self-Protective Legis\u00ad lation\", 30 Ohio State Law Journal 359 (1969). 75 requirements 10'5 the district court relied primarily 1J()l5a upon Justice Douglas' reference to \"the freedom to care for one's health and person\" in his concurring opinion in Roe v. Wade 106 and Doe v. Bolton.101 In an apparent at\u00ad tempt to shape the penumbra concept he first articulated in Griswold v. Connecticut,1.0s Justice Douglas indicated 105 The district court found a constitutional right to use a non\u00ad toxic substance in connection with one's personal health-care (Pet. App. 41a). The assumption that Laetrile is non-toxic has been substantially refused above, however, for the purposes of this dis\u00ad cussion, we will assume non-toxicity. 1.o5a The district court also suggested that the opportunity to take Laetrile comes within the right \"to be let alone\", first articulated by Justice Brandeis in his dissenting opinion in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928). This suggestion overlooks the context of which Justice Brandeis initially conceived that right. In his famous dissent Justice Brandeis contended that the makers of our Constitution: Sought to protect Americans in their beliefs., in their thoughts, their emotions, and their sensations. They confer, as against the government, the right to be let alone---the most compre\u00ad hensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men. To protect that right every unjustifiable intrusion by the government upon the privacy of the individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a violation of the Fourth Amendment. And the use, as evidence in a criminal proceed\u00ad ing of facts ascertained by such intrusion must be deemed a vio\u00ad lation of the Fifth. The right to be let alone is then the right of an individual to be protected from governmental surveillance, intrusion and/or dis\u00ad closure of private affairs. Read in context, the \"right to be let alone\" has entirely different constitutional underpinnings than those at issue with the drug Laetrile. Regulation of health and health care, unlike government surveillance, intrusion or disclosure of personal matters which are specifically prohibited by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, is not only an area in which governmental action has traditionally been accepted, it is also an area in which government action is expected. 100 Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). 107 Doev. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973). 10s 381 U.S. 479 (1965). 76 his belief that the concept of liberty includes the follow\u00ad ing rights: ( 1) Control over the developement and expression of one's intellect, interests, tastes and personality; (2) freedom of choice in the basic decisions of one's life respecting marriage, divorce, procreation, contra\u00ad ception and the education and upbringing of children; and (3) freedom to care for one's health and person, freedom from bodily restraint or compulsion, free\u00ad dom to walk, stroll or lope.109 After asserting that this third group of rights are funda\u00ad mental and subject to regulation only upon a showing of compelling state interest, Justice Douglas does not cite cases to the effect that freedom to care for one's health is among the fundamental rights subject to strict scrutiny under the Constitution. The discussion follow\u00ad ing the third group of rights concerns only freedom from bodily restraints, freedom of movement, and protection pursuant to the Fourth Amendment from governmental intrusion. The concept of health care is not delineated or defined by Justice Douglas. Further, Justice Douglas was not joined in his concurring opinion. Significantly, later opinions of this Court in discussing the concept of liberty in the context of personal privacy have not subscribed in full to Justice Douglas' laundry list of fundamental rights. 110 In fact, only the task of protecting the familiar freedoms, which Justice Douglas recognized in his second group of freedoms, has required this Court to resort to the privacy rationale of Roe, supra. Specifically, Justice Rhenquist writing for the majority in Paul v. Davis characterized the activities the Roe Court found within .the guarantee of personal privacy as dealing with \"matters relating to marriage, procrea- 109 410 U.S. at 211-213. 110 Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 713 (1976). 77 tion, contraception, family relationships and child rear\u00ad ing and education. In these areas it has been held that there are limitations on the state's power to substantively regulate conduct.\" 111 Clearly, the right of privacy found in familial or social relationships differs markedly from the right that is involved when the individual desires to take a drug which may be toxic and whose efficacy has not been proved in a series of objective scientific tests. 112 Furthermore, as observed by at least four commenta\u00ad tors, recent Court decisions demonstrate a tendency to regard the right of privacy not as a penumbra! product, but rather a right attendant upon the more explicit pro\u00ad visions of the Bill of Rights or as a right emanating from the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amend\u00ad ment.113 D. Decision To Undergo Treatment Versus The Right Of Choice Among Medical Alternatives Illustrative of the principle that choice among medical alternatives is not at this time a decision within the zone of constitutionally protected privacy is this Court's holding in Planned Parenthood v. Danforth.114 There, this Court struck down a state prohibition of a particular abortion procedure, saline amniocentesis.1rn However, the Court did not hold that the prohibition violated any right to privacy. It did not hold that, because the right of privacy encompasses a woman's decision to have an 111 Id. 112 See supra at pp. 56-59. 113 Levy, Martin R. and Hectus, C. Thomas, \"Privacy Revisited: The Downfall of Griswold\", 12 University of Richmond Law Re\u00ad view 627 (1978); Hayman, Phillip B. and Barzelay, Douglas E. \"The Forest and the Trees: Roe v. Wade and Its Critics\", 53 Bos\u00ad ton University Law Review 765 (1973). 114428 u .s. 52 ( 1976). 115 Id. at 79. 78. abortion, the state may not prohibit a particular abortion procedure. Rather, citing Roe, supra, the Court stated the issue before it as follows: \"(W)hether the flat pro\u00ad hibition of saline amniocentesis is a restriction which 'reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health' \".ue The Court cited voluminous record evidence of the safety and effectiveness of saline amniocentesis, as com\u00ad pared with other available abortion procedures, and con\u00ad cluded that the state prohibition bore no reasonable re\u00ad lationship to the protection of maternal health. Sig\u00ad nificantly, in discussing the validity of the statutory pro\u00ad hibition of this particular medical procedure, the Court did not refer to any constitutional considerations of pri\u00ad vacy. No such considerations were involved in the selec\u00ad tion of that particular medical procedure by the patient and her physician. The procedure was evaluated by them and by the Court solely on the basis of the medical evi\u00ad dence of its safety and effectiveness.111 Planned Parenthood thus stands for the proposition that although a decision of whether to have an abortion is within the constitutional zone of privacy, deserving the protection provided by the \"compelling interest\" standard, the selection of a particular abortion procedure is a medi\u00ad cal matter to which privacy status does not attach and which may be regulated by government, provided a ra\u00ad tionale basis for such regulation exists. 118 116 Jd,. at 76. 117 The voluminous record evidence discussed in Argument II, supra, on the safety and effectiveness of laetrile vis a vis the pa\u00ad tient with life-threatening or terminal illness makes it clear that there is a reasonable relationship between the premarketing pro\u00ad visions of the Act and the public health and welfare. 118 Similarly, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), where the Court held that unmarried individuals have a privacy right to purchase and to use contraceptives, the Court noted that the contra\u00ad ceptives themselves, if they are new drugs within the meaning of the Act would be subject to the premarket approval under Section 505, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 855. Id. at 452. See also Whalen v. Rose, 429 U.S. 598 (1977). 79 In the instant case, the analogue of the right to decide whether to have an abortion is the right to decide whether to receive or forego cancer treatment. But although the decision whether to receive treatment may be constitu\u00ad tionally protected, the choice among treatment alterna\u00ad tives is not within the scope of the constitutional right to privacy. The issue is rather, whether \"the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health.\" m Its analogue is whether the pre\u00ad marketing provisions of the Act reasonably relate to the preservation and protection of the health of the cancer patient. E. The Governmental Interest In Protecting Indi\u00ad vidual Health And Public Health Provides Com\u00ad pelling Justification For The Application Of Pre\u00ad Marketing Requirements To Laetrile Even where the Court has accorded \"fundamental\" con\u00ad stitutional protection to areas of private decision-making, it has recognized that those rights are not absolute; they may be limited by regulation serving compelling public purposes.1210 1. Protection Of Public Health Protection of public health has always been accorded special recognition by the courts as providing compelling justification for state regulation. The Court itself has recognized that where public health and safety are at stake, even fundamental rights may be regulated and restricted under the states police power.121 While finding that the right of privacy is \"broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to termi- 119 Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. at 163. 120 See nn.94-97, supra. 1121 Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. at 153-154, 162-163. 80 nate her pregnancy\", 122 the Court in Roe maintained that at some point in the pregnancy the state's important in\u00ad terests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life become suffi\u00ad ciently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision .. 1;2.a With respect to the health of the mother, the Court concluded that the \"compelling\" point is at approximately the end of the first trimester.u.4 This conclusion was based on the medical fact that the risk of a woman's death in first trimester abortions appears to be at least as low as that in normal child birth,= while the increase in the hazards to abortion procedure in the second trimester justified imposition of state regulations. With respect to the state's interest in potential life, the compelling point was found to be at viability-which occurs approximately at the end of the second trimester. At this point the Court indicated that the state could even prohibit abortion except where neces\u00ad sary for the preservation of maternal life or health.126 These aspects of the holding in Roe are significant in light of the constitutional issue raised, for they reflect this Court's recognition of the government's compelling interest in protecting individual health, and in protecting the public health generally where individual conduct may adversely affect the well-being of others.127 The authority 122 Id. at 153. 1123 Id. at 154. mid. at 163. ms Id. 126 Id. at 164-165. 127 Even John Stuart Mill recognized that state regulation in the area of public health did not impermissibly infringe upon the choice of the individual. He contended that where, \"there is a definite damage, or a definite risk of damage, either to an indi\u00ad vidual or to the public, the case is taken out of the province of liberty and placed in that of morality or law.\" J .S. Mill, On Liberty 100 ( Liberty Arts Press 1956). 81 to protect individual health, and the public health gen\u00ad erally, may be exercised to overrule the woman's personal decision to undergo a particular medical or surgical pro\u00ad cedure during the second and third trimesters of preg\u00ad nancy even when she is fully aware of the risks of the procedure, and is willing to take those risks.128 An in\u00ad dividual's decision to use Laetrile can stand on no higher constitutional level than the decision of a woman to have an abortion in the later stages of pregnancy. The FDA seeks to prevent the use of Laetrile because its proponents have failed to meet the premarketing standards for drug approval which Congress estab\u00ad lished in Section 505 of the Act. The effectiveness standard, in particular, is designed to protect the pub\u00ad lic health by ferreting out \"those drugs for which there is no affirmative, reliable evidence of effectiveness.129 Laetrile falls within that class and its prohibition serves compelling public health purposes. In the case of cancer, it has been established on the record that a significant number of patients can be cured or have their lives extended by the use of legitimate therapy, especially when treatment is begun as soon as possible after diagnosis. Ad. R. 173, 42 Fed. Reg. at 39798. 130 The availability of Laetrile serves to encourage delay among certain cancer patients in seeking effective therapy. 42 Fed. Reg. at 39799. Moreover, even among patients who begin treatment of their cancers with effec\u00ad tive therapy, the readily acknowledged side effects of that therapy may cause them to cease to use such methods at a time when their application still may be successful, and turn instead to Laetrile-\"the painless cure\". 42 Fed. Reg. at 39799 and 39797. Because legitimate therapy 12s 410 U.S. at 162-165. 129 Weinberger v.

F. Consent To Treatment With An Unapproved Drug Does Not Override The Government's Interest In The Pre-Marketing Requirements Of The Act This Court has indicated that a patient's desire for and consent to a particular medical treatment would not be sufficient to override a statutory prohibition of the procedure where that prohibition reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of health.131 Even where fundamental rights are at stake, this Court has held that compelling governmental interests will prevail over the interests of a consenting adult.1a:2 Together, the Court's rulings in Planned Parenthood and Roe indicate that the consent of a patient to treatment with Laetrile will not override the government's interest in the safety and efficacy provisions of the Act. Further, measured against this record, the exercise of informed consent to take laetrile does not appear possible. Consent can only reach as far as the information it is based upon. For example, the federal regulations relat\u00ad ing to informed consent us require that a patient be made aware of the benefits of a drug or its discomforts or risks. The district court's consent form does not pro\u00ad vide for this information.134 Further, this record, dis\u00ad cussed supra, establishes not only that Laetrile is not generally recognized as safe or effective for any purpose, it also demonstrates that the lack of knowledge about ::un See cases nn.97, 106, supra.

CONCLUSION Statutes should be given their fair meaning in accord with the evident intent of Congress. See e.g., United States v. Sullivan, 332 U.S. 698 (1948) and United States v. Raynor, 302 U.S. 540 (1938). The court of appeals by writing the terminally ill out of the statute and the district court by its clearly erroneous application of the grandfather exemption and its perversion of the concept of right to privacy protections have construed the federal drug laws and the Constitution in a way that conflicts with the plain meaning, statutory intent and Court in\u00ad terpretation. The course of action advocated by these courts erodes the protections provided by the federal drug laws and poses a significant threat, particularly to those whose illness is life-threatening instead of terminal. For these reasons, the Government's petition to this Court should be granted; the decisions below should be reversed; the decision of the Commissioner should be found to be supported and the courts below directed to adopt that decision as properly declaring the status of the drug Laetrile.

KING, JR. and BROADUS ALLISON, I ntervenors, INRE: JULIAN H. MORGAN, SR. and JULIAN H. MORGAN, JR., Plaintiffs, . vs. DAVID MATTHEWS, as Secretary of Department of Health, Education and Welfare; ALEXANDER M. SCHMIDT, Com\u00ad missioner, Food and Drug Administration; and E. KENNETH AYCOCK, Commissioner, Department of Health and Environmental Control of State of South Carolina, Defendants. ORDER This is an action to restrain the def end ants (hereinafter re\u00ad f erred to as plaintiffs) procurement of a substance known variously as Laetrile, Arnygdalin, Prunasin or Vitamin B 17; to obtain civil, criminal and ethical immunity for physicians, nurses and technicians, who would handle and administer this substance ; and for a Rule to Show Cause why plaintiffs should not be allowed to procure the sub- '1 The intervenors were made parties to the action by this Court's Order of October 19, 1976. 6a stance and place it in the hands of a licensed physician. The remaining defendants 2 have moved for dismissal of the action and for summary judgment on the grounds that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction of the action, because plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administra\u00ad tive remedies, and even if there is jurisdiction, the plain\u00ad tiffs have not and cannot meet the burden required of them to justify the injunctive relief requested. The matter was heard by the Court on October 19, 1976 subsequent to its issuance of a Rule to Show Cause why plaintiffs should not be granted the relief requested in their motion for an immediate hearing. 3 Since this is essentially a proceeding for a preliminary injunction, the provisions of Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure dictate that the Court make the following FINDINGS OF FACT 1. Amygdalin is the chemical name for Laetrile, a sub\u00ad stance which occurs naturally in the kernels of apricots, peaches, bitter almonds and in other plant materials. It is a member of a class of substances known as cyanogenic glycosides. Laetrile or amygdalin is also commonly re\u00ad f erred to as \"Vitamin B-17\" although any nutritional value it might have as a vitamin has not been established. 2. There is not currently on file nor has there ever been on file with the Food and Drug Administration an 2 The defendant Aycock, Commissioner of South Carolina Depart\u00ad ment of Health and Environmental Control was dismissed from the case with plaintiffs' agreement on his motion for judgment on the pleadings. 3 Plaintiffs moved for an immediate hearing stating inter alia, as grounds the gravity of plaintiff, Julian H. Morgan, Sr.'s condition and asking for essentially the same relief prayed for in their com\u00ad plaint, in particular a preliminary injunction to prevent the ICC and the Customs Department from interferring with plaintiffs' transportation of a temporary supply of Laetrile. 7a approved new drug application (NDA) permitting the distribution in interstate commerce of amygdalin for ad\u00ad ministration into the human body. 3. There is not currently on file with the Food and Drug Administration a Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption (IND) permitting the investigational use of amygdalin in humans. An IND application was last made in 1970 by McNaughton Foundations of California which application was found inadequate and terminated shortly after it was received. 4. The plaintiff, Julian H. Morgan, Sr., was suffering from the advanced stages of cancer of the prostate and had from time to time used the substance in question, Laetrile, in an attempt to treat this disease and to miti\u00adgate its effects. On October 26, 1976, he died of the disease. The intervenor, Broadus Allison, is afflicted with cancer and seeks to use Laetrile to mitigate its effects. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW Initially the defendants' challenge this court's subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies in that the drug has never been submitted to the Food and Drug Ad\u00ad ministration (FDA) for its approval and thus it has not had the opportunity to rule on the merits of such an application. In light of the Court's ruling on the pre\u00ad liminary injunction, it is not necessary at this time to consider this issue. In considering whether the Court should grant a pre\u00ad liminary injunction, the plaintiffs have the burden of showing: ( 1) the probability that the plaintiff will suc\u00ad ceed on the merits; (2) the threat of irreparable injury to the plaintiff should preliminary injunctive relief be de\u00ad nied; ( 3) the lack of injury to other parties should the injunction issue; and ( 4) the public interest will not be harmed by the granting of the preliminary relief sought. Sa Conservation Council of North Carolina v. Costanzo, 505 F. 2d 498, 502 (4th Cir. 1974); Long v. Robinson, 432 F. 2d 977, 979 (4th Cir. 1970). The plaintiffs have not met their burden with regard to these factors. First, and most significantly, they have failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; spe\u00ad cifically, that Laetrile is not a \"drug'' within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321 (g) (1) which defines it to be an article \" ... intended for use in the diagnosis cure, miti\u00ad gation, treatment or prevention of disease in man .... \" It is the intended use of substance which determines whether or not it is a \"drug\". Hanson v. United States, 417 F. Supp. 30, 34 (D. Minn. 1976), aff'd Hanson v. United States, No. 76-1156 (8th Cir. August 26, 1976). The evidence presented here indicates that Laetrile was intended to be used to treat the plaintiffs for cancer and to mitigate its effects. Accordingly, there is little likeli\u00ad hood of success on this issue. Furthermore, plaintiffs have not shown a substantial likelihood of success with respect to whether Laetrile is a \"new drug'' within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321 (p) (1) which defines it as \"any drug ... the composition of which is such that such drug is not generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effec\u00ad tiveness of drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed .... \" Plaintiffs have not shown a substantial likelihood of success in establishing that Laetrile is generally recognized as safe and effective by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs. To the contrary, the defendants have presented sub\u00ad stantial evidence, by affidavit and at the hearing, which shows that Laetrile is not generally regarded as safe and effective for use in the treatment of cancer.4 Any 4 Plaintiffs' own expert witness testified that it could not be said that Laetrile was generally recognized as safe and effective for 9a drug that is not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended use is a new drug and cannot be shipped in interstate commerce until the information required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 (b) is submitted for approval to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the form of a New Drug Application estab\u00ad lishing that adequate and well controlled investigations have been performed to show that the drug is safe and effective, and the application is approved, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355. Here no NDA is or was in effect with respect to Laetrile.'5 See Finding of Fact 2, supra. use in the treatment of cancer; rather, it was recognized by a few. The defendants' expert testified that Laetrile was not recognized by those qualified by training and experience to be safe and effective for use in the treatment of cancer. This is. supported by the affi\u00ad davits submitted by the defendants. See Affidavit of Robert C. Eyerly, M.D. at 3; Affidavit of Vincent T. De Vita, Jr., M.D. at 4; Affidavit of George J. Hill, II, M.D. at 4; Affidavit of Carl M. Leventhal, M.D. at 3. 5 Plaintiffs apparently contend that the burden is on the FDA to approve or disapprove of a new drug in the first instance, since they complain that the FDA \"has failed, without adequate explanation, to approve Laetrile for distribution and use in the United States . . . . \" The language and the history of the Act demonstrate that it is not the responsibility o.f the FDA to initiate applications on its own in the absence of an application that conforms with the statu\u00ad tory requirements of \u00a7 505(a) and (b). No such application has been filed here. See Finding of Fact 2, supra. The FDA has been given the responsibility of \"approving applica\u00ad tions\". Therefore, it is apparent that they must be submitted for approval. This conclusion conforms with the Act's legislative history. The House Committee Report in discussion \u00a7 505 during its initial drafting in 1938 stated that This provision will not put the Federal Government into the business of developing new drugs, nor will it require the Govern\u00ad ment to duplicate laboratory and clinical tests made by respon\u00ad sible manufacturers. The provision merely sets up, a method for the authoritative review of the manufacturer's tests and will not unreasonably delay the introduction of new drugs in the market. H.R. Rep. No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess. (April 14, 1938), p. 9. Further discussion was had as to this section in the House Report 10a The facts indicate that the administrative process has not been followed and since this would likely preclude an award of relief at the end of the litigation, the plain\u00ad tiffs have not made a sufficient showing of the probability of ultimate success on the merits to obtain a preliminary injunction. Wallace v. Lynn, 507 F.2d 1186, 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1974). It has not been shown that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not forthcoming. The only evidence presented to this Court of any benefit Laetrile might provide in the treatment of cancer is that in some instances individuals taking it \"seem to experi\u00ad ence diminishing pain and an increase in appetite, weight gain, and psychological improvement.\" Affidavit of Ray\u00ad mond Hilliard, M.D.6 This is consistent with the effect a placebo would produce. The record is devoid of any evi\u00addence that Laetrile cures or halts the progress of cancer. Thus it does not follow that the enforcement of a law which denies Laetrile to a victim of cancer will cause him to suffer irreparable harm. Finally, it has not been shown that the granting of injunctive relief in this case would not injure other parties or the public. To the contrary, to permit the distribution of Laetrile in this case would be to circumvent the laws enacted to assure that drugs distributed in interstate com\u00ad merce be both safe and effective for their recommended use, and would undermine the ability of those charged of the 1962, amended version, which indicates that application was to be made by the manufacturer: Section 505 o,f the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act prohibits interstate shipment of a \"new drug\" . . . unless it is first cleared for safety through the filing of a new drug application by the manufacturer. H.R. Rep. No. 2464, 87th Con., 2d Sess. (Sept. 22, 1962), p. 3. 6 Testimony to this effect was also given at the hearing by Dr. Hilliard and by the plaintiff Julian H. Morgan, Jr. Ila with upholding these laws to do so most effectively in the future. Such a holding would also provide any future proponent of unproven remedies a basis for arguing to another court that it should allow the distribution of substances in a manner contrary to the law. This Court is not unmindful of the gravity of the situation facing those who are afflicted with cancer and of their desire to choose their own remedies in view of the absence of any known cure for this disease. However, granting the relief requested in this case could not only harm the public by weakening laws calculated to prevent the victimization of those afflicted with cancer and other conditions by playing on their desperation in the market\u00ad ing of unproven and, possibly worthless remedies, but it could also further the growing tendency of those afflicted with this disease to engage in self treatment resulting in a delay in seeking eary diagnosis and prompt treatment with forms of therapy that have established value. The result of this type of delay could be disastrous, since early diagnosis and treatment is of the utmost importance in the management of cancer. 1 7 This is support by most of the affidavits before the Court. See Affidavit of Robert C. Eyerly, M.D. at 3-4; Affidavit of Carl M. Leventhal, M.D. at 4. [P] roponents of Laetrile have advanced the argument that patients should be able to exercise free choice and select the drug if they wish to try it, despite a lack of scientific evidence of effectiveness. The idea that patients are able to make effec\u00ad tive choices concerning cancer management without regard to existing evidence is dangerously misleading. Cancer manage~ ment is a complex and demanding medical problem that depends upon availability of skilled trained physicians, surgeons, and other health professionals, and upon availability and use of drugs and other forms of therapy with defined and documented value. Availability and use of drugs which have not been found to have objective value makes no contribution to cancer man\u00ad agement. It can, in fact, interfere with the very measures that are known to save lives by delaying diagnosis and effective treatment. The consequences of such delay may be needless and untimely death. Affidavit of George J. Hill, II, M.D. at 3. 12a Accordingly, plaintiffs' prayer for preliminary injunc\u00ad tive relief is denied. AND IT SO ORDERED. November 30, 1976 Greenville, S.C. ROBERT F.

CUSTODY OF A MINOR ORDER The attorney for the child and the Attorney General have petitioned this Court to hold the parents in civil contempt as a result of the actions of the parents in re\u00ad moving the child from the Commonwealth of Massachu\u00ad setts. Based on the stipulated evidence that the parents have in fact removed the child from the Commonwealth, and based on the fact that the parents are represented at this hearing by counsel, I find the parents to be in civil contempt of court for their violation of the Order that was entered on April 18, 1978 and that was in\u00ad corporated into the Order entered on January 22, 1979, which directed that the child be treated by any board certified pediatric hematologist within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I continue the hearing to Wednesday, February 7, 1979, to permit the parents to cure the contempt. The Court wishes to emphasize the ability of the par\u00ad ents to purge themselves of this contempt and thereby to avoid being subject to any penalty by returning the child to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and com\u00ad plying fully thereafter with the Court's orders. The Court has accepted into evidence today a new lab\u00ad oratory test which indicates a level of free cyanide in the child's blood at twice the normal level. In light of this 20a new evidence of chronic cyanide toxicity, and in light of the Court's belief that the parents share the Court's deep concern for the safety and well-being of the child, I would hope and expect that the parents will appreciate the medical and legal advisability of returning the child to the skilled supervision of a Massachusetts medical center-both to avoid being penalized for their contempt and to maximize the child's chances of being cured. /s/ Guy Volterra Dated: January 31, 1979 GUY VOLTERRA, DCJ (Sitting by Statutory Designation) 21a COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS SUPERIOR COURT Civil Action No. 78-6816 PLYMOUTH, SS. CUSTODY OF A MINOR INTERLOCUTORY ORDER As the Court finds, after extensive hearing, that the parents have been administering to the minor child an unapproved drug, Amygdalin (Laetrile), which is dan\u00ad gerous to health, and that the parents have also been giving the minor child without medical supervision and prescription megadoseages of Vitamins A and C, mineral supplements, enzymes, folic acid, and calcium lactate, and as the Court further finds that the administering of these substances and drugs has been against the spe\u00ad cific advice of the treating physician; the Court finds that the conduct of the parents in administering these sub\u00ad stances to the minor child is harmful to the health of the child and may be counter-productive to the medical treatment the child is currently receiving for acute lymphocytic leukemic. The Court, until entry of a Final Order, issues the following Interlocutory Order: 1. The Order of this Court for Care and Protection dated April 18, 1978 is hereby continued in force; and 2. The parents are hereby ordered to cease adminis\u00ad tering to the minor Amygdalin ( also known as Laetrile, Vitamin B-17, Kemdalin, and other trade names) by tablet or injection to the minor; and 3. The parents are hereby ordered to cease admin\u00ad istering to the minor Vitamin A and Vitamin C in any form and in any amounts except that which the minor 22a child may ingest from the diet recommended by the treating physicians; and 4. The parents are hereby ordered to cease adminis\u00ad tering to the minor enzyme enemas; and 5. The parents are hereby ordered to cease adminis\u00ad tering to the minor any mineral supplements, enzymes, folic acid, or calcium lactate unless the administration of such substances is first approved by the treating phy\u00ad sician; and 6. The parents are ordered to submit the minor to such urine thiocyanate and serum thiocyanate tests as are ordered by the treating psysician. The treating phy\u00ad sician shall report to the Court any test results which indicate to him that the child remains at risk of chronic cyanide poisoning; and 7. The parents are ordered to submit the minor to such Vati_min A and liver function tests including SGOT, as are ordered by the treating physician to test for hypervitaminosis A and liver functions. The treating physician shall report to the Court any test results which indicate to him that the child remains at risk of hyper\u00ad vitaminosis A and impaired liver function. 8. The parents are to obtain from the treating phy\u00ad sician a recommended diet prepared by a dietician which is nutritionally sound and which is to reflect the parents stated preference for natural foods which are free from additives and preservatives.

COMPLAINT FOR FORFEITURE To The Honorable Judge of the United States District Court For The District of Maryland. Now comes the United States of America by Jervis S. Finney, United States Attorney for the District of Mary\u00ad land, and shows to the Court : 24a 1. That this complaint is filed by the United States of America, and prays seizure and condemnation of cer\u00ad tain articles of drug, as hereinafter set forth, in accord\u00ad ance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.). 2. That this Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1345 and 21 U.S.C. 334. 3. That there are at Baltimore, Maryland, in the pos\u00ad session of Henderson's Pharmacy, 7401 Harford Road, and Robert W. Henderson, 5 Weyburn Court, Baltimore, Maryland, or elsewhere within the jurisdiction of this Court, the articles of _drug hereinabove de:;;cribed in the caption of this matter, which articles were shipped in interstate commerce on or about July 12, 1977 (47 bottle (vial) and 23 box lots) and on or about July 21, 1977 (45 bottle (vial) and 25 box lots) , by Cyto Pharma, from Tijuana, Mexico into California via known carriers; and subsequently delivered to Robert W. Henderson in Balti\u00admore, Maryland. 4. That the aforesaid articles are new drugs within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 321 (p) ( 1), which may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 355 (a), since no ap\u00ad proval of an application filed pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 355 (b) is effective with respect to such drugs; no notice of claimed investigational exemption pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 355 (i) and regulation 21 CFR 312.1 is on file for such drugs; and the drugs are not exempt from the require\u00ad ments of the new drug provisions of said act, 21 U.S.C. 355, pursuant to the order of the Court in Rutherford v. United States, 429 F. Supp. 506 (W.D. Okla., 1977), since the articles were offered for importation into the United States solely for the personal use and benefit of persons who executed affidavits required by the Court in Rutherford and are intended for distribution to per-25a sons other than those for whose benefit the articles were imported. 5. That the aforesaid articles were adulterated when introduced into and while in interstate commerce, within the meaning of said Act, 21 U.S.C. 351 (a) (2) (B) in that they are drugs and the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, their manufacture, pro\u00adcessing, packing, and holding did not conform to and were not operated and administered in conformity with current good manufacturing practice, as set forth in reg\u00ad ulations 21 CFR 211, to assure that such drugs meet the requirements of said Act as to safety and have the strength and meet the quality and purity characteristics which they purport and are represented to possess. 6. That the aforesaid article (47 bottle (vial) lot) was adulterated when introduced into, while in, and while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce, within the meaning of said Act, 21 U.S.C. 351 (c), in that it is a drug not subject to the provisions of 21 U.S.C. 351 (b) and its strength differs from that which it pur\u00ad ports and is represented to possess, because it contains less than 500 milligrams of amygdalin. 7. That the aforesaid articles were misbranded, when introduced into, while in, and while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce, within the meaning of said Act, 21 U.S.C. 352 (j), in that Amigdalina (amyg\u00ad dalin) tablets are dangerous to health when used in the manner, and with the frequency and duration prescribed, recommended and suggested in the labeling thereof, that is, when used orally and with the frequency and dura\u00ad tion prescribed in affidavits which are accompanying labeling for the tablets. 8. That by reason of the fore going, the aforesaid ar\u00ad ticles are held illegally within the jurisdiction of this Court, and are liable to seizure and condemnation. 26a WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays that process in due form of law according to the course of this Court in cases of actions in rem issue against the aforesaid ar\u00ad ticles; that all persons having any interest therein be cited to appear herein and answer the aforesaid prem\u00ad ises; that this Court decree the condemnation of the aforesaid articles and grant plaintiff the costs of this proceeding against the claimant of the aforesaid articles; that the aforesaid articles be disposed of as this Court may direct pursuant to the provisions of said Act; and that plaintiff have such other and further relief as the case may require.

MOTION FOR PARTIAL RELEASE OF SEIZED GOODS AND SUPERVISED DELIVERY TO CERTAIN PATIENTS Now comes the United States of America, plaintiff herein, and moves this Honorable Court for release of certain ampoules and tablets of the drug Laetrile, as hereinafter specified, which were seized by the United States Marshal on August 5, 1977 pursuant to motion of 28a the Court. The order prayed for seeks release from the United States Marshal of limited amounts of the drug for redelivery to Robert Henderson, R.Ph., 7401 Harford Road, Baltimore, Maryland, in order that Mr. Henderson, under supervision of authorized agents of the United States Food and Drug Administration, cause to be de\u00ad livered to patients entitled to receive Laetrile the amount of said drug they ordered. As grounds for this motion plaintiff states that: 1. Pursuant to procedures authorized by the Court in Rutherford v. United States, 429 F. Supp. 506 (W.D. Okla., 1977), persons diagnosed as suffering from termi\u00ad nal cancer may import for their personal use only a limited amount of Laetrile not to exceed 750 tablets and 150 10cc ampoules. As a condition precedent to importa\u00ad tion the patient or his duly authorized agent must present to the United States Customs Service an affidavit of a physician certifying the patient's condition and specifying the amount of Laetrile ordered. 2. On July 12, 1977 affidavits for 16 patients were presented to customs officials to justify importation of 2,380 ampoules and 11,950 tablets of Laetrile. These ar\u00ad ticles were thereafter shipped to Robert Henderson. 3. On July 21, 1977 affidavits for 17 patients were presented to customs officials to justify importation of 2,450 ampoules and 11,150 tablets of Laetrile. These ar\u00ad ticles were thereafter shipped to Robert Henderson. 4. As agent for the persons named in the affidavits, Mr. Henderson was authorized to deliver to these persons the amounts of Laetrile imported on their behalf and for their personal use. 5. Investigations by United States Food and Drug Administration investigators have revealed that the af\u00ad fidavits are fraudulent in that patients on whose behalf affidavits were presented to customs officials either or-29a dered significantly less than the amount of Laetrile de\u00ad clared on the affidavits or did not order any Laetrile whatsoever and are unaware of any affidavit being exe\u00ad cuted on their behalf. 6. Food and Drug Administration investigations fur\u00ad ther reveal that Mr. Henderson has solicited abandonment of Laetrile from patients who ordered Laetrile and on whose behalf affidavits were presented to customs officials and that either as a result of such solicitations or for other reasons, some patients have cancelled or reduced their orders for Laetrile. 7. Food and Drug Administration investigations fur\u00ad ther reveal that affidavits presented to customs officials contain false information in that th~ amounts of Laetrile represented to have been ordered by the patients exceeds the amounts actually ordered and that Mr. Henderson uses these amounts of Laetrile not ordered by patients to create a stockpile from which he then sells to other persons who have not executed affidavits presented to Customs for purposes of facilitating importation of the drug for their use. 8. Patients on whose behalf Laetrile was lawfully im\u00ad ported into the United States pursuant to procedures prescribed in Rutherford v. United States, supra, have supplied FDA investigators with information concerning the amounts of Laetrile they ordered and still desire to be delivered to them. In the aggregate the total amount of Laetrile they ordered and desire to receive is 77 ampoules and 280 tablets. The Food and Drug Administration is in the process of contacting other patients to determine the amounts of Laetrile they ordered and still desire to obtain and will re\u00ad port promptly its finding to this Court. 80a Wherefore, the United States prays that the Court enter the attached proposed Order for Partial Release of Seized Goods and Supervised Delivery to Certain Parties.
