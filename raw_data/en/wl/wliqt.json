Some of them are explained below. Conventional Medicine We believe that conventional medicine has much to offer patients when used prudently and wisely. In combination with other proven modalities, it can be a powerful tool in healing many ailments. Functional Medicine Functional medicine is a systems biology-based approach that focuses on identifying and addressing the root cause of disease. This field of medicine looks at the human body from cellular to organ levels and involves the study of fundamental biological processes which cuts through organ systems and medical specialties. Natural Medicine Supplements, nutrients, and vitamins play an important role in fighting illnesses and keeping us healthy. By focusing on proven natural remedies, which also includes diet and lifestyle changes, we can help the body's vital ability to heal and maintain itself. Mind-Body Medicine Stress is a major culprit in many ailments and our state of mind has a great impact on how our body responds to stress. A well-adjusted mind-body utilizes relaxation response as a healthy way of dealing with daily stress. The body's natural relaxation response can be triggered using breathing techniques, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery. Through workshops and private consultations, we will address stress and ways of dealing with stress. Other Useful Approaches Other methods that can be utilized in the integrative approach may include acupuncture, aromatherapy, ayurvedic medicine, homeopathy, massage, and chiropractic care, etc. Diagnostic Testing In addition to a detailed history and physical exam, we employ cutting edge, advanced laboratory testing to help us diagnose and treat your child's illness. We offer detailed testing of your child's hormonal, digestive and immune systems as well as your child's current burden of main toxins and infections.
