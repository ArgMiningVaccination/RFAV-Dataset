The Pfizer- BioNTech BNT162b2 was the first vaccine to be granted temporary authorization for emer - gency use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the U.K for the treatment of COVID- 19 on 2 December 2020.1 Soon a ft er , on 1 1 Dec ember 2020, it al so re - ceived emergency use authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).2 EUA is a mechanism to facilitate the availability of vaccines during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID- 19 pandemic. Under an EUA, the FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products (including vaccines) to prevent serious or life- threatening disease when certain stat - utory criteria have been met and no adequate and/or approved alternatives are available. The authorization of BNT162b2 was fol - lowed by an EUA for a second COVID- 19 vaccine, the Moderna mRNA- 1273 on 18 December 2020.3 T h i s w a s f o l l o w e d b y t h e authorization of mRNA- 1273 for use by other regulatory agencies such as the European Commission, UK MHRA, Israel Ministry of 23Department of Dermatology and Allergy Center, Odense Research Center for Anaphylaxis, Odense University Hospital, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark 24Department of Medicine and School of Microbiology, APC Microbiome Ireland, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland 25Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Chemistry, Complutense University, Madrid, Spain 26Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Section of Rhinology and Allergy, University Hospital Marburg, Philipps- Universit\u00e4t 27Department of Paediatrics, Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore 28Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, Barcelona, Spain 29Department of National Heart and Lung Institute, Immunomodulation and Tolerance Group, Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Imperial College London, London, UK 30Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma, London, UK 31Allergy Unit, Malaga Regional University Hospital- UMA- ARADyAL, M\u00e1laga, Spain 32Department of Environmental Medicine, Medical Faculty, University Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany 33Institute of Environmental Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany 34Department of Immunology and Pathology, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia 35Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology, Alfred Health, Melbourne, VIC, Australia 36Department of Otolaryngology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore 37Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Beijing TongRen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China Correspondence Kari C.

Email: knadeau@stanford.eduAbstract Vaccines are essential public health tools with a favorable safety profile and prophy - lactic effectiveness that have historically played significant roles in reducing infec - tious disease burden in populations, when the majority of individuals are vaccinated. The COVID- 19 vaccines are expected to have similar positive impacts on health across the globe. While serious allergic reactions to vaccines are rare, their under - lying mechanisms and implications for clinical management should be considered to provide individuals with the safest care possible. In this review, we provide an overview of different types of allergic adverse reactions that can potentially occur after vaccination and individual vaccine components capable of causing the allergic adverse reactions. We present the incidence of allergic adverse reactions during clinical studies and through post- authorization and post- marketing surveillance and provide plausible causes of these reactions based on potential allergenic compo - nents present in several common vaccines. Additionally, we review implications for individual diagnosis and management and vaccine manufacturing overall. Finally, we suggest areas for future research.

Health, and others.4 On December 30, a third COVID- 19 vaccine, the Oxford/AstraZeneca recombinant adenoviral AZD1222 or ChAdOx1- S was authorized for use by the UK MHRA.5 In addi - tion to the above authorized COVID- 19 vaccines, a number of other novel COVID- 19 vaccines are currently in different phases of clinicals development. Currently, used platforms in COVID- 19 vaccines include classical and novel platforms, such as RNA- and DNA- based, viral vectors (non- replicating), protein subunits, virus- like particles, and inactivated viral platform (Table 1).6 - 8 With the authorization of COVID- 19 vaccines, vaccination cam - paigns have been initiated in many areas throughout the world. Within the first few days of public vaccinations, however, BNT162b2 was associated with a few severe cases of anaphylaxis.9 While se - vere allergic reactions may pose a potential risk with any vaccine (or systemic medications), the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks of receiving the vaccine for the vast majority of indi - viduals. However, the fear of allergic reactions may lead to vaccine hesitancy, which could compromise herd immunity and limit efforts to contain the pandemic. It is therefore critical that we understand the immunopathological changes in COVID- 19,10 risk of severe aller - gic reactions, and their mechanisms in order to improve individual safety and issue proper guidance with the goal of vaccinating the maximum number of individuals. Here, we review adverse events associated with vaccine- related allergic and non- allergic reactions to COVID- 19 and other vaccines, mechanisms associated with allergic adverse reactions, and rates of severe allergic reactions with exist - ing vaccines and with the novel COVID- 19 active vaccines currently being administered to large parts of the world. 2|SECTION I: VACCINE- ASSOCIATED ALLERGIC VS NON- ALLERGIC REACTIONS There are a number of vaccines currently used with proven safety and efficacy. Vaccines are potentially associated with adverse events. An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence asso - ciated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.11 Adverse events can present as local or systemic, im - mediate or non- immediate, and immune or non- immune- mediated reactions. While all allergic reactions are immune- mediated, not all immune- mediated reactions are allergic. Local non- immediate reac - tions that are not allergenic are common and may include swelling and erythema at the injection site. These reactions can occur hours or days after administration and are not always mediated through the immune system. Systemic non- allergic reactions including mild fever and vasovagal reactions such as hypotension, nausea, and syn - cope are also relatively common. Neither the local nor the vasovagal reactions pose any serious risk. Although some of these reactions are immune- mediated, they are not allergic reactions. Rather, sore - ness at the injection site or fatigue are consequences of activation of the innate immune system.12- 15 As of 10 February 2021, 44.77 million people had taken one or two doses of a COVID vaccine in the United States. 653 deaths and 12,697 total adverse events had been reported to following COVID- 19 vaccinations to the CDC and Prevention's VAERS.16 Adverse events, including allergic reactions, are graded according to severity as mild, moderate, and for purposes of this review, se - rious. Typical signs of an allergic reaction include bronchoconstric - tion, conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea, gastrointestinal symptoms, and/ or characteristic skin lesions such as generalized urticaria and/or angioedema. These can occur in combination or alone, and onset can be immediate, within minutes, or up to several hours post- vaccination. Examples of mild allergic reactions are swelling with itching at the injection site, conjunctivitis, or rhinorrhea. Examples of moderate allergic reactions are bronchoconstriction that can be adequately treated with nebulized beta- agonists or generalized ur - ticaria that may be treated with an antihistamine. Serious adverse events (SAE) are those events that are life- threatening, require in - patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, cause a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption in the ability to conduct normal life functions, a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, or death. Two examples of SAE that are allergic reac - tions are bronchospasm that requires intensive treatment and life- threatening anaphylaxis.11,17 Anaphylaxis, an immediate systemic multi- organ reaction, is rare but can be life- threatening. Organs affected include the cu - taneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems. immunological, is diagnosed through exclu - sion of other known causes and may mask a clonal mast cell dis - order.1 8 - 2 3 Non- immunological anaphylaxis was previously termed anaphylactoid reactions, but the World Allergy Organization (WAO) in 2004 suggested replacing anaphylactoid reactions with non- immunological anaphylaxis.24 The change in terminology is to reinforce the risk and potential fatality of all types of anaphylaxis, regardless of the underlying mechanism. All three mechanisms of anaphylaxis produce the same clinical picture (see Section IV on mechanisms below). Distinguishing between systemic vasovagal re- actions and anaphylaxis during immunization is critical to ensure that appropriate and immediate treatment can be administered (Table 2). Vasovagal reactions usually occur immediately or up to 30 minutes of vaccine administration. Similar to anaphylaxis, organs affected in - clude the cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, neurological, and cardiovascular systems.25,26 Anaphylactic reactions are considered adverse events of special interest (AESI),27 that is, adverse events that are of significant medical and scientific concern for which immediate medical action with ongo - ing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator or sponsor is required. AESI reporting is a critical aspect of pharmacovigilance for characterization of the safety profile of a drug or vaccine in context of previous reports of the vaccine or of other vaccines with similar man - ufacturing processes, formulation, immunogenicity, and novelty. AESIs alert regulators to potential risks. Particularly in mass vaccination pro - grams where a large number of adverse reactions may be reported, identification and assessment of AESIs are a high priority because they highlight potential risks that may alter risk- benefit profile and | 1645 SAMPATH eT Al. may require immediate investigation, regulatory action, and prompt communication with the public.28,29 Table 3 lists Pharmacovigilance Practices that follow authorization of a vaccine. 3|SECTION II: ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO VACCINES In the last 120 years, global vaccination programs have eradicated or vastly reduced the incidence of debilitating infectious diseases such as smallpox, polio, and measles.30 According to the Institute of Medicine, epidemiologic and mechanistic evidence support a causal relationship between anaphylaxis and several vaccines, in - cluding those for measles, mumps, and rubella fluenza, hepatitis B, meningococcus, human papillomavirus, and the combined diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTaP or TdaP) vaccine.31 Although approved vaccines have been rigorously tested for safety, anaphylactic reactions, although rare, can occur in individuals.32 An analysis of reported anaphylaxis to the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS) in the United States over a 26- year period found that out of the almost 500,000 reports to VAERS, only 828 were classified as anaphylaxis based on either on physician's diagnosis or in according to the Brighton Collaboration case standards.33 A 2003 study analyzing over eight million routine vaccinations in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project34 found the risk of anaphylaxis ranged between 0.65 and 1.53 cases/million doses. They also noted that most anaphylactic episodes occurred when multiple vaccines were administered during the same visit.35 Similarly, a 2016 study used health data from VSD and found 33 confirmed cases of anaphylaxis after 25,173,965 vaccine doses or an anaphylaxis rate of 1.31 per million vaccine doses.36 The study also found that 85% of cases of anaphylaxis had pre- existing atopic disease, which was consistent with earlier reports emphasizing coexisting atopic disease, particu - larly asthma, as being clinical risk factors for anaphylaxis.37 In Asian children, analysis of a large- linked database found risk of anaphy - laxis to be 1.21 cases/million doses.38 A study conducted in Australia found that estimated incidence rate of anaphylaxis for DTaP vaccines was 0.36 cases per 100,000 doses, and 1.25 per 100,000 doses for MMR vaccines.39 Overall, rates of reported anaphylaxis occur at a rate of about 1 per 100,000 to one per 1,000,000 depending on the vaccine.40 Figure 1 and Table 4 show the frequency of anaphylaxis for specific vaccines. Table 5 provides population- specific consid - erations for common vaccines.41- 44 4|SECTION III: ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO COVID- 19 MRNA VACCINES Development of the SARS- CoV- 2 mRNA vaccine occurred in record time. So far, three candidate vaccines (mRNA BNT162b2, mRNA- 1273, and adenovirus vectored ChAdOx1) have been authorized for COVID- 19 in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Of these, mRNA BNT162b2 and mRNA- 1273 are authorized for emergency use in the United States. Additional candidates have entered or are Vasovagal Episode Anaphylaxis Onset Immediately or up to 30 minutes after vaccine administrationCan be immediate or within minutes or up to several hours after vaccine administration Respiratory Normal respiration - may be shallow, but not laboredCough, wheeze, stridor, hoarseness, rhinorrhea Signs of respiratory distress (tachypnea, cyanosis, and rib recession) Upper airway swelling (lip, throat, tongue, uvula, or larynx) Cardiovascular Bradycardia\u2014 weak/absent peripheral pulse- but with strong central pulse (carotid) Hypotension\u2014 usually transient and corrects in supine position Loss of consciousness\u2014 improves once supine or head- down positionTachycardia, weak/absent central pulse Hypotension\u2014 sustained and no improvement without specific treatment (in infants and young children, limpness and pallor are signs of hypotension) Loss of consciousness\u2014 no improvement once supine or in head- down position Skin Generalized pallor, cool clammy skin Urticaria, angioedema, pruritus, erythema Gastrointestinal Nausea or vomiting Abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting Neurological Nausea or vomiting Feels faint, light- headed, headache, dizziness blurred vision, restless, seldom: seizuresTABLE 2 Differentiating features of vasovagal episode vs. anaphylaxis25,261646 | SAMPATH eT Al. completing the pivotal stage of clinical development programs. At the time of this review, there are 64 vaccines in several stages of clinical development and 173 in pre- clinical development world - wide.45 Details of their composition, mode of action, and develop - mental stage can be found in the review by Rodriguez- Coira et al.46 Even after formal authorization, vaccine rollout in the United Kingdom, United States, and European Union has been and contin - ues to be challenging. Navigating complex distribution logistics, de - termining ethical allocation of a limited resource, and de- mystifying widespread news coverage of anaphylactic events that perpetuate vaccine hesitancy is among the most pressing. While anaphylaxis after routine vaccination is very rare, it is important for the scientific community to be informed and prepared to treat adverse vaccine reactions to increase safety and acceptability. During the COVID- 19 pandemic, vast quantities of vaccine are expected to be adminis - tered over a very short period of time, with increased public aware - ness and surveillance. In this situation, the probability of reporting anaphylaxis likely increases without the added context of the de - nominator, which is the millions of individuals receiving the vaccine. Of the vaccines authorized for use in Europe and the United States, the first vaccine to be administered and distributed was the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine in the UK. Following two reports of aller - gic reactions in the UK on 8 December 2020, the MHRA updated its guidelines to state that individuals should not receive the vaccine if they have had previous anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine, or food. In addition, MHRA recommended that individuals who experience anaphylaxis after their first dose of the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine should not receive the second dose and that everyone should be monitored for a minimum of 15 min after vaccination. However, on December 30, after a review of additional data, the guidelines were further updated to indicate that anyone with a previous history of allergic reactions to the ingredients of the vaccine should not re - ceive it, but those with any other allergies such as a food allergy can receive the vaccine.47 A CDC report of the VAERS monitoring database indicates that between 14 December 2020 and 23 December 2020, 1,893,360 first doses of the mRNA BNT162b2 COVID- 19 vaccine were ad - ministered, and 21 cases of anaphylaxis were reported (11.1 cases per million doses). Seventy- one percent of these reactions occurred within 15 minutes of vaccination.48 Similarly, the CDC reported that between 21 December 2020 and 10 January 2021, 10 cases of anaphylaxis were reported after administration of 4,041,396 first doses of the mRNA- 1273 vaccine (2.5 cases per million doses administered). In nine cases, onset occurred within 15 minutes of vaccination. No anaphylaxis- related deaths were reported.49 This suggests that the incidence of anaphylaxis in the mRNA BNT162b2 (11.1 cases per million doses) and mRNA- 1273 COVID- 19 vaccines (2.5 cases per million doses) may be about 2 to 8.5 times as high as the incidence reported in the 2016 VSD study for all vaccines (1.31 per million doses). The US FDA authorized labeling currently lists past severe allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine as a contraindication to the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine.

Yet, the CDC also recommends that individuals with a history of im - mediate allergic reactions to other vaccines weigh their risk of expo - sure, risk of severe disease or death due to COVID- 19, and consider whether they were previously infected with COVID- 19 (because of lower rates of reinfection in the three- month period after infection), when deciding whether to delay or forego vaccination.50,51 After the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine received central European marketing approval on 21 December 2020, the Paul- Ehrlich- Institut, Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines in Germany, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released its own guidance for vaccination of people with allergies. These guidelines recommended that only individuals in the European Union with an allergy to a spe - cific vaccine component not receive the vaccine.52 The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) position paper on diagnosis, management, and prevention of severe allergic reac - tions to the COVID- 19 vaccines states that the vaccines are con - traindicated only when there is an allergy to one of the vaccine components or if there was a severe allergic reaction to the first dose. The paper also provides a simplified algorithm of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of severe allergic reactions and a list of rec - ommended medications and equipment for vaccine centers.53 5|SECTION IV: GENERAL MECHANISMS IN PATHWAYS MEDIATED sitivity reaction type 1),54 IgG- mediated (hypersensitivity reaction type 2), immune complex and/or complement- mediated (hypersen - sitivity reaction type 3), or cell- mediated (hypersensitivity reaction type 4) (Figure 2).55 The mechanisms underlying IgE- mediated hyper - sensitivity are best understood. Individuals with IgE- mediated aller - gic reactions first undergo an initial sensitization phase during which allergen- specific IgE antibodies bind to high- affinity Fc RI recep - tors on mast cells and basophils. Subsequent allergen exposure can cross- link the cell- bound IgE antibodies and triggers degranulation of mast cells and/or basophils, with subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleu - kins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous se - cretion, tissue eosinophilic infiltration, and airway smooth muscle contraction.56 Type II IgG- mediated immune vaccine reactions are rare but have been observed with an MMR vaccine containing dextran before those preparations were taken off the market.57 The occurrence of large, local injection- site reactions with TdaP vaccines has been reported to be due to a local immune complex type III hypersensi - tivity reaction.58 Type IV hypersensitivity reactions occur when an individual's T cells provoke an inflammatory response against aller - gens, leading to T- cell activation and the release of cytokines and chemokines.59 T ype IV reactions to vaccines induce local eczema, which may start between 2 hours to up to 2 days after vaccinations. These reactions are typically observed following vaccines contain - ing aluminum and antimicrobial agents. The occurrence of such an event is not a contraindication for further vaccinations.60 Non- immunologic anaphylaxis is caused by agents or events that induce sudden, massive mast cell and/or basophil degranulation in the absence of immunoglobulins. These reactions may be due to activation of complement by nanoparticles, colloidal solutions, or liposomes without immune complex formation, commonly termed complement activation- related pseudoallergy or CARPAs61 (eg, med - ications containing Cremophor EL62), direct mast cell and basophil activation resulting in histamine release (vancomycin63 and opiate medications61), antibodies, and chemotherapeutic agents have also been reported to induce non- immunologic ana - phylaxis. Recently, transient receptor potential cation receptor, subfamily V (TRPV4) channel has been implicated as a driver of IgE- independent mast cell- dependent bronchospasm via cysteinyl addition, MRGPRX2, a Mas- related G protein- coupled receptor, has been identified as a mechanism for mast cell degranulation.

Here, we discuss some of the most common allergenic or potentially allergenic components of vaccines. Many vaccines contain small amounts of the egg protein ov - albumin. Influenza, yellow fever, and rabies vaccines tend to have higher concentrations of ovalbumin because they are cultured in embryonated chicken eggs.85 Vaccines cultured in chicken embryo fibroblasts, such as the MMR vaccine, have lower concentrations of egg protein than those cultured in embryonic eggs.86 While egg allergy is common in childhood, studies have shown that vaccinat - ing egg- allergic children with MMR and influenza vaccines is well tolerated and risk of an allergic reaction is similar in the general population.87,88 Specifically, egg- allergic children, including those who have had anaphylaxis, were successfully vaccinated with yellow fever89 vaccines with no serious adverse events reported. Since se - vere allergic reactions to egg- based influenza vaccines are rare, the CDC and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines state that individuals with mild egg allergy can receive any licensed and recommended age- appropriate flu vaccine and no longer need to be observed for 30 minutes after receiving the vac - cine. However, in those with severe egg allergy, the vaccines should only be given under the supervision of a health care provider who is capable of recognizing and managing serious allergic conditions.90,91FIGURE 2Types of hypersensitivity reactions 1650 | SAMPATH eT Al. Gelatin, a protein derived from bovine or porcine sources, is added to both live and inactivated vaccines as a stabilizing agent.60 Sensitivity to gelatin was confirmed with both skin- prick tests and by immunoassay in a 17- year- old female who had an anaphylac - tic reaction to an MMR vaccine.92 A retrospective case- control study which interviewed and collected sera from individuals who had suffered anaphylaxis after receiving MMR found that 27% of them had anti- gelatin IgE. In comparison, anti- gelatin IgE was not detected in any of the vaccinated subjects who did not present with adverse events.93 I t w a s s u b s e q u e n t l y s h o w n t h a t p a t i e n ts who have anaphylaxis to MMR were sensitized to gelatin pres - ent in the DTaP vaccine,94,95 and that cellular immunity to gelatin from the DTaP vaccine can persist for more than three years.96 However, sensitization may also persist due to exposure to gelatin in foods or through cross- reactivity to other allergens such as egg, chicken, and cow's milk.97 Gelatin is also a source of alpha- gal, an carbohydrate allergen that causes meat allergy.98 Anaphylaxis was observed after vaccination with MMR, Varicella, and DTaP/IPV in pediatric subjects with alpha- gal allergy.99 R e m o v a l o f g e l a t i n from vaccines has dramatically reduced allergic reactions to these vaccines.100 Milk proteins are used as growth media in DTaP and Tdap vac - cines. Although bovine casein is present in nanogram quantities in these vaccines, they rarely cause anaphylaxis. Kattan et al reported eight children with severe cow's milk allergy who reacted with ana - phylaxis to the booster dose of DTaP or Tdap vaccine and suggested casein present in the vaccines may play role in the induction of anaphylaxis in atopic children.101,102 However, the methods used in this report were questioned102 and to our knowledge, there have been no subsequent data that support a causative role for DTaP or Tdap vaccines in the induction of allergic disease. It is the position of EAACI (or subcommittee) that these vaccines do not contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic disease and that atopy is not a contrain - dication to anaphylaxis | 1651 SAMPATH eT Al.

It is a potential contaminant.1652 | SAMPATH eT Al. As stated above, dextran present in one preparation of MMR vaccine was responsible for numerous cases of anaphylaxis, but this brand of MMR vaccine has since been withdrawn from the mar - ket.103 It was used as a medium nutrient or as a stabilizer. Similarly, during Brazil's national MMR vaccination campaign in 2004, the rate of hypersensitivity following MMR vaccination was unexpect - edly high while its case- control study showed no association with a history of allergy. However, subsequent studies implicated dextran as the likely cause of these hypersensitivity events.104 Many vaccines contain antigens that are created in cell lines. For example, hepatitis B vaccines and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines contain antigens that are recombinant proteins expressed in Baker's yeast.105 Purification removes most of the cellular mate - rial, but it is impossible to remove all trace components. Between 1990 and 2004, only 15 reports were identified of probable or pos - sible anaphylaxis following vaccination of individuals with a reported history of yeast allergy. Eleven of these occurred after administra - tion of the hepatitis B vaccine, which contains trace amounts of yeast proteins. Because these subjects were not tested for yeast allergy, it cannot be confirmed that sensitivity to yeast caused these adverse reactions. These data indicate that recombinant yeast- derived hepatitis B vaccine poses minimal risk of allergic reactions in yeast- sensitive individuals. Therefore, evaluation by an allergist is recommended for people who have a history of severe yeast allergy before administration of hepatitis B and HPV vaccines.105 According to VAERS, there were 107 reports of adverse events in those with a history of yeast allergy present prior to vaccination; of these 11 re - cipients of hepatitis B vaccine had probable or possible anaphylaxis events.105 By contrast, another study found no episodes of anaphy - laxis in a large cohort of women who had positive skin tests to yeast extract after the HPV vaccine.106 Antibiotics such as neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B, ka - namycin, and gentamicin are well known to cause mild to life- threatening allergic reactions. An individual receiving an MMR vaccine containing neomycin was reported to have experienced anaphylaxis shortly after vaccination.107 Although a skin test to neomycin alone could not be performed in this individual due to a lack of a commercial preparation suitable for skin testing, patient history indicated systemic sensitivity on topical application of neo- mycin during infancy to disrupted skin. In another case, a history of previous reaction and positive skin test to neomycin was not associ - ated with immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reactions following MMR vaccination.108 In a report of anaphylaxis after rabies vaccina - tion, the presence of residual kanamycin in the vaccine and a posi - tive kanamycin result to an antibiotic skin sensitivity test suggested that kanamycin was the likely cause of the adverse event.109 Finally, there is one report of anaphylaxis after applying eye drops contain - ing polymyxin B, an excipient used in DTaP and other vaccines.43,110 To our knowledge, no other antibiotics have been associated with vaccine- associated anaphylaxis. 2- Phenoxyethanol is widely used as preservative in cosmetics and vaccines due to its large spectrum of antimicrobial activity and is considered as one of the most well- tolerated preservatives.111Natural latex allergy is well characterized among healthcare personnel and latex content in vaccines as vial stopper or syringe plunger may pose safety concerns in this population. However, Smith et al could not detect latex allergens in adult vaccines.112 In 2004, an analysis of VAERS revealed only 28 cases of immediate hy - persensitivity with latex allergy in vaccine recipients among 160,000 reports of vaccine- associated adverse events.113 Thimerosal, which is approximately 50% mercury by weight, has been one of the most widely used preservatives in vaccines to prevent growth of harmful microbes. All vaccines routinely recom - mended for children 6 years of age and younger in the United States are available in formulations that do not contain thimerosal.114 A risk assessment study revealed that except for local hypersensitivity re - actions, there is no evidence of harm caused by thimerosal in vac - cines.115 Thus, while thimerosal is the most prevalent preservative inducing contact dermatitis, it is considered irrelevant to vaccine- induced anaphylaxis.116 Formaldehyde and beta- propiolactone (BPL) have been used to inactivate viruses during the production of vaccines. However, approximately 6% of individuals who receive a booster dose of the rabies human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) develop an immune complex- like reaction in the 2- 21 days that follow.117,118 These reac - tions have been associated with the presence of BPL altered human albumin contained in the inactivate SARS- CoV- 2. Both vaccines are approved for use in China. Although formaldehyde is only found in residual quantities in vaccine preparation, it has been reported to aggravate eczematous dermatitis following hepatitis B vaccina - tion.123 It is used to inactivate virus or for the detoxification of bac - terial toxin. Formaldehyde- specific contact dermatitis had also been reported following formaldehyde- containing influenza vaccine.124 It is hypothesized that the introduction of carbonyl groups on antigens by formaldehyde in vaccines profoundly affects its immunogenic - ity, thus explaining adverse effects due to formaldehyde- containing vaccines.125,126 Adjuvants are incorporated into some vaccines to boost T- cell immunity and increase helper T- cell function. The most commonly used adjuvants in vaccines are aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate. Despite its long- standing use as an adjuvant in vaccines, aluminum has always been the target of controversy. Although no association between direct toxicity of aluminum and vaccines has been established, several delayed- type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.127- 129 In Denmark, 39 out of 4 2 children with persistent skin reactions following vaccination had positive patch tests for aluminum.130 In another study, vaccination- induced granu - lomas and contact allergy to aluminum was reported in 60 out of 63 Swedish children receiving DTP vaccines.131 In c on tra st, an in viv o study in a mouse model of peanut allergy found that the severity of peanut- hypersensitivity was reduced by an alum/CpG- adjuvanted vaccine while exposure to endotoxin and alum did not influence al - lergic symptoms.132 O t h e r n o v e l a d j u v a n t s s u c h a s M F 5 9 , A S 0 3 , and AF03, which are squalene- based are also used in vaccines.133 | 1653 SAMPATH eT Al. Although safety concerns were raised due to presence of antibod - ies to squalene, clinical evidence clearly suggested that squalene is poorly immunogenic and that low titers of antibodies to squalene are found in healthy individuals. Further, neither the presence of anti- squalene antibodies nor their titer is significantly increased by immunization with vaccines containing squalene.134 D e t a i l s o n t h e mechanism of these and other vaccine adjuvants under clinical inves - tigation are detailed in the review by Shi et al.135 Polysorbate 80 is an emulsifier which has been widely used to solubilize agents in foods and medicines, including vaccines. This nonionic detergent induces local and systemic allergic reactions, in - cluding IgE- mediated and non- immune anaphylaxis. The hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) is structurally similar to polysor - bate 80 and PEG, and its derivatives are frequently found in house - hold products including toothpaste, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods. In addition, PEG is often conjugated to biological therapeu - tics to form a depot agent. It is now well understood that sensitivity to PEG can cause IgE- mediated anaphylaxis after administration of PEG- conjugated biological therapeutics,1 3 6 - 1 4 1 a n d t h a t s e v e r e a l - lergic reactions to PEG have been associated with pre- existing anti- PEG antibodies induced by PEG- containing household products.142 Polysorbate 80 is present in many vaccines and some foods as well. Polysorbates are obtained from PEG moieties but have lower molec - ular weights and thus may be much less likely to trigger an allergic reaction. PEG may also be cross- reactive with polysorbates, which are contained in some COVID- 19 vaccines.141,143- 145 However, mea - sures of pre- existing anti- PEG antibodies vary widely, range from 0.2% to 72% of healthy individuals.146 This has become immediately relevant because PEG 2000, a high- molecular weight version of PEG, is a component in two of the three authorized COVID- 19 vaccines. The mRNA BNT162b2 and mRNA- 1273 COVID- 19 vaccines are lipid nanoparticles containing mRNA that codes for the spike protein in the coronavirus.147 The lipid nanoparticle delivery system prevents premature degradation of the genetic instructions necessary for in - dividuals to eventually become protected against SARS- CoV- 2.148 PEG 2000- lipid is a component of the mRNA- 1273 vaccine.

While more research is needed to determine the cause of the potentially increased rate of anaphylaxis to COVID- 19 compared to other vaccines, based on the experience with PEG- conjugated biologics, PEG 2000 in the vaccines is considered the most likely culprit.138,139,149- 153 Therefore, individu - als with a known allergy to PEG should be excluded from vaccination with these vaccines for the time being.154 In addition to PEG, other excipients present in COVID- 19 vaccines, such as distearoyl phospha - tidylcholine, tromethamol, polysorbate 80, and EDTA, should also be evaluated as potential allergenic components Table 7 lists the excipi - ents present in the mRNA and ChAdOx1- S vaccines.155 7|SECTION VI: MANAGEMENT OF VACCINE ALLERGY Treatment of anaphylaxis in the setting of vaccine administration is reviewed in Sokolowska et al156 and Castells et al.137 Briefly, due to the possibility of an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine, any pro - fessional administering the vaccine must be capable of managing an anaphylactic reaction and should have the necessary medications and tools on hand. There must be a mandatory observation period after vaccine administration of at least 15 minutes for all individuals, to allow for the administration of adrenaline in an adequate dose.157 Individuals with a suspected allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine should be followed up by an allergist so that administra - tion of the second dose can be performed in a specialized setting equipped to treat anaphylaxis. One approach used successfully for many vaccine- allergic individuals, but which has not been evaluated for the COVID- 19 vaccines, is to administer the vaccine in incre - mental doses. Any adverse allergic reactions should be promptly reported including any additional information including individual characteristics. 8|SECTION VII: CONCLUSIONS Vaccinations benefit public health and help to reduce the risk of dis - ease across the entire population. Despite early reports of waning of antibody responses over 20 days following SARS- CoV2 infection, evidence is now accumulating that similarly to other infections, re- covered patients develop long- lasting immunity.158 Recently, Har tley et al. reported that patients who have recovered from SARS- CoV- 2 infection have stable virus- specific memory B cells that recognize the spike or nucleocapsid proteins of the SARS- CoV- 2 virus for at least eight months post infection.159 Another study found that neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS- CoV- 2 spike protein persisted for at least 5 months after infection.160 These findings support optimism that the currently licensed vaccines will be effica - cious despite the emergence of highly infectious mutant viruses and are consistent with the limited reports of natural reinfection after confirmed illnesses. These mRNA vaccines are currently not avail - able for children. Moreover, research by Pfizer and researchers from the University of Texas have determined that antibodies from 20 re - cipients of the mRNA BNT162b2vaccine can neutralize the mutant strains in vitro (as yet not peer reviewed).161 It is crucial that further research is conducted to better understand to which components of the currently available vaccines individuals are reacting and how to identify individuals who may be at risk of an adverse allergic reaction (Box 2). Individuals who may be at risk for an allergic response or who have a history of allergic responses to vac - cinations (or their components) should be evaluated by an allergist.60 The best mechanism to further our understanding is to study in - dividuals who have had reactions through a variety of in vitro exper - iments and clinical testing. In vitro experiments including analysis of plasma IgE markers as well as, basophil and mast cell line activation tests can help to better characterize potential allergens and identify individuals at risk of an anaphylaxis. Clinical testing, including skin- prick and intradermal tests, can also help identify allergens and at- risk individuals. All of these tests can involve testing the individual com - ponents of the vaccine to determine the reaction- inducing antigen. However, the critical and pragmatic evaluation of these tests' results in relationship to particular patient's clinical problems remains crucial. Increased understanding of vaccine- related allergies will help to further improve the manufacturing processes and safety of vac - cines. Specifically, through identifying specific vaccine components that cause allergic reactions, vaccine manufacturers can either try to remove or create replacements for those components. This also has an impact on the management of vaccine distribution, specifically BOX 2 Future safety research objectives General COVID19 Develop individualized prediction algorithms to determine risk of a vaccine reaction.
