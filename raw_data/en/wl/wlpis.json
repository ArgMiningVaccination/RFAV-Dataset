There is still no out-of-pocket expense for the vaccine. People should bring their insurance cards to the clinic, as the vaccine provider may bill the insurance for the cost of administration. If you do not have insurance, the vaccine will be available at no charge. Changes to payment for COVID-19 vaccines are likely to occur in the autumn of 2023.
