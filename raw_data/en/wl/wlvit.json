In addition to their radiant beauty, healing crystals do a lot more than just shimmer and bedazzle in the light. In fact, the practice of crystal healing is older than the bible. Despite this time-honored tradition, new-age fads and a sudden influx in popularity have many people questioning the merit of crystal healing. Any form of alternative medicine draws in the skeptics, so if you're unsure as to the breadth and capabilities of healing crystals, we're going to illustrate just how effective they can be. Do healing crystals work? Absolutely, but not in the way you might think. Read on to find out the holistic benefits of using crystals to heal, and what crystal healing really looks like. What Are Healing Crystals? If you've read a lifestyle magazine, blog or been on social media in the last few years, you've likely stumbled across the recent phenomenon of healing crystals. Thing is, they are anything but recent, despite their sudden widespread popularity. The truth is that the ancient Egyptians used gemstones to harness the power of the universe to bring physical and metaphysical healing to their lives. What's more-crystals helped ward off negative energy and evil spirits, and there seemed to be a lot of them around in ancient times. While the world has evolved over the centuries, practitioners of healing crystals use them in the same ways as their ancestors: to clean their space and move positive energy all around. However, because crystals are used for healing, many opponents argue that the practice is hearsay. Rather than seeing the powerful healing benefits, they argue that there's no science to support crystals for healing. However, using crystals is not black and white. In fact, it's emerald and amethyst, rose quartz and carnelian. In other words: there is a broad area of misunderstanding around this holistic practice. We're here to illuminate it. Starting with debunking myths... Are Healing Crystals Magical? As we gravitate toward technology-dependent lives, we're seeing a major resurgence in holistic and ancient healing modalities. The World Health Organization (WHO) released a [ 2019 report ](https://www.who.int/traditional-complementary-integrative-medicine/WhoGlobalReportOnTraditionalAndComplementaryMedicine2019.pdf?ua=1)revealing that 88% of participating member states use traditional and complementary medicine for universal healing. What does this prove? That complementary medicine (alternative medicine), when used alongside traditional medicine, can improve healing. Yet many people make the mistake of thinking it's \"either/or.\" The reason people doubt the power of healing crystals is because the narrative is often relayed incorrectly. For example, many people think proponents of healing crystals advocate for magical healing from all ailments. This is simply not true. It's quite the opposite, which means we have to reframe the point. Healing crystals don't have magical powers that can suddenly mend a broken limb or eliminate diseases. Yet so many people attack the practice exactly for that claim. So, let's get clear on why healing crystals work and how they work: Healing crystals aren't meant to be used in place of medical care, but comprehensively with it. When you invite crystals into your life and living space, the stones emit vibrations that keep energy moving and flowing throughout your life. In this way, crystals can heal from negative energy, stress, and emotional turbulence. However, they can also provide physical healing by disintegrating energy that's compounded in pain points in your body. In this same way, crystals can increase circulation, blood flow and invite peace and calm. So, as you can see, using crystals for healing isn't a form of magic medicine, rather a conduit to elevate your energetic frequency and fill your life with positivity.
