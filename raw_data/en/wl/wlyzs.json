It's set deep within alaya resort so it's secluded and the environment is very relaxing. It is pricer than the massages you can find everywhere else but I guess what you're paying for is quality. I went for the oriental message and upon arriving they offered a welcome drink. The spa room looked really nicely done up, the therapist was friendly and the massage was probably one of the best I've had! They offer coffee/tea and some biscuits after and you can take you're time enjoying the scenery before leaving. Will be back!Visited January 2020Traveled with friendsWritten January 10, 2020 - Zen ModeI have nothing but positive things to say about DaLa Spa. My wife and I just had the most relaxing day of our honeymoon thus far. It didn't hurt that DaLa Spa gave 25% off between the hours of 9:00 - 1:00 pm for hotel guests. From the lemongrass pineapple welcome drink, to our feet being washed, body being scrubbed, and rinsing in a flower bath it gave us the energy to conquer our last few days in Ubud. The staff was very friendly and I would 110% recommend coming if you have the time.Visited March 2020Written March 5, 2020 - An unforgettable and amazing spa in UbudThis is truly an unforgettable spa. Located in the The Alaya, in Ubud, we booked The Samsara treatment, a 4 hour session featuring foot ritual, massage, body scrub, body mask, facial and bath. The choices for oil, scrub etc are traditional and fresh ingredients are used. It was a luxurious experience and we left pampered and felt 10 years younger. One massage involved warm sandalwood pieces and sandalwood oil, the seven flowers bath for two was a dream with hundreds of flowers, the foot ritual a delight in itself, the massages perfect. The spa rooms are huge, with a stand alone bath and ensuite. Rarely do we add reviews but this was too good an experience not to share and we cannot recommend it highly enough.Dear Ibu Sue, Firstly we would like to thank you for visiting us at DaLa Spa and spending your time with us.

Best Regards, DaLa Spa ManagementWritten July 24, 2023This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC.Visited July 2023Traveled as a coupleWritten July 23, 2023 - Probably have better choices in UbudWe wanted to try a massage with the singing bowls so we booked the 75 mins Urat Nusantara. The price is quite reasonable compared to spas at international 5-star hotels but higher than the local joints. The massage was okay but not great and given my partner and I had the same treatment it was kind of weird to have two sounds at the same time. Fortunately it was only a few minutes. In terms of the environment, I found the toilet in the couples room a bit dirty (clearly not cleaned from the previous user) and the light really dim. Made me question the overall hygiene of the place. It wasn't a bad experience but given the limited time one has on holiday, I probably wouldn't head back next time.Visited January 2020Traveled as a coupleWritten January 19, 2020 - Ok massage but careful with your billThe masseuses are decent but only performed routined massage. You can easily find similar ones at other spas. Ambience is nicer than the smaller spas as it's in a hotel (a bit rundown itself), but you probably pay more for the individual rooms etc than the massage itself. Online booking system is handy but doesn't have a place to specify length of massage you need. We wanted to book for 90 minutes Balinese massage but receptionist mistakenly thought we only needed 60 minutes. She suggested that we do 75 minutes. When the bill came, we note the price for 75 minutes Balinese Massage we received is not a pro rata from 90 minutes Balinese massage. Receptionist explained as Balinese massage is either 60 or 99 minutes, to charge us for 75 minutes, she will use the price for another massage which is more expensive but offers 75 minutes option. The difference isn't huge but we couldn't help but feeling a bit cheated and would appreciate some explanation in advance. If you do decide to come here, you'll probably get a decent massage but make sure you ask about pricing to avoid any surprise and stress.Visited January 2020Traveled as a coupleWritten January 4, 2020 - Relaxing massageBooking was a breeze with easy appointment changes due to a tour finishing early. Definitely recommend the Balinese massage for those who want the kinks and knots of daily life to be removed! The masseuse started with a foot wash with an assortment of spices and proceeded with a great \"medium\" pressure massage. Thank you Dala, you definitely deserve the spa awardsVisited February 2020Traveled soloWritten February 21, 2020 - Massage in AlayaThis luxurious spa and massage experience is located behind the Alaya hotel. The whole experience paid great attention to detail on making their guests feel welcome from the beginning including the relaxing music, an encompassing natural green backdrop and the warm service. They provide a questionnaire to customise your experience including what music you would like. Eka was my masseuse who was very kind and checked in with me regularly. Her pressure for the signature massage was just right and she was very experienced. The whole massage was 1 hour. This was followed by some hot tea which was a welcome gesture. They have a number of different rooms but do recommend booking in advance. One of the best in Bali I have had. Highly recommend.Dear Bapak Eric, Firstly we would like to thank you for visiting us at DaLa Spa and spending your time with us.

The welcome ambiance and kindness of the staff is amazing. They receive you with a big smile, the place where you wait at is so relaxing, they serve you delicious drinks before and after the massage. My masseuse, Desi, was just great, it was like she was reading my mind, perfect pressure, perfect technique, truly relaxing.Visited January 2020Traveled as a coupleWritten January 29, 2020 - Devine!We stayed at the Alaya for two weeks and made good use of the spa. We tried both the sandalwood massage and hot stone massage and they were divine. I always felt really comfortable and the spa staff were always super attentive and friendly, I never felt rushed out at the end of treatment. They give you plenty of time to get dressed, ready and even have a lovely drink and cookie waiting at the end. Prices are more than what you see at the spas in the city of Ubud, however they are well worth the extra money for the quality and service you get (I speak from experience of the cheaper ones... avoid!!). Thank you again to all of the spa staff!Dear Ibu Victoria Firstly we would like to thank you for visiting us at DaLa Spa and spending your time with us.

It felt really luxurious and very professional, asked to complete a survey to ensure they could focus on certain areas, the level of pressure you preferred. and asked what music you would like to listen to. The rooms were beautiful but practical including a safe in the room for your valuables. At the end of the massaged I was totally relaxed and think it's probably the best massage experience I've had in Bali. I booked in for the 90 minute signature facial the next day it was so good. Suffice to say that was also excellent with both a arm and leg massage whilst waiting for the mask to do it's work. Would highly recommend and will be back on my next visit.Dear Ms. Megloulou Firstly we would like to thank you for visiting us at DaLa Spa and spending your time with us.

Was greeted politely with enthusiasm. Selected massage oil scent, with sensitivity to any allergies. Was shown to spotlessly clean, spacious and lovely private room. Massage began with a foot bath & scrub in naturally infused water. This was followed by a great massage by a therapist who made sure that the pressure was correct. It was a very relaxing and therapeutic massage. When finished and after changing, we were treated to delicious tea and cookies. Great experience and plan to return!

We are spending a few days here before heading home to the UK. Its so good to be away from all the politics and unrest at home. This place is like heaven. Yesterday I had the Urut Nusamtara body ritual with singing bowl and reiki. Joy, joy, joy. Just the perfect way to start a much needed relaxation break. Foot cleansing, chakra balance, fabulous body massage with a lovely masseuse. The rooms and spa space is perfect. The lemongrass and pineapple drink is amazing. 10/10 Written April 9, 2019 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Apr 2019 Couples I was greeted at reception, with friendly faces and sat to fill out my preferences and sign a waiver. I was given a beautiful Pineapple and Lemongrass drink by a softly spoken hostess. I was also asked to select the oil for my massage, 5 to choose from! I was shown to my treatment room, which was massive and had everything for the other treatments on offer. (Gutted I didn't go for a package) I was asked to get undressed and given everything I needed. Then I received a foot scrub (well received after walking round Ubud and attractions all day!) and then proceeded to the massage. It was great! Front and back! The Masseur really worked the kinks in my back! It was very professional from start to finish! I would highly recommend! Thank you!

Due to the ambience and not necessarily higher price - when staying at Hotel Alaya, the guest gets 25% discount at happy hour time - determined to use our massage \"Tutti Frutti\" here It was a very good decision. It was just everything. Atmosphere, massage, oils, etc. and then the bath. Also the caring provision of comb, brush, hair dryer, etc. The staff is very well trained and understand their craft.

The Balinese massage left me feeling super stretched and relaxed. I also had a facial, which was glorious. She took extra care of my neck like I asked. I felt like I was glowing! After your spa treatments, enjoy the tea, cookies, and amazing spa space. I plan on going back everyday in Bali!!
