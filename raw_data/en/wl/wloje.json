It features mainly shrubby plants, native to the Mediterranean region and present in traditional medicine of this region since Antiquity. The three most diffused species Ruta chalepensis L.,Ruta graveolens L., and Ruta montana (L.) L., are morphologically poorly differentiated and were probably interchangeably used during Antiquity. Aim of the study: Hippocratic and contemporary medical applications of the Ruta genus in the Mediterranean were compared to check if they result from a continuity of use from the ancient times to nowadays.Results: Ruta spp. was mainly employed in medical preparations by Hippocratic physicians as an abortifacient and emmenagogue. In addition to gynaecological conditions, in several treatises of the Corpus Hippocraticum Ruta spp. were also recommended as a specic remedy against pulmonary diseases. Ruta spp. leaves and also roots and seeds, were administered for internal use by Hippocratic physicians after having been soaked in wine or mixed with honey or its derivatives. Contemporary traditional uses of Ruta spp. have been assessed in detail in the whole Mediterranean area.Conclusion: Nowadays, Ruta spp. is used to treat different conditions but, as a general rule, the external uses are preferred as the toxicity of the plant is widely acknowledged.\u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction In his recent synthesis on traditional uses of plants in Italy, the ethnobotanist Paolo Maria Guarrera lists 100+ uses 2006 ). All these species are shrubs, whose bluish-green leaves emit apowerful odour and have a bitter taste. Ruta spp. is among the most-used genera in contemporary Italian traditional medicine,economic botany, and folk life. Such possible intensive use is not Corresponding author.

Signi- cantly, the Ruta genus (family Rutaceae) was already abundantly used in the most ancient systematic record of medical practice ofthe Mediterranean world, the so-called Corpus Hippocraticum , that is, the collection of 62 treatises written between the 5th cen-tury BCE and the 2nd century CE that were attributed at a certainpoint of time to Hippocrates (b. 465 - d. between 375 and 350BCE). In this paper, we compare the Hippocratic and contempo-rary medical applications of the Ruta genus in the Mediterranean basin in order to verify possible similarities and, should they benumerous and signicant enough, to check if they result from acontinuity of use from the ancient times to nowadays. 0378-8741/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Materials and methods Outlines of Ruta spp. in ancient literature The rst therapeutic indications of Ruta spp. (called peganon ; see below for the discussion of the identication) in ancientGreek medical literature can be found in nine Hippocratic trea-tises, none of which is by Hippocrates himself. The treatisesare listed below (English and most commonly used Latin titles)in their plausible chronological order with some informationon their origin and contents ( Jouanna, 1992 ) and with refer- ences to their original text (Greek) and translation (English orFrench): Diseases III (De morbis III )(Hippocrates vol. VI, translator Potter, 1988) : this work contains the description of a certain number of diseases ordered from head to toe ( a capite ad calcem ). Data are from the so-called School of Cnidus and are usually dated to the middle or end of the 5th century BCE. Diseases II (De morbis II )(Hippocrates vol. V , translator Potter, 1988) : the medical information in this treatise, similar to that in Diseases III and arranged in the same way, probably dates back to mid-5th century BCE, even though the workitself might have been written later. It is generally believedthat the material at the origin of the work comes from theso-called School of Cnidus. Nature of women (De natura muliebri )(Hippocrates vol. VII, translator Littr \u00b4e, 1851) : as for the previous treatise, the infor- mation contained in this work is of the mid-5th century BCE,although the work itself was written sometime later. The titledoes not correspond to the contents, but to a rst section thatwas added later. The main part of the work is made of descrip-tions of diseases, mainly of the womb, as in the previoustwo. Diseases of women I-II a col- lection of century BCE data. Sterile )(Hippocrates vol. VIII, translator Littr \u00b4e, 1853) : the data in this treatise are of the same period and origin as those of the previous, that is,mid-5th century and the supposed School of Cnidus. How-ever, such data have been reorganized and rewritten (possiblyseveral times), perhaps in the 4th century. Both deal with thediseases of women from menarche to pregnancy, childbirthto sterility. They also include lists of remedies. Internal affections (De affectionibus interioribus ) (Hippocrates vol. VI, translator Potter, 1988) : this work probably comes from the so-called School of Cnidus andmight be attributed to the years 400-390 BCE. It is a seriesof reports on clinical cases ordered without strict head to toeregularity. Ulcers (De vulneribus )(Hippocrates vol. VIII, translator Potter, 1995) : a 5th/4th century BCE work, this treatise deals with certain wounds, including ulcers. In the second part, itlists medicines for their treatment. Regimen (Regimen )Hippocrates. et al. (1931) (Hippocrates vol. IV , translator Jones, 1931): though similar in contents tothe Hippocratic treatises from the supposed School of Kos, this is a rather independent work, traditionally dated to the5th or the 4th century BCE. Affections (De affectionibus ) (Hippocrates vol. V , translator Potter, 1988) : this work, which can probably be dated to the 380s BCE, somewhat resembles other Hippocratic treatisesfrom the Cnidian School, although it also differs substantiallyfrom Cnidus teaching. Data collected from these works were complemented by means of additional medical and scientic literature, listed herein chronological order: theProblems (Probl emata )(Aristotle, books 1-21, translator Hett, 1978) : once attributed to Aristotle himself (384-322 BCE), they are now more correctly attributed to his school,being notebooks in which the teachers and students of theschool wrote down both the scientic questions they wereinterested in and the solutions each of them could bring overtime. This explains why some questions have been repeatedlytreated, sometimes in contradictory ways. De materia medica (in Greek peri ul es iatrik es, Greek text byWellmann, 1906-1914 and English translation by Beck, 2005 ) by Dioscorides (1st century CE). Often considered as herbal, the work is in fact an encyclopaedia of the naturalproducts from the three reigns (vegetal, mineral, and animal)used at Dioscorides' time, and known to him, for work made (each devoted to a specic topic), Pliny analysedthe medicinal uses of plants in books 20-27 ( Jones, 1951, 1956 ). Finally, medical and therapeutic elements need to be com- plemented with botanical information. The main source on thispoint is the work traditionally known as Historia plantarum ,b u t more correctly cited as Enquiry into plants (1916-1926) ,b yt h e so-called Father of Botany, Theophrastus (387-278 BCE), aswell as another work by the same author, De causis plantarum (1976-1990) . As for data on contemporary uses of Ruta spp., they have been collected from modern ethnobotanical literature mentioned inthe bibliographical list at the end of the article and summarizedinTable 2 . Data on the uses of medicinal plants in the Corpus Hippo- craticum have been compiled on the basis of the original Greek text by Alain Touwaide and databased by Emanuela Appetiti(ACCESS database). This material has already permitted a rstanalysis of the uses of plants in the Corpus Hippocraticum (Aliotta et al., 2003 ). Additional work is underway by Alain Touwaide. Traditional medical indications of Ruta spp. cur- rently used for therapeutic purposes in Mediterranean area havebeen collected from the literature listed below and databased byAntonino De Natale ( Table 2 ).Author's personal copy A. Pollio et al. / Journal of Ethnopharmacology 116 (2008) 469-482 471 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Identication of p eganon as Ruta spp. in ancient texts An abundant literature has been devoted to the identica- tion of the plants mentioned in ancient literature according toLinnean binomial nomenclature ( Touwaide, 1997, 1998 ; more specically, also see Moisan, 1990 ). The historian of medieval botany and herbalism Jerry Stannard (1961) renewed the question by suggesting to combine philological and phytogeographical data, and to complete thesedata with the morphological information to be found in Enquiry into plants by Theophrastus, which was written approximately a century after the most ancient treatises of the Corpus Hippo- craticum . More recently, an interdisciplinary research conducted by a team associating philology, botany, and pharmacology(Aliotta et al., 2003 ) concluded that many authors who have worked on the topic since the early 19th century generally agreeon the identication of a large majority of the plants men-tioned in the Corpus Hippocraticum . Such a conclusion has been conrmed by Buenz et al. (2004) , for whom the identication of the plant-based prescriptions in the Corpus Hippocraticum - supposedly totalling 257 items - is uncertain for only 11plants. Post-Linnean authors are almost unanimous in considering that the Greek phytonym peganon corresponds to the ever- green shrub Ruta graveolens L. (Andr \u00b4e, 1985 ). The plant is not described in any of the treatises of the Corpus Hippocraticum , maybe because it was well known, as its high number of thera-peutic uses suggest. The earliest botanical descriptions of it arefound in Theophrastus' Enquiry into plants (HP) and De causis plantarum (CP).Ruta spp. is described sometimes as a typical evergreen undershrub ( HP1.3.1 and 1.9.4) 6.14.7, 6.14.12, 6.20.1). As an under- shrub it can assume a tree habit ( HP1.3.4), with dry wood ( HP 6.7.3) and fleshy ( HP1.10.4), which 1.9.4). cultivated HP7.4.1), although he is ambiguous about the exis- tence of a wild and a cultivated species: while early in HPhe afrms that only one species of the plant was known ( HP7.4.1), later on in the same treatise he afrms that the cultivated plantdiffers somewhat from the wild one, this latter having \"leavesand stalks smaller and rougher\", and being \"more pungent andstronger in CP, when he anal- yses the difference in fragrance in cultivated and wild speciesofRuta spp., he afrms that fragrance can become too pungent in wild varieties ( CP6.20.1; the text is signicant, dening the wild variety as resembling the cultivated one, without clearlydistinguishing the characteristics of the wild species). He mayhave grouped a variety of plants under the name p eganon as is shown by his comment that \"various plants are called Ruta spp.\" ( HP1.10.4). Whatever the case, according to Theophras- tus,Ruta spp. is propagated through a cutting from a branch (HP2.1.3 and 7.2.1) or from a detached sucker, as well as from other parts ( CP1.4.2). Seed propagation is also possible, although, according to Theophrastus, some deny it because it isslow ( HP7.2.1). The plant dislikes dung ( HP7.5.1) and ben-ets from saline water as is shown by the fact that it improves when watered with it ( CP2.5.3). To paraphrase the Greek text, ashes are applied to its roots to protect them from worms anddecomposition ( CP3.17.1), and the plant gets hard and dry, but, when it has grown up again after being cut down, it is larger,ner, and juicier ( CP3.19.2). When growing \"in a g tree\", it is of the best quality as g juice feeds Ruta spp. and pro- vides a remedy to Ruta spp. if necessary as it is hot ( CP5.6.10). The fragrance of the plant is analysed in some detail in CP. It is dened as dry, pungent, and astringent, and considered tooccur not in the fruit, but in the other parts of the plant ( CP 6.14.7). Such fragrance becomes worse when dryness goes toofar, and is too pungent and harsh ( CP6.14.12). In such case, it is as pungent and untempered as to become disagreeable ( CP 6.16.7). In the Problems from Aristotle's school, Ruta spp. is mainly mentioned as a cultivated and edible plant, often associated withgs and eaten at the beginning of meals, since it was thoughtvaluable against evil-eye (Aristotle, books 1-21, translator Hett, 1978) . Dioscorides in De Materia Medica (3.45) does not add any new element to Theophrastus' description. However, he moreclearly afrms the existence of a wild species which he considersharsher than the cultivated species and unt to eat, just like thespecies growing in mountains. Also he explicitly mentions thatthe cultivated species growing close to g trees is more edible. Pliny gives some information in Naturalis Historia , partic- ularly on the cultivation of Ruta spp. For him, indeed, it is sown in spring and after the autumn equinox (19.156), growsboth from seeds and cuttings (19.121), and blossoms in a bunch(19.100). In spite of this good general correspondence between the characteristics of Ruta spp. in Theophrastus and those of Ruta graveolens L., it cannot be excluded that other members of the genus Ruta could have been collected and used by Hip- pocratic physicians time for the same medicinal purposes asRuta graveolens L. The centre of diversity for Ruta spp. cov- ers indeed the entire Mediterranean area, with some speciesendemic only to Corsica and the Canary Islands, and others witha larger distribution not necessarily limited to the Mediterraneanarea but extending to Africa, Asia, and the American conti-nent. The species with the widest diffusion are Ruta chalepensis L. (including Ruta angustifolia Pers.) and Ruta graveolens L., the latter also being frequently cultivated. Ruta montana (L.) L. is also widespread in the Mediterranean area, mainlyin dry and rocky habitats ( Tutin et al., 1968 ). The taxonomy ofRuta spp. is based on the floral morphology, and species limits are not currently well known, but are the object of acontinuing study of species boundaries and biogeographic pat-terns ( Conti, in press Ruta mon- tana (L.) L. might have been confused (or associated) by the physicians of the Corpus Hippocraticum , particularly because the flower of the three species is neither described nor men-tioned as a descriptor in ancient medical texts, and all threespecies have partially overlapping geographical distribution pat-terns.Author's personal copy 472 A.

Therapeutic indications The several therapeutic uses of peganon in the Hippocratic treatises listed above are presented in Table 1 and can be sum- marized as follows. Ruta spp. was prescribed to treat pulmonary diseases ( Morb. III ,1 5a n d Morb. II 47 and 64), included phthi- sis(Aff.Int.,12; Morb. II , 50), which might correspond at least in part to modern tuberculosis ( Stannard, 1961 ).Ruta spp. draughts were also used gargle against throat angina ( Morb II , 26), and to reduce a swelling of the spleen, which might be one of thesymptoms of malaria ( Aff. Int ., 30). Ruta spp. is also included among the herbs employed externally to cure wounds ( Vuln., 11). The major number of therapeutic uses of Ruta spp. is in the eld of gynaecology. Ruta spp. was mainly used for the treatment of various ailments of the womb, which are not necessarily wellidentied. Usteria , for example, which does not correspond by any means to the process described by this term in modern neu-ropsychiatry, was considered to be a move of the uterus withinthe female body. In so doing, it could disturb respiration, pro-voking the so-called uterine suffocation , as well as other vital functions. It seems reasonable to consider that the term was ageneric one to designate any kind of uterine condition ( Potter, 1990 ).Ruta spp. was also prescribed for menses disturbance, be it their regulation, amenorrhea or excess. It was administeredboth as an abortive and to help conception. It was prescribedto treat all the possible disturbances during pregnancy, dur-ing the delivery, to expel the placenta, and against puerperalfever. The use of Ruta spp. for different, and sometimes oppo- site, gynaecological conditions might result from the fact thattheCorpus Hippocraticum is a collection of treatises from dif- ferent times, locations, and also methodological approaches topharmacological treatment of disease. There were mainly twoways to treat disease: by administering medicines counteract-ing disease mechanisms according to the principle contraria contrariis (principle of contrary) or by imitating disease mech- anisms according to similia similibus (principle of similarity). In both cases, medicines were credited with the role of restoringthe right balance of the physiological components of the body,which, in the specic case of the Hippocratic system(s) werethe yellow bile and black bile. AsRuta spp. was credited with hot and dry properties, it could be used either to treat inflammations (heat against heat; principleof similarity) or to reduce any excess of fluids in the body (heatagainst moisture and cold; principle of contrary). It might be worth mentioning that the name peganon has been interpreted by philologists as deriving from a Greek rootof which the verb pegnumi is another derivative ( Andr 1985 ). Yet the root and, hence, the verb derived from it, mean to flow orto make flow , something that might refer to the use of Ruta spp. as an abortifacient. If so, the very name of the plant mighthave been produced on the basis of its use according to theprinciple of contrary ( contraria contrariis ). The heat with which Ruta spp. was credited was applied to provoke an eliminationAuthor's personal copy 474 A.

If we do not take into considerationthe gynaecological indications, Ruta spp. seems indeed to have mainly been used as a medicine against pulmonary and throatirritations in the most ancient treatises. Later, there is still anindication for a pulmonary disease ( phthisis ), but there are also new ones: wounds and a swelling of the spleen. Also, the dietaryproperties of Ruta spp. are formulated in an abstract and theo- retical way (hot and dry). All this suggests not only a possibleexpansion of the use of the plant, something that might sug-gest therapeutic experiments, but also an attempt to express theseveral uses of the plant by means of a theoretical property(i.e. hot or dry) that might account for the several individualapplications. 3.2.2. Preparations Ruta spp. was used entirely (the fresh plant) or in parts, espe- cially the leaves, but also its seeds, and, less frequently, its roots(Table 1 ). For internal use, Ruta spp. was administered after hav- ing been soaked in wine or mixed with honey or its derivatives(Table 1 ). As for the excipients for internal administration, wine was among the most used in Hippocratic pharmaco-therapy. Severalvarieties are mentioned, ranging from retines(a resin-flavoured wine) to black or white ones. It could be young or old, sweetor dry, perfumed, mixed with water or pure. Wine use was notlimited to an excipient, as it was also credited with therapeuticproperties and was frequently prescribed in the cure of differentdiseases and recommended as an anodyn e- i.e. an analgesic - of very valuable efcacy. Honey was another excipient. It was used pure or in such derivatives as melikraton , a mixture of honey and water, and oxugluku , a mixture of vinegar and honey. Just like wine, it was an excipient and a therapeutic substance of its own, particu-larly used for the treatment of respiratory and gynaecologicaltroubles, as well as for conditions of the skin and eyes ( Byl, 1996 ). Sometimes Hippocratic medicines were made of several active substances. Ruta spp. was mixed with other herbs, the most frequent which were koriannon (Coriandrum cyminum L.). All these species are not native to the Greek mainland and arrived probably fromNear East. Laskaris (1996) has suggested that these plants are related to ancient healing cults diffused in Crete. Other plantsmixed Ruta spp. the fact of having been credited with hot and dry properties according to the system of the four qualities, fourelements of the world, and four humours. The combination ofthese plants with Ruta spp. was probably justied by their com- mon therapeutic action, and their mixture was perhaps aimed at reinforcing such action.Author's personal copy 478 A.

Pollio et al. / Journal of Ethnopharmacology 116 (2008) 469-482 479 3.3. Contemporary traditional uses of Ruta spp. Available documentation on contemporary traditional uses ofRuta spp. in the Mediterranean basin varies from region to region. For Spain and Italy, and, to a lesser extent, Turkey, a con-spicuous corpus of ethnopharmacological data is documented,whereas information is scanty and often vague for the rest ofcontemporary Mediterranean world. However, some commonfeatures in the therapeutic uses of Ruta spp. can be evidenced. Leaves are the most frequently used part of the plant, but it is also common to administer the entire aerial parts. Flowersand roots only are used in few unrelated locations, while theyare used in association with the leaves for the same conditionselsewhere. Use of seeds has been reported prevalently in Turkey(Akalin and Ertu g, 2002-2003 ). Therapeutic indications cover a wide range of medical con- ditions affecting almost all parts of human body, even though inmany cases they are general and do not refer to any specic partof the body. This is particularly evident for the countries withno recent detailed ethnopharmacological study such as Algeria,Morocco, and Tunisia. In addition, the indications for EasternEurope (Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Greece) are far from being pre-cise in the current state of research. Focusing on Spain, Italy,and Turkey, it is possible to have a clearer idea of the actualmedicinal uses of the plant, although the resulting picture isnot homogeneous. In Spain, Ruta spp. is mainly prescribed to cure menstrual disorders and as abortifacients, and also againstdigestive disorders ( San Miguel, 2003 ). Anthielminthic and ver- mifuge are by far the most common properties throughout Italy,including Sicily and Sardinia. Anti-inflammatory and analgesicproperties are second to the previous. A survey carried out amongherbalists in 40 provinces of Turkey has revealed that the plant ismainly prescribed as a laxative ( Akalin and Ertu g, 2002-2003 ), whereas eld investigation evidenced that therapeutic indica-tions vary from region to region, and include a wide array ofdiseases ( Table 2 ). The most frequent type of preparation for internal use is infu- sions and/or decoctions of Ruta spp. leaves, whereas for external use direct application of fresh leaves or juice is the standard typeof administration. Oleolites made by frying Ruta spp. leaves in olive oil are frequent in Spain and Italy. They are recommendedagainst rheumatisms. A similar preparation is used in Turkey toprepare a cataplasm against severe ). Ruta spp. is frequently used with other herbs. Complex recipes are rarely described. In Italy and Spain Ruta spp. is most frequently associated with members of Nepeta orThymus genera, and also garlic ( Allium sp. pl.). Of the two cases of plants being mixed with Ruta spp. in Turkey, one includes Nigella sativa L., is frequently used in folk recipes in the Near East against numerous conditions, mainly involvingthe vascular and respiratory systems ( Aliotta et al., 2003 ). The comparison between the Corpus Hippocraticum and modern Mediterranean ethnopharmacology ( Table 3 ) evidences differences not only in the uses, something that led the early-20th century German pharmacognosist Rudolf Schmid (1919)to omit Ruta spp. from among the plants of antiquity still used at that time, but also, and perhaps more signicantly, in the waysof preparing medicines made of Ruta spp. In the Corpus Hippocraticum, Ruta spp. was macerated in, and administered with wine, or mixed with hydromel. In othercases, Ruta spp. was pounded, mixed into wine, and immediately drunk ( Table 1 ). Although hot water extracts (both as decoctions and infusions) were used by Hippocratic practitioners, there isno mention of these preparations for Ruta spp. By contrast, both infusions and decoctions represent the most diffused way ofpreparing higher medicinal plants, including Ruta spp., in mod- ern Mediterranean ethnopharmacognosy. It is well known thatthe choice of a solvent influences the chemical composition ofthe extract, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Although noneof the extractants is ideal, wine, considered as a diluted ethano-lic solvent, should ensure high rates of extraction of non-polarand polar substances, also at ambient temperature. On the otherhand, water extracts, which are carried out at high temperature(>90 C), could damage thermo-labile compounds ( Eloff, 1998 ). Administering Ruta spp. leaves after maceration in wine might ensure the preservation of the major chemical constituents of theplant. 4. Conclusions Ruta spp. has been constantly present in the Western thera- peutic from Hippocratic medicine on. Not only did Dioscoridesand Galen ( On the mixtures and properties of simple medicines ) mention it in their major works on materia medica, but also lateantique manuals of therapeutics such as the Medicines from Veg- etables and Fruits by Gargilius Martialis (d. 260 CE) and the Pseudo Apuleius, which was written sometimes in the 4th cen-tury CE and circulated widely in the pre-1100 Western world,devoted each a paragraph to the plant. The more typically West-ern recipe book known as the Lorscher Book of Medicines , used sometimes around 800 BC in the Abbey of Lorsch in Carolin-gian Germany, included it in several prescriptions. In the Arabicworld, Ruta spp. is present in the CE)and ibn Baytar (ca. 1204-1248), as well as in other therapeuticworks as those of ibn Butlan (d. 1063 his 980-1060 CE). After the translation ofArabic medicine into Latin from the late-11th to the 13th cen-tury, Arabic pharmacological knowledge was available in theWest. Ruta spp. appeared in the many versions of the Tacuinum Sanitatis , an adaptation of ibn Butlan's work, as well as in the so-called Circa Instans andBook on Simple Medicines from the Salerno school, which were among the most diffused andinfluential works on medicinal plants in the Late Middle Ages.With the rediscovery of Greek scientic texts in the Renaissance,the information to be found in Dioscorides' De materia medica was again available and abundantly commented on, particularlyby Pietro Andrea Mattioli (1501-1577), whose repeated neweditions of his commented translation of Dioscorides' treatisecontributed to popularize the traditional Greek uses of plants,including Ruta spp. New 16th-century herbals such (1542) Leonhart Fuchs (1501-1566), rootedAuthor's personal copy 480 A. Pollio et al. / Journal of Ethnopharmacology 116 (2008) 469-482 in ancient science, expanded on it, and integrated local uses of plants into traditional knowledge, among others Ruta spp. At the turn of the 19th-20th centuries, Georg Dragendorf includedit in his (Stuttgart, 1898), which was a sort of summary of traditional uses. The medicinal uses of Ruta species in the Corpus Hippo- craticum were preserved at least in part over time. Nevertheless, during the centuries, Ruta spp. was prevalently administered against eye affections and different kinds of aches, and as anantidote against poisons and venomous bites by various ani-mals. Also, the plant got an increasingly growing symbolicvalue. Thanks to its numerous little leaves, it was used tosprinkle the Holy Water and to bless people in the Romanrites of the Catholic Church. Known for this reason as Herb of grace (Cleene and Lejeune, 2003 ),Ruta spp. was among the rst plants introduced by Europeans in the New World.Heinrich et al. (2006) have suggested that this religious role contributed to promote the therapeutic uses of Ruta spp. in Latin America. The ethnopharmacology of Ruta spp. in the Mediterranean area does not seem to have been influenced by the symbology andritual uses of the plant. Ruta spp. was considered by Hippocratic physicians as a remedy mainly suitable for women diseases and,secondarily, as an effective pharmakon in the cure of pulmonary affections. Although these indications have remained alive incircum-Mediterranean countries through the centuries, there isnow a greater awareness of the potential toxicity of the plant.Current recommended therapeutic indications of Ruta spp. are no longer related to the gynaecological sphere, with the excep-tion of the use as an abortifacient. Ruta spp. is still used internally in the treatment of pulmonary diseases, and externally as an anti-helmintic and antirheumatic (something that constitutes the mostfrequent uses of the plant). Often it is treated at high tempera-ture before being administered. These current indications seemto suggest that a shift towards a safer application occurred at acertain point in time. If so, this evolution might have been amongthe factors that contributed to eliminate many of the Hippocraticuses. References Abu-Irmaileh, E.B., A, U.F., 2003.
