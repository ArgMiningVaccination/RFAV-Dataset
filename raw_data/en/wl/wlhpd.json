It focuses on using natural remedies to address the underlying causes of illness and health issues. As a naturopath, Dr. Clark calls upon botanical medicine, homeopathy, biotherapeutic drainage, nutritional supplements, and lifestyle adjustments in her treatment plans. These therapies work together to address imbalances, reduce pain and inflammation, and align the body, both structurally and energetically . THE BASIC PRINCIPLES of NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE The Healing Power of Nature Trust in the body's inherent wisdom to heal itself. Doctor as Teacher Educate patients in the steps to achieving and maintaining health. Treat the Whole Person View the body as an integrated whole in all its dimensions. Prevention Focus on overall health, wellness and disease prevention. Identify & Treat the Causes Look beyond the symptoms to the underlying cause. First Do No Harm Utilize the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies. Botanical Medicine, also known as herbalism or herbal medicine, is a medical system based on the use of plants or plant extracts to induce healing. Since ancient times, Botanical Medicine has been used by many different cultures throughout the world. Herbal remedies in the form of extracts, tinctures, capsules, and tablets may be recommended by Dr. Clark to treat illness and assist with bodily functions. As a Doctor of Chinese Medicine, she may also suggest herbal remedies that can help address the patient's health from a holistic perspective. Some common examples of herbs that can be used as medicine include: - ALOE: can be used topically for minor burns, sunburns, skin irritations, or inflammation. - ARNICA: can be used topically for bruises, sprains, sore muscles, and joints. - GINGER: can be ingested to treat nausea. - TURMERIC: can be ingested to combat inflammation and protect against disease. - PEPPERMINT OIL: can be ingested for chronic intestinal ailments. - CASTOR OIL: can be used topically to treat menstrual cramps or constipation. Botanical Medicine is considered to be most effective when combined with a treatment plan that also includes dietary modification, proper exercise, and stress reduction. With her vast herbal knowledge, Dr. Clark can incorporate a combination of herbal remedies specific to your needs. Homeopathy is an effective system of alternative medicine that addresses a patient's unique expression of disease. Created by Samuel Hahneman in 1796, Homeopathy is based on the law of similars, meaning \"what a substance can cause, it can cure\". Homeopathic remedies are prepared through a series of dilutions that reduce a substance to its purest form, where it becomes a catalyst for the body's ability to achieve a deeper level of healing. By addressing the root cause of illness, homeopathic remedies are often beneficial for patients who do not respond well to traditional Western treatments, and are safe to use among patients of all ages, including babies, children, pregnant and nursing women, as well as senior citizens. BIOTHERAPEUTIC DRAINAGE Developed through a series of distillation processes, UNDA substances are used to normalize physiology at both an intracellular and extracellular level. They encourage the regular elimination of toxins that burden the body and can help address health problems that result from poor nutrition, stress overload, and environmental toxins. Dr. Clark may recommend UNDA remedies to decrease cellular toxicity and restore homeostasis. NUTRITIONAL PLANS AND LIFESTYLE ADJUSTMENTS Health is achieved through everyday habits, one of the most important being how we eat. Dr. Clark comprehensively addresses diet and nutrition to educate her patients about healthy lifestyle choices, empowering them to live a more balanced life. "}
