It could be Asthma which can restrict many of your life activities. Asthma is a chronic (long standing) respiratory disease which affects all age groups, however it is more common in young kids and females. It is a disease, where an individual faces repeated bouts of breathlessness and wheezing caused by narrowing of airways, which produces excess mucus and breathing becomes difficult. As per the World Health Organisation, Asthma affects the life of around 235 million people worldwide, causing 2.5 lakh deaths, especially elderly people. Asthma is non-communicable in nature and develops due to the body's reaction to certain allergens or things that are otherwise harmless to other individuals. Homoeopathy treatment has relieved millions of people globally and while it provides immediate relief it also offers long term relief in most cases. With some lifestyle changes Homeopathy has carved its way towards success in treatment and management of Asthma. Why you should trust Homeopathy? - Homeopathy decreases the airway inflammation and reduces the intensity and severity of acute attacks. It decreases the duration of attack and makes breathing easier for the patient. - Homeopathy acts on holistic level and triggers the body's natural defense. This improves immunity and prevents frequent recurrence in chronic cases. - Early homeopathic treatment reduces your visit to the hospital emergency department and use of bronchodilators (asthma pumps) and steroids. - Homeopathy causes no adverse effects on patients and hence is very much recommended for young kids, pregnant ladies, elderly and people with immune-compromised diseases. - Homeopathy treats the underlying root cause and with some lifestyle alteration to provide better life quality. - We cannot change our body, but we can change its response to triggers. Homoeopathy treatment helps in modifying your body's hypersensitive response to 'allergens' or triggers. Therefore, in spite of their presence your body does not react to it in a negative way. People with asthma miss school, work, sports and other activities more frequently. They need to be always on guard to identify and avoid the triggers of asthma. With some simple steps you can manage your asthma better- - Avoid any known asthma trigger. - Take hot steam to clear nasal passages. - Add ginger, garlic, honey, liquor ice, turmeric, ajwain, apples, carrots, green vegetables, flax seeds to your diet routine to combat asthma better. - Avoid coloured, canned, and processed food items. - Maintain food diary. Take notes if, you have any new food, and it triggers asthma. - Avoid sudden emotional arousal like fear, anger, physical exertion, stress. - Relax with yoga, meditation. - Never take medication without consulting your doctor first. - Adhere to your doctor's advice and treatment plans. You cannot always avoid and stop the trigger but you can develop immunity to fight it better. Homeopathy is helpful in both building and restoring immunity.
