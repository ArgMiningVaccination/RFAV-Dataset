Our Team Mark Hancock MD MPHPhysician Mark Hancock, MD, MPH founded Humanizing Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, together with his wife Enid, in 2015. The clinic is strongly rooted in the couple's belief that everyone should have quality integrative healthcare options. Dr. Hancock has worked with Anthroposophic Medicine, which originally introduced mistletoe as a cancer care therapy over one hundred years ago, for his entire professional career. Dr Hancock graduated summa cum laude from Saint George's Medical School in 2008 and was elected Chief Resident during his training at University of New Mexico Hospital. He was introduced to the advanced use of mistletoe by Dr. Maurice Orange, greatly impacting his life course. Dr. Hancock's journey through life has been full and varied and has taken him through art, philosophy, science, and even some farm work, before ultimately landing in medicine.

Enid's passion for healing has always been evident - at age 6 she was already applying poultices and compresses for her siblings and friends. After studying at the Goetheanum, the world headquarters of the anthroposophical movement, and touring anthroposophic hospitals and pharmacies in Switzerland, she knew she wanted to be a part of a medical practice that combines modern and alternative treatments to best help each patient on their journey to healing.
