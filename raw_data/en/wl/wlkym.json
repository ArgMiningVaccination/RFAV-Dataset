However, there are still many steps hospitals can take to increase their profitability amid these economic conditions. Industry experts say that hospitals wishing to in- crease their profitability can focus on two key ar - eas \u2014 reducing costs and increasing reimburse-ment. Here are 10 best practices for increasing hospital profitability by reducing costs and in-creasing revenue and reimbursement. 1. Reduce staffing costs by using data to drive staffing decisions.

Last year and in 2007, the nation's hospitals, as a whole, recorded record profits. Many hospitals were examining a multitude of options for debt financing. Nearly 20 percent or more of the na-tion's hospitals were in the process of renovating, expanding or replacing their current hospitals.

BUSINESS & LEGA L ISSUES FOR HEAL TH SYSTEM LEADERSHIPHospital Review5 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review E-Weekly at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 The first six months of 2009 have been an extraordinary time in the healthcare sector. First, this letter first discusses certain ob - servations regarding healthcare reform. Second, this letter notes new white papers available and provides information on two upcoming conferences. 1. Healthcare reform. The healthcare industry, including both payors and providers, is starting to consolidate its positions against significant health- care reform. Healthcare reform can briefly be categorized into two distinct parts. First, covering the uninsured. Most parties are wholly for some method of assuring that all people have coverage. With coverage, the core concerns seem to be will coverage lead to reduced reimbursement or to extraordinary national debt. Second, providing an alternative option, a \"public option\" for insurance, to traditional managed care plans and companies. It is the second part of healthcare reform that has parties greatly concerned. From a payor perspective, a public option is viewed as government-spon- sored competition against them. Further, they have concern that a govern-ment-sponsored model will be less expensive, that the government will have to deal with less problems (e.g., can unilaterally set rates and it will be immune from lawsuits) and that it will significantly and negatively impact the number of parties that are covered by the traditional large insurance companies. From a provider perspective, a public option is concerning because provid- ers get paid, on average, substantially less by governmental plans than they do by commercial plans. For example, hospitals are paid approximately 70 percent by government plans compared with what they get paid by com-mercial plans. Surgery centers and physicians are generally paid between 70-80 percent on average by governmental plans as compared to commer - cial plans. Thus, the migration of patients from commercial plans to public plans is viewed by providers as likely to cause a substantial negative direct hit to their revenues. This revenue loss would, in most places, be a direct negative reduction to the bottom line. Over the last few months and next several months, as the President in- creases efforts to implement substantial healthcare reform, it will be inter - esting to see the extent of efforts by parties such as the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and the Association of Health Insurance Plans to respond to the President's efforts. At first, these parties tended to give positive lip service to the concepts of healthcare re-form. Now that they see that the administration seems quite serious about healthcare reform, the gloves are beginning to come off. 2. White Papers.

Hospitals leaders can consider the use of flexible staffing, such as part-time or hourly employees, and adjust staffing based on patient census data. Leaders should also monitor the efficiency of this staffing by continuously reviewing bench-marking data such as hours worked per case. Amy Floria, CFO of Goshen (Ind.) Health Sys - tem, says that her facility monitors patient vol- ume on a daily basis and adjusts staffing accord-ingly. \"We adjust our nursing staffing every eight hours after looking at our inpatient volume and expected discharges and admits,\" she says. Kevin Burchill, a director at Beacon Partners, a healthcare management consulting firm, agrees that staffing must be adjusted daily. \"The easiest thing that a hospital can do to improve profitabil-ity is for the senior management team to assume responsibility for the day-to-day performance of an organization and look at the organization's performance in real time,\" he says. \"You must shift to an emphasis on the day-to-day, not pay-period to pay-period or month-to-month.\"It is important that concerns regarding efficient staffing are communicated throughout the orga- nization and that hospital leaders work in collab- oration with physicians. Donna Worsham, COO of National Surgical Hospitals, suggests that hospital leaders share staffing efficiency bench-marking data with unit managers and provide feedback regarding the productivity of the unit. Flexible staffing is especially useful for OR nurs- ing staff. OR managers should review clock-in times versus surgery-start times and determine if their staff is consistently arriving before a surgery actually begins. If this is the case, mangers can uti- lize flexible staffing to allow nursing staff to arrive later so that when surgeries run over, no overtime expenses are incurred, says Ms. Worsham. Other facilities are saving in staffing costs by re- ducing benefits for full-time staff. Goshen Health System, for example, deferred merit increases, reduced paid vacation time and suspended its retirement matching program in response to the current economy, according to Goshen's CEO, Jim Dague. Goshen reduced employee dissat - isfaction in response to these cuts by soliciting employee feedback on which benefits to reduce, thereby building organizational support for the changes. In addition, Goshen's executives took a voluntary 20 percent cut in order to help sustain the system through the recession. Joe Freudenberger, CEO of OakBend Regional Medical Center in Richmond, Texas, agrees that staff must buy in to any reductions in hours and shifts worked that will personally affect them in order for the hospital to remain successful. He says that hospital leaders must communicate the reasoning for these changes to the staff before making them. \"If we call off staff, they see it as personally hurting their income when we need to help them understand that it is actually preserving their income by maintaining the financial viability of the hospital,\" he says. \"It may be obvious to us that we're calling them off because we have a significant reduction in patient volume but we need to communicate that to them for them to understand the financial realties we face.\" Although some staffing cuts may be necessary, hospitals should be careful not to take a blanket approach to layoffs or cuts in services. Hospital leaders must take a close look at their business before making cuts. \"Don't make the same mistake everyone else does \u2014 don't look at bottom line, determine that you need to cut $1 million, for example, and 10 Best Practices for Increasing Hospital Profitability (continued from page 1) Medical Device Solutions Just got a The first name in New Look We're known for a few firsts.

Doing so will trim some fat but will cut meat and bone in other areas,\" says Mr. Burchill. He suggests that hospitals assess each program individually and determine which ones are what are winners and losers. \"You do not want to cut areas that you should be doing more of or that are already profitable,\" says Mr. Burchill. 2. Reduce supply costs by better man- aging vendors. Hospital leaders can reduce supply costs by working with vendors to im- prove contracts and encouraging physicians to make fiscally responsible supply decisions. \"When it comes to supply costs, you must drive this expense or the vendor will drive it for you,\" says Ms. Worsham. Hospital leaders should not shy away from ap- proaching vendors for discounts. Goshen's IT director recently requested a discount on the health system's contract for IT maintenance due to current economic conditions and successfully received a discount that saved the hospital 15 per - cent on this contract, according to Ms. Floria. Hospitals can also reduce supply costs be reduc - ing the number of vendors. Goshen, for exam- ple, is in the process of reducing the number of vendors in its surgical suite and aims to eventu - ally scale the vendors down to 4-6 companies. \"This action is expected to save us at least a mil-lion dollars in supply costs,\" says Mr. Dague. Another way in which hospitals may reduce supply costs is by requiring vendors to submit purchase orders for any equipment or implants that are not included in a negotiated, written agreement with the facility. \"All of our vendors sign agreements that any purchase orders must be submitted at least 24 hours before a procedure and must be ap-proved by the materials manager or the CEO, or it's free,\" says Ms. Worsham. \"If you don't require this, vendors will drop off the invoice for a pricey piece of equipment or implant after the proce - dure has already taken place and walk out the back door, which can greatly hurt your profitability.\" 3. ensure that your OR is utilized by physicians efficiently. All hospitals can benefit from tightening up the efficiency of their operating rooms, but it is especially critical that less busy facilities ensure that their ORs are used as efficiently as possible. \"Hospitals need to review block time utiliza- tion,\" says Ms. Worsham. \"Physicians who are assigned more time than they are using are hurt - ing your profitability.\" Ms. Worsham suggests that hospital OR man- agers work directly with physicians to make OR utilization more efficient. \"When physicians' schedules create gaps in the OR schedule, it effects a hospital's ability to staff effectively, which can create significant labor costs for the hospital,\" says Ms. Worsham. 4. involve physicians in cost reduction efforts. Hospitals should work to encourage physicians to become more concerned about the costs of supplies and other activities, such as un- necessary tests and inefficient coding processes that may drive up hospital costs. \"Hospitals today have a unique opportunity to leverage physicians' interest in having hospitals help to stabilize their incomes with the hospitals' needs to involve physicians in cutting costs and improving quality,\" says Nathan Kaufman, man-aging director of Kaufman Strategic Advisors, a hospital consulting firm. Hospitals can encourage the use of products from vendors that are cost-effective, but still high quality, especially in areas such as orthope- dic implants, which can be considerably costly for hospitals. In addition, experts say the use of protocol-based care can reduce costs associated with unnecessary tests or treatments. Mr. Freudenberger says that one of the biggest mistakes hospitals make is not engaging medical staff in profitability. \"Physicians have a huge role in maintaining hospital profitability, but unless you give them a reason to be concerned with a hospital's profitability, they will make choices in what and to whom they refer services that will not consider the implications to the hospi-tal,\" says Mr. Freudenberger. \"Hospital leaders should work to help medical staff understand the connection of their referrals to the hospital's viability so that their referral decisions reflect the value they place on the hospital.\" 5. Consider outsourcing the manage- ment of some services. During tough eco- nomic times, some hospitals may benefit from out - sourcing or partnering with other organizations for certain services, such as food and laundry services, and even, in some cases, clinical services. \"Some hospitals see these economic times as an opportunity to outsource unprofitable services,\" says Mr. Burchill. By outsourcing certain services to more efficient providers, hospitals can share the savings with the service provider. However, hospitals must be sure to select truly efficient providers. \"Outsourcing is clearly a smart thing to do if an organization can gain greater efficiency through finding a larger-scale operation; however the pro - vider must be more efficient than the hospital,\" says Kevin Haeberle, executive vice president, HR capital, for Integrated Healthcare Strategies. Oftentimes, hospitals outsource services such as laundry, food and nutrition, information technol-ogy or human resources because they do not have the capital to invest in the equipment upgrades or training that is needed to increase the efficiency of their internal service. In these cases, the decision to outsource may not directly be related to prof-itability but instead the \"lacking of funds for the investment required to make current services via-ble,\" says Mr. Haeberle. However, this decision can improve profitability in the long-run by allowing hospitals to use funds for more profitable services. Some hospitals have also begun to outsource clinical services such as emergency room staffing and anesthesiology in an attempt to become more efficient. Because these staffing groups employ a large number of specialty physicians, they may be able to provide more efficient services, especially in clinical areas that require around-the-clock cov- erage where the demand for services is high. Mike Mikhail, MD, vice president of client ser - vices for Emergency Physicians Medical Group, says that hiring an emergency department man- agement company can help to improve the prof- itability of hospitals whose demand for emer - gency services exceeds its emergency treatment capabilities. \"An emergency management group can help make the emergency department more efficient by introducing management oversight and best practices, allowing more patients to be seen and keeping others from leaving to find another hospital,\" he says. \"Because a majority of hospital admits come from emergency walk- ins, driving more patients through an ER will create more admits, and therefore more profit for the hospital.\" 6. Consider partnering with local physi- cians to reduce competition for outpa- tient cases. An increasing number of hospi - tals are joint venturing with local physicians and surgery center management companies to offer outpatient services through the development of a surgery center.

Mr. Walker reports that he has seen an increased interest from hospitals in joint venture arrangements for outpatient services. \"More and more hospitals are realizing that their core competency is providing inpatient care; their outpatient cases are more costly per case and take up more of the physician's and patient's time than they do at an ASC,\" he says. \"As a result, hospitals are competing with physicians for outpatient cases. Hospitals with joint-venture agreements, however, do not have to compete with the physicians.\" Hospitals can leverage their standing in the com- munity to partner with local physicians to share the revenue generated by efficient outpatient cases. \"We are in lean times, and lean times call for us to rethink our strategies,\" says Mr. Walker. \"It's better for physicians, hospitals and other groups to work together to provide an efficient delivery system for patient care than for the groups to compete.\" 7. Grow case volume by attracting new physicians to your facility. Identifying and attracting additional physicians to bring cases to your hospital is another way that hospital leaders can increase profits. Physician-owned hospitals can bring in additional physicians as partners, while other types of facilities can recruit new physicians who are willing to perform cases at their hospitals. \"New physicians will bring in more cases and grow your profits,\" says Ms. Worsham.Ms. Worsham suggests polling your medical staff for names of local physicians to target and inviting them into the facility. During the visit, Ms. Wor - sham recommends that hospitals work to \"wow\" the target physician. \"We work tirelessly to pro- mote the services we can offer them,\" she says. When a new physician begins performing cases at one of Ms. Worsham's facilities, that physi-cian is assigned a concierge. \"We have strong internal programs in place for this first day. A concierge is assigned to each new physician who provides them with a tour facility and walks them through every aspect of their day,\" says Ms. Worsham. 8. Consider adding profitable service lines. Hospitals may also be able to grow case volume and profits by adding new service lines. However, hospitals need to be careful to do their homework on the expected profitability and ROI for any new lines added, especially in a market where access to the funds required to invest in new service lines may be tight. \"You have to look at what the market needs are and where you're going to get the referrals from,\" says Ms. Worsham. \"Meet with local physicians and interview them about their needs and the number of cases they see that could utilize a new service.\" Hospitals should also be sure to examine the competitive landscape for any new service line. Ms. Worsham reports that her facilities have had great success from adding a hyperbaric service line because few competitor hospitals were of-fering this service. 9. Consider hiring hospitalists to man-age inpatient care. Hospitals that use hos- pitalists to care for patients can benefit from the more efficient care and better documenta- tion that specialized hospitalists can potentially provide. \"A protocol-based hospitalist program can in- crease efficiency and help to reduce the length of stay for patients, which can increase case vol- ume without the need for additional beds,\" says Mr. Kaufman. Hospitals should consider employing these special- ists as a means to improving care and enhancing their bottom lines, according to Mr. Kaufman. Stephen Houff, MD, president and CEO of Hospitalists Management Group, says that hospitalist groups can provide effective care to patients and possibly increase reimbursement. \"Hospitalists may be the most reliable and cost-effective means available for hospital lead- ers to transform medical delivery in their health system,\" he says. \"Through shared vision, an effective hospitalist team partners with hospital leadership to improve patient safety and access, streamline care, improve patient and family sat - isfaction, enhance reimbursement via improved clinical documentation and provide seamless transition to post-discharge care.\" 10. Renegotiate managed care con- tracts. One of the most important ways that hospitals can improve their profitability is by continually evaluating and renegotiating their managed care contracts. \"Hospitals must demand their fair share of premiums from third-party payors in order to subsidize the underpayment of Medicare and Medicaid,\" says Mr. Kaufman. \"Hospitals need to focus on reducing their cost structure as much as possible to approach breaking even with Medicare reimbursement rates, but that only goes so far.\" Mr. Kaufman recommends that hospitals only agree to contracts that reimburse at 130-140 percent of cost. \"If a facility is not big enough or strong enough to get these rates, then they should look at merging with a larger facility,\" says Mr. Kaufman. Ms. Worsham suggests that hospitals perform a profitability analysis by payor and by procedure in order to determine where a facility is losing money and identify any trends. She also suggests that hospitals evaluate older contracts due to changes in severity-based DRGs and carve out the reimbursement of implants in order to en-sure they are reimbursed appropriately for the costs associated with these. Ms. Worsham also suggests that hospitals evaluate contracts on a quarterly basis, even if the contract is not near expiring. She suggests that hospital \u0003 \u0003\u0003 \u0003 \u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003 \u0003\u0003 \u0003 Illinois 60154 708.492.0519 | www.medh q.net EMPLOYEE BENEFIT SOLUTIONS HUMAN RESOURCES PAYROLL ACCOUNTING REVENUE CYCLE CREDENTIALING Reduce Risk.

Are we being paid as agreed upon in the contract? Are we being paid in a timely manner? Contracts that are determined to be \"high risk\" should be renegotiated. Make sure your contracts contain a material harm clause, which will allow you to readdress terms of contracts that have become financially harmful to your facility, according to Ms. Worsham. Renegotiating contracts can be very valuable \u2014 one hospital Ms. Worsham advises will gain $500,000 this year due to renegotiations. Looking forward Hospitals that focus on enacting these best practices are likely to see im- provements in their profitability; however, hospitals can also benefit by using today's economic conditions as an opportunity to improve their over - arching approach to business, creating a more sustainable organization in the future. \"When profits were high, hospitals had the luxury of being sloppy in some areas; now we must run a tighter ship,\" says Ms. Floria. \"This will benefit the industry in the long-run.\" Hospitals can also use this opportunity to find creative solutions to prob - lems that plague their facilities. Goshen Health System, for example, recently enacted a program in which the hospital pays the premium required to sustain Cobra benefits for re- cently laid-off patients seeking care. \"We are willing to be creative with our patients,\" says Ms. Floria. \"We pay for benefits when certain patients cannot. The revenue we receive from caring for these patients recoups this cost and provides us with additional cash flows that likely would have been uncollected or written off to charity care or bad debt.\" This idea, which was enacted during lean times to improve profitability, will continue to benefit the hospital's bottom line, even when profitable times return. n Contact Lindsey Dunn at lindsey@beckersasc.com .

While the country's 1,000 healthiest hospitals remain stable, this remains a time of tremendous uncertainty and risk in the hospital industry. This article discusses five stra-tegic and development issues facing hospitals 1. Joint ventures of service lines Joint ventures can provide substantial benefits to hospitals. There are also severe limitations involved in the use of joint ventures. Jon O'Sullivan, senior principal and founding member of VMG Health, says, \"Physician/hospital joint venture relationships will continue to be a very im-portant part of the healthcare landscape. There are a number of market areas and strategic factors that will continue to drive these relationships.\" Mike Lipomi, president of RMC Medstone, agrees that now is an excel - lent time for hospitals to look into joint ventures. \"I think joint ventures will flourish in this difficult economic time,\" he says. \"Joint venturing with a specialized organization supports the focused factory theory of 'faster, better, cheaper.' In addition, the joint venture should result in lower costs, higher efficiencies and increased profitability.\" First, in terms of benefits to a hospital, a joint venture provides a means to develop congruent relationships with physicians. When both the hospital and the physicians have vested interests in a venture, it places the parties on the same page; both parties work together to control costs and achieve a profitable venture. It also avoids an employer-employee or boss-servant type of relationship. Moreover, joint ventures are often less expensive alternatives for hospitals to pursue. Primary alternatives in the past have included, for example, attempt - ing to control patient flow by employing significant numbers of primary care physicians and specialists. It has clearly proven expensive to employ and maintain a primary care-owned network. It is also proving difficult to main-tain productive specialists as employees of hospitals or health systems. A third key benefit to joint ventures is that a joint venture allows for greater freedom for both the hospital and the physician than the traditional em-ployer-employee relationship allows. For example, in a typical joint venture, a majority of physicians maintain an independent practice outside of the joint venture. This type of arrangement allows for congruency in the joint venture between the hospital and physician yet offers the physician a cer-tain amount of freedom outside the joint venture. There are also challenges and limitations to the use of joint ventures. For example, due to a number of business and regulatory issues, once a hos-pital invests in a joint venture it is often difficult to modify the number of partners or terminate the joint venture without suffering substantial dam-ages or losses. Surgery centers may also see the benefits of a hospital joint venture. Mr. O'Sullivan notes that as it becomes difficult for freestanding surgery cen - ters to maximize their revenue through an \"out-of-network\" approach, many of these centers will look to establishing relationships with their local hospitals. He says, \"As more and more managed care payors change their policy towards out-of-network centers, these centers will seek to enter into contracts with those payors in order to continue to serve their patients. Un - fortunately, many centers will find that these payors will either not contract with the center or offer a contract with very low reimbursement. These factors will spur many of these centers to joint venture with their local hospital partner who has both the ability to bring better reimbursement through their contracting ability as well as to bring more physicians who might increase the utilization of the center.\" 15 Popular Articles on www.HospitalReviewMagazine.com Here are just 15 of the most popular articles that recently appeared on www.HospitalReviewMagazine.com and in the Becker's Hospital Review E-weekly. 1.

For example, hospitals receive lower reimbursement if they choose to joint venture an ambulatory surgery center with their phy - sicians as opposed to simply receiving hospital-based reimbursement for an outpatient department. Thus, in addition to splitting the profits of the joint venture with the physicians, the venture as a whole will receive lower reimbursement then if operating as a unit owned solely by the hospital. Third, true joint ventures are not permitted in certain specialties for certain types of services. For example, it is difficult to joint venture various imaging modalities with physicians who are not radiologists. The Stark Act, which prohibits physicians from referring to an entity with which they have a fi - nancial relationship, classifies radiology and other imaging services as \"des-ignated health services.\" 1 A financial relationship is defined as any invest - ment, ownership or compensation relationship. Therefore, subject to a rural exception, a non-radiologist physician owner (for example, an orthopedist, a primary care physician or a neurosurgeon) may not invest in a joint venture and generally may only \"own\" and provide imaging services pursuant to the in-office ancillary services exception, which is a restrictive exception. 2 In ad- dition, states are beginning to limit ownership in imaging by non-radiologists as well. The Maryland Attorney General interpreted the state physician self-referral bill, which is similar to the Stark Act, to specifically exclude magnetic resonance imaging services, radiation therapy services and computed tomog-raphy scan services from the in-office ancillary exception. 3 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has expanded the list of Stark services to include nuclear medicine and positron emission tomography services. This would further limit the ability to enter into joint ventures for such services. There is also increasing scrutiny of imaging ventures set up as quasi-joint ventures as recently highlighted in national newspapers. 4 Mr. O'Sullivan says, \"The dual impact of changes in federal legislation, such as the Stark Act, will prevent certain relationships and increase the need for certain hospitals to implement 'game-changing' strategies in order to remain viable. In many cases, this strategy will take the form of a whole hospital joint venture. Additionally, the prospect of a change in law which might prohibit future or additional whole hospital joint ventures is causing many hospitals to accelerate their thinking of this strategic alternative.\" Fourth, a joint venture strategy is limited to certain physician specialists and is difficult to utilize for an entire medical staff. For example, the ben-efit of a joint venture \u2014 congruency between the hospital and physicians, controlled costs, vested interest in profits \u2014 becomes too diluted if too many physicians are involved in the joint venture. In short, a joint venture is useful to none if everyone is involved. This means that where a medical staff includes 200-300 physicians, a joint venture may ultimately be a useful option for a small minority of the whole staff. Mr. O'Sullivan also mentions how some specialty physicians may find the benefit in a hospital joint venture. \"Physicians in many specialty areas con-tinue to see their earnings erode. As a result, a plethora of relationships from radiation therapy to co-management agreements are continuously be-ing implemented to provide an ancillary form of income,\" he says. The role of joint ventures is likely to continue to evolve over the next three to five years. In general, joint ventures can be expected to proliferate for smaller types of service lines and services facilities, including ambulatory surgery centers, cardiac catheterization facilities and imaging facilities, among a hand-ful of other types of service lines and facilities. In contrast, joint venturing of many large scale projects is not expected. In essence, the development of joint venture specialty hospitals between hospitals and physicians is expected to some degree, and a smaller number of joint ventures of acute care general hospitals are expected between hospitals and physicians. 2. Landmines facing hospitals Many of the key problems that hospitals may face in the near future have not yet surfaced in part because hospitals are currently experiencing a favorable revenue and business cycle. This favorable business cycle has left many hos-pital systems insufficiently prepared for dips or downturns in the revenue and reimbursement cycle. Large national payors are pushing back with respect to climbing reimbursement and pricing. On a national level, there is discussion regarding the need to cut back or to reign in Medicare costs and the amounts paid to hospitals. If possible, the government may attempt to limit costs by decreasing reimbursement in niche areas where there is not as much political strength. Hospitals still must be prepared for changes in the revenue cycle. There are four specific concerns. First, hospitals have overleveraged themselves. This reflects several differ - ent characteristics. On one hand, hospitals remain confident in develop- ment plans and are regularly expanding and renovating hospitals to capture or maintain certain types of service lines and revenues. Overall health-care construction and commitments to construct increased dramatically from 2004-2008. Other entities are investing in information technology while others are pursing deals to merge. On the other hand, however, most hospitals, as not-for-profit, tax-exempt entities, are not forced to make distributions to shareholders. Because hospitals do not have to account to shareholders in that manner, it is easier to find opportunities to invest money in new programs and buildings, rather than prepare for the future by disciplined saving or repayment of loans. Many hospitals seem to have compensated for the recent economic down- turn by better managing their development plans. In a Jan. 2009 report on the financial health of U.S. hospitals and health systems, the Health- care Financial Management Association (HFMA) reported that 72 percent of hospitals surveyed planned to cut expenditures on new construction 12 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review E-Weekly at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 projects over the next three to six months; 37 percent planned to put a hold on all new con-struction projects. In addition, 77 percent of respondents planned to cut back on information technology expenditures. Second, a number of the nation's hospitals do not appear prepared for reductions and changes in reimbursement. Many hospitals have benefit - ed from increased Medicare reimbursement and a lack of payor discipline over the last few years. Payors are returning to the zero sum game ap- proach to negotiation efforts with hospitals. The health insurance industry is in a consolidation mode. This generally leads to greater power for the surviving payors and less negotiation lever - age for providers. As noted above, all hospitals must be prepared for a slow down in Medicare reimbursement increases and potential reduc - tions in payments from other payors. Hospitals are also experiencing an upturn in pa- tients seeking treatment who are not covered or covered by Medicaid or other public healthcare programs. A recent report from the American Hospital Association (AHA), The Economic Crisis: The Toll on the Patients and Communities Hospitals Serve, showed that 70 percent of the 1,078 hos- pitals surveyed reported an increase in uncom-pensated care. A further 46 percent reported an increase in patients on Medicaid or other public or low-income health programs. Third, many hospitals do not maintain sufficient reserves. Hospital margins are relatively nar - row. According to a MedPac report, there has been a decrease in hospital total margins. Total margin was measured by inclusion of all patient care services funded by payors, plus nonpatient revenues. In the aggregate, hospitals saw total margins decrease from 4.4 percent in 1991 to 3.4 percent in 2000. Given the small margins, insufficient reserves to cover losses can be prob - lematic when a hospital faces a downturn in the revenue cycle. 5 Many hospitals in this regard are facing large unfunded pension deficits. Additionally, the April 2009 HFMA Healthcare Financial Pulse report found that 54 percent of all hospitals surveyed reported a negative total margin. In the previous Jan. 2009 study, HFMA found that large to mid-sized hospitals were the most pessimistic about total margins over the next three to six months (35 and 43 percent, re-spectively). In the April report, 80 percent of the large (more than 500 beds) hospitals reported negative margins. Although the Jan. 2009 HFMA reported that hospitals were planning on cutting capital spend-ing and considering service cuts if necessary, there was no indication for a long-term solution if margins continued to decrease. The recent AHA report also showed that hos- pitals are experiencing a decrease in days cash on hand. Of the respondents, 59 percent ex-perienced a decrease in the amount of days the hospital could continue to meet its financial ob-ligations; of that number, 27 percent considered this decrease to be significant. Hospitals are also experiencing an increase in days in accounts receivable, further diminish-ing any reserve funds they may have. According to the AHA report, 36 percent of hospitals re-ported an increase in days in A/R as compared with last year. As a result of this loss of revenue, the report showed that nearly half of the 1,078 hospitals surveyed had reduced staff in response to the economic downturn. Eight of 10 had cut admin-istrative expenses, and one in five had reduced services, including behavioral health, post acute care, clinics, patient education and other services that require subsidies. Fourth, a number of hospitals consistently chase the \"next big thing.\" For example, the \"next big thing\" a few years ago was an expensive cardiac program. In many situations, the open heart pro - grams proved to be less profitable than expect - ed. This is, in large part, due to improvements in technology and decreases in the number of open heart surgeries performed. Currently, many hospitals are aggressively investing in different types of cancer treatment technologies and new types of buildings and development related to orthopedics and spine. However, if the number of admissions and procedures does not meet ex-pectations, or if reimbursement stagnates or de - creases, chasing \"the next big thing\" may lead to situations where the results for certain programs sorely miss expectations. In addition, hospitals are unprepared because the economic downturn is hitting them later than other industries. Mr. Lipomi says, \"I think the problems facing hospitals are the same prob - lems that all businesses are facing in today's eco - nomic crisis. The reason we are facing them later than most is that our industry is highly leveraged by insurance plans and managed care providers making us more of an economic anomaly. We face patients delaying procedures, resisting hos-pitalization and avoiding physicians' offices and the emergency room for fear of losing their jobs as well as inability to pay co-pays and deduct - ibles. In addition, the co-pays and deductibles are increasing rapidly as the employers are trad- ing premium dollars for higher deductibles.\" Mr. O'Sullivan sees hospitals as capable of han- dling the changes in the market and as even accus-tomed to facing these challenges. \"Unfortunately for weaker hospitals, these changes are part of an ongoing evolution of healthcare and often result in the demise of the weakest participants,\" he says. \"The upside is that the market is often better served as a result of revenue consolidation, great - er efficiency and rationalization of the delivery of care (two heart programs in a small market makes little sense). Hospitals will seek alternative mecha-nisms to survive and thrive in their markets. Some will sell, some will close and some will innovate. The difference will be the ability of management to face these challenges and propose solutions be - fore it's too late.\" Mr. Lipomi also sees government intervention as another potential hurdle for hospitals. \"We face the threat of government intervention to an even higher level than currently exists,\" he says. \"Threats of a national health plan and the elimi - nation of privatized medicine are on the mind of all healthcare providers. We need to take a close look at countries with national health plans and not only look at outcomes but look at the quality and availability of healthcare.\" 3. Financing vehicles Very healthy hospitals still face a plethora of op-tions as to how to finance their investments in facilities and programs. For hospitals in good fi - nancial shape, the choice of lenders, from tradi-tional commercial banks to private equity driven financing companies to publicly traded entities focusing on commercial and healthcare finance, is still significant. For a typical project, real es - tate or equipment driven, a hospital may choose to structure the project through either fixed or variable rate financing options, options not al-ways available in the past. These options often involve captive finance programs from the ven-dors themselves who may include large equip - ment companies or real estate entities or middle market lenders that focus on loans ranging from $10-$150 million. Mr. O'Sullivan says, \"Financing is very difficult in the current environment. The inability to gain access to capital will result in hospital sales to those entities that have greater access to capital. In the absence of a strong credit rating and bal- October 8-10, Chicago TO ReGisTeR, CALL (703) 836-5904 or go to www.ascassociation.org/ chicagoOct2009.cfm.

Certain of these new types of financing choices are intended to improve hospital/physician rela- tionships. For example, the use of participating bonds allows physicians and local community members to hold a part of the debt used by a hospital or a hospital project. It may also include, as noted earlier, the use of joint venture projects which enable participating physicians to share in the capital needs of a venture. In these situ - ations, the cost of these alternative sources of capital can be high in terms of the transaction efforts and fees. At the same time, these options offer a tangible benefit by helping to solidify relationships between physicians and hospitals. Accordingly, hospitals will often utilize a joint venture approach to financing projects even if it may be more expensive in terms of transaction costs and other types of challenges than doing the project alone. Participating bonds are used less often as the transaction costs for such prod - ucts have proven to be so expensive that many hospitals choose not to use participating bonds unless the project is of such size and scope that the cost will be relatively reasonable in compari - son to the total amount being raised. Over the next few years, financing options are expected to continue to proliferate until hospitals, once again, are faced with challenges relating to the financial performance of projects. The number of the nation's hospitals that are not in strong or even good financial shape has increased significantly in the last 12 months. Whether these hospitals are semi-rural or lo-cated in difficult urban environments, these enti - ties face a very significant increased struggle to find financing on any level. According to the Jan. 2009 HFMA report, both hospitals with limit - ed and broad access to capital saw increases in their debt (38 percent of all respondents) and increased difficultly securing other types of fi - nancing. Often when financing is available, it is available only at high rates and can be developed only to the extent that there are tangible assets available to serve as collateral for the financing. In contrast, healthy hospital systems can utilize their traditional cash flows and projected cash flows to help obtain financing. Overall, even though it is becoming more dif- ficult, hospitals are still able to access capital. In the AHA report, 45 percent of respondents said that their ability to access capital was getting worse; however, 51 percent reported that their access to capital was about the same. The report found that most hospitals could gain some type of capital, although they reported that it was somewhat to significantly harder to get.4. Hospital strategy for the next few years Hospital planning over the next few years should be driven by three conceptual strategic ap-proaches \u2014 an offensive approach, a defensive approach and an allocation method or approach. First, hospitals must play offense. This means constantly seeking new revenue lines. These can be \"home run\" profit lines, such as the efforts by many hospitals to develop oncology pro - grams or leadership in orthopedics or spine. In contrast, investing smaller amounts in a number of service lines as a way to increase profits and revenues has also benefited hospitals. This may include simply reinvesting in the three to five key programs the hospital sees as its most profitable or to add a few service lines. Second, hospitals must aggressively play defense. This means not over leveraging the hospital through excessive debt financing or overstaffing of certain programs. It also means preventing erosion of the hospital's revenue base by aggres-sively challenging or preempting joint venture efforts and market encroachment efforts by other hospitals and health systems. Finally, hospitals must adopt the concept of al- location as an overriding strategy. Too often, hos-pitals are significantly over-invested in one service line or one service category. Over the last few years, hospitals that have over-invested in certain types of service lines, such as surgical, imaging, oncology, orthopedic or neurosurgical, have per - formed very well. However, hospitals are better off allocating their risk by investing in several different service lines. In addition, hospitals must develop a service line or a specialty where they can become known and recognized as a key pro-vider in their community and become the distinct provider of choice. In essence, they must develop some specific reason for existence as revenue lines change and competition unfolds. Mr. O'Sullivan notes some of the issues when considering developing a specialty hospital. \"Mi-grating services to a specialized facility from an acute care setting is very difficult and can take years,\" he says. \"Importantly, if the opportunity for specialization exists, it will probably take form in a physician driving specialty strategy (heart hos- pital, short stay hospital, rehab, etc.). The most vi-able strategy for hospitals in the next five years is to capture market share through enhances rela-tionships with physicians. As such, hospitals are employing physicians at greater numbers, entering into co-management relationships and initiating joint venture strategies. The mix of these varies by market and market conditions.\" 5. Legal issues, congressio-nal attack and class action suits Not-for-profit hospitals are facing distinct at-tacks on several different levels. First, Congress has opened up an investigation as to whether hospitals are actually doing enough to earn and maintain their tax-exempt status. The Sen-ate Finance Committee has delivered extensive questionnaires to ten tax-exempt hospitals and health systems, seeking details on activities rang - ing from travel to compensation to charity care. 6 In addition, the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee has held a series of pub-lic hearings focusing on the tax-exempt sector, with particular focus on the not-for-profit, tax- 14 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review E-Weekly at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 exempt hospital.7 Second, many states and local communities are making efforts to try to reduce or erode tax exemption. In the long run it is expected that Congress will take little, if any, action to fundamentally change the way not-for-profit hospitals do business. As a business reality, not-for-profit hospitals are a huge employer in many places, and are vital to many communities. For example, in 2008, tax-exempt hospitals and healthcare organizations controlled approximately $490 billion in assets and received more than $500 billion in gross re-ceipts. 8 Further, the debt markets are extremely important to the national economy and provide great investment opportunities for a whole va-riety of participants. A challenge to the status of the tax-exempt entities that would result in a reduction of the supply of tax-exempt invest - ments would have a substantial impact through- out the country. While Congressmen may enjoy the investigative aspects of the effort to exam-ine the not-for-profit sector, any changes in tax exempt finance laws and how exempt hospitals function would have draconian and unexpected results throughout the healthcare economy and the national economy as a whole. It is expected, at some point, that politicians will use these types of investigations as a cover to wrestle with real and legitimate cost concerns of the Medi-care program. In essence, certain of the nega-tive aspects that come out of the Congressional investigations as to the tax-exempt sector may be used as tools and tactics to provide political cover and to ultimately reduce reimbursement to hospitals and health systems. However, some believe that Congress should examine problems within Congress before ad-dressing whether or not hospitals still meet tax-exempt status. \"I think Congress should examine Congress first,\" says Mr. Lipomi. He mentions plans like the current stimulus plan could encourage more people to spend money that they don't have and continue this cycle of economic downturn. \"This is a very dangerous situation that jeopardizes more than the future of healthcare,\" he says. On the state side, there will continue to be state- to-state skirmishes over issues related to the state tax and local tax exemption. This is particularly true in small communities where the hospital has evolved into one of the biggest employers, if not the biggest employer, and particularly if the community has lost some of its tax paying busi-nesses. For example, the Illinois Department of Revenue revoked the local property tax exemp- tion for Provena Covenant Medical Center in Urbana, Ill., following a determination by the local tax board that Provena was not a charitable institution because of the way it treated needy patients. 9 In essence, the manufacturing decreas - es in many communities and as the taxes are paid by such companies decrease as well, there will be more pressure on local communities to attempt to reap some tax benefits from their local hos-pitals. n This analysis examines five different issues that are facing hospitals and health systems throughout the country.

But the upper tier of American hospitals \u2014 those achieving top HealthGrades rankings and who crack the U.S. News & World Report's \"America's Best Hospitals\" \u2014 has remained there for years, carving longstanding reputations for quality that attracts the top physicians, nurses and patients from around the country and across the globe. Department leaders at three hospitals ranked in the Top 50 listing and an interventional cardiologist leading heart programs at two Chicagoland hos-pitals approaching that elite status say getting to the top is hard work, but there is a path and following it religiously will deliver better results and patient outcomes, even if it takes time to reach the top rung. Maureen Ogden of Tampa General Hospital Maureen Ogden, vice president of cardiovascular and transplant services for Tampa (Fla.) General Hospital, says 2009 was the first year the tertiary care hospital was ranked by U.S. News & World Report, which listed it as number 42 among the Top 50 heart programs nationally. Tampa General, a former public hospital that became a private, not-for-profit academic medical cen-ter affiliated with the University of South Florida in 1997, opened its Car - diovascular Center in Bayshore Pavilion in April 2008 for preoperative and postoperative patients. It features six cardiac cath labs and six interventional radiology suites within 77,000 square feet. Tampa General is the eighth busi-est heart transplant center in the country. Its stroke program has earned a five-star ranking from HealthGrades and its ventricular assist device program was certified with the Joint Commission's Gold Seal of Approval for quality. Ms. Ogden says the new facility is successful in part because the hospital involved physicians and staff in the design. Ms. Ogden, who joined the hospital in 1980 as a night nurse in cardiology and has worked there as a nurse, manager and director, says employee commitment and physician involvement are key to climbing the quality ladder. \"We have an amazing group of people who really care for the patients here,\" she says. \"Making the U.S. News & World Report list wasn't easy or fast. It's a very slow process. When we decided to build the pavilion in 2002, we committed to a new way of doing business. Our goal was to become the employer of choice, to recruit and train the best physicians, nurses and staff.\" She says being a regional organ transplant center is a big draw. \"We get re- ferrals from many smaller hospitals who don't feel comfortable with really complex patients. All that came together for us. We wanted to get Magnet certification and received it four years ago, which helps us recruit the best nurses. We wanted to receive Joint Commission disease specific recognition and we did. We wanted to work off of national benchmarks and we did.\" She says that Tampa General developed its own customer service program af-ter key staff underwent intensive training. \"We based our program on the Dis-ney model for customer services and created an educational process in which 100 percent of our staff was trained. We've seen perceptions change.\" She says achieving physician buy-in starts with recognizing physician needs. \"One of the things you have to do as a leader is to make yourself available at the time best for them. You can't schedule a meeting at 11 a.m., but at 5 a.m. or 7 a.m. You have to respect how valuable a doctor's time is and how difficult it is for them to find time. But physician involvement is critical,\" Hospital Cardiology Leaders Offer Practical Guidance for How to Make it to the Top of the Quality Ladder Written by Mark Taylor 18 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review E-Weekly at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 she says. \"You also must provide as much transparency as you can provide to achieve trust on both sides. Physician ease of practice is something we consider very carefully.\" She also suggests consistently seeking physician input and giving feedback. \"They need to be decision makers in the process. That's crucial to a cardi- ology department's success. We fully appreciate and value our physicians. They have choices and can take their patients elsewhere.\" Ms. Ogden says maintaining elite status is challenging. \"It's crucial to stay cur - rent with the science and technology and plan for it five years from now. Who's teaching me? My doctors. I seek them out and they keep me current.\" Joseph Butz of Sentera Norfolk General Hospital and the Sentera Heart Hospital Joseph Butz, vice president of the Cardiac and Transplant Program at Sen-tera Norfolk (Va.) General Hospital and the Sentera Heart Hospital, says that his organization's program unites a longstanding team of cardiac super specialists within an advanced facility \"built from the ground up for supe - rior cardiac care.\" Sentera was ranked 38th on the U.S. News & World Report Top 50 hospitals for heart care. Its Heart Hospital adjoins the level one trauma center and tertiary care hospital, Sentera Norfolk General, and offers an opportunity to house all cardiac services in one area to better focus cardiac patient care. The hospital achieved a ranking of fourth in the nation in mortality for cardiac procedures, with excellent quality outcomes. Mr. Butz points out that half of the heart hospital's volume comes from outside the Nor - folk market, serving populations in North Carolina, and Virginia's Eastern Shore and its Upper Virginia Peninsula. \"We defined success for our program to be in the top 10 percent in quality and we've achieved it in most areas,\" he says. \"We believe that good quality medi-cine is good business. If we can maintain our high quality rankings, we will con-tinue to draw business from outside of our market and do well financially.\" Mr. Butz says that the quality of clinicians draws referrals. \"Doctors don't want to refer their patients to physicians they don't think are any good,\" he says. \"The quality of those clinicians is important to insurers as well. That's really what makes a preferred hospital provider. Nursing competence is important as well. We've achieved status as a Magnet hospital. Finally, ef - ficiency is a big seller to physicians as well. At Sentera we do joint ventures that help align incentives and work towards a common goal. Physicians, staff and administration together drive quality. The dedication to doing the best medicine drives volume and cost effectiveness.\" He says at the Heart Hospital committees select and analyze data to inves - tigate trends and establish best practices and benchmarks. Mr. Butz says one means of achieving high levels of performance is to apply a program -matic approach to care, \"to hard-wire quality into everything. That's why the Cleveland Clinic, the Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins are always at the top. The program has to be hard-wired so it can survive the departure of an administrator,\" he says. \"I can leave tomorrow and this place will remain a Top 50 hospital. But just because it's hard-wired in doesn't mean it stays. Things change. There needs to be strong infrastructure in place to allow it to continue. You have to keep moving the bar forward. We are constantly looking at programs and making improvements.\" Mr. Butz says every healthcare market is unique. \"Hospitals need to figure out what their communities need and how best to meet those needs,\" he says, pointing out that not every community requires multiple tertiary referral centers. But every community has cardiac service needs and if a hospital is meeting those needs with a strong emphasis on quality, Mr. Butz predicts it will attract that next level of recognition. \"When your CEO says quality is the top goal and making it into the top 10 percent is the measurement, it gets you focused on the right thing, which isn't always volume or cost,\" he says. \"Physicians are instrumental, as is get - ting everyone on same page. Our physicians are very committed to making this program run better and if it runs better, everyone does better.\" Dr. Paul Jones of Mercy Hospital and Franciscan Physicians Hospital Interventional radiologist Paul Jones, MD, chairman of the department of cardiovascular services at Chicago's oldest continually operating hospital, Mercy Hospital, and medical director of cardiovascular services at Francis-can Physicians Hospital in Munster, Ind., says before hospital executives and their affiliated physicians consider expanding or consolidating heart services, they should crystallize their program's objectives and structure services not just for today's market, but tomorrow's. Dr. Jones says any new program needs to be in synch with the latest technological advances in cardiac care. \"Cardiology program planners should think ahead to make sure the pro - gram structures will be where the research and technology are going and the field of cardiovascular disease management is headed,\" he says. \"That's the value of cutting-edge interventional cardiology: having unique tools and some administrative skills to put those two together to structure pro - gram ready for what tomorrow's tech will look like.\" He says planning for the coming technology isn't enough. \"Programs must be quality-based from their inception. They must be structured and programmed with quality in mind and systems for evaluating quality outcomes.\" Dr. Jones says CMS and private insurers are increasingly tying reimburse- ment to quality outcomes through pay-for-performance incentives. \"That will become more and more prevalent,\" he predicts. \"The challenge in the years to come will be to convince hospital administrators to grow from a position of quality. I've been fortunate at Mercy and at Franciscan to have had that kind of support over the years.\" Mercy has a long history of cardiac quality. He says Mercy's heart program was ranked in Solucient's Top 100 hospitals and achieved status as a Blue Cross and Blue Shield center of distinction. Franciscan Physicians Hospital, a joint venture between the Mishawaka, Ind.-based Sisters of St. Francis Health Services and physician co-owners, is a relatively young hospital Dr. Jones says is quickly developing a reputa-tion for quality cardiac care. He says he was recruited to develop a cardiac program modeled after Mercy's at Franciscan. \"You have to be honest about the program's weaknesses and strengths and be clear what you want to achieve,\" he says. \"We've developed a continuous quality improvement model that allows us to look objec - tively at our problems and develop solutions. We want to foster a strong sense of teamwork. The strength of the program does not ride on the shoulders of a single individual, but the quality of the team assembled.\" Foundation Surgery Affiliates is a healthcare management organization specializing in project development, innovative facility design, partner recruitment and facility operations for surgical hospitals, bariatric hospitals and healthplexes, surgery centers and medical office buildings. www.foundationsurgery.com 19 Sign up for the FREE Becker's Hospital Review E-Weekly at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 He says he led efforts at Mercy to consolidate heart-related services, includ- ing cardiac surgery, into the department of cardiovascular services. \"From a hospital operational perspective it's easier to have of those ser- vices all under one umbrella department,\" he explains. \"It also makes us more accountable under our continuous quality improvement program. \"Our endovascular program has received national attention and we've cre- ated a program for physicians to train here to perform endovascular pro-cedures,\" he says. \"Everyone has to understand the true importance of that continuous qual- ity improvement program. People can get complacent about that,\" he says. \"But we cannot let our guard's down.\" Chris Thomson of The Christ Hospital's Heart and Vascular Center Chris Thomson, executive director Heart and Vascular Center at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, is a veteran hospital cardiology executive who has led 10 different programs in his career, most recently with St. Thomas Health Services in Nashville, Tenn. \"My career has been building heart programs,\" Mr. Thomson says. \"For collab- orative partnerships to work between physicians and hospital leadership there must be a true focus on patient care and quality. The rest of it just happens.\" Mr. Thomson says there are numerous effective process programs and ana- lytical tools that work. \"What it comes down to is how patients flow through your system and how you analyze that to improve care, how you work togeth-er to improve quality. It always comes back to personalities and a commit - ment to quality. Nothing will happen unless there is a commitment to quality. And people who focus on quality end up with fame and money.\"He concedes that some well-intentioned programs do not achieve success, usually because there was no common consensus or unity of vision. \"The reality comes when people don't want to change,\" he says. \"The world around us is changing and what worked in Nashville last year won't work in Cincinnati this year.\" He says the vision must be shared top to bottom. \"The person cleaning the cath lab is just as important,\" he says. \"If it's only the physicians and administrators, real success won't happen. If you ask the people delivering care what is the vision of the cardiac service line at Christ Hospital, they all can tell you it's quality outcomes, patient satisfaction and physician satisfac-tion. Everybody throughout the service line has to understand that. And if everyone is going in same direction, you can't help but succeed.\" Mr. Thomson says he's seen his share of \"one-hit wonders\" who appear on the top hospital lists one year and disappear after that. \"Someone came in and shook things up and got them going, but didn't drive down to the lowest level of people to make it stick,\" he explains. \"I can't fix things alone. I can lead toward the fix, but my job is to make sure everyone has the tools they need and understands where they're going. \"They need to bring in someone who makes sure they can follow up and maintain the progress. I'm a builder, not a maintainer. I build it and then move on. It's the responsibility of the builder to figure out how to maintain it and who would be best at that,\" he says, while conceding: \"People can only accept so much change before fatigue sets in. The key to all this is suc-cessful collaboration and agreement on the vision driven all the way down throughout the organization.\" n Contact becker@beckersasc.com Statistics on the Compensation of Physicians Here is a round-up of statistics on the growth and compensation of physicians. 1.

(Learn more about Ms. Hay on p. 23) Transparent is one word that has come to define David Fox, CEO of Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downer's Grove, Ill. While many leaders today put consid-erable effort into hiding their mistakes, and those of their organization, Mr. Fox believes that shar - ing and learning from these mistakes is the best way to improve a leader and an organization. Mr. Fox's unique approach to leadership is one reason why he has been selected as Becker's Hospi- tal Review 's Hospital CEO of the Year. Mr. Fox's transparent leadership style has proven to be extremely effective in improving clinical outcomes, and patient and employee satisfaction, within his facility. His commitment to sharing both his own and the hospital's performance informa-tion with hospital leaders, physicians and employees has also led Mr. Fox to be seen as an approachable leader who values the opinions of all hospital em-ployees and believes in the ability of everyone to make noticeable contributions to the hospital. One colleague praises Mr. Fox for this commit - ment to the staff. \"Dave Fox is known by his first name by many hospital workers, including mainte - nance, nursing staff and doctors,\" says a physician at the hospital. \"He conducts regular roundtable sessions, open to all, to discuss how to improve the hospital and to provide information. He is professional and accessible, a rare combination.\" Mr. Fox's commitment to his staff is apparent in the way he speaks of the successes of the orga-nization, stating that the recent accomplishments that the hospital has achieved, such as being named to Thomson Reuters' list of 100 Top Hospitals for 2008, would not be possible without the invalu-able effort that his staff puts forth every day. According to Mr. Fox, employees, or \"associates,\" as they are called at Advocate Good Samaritan, are one of the most important reasons for the hospi-tal's success. \"Our associates are one of our most valuable resources. We greatly value people who choose to work at Advocate Good Samaritan,\" he says. \"We refer to them as associates, not employ - ees, because of the symbolic partnership we see between them and the hospital as a whole.\" Mr. Fox's unique leadership style has gained him recognition within the healthcare industry. He was featured by the Health Financial Manage - ment Association in its 2008 Special Report for his transparent leadership style. Under his man-agement, Advocate Good Samaritan also earned the 2007 Lincoln Foundation for Performance Excellence Silver Award for \"Progress Towards Excellence,\" which honors outstanding perfor - mance by Illinois organizations. Mr. Fox has served as a healthcare executive his en- tire career. He earned a graduate degree from the University of Chicago in healthcare management and became the president of Central DuPage Hos-pital, located in Winfield, Ill., in 1997. He left Central DuPage to join Advocate Good Samaritan in 2003. Growing Advocate Good Samaritan The 340-bed Advocate Good Samaritan is af-filiated with more than 900 physicians and em - ploys more than 2,500 employees and is part of Advocate Health Care, the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in the Chicago area. The hospital scores consistently well on measures of clinical excellence as well as patient and em-ployee satisfaction, with Mr. Fox referring to 2008 as the hospital's best year in its 32-year history. The hospital received patient satisfactions score above the 90th percentile from four of the five patient groups it surveys and received employee and physician satisfaction rankings at the 93rd percentile. Additionally, the hospital experienced its best financial performance to date, with admis-sions growing 5 percent, and a net income of $20 million with an operating margin of 5.5 percent in a year where many hospitals did not fare as well. Mr. Fox's leadership is respected by colleagues and hospital staff.

Mr. Fox says that his primary job as a leader is to set the agenda for the organization and then help all associates understand, as they are called at Advocate Good Samaritan, understand their role in meeting the organization's goals. \"What I aim to do is take complex issues and translate them into relevant and actionable goals so that members of our organization under - stand how their role affects that goal,\" he says. \"My executive team and I spend a great deal of time formulating organizational goals, which then cascade down through our organization, so that every manager, and eventually every as-sociate, knows how his or her performance is judged,\" he says. Focus on benchmarking Mr. Fox's leadership philosophy, and, as a result, the goals that he sets for the organization are deeply rooted in the importance of measure - ment and transparency. \"You cannot improve what you cannot measure,\" he says. One indication of this commitment to measure - ment is the hospital's extensive use of perfor - mance data to set organizational goals.Mr. Fox regularly informs Advocate Good Samar - itan's staff about the importance of a measure - ment called the mortality index, which measures the number of deaths at a facility against the ex-pected number of deaths as judged by presenting patient acuity. Advocate Good Samaritan's index was determined to be 0.45, which means that only 45 percent of patients who were expected to die due to the severity of their presenting conditions actually passed away. In other words, Advocate Good Samaritan saved more than half of the pa-tients it was expected to lose during the year. Mr. Fox explains that these type statistics, while very useful, can be difficult for all hospital em - ployees to comprehend. He sees it as his job to translate these statistics into meaningful infor - mation for his associates. \"I translate these types of figures into something that makes sense, in this case, how many potential deaths were avoid-ed. Using this statistic, I was able to calculate that in 2008, 284 patients that should have died, statistically speaking, survived because of the great care we provide here at Good Sam.\" Mr. Fox believes that statistics and other measures of organizational and personal performance are the first step in improving the hospital. \"Measure - ments show you where you stand and can track your progress toward improvement,\" he says. \"Because we measure our performance and do so frequently, we are able to know throughout the year if a certain department or manager is not hit -ting a goal, and we can work with them early in the year to help ensure that the goal is met.\" Mr. Fox personally shares his monthly performance assessment with the entire board of directors, the hospital's management team and the leadership of the medical staff. \"It can be embarrassing if I have a bad month,\" he says \"But it ensures that I am ac - countable for the decisions I make.\" Great communicator Mr. Fox has been identified by his colleagues as a great communicator and leader. He is highly visible in the organization and meets each new employee that begins at Advocate Good Samari - tan during new employee orientation. \"Dave Fox is the most visible CEO I've ever met,\" says a colleague. \"He constantly commu-nicates with all levels of staff, holds associate forums and visits nursing units in which he de - scribes his own experiences in a caring and con-cerned way with the patients and staff.\" The employee forums that Mr. Fox hosts quar - terly are referred to as \"round the clock\" associ- ate forums. During the approximately 20 forums, which occur literally around the clock to ensure that employees from all shifts can attend, Mr. Fox responds to questions and concerns that hospital employees have and listens to suggestions from employees to improve the hospital. Colleagues of Mr. Fox say that his being a great listener is yet another reason why he is such an effective leader. \"He truly listens and has the interest and wellbe - ing of all [in mind]. Good Samaritan Hospital has improved 200 percent during his leadership,\" says a colleague. Associates also report that they feel valued by Mr. Fox and that their input effects the organization. \"Dave Fox has been an excellent president for Advocate Good Samaritan,\" says a colleague. \"He has always been sincere and has been able to engage the medical staff and understand their views and solicit their ideas ... He has worked very hard to earn everyone's trust and respect, and this helps define him as a great leader.\" Concern for people and financial performance Colleagues also tout Mr. Fox's knowledge of is-sues affecting hospitals in general. \"In my 30 years as a practicing physician, I have never worked with such a great hospital admin-istrator,\" says a physician affiliated with the hos-pital. \"Dave Fox has great in-depth knowledge of healthcare issues and a wealth of practical experience. He understands how to relate to people in all levels of the hospital and is able to accomplish things that transform the way people view their jobs. The result is better care for our patients and great pride in our hospital.\" Mr. Fox is also respected within the hospital for his concern for the financial performance of the facility. \"Dave does a great job balancing the very dif- ficult task of looking out for the staff at Good Samaritan Hospital and making the very tough financial decisions that have to be made at the present time,\" says a colleague. Mr. Fox reports that one of his primary objectives for 2009 is ensure good financials so that the hos-pital will not be forced to lay off any employees. \"My major priority for 2009 is to be proactive in managing expenses so that we can meet our fi - nancial goals without losing associates,\" he says. Mr. Fox also plans to continue to lead Advocate Good Samaritan toward outstanding clinical outcomes, patient and associate satisfaction and physician support in the coming year. Quint Studer, a healthcare veteran of more than 20 years and founder and CEO of Studer Group, an outcomes-based healthcare consult - ing firm, says, \"Dave Fox is a role-model health-care executive.

Special Report: Becker's Hospital Review 2009 CEO of the Year 21 \"In my 30 years as a practicing physician, I have never worked with such a great hospital administrator. Dave Fox has great in-depth knowledge of healthcare issues and a wealth of practical experience.\"Special Report: Becker's Hospital Review 2009 CEO of the Year 22 Creating an efficient and successful hospital environment requires more than oversee - ing day-to-day operations. It requires dedi- cation and a little creativity to change ineffective procedures into profitable ones for the facility. Joe Freudenberger, CEO of OakBend Medical Center in Richmond, Texas, uses his out-of-the-box ideas to improve operations and create a positive environment at the hospital. This creativity, among other reasons, is why Mr. Freudenberger is one of the runners-up for Beck- er's Hospital Review's CEO of the Year. OakBend Medical Center is a 184-bed acute care facility located in Richmond, Texas. It is the only Advanced Trauma Center in Fort Bend County and was recently awarded the Gold Seal of Ap-proval from The Joint Commission as a Primary Stroke Center. The organization has also partnered with M.D. Anderson Cancer Center to run a state-of-the-art radiation facility. Among other things, OakBend is known for Women's Services which include a birthing center and a Level 2 nursery, while its op-erating suites and imaging services have the most up-to-date equipment available. Taking a creative approach to management According to many of Mr. Freudenberger's Oak-Bend colleagues, he approaches management at the hospital with creativity and the enthusiasm to improve the hospital financially but just as importantly, to make OakBend an efficient and successful place to work. \"Joe is one of the most creative, physician-friendly CEOs I have seen in action,\" a colleague says. Another says, \"Joe is not afraid to make a de - cision or take chances and is willing to try new concepts and ideas. He is a positive thinker and believes things will always work out. He is also very open to listen to others and their ideas.\" Some other colleagues mention some of Mr. Freudenberger's unique ideas for improving op-erations at OakBend. \"...Joe is indeed full of creativity and energy and never gives up,\" one colleague says. \"He leads a great group of department directors who work extremely well with each other. Interestingly, an example of Joe's creativity is that some of his leadership team is related, not something most other CEOs would do, and he strongly believes this promotes loyalty, teamwork and community.\" Mr. Freudenberger describes his thought process when developing these out-of-the-box techniques by simply saying, \"If you aren't achieving your ob-jectives, you have to do something differently.\" He says that he'll throw out a radically different idea to his directors in order to \"get the creative juices flowing.\" \"You need to create energy to see how 'we can do it differently,'\" he says. \"Then you can see a way to change. Small steps might get you to where you need to be.\" For example, in order to address the high turnover rates in healthcare, Mr. Freudenberger considered what other organizations in the industry were do-ing. He came across Medline Manufacturing, a company that decided to keep the production of entire product lines within a single extended family. \"They found that family members do more to hold things together [in a company] than others,\" he says. \"They maintain a level of excellence and are better at internal discipline.\" After seeing this example, Mr. Freudenberger thought that it might be a good step for Oak-Bend to take, as noted by one of his colleagues. \"We ask our staff to recommend people they trust,\" he says of the hospital when trying to fill vacancies. \"Often times, they have family mem - bers who work out.\" As a result, the employee who recommended the family member does his or her best to ensure that the new employee is up to OakBend's standards. \"Their reputations are on the line,\" he says. \"They don't tolerate anything that will damage that.\" Establishing a presence on the floor Mr. Freudenberger says two of his other creative management ideas have come from an effort to be more visible in the various departments of the hospital. \"Visibility is important with the community and staff,\" he says. \"You have to get out there at times when people are available.\" For example, Mr. Freudenberger and several members of the executive staff held a 1 a.m. town hall meeting for night shift employees so this portion of the staff population could ex- press any concerns they had. \"Seven p.m. would have been convenient for me but not the night shift because that is when they are just beginning their shifts,\" he says. \"Instead, we asked them what time they preferred, and 1 a.m. did work. We had around 30 people come and talk with us. It was very productive.\" Another method Mr. Freudenberger has taken to increase his visibility and to motivate staff is to provide a quarterly cash bonus when financial goals are met. Every employee, from housekeeping to clinical staff, receives a $50 bonus if they make their budget each quarter. He makes an effort to personally hand each employee their bonus. Of this undertaking, one colleague says, \"While other bigger facilities in Houston have expanded into our market, Joe and his department direc - tors and board have found a way to thrive and exceed budget month after month. Employees look forward to him personally handing out new $50 bills when budget is beat. Joe values Oak- Bend's employees first of all, and it shows!\" Mr. Freudenberger uses this face time to see how his staff is handling the different issues of the day, such as questioning staff on patient safety goals. This was one technique he used in prepa- ration of The Joint Commission survey. \"[Asking questions] helps to emphasize quality,\" he says. \"I can see if the staff is focused and how they answer questions under pressure so they were prepared for the surveyors.\" This technique paid off. The Joint Commission surveyors commented that \"OakBend was in- credible\" and that the staff was \"friendly, knowl - edgeable and did the right things consistently.\" Financial success In addition to his successes with personnel, Mr. Freudenberger has seen financial success and growth over the past year at OakBend. One col-league says, \"Joe has turned this organization around both culturally and financially in just one year. He is dedicated, focused and an excellent leader. What we have accomplished in the last year could not have been done without his leadership.\"Joe Freudenberger, Runner-up for Becker's Hospital Review's Hospital CEO of the Year By Ren\u00e9e Tomcanin Special Report: Becker's Hospital Review 2009 CEO of the Year 23 Creating an atmosphere of transparency, hones- ty and collaboration is what he attributes to this success. Regular communications with employ - ees \u2014 letters, town hall meetings, making the rounds \u2014 has helped the staff to see what their targets should be and feel proud of their own ac-complishments as well as the hospital's. \"Employees should take pride in their work and not just see it as a paycheck,\" Mr. Freudenberger says. By building a culture of collaboration, he says that OakBend has been able to succeed in this tough economy. \"It is easier to build volume than to cut costs,\" he says. \"We try to maintain a high level of quality and customer service, and then we ask physicians to bring in patients. People do respond to these re - quests. Physicians are pleased when they are asked to bring in business to help the hospital succeed.\" A 'can-do' attitude Many colleagues note Mr. Freudenberger's can-do attitude. One says, \"Joe has demonstrated strong vision and leadership. He is a 'make it happen' CEO with excellent business and market knowl-edge. Joe has a proven track record of success.\" Mr. Freudenberger works to find time to speak with the organization's entire staff about the crit - ical importance of dedication to excellence. \"This is a conversation I have with everyone,\" he says. \"You can do anything if you are committed. I tell my children, 'If you want the A, you must put in more effort.\" This perspective extends to his professional life. \"I will not accept 'no' as an answer,\" he says. He says that he will accept \"I'm not willing\" as an answer, because that means a person won't put in the effort required to accomplish a task. How - ever, in his opinion, \"'I can't' doesn't exist.\" As a result of this \"make it work\" philosophy, OakBend is experiencing extensive growth and is expanding to a second campus this year which will feature full service inpatient care as well as a third campus dedicated to comprehensive outpa-tient services in Fort Bend. This is impressive, especially since other hospi- tals across the country have halted or postponed expansions. using past experience as a guide Mr. Freudenberger's background is in business in finance. He graduated with a bachelor of science in mathematics and economics from Tulane Uni - versity in New Orleans and received his MBA in finance from Tulane's Freeman School of Busi - ness, where he graduate cum laude. Prior to becoming CEO at OakBend, Mr. Freudenburger severed as a CFO and a COO at another location. Mr. Freudenberger's experience as a CFO has helped him to become a successful CEO. \"So much in healthcare is tied to financials,\" he says. \"If you don't understand it, you can't come up with and execute solutions. I am able to make quick and efficient decisions.\" In addition, Mr. Freudenberger's experience as a COO has helped him see that \"it's more than dollars and cents that drive a hospital,\" he says. \"It helped me to see the physician view of operations.\" Pride in your work Most of all, Mr. Freudenberger says that he tries to enable his employees to feel proud to be a member of the OakBend family. \"I brag about OakBend all the time to them,\" he says. \"But I also look for op- portunities to say, 'You're doing a great job!'\" By using creative and unique approaches to problem solving, being visible in the hospital and making staff enthusiastic about being a part of the hospital, Mr. Freudenberger has been able to bring success to OakBend. As one colleague says, \"Joe's leadership, experi- ence and commitment have helped our hospital grow and succeed.\" n Contact Ren\u00e9e Tomcanin at renee@beckersasc.com.\"Joe is not afraid to make a decision or take chances and is willing to try new concepts and ideas. He is a positive think - er and believes things will always work out. He is also very open to listen to others and their ideas.\" Working well with staff and patients at a hospital is one of the essential steps in ensuring the success of the facility and is a great ability for a CEO to possess. Debbie Hay, president of the Texas Institute for Surgery in Dal-las, is one hospital leader who embodies this ability. In addition to establishing a great relationship with all who work and visit her hospital, Ms. Hay's strong leadership has led to her being vot-ed as one of the runners-up for Becker's Hospital Review's Hospital CEO of the Year. Ms. Hay oversees operations at the Texas Institute for Surgery, a surgical specialty hospital that primar - ily performs surgical and pain management proce - dures. The hospital contains a nine-bed inpatient unit, nine ORs and three specialty treatment rooms. Among its top surgical specialties are orthopedics, pain management and ENT, according to Ms. Hay. Creating an environment of respect When describing Ms. Hay's great leadership, one of her colleagues says, \"Debbie Hay serves gal-lantly as president of this small specialty surgical hospital. Her executive leadership skills are great. She's innovative, flexible and always has the hos-pital and its employees as her first priority.\" Another commends Ms. Hay, saying, \"Debbie Hay [is an excellent leader] because of her pro - fessionalism, quality of care for the facility and employees and patient care. She is personable, Debbie Hay, Runner-up for Becker's Hospital Review's Hospital CEO of the Year By Ren\u00e9e Tomcanin Special Report: Becker's Hospital Review 2009 CEO of the Year has great character and has a spirit of excellence. She brings out the best in others.\" Ms. Hay is modest about her management style, saying that she simply treats everyone equally by being \"fair, honest and supportive with people.\" This approach to management has led many who work at the Texas Institute for Surgery to see Ms. Hay as an effective leader. For instance, a colleague says, \"She always has a willing spirit, will get in there no matter what the department is and get things done and help out when there is a short staff situation. She is very professional, smart and witty and always has an 'open-door policy' to come to her with whatever is needed.\" Ms. Hay notes that while she does have an open door, she encourages her staff to use the proper chain of command when they have an issue. \"I am available when a staff member feels their concerns aren't being addressed,\" she says. Always willing to lend a hand Before coming to the Texas Institute for Sur - gery, Ms. Hay has served as the administrator of a surgery center, an ER nurse and manager and has more than 30 years' nursing experience. This clinical understanding is clearly an asset to her when addressing staff problems. Ms. Hay credits her background with helping her to work more effectively with the hospital staff. One colleague says, \"She is uniquely qualified for her position with the vast years of clinical and administrative experience. Her past experience in the OR raises her credibility with surgeons and staff alike.\" \"It helps to boost staff and physicians confi - dence,\" Ms. Hay says. \"I can discuss clinical is- sues, understand and help resolve them.\" Ms. Hay makes sure to commit a significant amount of time in the departments and areas of her hospital. \"I frequently ask questions when I'm in the department,\" she says. \"You can find out things that you may not know otherwise.\" Often, this helps her to address problems be- fore they become bigger issues and allows her to bring these concerns up with department man-agement. You can often find Ms. Hay lending a hand in departments that need her, as her colleagues mention. Using her experience as a registered nurse, she is not afraid to step in and assist with the clinical side of the hospital She also helps out on the business side of opera - tions. She doesn't consider this anything out of the ordinary. \"I help out wherever I can to fulfill the needs of the hospital,\" she says. \"In orientation, I tell every employee that there is no task that is 'not in my job description.' I include myself in that statement. If they need me to serve food in the cafeteria or assist in the clinical area, I'll do it because there is a need.\" She sees the benefit in spending times in differ - ent areas of the hospital. \"By helping out, I'm supporting the fact that we need to have respect for one another's job responsibilities,\" she says. Going green One of Ms. Hay's major projects over the past year has been to encourage her hospital to \"go green.\" A colleague says, \"In addition to electronic med - ical records, she has speared an amazing effort to 'green' the Texas Institute for Surgery facility \u2014 she personally started the effort, and today the program is widely embraced by TIS employees who recycle just about everything possible and has become a model for other hospitals in our area.\" Ms. Hay's green campaign consists of \"a lot of little things\" that a hospital can do. Some of her \"little things\" include adding new ground cover and planting trees on the hospital's grounds, converting to EMS, using green house - keeping supplies and monitoring the use of elec - tricity around the facility. This latter technique includes automatic light sensors that shut off the lights and adjusting temperatures in specific areas when they are not in use. In addition, Texas Institute for Surgery uses green couriers who drive hybrid cars or use bikes if they are close-by.Ms. Hay's biggest effort when it comes to her green campaign has been in recycling. \"The hos-pital environment is a huge waster of resources because we use so many disposable things that are thrown away,\" she says. Her hospital uses a single-stream recycling com- pany that doesn't require them to separate their recyclables. Texas Institute for Surgery recycles everything from bottles to IV bags to tubing to paper products. \"It's had a big impact and has taken the most effort,\" she says. Maintaining an excellent staff Ms. Hay has also managed to maintain an ex-tremely high staff retention rate at her organi-zation. One colleague puts the number near 95 percent. \"Our facility attracts great physicians and staff in large part due to the leadership that Ms. Hay has established,\" the colleague says. Ms. Hay says that it is important for the staff to know that they have someone within the hospi-tal who will listen to their concerns. \"Finding a good staff that works well togeth- er and fits well within the organization has been essential,\" she says. She notes that although an employee may be a good worker, it is important that he or she works well with the rest of the staff and within the culture of the hospital. \"Money doesn't solve all problems,\" she says, in regards to creating an excellent team. \"You have to acknowledge situations and be strong enough to say to a person, 'You aren't a good fit.'\" Ms. Hay notes that the process of creating a good team doesn't happen overnight, but work-ing diligently to do so does pay dividends. According to a colleague, patient satisfaction at the Texas Institute for Surgery is \"consistently more than 95 percent,\" which Ms. Hay attributes to assembling an excellent staff. \"It's the people who maintain patient satisfac - tion,\" she says. \"A compassionate staff makes patients feel like they are listened to and cared for, and leads to exceptional care.\" These many factors have helped the hospital to grow in spite of the current economic situation, and Ms. Hay can't attribute the success to any one element. \"We have an outstanding group of physicians and physician-owners who are concerned with the safety, well-being and happiness of the pa-tients and the staff,\" she says. \"Everyone is on n Contact Ren\u00e9e Tomcanin at renee@beckersasc.com.24 \"[Debbie Hay] always has a willing spirit, will get in there no matter what the department is and get things done and help out when there is a short staff situation.
