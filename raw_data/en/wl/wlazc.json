Summaries Of The News: [ White House Targets Costly Health 'Facility Fees,' Short-Term Insurance ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/white-house-targets-costly-health-facility-fees-short-term-insurance/) News outlets report on new efforts from the Biden administration to lower health care costs, this time by tackling surprising billing items like expensive hospital \"facility fees,\" and also to limit short-term health insurance plans, which the president likened to a \"scam.\" [ Stat: Biden Targets Hefty Hospital 'Facility Fees' That Often Surprise Patients ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/07/hospital-facility-fees-biden-initiative/) As part of the Biden administration's broader efforts to lower health care costs, the White House announced new guidelines on Friday targeting a few of the most common sources of sticker shock. The new policy initiatives target some of the usual suspects: surprise billing, which was restricted in 2020 yet persists as health care providers exploit loopholes; short-term insurance policies that often fail to cover essential treatment; and high-interest credit cards and payment plans especially marketed to help patients cover medical debt.

Dowd in 2019 purchased a high-deductible health care plan when he returned stateside after serving in the Peace Corps in Ghana but before he started graduate school and was able to get on a student health plan. He thought the plan would protect him in the case of a medical emergency. But just weeks before he started school, he had to have emergency surgery to remove his appendix. Months later, the hospital called him to tell him his insurer would only cover a small portion of his bill and that he would have to pay more than $37,000 out of pocket.

Perhaps by design, it's not always clear who's sponsoring the ads or why. Or, for that matter, why now? The short answer is that Congress is paying attention. House and Senate members from both parties have launched at least nine bills, parts of which may be packaged together this fall, that take aim at pharmacy benefit managers, companies that channel prescription drugs to patients.

Their claim, detailed Friday in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, obtained by CBS News, follows a monthslong probe led by Rep.

[ Stat: Medicare Wants To Send $9 Billion To 340B Hospitals ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/07/medicare-340b-9-billion/) Medicare is planning to send $9 billion in lump-sum payments to more than 1,600 hospitals that participate in a drug discount program after the Supreme Court found the program underpaid them for prescription drugs, the agency announced on Friday. To pay for the restitution, Medicare would slash all hospitals' payments for other items and services by 0.5% for the next 16 years. (Cohrs, 7/7) [ Stat: Home Health Providers Sue Medicare Over Payment Cuts ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/07/home-health-lawsuit/) The National Association of Home Care and Hospice sued the Biden administration to halt the government's recent proposed rule that would cut Medicare payments to home health agencies by 2.2% in 2024. Since 2020, Medicare has updated its system for how it pays for home health, in particular by basing payments less on how much therapy someone is getting at home. By law, the new system can't cost more or less than it otherwise would have, but Medicare reinforced this year that it had \"paid more under the new system than it would have under the old system\" \u2014 and thus continued cuts to home health for next year.

Enrollment in the health program for the low-income and disabled grew to 95 million during the pandemic, as states stopped checking to make sure people were eligible. Now states have started checking again, and more than 1.6 million people have been kicked off the program in the past three months, according to KFF, a health-analysis foundation. Federal regulators estimate that 15 million to 17 million people will eventually be pushed off Medicaid.

Thousands of Floridians have been disenrolled from Medicaid since the state began redetermining eligibility in May, after a federal directive that states suspend such efforts during the pandemic was lifted.

A little more than half of Medicaid recipients who lost coverage \u2014 48,857 \u2014 were removed because the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare either could not contact them or the Medicaid enrollees didn't give the agency the information to prove their eligibility, department spokesperson Greg Stahl told the Idaho Capital Sun in an email.

As the lead degrades, it is ending up in places where Americans live, work and play. The lead can be found on the banks of the Mississippi River in Louisiana, the Detroit River in Michigan, the Willamette River in Oregon and the Passaic River in New Jersey, according to the Journal's tests of samples from nearly 130 underwater-cable sites, conducted by several independent laboratories. The metal has tainted the soil at a popular fishing spot in New Iberia, La., at a playground in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., and in front of a school in suburban New Jersey.

Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper said the legal language in the ban doesn't use the term \"abortion\" so the law only prohibits attacking a woman in an attempt to kill her unborn child.

The proposed measure is similar to a 2018 law that a deadlocked state Supreme Court declined to reinstate last month, prompting Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds to call for the extraordinary session.

New York lawmakers have, in two consecutive sessions, passed the New York Equal Protection of Law Amendment, which would ban a wide range of discrimination based on sex, expressly including sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. It would also ban discrimination based on age, disability, ethnicity and national origin and establish a constitutional right to abortion and other reproductive health care.

The claim also ignores that both countries have participated in coerced abortions for their own goals \u2014 something that U.S. abortion policy doesn't come close to permitting.

His death comes after 40 years of intense scrutiny from law enforcement, in which Lewis played a cat-and-mouse game with investigators.

Given how difficult it can be to identify and diagnose, the incidence rates among those exposed to multiple viral infections may be much higher. Long COVID symptoms, such as fatigue, difficulty breathing, and brain fog, can significantly interfere with one's quality of life. Emerging studies now suggest that many of these symptoms may be a consequence of damage to the vagus nerve. As the body's primary communication superhighway, the vagus nerve extends into every major organ in the body, including the heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.

EDs are designed to treat physical traumas and are ill-equipped to provide regular care for people with mental illnesses.

In 14 states, these councils have the ultimate say on the money, which comes from companies that made, distributed, or sold opioid painkillers, including Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, and Walmart. In 24 other states, plus Washington, D.C., the councils establish budget priorities and make recommendations. Those will affect whether opioid settlement funds go, for example, to improve addiction treatment programs and recovery houses or for more narcotics detectives and prisons.

The shortage, announced by the drugmaker Pfizer in a letter last month, involves Bicillin L-A, a long-acting injectable antibiotic also known as penicillin G benzathine.
