[ LEARN MORE MAKE APPOINTMENT](HYP_SCH.html) United Presbyterian Church, 109 Seaside Avenue Milford CT. No experience needed. I have been to many different energy healing workshops, lectures and wellness centers, but after taking several classes with Chantal I can honestly say that I gained the most from the insights and expertise I gained through the IEM Institute courses. I have taken all of IEMI classes from Chantal. She is a caring, talented, and knowledgeable teacher. Reiki 1, 2, & 3 and Shamanism 101 were \"live classes\" all the others were Zoom classes. Each class taught me so much; always building on what I had learned in a previous class. I was delighted how wonderful this experience was in terms of education and value. I highly recommend taking a class that resonates with you, either in person or via Zoom. There is not a day that goes by that I am not thankful for Chantal - this incredible beautiful soul, teacher, healer, educator for all the love and patience and guidance and her providing the tools for me to be healthy happy and whole. I gained with this program the confidence, knowledge and ability to now work with my own clients and I will continue to take class from her and pick her brain as much as possible. If you want to change your life or career I recommend the IEM Institute's program. The IEM session did have significant benefits. When I first got in the car to drive home my right hand was almost completely numb. By the time I drove past Milford Hospital all sensation had come back. Hours later I noticed that I could make a complete fist with my right hand - something I have not been able to do in a year. Amazingly I can still do it two days later! FOLLOW-UP SESSION: Today's session was unbelievably trans-formative. I haven't felt this alive and awake in years. A foreign feeling of peacefulness and relaxed in my own body has overtaken me! Thank you for taking all the extra time today to send me out the door in complete harmony with myself. Dream Therapy Zoom class has to be one of my favorite classes so far. The depth we were able to go in our dreams and in everyone else's was amazing. This class taught me to look at dreams in new ways, to journey into them, to pick different avenues to walk down. I found the healing aspect of dream therapy to be a very useful tool. I would highly recommend this class. I took Chantal's Reiki 1-2-3 classes and decided to take Acupressure. It really complimented what I had learned in Reiki. Taking a class with Chantal is always enlightening and leaves me feeling like I've learned a valuable lesson I will always carry with me. She is truly a brilliant teacher. You will not regret taking a class with her. Thank you Chantal for everything you do! I can tell you are meant to do this incredible work! \u2014 Shenisse Marrero My Soul Centered Hypnosis' experience with Chantal exceeded my expectations. She is a unique healer, intelligent, knowledgeable, kind and patient. My first hypnosis ever and I felt completely safe and taken care of. Chantal is the type of practitioner one can only hope to come across in a lifetime. Thank "}
