BEAUTY PRODUCTS: What could be a more sustainable and intimate choice than REAL ROSES in Dr. Hauschka products on [BewellwithAIM](https://bewellwithaim.com/search?q=dr%20Hauschka)! Dr. Rudolph Hauschka founded Hauschka Skin Care as a means to support the healing of humankind and the planet. In 1929, he achieved success in creating a water-based extract of rose petals that remained stable without the use of alcohol or preservatives. That very extract (or \"mother substance\") remained stable for more than 30 years. Hauschka nourished a small collection of beautiful botanicals built around water extracts of damask and Bulgarian roses. Because the rose essence sustained within has such a high level of purity and quality, it confers a healing benefit making these beauty products as much therapeutic as cosmetic. Rose petals contain polyphenols, organic compounds that contain a high amount of pigment or color. These act as antioxidants that work to protect your body from cell damage. They act as a natural sunscreen, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging. As an antiseptic and antimicrobial, rose topically can help fight acne, soothe dermatitis, and is helpful with eczema and psoriasis. The smell of roses helps to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and calm the senses.

Rose Quartz, with its gentle pink essence, is a stone with an affinity for the heart and for the breast. It carries a soft energy of compassion and peace, tenderness and healing, nourishment and comfort. Many ancient cultures use rose quartz to activate the heart energy. In India, rose quartz speaks directly to the Heart Chakra, dissolving emotional wounds, fears, and resentments, and circulates a Divine loving energy throughout the entire aura. Reawakening the heart to its own innate love, it provides a deep sense of personal fulfillment and contentment, allowing one the capacity to truly give and receive love from others. In ancient Western cultures, Celtic, Norse, and others, Rose Quartz was used as a love token even as early as 600 B.C. It was effective in attracting new love, romance, and intimacy, or in developing a closer bond with family or friends. In ritual, it was used to support connection within groups and communities and carries a high spiritual attunement to the Earth, Universe, and the Divine. Prized in the ancient African world for its powers of physical beautification, facial masks of Rose Quartz have been recovered from Egyptian tombs, thought by the Egyptians to clear the complexion and prevent wrinkles. Rose Quartz was considered a personal totem in Africa. It inspired the love of beauty, in oneself and others, in nature, and especially that which stimulates the imagination...art, music, and the written word. In ancient Eastern cultures, particularly in Tibet and China, it was one of the major carving stones. The Chinese used quartz in various types of pastes, powders, and solutions for topical application for soothing and cleaning the skin. We obtained these small rose quartz hearts from a highly reputable small craftsman. They fit nicely into an undergarment or bra where they warm against the skin and help to integrate healing energy into your life post-radiation, pre or post-surgery, or in survivorship. They are a wonderful gift for you to purchase for yourself or for your loved ones. Dr. Roy wears one close to her heart daily in practice and often recommends them to patients to use in their undergarments after their daily radiation. These are $8 each and can be purchased [here](https://bewellwithaim.com/products/rose-quartz-heart-crystal?_pos=1&_sid=bbf7f2e33&_ss=r). TEAS: We also have a limited supply of PUKKA teas in the office. Taken orally, the same rose polyphenols that support the skin topically, have been shown to reduce the risk of: Heart disease Diabetes Obesity Cognitive diseases PUKKA is now available over the counter so we no longer have access to it wholesale. We LOVED PUKKA because of the company's focus on organic farming, fair trade, and conservation through commerce. Every Pukka plastic-free tea bag comes in its own recyclable envelope to retain the essential oils in their ethically sourced 100% organically grown herbs. Each bag has two cloth chambers, allowing these incredible herbs to flow and release the full potency in your cup. We have limited availability at the reduced cost of $9/box of: After your valentine's dinner is a non-caffeinated \"coffee-like\" drink that is made with organic aniseed, cardamom, chicory, fennel, ginger, and licorice. It's a wonderfully sumptuous tea for soothing digestion after your meal. Beyond the chatter, steam rises, and mugs are stirred. First, the luxurious taste of roasted chicory. Next, the calm of cardamom mingling with aniseed, followed by sweet fennel and licorice. One slow sip follows another. These herbs are all heart and immune supportive. Relax: Sweet fennel seed (24%), chamomile flower (18%), licorice root, flowering tops, cardamom pod, ginger root, marshmallow root (10%). Made with organic chamomile flower to help you to unwind and fennel seed and ginger to ease digestion. This tea is meant for relaxation, it's lovely right before bed or an intimate moment, especially for patients who struggle with anticipatory anxiety before sex, or anxious rumination before bed. It's excellent before difficult conversations and the fennel and ginger are heart and immune supportive. Love: Chamomile flower with rose hips, organic chamomile, elderflower, lavender, licorice, limeflower, and marigold. This tea is excellent for patients with a risk of cardiotoxicity but also a delicious gift for Valentine's Day. Herbs may feel like gentle warriors, but brewed correctly and taken consistently, they can be life-changing. Rose is excellent for vessel damage and heart health and lavender and chamomile are wonderful for hypertension. Three Mint: Peppermint leaf (34%), spearmint leaf (34%) fieldmint leaf (32%). This tea is a blend of three types of mint for a vibrant cool and supreme sweetness. Like a natural bubblegum, this tea is a cooling digestive that also supports the respiratory system and immune health. Three Fennel: Sweet fennel seed (50%), wild fennel (bitter fennel) seed (45%), fennel leaf (5%). Fennel was highly valued in the ancient world by Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese, and Indians for its value as a carminative, expectorant, and as a talisman used in various rituals. Due to fennel's gentle nature, it is used to support digestion in infants and children and can be given to nursing mothers. It prevents heartburn and is an underrated immune supportive. Like the Three Mint and After Dinner, it's lovely digestive after a rich meal. Cinnamon: Vietnamese cinnamon bark (60%), Indonesian cinnamon bark (16%), licorice, Indian cinnamon bark (10%). This is Dr. Roy's favorite. The taste is sweet and spicy. Cinnamon is heart supportive. To extract the organic compounds that are medicinal, a tea needs to be steeped for quite some time. At least 5-10 minutes for flavor and overnight for therapeutic healing. This tea just gets better with steeping time. Revitalize: Cinnamon bark (25%), bud, black peppercorn. This is Dr. March's favorite. It is a \"mother tea\" that blends many of the herbs in the teas above.
