Author Unknown, quoted in Quotations for Special Occasions by Maud Van Buren, 1938 I began this journey out of a deep desire for connection with spirit. I did not know how to do this, yet I followed an intuitive thread towards my own heritage from the British Isles. I chose books that might inform me. I held ceremonies that honored the full moon for a year, then the new moon for a year, and then the Celtic holidays for a year. Finally, I took on the ceremonies for each month of the Celtic tree calendar. I am so grateful to the men and women who came to my ceremonies and classes. I taught what I hoped to learn about, and I received more than I could have ever imagined. My greatest gift came as a knowing in my bones that other dimensions of love and light are available to us. I have experienced and seen miracles. I am grateful to my many teachers, especially Starfeather, Starhawk, Diane Stein, Brooke Medicine Eagle, Vicki Noble, Danielle Rama Hoffman, Ffiona Morgan, Barbara Walker, Zsuzsanna Budapest, and Nicki Scully. I want to thank my very first little circle with Beth Johns, Alice Quintance, and Margery Hite. Thank you to Gloria Taylor Brown and her channeling of Thoth, which prompted me to complete this book and get it to my publisher. I want to thank my husband, Ricardo Hidalgo, and my children, Eli (Cairn) Werner-Limardi and Rianna Hidalgo, for their willingness to share our home so that I could teach classes and run ceremonies. This was no small sacrifice on their part. I want to thank all of my incredible nieces for their love and support as well. I want to thank my first women's circle who met monthly for years: Nancy, Karen, Linda Sue, Deborah, Gina, Jennifer, Donna, and Willa. Thanks to my healing circle of Maxine, Colleen, Karen, Starfeather, Maggie, and Teresa. I am grateful to the men and women who came to my Celtic holiday ceremonies. Thanks too to the friends, acquaintances, and students who came to my tree circles, and thank you to all the women who attended my workshops in California, Oregon, and Seattle. I want to thank Julia Adame, Connie Vierling, Jennifer McClure, Starfeather, Beth Johns, Karen Johansen, Willa Werner, and Sandy Nisley-Leader for their continual support and encouragement over the years. And I offer gratitude to my new friends and students and co-healers within the Alchemical Healing Community here in Seattle. I am especially grateful to the tools of my trade: the tarot cards, astrology, the runes, and the healing arts of Alchemical Healing and Huna. I am grateful to the totems of Crone, Bear, Eagle, and Dolphin for all of their special teaching. And finally I thank my ancestors who once lived on the British Isles in the midst of woods and forests, long since gone ... thank you for this system of knowledge you have passed down through eons. I especially want to thank the powerful healing of Hathor's Sycamore tree that stands at the entrance to the temple of Ptah, Sekhmet, and Nefertum at the Karnak temple in Luxor, Eygpt. Thank you for the words I heard in Seti I's tomb in the Valley of the Kings, Oh, it is the tree lady. Welcome! This was a surprising encouragement! Here I experienced the light and love of who I am. This was not a place of death at all, but a blueprint for becoming. Thank you for my personal symbol of the tree and the cup and the words Ancient Sovereignty given to me by my ancestors from the British Isles while in a guided visualization. Thank you to the Atlantians and Thoth for making sure wisdom and the principles of nature were given to the lands of Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and Britain.Lastly, thank you to the trees themselves for the wealth of teaching and magic support. I honor them and give my gratitude. [contents] Introduction The trees are especially powerful in their healing energies. It is for this reason, and because of my ancestry, that I follow the Celtic tree calendar based on the thirteen moon months of the year. It is in this way that I stay close to the natural world and Universal Intelligence and Love; Goddess, God, and all that is! In the Celtic tradition, it is said there were originally two powerful source energies that came to our planet through the first rays of the sun, long before humans appeared. These energies were called Celi and Cerridwen\u2014male and female\u2014and they embodied the laws of the universe (the macrocosm) and the laws of the natural world (the microcosm). Celi and Cerridwen spread their knowledge and essence in the form of spirits called dryads. Dryads became the keepers of the original creators' teachings and made their homes in the trees. Each sacred tree of the dryads represented a cosmic expression of this primeval archetypal essence, which later became associated with Celtic gods and goddesses and formed the rich fabric of Celtic story and myth. There are twenty-five trees, runes, and Celtic ogham letters that represent the teachings of these dryads. Fifteen of these trees are part of the Celtic tree calendar. The tree alphabet was used in the British Isles from approximately 600 bce until about ad 700 (Murray and Collins, 7-8). The essence of the early spiritual practices of the British Isles embraces and supports natural law and order, of which we as humans are an important part. In order to establish and maintain our correct place as stewards in the cosmos, I believe we can reclaim what was once ours. I believe many of us are hungry and ready for guidance as we work toward changing and uplifting our consciousness. Most spiritual paths lead pupils through developmental stages of consciousness. Disciples are led through these stages through initiations. In a manner of speaking, we are ripe for what has been preserved and protected in the various mystery schools of our world. It is my belief that by returning to ancient systems of knowledge and using them in our daily lives, we can support and encourage the changes required on all levels that will preserve our species and our beautiful planet. This is not to say we can go back to purely ancient ways, but we can connect with these teachings to receive guidance from source that can enable us to live in the present and meet our challenges. Celtic tradition and culture honored the wisdom of the earth. Women were honored as healers and midwives. The cycles of the sun and the moon were honored as well. The Celts learned about the power of the plants and trees to heal. They prayed to the elements, the animals, the trees, and the rocks. All held essence and spirit and teaching. Reverence and gratitude were part and parcel of everyday life. Contact with unseen worlds was taken for granted, and magic was developed out of knowledge given through communication with other dimensions. Shamanism was not out of the ordinary. With foreign invasion of the British Isles came imposed cultural, political, and religious beliefs that attempted to end the indigenous way of harmonious life with the laws of nature. Other traditions and religious beliefs curtailed ancient ways, but did not completely kill them. The infusion of Christianity brought crucial change. Many people, including women, were burned at the stake as witches. People were labeled as heretics and were persecuted. The Catholic Church and its grand inquisition, as well as the Protestant churches, did a masterful job of creating fear and repression. The knowledge went underground but did not die. Today, we are beginning to respect and learn about the spiritual knowledge of ancient cultures and understand that indigenous people carry the keys to the very survival of our planet. Native European people have much in common with the Native Americans and other indigenous peoples worldwide. People on the North American and European continents developed rich traditions of myth and legend passed on through generations. Celtic knowledge is one such mystery school available to us, and through it we can understand and appreciate our true nature. We can look to these spiritual sensibilities to steady us in the intense times in which we live. We can look to the ancient wisdom as a way to increase our consciousness and identify as spiritual beings. We can reaffirm our interconnectedness with all life. As Great Britain was deforested, her people lost their connection to nature, a great tragedy not given much thought today. If we reclaim the knowledge that was lost and bring it forward to unite with this time and this place, we can create something new. The spirits of the British Isles welcome this new synergy. Considering the destruction of the earth at this present time (for which our species is responsible), returning to ancient wisdom that embodies natural law is essential. If we can survive the next ten or fifteen years without blowing ourselves up and harming our planet beyond repair, our beliefs, behaviors, feelings, and actions will evolve and this may help to ensure our peace and harmony. We can understand with reverence and humility that we are powerful co-creators with source. We can create a world we wish to live in that gives proper respect to all life forms. I've had a longtime desire to reconnect with my true place and position in the grand scheme of things; it has motivated me to dig into my own ancestral past. I have spent years interacting with and sharing these teachings, and my connection with the archetypal power that rests in the trees has changed my life. I hope that in bringing these teachings forward that others can use them for encouragement, support, and meaning. I hope we all can reconnect with our birthright, and joyfully take up our responsibility as stewards of our incredible paradise. [contents] The Trees' Essential Role The truth is, we could not live without trees. Trees act as our planet's lungs. Trees take in the carbon dioxide we exhale, and we breathe in the oxygen they exhale; we have a mutually beneficial relationship. They do us a great service of cleaning our air as well, and without them, our atmosphere would become impossibly toxic to us. They also are responsible for drawing water into the soil, essential to the water cycle that provides drinkable groundwater. Trees also release water into the atmosphere, allowing for the condensation that causes rain. Without the rain, desertification begins. This leads to massive famines as the topsoil is blown away. The evaporation leaf surface of a single tree is equivalent to the evaporation of a forty-acre lake (Hartmann, 42). As we destroy the forests that provide us with these essential ecological cornerstones, we have fewer oxygen-releasing leaf surfaces, less circulation in the water cycle, and increased desertification, while we continue to burn trees and place more carbon into the atmosphere. It seems we have no concept of the trees' essential role in our ecosystems. Forests are imperiled worldwide. We are not connected to nature enough to realize that when the forests are in danger, we are too. Trees also grant us source knowledge and essence. Trees stand upright, as we do; their trunks are like our bodies, their limbs like arms, their roots like legs. They stand between Mother Earth and Father Sky, as we do. We are both grand bridges between these two spheres of consciousness. They mirror to us our own pattern of spiritual awareness and knowing that travels from our roots that connect us to the earth on up to our crown, connecting us to all that is above. This inner spiritual structure is called the djed, the tree of knowledge. It is this inner tree that has been given to our species, a gift that is mirrored in the function of all trees and what we spiritually share with actual trees. As Celtic tradition teaches, each tree species embodies its own knowledge. We can tune in to tree wisdom and converse with it. Our tree teachers are available to us all; we only have to sit with a tree and listen. The mystery of consciousness is what allows us to evolve, and our evolution is intimately intertwined with trees. Our stewardship, then, is our heritage and our true purpose. The trees are here to remind us of our duty. They call to us and say: We are healers. You are healers. All life is sacred, as is our connection to you and you to us. Wake up, humankind, and take up your rightful place and heritage in the holy scheme of nature. We are not separate and have never been so. Paradise exits right here and right now. Paradise is this planet in its beauty and perfection. We invite you to become one with us and recognize the perfection that you are and that we are. Remember, in protecting the tree people, you are protecting your own species and all of life. This is what you are to do. This is your stewardship. [contents] The Apple Tree and the Cedar Tree I feel very blessed that an apple tree saved my life. My apple tree healing occurred in 1982; I was thirty-five. At that time, my life was very stressful and demanding; I was a new parent, and my marriage, which should have been my solid foundation, was crumbling and unstable. Hopelessness, inadequacy, and anxiety seemed to be the only feelings I had. In a very black and despondent mood (yes, thoughts of suicide), I cried out for help and found myself running into the arms of a huge apple tree that beckoned me from the vacant lot behind my house. I wrapped my arms around the tree, and to my utter amazement, the tree responded! Its response was visceral: it was unconditionally loving, reassuring, and the most wonderful sort of energizing. I was startled out of my despair and completely taken aback: was I crazy? Did I make this up? The impression I was left with was one of a communication of help, comfort, and encouragement\u2014the tree's perfect gift. My mood lifted, and I was smiling. I went back to my job of being a wife and mother as best I could. Years later, while studying the Celtic tree calendar, I discovered the apple tree's association with choice as well as beauty. Indeed, both these lessons reached me on that life-changing day. I am forever grateful for her lessons. I began a new relationship with, and found a new understanding of, trees as healers and communicators after receiving the apple tree's message. Curious for more, I looked at all the trees around me, and became more aware them, grateful for their presence. I also began New Age and Eastern religious studies. I began to understand things differently and interacted with nature's unseen realms. While working as a teacher for high school dropout students, I developed my skills as a tarot reader and astrologer, and fostered the strong guidance I received from dreams. Time passed, and my life changed again radically. I divorced, went back to school, received my master's in psychology, eventually remarried, had a daughter, and started working as a part-time therapist. I was so involved in the workings of everyday life that it wasn't until my late forties that I realized I needed spiritual renewal in my life. I was ready and able to attend to my own soul. I made a commitment to myself to pursue a spiritual path that would feed me. My path brought me back to the trees. Simply, I asked the universe to supply me with what I needed. I decided to abandon traditional religion and remain open to what would bring me true spiritual rejuvenation. The first teaching that came to me was through Brooke Medicine Eagle's Buffalo Woman Comes Singing and a woman named Starfeather, who held drumming circles in her suburban "}
