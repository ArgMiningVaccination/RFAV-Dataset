To attain healthy, beautiful skin on the outside, we must first learn how to achieve health and balance on the inside, and these dual goals for both men and women can be accomplished in the very special medical-spa environment that has been created to help them. The more we learn about our own bodies, the more we realize that the cell-to-cell communication system is vastly more complex than ever imagined. The skin is a unique organ derived from the same embryonic tissue as the brain, which gives both many similarities of structure and function. This means that what is therapeutic for the brain will also contribute to healthy and beautiful skin. And that is not all. The skin is not only our largest organ, but it also interacts with all other organ systems. The skin, however, is unique in that it is visible, and because of this very visibility, it can be used to assess health and disease throughout our bodies, as well as to indicate our age. A key component of the medical-spa experience is to teach people how to implement strategies that can keep many of the signs of aging at bay. As readers of The Perricone Prescription and The Wrinkle Cure know, I have long held the theory that aging is a disease. And to successfully treat a disease we must begin by learning its etiology\u2014its root cause. However, with the disease of aging there is no one definitive cause, as for example, there is with a talc miner who might develop lung cancer after many years of breathing minute talc particles. The causes of aging, as outlined herein, are as diverse as they are fascinating, and they all work synergistically to break down our organ systems, ultimately resulting in death. I believe that, regardless of the particular cause or causes, inflammation on a cellular level is at the very basis of aging. But there are many paths to inflammation and consequently, many methods at our disposal to stop it. Since we are responsible for creating much of the inflammation in our bodies by choosing the wrong diet and lifestyle, a few basic changes can greatly help us decrease the accelerated aging that inflammation can cause on our faces and bodies. Armed with this knowledge, it becomes apparent that a total mind-body approach to health and well-being is mandatory, and nothing can be of more help to us in integrating this holistic approach than the introduction of spa medicine into our lives. With spa medicine we can learn how to safely detoxify our bodies and begin a targeted nutraceutical program proven to help delay the signs of aging and the mental and physical degeneration that too often accompanies it. With spa medicine, we can learn about the exciting world of cosmeceuticals\u2014skin treatments containing highly active and efficacious ingredients that will help us delay, or avoid altogether, more invasive, potentially dangerous procedures. Spa medicine can also make it possible to forever delete the word diet from our vocabulary and our daily life. Learning how to make the right food choices, while eliminating the bad food choices, will enable us to both look younger and live longer. In addition, the right foods\u2014those with proven anti-inflammatory properties\u2014will help feed the brain as well as the body, ensuring that our minds are sharp and clear, our memories are functioning at optimal levels, and our inner state is one of well-being, happiness, and serenity. In introducing you to the basic tenets of spa medicine, we will make you aware of the latest mechanisms for slowing, preventing, and reversing the aging process. And with this new awareness, you will see that many of the conditions associated with aging are not inevitable, and you do not have to age at the same rate as your parents and grandparents did. Instead, we now have the means to remain healthy, independent individuals through the last few weeks, or last few hours, of our lives. \u2014Nicholas Perricone, M.D. Author, The Wrinkle Cure Foreword Nutrition Ihave a very simple definition of good medicine: it is any intervention that makes the patient feel better and can also be clinically verified. Although this is a much broader definition than most people are accustomed to, it also takes into consideration the true art of medicine. In the twentieth century, we associated medicine with drugs and surgery. Now, in the twenty-first century, we have to associate medicine with improved hormonal control. This is important since hormones can be more directly affected by diet and exercise than by drugs. The reason hormonal control will have such a great effect on your future is that hormones control inflammation, which is not only the underlying cause of most chronic diseases but also the aging process itself. This is why this book is important. It ushers in a new era, showing how good medicine should be practiced. Current medical care is usually done in aseptic environments that are virtually guaranteed to increase stress because the tests will only (falsely) confirm how ill you really are. Spa medicine is the opposite. You find yourself in an extremely pleasant, nonstressful environment, taking tests that reflect your current state of wellness. And if they indicate that you are moving out of that zone of wellness, then your primary prescription will be one of diet and exercise to help those hormones drive you back toward wellness. There are two distinct hormones that control your future: insulin and eicosanoids. Both are intimately connected with inflammation. Maintain these hormones in a therapeutic zone, and wellness is the result. Let them drift out of that therapeutic zone, and you have set the foundation for chronic disease. As you will learn in this book, insulin can best be controlled by diet and exercise, whereas eicosanoids can best be controlled by diet and nutritional supplements, especially purified fish oils. The power of spa medicine is such that you don't have to take my word for it. There are blood tests that measure these hormones, and they will indicate, with laserlike precision, your current state of wellness. Keep in mind that wellness is not a philosophical feeling\u2014it is a real physiological state in which you are keeping illness and inflammation under control. This is true for both the body and the outer skin. And here lies the evolution of spas. For years they have been considered a place where only the skin is pampered. Although that will still be true for spa medicine, skin wellness can now be maintained both topically and from within, at the same time that you are moving your body toward a clinically defined state of wellness. If you are ready to experience a new type of medicine whose goal is achieving wellness, as opposed to treating symptoms, then spa medicine lies in your future. It is said that the average physician treats the symptoms of disease, whereas the superior physician maintains the wellness of the patient. In the future, you will be much more likely to find the superior physicians practicing spa medicine. \u2014Dr. Barry Sears Author, The Zone Preface Researchers have long known that people in certain isolated villages around the world share an unusual feature. The Vilcabamba people of South America, the Hunzas of the Himalayas, the Okinawans of Japan, and the people living in the village of Orroli in Sardinia off the coast of Italy all boast an average life expectancy of a century, and their residents are astonishingly free of chronic agerelated diseases. How do they do it? Research points to their unpolluted environments, stress-free lives, unprocessed whole-foods diets, and active lifestyles. In our toxic, fast-food-driven, and stressful world, what can you do? Short of moving to a quaint village overseas and growing all of your own food, there is a solution. This book has been created to introduce you to an exciting new model of health\u2014spa medicine, the future of wellness. Spa medicine goes beyond pampering to a new way of life in which nutrition, exercise, nutraceuticals, and other healthy lifestyle practices can help you to not only survive but also thrive. This new body of medicine provides what our overburdened healthcare system cannot: healing and nurturing on all levels\u2014nutritionally, physiologically, emotionally, and spiritually. There are over 10,000 spas throughout the United States and Canada, and the number is growing every year. As microcosms of villages, these spas re-create stress-free, healthy lifestyles long known for well-being and longevity. The most forward-thinking spas now have physicians and other health professionals on staff to evaluate as well as educate their guests. In the future, many spas will be equipped with specialists in age-management, cardiology, dermatology, endocrinology, neurology, and plastic surgery. Eventually they will tackle hard-core medical issues like cancer and heart-disease prevention while providing creative ongoing care. Spa Medicine was written to provide you with proven longevity strategies to counteract our stressful world on a daily basis and to give you a fresh perspective on how to restore balance in your life. In Part One, the four wellness pillars of detoxification, nutrition, exercise, and mind-body approaches will create the foundation to carry you through difficult times and brighten your future, and in Part Two, the four secrets of longevity will help you redesign your optimum self to feel and look your best. These chapters are followed by eight appendices with details of topics covered in the book, a glossary of the more technical terms, and finally, a listing of some of the better medi-spas. You will benefit from the guidance of Doctors Graham Simpson, Stephen Sinatra, and Jorge Su\u00e1rez-Men\u00e9ndez, whose combined ninety years of medical and wellness knowledge take the principles of spa medicine into the twenty-first century and beyond. They will help you pinpoint the source of your stress, modify your diet, and support you in the most relaxed possible setting. Whether or not a spa visit is in your immediate future, this book will help you acquire the knowledge, resources, and inspiration to change, and will benefit you and your family for generations to come. Perhaps you, too, will write history when you reach the century mark.

Who are these seekers? What is driving them, and why has there been so much distrust of practitioners of conventional medicine? What is motivating even conservative, doctor-knows-best types of people to seek out alternative forms of healing? Clearly, the medical consumer is searching for less invasive, more effective, and safer medical interventions. Hungry for information, a significant percentage of our aging population is consulting alternative therapy practitioners, subscribing to health newsletters, visiting book and health food stores, and surfing the Web in record numbers. In the process, these people have created a whole new wellness industry outside the mainstream medical/pharmaceutical industry, which, in an attitude reminiscent of Nero fiddling while Rome burned, continues to promote drugs and surgery as the cures for soaring levels of chronic disease and premature aging. I believe the medical profession must wake up, stop fiddling, and examine all options that have the potential to ease human suffering. And who is better qualified than the highly trained medical professional to assess the efficacy and safety of alternative/complementary therapies and protect the public from quackery and charlatanism? Who can best team up with individuals in their quest to take charge of their own health and well-being? Once empowered with the knowledge of a wide variety of healing methods, physicians and their patients can become true partners in healing with a common goal: to give and receive the best possible care. These are the concerns of many forward-thinking physicians and health practitioners, and Graham Simpson, M.D., is a leader among them. He is a physician willing to embrace proven, complementary methods of nutritional, metabolic, and emotional medicine that will meet the needs of a new millennium. Using both the latest research and the wisdom of the ages, Simpson has tapped into a universal truth: optimal health involves much more than drugs or surgery, and true healing integrates the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of human beings. As a traditionally trained and grounded physician, Simpson has seen his share of disease, illness, pain, and trauma. He is highly credentialed, with board certifications in internal medicine and emergency room medicine. In these roles, Simpson has attended to thousands in internal medicine, and has worked tirelessly in emergency rooms. But this unusual man's passion doesn't stop there. As a member of the new breed of integrative physicians, Simpson now blends the best of both conventional and alternative medicine. He is a founding member of the American Holistic Medical Association, is certified in acupuncture, holds a homeopathic license, and is the creator of The Wellness Game, a board game that allows people to learn more about wellness while having fun. Simpson's interest and expertise in executive medical programs, antiaging strategies, and whole-body health have placed him on the leading edge of the exciting new field of spa medicine. Graham Simpson defines a compelling new wellness theory of integral health, which connects physical, mental, and spiritual energies. Striving to bring positive changes into people's lives, Simpson's goal is to transform the lives of the participants in his workshops where he offers an exciting model of preventive medicine and age management directed at reducing silent inflammation. Over the next several years, I predict that what we are calling medi-spas are going to become the centers for health education, counseling, alternative methodologies, and other health strategies that are not available in most hospitals and HMOs today. Those healthcare organizations simply do not have the time, patience, or resources to offer all the integrative therapies that the now-aging baby-boomer generation is demanding. My first spa experience made me a believer in the importance of taking time out to nurture our bodies. In 1984, I lectured at Canyon Ranch in Tucson, Arizona, in a desert atmosphere where the flowering cacti and colorful rock formations encourage meditation and reflection, while the healthful surroundings ease allergies and other respiratory conditions. During this weeklong experience, I took extended bike rides, lost five pounds, participated in health-education seminars, and returned home with newfound alternative therapies to complement my traditional training as a cardiologist and psychotherapist. In 1988, I discovered Gurney's Inn, a seaside resort in Montauk, Long Island, New York that features one of the world's purest saltwater pools, as well as an intensive program offering a dozen types of massage therapy. I wrote two of my books there, Lose to Win and Optimum Health, and developed a passion for fly-fishing. Now I have discovered a third jewel in this triple crown of wellness: the CuisinArt Resort and Spa on the island of Anguilla in the Caribbean. CuisinArt offers a pristine oasis of wellness featuring exercise, massage, nutrition, yoga, and other body-oriented therapies. Guests enjoy a vast array of organic fruits and vegetables plucked daily from the spa's unique hydroponic farm (see Appendix D). They feast on fresh coldwater fish from the ocean, teeming with beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. The purity of the environment and the magnificent white beaches of Rendezvous Bay wash away stress and open up the body, mind, and spirit to a new way of living. Guests at a typical medi-spa receive a comprehensive personal wellness profile from a wide variety of health professionals on the cutting edge of integrative medicine, and from world-class chefs, all teamed up to provide a blueprint for wellness like no other. They take home a priceless education on how they can help themselves survive, and thrive, on our planet today. Engaging in the spa wellness experience nurtures the body in biochemical, emotional/spiritual, nutritional, and physiological dimensions. The key is to fully experience all the methods offered and then take the knowledge back home. For myself as a health practitioner, a hiatus at a health spa gives me a period of rest, renewal, and rejuvenation. For anyone, it can be the perfect jump-start in your search for an optimum health program tailored to your needs. Maybe you need to shed a few pounds, lower your blood pressure and/or cholesterol level, or nurture your emotional self. The wisdom gained from participating in such a total spa-medicine experience can significantly enrich your life\u2014and your longevity. Graham Simpson has added the spa experience to his considerable expertise in conventional and alternative medicine, catapulting him to heights beyond the normal health and wellness model, and making him a leader in this microcosm of health care. As a clinical and creative innovator in this emerging field, Simpson has listened carefully to the cries of the public, and, touched by the healing energies of the landscape of Anguilla, he envisioned the book you now hold in your hands as his way of answering their needs. The creation of the spa MeSu\u00e1 by Dr. Jorge Su\u00e1rez-Men\u00e9ndez offers a new, exciting model in preventive and antiaging medicine. Along with his team of health professionals, this highly talented plastic surgeon has used spa concepts of detoxification and rejuvenation to take the body, and especially the skin, to a new level of glowing radiance. Both Dr. Simpson and Dr. Su\u00e1rez-Men\u00e9ndez bring equal measures of caring and compassion into the healthcare picture. In Part One, you will find our blueprint for wellness. The key chapter here is detoxification (see Chapter 2). At the turn of the twentieth century, one out of thirty-three people developed cancer. Next year one out of three people will develop cancer, and it will soon surpass cardiovascular disease as the number-one cause of death in the United States. Medi-spas are ideally suited to lower the toxic load we are each exposed to and can thus help decrease the incidences of chronic disease and the number of cancer deaths. Inflammation is the key chapter in Part Two, because it is emerging as the primary factor responsible for chronic diseases that are prevalent in aging, such as cancer and heart disease. You will soon see that stopping silent internal inflammation before it gets a foothold in the body is the key to healthy aging (see Chapter 7). Although many of you may not be able to avail yourselves of spa medicine in person, this book will provide you with all you need to practice the many spa concepts in your own home. Antiaging medicine is not about achieving immortality or cheating death\u2014promoting that would be pure snake oil, quackery, and charlatanism. There is not even any one successful formula for slowing down the ravages of aging, but there are some sound, scientifically strategic interventions that can slow down the inexorable decline that comes with the aging process. Our approach here combines ninety years of medical and wellness knowledge that carries the principles of age management into the twenty-first century and beyond. \u2014Stephen T.

Chapter 1 A Brief History of Wellness Our state of health and happiness depends more upon our perception of life events around us than on the events themselves. \u2014CHRISTIANE NORTHRUP, M.D., AUTHOR OF WOMEN'S BODIES, WOMEN'S WISDOM In the early 1900s, the germ theory\u2014the notion that a single germ produced a certain disease and only a single drug would cure it\u2014took hold of the American (and much of the developed world's) consciousness. As a result, pharmaceuticals became king with their promise of dramatic magic-bullet cures, and this resulted in huge economic incentives for the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry. Conventional medicine is disease-oriented and diagnosis-driven. Establishment doctors are known to treat diseases, not people, using symptoms and medical tests to assess the problem and ascribe treatment, typically pharmaceutical drugs or surgery. More than forty years ago, faith in this conventional medicine began to erode. While it still has great value in treating trauma, and some value in treating acute infectious diseases, many of us began to observe its shortcomings when it came to cancer, heart disease, and other diseases of civilization. Furthermore, we started noticing the many harmful side effects of drug therapy. As Jay Cohen, M.D., pointed out in his book Overdose, over 300 Americans die each day from the side effects of correctly prescribed medications. And most people are unaware that, in this manner, physicians contribute to this fourth leading cause of death (after heart disease, cancer, and "}
