Safe, effective, and deployable SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are urgently needed to mitigate the conse - quences of the pandemic and pro - tect from future outbreaks. The accelerated response to Covid-19 includes investments in preclini - cal and clinical testing and manu - facture of multiple vaccine candi - dates, with efficacy trials in the United States anticipated to start in July 2020. Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) have been pro - posed as a strategy for accelerat - ing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine develop - ment. Commentaries have focused on the ethical considerations raised by such models, noting their societal benefits and articu -lating a range of opinions regard - ing whether the risk is justified.1-3 The controversy they consider hinges on assumptions about the risk posed by purposeful infec - tion (challenge) of humans with SARS-CoV-2 in a world that lacks a reliable treatment for Covid-19. Both the public health imperative that drives the push for a SARS- CoV-2 CHIM and the demand that the risk be justifiable require a model capable of addressing meritorious questions and deliver - ing scientifically sound answers. On behalf of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interven - tions and Vaccines (ACTIV) Vac - cines Working Group, we have focused on the practical consid - erations relevant to the develop - ment of a SARS-CoV-2 CHIM and the prerequisites for using such a model. Traditional vaccine develop - ment progresses from preclinical to clinical phases and then to vaccine licensure and production at scale. Current efforts shorten development timelines by com - pressing and overlapping the stag - es, accelerating the transition be - tween clinical phases, powering efficacy studies to yield results in a short time frame, and pursuing large-scale manufacture of vac - cines before regulatory approval (see diagram). Although the large field trials involved are resource- intensive, they represent the stan - dard for evaluation of vaccine ef - ficacy.

PERSPECTIVE e63( 2)Accelerating Development of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines n engl j med nejm.org tions at greatest risk for disease acquisition or serious outcomes may be included. CHIMs, by contrast, require in - fecting healthy persons with a well-characterized microorganism in order to study pathogenesis, characterize the immune response, and elucidate the efficacy of vac - cines or therapeutics. CHIMs can minimize the uncertainty about exposure or disease acquisition inherent in field trials, thereby reducing the number of partici - pants needed to establish the de - sired end point (e.g., sterilizing immunity, reduced susceptibility to infection, or attenuated disease). Researchers in these studies must ensure that procedures minimiz -ing participant, staff, and com - munity risk are strictly enforced and that CHIMs are rigorously designed to provide scientifically robust data. A key requirement is the preparation of a Good Manu - facturing Practice (GMP) challenge stock with demonstrated stability and consistent infectivity. This process may take as little as a month for a well-characterized pathogen or as much as a year if attenuating mutations are intro - duced to minimize participant risk. Precise preparation and ad - ministration of the GMP inocu - lum; rigorous infection-control procedures; careful participant se - lection; adherence to regulatory, public health, and ethical guide -lines; and close safety monitor - ing are critical components of the research effort. Even with strict facility engineering controls, strin - gent discharge criteria, and expe - rienced personnel, there is a poten - tial risk of community spread of the challenge virus. Thus, CHIMs require active community engage - ment throughout the project.3 By design, the controlled na - ture of CHIMs limits their gener - alizability for predicting the ef - fectiveness of a vaccine candidate against natural exposure. Con - cerns about the generalizability and utility of CHIMs are magni - fied when disease manifestations vary with patients' age or coex - isting conditions. A model of dis - ease in healthy young volunteers may have questionable scientific validity when extrapolated to old - er or other at-risk populations that have disproportionate morbidity. Moreover, correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 are poorly un - derstood and may vary with the population or the vaccine con - struct. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set forth essential cri - teria for conducting SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies.4 Minimizing risk to participants, staff, and the community and ensuring robust scientific and clinical standards are critical considerations. Virtual - ly all recent CHIMs have involved microorganisms that either pose minimal risk for causing severe disease in the enrolled popula - tion, have effective oral treat - ments, or both. Currently, we lack sufficient knowledge of SARS- CoV-2 pathogenesis to inform in - clusion and exclusion criteria for a SARS-CoV-2 CHIM. A single death or severe illness in an otherwise healthy volunteer would be uncon - scionable and would halt progress. Vaccine Development Models for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines. Steps and timelines are shown for traditional and pandemic models of vaccine development. The hybrid approach reflects the addition of a controlled human infection model, illustrating the later start date and steps necessary before vaccine testing could begin.Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3Preclinical/uni0020Development Clinical/uni0020DevelopmentLarge-scale production LicensureTraditional/uni0020Vaccine/uni0020Development/uni0020\u2014/uni0020Multiple/uni0020Years Pandemic/uni0020Vaccine/uni0020Development/uni0020Model/uni0020\u2014/uni0020Overlapping/uni0020Phases/uni0020 Shortens development time Phase 1 Phases 2 and 3 Regulatory pathway Define target product profile, preclinical development, assay development Clinical/uni0020DevelopmentLarge-scale production Licensure Hybrid/uni0020Model/uni0020\u2014/uni0020Adding/uni0020New/uni0020Controlled/uni0020Human/uni0020Infection/uni0020Model Provides supporting data; does not accelerate initial timeline Manufacture SARS-CoV-2 challenge strain, engage communities and ethicists Develop SARS-CoV-2 CHIM when disease characteristics better known and rescue drug available Begin testing of vaccines in model The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org on March 18, 2021.

PERSPECTIVE e63( 3)Accelerating Development of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines n engl j med nejm.org A challenge virus with potentially attenuating mutations may miti - gate that risk, though such mod - ification (e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis, codon deoptimiza - tion, or serial passage) would in - crease development time. Critical - ly, a rescue therapy should be available, since even well-estab - lished CHIMs have resulted in unexpected severe illness. Institutions conducting CHIM studies should have Biosafety Level 3 laboratories for handling the virus, appropriate airborne- infection isolation rooms, and access to intensive care facilities. Multiple rounds of challenge are necessary to determine the best route of inoculation, the appro - priate challenge dose, and clini - cal and virologic characteristics. Before any vaccine intervention can be tested, a dosing strategy must be found that causes pre - dictable infection with minimal disease severity. Since each chal - lenge round would require an es - timated 3 weeks for infection and recovery of participants, with an additional week for facility de - contamination and analysis, the dose-escalation period is lengthy. Thus, the development of a robust challenge model for testing SARS- CoV-2 vaccines may be 1 to 2 years. Given that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will enter phase 3 trials immi - nently, these scientific and tech - nical factors alone make CHIMs unlikely to accelerate the estab - lishment of vaccine efficacy. Though SARS-CoV-2 CHIM development will be laborious, it would mitigate risk if vaccine ef - ficacy studies take longer than expected \u2014 for example, because of lower-than-anticipated disease attack rates. The experimental control provided by CHIMs has distinct advantages over field stud -ies for discerning correlates of protection, given the precise tim - ing of infection and the ability to measure immune responses at early and predetermined time points. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 CHIMs could determine the du - ration of immunity conferred by vaccines undergoing field trials. Development of a SARS-CoV-2 GMP stock, preferably with pre - dicted attenuating mutations, could proceed while appropriate facilities and standard operating procedures are prepared for SARS- CoV-2 CHIMs. Investigators at po - tential sites should begin soon to engage stakeholders in the scien - tific, regulatory, public health, and local communities. In parallel, the development of seasonal coronavirus CHIMs should proceed. Although coro - navirus 229E CHIMs were devel - oped beginning in 1967, immuno - logic characterization was limited to characterizing the presence and kinetics of neutralizing anti - bodies.5 More comprehensive models could be developed. None of the seasonal coronaviruses cause illness as severe as that caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, so challenge studies have favorable risk pro - files even if no rescue therapy is available. Proof-of-concept devel - opment of a seasonal coronavirus CHIM would provide the founda - tion for characterizing correlates of protection, host mediators of susceptibility, durability of im - munity, and any protective or en - hancing consequences of sequen - tial heterologous coronavirus infections. These detailed charac - may provide essential insights into SARS-CoV-2 infec - tions, and seasonal coronavirus CHIM development would opti - mize administration of challenge virus, timing of sample collec - tion, and analysis strategies dur - ing preparation of a SARS-CoV-2 challenge strain. Large, randomized, controlled trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are currently the most efficient, gener - alizable, and scientifically robust path to establishing vaccine effi - cacy. SARS-CoV-2 CHIM develop - ment might be able to accelerate development of later rounds of vaccine candidates. But a SARS- CoV-2 CHIM could also address essential questions of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis, duration of vaccine-induced immunity, and correlates of protection in healthy populations. Parallel development of a potentially attenuated SARS- CoV-2 GMP virus, development of a seasonal coronavirus CHIM, and preparation for a SARS-CoV-2 CHIM would represent a broad and sustained research effort to - ward understanding coronavirus biology and mitigating the cur - rent and future pandemics.
