to give priority to their right to protect public health, Recognizing that the spread of the tobacco epidemic is a global problem with serious consequences for public health that calls for the widest possible international cooperation and the participation of all countries in an effective, appropriate and comprehensive international response, 91 Act 851 Public Health Act, 2012 Reflecting the concern of the international community about the devastating worldwide health, social, economic and environmental consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke, Seriously concerned about the increase in the worldwide consumption and production of cigarettes and other tobacco products, particularly in developing countries, as well as about the burden this places on families, on the poor, and on national health systems, Recognizing that scientific evidence has unequivocally established that tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke cause death, disease and disability, and that there is a time lag between the exposure to smoking and the other uses of tobacco products and the onset of tobacco-related diseases, Recognizing also that cigarettes and some other products containing tobacco are highly engineered so as to create and maintain dependence, and that many of the compounds they contain and the smoke they produce are pharmacologically active, toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic, and that tobacco dependence is separately classified as a disorder in major international classifications of diseases, Acknowledging that there is clear scientific evidence that prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke causes adverse health and developmental conditions for children, Deeply concerned about the escalation in smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption by children

smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting, Acknowledging that tobacco control at all levels and particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition requires sufficient financial and technical resources commensurate with the current and projected need for tobacco control activities, Recognizing the need to develop appropriate mechanisms to address the long-term social and economic implications of successful tobacco demand reduction strategies, Mindful of the social and economic difficulties that tobacco control programmes may engender in the medium and long term in some developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and recognizing their need for technical and financial assistance in the context of nationally developed strategies for sustainable development, Conscious of the valuable work being conducted by many States on tobacco control and commending the leadership of the World Health Organization as well as the efforts of other organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and other international and regional intergovernmental organizations in developing measures on tobacco control, Emphasizing the special contribution of nongovernmental organizations and other members of civil society not affiliated with the tobacco industry, including health professional bodies, women's, youth, environmental and consumer groups, and academic and health care institutions, to tobacco control efforts nationally and internationally and the vital importance of their participation in national and international tobacco control efforts, Recognizing the need to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to undermine or subvert tobacco control efforts and the need to be 93 Act 851 Public Health Act, 2012 informed of activities of the tobacco industry that have a negative impact on tobacco control efforts, Recalling Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966, which states that it is the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,

Annex 2: History of the WHO FCTC process The idea of an international instrument for tobacco was initiated with the adoption of Resolution WHA 48.11 in May 1995, requesting the Director-General to report to the Fortyninth Session of the World Health Assembly on the feasibility of developing an international instrument such as guidelines, a declaration, or an international convention on tobacco control. 128 Public Health Act, 2012 Act 851 As a result of Resolution WHA48.1 1, WHO was requested to draft a feasibility study which was presented by the Director-General to the Ninety-seventh Session of the WHO Executive Board (\"The Feasibility of an International Instrument for Tobacco Control\" (EB97/ INF .DOC.4)). During that same session, the Executive Board adopted Resolution EB97R8, \"International framework convention for tobacco control.\" Later that year, the Forty-ninth Session of the WHA adopted Resolution WHA49.17, \"International framework convention for tobacco control\", requesting the Director-General to initiate the development of a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. As a result of this resolution, WHO's first treaty-making enterprise was formally launched. In 1998 newly-elected WHO Director-General, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland made global tobacco control a priority through the establishment of a Cabinet Project, the Tobacco Free Initiative, to focus international attention, resources and action upon the global tobacco epidemic. New multisectoral partnerships reflecting the nature of the action were developed. More importantly, Dr Brundtland worked with Member States to secure a negotiating mandate for the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and set about the task of mobilizing public and political opinion in favour of global rules for tobacco control. In May 1999 the Fifty-second World Health Assembly paved the way for multilateral negotiations on the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and possible related protocols. Resolution WHA52.18 established two bodies to draft the framework convention, to complete negotiations and to submit the final text for consideration by the Fifty- sixth World Health Assembly . These two bodies included a technical working group to prepare the proposed draft elements of the Framework Convention; and an intergovernmental negotiating body to draft and negotiate the proposed Framework Convention and possible related protocols. Both bodies were open to all Member States and regional economic integration organizations to which their Member States had transferred competence over matters related to tobacco control. The working group held two sessions in Geneva (25-29 October 1999 and 27-29 March 2000). Its output was a document with provisional texts 129 Act 851 Public Health Act, 2012 of proposed draft elements for the Framework Convention, submitted to the Fifty-third World Health Assembly with the comments of the working group'. In Resolution WHA53.16, the Health Assembly called upon the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body to commence negotiations with an initial focus on the draft Framework Convention without prejudice to future discussions on possible protocols, to report progress to the Fifty-fourth World Health Assembly, and to examine the question of extended participation by nongovernmental organizations as observers. The first session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (Geneva, 16-21 October 2000) was preceded by a public hearing on issues surrounding the Framework Convention. The Director-General convened this hearing in order to provide a forum for the public health community, the tobacco industry and farmers' groups to submit their case; records of the proceedings were made available to the Negotiating Body and, through the WHO web site, to the public. At the first session, Ambassador Celso Amorim of Brazil was elected as Chair, and a bureau was established with Vice-Chairs from Australia, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, South Africa, Turkey and the United States of America. The provisional texts of the proposed draft elements for a WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 2, which had been prepared by the working group, were accepted as a sound basis for initiating negotiations. Subsequently, Ambassador Amorim prepared a Chair's text of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 3 ; this first draft was released in January 2001 as a basis for further negotiations at the second session. A report on participation of nongovernmental organizations in the work of the Negotiating Body was presented to the Executive Board at its 107th session in January 200 14. In accordance with the provisions of decision EB 107(2) of the Executive Board, the Chairman of the Board acting jointly with the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations admitted two nongovernmental organizations, the International Nongovernmental Coalition Against Tobacco and Infact, into official relations with WHO as of 26 April 2001'. 130 Public Health Act, 2012 Act 851 In further preparation for the second session of the Negotiating Body, regional intersessional consultations were convened in most regions and subregions. Additional regional and subregional intersessional consultations took place in preparation for each of the subsequent sessions of the Negotiating Body . At the second session of the Negotiating Body (Geneva, 30 April - 5 May 2001), responsibility for consideration of the proposed draft elements was divided between three working groups. The principal output was the set of three CoChairs' working papers, an inventory of textual proposals made at the session merged with the Chair's original text. These working papers became the rolling draft text of the Framework Convention. At the third session (Geneva, 22-28 November 2001), two working groups issued revised texts and Working Group One later drafted a text. These documents were used to further negotiations during the fourth session. Having taken over as Permanent Representative of Brazil in Geneva in replacement of Ambassador Amorim, Ambassador Seixas Corra was elected as Chair of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body on the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control during its fourth session (Geneva, 18-23 March 2002). It was agreed that Ambassador Seixas Corra should prepare a new Chair's text, which would form the basis of negotiations during the fifth session of the Negotiating Body (14-25 October 2002). The text was released in July 2002. An international technical conference on illicit trade in tobacco products was hosted by the United States of America at the United Nations Headquarters in New York (30 July - I August 2002). The first four sessions of the Negotiating Body had considered numerous textual alternatives. Concerted deliberations at the fifth session narrowed the options, resulting in more focused negotiations. After a first reading, in plenary, of the new Chair's text, six issues were identified and discussed in open-ended informal meetings: advertising, promotion and sponsorship; financial resources; illicit trade in tobacco products; liability and compensation; packaging and labelling; and trade and health. Informal groups also held discussions on legal, institutional and 131 Act 851 Public Health Act, 2012 procedural issues and use of terms. Substantial advances in the negotiations were made and consensus was reached in several areas. On the basis of the outputs of the informal sessions and the intersessional consultations with various delegations and groups of delegations, Ambassador Seixas Corr~a issued a revised Chair's text of a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control on 15 January 2003. The sixth and final session of the Negotiating Body ran from 17 February - 1 March 2003. The negotiations were intense and broad ranging. Two important issues, advertising, promotion and sponsorship and financial resources, were discussed in two informal groups. At the final plenary meeting, the Negotiating Body agreed to transmit the text to the Fifty-sixth World Health Assembly for consideration for adoption in accordance with Article 19 of the Constitution. It also agreed that the discussion of protocols should be postponed until that Health Assembly, at which there would be time for consideration of the matter. At its final plenary meeting, the Negotiating Body agreed that the Chair of the Negotiating Body should draft a resolution recommending adoption of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control by the Health AssembIY6 . The final draft of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 7 was thus submitted to the Health Assembly for consideration for adoption, pursuant to Resolution WHA52.18. On 21 May 2003, the 56 th World Health Assembly, unanimously adopted the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The Convention was opened for signature, for a period of one year, from 16 June 2003 to 22 June 2003 at WHO headquarters in Geneva and thereafter at United Nations Headquarters in New York, from 30 June 2003 to 29 June 2004. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is a landmark for the future of global public health and has major implications for WHO's health goals. The conclusion of the negotiating process and the unanimous adoption of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, in full accordance with Health Assembly resolutions, represents a milestone for the promotion of public health and provides new legal dimensions for international health cooperation. 132 Public Health Act, 2012 Act 851 1 Document A53112. 2 Document AIFCTCIINB1/2. 3 Document AIFCTCIINB2/2. 4 Document EBI07119. 5 Document AIFCTCIINB2/6 Add. 1. 6 This draft resolution is contained in document A56/8/REV . 1. 7 See document A56/8, Annex. 8 WHO Document WHA56.1 FOURTH SCHEDULE (Section 112) Standards for drugs List of publications: (a) the British Pharmacopoeia; (b) the Extra Pharmacopoeia; (c) the United States Pharmacopoeia; (d) the International Pharmacopoeia (e) the standards, codes of practice, guidelines and recommendations issued by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, and (f) any other work of reference adopted and approved by the Authority FIFTH SCHEDULE (Section 114) Diseases for which advertisement for treatment, prevention or cure are prohibited: (a) Sexually transmitted diseases, other forms of genito-urinary diseases.

The Service requires collaboration between health workers, patients, clients and society . Thus the attainment of optimal health care is dependent on team work. Health facilities must therefore provide for and respect the rights and responsibilities of patients, clients, families, health workers and other health care providers. They must be sensitive to the patient's socio-cultural and religious backgrounds, age, gender and any other differences as well as the needs of patients with disabilities. The Health Service expects health care institutions to adopt the Patient's Charter to ensure that Service personnel as well as patients, clients and their families understand their rights and responsibilities. This Charter is made to protect the rights of the patient in the Health Service. It addresses: (a) the right of the individual to an easily accessible, equitable and comprehensive health care of the highest quality within the resources of the country; (b) respect for the patient as an individual with a right of choice in respect of health care plans; 135 Act 851 Public Health Act, 2012 (c) the right to protection from discrimination based on culture, ethnicity, language, religion, gender, age and type of illness or disability; and (d) the responsibility of the patient or client for personal and communal health through preventive, promotive and simple curative strategies. THE PATIENT'S RIGHTS 1. The patient has the right to quality basic health care irrespective of the patient's geographical location. 2. The patient is entitled to full information on the patient's condition and management and the possible risks involved except in emergency situations when the patient is unable to make a decision and the need for treatment is urgent. 3. The patient is entitled to know of the alternative treatments and other health care providers within the Service if these may contribute to improved outcomes. 4. The patient has the right to know the identity of the caregivers and any other persons who may handle the patient including students, trainees and ancillary workers. 5. The patient has the right to consent or decide to participate in a proposed research study involving the patient after a full explanation has been given; and the patient may withdraw at any stage of the research project. 6. A patient who declines to participate in or withdraws from a research project is entitled to the most effective care available. 7. The patient has the right to privacy during consultation, examination and treatment and in cases where it is necessary to use the notes of the patient's case for teaching and conferences, the consent of the patient must be sought. 8. The patient is entitled to confidentiality of information obtained about the patient and that information shall not be disclosed to 136 Public Health Act, 2012 Act 851 third party without the consent of the patient or the person entitled to act on the consent of the patient or the person entitled to act on behalf of the patient except where the information is required by law or is in the public interest. 9. The patient is entitled to the relevant information regarding policies and regulation of the health facilities that the patient attends. 10. Procedures for complaints, disputes and conflict resolution shall be explained to patients or their accredited representatives. 11. Hospital charges, mode of payment and the forms of anticipated expenditure shall be explained to the patient prior to treatment 12. Exemption facilities shall be made known to the patient. 13. The patient is entitled to personal safety and reasonable security of property within the confines of the institution. 14. The patient has the right to a second medical opinion if the patient so desires. THE PATIENT'S RESPONSIBILITIES The patient should understand the responsibilities of the patient as regard the patient's own health and therefore co-operate fully with the health care providers. The patient is responsible for, (a) providing full and accurate medical history for diagnosis, treatment, counseling and rehabilitation purposes; (b) requesting additional information or clarification regarding the patient's health or treatment, which may not have been well understood; (c) complying with the prescribed treatment, reporting adverse effects and adhering to follow up requests; (d) informing the healthcare providers of any anticipated problems in following prescribed treatment or advice; (e) obtaining the necessary information, which has a bearing on the management and treatment including the financial implications; 137 Act 851 Public Health Act, 2012 (f) acquiring knowledge on preventive, promotive and simple curative practices and where necessary for seeking early professional help; (g) maintaining safe and hygienic environment in order to promote good health; (h) respecting the rights of other patients or clients and Health Service personnel. (i) protecting the property of the health facility . NB: These rights and responsibilities shall be exercised by accredited and recognized representatives on behalf of minors and patients who are unable for whatever reason to make informed decisions by themselves.
