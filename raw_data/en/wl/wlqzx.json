State Plan for the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund U.S. Department of Education Issued: April 21, 2021 OMB Number: 1810 -0754 Expiration Date: October 31, 2021 2 Introduction The American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief ( \"ARP ESSER \") Fund , authorized under the American Rescue Plan (\"ARP\") Act of 2021 , provides nearly $122 billion to States to support the Nation's schools in safely reopening and sustaini ng safe operations of schools while meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the coronavirus disease 2019 (\" COVID -19\") pandemic. It is particularly important that ARP ESSER funding will enable States and local educational agencies ( \"LEAs \"), and more directly schools, to support students who have been most severely impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic and are likely to have suffered th e most because of longstanding inequities in our communities and schools that have been exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic . The U.S. Department of Education ( \"Department \") is committed to working in partnership with States so that these unprecedented resources are quickly put to work to ensure students have sustained access to in -person instruction and that the resources are used to provide the effective support students need a s they persist through and recover from the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. The thoughtful and timely use of these funds will have a lasting impact on our Nation's schools and help to address the inequities in resources, services, and opportunities avail able to our students. This template presents an opportunity for States to share their plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds with the public. The Department must approve a State educational agency's (\"SEA's \") plan in order to make the State's remaining ARP ESSER allocation available for use. Please note that the Department intends to issue ARP ESSER reporting requirements separately. Instructions Each SEA must provide descriptions and other information that address each requirement listed below . An SEA may use this template or another format as long as every item and element is addressed in the SEA's response . Throughout this document, questions that refer to an SEA's ARP ESSER funding are referencing the total allocation to be received by the SEA , including that which it allocates to its LEAs. Each SEA must submit to the Department by June 7, 2021, either: (1) its ARP ESSER plan or (2) the State requirements that preclude submission of the plan by that date and a date by which it will be able to submit its complete ARP ESSER plan. To submit the SEA's plan, please email the plan to y our Program Officer at [State] .OESE @ed.gov (e.g., Alabama.OESE@ed.gov ). In order to ensure transparency, the Department will post each plan on the Department's website when it is received and will indicate each p lan's approval status .

Describing the State's Current Status and Needs The Department recognizes the extraordinary efforts made by States, LEAs, and educators to support students during the COVID -19 pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe the progress they have made, the priorities and student needs guiding their ARP ES SER funding decisions, and their current and projected operating status. 1. Progress and Promising Practices : Provide your assessment of the top 2 -3 strategies that have been most effective in supporting the needs of students in your State during the COVID -19 pandemic, especially for students most impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Please include, if applicable, how your State will submit and encourage its LEAs to submit lessons learned and best practices to the Department's Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse so that they can be shared with other States and LEAs. Maine's Framework for Reopening Schools and Returning to In-Person Instruction is intended to assist Maine School Administrative Units (SAU) in the work of reintegrating back to in -person, classroom instruction. Informed by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), international models, and examples from across the U nited States , the framework includes six requirements for protecting health and safety and many additional ideas, recommendations, resources and strategies to support a successful return to in-person instruction. The fr amework's six parts are Part I: Physi cal Health and Safety Considerations, Part II: Social, Emotional, Behavioral, and Mental Health Considerations, Part III: Academic Programs and Student Learning Considerations, Part IV: Common Expectations for Hybrid and Remote Learning Models, and Part V: Additional considerations. As part of Maine's framework , the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Maine CDC developed a system to categorize counties . The system , the Maine Counties' Risk of COVID -19 Spread for Schools , is designed to inform and support local SAU decisions about whether and how to bring students back into the classroom . This categorization is based on a holistic assessment of quantitative and qualitative information. It includes, but is not limited to, recent data on case rates, positivity rates, and syndromic data (e.g., symptoms of influenza or COVID -19). The three -tiered health advisory system began on July 31, 2020 and continues to be updated on a two-week cycle. These recommendations are advisory. Starting in May 2021, all schools have another COVID -19 risk mitigation strategy provided by the State of Maine at no cost: routine pooled COVID -19 PCR testing of unvaccinated students and staff. This will allow early identification and isolation of asympt omatic COVID -19 cases, making in -classroom education safer. As such, Maine is updating its six physical health and safety considerations requirements to change the three -foot distancing requirement in schools to a recommendation, provided that the school is participating in the State's pooled testing program. Participation is defined as having at least 30% of school staff and students participating in the program . This program was available for the end of this school year and will continue to be ava ilable through the 2021 -2022 school year. Although the Maine CDC continues to recommend a minimum three -foot distancing between and among all students, schools that are participating in the testing program may shift away from this as a requirement after 5 achieving the minimum 30% participation. The requirement for six -feet distance when unmasked and eating or drinking continues to apply. 2. Overall Priorities : Provide your assessment of the top 2 -3 issues currently facing students and schools across your State as a result of or in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic including, to the extent possible, data illustrating why these are the most critical and/or most widespread issues facing schools and students. The Maine Department of Education has identified needs and priorities through multiple widespread discussions with stakeholders and through the collection of ideas for investments that will create sustainable infr astructure in terms of professional capacities, educational practices, and operational systems. The themes that emerged through this work were unfinished learning, career exploration, workforce development, mental and social -emotion al health, improvement to facilities and transportation that promote health and safety and enhancing the education workforce . The themes point to a Whole Student Approach and a statewide shift in educational practice. The Department will focus on social -emotional learning, mental and behavioral health programs, restorative alternatives to exclusionary discipline, trauma -informed practices, student -centered learning through interdisciplinary, project -based instruction, and related professional development f or educators and school leaders. To provide anytime, anywhere learning options and resources for educators, students and their families, the Department in collaboration with curriculum coordinators, Maine educational community organizations, museums, le arning centers, and Maine educators, creat ed a library of asynchronous learning modules that are aligned to Maine's Learning Results. Integrated across subject areas and project -based, these asynchronous modules ensure that learning is active, engaging, and continuous. Modules could be utilized for enhancing lessons, remediation, enrichment, credit recovery, or for use during remote learning - whenever a student cannot access classroom instruction. Each module is designed around the essential question and m odules are organized by grade level . The Maine Online Opportunities for Sustained Education (MOOSE ) was developed at the onset of the pandemic and additional modules will be added for the 2021 -2022 school year that will focus on cultural awareness specific to Maine's demographics. Maine is one of eleven States t hat receive d funding from the U.S. Department of Education's Rethink K -12 Education Models Funding. Maine's project, Rethinking Remote Education Ventures (RREV) offers a multi -pronged solution with a p rimary goal of generating innovative remote learning models to provide equitable access to high quality remote learning opportunities for all students. RREV will provide statewide resources and supports through professional development, coursework, and gui ded engagement in effective use of design processes to empower educators and school leaders as authentic research and development professionals. As new remote learning models are designed and piloted, they will be made widely available through an open -source community of practice platform to support collegial sharing, ongoing critical feedback, and continual revision and improvement to sustain a culture of innovation and to foster statewide access to exciting remote learning models. The project design cente rs around the belief that by both building capacity for innovative mindsets in education and supporting the design and implementation of the innovative ideas that are generated, we 6 can develop and support agile, effective, and resilient learning experience s that are responsive to local priorities and improve learning outcomes for all students. The Maine Department of Education developed it s first, state owned and free, PreK -12th grade Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Curriculum , referred to as SEL4ME . The SEL curriculum was intentionally developed by professions who, combined, have over 50 years of experience in education. Lessons are aligned with industry established best practices, are leveraged through an equity lens and include over 450 modules that cover PreK -12 scaffolded by grade. Following research and findings from the Maine's Opioid Prevention Task Force and Task Force on Childhood Trauma incorporating SEL into educational practices both for primary prevention and to address trauma is supported by evidence . The Maine Department of Education is dedicated to meeting the social emotional and mental health needs of ou r educators and students. The SEL4ME curriculum honors Maine's strong history of promoting social emotional learning and is flexible by design so that it can be used as an additional support for existing SEL, health or counseling programs, while also being a reliable and foundational way to enable schools to create brand new SEL programs across our State. The SEL4ME Team, consisting of diverse Maine experts and stakeholders, will continue to edit, add and develop new SEL content, ensuring that our State's u nique SEL needs are met. Moving forward, we expect the curriculum to expand from classroom supports to include school and district wide resources in the structured, and best practice use of SEL throughout school culture. While this curriculum is not a requ irement, research shows that the benefits of incorporating social emotional learning into our schools are significant and the SEL4ME Team will be providing free training and support to educators looking to use the SEL4ME curriculum. 3. Identifying Needs of Underserved Students : Describe your State's 2-3 highest priority academic, social, emotional, and/or mental health needs for the remainder of the 2020 -2021 school year (if applicable) and for the 2021 -2022 school year related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on each of the following student groups : i. Students from low -income families, ii. Students from each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race or ethnicity ), iii. Gender (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by gender) , iv. English learners, v. Children with disabilities (including infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities eligible under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( \"IDEA \")), vi. Students experiencing homelessness, vii. Children and youth in foster care , viii. Migratory students , and 7 ix. Other groups disproportionately impacted by the pandemic that have been identified by the SEA (e.g., youth involved in the criminal justice system, students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years, students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures , and LGBTQ + students ). To the extent possible, this description should include data on indicators such as estimates of the academic impact of lost instructional time ,1 chronic absenteeism, student engagement , and social -emotional well -being. Complete the table below , adding rows as necessary, or provide a narrative description. Table A1. Student group Highest priority needs Students from low -income families The need for universal connectivity was identified as the top priority of stakeholders across the state in terms of mitigating the impact from the COVID - 19 disruption. Teachers have been struggling to connect with the many students and families who do not have access to the internet. Students from each racial or ethnic background used by the State for reporting purposes - please add a row for each racial or ethnic group (e.g., identifying disparities and focusing on underserved student groups by race/ethnicity ) SAUs are still adjusting to having multi - cultural students in their schools , even after decades of the changing demographics in Maine . The educational system that was designed before our New Mainers a rrived and is not keeping up with the changes in the school population . Additional educational support s and interventions are needed as the pandemic has increased the achievement gap of students who need the educational opportunity and community of supportive , caring educators. Along with interventions, this is an opportunity for SAUs to rethink programming and assessment s as students are graduating academically unprepared for post- secondary educatio n. Families of New Mainers are engaged with their children(s ') education but could benefit 1 For the purposes of the plan, \"academic impact of lost instructional time \" refers to \"learning loss\" experienced by students because of the COVID -19 pandemic, as referenced in the ARP Act and the CRRSA Act . 8 Student group Highest priority needs from an understanding of higher education expectations and availability through supports provide by community - based organizations that are woven into the New Mainers communities. English learners The need to gauge the impact of remote and hybrid learning on language development and content acquisition, especially for students who are at proficiency levels 1 and 2 and Students with Limited or Interrupted Formal Education , has presented itself during the public health emergency . To provide intensified supports to ensure that th e impact remote and hybrid learning is mitigated to the greatest extent possible while a ddress ing the social and emotional needs that have arisen from remote and hybrid learning as well as a disproportionate effect of the pandemic (in terms of socioeconomic impact, illness, and lives lost) . Children with disabilities With 90 early learning programs operating within the Child Development Services (CDS) office statewide closed due to the pandemic , many identified students were unable to access their IFSP (Individual Family Service Plan) and IEP (Individual Education Program) services creating a need to explore expanding public Pre-K classrooms to include more CDS children . Challenges with remote education for children who have IEPs included engaging students consistently while in remote mode. Moreover, in some instances families elected remote education for their children even when in-person instruction that adhe red to safety protocols was offered . Some schools offered hybrid instruction by educating separate cohorts of students on separate days of the week yet offered their students who had IEPs the opportunity to attend schools when both cohorts were in attendance thus doubling the learning opportunity as compared to 9 Student group Highest priority needs non-disabled peers . Nevertheless, not all eligible students wit h disabilities accepted the opportunity for full or near full time in -person instruction. In some isolated cases, school districts that had used Coronavirus Relief Funds (CRF) to develop collaborative childcare programs (called Day Programing) with commun ity partners so that children had a safe place to be and to develop socially with academic support on non-school days were not equipped to provide for the individualize social and behavioral needs of all students who ha ve disabilities. Thus, some children and families may have missed several days of programming until suitable arrangements and changes to the IEPs could be made. Completion of necessary evaluations and re-evaluations of students as required in a timely manner through IDEA was a chall enge given remote instruction and sometimes uneven participation or attendance of children. Oftentimes, LEAs applied to use CARES Act ESSER and CRF program funds to contract for extra time with psychologists who completed the required evaluations as soon a s possible when students and providers were able to work toge ther. The Department anticipates that additional evaluations and services will be needed as some of the students who were not attending or participating in remote or in -person modes of instructio n during the public health emergency return to in-person education as conditions improve. Students experiencing homelessness Coordinate with homeless advocates, housing coalitions, homeless shelters for getting a sense of needs and community solutions as the largest need is, as always, a need for safe and secure living conditions with access to basic needs like food, clothing, and hygiene ite ms. Social emotional support s that help student s manag e emotions, be heard , feel and show empathy, an d make thoughtful, 10 Student group Highest priority needs responsible decision has presented itself through this public health emergency . Additional s upport is needed for SAU s to increase the capacity of identifying students who are experiencing homelessness as many SAUs in Maine are rural and small with limited staff time dedicated to the identification process. Engage statewide McKinney -Vento Coordinator s in meetings and professional learning to be able to establish a network of peers serving as resources but also support ing the development of statewide informational materials for school s, students, families and community members about available assistance and support. Children and y outh in foster care The Maine Department of Education's Office of Student and School Supports and the Maine State Legislature have taken a renewed interest in the wellbeing of children and particularly yout h in foster care. Legislation was proposed to support youths who experienced educational disruption due to foster placements during high school to ease their ability to earn credits to achieve a diploma. Additionally, Legislation was proposed that would support students who formerly were in foster care during their transition to higher education. The Legislation was drafted to support identified needs among Maine children and youth in foster care and exiting from foster care. The Department propos es to communicate broadly to SAUs via Priority Notices, ARP Office Hours, and during Stakeholder and Regional Superintendents' Meetings that ARP ESSER may be used to support all students but especially under -served students , including youth in foster care, as they work toward completing high school and move on to post -secondary educational opportunities. For example, 11 Student group Highest priority needs models of exemplary internship, job shadowing, or college application projects will be offered to LEAs for their consideration. Migratory students The need for universal connectivity was identified as the top priority in addition to family -school communication and home -based services to connect with the family and gain a better understanding of the need s. Maine students who participate in the Migrant program include students whose parents work within the state but in seasonal industries such as holiday wreath -making and more traditional harvesting , as well as students whose parents come to the United States annually in the summer and fall to labor in moderate -to-large scale fruit groves and vegetable fa rms. Several families who have Spanish as their first language travel to \"Down East\" Maine each summer for work . The Maine Department of Education has established short -term summer educational program in the Down Eas t area during the summer harvest. The Department proposes to encourage local school districts in the area that operate summer programs for their regula rly attending student s to include the children of transient migrant workers in their programs. That way the children of the migrant laborers will have more extended and integrated learning opportunities. Program funds will support extended instructional ti me, integrate English learning, and develop culturally and individually responsive and critically oriented leaning opportunities for all participants in the SAUs' summer programs. Other groups of students identified by the State (e.g., youth involved in the criminal justice system, students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years, students who Initiatives that impact culture and education in ways to promote more equitable, inclusive, productive, and resilient soci ety are needed and should focus on universally accessible, high quality early childhood programs , 12 Student group Highest priority needs did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closur es, LGBTQ + students ) recruitment, preparation, and retention of high quality, diverse educator workforce, comprehensive curriculum and assessment guidelines focused on critical thinking, multiple perspectives throughout history, citizenship for democratic society, and values a child's whole identity of social, emotional, spiritual, and mental well -being. In addition, maintain accountability systems that align and minimize standardized testing while holding communities accountable for access to high quality education that is responsive to students' needs . School discipline reform in needed that prioritize supporting students to reach their full potential and be integrated into school communities . Also, data systems that are publicly accessible and transparent and i nfrastructure to ensure equitable access to technology . The MOOSE program which used previous funding sources to develop model curricular activities for use in a variety of ways will expand t o develop lessons that include learning both implicitly as well as explic itly about the history of marginalization of individuals who identify as LGTBQ+. Curricular units will also highlight pioneers in the struggle for acceptance of indiv iduals who identify as LGTBQ+ as well as leaders in the struggle for civil rights for individuals who identify as LGTBQ+. Curricular materials that focus directly (i.e., learning about Harvey Milk) and indirectly ( i.e., including stories of families that h ave same gender parents in routine classroom lessons ) normalize individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ and make the learning environment more welcoming for students. In that way, students who identify as LGBTQ+ who were unengaged both before and during the public health emergency can be 13 Student group Highest priority needs welcomed into an environment that is supportive. 4. Understanding the Impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic : Describe how the SEA will suppo rt its LEAs in identifying the extent of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on student learning and student well -being, including identifying the groups of students most impacted by the pandemic. Where possible, please identify the data sources the SEA will suggest its LEAs use in thoughtfully diagnosing areas of need, including data on the academic, social, emotional, and mental health impacts of lost instructional time . The Maine Department of Education has truly forced on the equity and excellence for Maine students and health, safety and wellbeing for students, staff, and school communities throughout this public health emergency. The Department has been working nonstop to ensure that SAUs hav e the most updated information, medical science, and necessary resources to prepare facilities, staff, and the students and families served for what will be a very different back -to-school experience. The Department, Maine DHHS, and the Governor's Office h as been meeting with Maine Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) since the onset of the pandemic to develop communication and decision -making plans. This ongoing focus, conversations and resources has positioned the Department to be able to support our SAUs in identifying the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on student learning and student wellbeing. The Maine Department of Education has been meeting traditional stakeholder groups that support SAU curriculum coordinators within Maine's Curriculum Leaders Association, special education directors through Maine Administrators of Services for Children with Disabilities, and teacher leaders along with superintendents in each region of the State, the Maine Principal Association, and the Maine School Management A ssociation to engage in conversation about needs and concerns. In addition, the Maine Department of Education's Student Cabinet meets quarterly with the Commissioner of Education to discuss educational opportunities, improvements, and policy. The purpose o f the Student Cabinet is to provide a forum for Maine students' voices from each county to be heard. Each of these platforms and meetings have been utilized to strengthen the Department's understanding of the needs of student statewide and will continue to be employed. Furthermore, the Department have work ed with less traditional yet important organized groups who have asked to participate in plans for moving ahead with public education a s we regroup and recover as the effects of the pandemic lessen. Representatives of these groups offer views of how under -served groups have experienced the pandemic. For exampl e, a group of educators for education equity offer perspectives that represent experiences of marginalized groups of students and advocate for recruiting educators from under -represented groups who will reflect the student bodies of some of the schools in more urban and suburban areas in the state. (Rural communities that accept migrant laborers seasonally also ser ve under -represented stude nts in Maine.) A coalition of leaders of immigrant groups in the state have informed officials in the Department that students have shied away from some urban schools during the pandemic resulting in a high rate of absenteeism due to the lack of culturally responsive pra ctices in the schools 14 that have enrolled children of immigrant families largely from African countries for decades. Visual and performing arts educators offer a perspective of educators in programs that are often at risk of being cut due to budget shortfal ls; these educators can document for the Department both the ways their programs have been marginalized, traditionally, and how the programs can address student social, emotion, expressive, and advocacy needs as school programs regroup in the wake of the public health emergency. Advocates of outdoor education - especially for young children - also document the ways in w hich natural environments promote positive physical and mental health, develop a sense of aesthetics, promote cognitive development and self-reflection, and provide opportunities for learning about the environment and climate change. These outdoor programs for young children will provide optimal learning environments for children who did not enroll in school even when they were eligible to start Kin dergarten or pre -Kindergarten due to the pandemic. 5. School Operating Status : It is essential to have data on how students are learning in order to support the goals of access and equity, especially for student groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. Describe the current status of data collection on operational status and mode of instruction of all schools in your State . This description must include: i. A description of to what extent, and how frequently, the State collects now and will collect in the future data for all schools in your State on: a. Mode of instruction: The number of schools in your State that are offering fully remote or online -only instruction; both remote/online and in -person full-time in -person instruction; b. Enrollment: Student enrollment for all students and disaggre gated for each of the student groups described in A.3.i- viii for each mode of instruction; and c. Attendance: Student attendance for all students and disaggregated for each of the student groups described in A .3.i- viii for each mode of instruction . The Maine Department of Education collects data from schools for State and Federal reporting requirements, to determine equitable distribution of resources, and to inform program and policy analysis. Schools and districts report data to the Department throughout the school year through the following data collection systems: NEO for school and staff data and information, Synergy for student data and information, and Maine Educator Information System (MEIS) for educator credentialing. State lev el data collection is a very important factor in calculating State subsidy for districts, informing legislative policies, providing transparency to taxpayers, and helping the Department support schools and districts as they make decisions about program and curriculum needs. 15 The Operational Data Store (ODS) called NEO contains numerous data sets submitted by schools and districts related to facilities, financial, nutrition, staff and student data. The student data collected in Synergy and reported out in N EO includes enrollment and attendance but not currently any data related to the mode of instruction. Through a data collection survey, the Maine Department of Education obtained mode of instruction, enrollment, and attendance data. The new layer of data, mode of instruction, was requested through a priority notice that was distributed to every superintendent statewide. The Data Team Governance, which is led by the Education Data Manager and comprised of the Maine Department of Ed ucation staff members and SAU school leaders is defining and discussing the ongoing collection of learning modality. This student level data will be collected ongoingly in the individual SAU's Student Information System and reported to the Maine Department of Education through Synergy and reported out back out to SAUs through NEO by January 30 for July through September and October through December, by April 30 for January through March and by July 30 for April through June. For the 2022 -2023 school year a nd beyond, Quarter 1 data (July through September) will be reported to the Department by October 30. ii. The data described in A.5.i.a. and b. using the template in Appendix A (and to the extent available, the data described in A.5. i.c.) for the most recent time period available . Please note that this data can be submitted separately within 14 calendar days after a State submits this plan. The SEA must also make this data publicly available on its website as soon as possible but no later than June 21, 2021, and regularly provide updated available information on its website. The Department will periodically review data listed in A.5.i on SEA websites . The Maine Department of Education will be sharing the data collect ed on the ARP data collect ion survey on our website by June 21, 2021 as referenced in the requirements of section 2001(i). The link will be shared with the U.S. Department of Education and the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education . The website will help s chool administrators, school personal and staff , students, families and community members and a widespread of stakeholders visual and understand the data that was collected and presented. 16 iii. To the extent available, a de scription of the planned operational status and mode of instruction for the State and its LEAs for Summer 2021 and for the 2021 -2022 school year. In Maine, nearly every school has been open for some in -person instruction since Fall 2020. In most schools across the country, particularly in high poverty and underserved communities, partially or 16 fully remote instruction has lasted for most of the 20 20-2021 school year. Summer 2021 provides an immediate opportunity to address inequities. As schools are developing and refining their plans for summer learning opportunities for students, and addressing unfinished learning caused by the impacts of COVID -19, Maine Department of Education has compiled a guidance document filled with ideas and resources. The resources, guiding questions and suggestions may be useful as schools reconsider or redesign what summer learning looks like for students this year, and for future programming. The Maine's Summer Learning Guidance is Attachment A. The Maine Department of Education will collect data on program enrollment and design at the end of the summer to have accurate information and data on the summer educational op portunities that were provided statewide. Our content specialists, SEL and mental health specialists, early childhood specialists and innovation team are all here to help with additional resources or ideas. The Department also encourages the SAUs to submi t lessons learned and best practices to the United States Department of Education's Safer Schools and Campuses Best Practices Clearinghouse. B. Safely Reopening Schools and Sustaining their Safe Operations The Department recognizes that safely reopening schools and sustaining their safe operations to maximize in -person instruction is essential for student learning and student well -being , and especially for being able to address the educational inequities that have been worsened by the COVID -19 pandemic . In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in this vital area. 1. Support for LEAs : Describe how the SEA will support its LEAs in safely returning to in -person instruction and sustaining the safe operation of schools . This description must include : i. How the SEA will support its LEAs implementing , to the greatest extent practicable, prevention and mitigation policies in line with the 17 most up -to-date guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC \") for the reopening and operation of school facilities to effectively maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and other staff ; Complete the table below, adding rows as neces sary, or provide a narrative description. Table B1. Mitigation strategy SEA response Universal and correct wearing of masks Maine's Framework for Reopening Schools and Returning to In -Person Instruction developed in consultation with the D HHS and the Maine CDC includes recommendations for schools and six requirements, such as physical distancing, mask wearing and other measures, to mitigate the risk of COVID -19 transmission within schools. The framework indicates that adults, including educato rs and staff, and students age five and above are required to wear a mask/face covering that covers their nose and mouth when indoors. Masks are recommended for children ages two to four, when developmentally appropriate. Masks/face coverings must be worn by all students and staff on all modes of school transportation ( i.e., Bus, vans) . Face masks/coverings must be worn during voluntary indoor school sports. Face shields may be an alternative for those students and staff with documented medical or behavioral challenges who are unable to wear masks/face coverings . Face shields worn in place of a face covering must extend below the chin and back to the ears. Physical distancing (e.g., including use of cohorts/podding) Under the requirements of Maine's Framework for Reopening Schools and Returning to In -Person Instruction adults must maintain six feet of distance from others to the extent possible while maintaining 3 feet of distance is acceptable between and among studen ts when combined with the other safety requirements, including the wearing of masks. Handwashing and respiratory etiquette All students and staff in a school must receive training in proper hand hygiene. All students and staff must wash hands or use sanitizing gel upon entering the school, before and after eating, before and after donning or removing a face mask, after using t he restroom, before and after use of playgrounds and shared equipment, 18 Mitigation strategy SEA response and before and after riding school transportation. Cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, including improving ventilation Cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surface s is recommended as the virus can be spread if someone touches a surface contaminated with the virus and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. However, as COVID -19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets, preventing person -to- person transmissio n is more important than frequent cleaning and disinfection. The following strategies and protocols are recommended: 1. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains, keyboards, light switches) within the school and on school buses at least daily or between uses as practicable. 2. Develop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection. 3. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection products, including storing produ cts securely away from children. Use products that meet EPA disinfection criteria. 4. Have users wash their hands before and after using shared objects. Focus increased cleaning and disinfecting on high -touch items 5. Use only routine maintenance for outdo or playgrounds and other natural play areas, as hand hygiene will be emphasized before and after use of these spaces. Outdoor play equipment with high -touch surfaces such as railings and handles should be cleaned and disinfected regularly if used continuou sly. 6. Install signage and equipment to enable effective health and safety procedures. 7. Ensure organizations that share or use the school facilities follow the health and safety guidelines established in this guidance. Please note that c lassrooms and/or areas that have been used by an individual diagnosed with COVID -19 must be closed off until thorough cleaning and sanitization takes place. Contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine, in collaboration with the State, local, The Maine Department of Education is currently employing over twenty retired nurses after receiving training through the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to provide Maine schools with specialized supports throughout the contact tracing process. The Maine Department of Education 19 Mitigation strategy SEA response territorial, or Tribal health departments contact tracers will support the work of school nurses and other school staff as they communicate with and monitor close contacts of positive cases. The contact tracing team assists in the notification to those who have been deemed a close contact to a staff member or student who has tested positive for COVID - 19. This team will enroll \"close contacts\" into Sara Alert, an online platform that Maine CDC uses to notify and monitor people exposed to the coronavirus. The Maine CDC will continue to investigate confirmed cases and outbreaks associated with schools. The Framework for Return to In -Person Instruction developed in consultation with the Department of Health and Human Service s and the Maine Center for Disease Control includes recommendations for schools and six requirements, such as physical distancing, mask wearing and other measures, to mitigate the risk of COVID -19 transmission within schools. Under these requirements, a \"medical isolation space\" (separate from the nurse's office) must be designated for students/staff who exhibit COVID -19 symptoms during the school day. Adequate ventilation is required for classrooms, with schools having flexibility in implementation such as using properly working ventilation systems or outdoor air exchange using fans in open windows or doors. Diagnostic and screening testing Starting in May 2021, all schools have another risk mitigation strategy provided by the State at no cost: routine pooled COVID -19 PCR testing of unvaccinated students and staff. This will allow early identification and isolation of asymptomatic COVID -19 ca ses, making in - classroom education safer. As such, Maine is updating its six requirements to change the three -foot distancing requirement in schools to a recommendation, provided that the school is participating in the State's pooled testing program. Parti cipation is defined as having at least 30% of school staff and students participating in the program (see the School Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for details.) This program is available now and will continue to be continue to available through the 2 021-2022 school year. Although 20 Mitigation strategy SEA response the Maine CDC continues to recommend a minimum three -foot distancing between and among all students, schools that are participating in the testing program may shift away from this as a requirement after achieving the minimum 30% participation. The requirement for six -feet distance when unmasked and eating or drinking continues to apply. Efforts to provide vaccinations to educators , other staff, and students, if eligible All Maine residents who are Pre -K through Grade 12 school staff/teachers, or who work at licensed childcare providers are eligible to be vaccinated, regardless of age. The State of Maine's COVID -19 Response vaccin ation website provided hundreds of vaccinat ion sites through health care centers, pharmacies, and mobile vaccination units. Several Maine School Administrative Units (SAUs) also ser ve as vaccination sites. Appropriate accommodations for children with disabilities with respect to the health and safety policies Nothing in the Framework for Return to In - Person Instruction developed in consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Maine Center for Disease Control includes recommendations for schools and six requirements, such as physical distancing, mask wearing and other measures, to mitigate the risk of COVID -19 transmission within schools should be interpreted as preventing a school fr om making accommodations on an individualized basis as required by state or federal disabilities laws. ii. Any Statewide plans, policies, estimated timelines, and specific milestones related to reopening and operation of school facilities , including any mechanisms the SEA will use to track, monitor, or enforce their implementation ; Maine's Framework for Reopening Schools and Returning to In -Person Instruction is intended to assist Maine school administrative unit (SAU) in the work of reintegrating back to in-person, classroom instruction. Informed by Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, international models, and examples from across the US, the framework includes six requirements for protecting health and safety and many additional ideas, rec ommendations, resources and strategies to support a successful return to in -person instruction. The framework's six parts are Part I: Physical Health and Safety Considerations, Part II: Social, Emotional, Behavioral, and Mental Health Considerations, Part III: 21 Academic Programs and Student Learning Considerations, Part IV: Common Expectations for Hybrid and Remote Learning Models, and Part V: Additional considerations will continue to be updated as appropriate . The Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) will continue to provide updates to the Maine Counties' Risk of COVID -19 Spread for Schools i o inform and support local SAU decisions about w hether and how to bring students back into the classroom. These recommendations are advisory. The Maine CDC COVID -19 Response also provides a dashboard with COVID -19 cases by school. The Maine Department of Education released requirements and guidance for school reopening that prioritizes returning as many students as possible to in-person learning \u2014safely, following a comprehensive set of health and safety requirements. This guidance includes best practices developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other states. Because COVID19 is a novel disease, scientific literature is growing rapidly with new information emerging almost every day. Guidance will continue to evolve as the science develops. Official minimal requirements for schools are included as part of the Maine Department of Education's Framework for Returning to Classroom Instruction. No single action or set of actions will eliminate the risk of COVID -19 transmission, but taken together , the following health and safety measures can greatly reduce that risk. Schools should establish a culture of health and safety that focuses on regularly enforcing these important practices. The PK -12 and Adult Education Public Health Guidance can be foun d in Attachment B. The Maine Department of Education also supports a COVID -19 Toolkit that provides the latest info rmation about the Department's response to the public health emergency. See Attachment C for landing page of the COVID -19 Toolkit, which links browsers to multiple locations and resources. iii. To what extent the SEA and its LEAs consult with Federal, State, and local health officials . This description should include, if available, whether the SEA and its LEAs have received support for screening testing from their State or local health department based on funding awarded by the CDC ; and The Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of Maine Department of Education have participated in daily briefings with state emergency preparedness and Maine CDC officials during the pandemic. The Framework for Reopening Schools and Returning to In -Person Ins truction, which is designed to inform SAUs decisions about whether and how to bring students back to the classroom was developed in collaboration with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services and the Maine CDC. 22 The Maine Counties' Risk of COVID -19 Spread for Schools advisory continues to be updated on a two -two basis which aligns with the incubation period for COVID -19 and allows for greater stability in the trend data for small counties. On April 30, 2021, the Maine Department of Health and Huma n Services and the Maine Department of Education announced the application for the Maine K -12 Schools Pooled Testing Program was opened. This program is open to all any K -12 school administrative unit (SAU), public or private school and has an expected sta rt date of May 10th. SAUs that have a public Pre -K may be included in pool testing. The program is accepting applications on a rolling basis through the Fall of 2021 and will be offered to public and approved private schools that wish to start this spring, use it for summer school programming, and/or the beginning of the 2021 -2022 school year. This program is voluntary. Pooled PCR testing is an efficient way to test large groups of students and staff in schools on a weekly basis. Pooled PCR testing involves collecting swabs from small groups of students, (class cohort), placing the swabs in a common test tube together in a \"batch\" or \"pool\" with no Personal Identifiable I nformation (PII). The pooled sample is tested for the detection of SARS -CoV -2 (Covid -19). If a pool tests positive, the individuals in that pool (class cohort) will be tested using BinaxNOW or PCR testing. Any positive individual(s) would be sent home to begin a ten-day isolation period. iv. Any guidance , professional learning , and technical assistance opportunities the SEA will make a vailable to its LEAs. The Maine Department of Education's specialists offer regular and ongoing virtual office hours and professional development in several content areas and specialties. During these meetings, Department specialists are available to provide support and guidance regarding distance, hybrid and in -person learning and school supports, as well as to facilita te networking and resource sharing between educators and school staff. Many learning and networking opportunities are posted the Department's Professional Development Calendar. The Department also offers an ever -growing library of recorded webinars and ses sions to support educators, school staff, and administrators. The Profession Learning Webinar library is organized by topic area, see Attachment D with over a thousand videos and subscribers. 2. Safe Return to In-Person Instruction and Continuity of Services Plans : Describe how the SEA will ensure that its LEAs that receive ARP ESSER funds meet the requir ements in section 2001(i) of the ARP Act and the requirements relating to the ARP ESSER funds published in the Federal Register and available 23 to either: (a) within 30 days of receipt of the funds, develop and make publicly available on the LEA's website a plan for the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services, or (b) have developed and made publicly available on the LEA's w ebsite such a plan that meets statutory requirements before the enactment of the ARP Act, including : i. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan includes , or will be modified to include, the extent to which it has adopted policies and a description of any such policies on each of the strategies listed in table B1 ; ii. How the SEA will ensure that each LEA plan describes how it will ensure continuity of services including but not limited to s ervices to address the students' academic needs , and students' and staff social, emotional, mental health, and other needs, which may include student health and food services ; iii. How the SEA will ensure that the LEA periodically review s, no less frequently than every six months for the duration of the ARP ESSER grant period (i.e., through September 30, 2023) ,2 and revise s as appropriate, its plan, and how the SEA will ensure that the LEA seeks public input , and takes such input into account on (1) whether revisions are necessary and, if so, (2) the revisions to the plan ; and iv. Describe , to the extent the SEA collects it, information about LEA implementation , to the greatest extent practicable, of each element of the most up -to-date CDC guidance listed in table B1 and its LEAs' needs for support and technical assistance to implement strategies consistent , to the greatest extent practicable, with relevant CDC guidance . The Maine Counties' Risk of COVID -19 Spread for Schools developed by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) will continue to provide updates to inform and support local SAU decisions about whether and how to bring students back into the classroom. The tiered system that was implemented through the 2020 -2021 school year , which is based on a holistic assessment of quantitative and qualitative information that includes but is not limited to recent data on case rates, positivity rates, and syndromic data, will break down into three -color based categorizations by county: red, yellow, and green. Categoriza tion as \"red\" suggests that the county has a high risk of COVID -19 spread and that in -person instruction should not be conducted. Categorization as \"yellow\" suggests that that the county has an elevated risk of COVID -19 spread and that hybrid instruction m odels should be adopted. 2 ARP ESSER funds are subject to the Tydings ame ndment in section 421(b) of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1225(b), and are therefore available to SEAs and LEAs for obligation through September 30, 2024. Review and revisions of these plans, if necessary, are not required during the Tyd ings period. 24 Categorization as \"green\" suggests that the county has a relatively low COVID -19 risk and that in -person instruction can be adopted, although an SAU may opt for hybrid instruction if its buildings or readiness make adhering to base line requirements a challenge. With this tiered system , SAUs across Maine developed three reopening plans for school year 2020 -2021 that could be utilized depending on the Counties' Risk of COVID -19. Many reopening plans were linked on SAU website s and covered by local media outlet s. See Attachment E for a media outlet example. The Maine Department of Education has informed SAUs through priority notices sent directly to superintendents of the requirements in section 2001(i) of the American Re scue Plan Act (ARP) and the requirements relating to the APR Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds published in the Federal Register . In addition, the Maine Department of Education will provide technical assistance and support to SAUs related to the requ irements through office hours, technical assistance and detailed information on our website . Website links and other publicly available information will be collected in the ARP ESSE R application along with detailed information about the SAUs public comment period . The application will be reviewed by a team at the Department of Education who will verify that plans and public comment periods were observed. Safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services plans will be reviewed by the Office of Federal Emergency Relief Programs and departmental team members during the ARP ESSER application process to valid ate and confirm that plans have adopted policies and implemented CDC guidelines , been updated recently for sc hool year 2021 -2022 , and ensured continuity of services . The assurances , included in part 1 of the ARP ESSER application illustrated that the SAU would comply with all reporting requirements , which include s the periodicity review of the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services plans. C. Planning for the Use and Coordination of ARP ESSER Funds The Department recognizes that seeking input from diverse stakeholder s is essential to developing plans for the use of ARP ESSER funds that are responsive to the needs of students, families, and educators. In this section, SEAs will describe their plans for consultation and for coordinating the use of ARP ESSER funds with other resources to meet the needs of students. 1. SEA Consultation : Consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements , describe how the SEA engaged in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, and incorporated input into its plan, including , but not limited to : i. students; ii. families; iii. Tribes (if applicable); iv. civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations ); 25 v. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); vi. superintendents; vii. charter school leaders (if applicable); viii. teachers , principals, school leaders , other educators, school staff, and their unions; and ix. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, children experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory st udents, children who are incarcerated , and other underserved students . The description must include how the SEA provided the public the opportunity to provide input in the development of the plan , a summary of the input (including any letters of support) , and how the SEA took such input into account . At the onsite of planning for the ARP State Plan, the Maine Department of Education gather members from the groups above to brainstorm and generat e ideas for investments, projects and initiatives that align with the ARP federal requirements and support all students , especially those who are the furthest from opportunity . This brainstorming activity provided feedback that emerge d themes of unfinished learning, career exploration, workforce development, social - emotion and mental health, culturally responsive pedagogy, physical health and safety, facilities, transportation, equipment, and education workforce as priorities and needs. With the themes, the Maine Department of Education engaged in addit ional conversations to determine ways to align the ARP State Plan with the Department's strategic plan and the 10 -year state economic plan to leverage and sustain the investments committed to in the ARP State Plan. With the feedback and themes, the Maine D epartment of Education identified the most urgent needs for students are f eeling supported and safe while being challenged and engaged. The ARP State Plan's guiding commitments are diversity, equity, inclusion, access, and opportunity while focusing on the priorities. 2. Coordinating Funds : Describe to what extent the SEA has and will coordinate Federal COVID -19 pandemic funding and other Federal funding. This description must include: i. How the SEA and its LEAs 1) are using or have used prior to the submission of this plan and 2) plan to use following submission of this plan , Federal COVID -19 funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act and the CRRSA Act to support a safe return to and safely maximize in -person instruction, sustain these operations safely, and address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on individual student groups (including students from low -income families, children with disabilities, English learners, raci al or ethnic minorities, students 26 experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care , and migratory students ); Complete the table below or provide a narrative description. Table C1. Funding source Prior /current SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) Planned SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) ESSER I (CARES Act) MOOSE (Maine Opportunity for Online Sustained Education) Learning Module Library provides free access to a-synchronous, interdisciplinary, project -based learning modules aligned to the Maine Learning Results for all grades, PK -12 developed by Maine educators, curriculum leaders, and educational community organizations. The SEA obligated just under $ 2.8 million to provide anytime, anywhere learning options and resources for educators, students and their families . The SEA deployed a team of Department of Education Contact Tracers, retired nurses, to provide Maine schools with specialized supports throughout the contact tra cing process and The SEA requires that SAUs complete an application for use of the CARES ESSER funds. The application collects information about how the school determined the most important needs and provides project narratives with budgets. The m ajor themes of the SAUs CARES ESSER application are summer learning (just under $10 million), mental and social emotion health ( just over $1 million), and improvement in air quality and ventilation (just under $3.8 million). 27 Funding source Prior /current SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) Planned SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) communicate with and monitor close contacts of positive cases within Maine schools. The SEA obligated just under $1 million to support Maine schools and keep all students actively engaged in learning while mitigating the spread and effects of this pandemic. Maine's SAUs are required to complete an application illustrating projects that align to federal emergency relief funding GEER I (CARES Act) The pandemic brought to the forefront the drastic inequities caused by lack of connectivity for many k -12 students in Main e, with nearly 15% of Maine students unable to connect with teachers and classmates through technology. Maine's GEER application was submitted, articulating a plan to address the digital divide with their #ConnectKidsNow initiative. The SEA GEER funding supported universal connectivity to ensure 28 Funding source Prior /current SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) Planned SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) that all students had the opportunity to continue learning through online platforms regardless of geography or socio -economic status, and to receive instruction during the current suspension of classroom -based instruction . The SEA obligated just under $7.8 million to provide devices and connectivity for all students. In order to be responsive to critical staff shortages in Maine schools because of the pandemic, the Maine Department of Education, in collaboration with Maine Community College System and Eastern Maine Community College, developed the Learning Facilitator Program, a fast -track training program for paraprofessional level educators to expand, strengthen and support a high-quality educator workforce. The SEA obligated just over $1.8 million to support a week - long 3 -credit course with foundational elements of 29 Funding source Prior /current SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) Planned SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) classroom management and school culture and a combination of online work, professional learning community meetings, and a structured teaching apprenticeship (315 hours). ESSER II (CRRSA Act) The SEA continues to see the need for the team of Department of Education Contact Tracers to provide Maine schools with specialized supports throughout the contact tracing process and communicate with and monitor close contacts of positive cases within Mai ne schools. The SEA obligated just under $800,000 to continue support ing Maine schools while mitigating the spread and effects of this pandemic through summer 2021 and school year 2021 - 2022 . The SEA is planning to launch a subgrant opportunity for all Maine SAUs to identify and acquire a learning management system (LMS) . SAUs will conduct a needs assessment to determine priority areas, identify student needs, and develop a plan of how to self - select the appropriate LMS. With professional development an d an LMS that allows SAUs to plan, execute, and assess a specific learning process allowing for a personalized approach to education. The SEA is planning to obligate approximately $5 million to support SAUs implement an LMS starting in school year 2021 - 2022. The SEA requires that SAUs complete 30 Funding source Prior /current SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) Planned SEA and LEA uses (including funding amounts, if applicable) an application for use of the CRRSA ESSER funds. The application collects information about how the school determined the most important needs and provides project narratives with budgets. The major themes of the SAUs CRRSA ESSER application are summer learning (just over $34 million), mental , social emotion health (just over $1 1 million and transportation (just over $ 4.3 million) . GEER II (CRRSA Act) The SEA plans to continue to respond to the inequitable access to the human and internet connectivity that students face through continuing the universal connectively, the Learner Facilitator Program, and the MOOSE platform. ii. To what extent ESSER I and ESSER II funds have been awarded to LEAs and, if funds have not yet been made available to LEAs , when they will be . In addition, please provide any available information on the total dollar amounts of ESSER I and ESSER II funds that have been obligated but not exp ended by the SEA and its LEAs , including whether the SEA is able to track LEA obligations . The Maine Department of Education first alerted SAU s to the 31 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) through a news release on April 1, 2020. The Department wanted to inform SAUs that funding to mitigate some of the financial impacts of the pandemic were forth coming. In mid -April of 2020, a website was developed to begin collecting information and sharing relevant updates with SAUS. Shortly after the website launched SAUs received notification of their CARES ESSER allocations , based on the proportionate share of Title I. At the beginning of May 2020, the Maine Department of Education's School Finance Team began hosting office hours to support SAUs' federal programs coordinators and business managers by providing additional information around the CARES ESSER funding application preparations. The application was made available via the Maine Department of Education's Consolidated Application and Grant Reimbursement website on Monday, May 18, 2020 . As of June 1, 2021 , the Maine Department of Education has received 175 CARES ESSER applications out of 179 SAUs. Within, our electronic grant manag ement system the Maine Department of Education can track SAU reimbursements. The Consolidated Application and Grant Reimbursement system indicates that $9,899,784.14 of the CARES ESSER funds for SAUs has been invoiced while the remaining $30,325,456.58 has been earmarked in the CARES ESSER application. The Maine Department of Education first alerted SAUs to the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act through a news release on January 7, 2021 . The Department wanted to urge SAUs to prioritize the use of funds for addressing student needs, ascertaining and addressing learning loss, preparing schools for reopening, and repairing and upgrading air quality systems in school buildings . On January 22 , 2021, SAUs were notified of the CRRSA ESSER allocations and t he application was made available via the Maine Department of Education's Consolidated Application and Grant Reimbursement website on Monday, January 29, 2021 . As of June 1, 2021, the Maine Dep artment of Education has received 1 19 CRRSA ESSER applications out of 179 SAUs. Within our electronic grant management system, the Maine Department of Education can track SAU reimbursements. The Consolidated Application and Grant Reimbursement system indic ates that $ 2,410,205 .27 of the CRRSA ESSER funds for SAUs has been invoiced while the remaining $162,983,274.05 will been earmarked in the CRRSA ESSER application. iii. In supporting LEAs as they plan for the safe return to and continuity of in-person instruction and for meeting the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students resulting from the COVID -19 pandemic , the extent to which the SEA is also using other Federal funding sources including but not limited to under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 ( \"ESEA \"), IDEA, Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act ( \"WIOA \"), funding for child nutrition services, and McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance 32 Act, and the funds to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness provided by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act.3 The Maine Department of Education is supporting blended and braided with other federal, state and local funding sources to create a sustainable funding stra tegy and more effectively leverage multiple funding streams toward a common goal. Our teams , which include the ESEA Federal Programs, the School Finance Team, Office of Special Services and the McKinney -Vento Coordinator have created opportunities to discuss overlapping concerns and ways to identified statewide needs that might be supported with multiple funding sources to maximize the investment. The Department also provides additional information to our SAUs about braiding and blending funding to avoid the financial COVID cliff. D. Maximizing State -Level Funds to Support Students The Department recognizes that States have an extraordinary opportunity to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on underserved students through the ARP Act's required State set -asides to address the academic impact of lost instructi onal time, provide summer learning and enrichment programs, and provide comprehensive afterschool programs. In this section, SEAs will describe their evidence -based strategies for these resources. The Maine Department of Education (DOE) has been focused on equity and excellence for Maine's students, and on the health, safety and wellbeing of students, staff, and school communities throughout the public health emergency. The Department has been worki ng to ensure that school administrative units (SAUs) have the most updated information and necessary resources to prepare and support facilities, staff, students, and families. State Priorities The Maine DOE identified priorities through discussions with stakeholders and through the collection of ideas for investments that will create sustainable infrastructure through professional capacities, educational practices, and operational systems. The state priorities that emerged through these stakeholder discus sions and investment ideas were: 3 Please note that the needs of students experiencing homelessness must be addressed (along with the other groups disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic) through the use of the ARP ESSER SEA reservations and the required LEA rese rvation for the academic impact of lost instructional time; the funding provided to support the needs of students experiencing homelessness by section 2001(b)(1) of the ARP Act is in addition to the supports and services provided with ARP ESSER funds. 33 Unfinished Learning Education Workforce Career Exploration and Workforce Development Mental Health and Social Emotional Learning Physical Health and Safety Improvement to Facilities and Infrastructure These priorities provided the Maine DOE an opportunity to prioritize and expand a statewide focus on the whole student approach in our educational practice. The themes the Maine DOE will focus on through the whole student approach include: social -emotional learning, mental and behavioral health programs, restorative alternatives to exclusionary discipline, trauma -informed practices, student -centered learning through interdisciplinary project -based instruction, and related professional de velopment for educators and school leaders . With the themes, the Maine DOE engaged in additional consultation to align the ARP State Plan with the Department's strategic plan as well as the 10 -year State economic plan to leverage and sustain investments. Through stakeholder input the Maine DOE ident ified the most urgent needs for students, staff, educational leaders, and families are to feel supported and safe while being challenged and engaged . The Department will focus on the whole student approach with the guiding commitments, which are diversity, equity, inclusion, access , and opportunity . State Reservations The ARP Elementary and Secondary Schools Emergency Relief (ESSER) fund includes three state-level reservations for activities and interventions that respond to students' academic, social, and emotional needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on underrepresented student groups, including each major racial and ethnic group, children from low -income families, children with disabilities, English learners, gender, migrant students , students experiencing homelessness, and children and youth in foster care. The Maine DOE must reserve: $20,565,000 for the implementation of evidence -based interventions aimed specifically at addressing learning loss , such as summer learning or summer e nrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs. $4,113,000 for evidence -based summer enrichment programs . $4,113,000 for evidence -based comprehensive afterschool programs . $10,283,000 for emergency needs determined by the Department to address issues responding to COVID -19. 34 The Maine DOE is being intentional about each investment supported with the state reservation for summer learning and enrichment programs, evidence -based learning loss interventions, comprehensive afterschool programs, and emergency need responses to COVID 19. The Maine DOE will support investments that align to the allowable uses of the federal emergency relief funding and support the whole student approach which focuses on being hea lthy, engaged, challenged, and prepared all while feeling safe and supported. The Maine DOE developed an application process for the state reservation to help identify potential investments. The application was published widely within the Maine DOE and all teams were encouraged to submit a Reservation Application. The application required information about the internal and external partners; project timeline with narrative; project description; COVID -19 impact that will be addressed with this project; pr oject alignment to the Maine DOE's whole student approach; project goals and evaluation methods; and project budget narratives and allowability. Our team at the Maine DOE continues to review submitted applications and projects for alignment to the whole st udent approach and how the project responds to students' academic, social, and emotional needs while addressing the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on underrepresented student groups . The State has adopted a Uniform Chart of Accounts, a standard system of classifying agency financial information to fulfill the need for uniform, consistent terminology and classifications to be used for budgeting, accounting and reporting the financial ac tivities of the State. Chapter 75 of the State Administrative and Accounting Manual (SAAM) presents the State's uniform chart of accounts. For management purposes, agencies , such as the Maine Department of Education, maintain a more detailed level of accou nting data. Financial transactions are described by means of alphanumeric indicators which are assigned to descriptive titles. For all federal emergency relief programs, the Maine DOE has designated codes which include account type, department code, agency code, program code, fund code, object code, activity code and fiscal year. This detailed level of accounting allows for the Maine DOE to identify award amounts, obligations, encumbrances, subaward amounts and unobligated balances. Activity codes (ie. Ext ended Learning Opportunity - ELOP) and program codes ( ie. With the development of the activity code, which documents the expenses associated with a specific project, and the program code, which documents the specific line within the program budget the Maine DOE has the ability to track expenses for each requirement under ARP. 1. Academic Impact of Lost Instructional Time : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(1) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 5 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) on evidence -based interventions to address the academic impact of lost instructional time by supporting the implementation of evidence -based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or e xtended school year programs, and ensure that such interventions respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: 35 i. A description of the evidence -based interventions (e.g., providing intensive or high -dosage tutoring, accelerating learning ) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those interventions on an ongoing basis to understand if they are working ; The themes that emerged through the multiple wides pread discussions with stakeholders are unfinished learning, career exploration, workforce development, culturally responsive pedagogy, mental and social emotional health, improvement to facilities and transportation that promote health and safety and enha ncing the education workforce. The themes point to the development of a Whole Student approach and a statewide shift in educational practice. In addition to addressing short -term recovery needs, the Maine Department of Education will consider leveraging the ARP ESSER funding for potential long -term infrastructure investments. These investments can support systemic changes to ensure core resources needed to close opportunity gaps become more widely and routinely available. The Ma ine Online Opportuni ties for Sustained Education (MOOSE) was developed at the onset pandemic with additional modules being added to focus on cultural awareness specific to Maine's demographics. The free, asynchronous, high -quality, interdisciplinary, project -based learning modules are aligned to the Maine Learning Resul ts for all grades, PreK - 12 and developed by Maine educators, curriculum leaders, and educational community organizations. The Department's MOOSE interdisciplinary curr icular materials are available for educators to use to supplement and enhance their own curriculum for students who missed the most in -person instruction thus providing the students with engaging and skills reinforcing supplemental learning experiences. Th e MOOSE materials are also being integrated into the Making Access a Priority (MAP) Guide to Continuity of Learning. Each classroom on the MAP contains resources that have been created and curated to support Maine teachers as they navigate the teaching env ironment created by the pandemic. Additional MOOSE modules will be developed to provide anytime, anywhere learning options and resources for educators, students and their families . The asynchronous learning modules are aligned to Maine's Learning Results , provide clear goals and allows a student flexibility in their learning and the time need ed to engage in the learning. In Maine, Multi -tiered System of Support (MTSS) is defined as a comprehensive framework designed to address the academic, behavioral, an d social -emotional needs of each student in the most inclusive and equitable learning environment. MTSS is a whole - 36 school framework that organizes the people, programs and policies into an integrated support system that begins with a base layer that includ es strategic use of evidence -based practices, a consistent and effective implementation process, and available resources including people, time, and data. The Maine Department of Education will equip all schools with professional development and technical assistance in MTSS and the Whole Student practices. The Maine Department of Education is in the developmental phase of establishing an Extended Learning Program to support the development of extende d learning opportunities for students across the state and connect students to local industry employers. The goal is to develo p and strengthen the statewide career exploration opportunities for students in grades 7 -12. Program staff will design and provide professional development training to school personnel. They will also conduct focus group sessions to clearly identify the needs and opportunities in different regions of the state and enhance expanded learning opportunities and career exploration initiatives in all 16 counties in partnership with community organizations, businesses, and schools. The Child Development Services (CDS) system is an Intermediate Educational Unit that provides both Early Intervention for birth through two years of age a nd Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) for children three through five years of age. CDS is under the supervision of the Maine DOE. The CDS system ensures the provision of special education rules, federal and state regulations statewide, through a ne twork of regional sites. COVID -19 has dramatically impacted the provision of preschool education in Maine as a significant number of private preschools providers closed during the pandemic. Although unmet need existed for identified children in CDS pre -COV ID, the level of unmet need increased significantly in the pandemic, limiting the provision of FAPE to only 60% of the children eligible for services. CDS has responded by attempting to increase program options but there are approximately 250 children who still require services and the current infrastructure does not support the need. CDS is exploring partnerships with community providers and relationships with local SAUs to increase access to programming for identified children in CDS. Through a collaborat ion with the University of Maine System, CDS is developing a plan to transition CDS staff into SAUs and develop programming to support CDS staff in obtaining Teacher of Students with Disabilities (0 to age 5) certification. During the pandemic, students who are English learners (ELs) have faced a disproportionate impact in terms of their academic achievement, as well as their progress in becoming proficient in English. The Maine DOE identified the need to provide intensified supports to ensure that the im pact is mitigated to the greatest extent possible. To provide educational teams with immediate and actionable student -level data specific to English 37 language proficiency the Maine DOE will hire an educational specialist to support SAUs through the implemen tation of the WIDA MODEL and provide professional learning for assessment administrators and EL educators. The WIDA MODEL assessment is aligned to the state's summative English Language Proficiency measure (ACCESS for ELLs) and can inform instructional pla nning and guide instructional and curricular decisions. Through a partnership, the Maine DOE will facilitate six focused meetings and provide targeted trainings to SAUs and DOE staff on the implementation of bilingual programs enabling Maine schools to mak e the crucial shift away from English -only programming. The meetings and trainings will equip schools with the understanding and tools they need to support students' bilingual development to address unfinished learning in the most effective way possible. D ual-identified students, EL with Disabilities, have experienced an interruption in face -to-face language acquisition support and often a reduction of special education support. To support the unfinished learning of the dual -identified students, the Maine DOE will hire an educational specialist who will provide crucial support to educators implementing guidance on identification and services successfully. Adapting the evidence -based program, Focus on First (grade) and Focus on Second (grade ), will enable the Maine DOE to provide interdisciplinary, content integrated instructional programs aligned to Maine's state standards as open -source resources for Maine schools. Focus on First and Second programs provide intentional vertical alignment across the early elementary years while focusing on big ideas that grow the depth of students understanding and promote transfer of knowledge and skills over time, enabling schools to more seamlessly address gaps that can form during times of education disruption caused by the COVID -19 pandemics. Vertical alignment promotes opportunity to identify learning gaps and to accelerate learning more readily. The programs are built with culturally responsive materials and Maine teachers will be involved in the adaptation of these p rograms to ensure that they reflect Maine's context. The first and second grade programs will incorporate developmentally appropriate pedagogy that supports not only academic achievement but also social - emotional and executive function growth. The implications of disrupted schooling, alternate deliveries of educational programming and the stressors of COVID -19 on the education of students have had an additional impact on the reading abilities of students. It is likely that there are less student s able to demonstrate grade -level reading proficiency now than prior to the pandemic. In addition, the impacts on social emotional learning and resulting traumatic experiences for students and families exacerbate the need for additional strong relationship s with peers and mentors within schools and communities. The Teen Trendsetters and Book Explorers programs have proven to be effective to improve reading skills of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade students who are reading below 38 grade level through one -to-one mentor ing relationships with middle and high school students, access to grade level books and access to parent resources. Structured lessons within the programs target specifics skills with a goal to allow learners to move through planned activities with their mentor. The intended goal is to support learners in combining their knowledge of familiar skills with new skills that they can apply to all areas. Maine, like most of the nation, was experiencing an educator shortage, which has been exacerbated by the pan demic. To address this challenge, the Maine DOE will create subgrants, Teach Maine Grant , for SAUs to meet the unique educator workforce needs of their SAUs and will support students in recovering from the impact of COVID -19, by ensuring students have acce ss to strong and well -qualified educators. The Teach Maine Grant program relies on a human -centered design approach, underscoring the belief that those who are closest to the problem should be closest to the solution. The Teach Maine Grant will utilize a f unding formula that integrates both SAU educator data such as numbers of waivers, conditional certifications, new educators (1 -3 years' experience), number of open positions, and level of turnover along with SAU student data such as enrollment, Special Ed ucation students, 504 Services, Title 1 Services in ELA and mathematics, economic disadvantage, homelessness levels, English as a Second Language, Ethnic diversity, and rural schools. ii. How the evidence -based interventions will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to determine the impact of l ost instructional time ; and Models of aspira tional programs for pursuing careers and /or enrollment in post -secondar y education will particularly support students who are or w ere in foster care, who experienced homelessness, and who are from low-income families. Furthermore, such models may be adapted into IEP transition plans for secondary students who have disabi lities. Models of early career and technical education summer experiences for middle level students will demonstration how progr ams in career and technical education can address the ways in which gender stereotypes limit career aspirations for girls, boys, and students who identify as non -binary. 39 Models of curricular modules in MOOSE that address health and wellness , and career readiness , will embed learning about the ways gender stereotypes and expectations of conformity limit the social , emotional , and cognitive development of students of all genders and will provided needed models of education about healthy dating relationships, consent, harassment, and assault. Models of this kind will address needs of students who identify as LGBTQ+ as well as students for whom schools have traditionally b een unwelcoming due to local norms (perhaps u nsanctioned, but existing) about gendered roles and expectation as well as harassment based on gender expression of many kinds. Models of curricular modules in MOOSE that relate to African American history and culture will address curricular shortcomings that existed prior to the pandemic and were exacerbated by the pandemic. For example, curricular units that address the history and experiences of African Americans who are primarily descend ants for formerly enslaved people will benefit all students while also reflecting the experiences of several Maine students . Similarly, modules that address the history and experiences of families who are 20th and 21st century immigrants from African countries will also have their experiences reflected in curricular materials and serve as one way to make schools more welcoming to these students who have experienced high rates of absenteeism during the pandemi c. During the winter of 2021, the Department of Education's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) team met on an on -going basis and a subgroup of that team - the education sub -committee - secured funding for evening Professional Development sessions that wer e open to any educator in the state. In total, 9 evening sess ions on topics of anti -racist education, dem ystifying Islam (many recent immigrants to Maine are from countries in northern Africa and from Iraq) , understanding the effects of micro -aggressions on student learning , and understanding the history and current day experiences of Wabanaki people in Main e. Responses from surveys of the participants in these evening voluntary workshops indicated a clea r desire to learn more about the topics in the series the DEI group had named Be yond the Movement. Educators who participated in these workshops revealed they learned new aspects about t he needs and experiences of students of color in their schools, about h ow to sustain anti -oppressive work in schools even when few faculty members overtly participate in the work, and the importance of teaching empathy along with history and facts about the experiences of indigenous people. ARP ESSER funds will allow the DEI education team to contract with additional lecturers, national 40 presenters, local trainers, and even with the orig inal presenters in the Beyond the Movement series of 2021, to move b eyond the beginning stages of anti -oppressive educational practices to supp ort the learning of under -represented groups of students - especially students of ind igenous de scent, children of immigrant families, students of color , students who identify as LGBTQ+, and students from families with low -income. Furthermore, professional development from the DEI Education sub -committee will address the need for teachers and students to develop critical literacy and media s kills so that students and teachers both can\" read their world s\" to clearly see their place in it and to take action to improve their circumstances and those of others . Under-served students need and deserve access to the highest quality information and critical skills to evaluate messages and media; the pandemic has revealed the need to have residents and citizens aware of facts and evidence - based claims during a public health emergency. iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instruct ion when offered during school building closures . The Department's MOOSE interdis ciplinary curricular materials will be available for SAU educators to use to supplement and enhance their own curriculum for students who missed the most in -person instruction thus providing the students with engaging and skills - reinforcing supplemental learning experiences. Guidance from the Maine Department of Education communication, ARP Office Hours, and regional superintendents' meetings will highlight the Who le Student approach envisioned by the Commissioner of Education and will underscore ways that smaller class sizes supported by the grant will addre ss the unfinished learning experience d by students who had the most interruptions to their learning. 2. Evidence -Based Summer Learning and Enrichment Programs : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(2) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence -based summer learning and enrichment programs , including those that begin in Summer 2021 , and ensure such programs respond to students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs that address the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of students 41 (e.g., providing intensive or high -dosage tutoring, accelerating learning ) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs ; Communication about the efficacy of Summer Learning programs has been delivered to SAUs via priority notices and sta keholder meetings. SAUs that provide summer enrichment programs either as an exten sion of their own educational program or through contracts with community partners will report back to the Maine Department of Education data on the number of participants and goals of the program. Qualitative data in the form of quotes from participants, news stories about the summer programs, samples of students' projects, summary reports from site directors, or survey comments from parents will round out the indivi dual SAU evaluation. On a larger scale, statewide and SAU specific data the Department collects about attendance, suspensions and exp ulsions, graduation rates, and educator turnover/persistence will be examined to n ote any positive trends both as a whole and by identi fied student and educator groups for which data are collected. This summer, the Maine DOE partnered with summer learning and enrichment programs who have a memorandum of understanding with SAUs who committed or agree to commit to pooled PCR testing for COVID -19. This project pro vided subgrants to community -based organizations to increase staff, purchase personal protection equipment, and provide transportation. The intention of this investment was to reduce the barriers, like transportation and limited enrollment, to be able to p rovide enrichment opportunities for vulnerable students. The Maine DOE is establishing an Extended Learning Program to support the development of extended learning opportunities for students across the state and connect students to local industry employe rs through a credit recovery program. The goal is to develop and strengthen the statewide career exploration opportunities for students in grades 7 -12, while students gain knowledge and skills through community and work -based organization partnerships. Pro gram staff will deliver professional learning to school personnel and conduct focus group sessions to clearly identify the needs and opportunities in the different regions of the state. Models of aspirational programs for pursuing careers and/or enrollment in post -secondary education will particularly support students who are or were in foster care, who experienced homelessness, and who are from low -income families. Furthermore, such models may be adapted into IEP transition plans for secondary students who have disabilities. 42 The Maine DOE will establish a summer arts -immersion experience for students who may struggle to connect with curricula through traditional means. The program will focus on unfinished learning, deliver rigorous academic intervention a nd a character education program through drama -based learning. In addition, the literacy initiative focuses on self -discovery, positive core values, and 21st -Century skills to address student mental health, and social emotional learning. The Maine DOE will provide professional learning models to promote a positive growth mindset for educators. It is well established in the research that migrant students are facing significant unmet needs in their communities, and those needs are even more exacerbated by th e COVID -19 pandemic. The established Blueberry Harvest School, an evidence -based summer learning and enrichment program, is a support program that aims to improve students' mental health, social emotional learning, physical health, sense of belonging, and simultaneously, academic outcomes. The Maine DOE will increase transportation to allow more eligible migrant children to attend the Blueberry Harvest School by adding additional transportation routes to cover outlining areas that families have relocated to . The additional transportation will open this opportunity to more migrant students in the area and contribute to all students having a safe and supported experience in Maine's schools. ii. How the evidence -based programs will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3. i.--viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of summer learning and enrichment programs ; and Summer programming and high-quality tutoring during the school year or during summer programming will address unfinished learning in nearly all groups that have faced disproportionate impact from COVID -19. SAUs can utilized ARP ESSER funding for summer programming and enrichment p rograms fo r all students but can also utilize this funding blended with other Federal Funding to enhance programming for students furthest from opportunity. iii. The extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; and 2) 43 students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school building closures . Guidance from the Maine Department of Education communication, ARP Office Hours, and regional superintendents' meetings will highlight the Whole Student approach envisioned by the Commissioner of Education and will promote interdisciplinary student -centere d instruction and enrichment learning opportunities. 3. Evidence -Based Comprehensive Afterschool Programs : Describe how the SEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(f)(3) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 1 percent of the State's total allo cation of ARP ESSER funds ) for evidence -based comprehensive afterschool programs (including, for example, before -school programming) , and ensure such programs respond to students' academic, social, emotional , and mental health needs . The description must include: i. A description of the evidence -based programs (e.g., including partnerships with community -based organizations) the SEA has selected, and the extent to which the SEA will evaluate the impact of those programs ; In Maine, the Depart ment of Education acknowledges the authority and responsibility local school districts must select local or reginal partnerships. The Department will encourage partnersh ips with community organizations that understand the needs of participating students well and who follow civil rights and non -discriminatory guidelines. SAUs will report data on the number of participants and goals of the program. Qualitative data in the form of quotes from participants, news stories about the summer programs, summary reports from site directors, or survey comments from parents will round out the individual SAUs evaluation of the community partnership. On a larger scale, state -wide and SAU specific data the Department collects about attendance, suspensions and expulsions, graduation rates, and educator turnover/persistence will be examined to note any positive trends as a whole and by identified student groups for which data are collected. The Office of Federal Emergency Relief Progr ams will collaborate with the State Coordinator for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers to identify overlapping opportunities afterschool opportunities statewide. The Maine DOE's objective is to be able to expand afterschool programs as well as pro vide additional subgrants to areas of Maine that are not currently served. Maine DOE will supplement and support this important work through a 44 request for proposal application process for community -based organizations that have an established partnership w ith a SAU. The Maine DOE will establish an afterschool arts -immersion experience for students who may struggle to connect with curricula through traditional means. The program will focus on unfinished learning, deliver rigorous academic intervention and a character education program through drama -based learning. In addition, the literacy initiative focuses on self -discovery, positive core values, and 21st -Century skills to address student mental health, and social emotional learning. The Maine DOE will pr ovide professional learning models to promote a positive growth mindset for educators. The Maine DOE is establishing an Extended Learning Program to support the development of extended learning opportunities for students across the state and connect stude nts to local industry employers through a credit recovery program. The goal is to develop and strengthen the statewide career exploration opportunities for students in grades 7 -12, while students gain knowledge and skills through community and work -based organization partnerships. Program staff will deliver professional learning to school personnel and conduct focus group sessions to clearly identify the needs and opportunities in the different regions of the state. Models of aspirational programs for pursu ing careers and/or enrollment in post -secondary education will particularly support students who are or were in foster care, who experienced homelessness, and who are from low -income families. Furthermore, such models may be adapted into IEP transition pla ns for secondary students who have disabilities. How the evidence -based programs will specifically address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A.3.i.-viii. When possible, please indicate which data sources the SEA will use to identify students most in need of comprehensive afterschool programming; and The Maine Department of Education will encourage SAUs to reduce the barrier s for students furthe st from the opportunity to participate in afterschool programming by helping SAUs in identifying the what the challenges might be delivery method, operational hours, and/or lack of transpo rtation. ii. the extent to which the SEA will use funds it reserves to identify and engage 1) students who have missed the most in -person instruction 45 during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; and 2) students who did not consistently participate in remote instructio n when offered during school building closures . Guidance from the Maine Department of Education communication, ARP Office Hours, and regional superintendents' meetings will highlight the Whole Student approach envisioned by the Commissioner of Educati on and will promote interdisciplinary student -centered instruction and enrichment learning opportunities. 4. Emergency Needs : If the SEA plans to reserve funds for emergency needs under section 2001(f)(4) of the AR P Act to address issues responding to the COVID -19 pandemic , describe the anticipated use of those funds, including the extent to which these funds will build SEA and LEA capacity to ensure students' and staff's health and safety ; to meet students' academic , social, emotional, and mental health needs ; and to use ARP ESSER funds to implement evidence -based interventions . The Maine Department of Education has identified yearlong needs and priorities through meaningful dialogue with professionals in the field, advocacy organizations, interdepartmental committees, Department of Economic and Community Development, Maine Department of Labor, and Maine DHHS to unite the Department's initiatives with other statewide efforts that are aligned with national prior ities and efforts. The funds that are being reserved for emergency needs will be earmarked for mental health support for educators, professional learning in trauma -informed practices, statewide diversity, equity and inclusion support, COVID pool testing, a nd the expansion of the school nutrition programs and supports. The themes that emerged as priorities through our conversations with the widespread stakeholder have encouraged the Department to be sure that students are healthy, safe, engaged, supported, c hallenged and prepared through investments in structures, human capital, systems and practices. The Maine DOE will partner with Maine's Department of Health and Human Services to increase School -based health centers (SBHC) throughout the state. SBHC care i s a powerful tool for achieving health equity among children and adolescents who unjustly experience disparities in outcomes simply because of their race, ethnicity, or family income. SBHCs keep students in school and minimizes the amount of instructional time lost to illness because medical, behavioral, dental, and vision care is provided directly in schools, so all young people have an equal opportunity to learn and grow while ensuring access to high -quality preventive or acute care services. A SBHC repre sents a partnership between school(s) and a community health organization(s) with the 46 objective to give students meaningful access to care in a location that is safe and convenient. Onsite health care professionals will collaborate with schools to address the broad range of concerns and adverse experiences that affect students' healthy development. The COVID -19 pandemic has highlighted the need for current data regarding students, staff, and school facilities in order to make functional policy decisions. The constant need for updated data has resulted in surveys and ad -hoc data collections from several state agencies and constant requests to SAUs for more information. This project will allow the Maine DOE data team to work closely with SAUs to determine th e barriers that are in place to utilizing existing technologies and create plans that integrate targeted technical assistance to overcome those barriers. E. Supporting LEAs in Planning for and Meeting Students' Needs The Department recognizes that the safe return to in -person instruction must be accompanied by a focus on meeting students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs, and by addressing the opportunity gaps that existed before - and were exacerbated by - the pandemic. In this section, SEAs will describe how they will support their LEAs in developing high -quality plans for LEAs' use of ARP ESSER funds to achieve these objectives. 1. LEA Plans for the Use of ARP ESSER Funds : Describe what the SEA will require its LEAs to include in LEA plans consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements for the use of ARP ESSER funds , how the SEA will require such plans to be made available to the public , and the deadline by which the LEA must submit its ARP ESSER plan (which must be a reasonable timeline and should be within no later than 90 days after receiving its ARP ESSER allocation ). The LEA plans must include, at a minimum: i. The extent to which and how the funds will be used to implement prevention and mitigation st rategies that are, to the greatest extent practicable, in line with the most recent CDC guidance, to operate schools continuously and safely for in -person learning; ii. How the LEA will use the funds it reserves under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act (totaling not less than 20 percent of the LEA's total allocation of ARP ESSER funds) to address the academic impact of lost instructional time through the implementation of evidence -based interventions, such as summer learning or summer enrichment, extende d day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs; iii. How the LEA will spend its remaining ARP ESSER funds consistent with section 2001(e) (2) of the ARP Act ; and 47 iv. How the LEA will ensure that the interventions it implements , includin g but not limited to the interventions under section 2001(e)(1) of the ARP Act to address the academic impact of lost instructional time , will respond to the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students, and particularly those stude nts disproportionately impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic, including students from low -income families, students of color, English learners, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, and migratory students. The Maine Department of Education uses an electronic grant management system for ESEA Federal Programs, IDEA, CTE Perkins, and other Federal Emergency Programs. The electronic grant management system allows the Department to collect detailed and sp ecific information from the SAUs related to the uses of the ARP ESSER funds. The ARP ESSER application will be administered as a two -part application process. Part 1 of the application, accessed at www.4pcamaine.org, requires each SAU to certify terms, conditions, and assurances. Upon completion of part 1, the Department provided notification of substantial approval status consistent with 34 CFR \u00a776.708 of Uniform Grants Guidance (UGG). This initial level of approval means that a SAU can begin obl igating funds with a strong understanding of the ARP ESSER allowability. The Department highlighted that 40 the SAU will only be reimbursed for approved projects and budgets that were deemed allowable, necessary, and reasonable within part 2 of the applica tion. Part 2 of the application will be available by the end of June. This part will require detailed project and budgetary information related to preparing for, preventing, and responding to the pandemic, which will be reviewed by the Office of Federal Em ergency Relief Programs. In addition, the ARP ESSER application requires SAUs to provide detailed information about the required public comment period, the strategies utilized to address the academic impact of lost instructional time, and the evidence -based interventions. 2. LEA Consultation : Describe how the SEA will, in planning for the use of ARP ESSER funds, ensure that , consistent with the ARP ESSER requirements ], its LEAs engage in meaningful consultation with stakeholders, including, but not limited to: i. students; ii. families; 48 iii. school and district administrators (including special education administrators); and iv. teachers, principals, school leaders, other educators, school staff, and their unions. The LEA must also engage in meaningful consultati on with each of the following to the extent present in or served by the LEA: i. Tribes; ii. civil rights organizations (including disability rights organizations); and iii. stakeholders representing the interests of children with disabilities, English learners, child ren experiencing homelessness, children and youth in foster care, migratory students, children who are incarcerated, and other underserved students. The description must also include how the SEA will ensure that LEAs provide the public the opportunity to p rovide input in the development of the LEA's plan for the use of ARP ESSER funds and take such input into account. The Maine Department of Education will host office hours and technical assistance that will provide SAUs with the requirements and obligatio ns within the ARP Act. The Department will support SAUs to identify ways and groups that should be consult ed with. In addition, the ARP ESSER application will require that the SAUs describe their consultation process and the stakeholders for which they eng aged in meaningful consultation with. The Department will also be collecting information related to the timeframe , method, and advertisement of the public comment period along with the type of feedback that was provided . 3. Describe how the SEA will support and monitor its LEA s in using ARP ESSER funds. The description must include: i. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs' implementation of evidence -based interventions that respond to students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs , such as through summer learning or summer enrichment, extended day, comprehensive afterschool programs, or extended school year programs - including the extent to which the SEA will collect evidence of the effectiveness of interventions employed; The Maine Department of Education will support SAUs through professional learning that focuses on ensuring all students have equal opportunities and that every student will achieve and be challenged by rigorous curricula. The Office of Federal Emergency Re lief Programs will also partner with the Office of Innovation, the 21st Century Community Learning Center Program Coordinator, the Standards and Instructional Support teams to provide multiple widespread occasions to support evidence -based interventions th at respond to students' academic needs. 49 The Maine Department of Education will utilize the electronic grant management system which will contain the ARP ESSER application but also an ARP ESSER performance report. On part 1 of the ARP ESSER application, t he Department required to attest that the SAU will comply with all reporting requirements at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Maine Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Education, Inspector General and/or any oth er agency, commission, or department may reasonably require. On the APR ESSER performance report, SAUs will need to provide follow up related to goals, objectives, and outcomes. ii. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in specifically addressing t he disproportionate impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on certain groups of students, including each of the student groups listed in question A .3.i.-viii; and The Office of Federal Emergency Relief Programs will collaborate with the Office of Schools and Student Support, the Office of Special Services and Child Developmental Services to ensure that all students have equitable opportunities through additional programing. It will also be important to provide opportunities for school leaders to have the space and time to work on tasks collaboratively that are directly connected to school and district goals. In addition, it will be important to have school leaders involved in opportunities to learn from and be supported by a diverse network of peers, which the Department has created with our office hours, working groups, and associations. iii. How the SEA will support and monitor its LEAs in using ARP ESSER funds to identify, reengage, and support students most likely to have experienced the impact of lost instructional time on student learning, such as: a. Students who have missed the most in -person instruction during the 2019 -2020 and 2020 -2021 school years; b. Students who did not consistently participate in remote instruction when offered during school buildi ng closures; and c. Students most at -risk of dropping out of school. The Maine Department of Education's Office of Federal Emergency Relief Programs with work with the Educational Data Team to collect information about student enrollment and attendance, so the Department can provide additional support to SAUs with students who have missed in -person instruction and remote instruction. The 50 Department will utilize the data collected through surveys and required reporting to continuously inform the needs of students and SAUs while adapting to be sure those needs are addressed. 4. Describe the extent to which the SEA will support its LEAs in implementing additional strategies for taking educational equity into account in expending ARP ESSER funds, including but not limited to: i. Allocating funding both to schools and for districtwide activities based on student need, and ii. Implementing an equitable and inclusive return to in -person instruction. An inclusive return to in -person instruction includes, but is not limited to, establishing policies and practices that avoid the over-use of exclusionary discipline measures (including in - and out - of-school suspensions) and creating a positive and supportive learning environment for all students . The Maine Department of Education will continue to communicate with Maine sc hool superintendents, principals, special education administrators, curriculum leaders, and unionized teacher the importance of educational equity when utilizing the ARP ESSER funds. The Office of Feder al Emergency Relief Programs will also be reviewing th e ARP ESSER application to confirm that districtwide and school projects are based on student needs identified in the comprehensive needs' assessment. F. Supporting the Educator Workforce The Department recognizes the toll that the COVID -19 pandemic has taken on the Nation's educators as well as students. In this section, SEAs will describe strategies for supporting and stabilizing the educator workforce and for making staffing decisions that will support students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs. 1. Supporting and Stabilizing the Educator Workforce : i. Describe the extent to which the State is facing shortages of educators, education administration personnel, and other school personnel involved in safely reopening schools, and the extent to which they vary by region/type of school district and/or groups of educators (e.g., special educators and related services personnel and paraprofessionals ; bilingual or English as a second language educators ; science, technology, engineering, and math ( \"STEM \") educators ; career and technical education (\"CTE\") educators; early childhood educators). Cite specific data on shortages and needs where available. 51 Each year, states are required to submit proposals for teacher shortage areas to the United States Department of Education. The Maine Department of Education uses one of the approved methodologies from the United States Department of Education to determin e designated shortage areas. The Maine Department of Education compares the number and percentage of positions in each discipline filled by teachers who are not fully certified in the field they are teaching to the total number of full time equivalent (FT E) working in those that discipline/content area. This number is not to exceed 5% of the total FTEs for the state of Maine. From there, the proposed shortage areas are shared for public comment. Stakeholders from across the state are asked to provide input on the proposed shortage areas and submit additional shortage areas for consideration. Over the past two years, feedback from the public comment period has primarily been focused on the shortage in Special Education. While the teacher short age report is one source of data, it does not specifically address the gaps in specific content areas or geographic regions. In addition, this report does not include particular administrative position classifications (e.g., counselor, media specialist, p rincipal, and other roles).\" Maine's Teacher Shortage report is Attachment F. Based on the methodology used, the identified shortage areas in Maine for 2020 -2021 are : o Science: General Science 5 -8; Science Physical Science 7 - 12; Life Sciences 7 -12 o Mathematics 7 -12 o Career and Technical Education: Food Production Manager; Carpentry; Welding, Brazing and Soldering; Agricultural Business and Production Business administration and Management; Computer technology; Machine Tool/Machine d Care Plumbing; Public Safety/Protective Services; Forestry Products and Processing; Emergency Medical Services and Technology; Transportation Careers; Auto Body Repair/Collision Repair Technician; Diesel Maintenance/Occupat ions; Health and Medical Occupations; Building Maintenance; Electrical Occupations o Health and Physical Sciences Pre -K-12 o Academically Advanced Gifted Education Pre -K-12 o Early Childhood - Pre-K Age below o English as a Second Language Pre -K-12 o Art and M usic Education Theatre Pre -K-12; Art Pre -K-12; and 52 o World Languages: French Pre -K; Spanish Pre -K-12; Italian Pre -K-12; Latin Pre -K-12. To better support the needs of conditionally certified special educators, the Maine D epartment of Education implemented Maine's Alternative Certification and Mentoring Program in collaboration with the University of Maine . This program connects new special educators with mentorship and job -embedded coursework and have the following goals: Support conditionally certified special educators during their first year of practice , Work with SAUs Educational collaboratives to develop special educator mentoring capacity across the state and Develop and make available mentor training and professional development resources for LEAs and educational collaboratives . The Office of Special Services also off ered office hours and professional learning opportunities to special educators throughout the pandemic in order to provide timely support. The Department will collaborate with Maine's teacher educators who work in both public and private institutions of higher education to discuss ways and develop models to encourage teacher certification candidates to remain in the state to teach and to encourage and support candidates from under -represented groups to persist with teacher preparation programs and eventually teach in Maine's schools. Teachers who reflect the diversity of Maine's student body will effectively support the recover y of un finished learning of students of color , students who identify as LGBTQ+ , and English learners into the next several years. ii. Describe how the SEA will assist its LEAs in identifying the most urgent areas of shortages or potential shortages, with plans for individual LEAs facing the most significant needs (e.g., by avoiding layoffs, providing high -quality professional learning opportunities , and addressing the impact of stress or trauma on educators) . Include a description of how other Federal COVID -19 funding (e.g., ESSER and GEER funds under the CARES Act and CRRSA Act) have already been used to avoid layoffs during the COVID -19 pandemic . In the past, the Joint Standing Committee on Education and Cultural Affairs within the Maine State Legislature has requested that the Maine Education Policy Institute (MEPRI) conducted various studies to investigate teacher shortages and retention in Maine . The MEPRI study along with the Maine Department of Education's Office of Certification & Credentialing, the Educator Preparation Program, and Educator Excellence, Recruitment and Retention Program will continue to assist in identifying teacher 53 shortages and support SAUs through the emergency teacher certification and alternative pathways to certification. The Maine Department of Education continues provide meaningful, job -embedded and responsive professional learning and to evaluate the education profess ion through Recognizing Inspirational School Employees (RISE) Award which honors and promotes the excellence exhibited by classified school employees who provide exemplary service to students in pre -kindergarten through high school , and Maine Teacher of th e Year Award (TOY) to honor and recognize excellence in teaching, and highlight the importance and impact of the profession . The Maine Department of Education supports teachers' professional leaning by providing scholarships for t eachers to achieve certification through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS ). Scholarships are prioritized for teachers who are employed in a school in which at least 50% or more students qualify for free or reduced lunch, or who work in an identified shortage area. To support retention of highly effective educators, the Maine D epartment of Education provides an annual $3,000 Salary Supplement to National Board -Certified Teachers who are employed in a school in which less than 50% of students qualify for free or reduced lunch, and an annual $5,000 Salary Supplement for National Board-Certified Teachers who are employed in a school in which 50% or more students qualify for free or reduced lunch. Many SAUs' CARES ESSER and CRRSA ESSER application included salaries for additional services related to cleaning and custodial support, i ncrease in transportation and drivers need to follow spacing guidelines, supplementary support for health screening and monitoring, and educational support to engage in academic instructional practice and inventions such as summer learning and after school programming. iii. Describe the actions the SEA will take to fill anticipated gaps in certified teachers for the start of the 2021 -2022 school year and to what extent the SEA will further support its LEAs in expanding the educator pipeline and educator diversity while addressing the immediate needs of students disproportionately impacted by the pandemic (e.g., recruiting teaching candidates to provide high dosage tutoring or implementing residencies for teacher candidat es). The Maine Department of Education will continue to take use the additional flexibility for educator certification detailed by Executive Order # 7 FY 20/21 entitled \"An Order Regarding Pre -K-12 54 Education,\" signed by Governor Mills. As some school organizati ons across the state work to employ enough educators to meet the additional demands on education because of COVID -19, this executive order extends the Department's support of those SAUs. The new certificates shall be employed only as necessary to meet an i dentified staffing shortage and shall not be used to supplant persons who meet the underlying standards and are available and willing to work. The emergency teacher certification is effective through September 1, 2021. A holder of this certificate must hav e a cleared background check (CHRC) and participate in a mentoring program. 2. Staffing to Support Student Needs : Describe the extent to which the SEA has developed or will develop strategies and will support its LEAs in increasing student access to key support staff within school buildings , including school counselors, special education personnel, nurses, social workers, and psychologists (e.g., hiring additional personnel or freeing up these staff to focus on providing services to students) . The Maine Department of Education, in partnership with the Maine Community College system, launched the Learning Facilitator Program in the fall of 2020 supported with funding from the Governor's Emergency Education Relief fund. The purpose of the program was to address an immediate need for support staff in schools across Maine. The program is provided at no cost to participants and includes a boot camp, micro -credentialing, communities of practice, and school pla cements. Participants who successfully complete the programming are eligible for educational technician certifications. Federal funding was leveraged to support the coursework and placements of over 100 educator support. The Department intends to build upon the success of the first cohort and offer additional programming for the 2021-2022 school year. In addition, the Maine Department of Education's Office of Federal Emergency Relief Programs and the School Finance Team will work to support SAUs thro ugh the maintenance of effort and the maintenance of equity. The Office of Federal Emergency Relief Programs will highlight the array of allowable uses of the ARP ESSER funding and providing SAUs will information related to positions and services that can take advantage of the ARP ESSER funding. 55 G. Monitoring and Measuring Progress The Department recognizes that transparency on how ARP ESSER funds are used and their impact on the Nation's education system is a fundamental responsibility of Federal, State, and local government . In this section, SEAs will describe how they are building capacity at the SEA and LEA le vels to ensure high-quality data collection and reporting and to safeguard funds for their intended purposes. 1. Capacity for Data Collection and Reporting : It is im portant for an SEA to continuously monitor progress and adjust its strategies , as well as to support its LEAs in making adjustments to LEA strategies, based on impact . Describe how the SEA will ensure its capacity and the capacity of its LEAs to collect data on reporting requirements, including but not limited to the examples of reporting requirements described in the SEA's Grant Award Notification (listed in Appendix B). Describe the SEA's capacity and strategy to collect data from its LEAs (disaggregated by student group , where applicable) , to the greatest extent practicable , including any steps the SEA will take to build its capacity in the future (which may include the use o f ARP ESSER and other Federal COVID -19 pandemic funds at the SEA a nd LEA levels) , on issues that may include the following: i. Student learning , including the academic impact of lost instructional time during the COVID -19 pandemic ; ii. Opportunity to learn measures (e.g., chronic absenteeism ; student engagement ; use of exclusionary discipline; access to and participation in advanced coursework ; access to technology , including educator access to professional development on the effective use of technology ; access to high -quality educators ; access to school counselor s, social workers, nurses, and school psychologists; and results from student, parent, and/or educator surveys ); iii. Fiscal data that is comparable across the State (e.g., per-pupil expenditures at the LEA and school levels) ; iv. Jobs created and retained (by position type); v. Participation in programs funded by ARP ESSER resources (e.g., summer and afterschool programs ); and vi. Other reporting requirements reasonably required by the Secretary (please refer to Appendix B of this template; final requirements will be issued separately ). The Maine Department of Education uses an electronic grant management system for Federal Emergency Programs. The electronic grant management system allows the Department to collect detailed and specific information from the SAUs related to the uses of the ARP ESSER funds. 56 2. Monitoring and Internal Controls : Describe how the SEA will implement appropriate fiscal monitoring of and internal controls for the ARP ESSER funds (e.g., by updating the SEA's plan for monitoring funds and internal controls under the CARES and CRRSA Acts ; addressing potential sources of waste, fraud, and abuse; conducting random audits ; or other tools ). In this response, please describe the SEA's cur rent capacity to monitor ARP ESSER ; steps , if needed, to increase capacity ; and any foreseeable gaps in capacity , including how the SEA will provide its LEAs with technical assistance in the anticipated areas of greatest need . The Office of Federal Emergency Relief Programs will wo rk with the Office of School Finance's Fiscal Review and Compliance Team , which is responsible for developing and coordinating fiscal compliance with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements to support our SAUs with records management and auditing requirements . The Maine Department of Education has recently updated the Federa l Grant Management Handbook, Fiscal Guidance for Federal Grant Programs which is provided to all SAUs engaging with federal funding. In addition to Federal Grant Management Handbook, the Maine Department of Education, and the sub -recipients, SAUS, are bond by Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) , Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR), and the Feder al Uniform Grant Guidance (2 CFR, Part 200). The sub -recipient is required to permit the Maine Department of Education and auditors to have access to records and financial statements as necessary for the Maine Department of Education requirements per 2 CF R \u00a7200.331. Sub - recipients must comply with all reporting requirements including those in Section 15011(b)(2) of Division B of the CARES Act, Performance and Financial Monitoring and Reporting in 2 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 200.327 -329, and submit required quarterly repor ts, at such time and in such manner and containing such information as the U.S. Secretary of Education may reasonably require in the future. The Maine Department of Education's Office of Federal Emergency Relief Programs is responsible for the oversight a nd monitoring of programs and activities carried out under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Elementary and Seconda ry School Emergency Relief (ESSER) . The General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) requires that each state \"adopt and use proper methods of administering each applicable program, including monitoring of agencies, institutions, and organizations responsible for carrying out each program.\" 57 Monit oring procedures must be designed to promote the recipient's progress in achieving program goals and objectives; adherence to laws, regulations and assurances governing the program and conformity to the approved ARP ESSER application, performance reports o r other relevant documents. Likewise, Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) requires the Maine Department of Education to monitor grants to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance goals are bein g achieved. The Office of Federal Emergency Relief Programs will continue to annually monitor SAUs for effective implementation of ARP ESSER programs and compliance with applicable statutory requirements. Additionally, the office will utilize this process to provide meaningful technical assistance to those SAUs in need of additional supports. This structure will allow the office to build relationships with district and school leaders; ensure accountability to federal statute requirements ; and to maximize the use of all federal resources to increase student achievement. Monitoring will cover requirements specific to CARES ESSSER, CRRSA ESSER and ARP ESSER . The process will include questions and conversation of a more systemic nature, as it is expected that decisions on how ARP ESSER funds are expended are made within the framework of the districts for identify student needs, especially those who are the furthest from opportunity . 58 Appendix A: School Operating Status and Instructional Mode Data Template Indicate the date or time period represented by the following data.

This provision is Section 427 of GEPA, enacted as part of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law (P.L.) 103 -382). To Whom Does This Provision Apply? Section 427 of GEPA affects applicants for new grant awards under this program. ALL APPLICANTS FOR NEW AWARDS MUST INCLUDE INFORMATION IN THEIR APPLICATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS NEW PROVISION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. (If this program is a State -formula grant program, a State needs to provide this description only for projects or activities that it carries out with funds reserved for State - level uses. In addition, local school distri cts or other eligible applicants that apply to the State for funding need to provide this description in their applications to the State for funding. The State would be responsible for ensuring that the school district or other local entity has submitted a sufficient section 427 statement as described below.) What Does This Provision Require? Section 427 requires each applicant for funds (other than an individual person) to include in its application a description of the steps the applicant proposes to tak e to ensure equitable access to, and participation in, its Federally - assisted program for students, teachers, and other program beneficiaries with special needs. This provision allows applicants discretion in developing the required description. The stat ute highlights six types of barriers that can impede equitable access or participation: gender, race, national origin, color, disability, or age. Based on local circumstances, you should determine whether these or other barriers may prevent your students, teachers, etc. from such access to, or participation in, the Federally -funded project or activity. The description in your application of steps to be taken to overcome these barriers need not be lengthy; you may provide a clear and succinct description o f how you plan to address those barriers that are applicable to your circumstances. In addition, the information may be provided in a single narrative, or, if appropriate, may be discussed in connection with related topics in the application. Section 427 is not intended to duplicate the requirements of civil rights statutes, but rather to ensure that, in designing their projects, applicants for Federal funds address equity concerns that may affect the ability of certain potential beneficiaries to fully participate in the project and to achieve high standards. Consistent with program requirements and its approved application, an applicant may use the Federal funds awarded to it to eliminate barriers it identifies. 68 What are Examples of How an Applicant Might Satisfy the Requirement of This Provision? The following examples may help illustrate how an applicant may comply with Section 427. (1) An applicant that proposes to carry out an adult literacy project serving, among others, adults with limited English proficiency, might describe in its application how it intends to distribute a brochure about the proposed project to such potential participants in their native language. (2) An applicant that proposes to develop instructional materials for classroom use might describe how it will make the materials available on audio tape or in braille for students who are blind. (3) An applicant that proposes to carry out a model science program for secondary students and is concerned that girls may be less likely than boys to enroll in the course, might indicate how it intends to conduct \"outreach\" efforts to girls, to encourage their enrollment. (4) An applicant that proposes a project to increase school safety might describe the special efforts it will take to address concerns of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students, and efforts to reach out to and involve the families of LGBT students . We recognize that many applicants may already be implementing effective steps to ensure equity of access and participation in their grant programs, and we appreciate your cooperation in responding to the requirements of this provision. In accordance with Section 427 of the Department of Education's General Provision Act (GEPA), the Maine Department of Education and all particip ating School Administrative Units (SAUs) plan to review existing policies and procedures to ensure that every aspect of the American Rescue Plan ( ARP) Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds application and reopening plans fully aligns with the requirements of Section 427 . This review of the Maine Department of Education and the SAU policies will occur prior to the beginning of any approved projects. Upon completion of the review s steps will be taken , as needed , to revise , modify, or develop new policies and procedures for complete alignment and compliance with Section 427 to ensure equal access and participation to all persons regardless of their race, color, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender, age, citizenship status, or disability to the programs and services provided by the federally funded ARP ESSER federal emergency grant. The ARP ESSER application is focused on supporting SAUs to safely reopen and sustain the safe operation of schools and address the disproportionate impact of COVID -19 on underrepresented student subgroups, including each major racial and ethnic group, children from low -income families, children with disabilities, English learners, gender, migrant students, students experiencing homelessness, and children and youth in foster care. Professional development , technical assistance and any programming will be offered for all participants and every effort will be made to eliminate unfair barriers to their participating, such as translating written materials from English to Spanish, or Braille. Specialized electronic equipment and other needed accommodations will also be made available for those who request it. The State has a comprehensive Affirmative Action Plan (AAP) committed to creating a workforce that reflects the diversity of qualified in dividuals in the labor market. It is the policy of the state to recruit, hire, train, and promote persons in all job titles, without regard to race, color, sex, national origin, age, 69 religion, marital status, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, or other extraneous consideration not directly and substantively related to merit or performance. Employment decisions and personnel actions, including, but not limited to compensation, benefits, promotion, demotion, layoff/recall, transfer, termination, and training are based on the principle of ensuring equal employment opportunity and affirmative action. 70 Estimated Burden Statement for GEPA Requirements According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.
