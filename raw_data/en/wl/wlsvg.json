In 1796 a German physician, Samuel Hahnemann, discovered this different approach to medicine. He had become frustrated by the dangers of conventional medicine and searched for a form of medicine that would be gentle, and extremely effective. Homeopathy is based on the law of similar (\"like cures like\"). Which means, the disease a medicine can cause, it can also cure. Ok, so what does that mean? Often, as homeopaths, we use the analogy of the onion. Imagine it's a cool, clear Spring day and you are making a fresh salad in your kitchen. You chop the tomatoes and cucumbers, tear the romaine lettuce, then you begin to cut a large red onion. All of a sudden your eyes begin to burn and the tears start to well up, whew! Instinctively you walk outside to get some fresh air and you notice that almost immediately your eyes are no longer burning and the tears stop falling. You have just conducted what homeopaths call a proving. A heavy dose of onion was given to a healthy individual and it produced a certain effect. The symptoms produced by cutting an onion are strikingly similar to what some people experience when they have seasonal allergies. So, for those patients that fit this specific picture a skilled homeopath would prescribe onion, or in a latin, allium cepa to resolve that patient's allergies. Our Homeopathic Doctors "}
