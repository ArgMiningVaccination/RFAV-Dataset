Amanoi - Ninh Thuan, Vietnam Wellness Philosophy Since opening in 2013, Amanoi's spa has reaped multiple awards, and the recent addition of two dedicated spa houses and a wellness programme centred on East Asian medicine therapy only strengthen the offering.Whether one chooses the detoxification, weight management or stress control track, each immersion is goal-oriented, requires a minimum of three full days, and tailored. Each day is made up of movement: from a private yoga class to guided hikes within the property; treatment: a Vietnamese cupping massage, modern-day hammam ritual and more; and specialist sessions: such as guided qigong and meditation classes or meridian therapy; the specific components decided during the arrival consultation. They are complemented with a guilt-free immersion menu, plus twice a day serving of herbal tea, specially brewed to address one's ailments. Highlight Customised wellness retreats are best enjoyed at the two purpose-built spa houses, Thuy Lien and An Son. The former, where I stayed, comes with a hammam, steam room, Jacuzzi, cold plunge pool, ice fountain, relaxation deck and a 15m pool overlooking a serene lotus pond. An Son comes with a banya thermal facility. Tatler Tip Book a reiki treatment with Shyam Goyal, Amanoi's spa manager. Emotional well-being is given as much importance at Aman, and this amazing session will convince\u2014and change\u2014even the most jaded and sceptical among us. (Related: [Meaghan See Embarks On "}
