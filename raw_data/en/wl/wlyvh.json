Phase one entails rapid prototyping - utilizing concepts from user experience research - to refine the content and design of the brief intervention. The second phase entails an RCT enrolling unvaccinated young adults from around the US to fully test the efficacy of the intervention in terms of vaccine uptake, intentions, and attitudes towards vaccination. This project is conducted in collaboration with Drs. Jennifer Duckworth (Washington State University) and Cynthia Stappenbeck (Georgia State University). Project Period: March 1, 2022 \u2014 November 30, 2023 Funding Type(s): Federal CDC & APA Geographic Area(s): National Patient Population(s): Young Adults "}
