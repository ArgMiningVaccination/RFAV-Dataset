They are the messengers that tell your cells what to do. Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy is one way you can continue to support and balance your hormones as you go through life. Your body will undergo numerous changes as you age. Often, these changes are unpredictable and unwanted. This is especially true for women whose hormone levels drop during menopause. These types of hormonal changes can negatively impact your quality of life. [Natural hormone replacement with bioidentical hormones](https://rosewellness.com/hormonal-imbalance-treatment-hrt/) is a great way to restore what has been lost and return to the quality of life you want. Treating hormone imbalances holistically involves many factors. The first step involves understanding the [cause of your imbalance](https://rosewellness.com/what-causes-hormonal-imbalance/). Some causes may be health conditions or treatment-related while others may be a body's natural reaction to aging, stress, or other underlying factors. Once you understand the root cause of your hormone imbalance you can address it with a natural hormone replacement strategy. What is Holistic Hormone Replacement Therapy? Holistic hormone replacement therapy utilizes bioidentical hormones to mimic those produced by the human body. Bioidentical hormones are artificial hormones that are processed from plant estrogens that are chemically identical to what the human body produces. Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) is used to treat men and women when their hormone levels drop or become unbalanced. It is most often used for symptoms of perimenopause and [menopause in women](https://rosewellness.com/when-does-menopause-start/). You see, hormones are chemicals made by your endocrine glands. They tell other parts of your body how and when to function. Even the slightest imbalance can cause symptoms that disrupt your daily life. Holistic hormone replacement therapy is used as a treatment for these symptoms. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are the most commonly used bioidentical hormones. Synthetic Hormone Replacement vs. Natural Hormone Replacement Therapy Bioidentical hormones such as estradiol, estriol, and progesterone have the same molecular structure as the hormones made by your body. Meanwhile, synthetic hormones used in hormone replacement therapy do not have the same molecular structure as the hormones in your body. Instead, your body has to work to break them down into a usable form. This may come as a surprise to you but both [bioidentical hormones](https://rosewellness.com/symptoms-of-hormone-imbalance-for-women/) and synthetic hormones are made in a laboratory. Although bioidentical hormones are considered more \"natural\" because they are derived from plants rather than man-made chemical compounds. Bioidentical hormones can be produced by a pharmaceutical company or a compounding pharmacy. While more research is needed, [initial studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19179815/) found that patients report greater satisfaction with HRTs that contain progesterone compared with those that contain synthetic progestin. Bioidentical hormones have some distinctly different, potentially opposite, physiological effects compared with their synthetic counterparts, which have different chemical structures. Ultimately, the research found that through physiological data and clinical outcomes bioidentical hormones are associated with lower risks, including the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease, and are more effective than their synthetic and animal-derived counterparts. Who Should Not Use Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy? You may be wondering if you are a good candidate for [BHRT](https://rosewellness.com/best-bioidentical-hormone-doctor-near-me/).
