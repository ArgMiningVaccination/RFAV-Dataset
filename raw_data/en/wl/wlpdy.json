Despite its age-old roots, Ayurvedic wisdom is still highly relevant and perhaps even more beneficial than ever before when it comes to finding balance and optimal health in modern life. Ayurveda typically works with the individual, and many of the lifestyle practices are determined on what dosha or body type you are, according to the Ayurvedic principles. However, there are also a number of simple ways that you can embrace the practices of Ayurveda, and one of the most common ways is to try some commonplace Ayurvedic recipes. One of the best things about Ayurveda is that many of the recipes are quite simple. While they may have a long ingredients list, many of these are simply herbs and spices that you most likely have on hand. Ayurveda recipes focus on getting back to basics, back to the healing powers of nature, and creating nourishing dishes that are full of 'agni' or digestive fire meaning they are easy to digest and assimilate. Modern-day life can be a toxic environment, and even if we are mindful about eating well, exercising and finding ways to reduce stress, toxins still build up within our bodies. Ayurveda helps us to function at our optimal level of health by addressing all areas of our lifestyle and incorporating things like proper nourishment, self-care rituals, hygienic practices, beneficial physical activity and healing herbs to help us to feel balanced, enlivened and clear. Dahl is the cornerstone to any Ayurvedic diet or cleanse. It is simple to make at home and is very satisfying, yet light and easy to digest. It is suitable for all Ayurveda types and all seasons, making it the perfect recipe to have on hand. If you would like to dive deeper into the overall health benefits of Ayurveda, try this nourishing dahl recipe below.
