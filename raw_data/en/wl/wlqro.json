Therefore, it is important to understand individuals' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. The present study applied the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explain the intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated among a representative sample in Qazvin, Iran. The TPB uses psychological constructs of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control to explain an individual's intention to perform a behavior. Fear and perceived infectability were additionally incorporated into the TPB to explain the intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. Utilizing multistage stratified cluster sampling, 10,843 participants (4092 males; 37.7%) with a mean age of 35.54 years (SD = 12.00) completed a survey. The survey assessed TPB constructs (including attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention related to COVID-19 vaccination) together with fear of COVID-19 and perceived COVID-19 infectability. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to examine whether fear of COVID-19, perceived infectability, and the TPB constructs explained individuals' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. The SEM demonstrated satisfactory fit (comparative fit index = 0.970; Tucker-Lewis index = 0.962; root mean square error of approximation = 0.040; standardized root mean square residual = 0.050). Moreover, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, attitude, and perceived COVID-19 infectability significantly explained individuals' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. Perceived COVID-19 infectability and TPB constructs were all significant mediators in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. Incorporating fear of COVID-19 and perceived COVID-19 infectability effectively into the TPB explained Iranians' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. Therefore, Iranians who have a strong belief in Muslim religion may improve their intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated via these constructs.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-06-22", "cleaned_text": "Fear of COVID-19 and Perceived COVID-19 Infectability Supplement Theory of Planned Behavior to Explain Iranians' Intention to Get COVID-19 Vaccinated [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070684](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070684) [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00684)], the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00684)]. Apart from psychological and physical health, almost all aspects of human life have been affected, including (but not limited) to financial activities, social interaction, education, and occupation [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00684)]. In order to overcome the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on human lives (over 172 million confirmed cases and over 3.7 million deaths worldwide [ [https://covid19.who.int/](https://covid19.who.int/), accessed on 7 June 2021]; nearly three million confirmed cases and over 80,000 deaths in Iran as of 7 June 2021 [ [https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/ir](https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/ir), accessed on 7 June 2021]). COVID-19 vaccination has been rapidly developed with more than 60 candidates under clinical examination [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00684)]. Moreover, over three million vaccine doses had been administered in Iran as of 23 May 2021 [ [https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/ir](https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/ir), accessed on 7 June 2021]. [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00684)]), issues concerning vaccination uptake have long existed because some individuals distrust vaccination, especially those who believe in some advocacy from online sources and skeptical communities [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00684), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00684)]. Indeed, alleged consequences from the administration of some vaccines such as autism development have been claimed, even though there is no clinical evidence to support such a notion [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00684)]. This distrust may therefore also be applied to COVID-19 vaccination and may subsequently hamper the speed of COVID-19 vaccination uptake worldwide. Vaccine hesitancy has been listed as one of the top ten global health threats, particularly as a consequence of vaccine misinformation in social media. In addition, individuals may not want to have to endure short-term adverse reactions, such as having a high fever and/or sore arms caused by the vaccines [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00684)]. As a result, it is important for healthcare providers and policymakers to understand key factors explaining an individual's intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. More specifically, widespread COVID-19 vaccination alongside herd immunity may reduce the infection rate and mortality of COVID-19. [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00684)]. Among several useful theories explaining vaccination uptake (e.g., protection motivation theory (PMT [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00684)]), a theory using fear and perceived vulnerability to explain human health behaviors; and health belief models (HBM [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00684)]), a theory using health perceptions to explain human health behaviors), the theory of planned behavior (TPB) [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00684)] serves as the present study's main framework to investigate an individual's intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. The TPB proposes that attitude (i.e., how an individual evaluates a behavior), subjective norm (i.e., how an individual perceived others' judgement on a behavior), and perceived behavioral control (i.e., how an individual is confident in performing a behavior) are key psychological constructs to explain why an individual performs a specific behavior [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00684)]. [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00684), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00684)], human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00684)], and more recently COVID-19 vaccination [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00684)]. Moreover, the efficacy of the three main constructs in the TPB (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) is promising in explaining individuals' intention to uptake vaccination [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00684)]. One meta-analysis reported the total explained variance of intention to uptake vaccination to be 54% [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00684)]. Although actual behavior (i.e., actual COVID-19 vaccination uptake) is a much more important outcome measure than the intention (i.e., intention to uptake COVID-19 vaccination), the present study focused on intention rather than actual behavior (i.e., COVID-19 vaccination uptake) for the following reason. At the time when data collection took place, the numbers of COVID-19 vaccination doses available were insufficient to cover the entire Iranian population. Therefore, the shortage of COVID-19 vaccination doses may have biased (i.e., underestimated) actual behavior or COVID-19 vaccination uptake. In this regard, using the TPB to explain individuals' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated is appropriate. [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00684), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00684)]. In summary, the TPB claims that attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control are important constructs that explain the intention of an individual to perform a human behavior [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00684)]. This can be applied to the behavior of COVID-19 vaccination uptake as well as to the intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00684), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00684)]. [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00684)]. Therefore, arguments on whether the TPB should be retained in health-related behaviors have been debated [ [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00684), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00684), [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00684), [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00684)] and the notion of extending the TPB has been generally acceptable among behavioral researchers. Therefore, the present study extended the TPB with the incorporation of another two important factors (fear and perceived vulnerability) proposed by PMT [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00684)]. The PMT claims that perceived vulnerability (e.g., how an individual perceives the possibility of getting infected) is triggered by fear and then results in an intention for protection (e.g., COVID-19 vaccination uptake) [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00684), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00684)]. With the consideration of fear and perceived vulnerability (hereafter, the present study uses perceived infectability because only the infectability construct was assessed as part of the vulnerability in the present study), the extended TPB was therefore examined in the present study. [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00684)]; 398 in Shmueli's study [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00684)]; 374 study [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00684)]; 2529 in Cordina et study [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00684)]; and 788 in Guidry et al.'s study [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00684)]. In this regard, the present authors proposed to use a large-scale study incorporating more than 10,000 individuals to fully examine the effectiveness of the extended TPB. Moreover, the large Muslim majority in Iran (99%) could have an effect on their vaccine behavior. More specifically, from religious texts in Islamic books, all of them emphasize observing health tips to prevent disease and prioritize prevention over treatment. Moreover, there have been some concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines in Islamic religion because vaccination is not supposed to be Halal (i.e., lawful in Islamic law). However, religious leaders have had a large influence on Muslims' willingness to uptake or not uptake vaccination. Therefore, the willingness of vaccination uptake among Iranian Muslims may be different from people with other religious beliefs. As a result, it is important to examine whether the extended TPB can work on such a specific population. [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00684-f001)). The specific hypotheses were that (i) fear of COVID-19 would positively explain perceived behavioral control over COVID-19 vaccination uptake, (ii) fear of COVID-19 would positively explain the subjective norm of COVID-19 vaccination uptake, (iii) fear of COVID-19 would positively explain attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination uptake, (iv) fear of COVID-19 would positively explain perceived COVID-19 infectability, (v) perceived COVID-19 infectability would positively explain attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination uptake, (vi) perceived behavioral control over COVID-19 vaccination uptake would positively explain the intention of COVID-19 vaccination uptake, (vii) the subjective norm of COVID-19 vaccination uptake would positively explain the intention of COVID-19 vaccination uptake, (viii) attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination uptake would positively explain the intention of COVID-19 vaccination uptake, and (ix) perceived COVID-19 infectability would positively explain the intention of COVID-19 vaccination uptake. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants and Recruitment Procedure 2.2. Measures 2.2.1. Fear of COVID-19 [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00684), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00684), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00684)]. In the present sample, the internal consistency ( = 0.88), composite reliability (CR = 0.87), and average variance extracted (AVE = 0.48) were acceptable. 2.2.2. Perceived COVID-19 Infectability 2.2.3. Perceived Behavioral Control over COVID-19 Vaccination 2.2.4. Subjective Norm of COVID-19 Vaccination 2.2.5. Attitude toward COVID-19 Vaccination 2.2.6. Intention to Get COVID-19 Vaccinated 2.3. Data Analysis [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00684-f001)for the illustrated proposed model). In order to have a better understanding regarding the additional explained variance in perceived COVID-19 infectability and fear of COVID-19, nested models were evaluated. Following this, invariance using multigroup SEM was tested for the final supported model across gender, living area, and age. Bias-corrected bootstrap test with 10,000 bootstrapping samples was used to examine whether the mediated effects exist. Furthermore, the following fit indices were used to examine whether the collected data fitted well with the proposed model: comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.95, Tucker-Lewis index approximation (RMSEA) < 0.06, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) < 0.08 [ [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00684)]. The SEM was done using the IBM AMOS 24.0 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL). 3. Results [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00684-t001). In brief, the mean age of the participants was 35.54 years (SD = 12.00); slightly over one-third of the participants were males (n = 4092; 37.7%); nearly three-quarters of the participants were currently married (n = 8092; 74.6%); slightly over three-quarters of the participants resided in a city area (n = 8186; 75.5%); and the top three educational levels were having a university degree (n = 4230; 39.0%), having a diploma degree (n = 2761; 25.5%), and completing secondary high school education (n = 1540; 14.2%). Moreover, all the participants in the present study were Muslim. [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00684-t002)reports the bivariate correlations between the fear of COVID-19, perceived infectability, and TPB constructs. All the bivariate correlations were significant (p < 0.01) with the magnitudes ranging between 0.172 and 0.765. Moreover, [Table 3](#vaccines-09-00684-t003)reports the mean (SD) scores of the fear of COVID-19, perceived infectability, and TPB constructs (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention). [Table 3](#vaccines-09-00684-t003)further reports the item properties for all the tested constructs (i.e., fear of COVID-19, perceived infectability, and TPB constructs). All the items had moderate to strong factor loadings. More specifically, factor loadings (i.e., how an item was associated with a latent construct) for attitude construct were between 0.794 and 0.909; for subjective norm were 0.881 and 0.898; for perceived behavioral control were 0.720 and 0.837; for intention were 0.907 and 0.927; for perceived COVID-19 infectability were between 0.384 and 0.703; for fear of COVID-19 were between 0.631 and 0.765. [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00684-f002)). When scrutinizing the proposed final model that incorporates fear of COVID-19 and perceived COVID-19 infectability with the TPB, it had a good fit for all the fit indices but a significant 2 test (2 = 5496.57; p < 0.001). The satisfactory fit indices of the final model were CFI = 0.970, Moreover, path coefficients were all significant ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00684-f002)c), indicating that perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, attitude, and perceived COVID-19 infectability significantly explained an individual's intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00684-f002)). The final model showed that the path coefficients were invariant across age, gender, and living place ( [Table 4](#vaccines-09-00684-t004)). Mediation analyses further indicated that perceived COVID-19 infectability and TPB constructs were all significant mediators in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated (standardized coefficient = 0.302; coefficient = 0.369; SE = bootstrap = 0.278, 0.327; p < 0.001). 4. Discussion [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00684)] although one Iranian study reported that 65.7% Iranians from 370 online respondents were willing to pay for COVID-19 vaccination in November 2020 [ [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00684)]. In this regard, understanding the psychological factors that explain the intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated among Iranians is important for authorities and healthcare providers to boost the uptake rate. Consequently, the infection rate of COVID-19 can be effectively controlled. [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00684), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00684), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00684)] and the present study's findings extend the effectiveness of TPB to the intention of COVID-19 vaccination uptake. That is, the present study found that attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control in the TPB were all significant factors explaining intention of COVID-19 vaccination uptake. This finding corresponds well with what prior TPB studies on vaccination uptake have found [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00684), [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00684), [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00684), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00684), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00684)]. For example, Guidry et al. found that American adults who were more positive toward COVID-19 vaccination and had higher levels of subjective norms held greater intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00684)]. Zhang et al. reported that mainland Chinese factor workers who had greater perceived behavioral control possessed a higher level of intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated [ [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00684)]. Shmueli recently incorporated the TPB with the HBM to explain the intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated among Israeli adults and found the incorporation of TPB and HBM was effective [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00684)]. [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00684), [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00684)] supplements the usefulness of the TPB. Therefore, healthcare providers may use fear and perceived COVID-19 infectability (e.g., distributing the true information that COVID-19 infection has 2% of mortality rate and the prevalence of COVID-19 confirmed cases is high) to improve an individual's intention to uptake COVID-19 vaccination. The present study found that perceived COVID-19 infectability was a significant factor in explaining individuals' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. However, the findings contradict those of Wang et al. [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00684)]. More specifically, they found that perceived vulnerability (i.e., a construct similar to the present study's perceived infectability) was not associated with individuals' intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. A potential explanation is the difference in studied populations between the two studies. Wang et al. tested the association between perceived COVID-19 vulnerability and intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated among mainland Chinese university students and the present study tested this association among the Iranian general population [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00684)]. Because the infection severities of COVID-19 are different in the two countries (i.e., Iran has a more serious COVID-19 situation than mainland China), it is possible that the participants in Wang et al.'s study had low levels of perceived vulnerability which subsequently contributed to the nonsignificant association with intention to get vaccinated [ [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00684)]. [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00684), [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00684), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00684)]. Moreover, the present findings provide evidence showing a potential mechanism as to why the fear of COVID-19 is associated with intention to get COVID-19 vaccinated. More specifically, fear of COVID-19 may trigger individual's psychological factors of perceived behavioral control over COVID-19 vaccination uptake, subjective norm of COVID-19 vaccination uptake, attitude to COVID-19 vaccination uptake, and perceived COVID-19 infectability. These psychological factors in turn are likely to contribute to individuals' intentions to get COVID-19 vaccinated. This psychological mechanism also works in the Iranian population who have a strong belief in Muslim religion. [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00684)]. Therefore, the high level of fear may strengthen the associations between fear of COVID-19 and TPB constructs. However, in order to effectively control COVID-19 infection, efforts from all countries worldwide should be worked out in a coordinated framework. Therefore, the specific findings from the Iranian population are arguably important in controlling the spread of worldwide COVID-19 infection. Following this limitation, given that the present study recruited mostly Muslim individuals, the findings cannot necessarily be generalized to other religious populations (e.g., Christianity and Buddhism). It is possible that religiosity or cultural background may impact on COVID-19 vaccination uptake intention or behavior. Therefore, future studies are encouraged to examine this issue further. Finally, the present study did not assess the actual behavior of COVID-19 vaccination uptake because this information might have been biased due to the shortage of vaccination doses in Iran. Individuals' intention does not indicate their actual behavior in getting COVID-19 vaccinated. Therefore, future studies are encouraged to collect behavior information when the Iranian government has sufficient COVID-19 vaccination doses. 5.
