It's also not a solid, liquid, or gas. Dr. Gerald Pollack, scientist, researcher, and author, explains the Fourth Phase of Water that is in the body. He goes over what it is exactly, how we can build more of it (through certain foods and light exposure) and how it helps us age more slowly and live more healthily.

You may have heard that the human body is 2/3 water but that water is not the same as the water in a drinking glass. It's a different kind of water that's not liquid, solid, or gas. This is Episode 407. Our guest is a researcher, scientist, author, and expert in the fourth phase of water. He helped discover this fourth phase, known also as Exclusion Zone or EZ water. Understanding what helps build this water in the body can help us strengthen our bodies, build resilience, help us feel better, and age more slowly. Our guest is [Dr. Gerald Pollack](http://www.pollacklab.org/). He explains exactly what EZ water is, how we can generate more of it through sunlight, infrared light, exercise, and certain foods, and why it matters.

I'm delighted to be here once again. I will try my best to answer whatever questions you might have. I find your work fascinating. When you and I first spoke years ago, it all went over my head. I had no idea what you were talking about, EZ water and the fourth phase of water, but now having spoken to other experts, I get the idea. I want to make sure all of us, including the audience, get the idea of how this phase of water can benefit our health and how we might be able to even get in contact with it more. First, let's take it bit by bit and help us understand. Is EZ water or this fourth phase of water the same thing as structured water? It is and it isn't. Structured water is a generic term. It means water with some structure but everything has structure. The term is not so useful. I'm not sure where it started. It might have started with Gilbert Ling who spent his life studying what he called structured water and what a lot of people called structured. The idea is that ordinary liquid water in a sense is not structured because it consists of individual molecules that are randomly disposed and bouncing around a furious number of times each second or each femto-second even. You would imagine that a mix like that has no structure to it. On the other hand, what Gilbert Ling and others were talking about is the idea that water molecules are ordered in some way. That's how it all started. Instead of using the term ordered, Gilbert and others use the term structured. Structure does convey, in general, the idea that this water is this. You might call it halfway between water and ice. Ice has a structure to it. It's a crystal. All the molecules are organized in certain ways. This water is not ice. It's water but it's water that is organized or structured. What Gilbert Ling and some others had surmised is that the structure consists of individual molecules that are stacked on one another like soldiers at attention. I spoke at length about that in my 2001 book, [Cells, Gels, and the Engines of Life](https://www.amazon.com/Cells-Gels-Engines-Gerald-Pollack/dp/0962689521), whose theme was, \"We should pay attention to what Gilbert Ling has been talking about because it's important.\" Once we started doing experiments immediately after that book had been published, we found that it was not quite the case. The so-called structured water, which we gave a different name, and I'll get to that in a moment, is different. The liquid water has undergone a transition from individual molecules to sheet-like structures that stack upon one another. The term structured is vague. Initially, we called it EZ or Exclusion Zone. It's easy to remember unless you're in England or some other place where it's zed. EZ is Exclusion Zone. We gave it that name a long time ago because what we noticed is that there was a zone of water that excluded almost everything. It was pure. If you initially had some salutes or particles in the water in this form, they would get kicked out. There was a purity to it. It excluded virtually everything. We called it Exclusion Zone water. It was suggested by an Australian colleague but that's not a great name even though it's easy to remember because it doesn't tell you very much except that this is a kind of water that tends to exclude, and that's all. Later as we kept finding that this Exclusion Zone water had properties so vastly different from ordinary liquid water, it seemed like another phase of water. We began calling it the fourth phase. The fourth phase is accurate. We know that the standard three phases are solid, liquid, and vapor. This is the fourth. What you were alluding to at the end of your question is, \"Is it important for health?\" There's a lot to say about that but for a starter, our bodies are filled with EZ water or fourth-phase water. It's not liquid water. The way you can easily discern that is to cut yourself. Take a razor blade, and if you wish, slice. If the water inside your body were liquid water, it will come pouring out like from a breached water pipe but that's not the case. It doesn't come out. The water is more gel-like. It stays in and sticks to the solids inside your cells, so the water doesn't come pouring out. It's a different kind of water. That's the water that we have been talking about. That's the fourth phase of water, which has gel-like features. It builds next to hydrophilic water-loving surfaces. Your body is filled with all of the solids inside your cells, proteins, nucleic acids, and others. The majority of their surfaces are hydrophilic and water-loving. Therefore, the water that sits next to them will be EZ or fourth-phase water, not liquid water. Your cell is densely packed with those solids that all the water inside your cell is EZ water. That's why it doesn't come pouring out when you slice yourself. Let me ask you because I like to take this heady information, translate it for the readers, and make it accessible and understandable. If I'm hearing you correctly, there is a phase of water that you and your colleagues dub the fourth phase of water or EZ water. That is a different state that is more easily absorbed by our bodies. Our bodies thrive with this kind of water but when we are drinking regular liquid water, it's not as easily absorbed by the cells as this fourth phase of water. That's what I'm trying to figure out. How can I make this water structured so it's better absorbed by cells so I can be living my healthiest and best life? You have to know something about what it is that converts the water that you've been drinking into EZ water. We understand what converts the water. There are several things. First of all, to build any structure or organization, you need energy. That's a given. You can surmise that by thinking about your office. You sit down at a desk that you have and throw down some papers, pencils, and your thumb drive. After a few weeks, it gets awfully messy. It requires no energy for you to make it messy but if you want to get it organized, structured, and ordered, you need to take 30 minutes out and focus on the ordering. That requires energy. That's a simple example of the fact that if you want to go from a random state to an ordered state, you need to put in energy. We struggled with where the energy comes from for doing this. It turned out it was light. It's not any kind of light but it's infrared light. Most people are not so familiar with it. They think you turn on the toaster and push it down. The bread goes down. If you look inside, you see those coils glowing bright orange and say, \"It's warm. It's generating something. That's infrared energy.\" That's correct. However, everything is generating infrared energy, including the screen behind you, yourself, and the hinges on the screen. If you want to go from a random state to an ordered state, you need to put in energy. The way you can demonstrate that is to turn off all the lights. You will see nothing. Your latest iPhone camera will see nothing despite its high sensitivity but if you have a camera with a sensor that is sensitive to infrared energy instead of visible light energy, infrared is a little bit longer in wavelength. If you whip out one of those cameras and turn it on, you get a beautiful image of everything including your necklace, your dress, the screen behind you, and the hinges on the screen. You see it all, which means that everything is generating infrared energy. The energy required for converting ordinary liquid water to EZ water is in the environment. It's also inside your body because your metabolism is generating heat. Heat is not the same as infrared energy but for all intents and purposes, it's the same. You take some water and drink it. There's a tendency for that water to convert to EZ water because as you drink the water, much of the water will be sitting next to one or another of those hydrophilic surfaces but you also need the energy. The energy is available. It's available not only inside your body from the metabolic heat but also outside your body because everything is generating infrared energy. The energy is there, which means EZ water is always present. If you drink ordinary liquid water, a fraction of it will turn into EZ water. The rest of it gets peed out. I see people with special wands. They say, \"I'm structuring my water.\" They put the water outside in the sunlight and say, \"I'm trying to structure my water,\" as if our bodies couldn't do the same thing you were describing. Our bodies can do it but the question is, \"How effective is the body? How much EZ water do you need?\" When you're six months older, we know that the body then contains 85% water. As we get wrinkly with age, we have a smaller percentage of water. Part of the reason is we don't have the capacity to structure the water as effectively as when we're born when everything is right usually. We need some help. We can get help from infrared energy that's inside the body and outside the body. Many people have turned, for example, to infrared lamps. You shine the infrared lamp. What does that do? It builds EZ water. A critical part that I neglected to mention, which is described in my Cells, Gels, and the Engines of Life book is everything the cell does, whatever kind of cell, whether it's a muscle cell and it contracts, if it's a secretory cell and it secretes, or if it's a nerve cell and it conducts. Always the action of the cell involves a transition from EZ water to ordinary water and then back again. That transition is central. This is not part of standard physiology understanding or anything like that but the evidence is clear. Anybody who might be interested could read the book and make their judgment but the main point is that you need it for you to function properly. You look as though you function pretty properly. I feel like I do. You look like you do. What you need is a full complement of EZ water inside your cells. You want to make sure that you've got enough of it. Kids usually have plenty of it but as we become wrinkly with age, then we have less of it. We need all the help we can get. The second half of your question is, \"Can we create EZ water? What about these wands?\" There are dozens or even more than dozens of ways various companies are advertising that they sell various things that create structured water, EZ water, fourth-phase water, or whatever they call it. Probably some of them do. It would be nice if these companies provide evidence that they do. Many of them say, \"We can structure the water,\" but we don't generally see the evidence for it. It's not trivial to do this. I'm not suggesting that there are ways for anybody to go into their kitchen and make structured water. Maybe they can. Maybe they can't. It needs to be explored but there are several ways at least theoretically to do it. One is to have plenty of solid surfaces that build EZ water. One of those, for example, is chia seed. Chia seed is amazing in its capacity to do that. You throw a few seeds in, add some water, and get this gel-like substance that's filled with EZ water. That's one way to do it but then you have to separate the chia seed from the water. Who knows what happens when you attempt to do that? That's one way. Another way is to put an electrical charge in the water. We found that if you stick an electrode in the water, you need to stick two electrodes in the past current. Right next to that negative electrode, EZ water builds. The water is converted from neutral ordinary water to negatively charged EZ water. EZ water typically is negatively charged. You need to put electrons in the water, and the water will transition. That's another way that you can build it. It's not so convenient depending on what you have available. Another way is to expose the water to sunlight. Fifty percent roughly of the energy of the sun is in the infrared region. That's why the sun feels warm. It's not just light that is conferred by the sun but also heat. We feel the heat. If you put water out in the sun, the sunlight at least in theory ought to build EZ water. For example, in India, it was common. I'm not sure how common it is now to take some jugs of water, color them, and put them out in the sun. If someone's ill, you choose the appropriate one. That appropriate one will be good for your health. When the Ayurvedic people came to that understanding, I'm not sure if they understood what they were doing but what's going on is that EZ water is getting built. EZ water is good for health. When you're ill, you drink one of those jugs of water, and you should get better in theory. I wanted to ask you about data that backs up the statement you made that EZ water is good for health. Tell us a little bit about that. I'll tell you in the form of a story. Maybe that's the best place to start. The story is as is well-known for 5,000 years. I don't know the height of the Ayurvedic culture. You know better than I do. It's some thousands of years. The people in that culture were interested as we are in optimum health. They must be. What did they do? Typically, they would take certain herbs, for example, turmeric. Apparently, it helped with all kinds of afflictions. You take turmeric and get better. We started thinking, \"How does this work at least in terms of what we know about modern physiology and health?\" One idea that we didn't like a whole lot but it's possible that the body has receptors all over the place for turmeric. In your heart, you have turmeric receptors. If you take turmeric, the receptors say, \"Turmeric is great.\" We get better. The same is true with your big toe. You've got pain in the big toe. There's a turmeric receptor there. You take turmeric, and the pain in your toes disappears. That's one idea. Another idea is that turmeric has one single effect, and that effect impacts everything in your body. That's a more attractive hypothesis because it's simpler. Based on the principle of Occam's razor, you've got two options to explain something. The simpler one is going to be the one that is probably correct. We were hypothesizing, \"Maybe turmeric builds order and EZ water. If it builds EZ water, that EZ water is all over our body.\" If we ingest turmeric, eventually it spreads throughout our body, or at least the water that it comes into contact with is spreading all around the body. The hypothesis was maybe small amounts of turmeric build EZ water. We tested it, got a positive result, and published it. It's not only turmeric but other agents known to be beneficial for health for thousands of years, not in conventional medicine terms but known in these ancient cultures. For example, we tested basil. The so-called holy basil is the same thing. We also tested poison to see if it did the opposite. We used glyphosate or weed killer. In theory, it doesn't kill us but it kills the weeds. One wonders about the distinction. Small amounts of turmeric build EZ water. There's a lot from Stephanie Seneff and others about glyphosate and its harmful impacts. We added a small amount of glyphosate to the water that formed EZ water. Sure enough, at every concentration we looked at, it diminished the amount of EZ water. We don't know if the poison glyphosate acts the way other poisons act but a simple mechanism of action of poisons that remains to be tested is that they deplete EZ water. Without EZ water, the cells can't function. Without cell function, you die or at least get sick. We also tried ghee or clarified butter. That had a tremendous impact. There's a tremendous growth of EZ water more than practically anything. The point is we have tried a multiplicity of agents that are known to be positive for health. They all build EZ water. It doesn't prove that it's EZ water that is responsible for health but it certainly is consistent with that hypothesis. \u2014 Coming up, Gerald gets specific about the food and healthy habits that build more EZ in the body. \u2014 Go to [Second Spring Foods](https://www.secondspringfoods.com/) to find your favorite sprouted pantry staples and use the code WISE for 10% off.

There are. The first way is to follow what I was expressing. Take turmeric and basil. Use ghee when you're preparing foods and such. It's been known for thousands of years that those agents are good for health. That's certainly one way. Another way is to go out in the sun because the sun contains infrared energy. That infrared energy builds EZ water. That will be another way. Another way to achieve much the same is to go into a sauna. It's heat. Whether it's moist heat or dry heat, I wouldn't say it's irrelevant but it's heat. Heat is full of infrared energy. Take your clothes off, go into the sauna, and expose yourself for 20 or 30 minutes. I've had the experience. I come out feeling better than when I went in. Most people feel that. Why is that? There are various theories and such. The reason is it is infrared energy. Infrared energy is building EZ water throughout your body. Without a full complement of EZ water, you're not functioning properly. If you've got muscle aches, for example, and your muscle is cramped or such, you go in and expose yourself and your muscles to the infrared energy that builds EZ water and returns the muscle to its natural state because the natural state is full of EZ water. If your muscle is cramped, it surely doesn't have enough EZ water, at least transiently. You have to build up that EZ water, which leads to the muscle relaxation back into the high potential energy state ready to contract again. One bit of advice you gave years ago when you were on the show was to get near natural bodies of water, waterfalls, or the beach. Does that exposure to that water somehow help also build the EZ water in our bodies? If you're near a waterfall, there are lots of little droplets that come off the waterfall. The studies are published in a book called [The Fourth Phase of Water](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Phase-Water-Beyond-Liquid/dp/0962689548), which has been out for some time. It's popular. I'm flattered by its popularity. It's high on the Amazon review list. I'm not sure why. Much of what I want to say or have said is described in that book. We described in that book droplets. What does a droplet consist of? We found through experimentation one thing about droplets. They're always close to being spherical. When you think about a spherical droplet, why is that? Our studies show that the droplet contains a membrane of EZ water. It's like onion layers. There are many layers on the periphery. That's the outer shell of a droplet. Inside the droplet are positive charges, which are repelling one another and pushing out against the membrane of the EZ. The droplet contains EZ. It turns out that there are more EZ than there are positive charges. There are more negative charges than there are positive charges. We have evidence for that. You're going near the waterfall. You breathe in those little droplets. What you're doing is you're getting a negative charge. You're getting EZ water principally. Getting EZ water means good for your health. I hope that answers that particular question. As we start to close up, I have a couple of personal questions for you. Have your findings changed how you relate to water in general? In other words, do you seek out waterfalls? Do you speak to your water as Emoto has done? Veda Austin has done some studies on this too. Do you relate to water differently now? I would like to answer yes. There is a reverence that I've developed for water but in terms of my personal habits, it hasn't changed a whole lot. I'm hesitant to admit this but I know I should be drinking a lot more water to remain hydrated but I go for coffee every time. Maybe I do get some hydration from coffee, fresh fruits, and such but I don't drink enough water, and I know I need to. I have heard health experts saying, \"Stop drinking water. You're not getting hydrated by the water you drink. You need some other elements to come with it for it to be absorbed into the cells.\" I'm curious about your take on that. If we drink, for example, distilled water, it's got none of the minerals that we need. Some people tout distilled water as being the water you should drink. Other people say, \"Stay away from that water because it's not good for your health.\" I have a tendency to revert to two things natural back 5,000 years ago. What did the people drink? Spring water has a tendency to fill that bill. You can imagine people going to springs, finding the right spring, and drinking it. It turns out that not all but many of the spring waters contain a large fraction of EZ water. There's an easy way of testing to see if you've got EZ water or how much EZ water you have. It involves shining light on the water. EZ water absorbs certain wavelengths of light. They happen to be in the ultraviolet range which is 270 nanometers. If you have a sample of water and shine a light, and it absorbs a lot at 270 nanometers, you've got a lot of EZ water. If nothing absorbs at 270 nanometers, you don't have any EZ water. You can test to see how much EZ water is in what you drink. It turns out that the spring waters vary. Some of them don't have too much EZ content and others have a huge amount of EZ content. I'm hopeful that one day, the granting agencies will understand that the word water does exist in the biological language or any language. It deserves to be studied. Water is considered in the mainstream as nothing more than a background carrier of the more important molecules of life. Everything that we have done in the past couple of decades argues squarely against that concept. Water is not merely a background carrier. It's essential for everything that the body does. The failure to recognize that is one of the reasons why biology or biochemistry seems as complicated as it is. If you start with the wrong foundation, everything appears to be complicated. You build one complication upon another. It becomes practically impossible to deal with. Water is not merely a background carrier. It's essential for everything that the body does. I'm sorry if it doesn't sound very humble but the evidence for me is without a doubt the direction that water is so central to everything that we do and unrecognized in principle. To figure out which water is the best for you or which water is the best under varied circumstances if you've got this illness or that illness, studies need to be carried out. The granting agency has never heard the word water in relation to biology. It's almost hopeless because someone has to be incented to carry out the studies. There's maybe not much money, reward, or demand from the public to understand it better but I liked your advice about going more natural. The wise traditions way is going to what our ancestors were served by and how they thrived. You're exactly right about the spring water with its trace minerals and its happy structure. It's important. The more water you drink, the more EZ is in the water. It should that the logic is better for health. That's one reason why yet another expedient is what some people do, and I bet you do it yourself. You go into your backyard, pull the green leaves from the plants, crush them into a juice, and drink it. My late wife used to do that. Maybe that's what helped her retain some modicum of health despite the gray hair and the loss of hair. It got to be tiresome after a while but what you're doing is you're squeezing the water out of the plant cells. Those plant cells are freshly grown, vital, and healthy. They're full of EZ water. We were able to confirm that. What you're doing by crushing those leaves and squeezing out the juices is you're drinking the water from inside the plant cells. You're drinking EZ water. That water should be good for your health because if you drink EZ water, your body doesn't need to convert ordinary water into EZ water. It comes directly. The plants have gotten the light from the sun. It's gotten all the right conditions to create the EZ water within itself. There isn't much funding for research in this area. What do you say to the skeptic who turns his nose up at this whole water thing anyway? \"You're overrating that. I prefer my Gatorade.\" What do you say to a person who's simply not paying attention to the water inside their body or this special phase of water? There are some things I could say that is not appropriate. It has been my experience that there are some people who are in that category that you mentioned but far more people are interested in delving more deeply into EZ water. It's common in science that we reject any paradigm that comes up that's new and that challenges the existing paradigm. We don't feel comfortable because it upsets our sense of equilibrium. Scientists especially feel comfortable being in a situation where they're in command. They understand there are certain scientific principles. Those principles are foundational. If somebody challenges them, we feel uncomfortable because we have learned a set of paradigms. It's built on foundations. We feel uneasy. If you look back at science and some of the major scientific discoveries, you will find that it happens uniformly when someone comes up with something that shakes the foundation. People who have walked on that foundation and felt comfortable feel most uneasy even Einstein. In 1905, he had three findings that shook the Earth but the idea of relativity was at first rejected by the scientific community. They thought, \"This is nonsense. I don't understand it. This is crazy speaking.\" This was 1905. It wasn't until 1921 or 1922 when he won a Nobel Prize not for relativity but for one of the other discoveries that people began to take him seriously, \"This guy won a Nobel Prize. Therefore, he must be a smart guy. Therefore, whatever he says is right.\" Relativity took hold but this is an example that the scientific establishment has a lot of inertia to it. It doesn't like to move. Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi is considered to be the Father of Modern Biochemistry. He's a Hungarian guy. He's full of wisdom and memorable aphorisms. He's a creative guy. He won a Nobel Prize for discovering vitamin C. He also was into water structures. This was years ago. He's a hero to many people although his reputation tends to fade over time. One of the things he said was relevant, \"When I came forth with a fresh idea, the only time I knew it was significant was when the reactions were polarized.\" \"Some people thought, 'This is absolute nonsense.' Other people thought, 'This is genius.' I knew I was onto something because there always had to be people who objected to it. If it was potentially important, they would object. If it's not so important or it was bland, then it wasn't so important.\" I'm mentioning all of this about Einstein, Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi, Galileo, and the guy who talked about continental drift. They thought he was nuts. Continents drift until they found evidence that it was incontrovertible. New findings are always challenged by the people whom they impact. Someone who has been doing computer models of water and trying to figure out the behavior of 200 molecules every femto-second or less in what they're doing with these models based on a lot of assumptions is not happy. If what we found is correct, then what they're doing doesn't have a whole lot of meaning. People are human. If someone challenged you, you have a belief system that you've developed over the eighteen years of your life. You wouldn't be happy about that. You might object. On the flip side of it, at least for fourth-phase water, the number of applications that are now underway is phenomenal. There's so much interest in it. I spend half my day responding to emails centered around the idea of EZ water because there's so much that stems from it. If you ask me, I would say to a person like someone you mentioned, \"Look at the evidence and draw your judgment.\" Even in my department, I have people who refuse to believe it, \"It can't be right. It must be nonsense,\" without seriously looking at the evidence and challenging me by saying, \"On page 36 of your book, you say, X, Y, and Z but the evidence for that is lacking. What's the evidence?\" If I can't answer the question, then they have the perfect right to say, \"I'm not so sure about this.\" There's a lot of reflexive reaction to it saying, \"The fourth phase of water is nonsense. Everybody knows there are three phases. A fourth phase is crazy-making.\" I hope we have skeptics reading who perhaps are going to give a deeper dive into this subject, check out some of the books you've mentioned and the resources, and come to their conclusions. If the evidence bears out, then they will find the help of the EZ water. Maybe it will change their worldview. If it doesn't, then so be it. I want to ask you the question now that I pose at the end of the show. If the reader could do one thing to improve their health that could be related to this fourth phase of water or not, what would you recommend that they do? I hesitate because I'm not sure which one is best. I mentioned several experiences along the way like going to a waterfall and such, walking on the beach barefoot, and juicing from the vegetables in your backyard but at the center of it all is to make sure you're well-hydrated. Drink enough water or enough vegetables that contain water. You will be well off if you do that. If you have the capacity to drink water that contains a sizable fraction of EZ water, that will be even better. At the core, stay hydrated because hydration is not just a matter of filling the cell with stuff. It's a matter of feeling the cell with the most important ingredient, and that is water or EZ water. That's perfect. Thank you so much for this conversation. I am so happy to talk to you. I hope we do it again before more years go by. Maybe I'll see you at the Wise Traditions Conference next time around. Thank you so much. I appreciate your great questions. We will see you again. Take care. That sounds great. Thank you, Jerry.

For a recent review from [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wise-traditions/id1072618042), Nomdska had this to say, \"Following the Weston A. Price Foundation advice, in 2011, I had some puzzling dental problems. I knew of but had not got around to reading [Nutrition and Physical Degeneration](https://www.amazon.com/Nutrition-Physical-Degeneration-Weston-Price/dp/0916764206) by Weston Price, so I finally did.\" \"I applied the suggestions in the book. Within one week, my dental sensitivity disappeared. I don't even bother going every six months to the dentist anymore after the dentist repeatedly told me I don't have any tartar on my teeth at all. I also have not been sick since 2011. I owe my health to applying what I learned from the Weston A. Price Foundation. Thank you, Sally, for your work and courage.\" Thank you so much for your review.
