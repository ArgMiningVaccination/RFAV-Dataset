Plenty of websites will sell detox capsules, teas and powders. Supporting your body's detoxification can be helpful, but it does have some potential downsides. What is detoxing? Your body has a few main organs that are in charge of processing waste and helping remove it from your body. These organs include your liver, kidneys, lungs, skin and colon. These organs do their jobs every day to help keep you healthy as normal metabolic reactions create potentially toxic waste products. Unfortunately, we tend to also encounter many toxins in our environment through air pollution, water pollution, personal care products, and poor farming practices. This additional burden can make it more challenging for our bodies to function optimally. Climate change has also increased our exposure to toxins due to increased wild fires, etc. Which products are often used to support detoxing? Multiple products are marketed as detox-promoting, some without any evidence or regulation. The FDA does not regulate supplements, so if your supplement isn't third-party tested, there is no way to know it contains the ingredients it claims to contain. Some products are simply laxatives which will increase stool volume, making the consumer feel like they are getting rid of more toxins. Other products will contain herbs that can support liver function (and actually do have some good research behind them). Some common liver supporting herbs and supplements include Milk Thistle, NAC and Artichoke leaf. What are the risks of detoxing? One of the major risks of taking a supplement to aid detoxing is that it can change how fast your body processes medications. For people taking oral birth control to prevent pregnancy, it can be hugely problematic if the amount of birth control in their blood is suddenly much lower. This can also be an issue for people taking medications to manage their mental health as sudden dips in medication levels can lead to mood dysregulation. These are just some examples, but it applies to almost everyone who is taking a pharmaceutical. This is why it is critical to discuss any supplements with your health care provider. Other risks are releasing large amounts of toxins without having a way for them to leave the body. If you are constipated, it is important to address constipation first so those toxins have a place to go. Who absolutely should not attempt to detox? People who are very ill may worsen their health further by trying to \"detox.\" Some examples are people who have cancer, severe liver, kidney or heart disease. It can be safe for these people to detox, but it should be medically supervised. Additionally, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, now is not the time to try to eliminate extra toxins as this may negatively affect your baby. A better approach to detoxing Supporting your body's detoxification every day is less extreme than a 1-2 week fast a few times a year. The more extreme approaches promote a black and white approach that either you are taking care of your body or you are not and this is not helpful in the long-term. You can enjoy some indulgences every day while taking care of your body. They are not mutually exclusive! Tips for everyday detox - Drink enough water. Although the internet likes to promote drinking a gallon of water per day, this is not necessary for most people. A good starting place is drinking half of your bodyweight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, drinking 100 ounces of water is a good place to start. From there, listening to your thirst cues and checking the color of urine (it should be straw-yellow unless you are taking a medication/supplement that changes its color) is the best way to optimize your water intake. Other liquids count as well as long as they do not have caffeine or alcohol. Drinking enough water supports your kidneys in their detoxification process and keeps your skin well-hydrated. - Move your body. Sweating is a great way our body eliminates toxins through our skin. Additionally, when you are breathing faster and/or more deeply, you will eliminate more toxins through your lungs. You do not need to overexercise to achieve these benefits, but breaking a sweat at least a couple times per week is helpful. Spending a few minutes in a sauna is another great option to get sweaty (provided being in heated areas is safe for your current health status). - Consider how much alcohol you are consuming. Guidelines vary for safe alcohol consumption, but any amount of alcohol does need to be processed by your liver. When the liver is processing alcohol, it has less energy available to complete its other important tasks. Some tasty alcohol-free and low alcohol options are carbonated water, tea, coconut water, kombucha and water kefir. - Try dry skin brushing. Using a bristled brush, brush in short strokes towards your heart. This can help remove dead skin cells and potentially help move lymph fluid back towards the heart to improve overall circulation. An easy way to fit this into your routine is to brush while you are waiting for the shower to heat up and then hop in the shower to wash off the dead skin cells. - Apply castor oil to your belly. Topical castor oil helps support the liver's natural detoxification. I like to keep a bottle of castor oil in my shower, apply a small amount to my belly at the end of my shower and then head to bed. Castor oil can stain, so be sure to wear a shirt that you do not mind staining. Also, castor oil is not safe to be used internally. - Eat plenty of fiber. Eating fiber helps feed your gut bacteria and helps keep you regular. Chia seeds are an easy, high-fiber choice. Mix 2 tablespoons of chia seeds with 4 ounces of liquid (I use coconut milk), wait 10 minutes and mix again. Store in the fridge until you are ready to consume your pudding. Chia pudding is excellent topped with fruit, nut butter, cocoa nibs or any other topping that appeals to you! You can also add some stevia to the pudding if you find it is not sweet enough. - Eat the rainbow. Eating all the colors of the rainbow will help support your health overall. Every vegetable has its own benefit, so variety is key. Choosing organic when you can will also help reduce your toxin exposure, but eating conventional produce has more benefits than risks.
