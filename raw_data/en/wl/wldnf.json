In this edition, we take a look at two stories that have been in the news quite a bit this summer: West Nile virus and chronic wasting disease. Both of these devastating diseases are taking a toll on human and animal populations in Colorado and across the country, but at the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, researchers already are hard at work learning more about the basic biology of these diseases, creating new diagnostic tools, and developing potential vaccines. In this edition, we also look at the growing elds of genomics, proteomics, and transgenics. The College continues to make major investments in new technology, increase support for our researchers, and facilitate the growing investigative programs that are at the cutting edge of each of these areas of study. We also wish to send an invitation, along with this edition, to the dedication cer- emonies for the new wing at the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital and the Gail Holmes Equine Orthopaedic Research Center. You'll nd more information inside about both of these exciting developments. We hope you enjoy all the articles in this issue of Insight and we welcome your questions and comments.

We also invite you to visit us at our Web site at www.cvmbs.colostate.edu . 3Message from the Dean Dr. Lance PerrymanDear Friends, I have been dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences for a little over a year now, and in that time, I simply cannot believe the changes that have taken place. I know that the College always has been a dynamic place staffed with visionary thinkers who embrace a \"can-do\" atti-tude, but I still am amazed at all that has been accomplished during the past 12 months. Three major capital construction projects were started last year and, in November, we will celebrate the comple-tion of two of these with dedication ceremonies. The new wing at the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital and the Gail Holmes Equine Orthopaedic Research Center are nearly nished and ready for occupancy. The new wing will house several programs, including the Robert H. and Mary G. Flint Animal Cancer Center, the Argus Institute for Families and Veterinary Medicine, and the Shipley Natural Healing Center. You all are invited to attend the ceremonies and join us in the celebration. We also completed the new stallion barn at the Foothills Research Campus this year, and work continues on the addition to the Microbiology Building, which will house research laboratories and the expanded Macromolecular Resources laboratory. While all of these con- struction projects will enable the College to better meet the research and teaching demands of today and tomor-row, much more is yet to be done. To address that, we have begun the master site plan-ning process for the College's south campus, including the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. We have had our rst round of meetings with our architects, laid out our program goals, and will begin to see what we need to build to meet the future needs of the College. Although this process is very time-consuming - lots of meetings - it's also exciting to chart the future course of the College and visualize where we will be 25 years from now. All of this growth and development does have a common denominator, and that is our faculty's commitment to helping society. We can see that dem-onstrated in this magazine, where we showcase work being done on chronic wasting disease and West Nile virus. We can see it in our focus on genomics and pro-teomics as we further these sciences to help us comprehend human and animal systems and develop the foundation of understanding that will one day lead to cures and treatments for the many diseases that affl ict both. The expansion of the Animal Cancer Center will further enhance cancer research for both animals and their human owners. The new equine facility Of course, much of this important work would not be possible without the generous support of our friends and the hard work of our faculty, staff, and students. So many of you have given generously, and we appreciate the investment you are making in the College.will promote research that may one day help treat and prevent orthopaedic diseases in not only horses, but transfer that knowledge to help people suffering from devastating medical conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis. We also see our faculty's commitment to advancing society in the selection of the Colorado State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory by the United States Depart-ment of Agriculture as a core facility for the detection and surveillance of foreign animal diseases, important to protecting the food supply of our nation. Of course, much of this important work would not be possible without the generous support of our friends and the hard work of our faculty, staff, and students. So many of you have given generously, and we appreciate the invest-ment you are making in the College. We expect the dividends will be plentiful. Thank you. With Best Wishes, Lance E. Perryman, D.V.M., Ph.D. Dean 4West Nile virus was rst detected in North America in 1999 in New York. In 2000, after overwintering with host mos-quitoes, the virus migrated south along the eastern seaboard, while in 2001, it began its march westward. This summer, outbreaks of the virus were reported in Texas, Nebraska, and other mid-western states. By mid-August, the virus made its presence known in Colorado with a large outbreak in horses in Weld County. By early October, 310 horses from 21 Colorado counties had con rmed cases of the virus and 42 horses had died. In addition, ve cases of the disease in humans had been reported. \"We've been monitoring the steady westward progression of the virus, so the news that the virus has reached Colorado isn't surprising,\" said Dr. Lance Perry-man, Dean of the College. \"I think what is a bit surprising is how quickly the virus reached the western United States and that a disease that once was consid-ered exotic now is rmly established in the Western Hemisphere.\" As with other arboviruses, West Nile virus is spread through a bird-mosquito-bird cycle and transmitted to mammals, including humans, through the bite of an infected mosquito. Until recently, according to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, there had been no documented cases of person-to-person, animal-to-person, or animal-to-animal transmission of WNV. But in September, West Nile Virus Continues March Across the Country physicians and researchers were inves-tigating the transmission of a number of West Nile cases in people who possibly were infected through blood transfusions and/or tissue transplants from infected donors. Many questions remain about the virus, but the following information highlights some of what we do know. A Primer on West Nile Virus (WNV) What is West Nile virus? West Nile virus is a mosquito- borne viral disease previously seen only in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and southern Europe. The virus can cause encephalitis, an infl ammation of the brain, or meningitis, an infl ammation of the membrane surface of the brain and spinal cord in humans, horses, cats, dogs, and domestic and wild birds. It is closely related to St. Louis encephalitis, commonly found in the United States for years. Where did WNV originate? WNV rst was isolated in an adult woman in the West Nile District of Uganda in 1937. The virus became recognized as a cause of severe human meningoen-cephalitis in elderly patients during an outbreak in Israel in 1957. Equine dis-ease was rst noted in the early 1960s in Egypt and France, in 1996 in Morocco, in 1998 in Italy, and appeared in 1999 in North America. Although it is not clear where the North American virus origi- nated, the strain appears to be most closely related genetically to those found in the Middle East. It also is closely related to the St. Louis encephalitis virus commonly found in the United States. In 2000, 21 human cases of the virus were reported in the United States with two deaths. In 2002, as of mid-September, 2,000 people had been infected with the West Nile virus, and 98 people had died.How is WNV spread? WNV normally is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. A mosquito will become infected by feeding on a bird that is carrying the virus. The virus recently has been found in the more aggressive Asian tiger mosquito, which is found mostly in the southern United States. Do all mosquitoes carry West Nile virus? No. Mosquitoes are a major insect pest problem in Colorado, but not all types of mosquitoes carry the virus. The principal transmitter of the virus is the Culex pipiens , or the northern house mosquito. Once the mosquito is infected, it can transmit the virus to people or other animals. Can you get WNV directly from birds? Currently, there is no evidence WNV can be spread directly from birds to people. However, to be safe, never handle a dead bird with bare hands. Use gloves to place dead birds in a plastic bag and then place the bag in an outdoor trash bin. If you want to report a dead crow, raven, or magpie, potential car-riers of WNV, contact your local animal control agency or the Colorado Depart-ment of Public Health and Environment at (303) 692-2700 or visit the Web site at www.cdpe.state.co.us for instructions on how to submit a dead bird for test-ing. What are the signs of WNV infections in people? People with mild infections either have no signs or display signs of a mild illness such as headache, body ache, swollen lymph glands, a mild rash, and fever before fully recovering. Those with more severe infections may experience high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, and paralysis. Who is most at risk? Although anyone can get the virus, people over 50 years of age and those with compromised immune systems are in the highest risk group. As with other arboviruses, West Nile virus is spread through a bird-mosquito-bird cycle and transmitted to mammals, including humans, through the bite of an infected mosquito.5What is the treatment? There is no speci c treatment for West Nile viral infection. In more severe cases, hospitalization is recommended with intensive supportive therapy: intra-venous fl uids, airway management, and ventilator support if required. This also will help to prevent secondary infections, such as pneumonia. If bitten by an infected mosquito, how long until symptoms appear? Being bitten by an infected mos- quito will not necessarily make an individual sick. If illness were to occur, it would begin to appear within three to 15 days of being bitten. How is WNV diagnosed? To diagnose a WNV infection, doctors must test either blood or cere-brospinal fl uid from a spinal tap for antibodies to the virus. A second blood test is required two to three weeks later to con rm the diagnosis. Is there a vaccine? Currently, there is no vaccine for humans. In a recent congressional hearing, federal scientists reported a human vaccine could be available in three years. West Nile Virus in Pets Can dogs and cats become infected with WNV? Yes. Dogs and cats can become infected the same way humans become infected - by the bite of infectious mos-quitoes. It is possible that eating dead, infected animals such as birds, could infect dogs and cats, but this has not been proven. Can infected dogs or cats transmit the virus to humans or to other animals? No. There is no documented evi- dence that WNV can be transmitted by animal-to-animal or animal-to-human contact.Should a dog or cat infected with WNV be euthanized? There is no reason to destroy an animal because it has been infected with WNV. Full recovery is expected. Treat-ment should be supportive and consis-tent with standard veterinary practices for animals with a viral infection. West Nile Virus in Horses How do horses become infected with WNV? Horses become infected the same way people do - by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The virus is located in the mosquito's salivary glands, and when the mosquito \"feeds\" on the horse, the virus is injected into its blood system. In the bloodstream, the virus multiplies and may cause illness. What are the signs of WNV in horses? Not all horses become clinically ill. In those that do, following transmission by an infected mosquito, the virus multi-plies in the horse's blood system, crosses the blood/brain barrier, and infects the brain. The virus interferes with normal central nervous system functioning and causes infl ammation of the brain. Clini-cal signs include loss of appetite and depression, fever, weakness or paralysis of hind limbs, muscle fasiculations or muzzle twitching, impaired vision, lack of coordination (ataxia), head pressing, convulsions, dif culty in swallowing, cir-cling, hyperexcitability, or coma. Do these symptoms always indicate WNV? No. Some other mosquito-borne viral encephalitic diseases of horses caused by Eastern, Western, and Ven-ezuelan encephalitis viruses can cause a horse to demonstrate signs similar to WNV. Additionally, diseases such as rabies, botulism, and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) also have signs similar to WNV. If you think your horse is exhibiting signs of encephalitis, contact your veterinarian. Only laboratory tests can con rm a diagnosis of West Nile encephalitis.Can an infected horse transmit WNV to horses in neighboring stalls? No. There is no documented evi- dence that WNV is transmitted from horse-to-horse. However, precautions should be taken by removing the horse from further potential mosquito-borne infection and testing for the virus. What is the treatment for an infected horse? There is no speci c treatment for West Nile virus in horses. Most horses recover from the infection. Treatment would be supportive and consistent with standard veterinary practices for animals infected with a viral agent. Caregivers should prevent the animal from injur-ing itself. Is there an equine vaccine protecting against WNV? Yes. A WNV vaccine for horses has been conditionally approved and is avail-able through veterinarians. The vaccine consists of two intramuscular doses administered three to four weeks apart, followed by an annual booster. Vaccina-tion against Eastern equine encepha-litis, Western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis will not protect against WNV.

Both species, pulled back from the brink of extinction with aggressive breeding, habitat protection, and re-introduction programs, now face a new threat - the West Nile virus. In 1987, the last wild California condor was taken into captivity. Hunting, poisoning, accidents with power poles, and habitat destruction were leading the birds down the path of extinction. With only 21 of these magni cent birds left on the planet, an unprecedented recovery program was put in place to save the species. By 1998, the population had grown to 150 birds, with 35 of those released to the wild. In the 1940s, there were between 14 and 16 whooping cranes left in the world. Habitat destruction was the main culprit, with the marshy wetlands needed for whooping crane breeding grounds being drained and turned into farmland. Laws were enacted to protect breeding grounds, and in 1967 a recovery program began to revitalize the species. By 2001, there were 320 whooping cranes and the birds seemed to be thriving. But the West Nile virus threatens to take these successes away. To date, neither species has tested positive to exposure to the West Nile virus, but sci-entists aren't sure what to expect if they do. In some species of birds, such as the American crow, raven, and magpie, infection is always fatal. In other species, such as chickens (often used as West Nile \"sentinels\") and starlings, expo- sure causes no illness. Researchers are not sure how the virus will affect whooping cranes and California condors, or how populations of exotic and rare birds in national zoos and sanctuaries will fare. So the push is on to nd an avian vaccine. \"There are two focuses to our work here,\" said Dr. Bowen, who is a Professor in the College's Department of Biomedical Sciences. \"First, we are evaluating the pathogenesis of West Nile virus in animals including horses, cats, dogs, and pigs as well as birds. We are trying to understand why some animals get sick and others don't and why the virus is able to replicate to such high levels in hosts like the American crow, but not in other species of birds. For example, in crows, viral infection rates are at one billion infectious doses per milliliter of blood, while in horses that number is only 1,000. We aren't sure why that is, but it is de nitely why the crow is what's called an ampli ed host. Mosquitoes can become infected and spread the disease after feeding on an infected crow, but because of the lower numbers of infectious doses in a horse, spread of infection after feeding on an infected horse is unlikely.\"Dr. Bowen said that in addition to studying the pathogenesis of West Nile virus, his laboratory is evaluating vac-cines. The researchers are looking at vaccines for horses, cats, and crows, though the avian vaccine is proving to be tough. \"We work closely with the Center for Disease Control in this work,\" said Dr. Bowen. \"Shortly after West Nile virus was rst reported in 1999, the CDC went to work on a vaccine for horses and continues to develop others. We help determine if the vaccine is reasonable, then the rights to that vaccine typically are sold to a private company that in turn works with us to conduct further evaluations of the vaccine.\" Although a vaccine for horses already is available, additional studies are being conducted on new equine vaccines. Also important, said Dr. Bowen, is the fact that information gleaned from studies on animal WNV vaccines is applicable to human medi-cine and one day may help with the development of a vaccine for people against WNV. \"Although people are at a very low risk for contracting West Nile encephalitis, now that the virus is here to stay we want to be working proactively to protect not only animals at risk, but people, too,\" said Dr. Bowen. \"What we learn here should provide some insights into the pathogenesis of West Nile virus, as well as effective vaccination routes.\" Funding for the research work underway in Dr. Bowen's laboratory is provided by the CDC, the Of ce of the Dean, the horse industry, and private biotechnology companies. \"We are trying to understand why some animals get sick and others don't and why the virus is able to replicate to such high levels in hosts like the American crow, but not in other species of birds.\" 7Equine Researcher Ramps Up Colorado Studies on West Nile Virus It was the year 2000 when Dr. Josie Traub-Dargatz had the opportunity to work with a group of researchers at the Centers for Epidemiology and Animal Health on a virus that was relatively new to the United States - the West Nile virus (WNV). Dr. Traub-Dargatz, a Professor in the Department of Clinical Sciences, had a feeling that this new threat to horse health was here to stay, and she wanted to be involved with the research this exotic infectious disease would require. The result of that early work was a case-control study that examined environmental and management factors associated with equine exposure to West Nile virus. The study, published in 2001, was a sign of things to come. In 2002, WNV made its way to Colorado, and Dr. Traub-Dargatz and her research associates now had the virus on their doorstep. One of the rst things undertaken by the Department of Clinical Sciences to combat WNV was horse-owner education and a vaccination clinic to help protect horses. The clinic was organized by the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital ambulatory faculty, including Drs. Racquel Rodeheaver and Joe Stricklin, students, and support staff, with the cooperation of many equine veterinarians in Larimer County. New research projects also were kicked off to help veterinarians and scientists develop a better understanding of the virus, risk factors for exposure, remediation of risk factors, and the development of a data-base to track the virus in individuals and populations. \"West Nile is so new to our state that we are still in the process of developing research ideas,\" said Dr. Traub-Dargatz. \"But one thing we already are working on and have approval for is blood testing. We are hoping to collect blood samples from up to 300 horses to determine the number that have been exposed to West Nile virus, determine the percent that go on to develop the disease, and determine the antibody response in horses that receive the WNV vaccine and in those that have recovered from the disease. We are starting out with the very basic ideas regarding what we want to study. We have a lot of work ahead of us. The Animal Population Health Institute here at Colorado State is providing nancial support to assist us in this preliminary work with WNV.\" Research conducted so far, as reported in the August 2001 West Nile Virus in Equids in the Northeastern United States in 2000 , does provide some answers to the many questions surrounding WNV. An important dis-covery was that WNV appears to be geographically clustered around areas with large mosquito and communal bird populations. The study also recom-mended ecological assessment of areas where WNV is found to determine spe-cies of mosquitoes and infection status of free-ranging birds. While studies are getting underway, Dr. Traub-Dargatz recommends that owners not wait but go ahead and get their horses vaccinated. \"If a horse gets two vaccina- tions this year and one early next year, they more likely will be pro-tected than if owners wait until next spring to start the vaccina-tion series,\" Dr. Traub-Dargatz said. \"I am advising owners to go ahead and protect their horses. The vaccine was approved because of evidence it creates an immune response to WNV, and it is one of several ways owners can protect their horses against an infection that will kill 20 to 30 percent of horses that develop clinical signs of disease.\" One study that Dr. Traub- Dargatz is proposing is follow-up tests of serum to determine the antibody response in vaccinated horses, as well as following up with horse owners who had animals that became ill from WNV. \"Right now, we hope to learn from this follow-up to see what has happened to the horses that develop disease from WNV infection,\" said Dr. Traub-Dargatz. \"We want to get a better idea of what is happening in the horse population when it is challenged with WNV. This not only will help us in planning future studies, but also will help us plan for next spring when WNV is back.\" A complete copy of West Nile Virus in Equids in the Northeastern United States in 2000 is available at www. nahms.aphis.usda.gov . One of the rst things undertaken by the Department of Clinical Sciences to combat WNV was horse- owner education and a vaccination clinic to help protect horses.

On November 1, the Gail Holmes Equine Orthopaedic Research Center will celebrate its grand opening with a dedication ceremony at 2 p.m., fol-lowed by an open house until 4 p.m. Gail Holmes will be a guest speaker at the ceremony. On November 6, the new wing of the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital will be dedicated with an open house tour of the Animal Cancer Center, Argus Institute, and new exam rooms from 1-3 p.m. and ceremony at 3:30 p.m. General Norman Schwarzkopf will be a special guest at the dedication of the new wing. Friends, supporters, faculty, staff, students, and clients are invited to attend the festivities. \"We want to use the dedications not only as an opportunity to celebrate the completion of these ne facilities, but also to thank the many people who made them possible,\" said Dr. Lance Perryman, Dean of the College. \"Without the support of our friends and donors, faculty, staff, and students, none of this would have been possible. But people had a commitment to our vision of excel-lence and helped to make that vision a reality.\" James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital Addition For the past three years, the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences has been engaged in a private and public campaign to raise $11 mil-lion for the much-needed addition to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The cam-paign enlisted the efforts of well-known personalities such as General Schwarz-kopf, Hollywood's Bart the Bear, Gover-nor Bill Owens, and New York artist Wil-Dedications Set for New Hospital Facilities liam Wegman, all of whom volunteered their time or talents for public service ads. The addition is now a reality. The new 35,000-square-foot, two- story addition is the showplace for the Robert H. and Mary G. Flint Animal Cancer Center, the Argus Institute for Families and Veterinary Medicine, and the Shipley Natural Healing Center. The new addition contains examination rooms, state-of-the-art research labora-tories, a special multipurpose training and lecture room, tumor tissue process-ing and archiving, and magnetic reso-nance imaging and nuclear medicine capabilities. The second fl oor houses of ce and administrative space. The Vet-erinary Teaching Hospital also received a face lift with a new exterior front fa\u00e7ade of brick and stucco, a remodeled entrance, and an expanded, remodeled client waiting room.Within its new facilities, the Animal Cancer Center will continue to conduct innovative cancer research and provide state-of-the-art treatment for compan-ion animals. The Shipley Natural Heal-ing Center will focus on the scienti c evaluation of a broad range of natural medicines and therapies. Support of the human-animal bond in teaching, client services, and outreach is the role of the Argus Institute for Families and Vet-erinary Medicine. The new facilities will enable the Argus Institute to expand its services including veterinary education, client support, continuing education, and a new program in animal behavior. Some key facts about the new wing: 34,700 square feet on two fl oors 12 new, fully equipped exam rooms Observation rooms for training and teaching.

A generous gift of $600,000 from Herbert Allen and Gail Holmes brought total donations to the $1.1 mil-lion necessary to build the new surgical and animal care facility, located north of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Other major donors included Coolmore Stud, the Thoroughbred Corporation, and Mark Dedomenico, who also is co-chair of the Orthopaedic Research Advisory Board. A gift of $250,000 from Barbara Cox Anthony allowed for the continuation of renovations on the space allocated to orthopaedic research in the Dairy Science building, also north of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The new facility features surgical suites, a visitor's center, of ce space, and two wings of deluxe stalls for up to 32 resident horses, along with an outdoor run and a separate com- mons paddock for exercise space. The new space enables team members to regularly schedule surgical procedures rather than sharing surgery space with the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, where surgical room time is at a premium. Major areas of research in the Equine Orthopaedic Research Program are articular cartilage healing, role of microdamage to the subchondral bone in traumatic joint disease, development of synovial fl uid and serum markers to detect early damage to articular cartilage and subchondral bone in joint disease, intravenous hyaluronic acid and its mechanism of action, gene therapy, and studies on the effect of conformation and racetrack surface. \"The completion of these two facilities moves us to a different plane of research,\" said Dr. David Frisbie, Assistant Professor with the Department of Clinical Sciences and Manager of the Equine Orthopaedic Research Labora- tory. \"We will be able to get larger cor-porate accounts and be competitive for larger grants in arthritis research. We'll also be able to consolidate and modern-ize our research facilities, enabling us to work more ef ciently and with greater quality.\" The remodeled laboratory includes space for the large Materials Testing Machine, currently underused because of space limitations, and the Biomedical Engineering Program; hard tissue histol-ogy and molecular biology laboratories; graduate student of ce space and com-mons room; and a darkroom, freezer, and walk-in cooler, all essential to the program's operations.

He spent years meticulously crossbreeding tall and short plants and plotting traits passed on from the parent plants to the offspring. Mendel developed numerous theories and introduced something he called the \"gene,\" which he de ned as the basic unit of heredity. Mendel could not have imagined the complexity of the system he had only just begun to discover. Fast-forward 150 years, and we have moved from the simple pea plant to the human genome project - a decade-long undertaking to map and sequence the 40,000 genes of the human genetic code (although this number still is controver-sial). Scientists around the world now are studying the nature of life in more highly de ned ways. At Colorado State University, joint research efforts between the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, the College of Agriculture, and the College of Natural Sciences are incorporating genomics, proteomics, and transgenics as scienti c tools to advance cutting-edge research into everything from basic cell function to the workings of infectious diseases. \"To resolve a complex disease problem, we have to de ne the disease problem and then nd a solution,\" said Dr. Lance Perryman, Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedi-cal Sciences. \"We have to discover the basis of disease at the molecular level, then resolve it by applying what we learn to medical practices in the hospital, clinic, and eld. For the last 10 years, we have focused on the genetic level using genomics and transgenics, both still powerful tools. But we now are expand-ing to look at proteomics - the proteins encoded by genes - and how changes in levels of proteins or changes in the pro-teins themselves infl uence animal health and disease.\" Genomics Genomics is an approach that allows researchers to examine changes in the expression of the entire genome of an organism in response to a speci c stimulus, mutation, or disease process. This analysis generally is based upon gene chip assays. The entire genome of most organisms can be analyzed using only a few chips. Dr. Laurie Stargell, an Associate Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, is one researcher who uses genomics and gene chip assays heavily in her research work in yeast. \"The basic principles of gene expression are conserved as we move from yeast to humans,\" said Dr. Stargell. \"So we can learn a lot about genes by working with a simple model like yeast. In addition, the technology and tech-niques we develop working with a sim-pler system will apply to humans, though on a huge scale.\" In her laboratory, Dr. Stargell is working to understand transcriptional regulation of gene expression in yeast, which have only 6,500 genes compared to the 40,000 in humans. Her research team can make mutations and look at the effect of those mutations on gene expression pro les. They can change or delete genes and use the gene chip assays to see how gene expression has been changed. Her work is in collabora-tion with Pharmacia and Upjohn for its anti-fungal potential and is funded by the Gregor Mendel, the \"Father of Genetics.\" Dr. Laurie Stargell 11continued on page 12National Institutes of Health and by the March of Dimes for its application to the prevention of birth defects. \"Genomics is such a powerful tool that it has a wide band of infl uence across academia, industry, medicine, and basic science,\" Dr. Stargell said. \"Working with yeast, we are looking at how genes are regulated, what are the underlying concepts, the proteins syn-thesized, signaling, and more.\" Genomics, which is the analysis of DNA and RNA, has been used as a research tool at Colorado State for a number of years. In 1990, Macromolec-ular Resources was developed as a core facility at the University to provide DNA sequencing, synthesis of oligonucle-otides and peptides, mass spectroscopy analysis, and other services. Gene chip assays are a newer tool used in a number of laboratories, including Dr. Stargell's. Dr. Dennis Knudson of the Agricultural Genomics of Pathogens, Pests and Plants program is collaborating with Drs. John Belisle and Richard Slayden of the Department of Microbiology, Immunol-ogy, and Pathology to print Mycobacte- rium tuberculosis microarray slides on campus.Proteomics Decoding the human genome has led to the next big step in science: devel-oping an understanding of the proteome - the proteins that genes help make. Though proteomics has been around for quite some time, it is only recently with the completion of several genome mapping projects - including the mouse genome, human genome, and, earlier, the yeast genome - that proteomics is ready to come to the forefront. \"We are just beginning to look at proteins on a proteomic scale in our laboratory,\" said Dr. Stargell. \"But pro-teins are the real players. The genes determine what proteins are made, but it is the proteins that do the actual work in the cell.\" Researchers in the Mycobacteria Research Laboratories are using pro-teomics tools to compare the proteins of M. tuberculosis cells to identify fac- tors that lead to virulence and to target antigens. In the Department of Chemical and Bioresource Engineering and the Center for Environmental Toxicology and Technology, proteomics is being used to better understand the breakdown of hazardous waste and how toxins affect cellular processes. \"Many people grasp gene structure, but fewer appreci-ate the role protein expression plays in disease and health,\" said Dr. Perryman. \"We think that pro-teomics, where we study the structure and function of proteins, is the next frontier of scienti c discovery.\" Proteomics does have much promise, not only as a research tool, but also as a possible source of treatment breakthroughs for many different diseases, including cystic brosis. In the human lung, one protein's function is to move salt in and out of the lung cells. Working with other proteins, it regulates salt levels. In cystic brosis, this same protein is incorrectly folded. Because it has the wrong shape, it is either ignored or destroyed by other proteins so it can't do its job. Salt builds up in the lung cells, producing a thick mucus than can become infected and eventually kill the patient. Researchers one day may be able to create proteins to x the incorrectly folded protein, using proteomics to de ne form and under-stand function. Transgenics The Transgenic Core Center at Colorado State University has been involved with the development of trans-genic animals for the last ve years. The Center, located in the College's Animal Reproduction and Biotechnol-ogy Laboratory on the Foothills Research Campus, provides an important service that has become an indispensable part of modern biological research. The idea behind transgenic animals is simple, though the techniques are dif cult. A researcher provides clones of the gene he or she is interested in, then the Center staff puts the gene in the appropriate vector and incorporates it into a mouse genome. Once the gene is established, a portion of the offspring of the genetically engineered mouse popu-lation will express that gene. Research-ers can then study and better understand the effects of speci c genes. In addition to gene introduction, normal genes can be removed (a knock-out), and then the animal is evaluated for functions associ-ated with the knock-out gene. One dramatic example of research being done with transgenic mice is a study of the role of leptin in the body. Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells. It is essential to the healthy func- At Colorado State University, joint research efforts between the Colleges of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Agriculture, and Natural Sciences are incorporating genomics, proteomics, and transgenics as scienti c tools to advance cutting-edge research into everything from basic cell function to the workings of infectious diseases.12tioning of the reproductive system and to maintaining proper body fat levels. Researchers have shown that mice with insuf cient leptin levels become very large. Leptin's normal function in the human body is being looked at as one reason for weight gain in late middle-age as people become resistant to the effects of leptin, similar to diabetics becoming resistant to the effects of insulin. \"By using mice as models for humans, we have a better understanding of disease and how genetics can affect health,\" said Dr. Terry Nett, Associate Dean for Research at CVMBS and a Professor in the Department of Biomedi-cal Sciences. \"Transgenic mice provide an excellent tool for studying speci c genes, helping researchers to clarify the role of those genes and the part they play in health and disease.\" Transgenics has applications in Above: Mendel used this early microscope to help teach science to students.Left: Dr. Stargell and Lei Zhang using some of the tools of modern science. many other areas of disease research, including that of Alzheimer's disease. \"Transgenic mice have been cre- ated with genetic alterations in speci c proteins that result in the formation of amyloid plaques,\" said Dr. Nett. \"These substances are thought to cause pro-gressive loss of abstract thinking and memory in Alzheimer's patients. These mice are proving to be invaluable for answering critical questions about the molecular basis of a disorder that affects about 4 million people in the United States alone.\" A University Center for Genomics, Proteomics, and Transgenics A recent grant from the University's Of ce of the Vice President for Research provided a major boost to efforts already underway at the College to enhance its programs in genomics, proteomics, and transgenics. The joint proposal, developed by Dr. Nett and Dr. Norm Curthoys, a Professor in, and Chair of, the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, addresses the need to invest in state-of-the-art equipment, enhance graduate and undergraduate education and research opportunities in these elds, increase faculty and techni-cal staff with expertise in this area, and position the University as a leader in these advanced sciences. The Colleges of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Natural Sci-ences, and Agriculture committed their own resources - dollars and people - to this project, while the University provided a $1.3 million grant. \"During the last 10 years, faculty have been purchasing equipment, get-ting funding for proposals, and build-ing these programs at the individual level,\" said Dr. Perryman. \"With the money from the University's Academic Enrichment Program, we now have a substantial investment to bring us to the next level.\" Dr. Perryman said the majority of the funding would go to purchase the new instrumentation needed for advanced studies in genomics, pro-teomics, and transgenics, including high through-put DNA sequencing, low-scale oligonucleotide synthesis, gene chip analysis, 2-D Gel System, systems for data analysis, additional equipment for microinjection of DNA, and more. Investment also will be made in bringing on board new faculty and staff, training, and facility expansion. The tools, the technology, and the people involved in the studies of genom-ics, proteomics, and transgenics have come a long way since Gregor Mendel and his simple pea plants, but the con-cepts are the same - to discover new knowledge, to shape that knowledge into application, and improve the lot of humankind by putting that application into action. continued from page 11enomics, Proteomics, Transgenics: The New Worlds of ScienceG 13Rapid Test Enhances Monitoring Efforts of Chronic Wasting Disease A rapid test initially used to screen cattle in Europe for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is now in use to screen deer and elk in Colorado for chronic wasting disease (CWD). The test, released for limited use during the deer hunting season, is part of a pilot surveillance system of CWD in Colorado being implemented through a coopera-tive program of the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW), the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Colo-rado State University and its Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories, the Colorado Department of Agriculture, and the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA). Chronic wasting disease, rst described as a wasting syndrome in Col-orado in 1967, is a transmissible spon-giform encephalopathy (TSE) of deer and elk. CWD is believed to be caused by prions - abnormal forms of a normal protein - that infect the host animal by converting normal proteins to the abnor-mal form. The prions, most frequently found in the central nervous system, cause damage to brain tissue resulting in a spongelike appearance. Most cases of CWD occur in adult animals. Transmis-sion pathways for this progressive and fatal disease are unknown. \"A de nitive diagnosis of CWD requires laboratory testing of tissue,\" said Dr. Mo Salman, Director of the Animal Population Health Institute at Colorado State and a Professor in the Departments of Clinical Sciences, and Environmental and Radiological Health Sciences. \"Diagnostic laboratories have been using a technique called immuno-histochemistry (IHC) to test brain tissue for the presence of prions to diagnose CWD. This type of testing, while the gold standard, requires specially equipped laboratories and highly skilled patholo-gists. The rapid test gives results more quickly, can be done by trained techni-cians, and offers bene ts that will allow for wider screening with positives being Ford. Results are reported to the CDOW through their team of data managers. The surveillance system will run through February 2003. After that, Dr. Salman said the research group will provide a report to the USDA with rec-ommendations on what system will work best for monitoring CWD. Monitoring CWD is only part of the equation, however. Research work con-tinues on CWD to determine the ecology and pathogenesis of the disease. Work in Dr. Ed Hoover's laboratory also is looking at developing a live test for the disease as well as a vaccine. \"We currently are working to deter- mine if the CWD agent is carried in deer saliva or urine, as well as working on a rapid screen test that will test speci cally for CWD,\" said Dr. Hoover, a Professor in the Department of Microbiology, Immu-nology, and Pathology. \"At the same time, we are working on a vaccine approach as well. We have had success in develop-ing other vaccines, including a vaccine for feline leukemia virus, and want to put that expertise to work on CWD.\" State and federal interest in CWD is increasing not only because it occurs in elk and deer and appears to be spread-ing geographically, but also because it is a good model for research into TSEs that occur in humans. This includes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which was linked to a BSE outbreak of cattle herds in Great Britain. \"Right now, there are still so many questions about TSEs that we just are beginning to scratch the surface,\" said Dr. Hoover. \"Improved screening and testing, and a greater understanding of the disease's basic pathology, should help to advance our efforts toward a reliable test and an effective vaccine. We hope that with what we learn, we also can help along the science for other TSEs, including those that affl ict humans.\" A mule deer showing symptoms of chronic wasting disease. (Photo courtesy of Dr. Christina Sigurdson, Assistant Professor in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology.) followed up with the immunohistochem- istry testing.\" Dr. Salman said that what research- ers have done is borrow the existing screening test used for BSE in Europe. Using a technique known as ELISA, the test looks for the abnormal proteins by using a speci c reaction that identi- es tissues with prions. The test can be run in four to ve hours, as compared to four days for the IHC. During hunt-ing season, the test is voluntary except in certain areas where the disease is endemic and participation in the screen-ing test is required. A detailed listing of these areas is available at the CDOW's Web site at www.wildlife.state.co.us . For this hunting season, the rst approximately 5,000 samples will be tested by both the rapid test and IHC as part of eld validation. To date, more than 700 samples have been tested with 100 percent agreement between the rapid test and IHC. A crucial and labor intensive part of this testing pro-cess is collecting brain and lymph node samples from hunter-harvested deer and elk. This procedure is performed by the CDOW at collection sites across the state with assistance from 23 veterinarians of the CVMA through its Hunter Assistance Program. The rapid test and the IHC then are performed by Colorado State veterinary diagnostic laboratories in Fort Collins, Grand Junction, and Rocky 14 Researchers Produce First Foal from Oocytes Shipped Across Country Thanks to Colorado State University researchers, Heaven Only Knows is the rst foal born from oocytes harvested from the ovaries of a deceased mare and shipped across the country from Virginia to Colorado for transfer into a surrogate. \"The ability to successfully obtain viable oocytes from transported ovaries means we can offer breeders a lot more options when dealing with the death of a valuable mare,\" said Dr. Ed Squires, a Professor in the Department of Biomedi-cal Sciences and faculty member with the Animal Reproduction and Biotechnology Laboratory (ARBL) at Colorado State. \"We've been able to make amazing strides in reproductive science over the past decade, and this is just one of our successes.\" The process of obtaining and trans- ferring oocytes, which consist of a single cell, from one mare's ovaries to another is a delicate operation in and of itself, without even factoring in the hazards of shipping from Virginia to Colorado. At the time the ovaries were har- vested, the mare, Jaguars Bar Bee Doll, had been dead for several hours. How- ever, the veterinarian, Dr. Vito Del Vento, a Colorado State graduate, recalled that ARBL had been doing extensive research into oocyte transfer, and he made a call. The ovaries were shipped the same day and were delivered to Drs. Lisa MacLellan and Marco Coutinho da Silva at ARBL. Oocyte recovery began immediately by carefully scraping the ovaries, then culturing the six oocytes they were able to retrieve and allowing them to mature overnight in an incuba-tor. The next day, ve of the six were \"The ability to successfully obtain viable oocytes from transported ovaries means we can offer breeders a lot more options when dealing with the death of a valuable mare. We've been able to make amazing strides in reproductive science over the past decade, and this is just one of our successes.\" transferred into a recipient mare from the ARBL herd. Although the conception rate for immature oocytes is only 10 percent to 20 percent, 11 months later Heaven Only Knows was successfully delivered on the Hylton Farm in northern Virginia. Shipping ovaries is not like shipping semen, which is a procedure pioneered at ARBL. As Dr. Squires points out, there are a thousand sperm in a shipment of semen, but there are a limited number of oocytes in a mare's ovaries, and they are much more fragile. Researchers are not even certain of the optimum temperature at which to store the ovaries for ship-ping. In this case, the ovaries were not refrigerated or cryogenically preserved. \"We are still working out the best method for shipping the ovaries, includ- ing developing appropriate containers, method of transportation, and more,\" said Dr. Elaine Carnevale, a lead researcher with ARBL. \"One day, we hope to be able to offer breeders the option of shipping ovaries to us for egg recovery and we hope to be able to mature them and transfer them immediately or freeze them for transfer at a later date.\" Last year, the ARBL team made an important break- through when they successfully delivered twin foals, Vitreous and Ethyl, from oocytes frozen, thawed, and transferred to two dif- ferent recipient mares. 15New Barn Offers Ample Room for Visiting Stallions A new barn located on Colorado State University's Foothills Campus is giving visiting stallions something to kick up their heels about - big stalls, spacious turnouts, and a view of the foothills. The new stallion barn, adjacent to the Equine Reproduction Laboratory, opened in late summer and already is bustling with activity. The new facility is comprised of 1,200 square feet for semen collection, a barn to house 10 stallions for the breeding season, and expanded labora-tory space for the freezing, storage, and export of semen. Construction costs were more than $300,000. Generous gifts from Gail Holmes and Herbert Allen of Double Dove Ranch and Shirley Hoff-man of Hi View Acres, both of Longmont, Colorado, made the building possible. A copper roof, decorative cupolas, and a main corridor lined with rubber pavers are features of the new building, which is specially designed to withstand the added stress that stallions can put on facilities. \"In order to meet USDA and EU requirements, the facility must have appropriate laboratory space and equip-ment, an area for the safe collection of semen, and appropriate facilities for housing stallions,\" said Dr. Ed Squires, a Professor in the Department of Biomedi-cal Sciences and faculty member with the Animal Reproduction and Biotechnology Laboratory (ARBL) at Colorado State. \"We are dedicated to offering our clients the best possible services. In order to do that, it meant expanding our facilities to meet all their needs. We feel we now can offer the best reproductive services avail-able since, with the new approval rating, we also can export semen anywhere in the world.\" From January to July, the Equine Reproduction Laboratory, part of the Animal Reproduction and Biotechnology Laboratory, handles nearly a hundred stallion clients from around the United States. The new facility will allow the staff to increase and extend research that is vitally important to the equine industry. Dr. Pat McCue, an Associate Profes- sor with ARBL, said stallions need more room than mares, so the barn had to be designed with stalls that were big enough and with walls and doors strong enough in which to keep a stallion. The barn was needed because the demand for space had simply outgrown supply. Client horses in the new barn typi- cally are brought to Colorado State for reproduction evaluations, or to stand at stud during breeding season. Currently, the ERL offers client services that include the collection and freezing of semen for international export, semen storage, fertility evaluations, and the breeding of mares using either fresh semen, cooled shipped semen, or frozen semen. As a global business, equine repro- duction typically was an expensive, ardu-ous, and often dangerous enterprise that frequently required live animals to be shipped across the country or across oceans and continents to mate the right bloodlines. Today, thanks to modern science and technology, the process has become safer and easier for owners and participants. Since 1967, researchers at the Animal Reproduction and Biotechnol-ogy Laboratory have made many break-throughs in the eld of equine reproduc-tion including: First foal born from oocytes harvested from a deceased mare and shipped across country Procedures for cooling and shipping embryos Procedures for freezing embryos First foal from sperm injections First foal from oocyte transfer First foal from frozen/thawed oocyte Identical twins from split embryos Three views of the new stallion barn at the Foothills Campus. 16 Tribute Garden a Place of Serenity, Remembrance People working at veterinary teach- ing hospitals and clinics are used to the sights, smells, and sounds that surround them every day. They probably even nd that this environment is comforting because it is part of their routine. For clients and patients, though, a trip to the hospital is anything but routine. The slip-pery linoleum, cold steel accoutrements, animal noises, ringing phones, pagers, and other assaults on the senses often leave visitors stressed. The James L. Voss Veterinary Teach- ing Hospital has had a grassy area with trees and a few benches to provide a wel-come reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the hospital for patients, clients, fac-ulty, staff, and students. Over the years, several memorials had been placed in this area to honor pets and people. With the expansion of the hospi- tal, this area was uprooted. Memorial benches were put in storage and shrubs and plants moved, but most of the old trees remained. When the new wing of the hospital opens this fall, it will feature a new garden - the Tribute Garden. This garden will incorporate the old feelings of comfort and security and feature a Path of Honor that will wind through the garden. This path is the tribute part of the garden. More than 1,300 bricks will display messages of tribute. These message bricks, many already waiting to be placed, come from a wide variety of donors. There are many people memori-alizing their pets, but there also are vet-erinary medical students honoring their parents or a special professor, tributes to doctors who helped save a beloved pet, words of wisdom from famous philoso-phers, and much more. Four-year-old Ethan Linderer wants to be sure everyone will always know that he and his dog Jasmine are \"Best Pals.\" Emily Asay expresses thanks to mom and dad for helping her through veterinary school. Mitzi Sue is honored as a \"gentle helper\" for her years of work as a therapy dog that brought smiles and laughter to patients at the Lutheran Medical Center and the local nursing home. These words of tribute by family, friends, colleagues, and grateful clients are among the hundreds being inscribed on bricks that will become the Path of Honor. The garden also will be home to the fountain and memorial benches from the old garden; special quiet places; a variety of plants, shrubs, and trees; and, in the future, other tributes refl ecting the strength and beauty of the human-animal bond. \"For years, the grounds to the southwest of the hospital have offered a convenient outdoor locale for clients and visitors to spend time with hospital patients or to enjoy a quiet conversation. Over time, it has taken on special mean-ing to the veterinary students, clients, and staff,\" said Dr. Wendell Nelson, Director of the VTH. \"Building the new wing gave us the chance to recreate this unique garden among newly landscaped grass, trees, and foliage.\" Dr. Lance E. Perryman, Dean of the College, said the Tribute Garden and Path of Honor will be dedicated to the alumni, students, clients, patients, and staff who together have created a legacy that honors the spirit and tradition of client and patient care at the James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital. \"What better way to capture the essence of the work being done at the hospital than this special walkway with messages of love, respect, and endear-ment to be shared with the thousands of people who come to the hospital each year,\" said Dr. Perryman. A gift of $100 provides a 4\" x 4\" brick inscribed with up to three lines of copy, and a gift of $250 provides for an 8\" x 8\" brick with up to seven lines of copy. All gifts to the Path of Honor beyond the general construction costs will be used to maintain the garden, create client comfort rooms within the new wing, and enhance services pro-vided by the hospital.

Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Your personal words of tribute will create a permanent legacy that honors the special relationships people share with their pets. Especially designed for pet owners and pets, the Path of Honor provides a peaceful walkway of refl ec-tion surrounded by the fl ower gardens, grassy areas, and secluded alcoves of the Tribute Garden on the grounds of the Hospital. Engraved bricks within the Path of Honor will be read by thousands of people who visit the hospital each year. Your words will forever be a part of the healing atmosphere that celebrates the human-animal bond. Dogs, cats, horses, ferrets, birds, exotics - any and all species may be honored. Many donors inscribe their bricks as memorials to beloved pets. Some make dedications to family members, friends who deeply love animals, or veterinarians who share a special bond with their pet, while others simply inscribe their own name as a declaration of their tribute to the human-animal bond. Throughout the Tribute Garden, there will be a limited number of benches designated to honor a special pet or person. Each bench includes a bronze plaque inscribed with your special message. Bench availability will be on a rst-come, rst-served basis. \"We're so glad we have the opportunity to honor our pets in this meaningful way.

Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital as one of ve core foreign animal disease surveillance and rapid detection labora-tories serving the country. As a core facility, the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory will receive a $2 million grant to purchase new equip-ment, upgrade existing laboratory work stations, and hire additional personnel. Approximately half of the grant will be used to purchase a modular BL3 (biosecurity level three) laboratory for testing of tissues with potentially infec-tious agents. The national network of laboratories is designed to share infor-mation rapidly and con dentially and use a common computer system for data communication. In addition to monitor-ing and information sharing, the core laboratories will be validating genomic and proteomic diagnostic tests devel-oped by the USDA. \"The ve core laboratories are part of the USDA's efforts to build a diagnostic network across the country that is responsible for the surveillance and detection of foreign animal diseases that might be accidentally or purposely introduced to this country,\" said Dr. Lance Perryman, Dean of the College. \"The USDA selected a number of univer-sities for this program, some to focus on animals and some to focus on plants. We were one of the ve labs with an animal focus selected as a core laboratory and, in addition, 12 were selected as satellite laboratories.\" Dr. Perryman said the selection of Colorado State's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory is a refl ection of the superb quality of work at the laboratory, which is under the direction of Dr. Barbara Powers.\"The Veterinary Diagnostic Labora- tory was selected based on several fac-tors including its emphasis on infectious diseases research, geographical location in the country, and the fact that we have a \"digester\" that will destroy infectious agents,\" said Dr. Powers, Director of the Laboratory. \"We are greatly honored to be selected as a core laboratory and look forward to working closely with the USDA to protect our country's agricul-tural animal populations from foreign threats.\" The WR 2 Digester is a specialized alkali digestion system that disposes of animal carcasses while destroying infec-tious agents. It is one of the few systems approved to destroy animal carcasses infected with prion-based diseases such as chronic wasting disease in deer and elk and scrapie in sheep.

The USDA currently is asking the core and satellite laboratories to moni-tor seven foreign animal diseases. These include foot-and-mouth disease, rinder-pest, lumpy skin disease, and contagious bovine pluropneumonia in cattle; classi-cal swine fever and African swine fever in pigs; and exotic Newcastle disease in poultry. Additional diseases may be added as warranted. \"The threat of foreign animal dis- eases has been with us for many years, and the concept of a national network of laboratories has been in the works for some time with the American Associa-tion of Veterinary Diagnosticians,\" said Dr. Powers. \"But with 9/11, efforts to establish a network took on a new sense of urgency as there became greater con-cern about biosecurity and the health of our agricultural animal populations. We are very excited to be a part of these efforts.\" 19Continuing Education Courses Equine Reproductive Equine Spermatozoa Date: Nov. 4, 2002; Nov. Nov. Medicine: Animals Date: Nov. 9-19, 2002 970-491-8509 Dog owners throughout Northern Colorado got special attention for their best friends while making a donation to a worthy cause during the second annual Dog Health Day September 14 at Colorado State University's James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Organized by students in the Profes- sional Veterinary Medical Program, Dog Health Day bene ted the American Veter-inary Medical Foundation's VMAT teams, the emergency veterinary teams who fl y into disaster areas to provide medical support for injured animals and for the search-and-rescue dogs often used in such situations. The event also bene ted the local CSU/Fort Collins Community Pet Hospice Program, which provides end-of-life homecare for pets and emotional support and education for their families. At this year's event more than $5,000 was raised. Veterinary services offered during the day for a suggested donation included physical exams, dental exams, nail trim-ming, dog washing, behavior problem information, and more. Participants also had the chance to take home a variety of products in exchange for a contribution. Services and gift certi cates donated by local businesses were raffl ed during the day. Donations came from Foot of the Rockies, Carmike Cinemas, Richie's Express Carwash, the Texas Roadhouse restaurant, and the Wherehouse. Dr. Cynthia Johnson, a member of VMAT 3, was on hand to demonstrate how a veterinary MASH unit operates in a natural or manmade disaster, discuss the type of physical and mental prepara-tion necessary to qualify for such a team, and explain the special medical and survival gear each team member must be prepared to carry in and out of disaster areas. Other local groups offered dem- onstrations throughout the day includ-ing Mike Manzo of the Longmont Fire Department and his re forensic special-ist dog \"Shadow\" who, by snif ng the site of a re, can help determine its origin; the Fort Collins Police Department's K-9 Unit; and the Rocky Mountain Search and Rescue Team. Dog Health Day was organized last year after the events of September 11 to raise money for the Heroes Fund.

Orme, Director of Mycobacteria Research Laboratories in the Department of Microbi-ology, Immunology, and Pathology, has been elected a fellow in the American Academy of Microbiology. Dr. Orme is one of only 1,700 scientists elected to a fel-lowship in the 47-year history of the organization. Members of the American Academy of Microbiol- ogy (AAM) are elected by their peers through a highly selective, annual evaluation process and admitted to fellowship based on records of leadership and outstanding, original work that has advanced the microbiological sciences. Academy fellows represent 35 countries and all subspecialties of microbiology, including basic and applied research, teaching, public health, industry, and government service. \"We are exceptionally fortunate to have a researcher of Dr. Orme's caliber here at Colorado State,\" said Dr. Perryman, Dean of the College. \"Dr. Orme's research work, particularly in the eld of tuberculosis, is helping to create hope in communities ravaged by diseases caused by Mycobacterium.\" Dr. Orme is particularly known for developing a mouse model for the study of tuberculosis that is now widely used in TB vaccine development and drug screening, and he has made important contributions to understanding the mechanisms at work in immu-nity to tuberculosis. American research on vaccines and anti-TB drugs almost ceased a few decades ago as public health of -cials assumed the disease was on the way to becoming completely eradicated. However, tuberculosis is now the leading bacterial killer in the world, with 10 mil-lion new cases and 3 million deaths each year. It is resurgent in developing countries and, in America, in prison populations, among the homeless, and in HIV/AIDS-infected patients. A factor in its return, and one of particular concern to Dr. Orme, is that some TB strains are resistant to several anti-TB drugs. Most recently, Dr. Orme and his team have worked with broad-spectrum antibiotics in the fl uo-roquinolone class to discover a drug that is effective in ghting latent tuberculosis without creating drug resistance. The researchers hope to combine the drug with other drugs already in use to possibly shorten the course of treatment, reduce the dosages and side effects, and provide a new treatment option at a lower cost.
