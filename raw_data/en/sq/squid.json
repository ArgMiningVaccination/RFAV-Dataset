Although there are a significant number of reports con-cerning the traditional uses of plant species, there is an urgentneed to evaluate plant-derived medications true clinical out-comes, their interactions with prescription medications, andlong-term safety in vitro, in vivo , and in clinical studies [3, 4]. Potentilla alba L. (Rosaceae) has a long tradition of therapeutic use in Europe, especially in the eastern part of the continent. Mainly, the rhizome of this plant have been used alone or as a partof a comprehensive therapy to treat thyroid gland disorders [5, 6].Despite the great potential that has been revealed in several clini-cal studies conducted in Ukraine and the availability of methodsenabling solid dosage form production with the white cinquefoilextract that complies with Russian Pharmacopeia requirements[7], there has been no herbal drug approved by the European Union that contains P. alba . However, a few dietary supplements imported from Eastern Europe containing P. alba rhizome extractare slowly becoming more popular in the European Union sp h a r - macies and online markets. Thus, there is still a need for furtherevaluation and standardization of such supplements. Moreover, further assessment is required to identify the main components responsible for the observed effects. This review therefore aimsto examine and discuss the literature data concerning the biolog-ical and pharmacological aspects of P. alba preparations. Methodology/Methods Search All relevant information concerning the botanical description, tra- ditional use, phytochemical composition, pharmacological activ- ities, and of P. alba was collected from pub- lished literature, with no time restrictions.

Currently, this species is used in Eastern Europe as aremedy to treat dysentery and various thyroid gland dysfunc-tions. The present review summarizes the advances in the phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological research related to this plant species. Clinical trials that have been con-ducted to date support its traditional use for treating thyroiddisorders, although its exact mechanism of action, bioavaila-bility, and pharmacokinetics data are missing.New Perspectives for the Use of Potentilla alba Rhizomes to Treat Thyroid Gland ImpairmentsReviews 19Augustynowicz D et al.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria Relevant articles in all languages were identified and indepen- dently evaluated for their competence and inclusion by two differ- ent authors. After compliance with the inclusion criteria, experi-mental research and clinical trials that assessed the target plantcomposition and/or evaluated its effects were included in this re-search. Improper studies (1), original papers considering onlyother species from the genus Potentilla (2), or articles with a lack of access to the abstract and/or main text (3) were excluded. Botanical Description and Distribution P. alba , also known as white cinquefoil, is one of approximately 500 species of the genus Potentilla belonging to the Rosaceae family. The valid taxonomic name of this species was first de-scribed in 1753 by the Swedish botanist Carl von Linn\u00e9 in his work\"Species Plantarum \"[8]. This Potentilla species is also known under the synonyms of Dasiphora alba (L.) Raf., Fragaria alba (L.) P. alba is distributed in the central parts of Europe and West Asia in temperate and subarctic climatic zones. Thus, this speciesis indigenous to France in the western part of Europe to the cen-tral and southern parts of Russia in the east and from the Balticstates, Poland, and Germany southwards to Italy, Albania, and Romania. This plant has also been introduced to Great Britain [9]. P. alba is widely distributed in a variety of environments, including deciduous forests, where it is a characteristic species for the plantcommunity of the dry-mesic oak forest Potentillo albae-Quercetum petraeae heaths, and alpine slopes [10, 11]. However, the extensive demand of white cinquefoil rhizomes formedical purposes threatens this species, causing it to be endan-gered or close to depleted in natural habitats [12, 13]. The plant is a vigorous herbaceous perennial 8 -25 cm high with a 35-cm long, oblique, stout, and dun rootstock, i.e., rootsand rhizomes. Rising stalks are often loosely bent and sur-mounted by a rosette of l eaves. Basal leaves are long stalked and palmate with 5 leaflets, while stem leaves are alternate with 3 leaf-lets and short stalked or stalkless. Leaflets have a lanceolate obo-vate shape, toothed at the apex, and silky hair covering under-neath. The stipules are usually smaller and red-yellow colored. Notably, the plant creates 1 to 5 individual flowers occurring in spring, which, in contrast to most Potentilla species, possess five obovate white-colored petals. Moreover, the stamens with whitefilaments occur in the number of 20. There are 5 silvery hairy se-pals and a 5-sectioned epicalyx. The fruit takes the form of mattand lightly ridged achene [10,14,15].Traditional Use Potentilla species have been used in medicine since antiquity [5]. Before the introduction of the modern taxonomy by Linn\u00e9 in1753, P. alba was known as Quinquefolium album and Pentaphyllum album [8]. The first report treating P. alba use dates from 1543 in a New Kre\u00fcterbuch book by Leonhard Fuchs. One of the species de- scribed and chapter \"F\u00fcnffingerkraut \"was white ( \"Gro\u00df Weiss F\u00fcnffingerkraut \"), of which the under- ground parts were used externally to treat inflammation of themouth and throat and toothache. Internal use described for theunderground parts included the treatment of dysentery, ulcers,and jaundice. Aerial part application included the treatment offever, jaundice, fistula, and as an astringent [16]. P. alba was also mentioned in the herbal book Tabernaemontanus dating from 1588, with similar indications for use [17]. Since the 18th century, in Eastern Europe and particularly in Belarusian Polesie, there hasbeen a common practice of using P. decoctions as a substi- tute for Camellia sinensis [18]. White cinquefoil is traditionally used in Eastern Europe to treat diseases of the liver, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinaltract and as a wound healing agent due to its antibacterial activity.Extracts from the aerial parts stimulate the central nervous sys- tem, whereas the underground parts of this plant increase diure- sis, enhance bile secretion, and improve intestinal function. In folkmedicine, an infusion of P. alba roots is prepared for painful men- struation as an antispastic and analgesic agent. A decoction with rhizomes is used for gout, rheumatism, jaundice, anddysentery. In folk medicine of Belarus, it is recommended to drinka decoction of the aerial parts of white cinquefoil when sufferingfrom prolapse of the uterus [19,20]. Currently, the use of an infusion of the underground parts to treat hypo- and hyperthyroidism has been reported as a standardtherapy, especially in Ukraine, Belarus, and the Federation [13,21]. Moreover, phytotherapists in post-Soviet states, especiallyRussia, recommend P. alba as an adaptogen, a treatment for heart diseases, or as a psychostimulant of the central nervous system[22]. However, the only species from the genus Potentilla included in the latest Russian Pharmacopoeia is the Potentilla erecta rhi- zome [23]. Chemical Constituents of Potentilla alba A number of studies have confirmed the occurrence of at least 47 compounds for the rhizomes and/or aerial parts of P. alba that have been isolated or detected and completely identified with theuse of chromatographic and spectral methods. A predominant group of constituents from the underground parts are condensed tannins, with a total procyanidin content es-timated to be 7.3% of the raw material dry mass. However, theauthors of this study did not detect hydrolysable tannins in P. alba rhizomes [24, 25]. Only ellagic acid, as a degradation product ofellagitannins, was identified, apart from gallic acid, a precursor ofhydrolysable tannins [26]. In addition to the precursors ( )-epicatechin oligomeric procyanidines isolated and elucidated [27]. Additionally, two flavonoid 20Augustynowicz D et al. New 19 -29 | \u00a9 2021. Thieme.

Furthermore, from a chemophenetic point of view, the presenceof tormentic acid ( Fig. 1 ) in the subterranean parts of P. alba confirms the general chemical homogeneity in the genus Potentil- la. Moreover, underground parts are rich in fatty acids, polysac- charides, amino acids, and macro- andiodine [28]. Several phytochemical studies have been performed with the aerial parts of P. alba and at least 29 compounds were compl etely identified. The dominant group of compounds were flavonoids,with five compounds identified as flavonoid aglycones and which are kaempferol glycosides. Moreover, several structures of O-glyco- sides have not been completely elucidated. Further ingredients in-clude phenol carboxylic acids, mainly structural Additionally, and trimeric type B proanthocyanidins were elu-cidated from the aerial parts of the plant, connected by 4,8-bonds, such as procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, and trimeric pro-cyanidin C1. The structures of selected procyanidins are present-ed in Fig. 2 . More interestingly, in the leaves of P. alba , catechin, a precursor for proanthocyanidins, was not detected [29], while ina recent work, catechin was present in whole aerial part prepara- tions [30]. Previously, ( )-epicatechin was isolated from the leaves of white cinquefoil [19]. The current status of the phytochemicalconstituents of P. alba is summarized in Table 1 . Due to the limited natural reserves of P. alba , there have been attempts to develop a method allowing the production of theplant using a hydroponics technique with clonal micropropaga-tion. This method may lead to the accumulation of elements fromthe nutrient media in plant organs similar to intact plants. Although the obtained results are promising, there is still an ad- vantage to using intact plants when considering the content ofsecondary metabolites [31, 42]. Researchers in Pyatigorsk (Russia)in the Northern Caucasus worked on recommendations for theconventional cultivation of P. alba . The most convenient method of white cinquefoil reproduction was the division of the rhizomesinto cuttings. Based on the observations of a 3-year project, theauthors concluded that during the first 5 years of life, active plantgrowth and an increase in biomass are noted. By the 5th year of life, the rhizomes are fully formed and suitable for pharmaceuticaluse [43]. In another approach, reported from a great P. alba plan- tation in the Bryansk region (Russia), shoot buds with a piece of the root and two to four leaves were separated manually fromthe mother plant for plant propagation [44]. Pharmacological Profile Preparations based on the aerial part of P. alba have less pharmaco- logical activity than the roots and rhizomes of this plant [19]. In addition to the in vitro and few in vivo studies, a number of publica- tions address clinical studies of rhizome extracts for the treatmentof thyroid gland impairments. An overview of the current status ofpharmacological evaluations of P. alba is outlined in Table 2 . In vitro studies Antioxidative activity The radical scavenging properties were verified for the aerial and underground parts. The abundance of polyphenols, such as flavo- noids and procyanidins, present in the species exerts a protectiveeffect against oxidative damage. A few reports have uncoveredhigh antioxidant properties of various extracts from the herbalparts measured by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), significant additional assays, such as N,N-dimethyl- p-phe- Fig. 1 Structure of tormentic acid.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. nylenediamine (DMPD+), superoxide radical, and hydroxyl radical assays, was reported for water and methanol extracts obtained from rhizomes and roots of P. alba [36,45]. Antimicrobial activity On several occasions, antimicrobial activities of rhizome extracts have been reported. Bosnian authors investigated the antimicro-bial potential of water, ethanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate ex-tracts against selected bacterial and fungal strains albicans ATCC 10 231. Notably, only an acetone preparation at a 1 : 1 dilution and a water preparation at a 1 : 10 dilution revealed moderate inhibitory activity against S. aureus , with zone of inhibition values peaking at 13.4 and 11.0 mm, respectively. Moreover, acetone and alcohol samples in-hibited the growth of the E. coli strain in a manner similar to the reference 2% tannic acid solution. However, the growth of theB. subtilis and C. albicans strains was unaffected by the tested ex- tracts [46]. Interestingly, in comparison to an earlier study, recentresults showed that the extracts from P. alba root exhibited more substantial antibacterial and antifungal activities against E. coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 25923, and C. albicans EMTK strains, with 1.1, 19.0 vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (zone 20.0 \u00b1 1.0 and 23.0 \u00b1 1.2 mm,respectively) was observed [47]. In another study, an aqueous ex-tract of P. alba roots (1 : 10) was shown to be active against the test strains P. aeruginosa, C. albicans ,a n d E. coli after 2- to 4-fold dilution, whereas this extract was even more active againstS. aureus and Bacillus cereus , i.e., after 16- and 32-fold dilution [37]. However, the differences in the obtained results may be ex-plained by the variation in qualitative and quantitative secondarymetabolite composition in the plant tissue and in the type of ob-tained extracts [48] and perhaps also by the different test strains.Chitosan is a polycationic polymer and one of the most wide- spread polysaccharides in nature. It is a waste product from the marine food processing industry. Due to its abundant availability,biocompatibility, biodegradability, and susceptibility to chemicalmodification, a number of researchers are interested in the pro-duction of chitosan-based products and their practical applicationinter alia in the food industry or medicine. In accordance with these advantages, the antimicrobial effects of P. alba herbal de- coction with a chitosan-based film-forming composition was in- vestigated. The tested sample revealed no toxicity or hemolytic activity and inhibited B. cereus growth, with a zone diameter of 34 mm. The authors concluded that the tested preparation couldserve as an excellent and safe remedy to increase the shelf life ofplant-derived products [49]. Antiviral activity A recent study assessed the antiviral potential of P. alba ethanol and water extracts from both intact and regenerative plantsagainst herpes simplex virus type II. The study was carried out inthe Vero cell line. It was demonstrated that water extracts from intact and regenerative plants exhibited anti-herpes activity. However, a weaker antiviral effect was observed for the ethanolextracts [50]. Antineoplastic activity Patients diagnosed with cancer face a variety of problems con-nected with chemotherapy treatment and with a decrease in qual-ity of life. Thus, the scientific world has focused on research forsafer and more effective remedies to increase patient survivabilityand comfort. Although digestive tract cancers are very common, they are still a significant portion of the worldwide death toll. Recently, Polish authors assessed the cytotoxic effects of selectedextracts and fractions of P. alba aerial parts against HT-29 human colon cancer and the CCD 841 CoTr human noncancerous colonepithelial cell line. The study showed that the tested samples af-Table 2 An overview on the current status of pharmacological evaluations of P. alba L.

In particular, extracts abundant in caffeoyl-quinic acids displayed the highest antineoplastic activity due totheir ability to modulate the cell cycle and thus increase apopto-sis. Furthermore, the proliferation of normal colon cells was highlypromoted, despite damage to cell membranes in the investigatedsamples, which mildly affected mitochondrial metabolism [30]. In vivo studies Adaptogenic activity In the scientific literature, there have been only a few in vivo studies. Russian authors, based on the recommendations ofphytotherapists [38], examined the adaptogenic influence of theP. alba rhizome water extract on mice. The experiment comprised swimming endurance, open-field, and light/dark explorationtests. Interestingly, 1-week oral administration of the investigated extract at doses of 36 and 72 mg/kg body weight (b. w.) revealed a significant enhancement in the swimming time in a dose-depen-dent manner. Furthermore, the authors found that high glycogenconcentrations in the treated rodents correlated with prolongedswimming time. However, the exact mechanism is unknown andshould be investigated in the future, but it may involve the anti-oxidant properties that can protect against oxidative damage. Ad-ditionally, P. alba extracts attenuated anxiety symptoms in light/ dark exploration and open-field tests. Although the tested sam- ples at a dose of 72 mg/kg b. w. increased the time spent by micein the light chamber, the effect was not significant. In a separatestudy, animals treated at a dose of 12 mg/kg placed in a novel en-vironment expressed a significant increase in head dip frequencyand the number of squares crossed in comparison to the controlgroup, as well as a reduction in grooming. These results indicatethe anxiolytic potential of P. alba rhizome preparations. Nonethe- less, further phytochemical and pharmacological research is needed to determine the exact mechanism of action and the maincomponents responsible for the observed effects [22]. Anti-inflammatory activity It has been found that administration of the acetone and ethanolextracts from the underground parts of white cinquefoil reducedthe inflammation process in a mouse ear test model. Inflamma-tion was induced by administration of a 3% Crotonis oleum ace- tone solution to the mouse ear 2 hours after a single dose of the tested extracts. The study indicated strong anti-inflammatory ac- tivity of the acetone extract in a manner similar to the reference1% hydrocortisone ointment. However, the activity of the etha-nolic extract was weaker than the reference [51]. Thyroid gland disorders The thyroid gland is an essential part of the human endocrine sys-tem and directly involved in proper organism development andgrowth, as well as adaptation to changing environmental factors.Two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), are partially composed of iodine and are mainly responsible for the regulation of cellular metabolism. Their narrow range of se-rum concentrations are controlled by the thyrotropin-releasinghormone (TRH) released from the hypothalamus hormone thyrotropin (TSH) disorders can be classified thyroid tissue, including euthyroidism, hyperthyroidism,hypothyroidism, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, and abnor-mal thyroid parameters without thyroid diseases. Euthyroidismdisorders are characterized by the normal production of thyroidhormones and their normal levels in the serum. This group in-cludes euthyroid goiter, thyroid tumors, and thyroiditis. However,the overproduction of thyroid hormones leads to primary hyper- thyroidism, which can be caused mainly by diffuse hyperthyroid goiter, Graves disease. However, secondary hyperthyroidism oc- curs with elevated or inappropriately normal TSH levels due topituitary disorders and iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, amongothers. Similarly, hypothyroidism can be divided into primary andsecondary hypothyroidism with the manifestation of decreasedthyroid hormone production. Primary hypothyroidism includesadult iatrogenic and neonatal congenital hypothyroidism. Secondary disorders of thehypothalamic-pituitary axis [53, 54]. Unfortunately, thyroid gland disorders are principally con- nected with an inadequate intake of iodine from the diet, withapproximately one-third of the world s population living in iodine deficient areas, which leads to cognitive impairment in infants andchildren. The prevalence of overt hypothyroidism in Europe ranges from 0.2 to 5.3% [55]. Therefore, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the WHO, together with the UnitedNations Children s Fund (UNICEF) and International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD), derived val-ues for adequate intake and the recommended dietary allowancefor iodine as 150 \u00b5g/day for adults, which increases during preg-nancy and lactation to a value of 200 -250 \u00b5g/day [56,57]. On the other hand, in areas with high iodine intake, a considerable number of thyroid disorders are presumably due to hyperthy- roidism and autoimmune thyroiditis. A meta-analysis of Europeanstudies revealed a mean prevalence rate of overt hyperthyroidismof 0.75% [58]. Despite the great advances in thyroid disorder therapy, the us- age of phytomedicines still offers fewer side effects than syntheticdrugs. However, phytomedicines can be considered a comple-mentary part of comprehensive therapy to treat various thyroid gland disorders. Several species have traditionally been used throughout Europe, Asia, and North America to reduce hyperthy-roidism symptoms. Particularly, herbal medicines such ceae, respectively) exert beneficial effects to reduce hyperthyroid symptoms, as found during in vitro and in vivo studies. The possi- ble mechanism could be complex, including processes such as re-ducing TSH formation and its binding to thyroid follicles, decreas-ing peripheral deiodination of T4, and/or inhibiting the binding ofGraves disease antibodies to thyroid tissue [59,60]. However, the herbal medicines administered to treat hypothyroidism mainly in-volve the supplementation of iodine. The most widely used herbal medicine is bladderwrack ( Fucus vesiculosus L., Fucaceae), which is 25Augustynowicz New Perspectives for Med 2023; 89: 19 -29 | \u00a9 2021. Thieme. All rights reserved.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. traditionally used in folk medicine and contains high quantities of iodine, approximately 50 \u00b5g/g dried mass. Hence, bladderwrackhas been evaluated by the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Prod-ucts (HMPC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which es-tablished that an upper daily limit of iodine intake for bladder-wrack should not exceed 400 \u00b5g/day [61]. Moreover, ex Burseraceae), have been shown to efficiently treat hypothy-roidism; however, biological studies are very limited [62]. Thyrotropic activity of Potentilla alba extracts (roots and vivo studies Recently, Abdreshov et al. ( 2021) reported the influence of Vozrozhdenie plus balm (a preparation containing iodine, starch, ascorbic acid, sodium chloride, glycerine, and gelatine) and aP. alba root extract combination on the condition of adrenergic innervation of the thyroid gland, thyroid blood vessels, lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels in an induced hypothyroidism ratmodel. The specific histochemical fluorescence microscopy meth-od to visualize catecholamines was used to observe changes inthyroid tissue. This analysis demonstrated that the investigatedmixture positively affected the restoration of nerve contours andincreased catecholamine concentrations in thyroid tissue and thesurrounding lymphatic vessels and nodes. However, the authors underlined that the histological changes after treatment were more marked for the lymphatic system than for the thyroid glandtissue [63]. Moreover, the CCl 4extract rich in triterpenes from P. alba whole root segments transformed by Agrobacterium rhizo- genes exhibited a reduction in thyroxine levels in the rat thyroid gland, thus protecting the gland from the damage induced byray irradiation [64]. Additionally, an extract prepared from the root and rhizomes of P. alba was tested in rats with experimental hypothyroidism. Application of the extract raised the levels of the thyroid hormones (T3 and T4 by 34 and 30%, respectively) [65]. Thyrotropic activity of Potentilla alba extracts (roots and rhizomes) -studies in humans The first publication on the thyrotropic activity of white cinquefoil dates from 1975 [13]. White cinquefoil (roots and rhizomes) iscurrently used in traditional medicine throughout Eastern Europeeither alone or as a part of comprehensive therapy against thyroidgland impairments [6]. Based on those reports, several clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the validity and clinical ef- ficacy of the P. alba rhizome extracts. In 2012, three independent clinical trials were performed with the same preparation. Duringthe first trial, 55 patients with diagnosed hyperthyroidism, chron-ic thyroiditis, and diffuse nontoxic goiter during the 6-month trialwere treated with a P. alba preparation containing 300 mg of an extract twice a day. It was found that this treatment reduced thy-roid size and normalized thyroid function, decreased serum anti- body levels against thyrotropin receptor (AB r TSH), and short- ened the time needed to stabilize TSH serum levels [66]. In thesecond study, 77 patients with mixed diffuse and benign goiter di-vided into a control group and an herbal treatment group wereenrolled. The patients in the control group received levothyroxineor thyrostatic therapy, while the treatment group also received a P. alba dry rhizome extract twice a day containing 300 mg per cap- sule for 2 consecutive months. Compared to control therapy, theextract significantly decreased somatic symptoms of hypo- andhyperthyroidism. Significant changes in nodule volume were alsoobserved [67]. Additionally, in another study, the clinical efficacyof a P. alba rhizome extract (300 mg, 2 capsules per day) added to the basic treatment was evaluated according to international guidelines in 46 patients with toxic goiter. Three months of treat- ment improved the structure of the thyroid gland, significantly in-creased thyroid-stimulating hormone, and reduced AB rT S Hl e v - els [68]. A further multicenter clinical study conducted in Ukraineassessed the influence of P. alba rhizome extract on thyroid gland volumes. In brief, 1107 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis,nodular goiter, or diffuse nontoxic goiter were enrolled. Mono-therapy with a dry rhizome extract at a dose of 300 mg was ap- plied twice a day for 6 months. Notably, the preparation de- creased the volume of the thyroid gland by a minimum of 15% inpatients with all investigated impairments. These results showeda significant increase with a higher initial gland volume [69].Moreover, oral administration of the P. alba dry rhizome extract to pediatric patients resulted in a decrease in thyroid size and anormalization of thyroid function [70]. In another clinical trial,the efficacy of a P. alba extract (roots and rhizomes) was in- vestigated in 100 patients with subclinical autoimmune thyroid- itis, i.e., 74 patients (group 1) had subclinical hypothyroidism(characterized by an elevated TSH level with a normal free thyrox-ine level), and 26 patients (group 2) had subclinical hyperthy-roidism (characterized by a low or undetectable TSH level with anormal serum free thyroxine level). All patients received 300 mgof the extract twice a day for 6 months. At the end of the study,there was a normalization of TSH levels in both group 1 and group 2 accompanied by an improvement in general well-being. In both study groups, a significant decrease in the volume of the thyroidgland and improvement in the morphological structure of the thy-roid tissue were observed [71]. Recently, one study described the efficiency and safety of the complex herbal formula Tireoclean, containing P. alba rhizome ex- tract, black chokeberry fruit, redhaw hawthorn, and sodium se-lenite. A total of 60 patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis were enrolled equally in the control and treatment groups. The authors found that a 3-month treatment with the addition of theabovementioned preparation to a complex therapy had a signifi-cant influence on the TSH and free thyroxine levels in only thesubgroup . 8 8\u00b10 . 5 6\u00b5 U / m L a n d 1 . 0 9\u00b10 . 1 1p g / m L b e f o r e t r e a t m e n t a n d4.49 \u00b1 thyroxine, respectively. However, the tested prepara- tion had no influence on the thyroid gland volume [72]. More in- terestingly, in another study, a multicomponent phytopreparation( c o n t a i n i n g8 0m go fa ne x t r a c to f P. alba underground parts and other extracts from underground parts of species such as Filipen- dula vulgaris, Genista tinctoria Gemmae betulae and a leaf extract from Coru- lussp.) was administered to elderly women working in chemical factories suffering from cardiovascular and hypothyroidism disor- ders.

Toxicity Despite the wide usage of white cinquefoil preparations in medi-cine, the full toxicological profile has not been fully exploredthrough studies in humans due to ethical reasons and economic costs. However, animal rodent models are an acceptable alterna- tive to assess the toxicological potential of herbal formulas. There-fore, there is a need to investigate the safety profile of P. alba due to its widespread usage. For the aerial parts of P. alba, an LD 50val- ue of 2359.9 mg/kg b.w. was deduced based on acute toxicitytesting with mice in the dose range of 1000 -4000 mg/kg b.w. Ad- ministration of 239 mg/kg b.w. of the LD 50) in a chronic 3-month toxicity study in rats showed no negative impact on the laboratory animals, i.e., no deaths, no changes in consumption and intake of water, and no changes to the hair. Based on theseresults, the authors classified the aerial part of P. alba as virtually nontoxic according to the Organisation for Economic Co-opera-tion and Development (OECD) classification [74]. Acute andchronic toxicity of a rhizome extract of P. alba was evaluated in mice and rats. It was found that single intraperitoneal and3month chronic administration did not cause toxicity or mortal- ity in the tested rodents [75,76]. For an extract prepared from the underground parts of P. alba with a mixture of ethanol and water, an LD 50value of 6500 mg/kg b.w. was determined in male and female rats [33]. Immunotoxicity studies revealed that the dry rhizome extract from white cinquefoil at a dose of 50 mg/kg b.w. had no negativeimpact on humoral, cellular, or macrophage immunity in the twomouse breeds. Furthermore, a study revealed that P. alba rhizome extract at a dose of 3 mg/kg b. w. administered to albino guinea pigs stimulated the primary humoral response. Moreover, thetested sample had no sensitizing effect in either systemic or activeskin anaphylaxis or delayed hypersensitivity [77]. Moreover, theapplication of an extract of white cinquefoil (underground parts)to mice treated with the cytostatic agent azathioprine led to a de-crease in the suppressive action of the cytostatic agent on anti-body formation and the indirect cellular immune reaction, thus demonstrating the immunomodulatory effects of the extract [78]. Unfortunately, white cinquefoil preparations administeredorally have a negative impact on the ante- and postnatal rat off-spring periods of development, resulting in retardment of the os-sification process occurring in the cartilaginous part of bones of20-day-old fetuses [79]. Furthermore, the same extract had animpact on the male rat reproductive system, resulting in a de-crease in sperm motility and Leydig cell nucleus diameters and an increase in pyknotic nuclei and a higher number of pathological spermatozoa. Despite these observations, the authors concludedthat the extract did not significantly affect rodent fertility or off-spring development after healthy female impregnation [80]. Conclusion/Perspectives Documented evidence suggests that P. alba is a rich source of polyphenolics with a broad spectrum of activities. Studies in hu-mans support the ethnomedical use of P. alba as a monotherapy or as a part of a comprehensive therapy for different thyroid glandimpairments. However, despite promising results, the underlyingmechanism of action, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics of themain active compounds are still unknown. Therefore, furtherstudies should focus deeply on these aspects to fully reveal theirpotential, especially clinical studies, and to further substantiatethe use of P. alba extracts to treat thyroid disorders. Notably, the other problem with the use of P. alba extracts is its gradually end- ing resource in its natural habitat. The highest demand for theunderground parts of P. alba would result in the extinction of this species in the near future. However, several studies have beenconducted to develop efficient renewable raw plant materialswith similar elemental and secondary metabolite compositions.
