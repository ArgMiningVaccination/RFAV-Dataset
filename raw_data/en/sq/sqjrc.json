Vision Rush will be the leading academic health system in the region and nationally recognized for transforming health care . Core Values \"I CARE\" Innovation CollaborationAccountabilityRespectExcellence History of Rush University Medical Center Rush University Medical Center is one of Chicago's oldest health care organizations . Its heritage extends back to 1837, when Rush Medical College was established . St . Luke' s Hospital, founded in 1864, and Presbyterian Hospital, founded in 1883, merged in 1956 to form Presbyterian-St . Luke' s Hospital . T he subsequent incorporation of these pioneer institutions in 1969 created Rush-Presbyterian-St . Luke' s Medical Center, which was renamed Rush University Medical Center in October 2003 . Rush is a not-for-profit academic medical center comprising Rush University Medical Center, Rush University, Rush Oak Park Hospital and Rush Health . Renowned Patient Care Rush University Medical Center encompasses a 664-bed hospital serving adults and children, including the Johnston R . Bowman Health Center, which provides medical and rehabilita-tive care to older adults and people with short- and long-term disabilities . It includes Rush's 376-bed Tower hospital building, which opened in 2012 as part of the Medical Center's major campus renovation . Rush's commitment to sustainability innov ation earned the Tower LEED Gold certification . It is the largest new construction health care project in the world to be LEED Gold certified . Rush's renov ation also includes Rush's Orthopedic Building, which opened in 2010, and the ongoing campus-wide implementation of an electronic medical record system, enhanc- ing patient care and safety . A unique combination of research and patient care has earned Rush national rankings in 9 of 16 specialty areas in U.S. News & World Report's 2013-14 America's Best Hospitals issue, among other recognitions of our quality of care and accreditations . Our nurses are at the forefront of our efforts to provide quality care, receiving Magnet status three times for making outstanding nursing care the standard at the Medical Center . Rush was the first hospital in Illinois serving adults and children to receive Magnet status \u2014 the highest honor in nursing \u2014 and the first in Illinois to earn a third four-year designation . And some of the world's best athletes trust themselves to the hands of our physicians . Rush is proud to be the preferred hospi - tal for the Chicago Bulls . Educating Future Health Care Providers Rush University is home to one of the first medical colleges in the Midwest and one of the nation's top-ranked nursing col-leges, as well as graduate programs in allied health, health sys - tems management and biomedical research . T he Medical Center also offers many highly selective residency and fellowship programs in medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties . Rush's unique practitioner-teacher model for health sciences education and research gives students the opportunity to learn from world-renowned instructors who practice what they teach . Committed to Community In addition to patient care, education and research, Rush maintains a strong commitment to the community . Many students, faculty and staff at Rush generously donate their time and skills both within and outside of the Medical Center . T heir efforts include numerous health outreach projects in which Rush collaborates with neighborhood clinics, churches, schools and other organizations to provide health screenings and vital health information for underserved children and adults . Our education and research endeavors, community service pro-grams and relationships with other hospitals are dedicated to enhancing excellence in patient care for the diverse communities of the Chicago area \u2014 now and in the future .10 Larry J . Goodman, MD , is CEO of Rush University Medical Center and President of Rush University . He also serves as president of the Rush System for Health, and he is the principal officer of the Rush Board of Trustees . Rush University Mission, Vision and Values Mission Rush University provides outstanding health sciences educa- tion and conducts impactful research in a culture of inclusion, focused on the promotion and preservation of the health and well being of our diverse communities . Vision The Rush learning community will be the leading health sciences university committed to transforming health care through innovative research and education . Core Values As the academic component of Rush University Medical Center, the University shares the Medical Center's core values: innovation, collaboration, accountability, respect and excellence . These I CARE values guide the efforts of Rush University students, faculty and researchers History of Rush University Rush University is the academic component of Rush University Medical Center . Founded in 1972, the University has expanded from one college and fewer than 100 students to four colleges and over 2,100 students . It includes Rush Medical College, Rush University College of Nursing, the College of Health Sciences and the Graduate College . Rush Medical College is named for Benjamin Rush, a physi-cian from Pennsylvania, who also signed the Declaration of Independence . Rush Medical College was chartered in 1837 and opened officially on December 4, 1843, with 22 students enrolled in a 16-week course . During the first century of opera - tion, more than 10,000 physicians received their training at Rush Medical College . Rush Medical College was affiliated with the University of Chicago from 1898 until 1942, when the medical college temporarily suspended its educational program, though it continued its corporate existence . Its faculty contin - ued undergraduate and graduate teaching of medicine and the biological sciences as members of the faculty of the University of Illinois . The charter of the medical college was reactivated in 1969 when it became part of the Medical Center . Rush Medical College reopened in 1971 with a class of 66 first-year students and 33 third-year students . First-year class size reached its projected maximum of 120 in 1976 . Rush University College of Nursing represents a combined heritage dating back to the late nineteenth century when its first antecedent, the St . Luke' s Hospital School of Nursing, opened in 1885 to offer diploma education to nurses . In 1903, the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing accepted its first students . From 1956 to 1968 nurses were taught at the merged Presbyterian-St . Luke' s Hospital School of Nursing . Before the establishment of the College of Nursing in 1972, more than 7,000 nurses had graduated from these three schools . The College of Health Sciences, established in 1975, traces its origins to the School of Medical Technology sponsored by Presbyterian-St . Luke' s Hospital from 1959 to 1972 . T his school was the second largest of its kind in the city of Chicago . During its operation, it provided a one-year professional internship program to more than 200 baccalaureate students in medical technology . Today, the College of Health Sciences offers doctoral programs in audiology and health sciences, ten programs at the master's level, and bachelor's programs in health sciences, imag - ing sciences, medical laboratory science, perfusion technology, respiratory care and vascular ultrasound technology . The Graduate College was established as a separate aca- demic unit in January 1981, having previously been organized as the Graduate School within the College of Health Sciences . The Graduate College is responsible for educational programs in the basic sciences and offers master's and doctoral degrees in twelve disciplines . The Seal of Rush University The seal of Rush University is a shield, a classic Greek symbol of preservation and protection and also a medieval British emblem used for identification . As such, it recognizes the University's overarching commitment to educating health professionals who preserve life and protect patients, and it is the distinguishing identification of Rush University . Its two colors, green and gold, merge the tradition of the past with the custom of the present as gold was the single historical color of Rush Medical College and green is used for the modern Medical Center .11 The motto, ministrare per scientiam , translated from Latin, means to minister (care for or serve) through scientific knowledge . It was adopted by the Board of Trustees in September 1993 to reflect the commitment to educate caring professionals whose practice is based in knowledge . The shadow in the background is the anchor cross, a symbol of hope and steadfastness, which became the emblem of the merged Presbyterian and St . Luk e's hospitals in 1957 and the foundation that created the vision for Rush University . Superimposed on top is the stylized version of the anchor cross that was adopted in 1971 upon the merger of Rush Medical College and Presbyterian-St . Luk e's Hospital . The final elements are Chicago, the city that is home to the University, and the date of the University's founding, 1972 . The Rush University Board of Overseers adopted the seal in 1999 .

Drug Free Campus and Workplace Rush University Medical Center is committed to achieving and maintaining a drug-free campus and workplace . T he Medical Center has established a drug-free policy consistent with its commitment and goals . T he policy states in part: The illegal manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, sale and/ or possession of controlled substances on Medical Center prop-erty or while performing Medical Center business is strictly pro-hibited. An employee or student engaged in any such conduct will be subject to discipline up to and including expulsion or termination. In addition, students and employees are subject to all applicable criminal penalties under local, state or federal law for unlawful possession or distribution of illicit drugs and alco-hol. Within five days of the conviction, employees and students must report to the Medical Center any conviction for violation of a criminal drug statute occurring within the Medical Center. The health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol are many and varied. Some drugs may cause psychological and physical dependence or addiction. Others attack the central nervous system, making the user dangerous to himself and others. In the extreme, they can result in convul-sions, psychosis, coma and possible death. Tobacco-Free Work Environment Rush University Medical Center supports the surgeon general's report on use of tobacco products as a major cause of prevent- able death . Tobacco use has been documented to contribute significantly to health problems of those who engage in the practice, and those who are subjected to an environment where smoke is present . Rush University Medical Center, to be consistent with its mission, seeks to promote the health, safety and quality of life of all people who come to the Rush Campus . 1 . In accordance with these standards, Rush University Medical Center prohibits smoking or the use of tobacco by all employ-ees, patients, visitors, physicians, students, faculty, volunteers and contractors on the Medical Center campuses . 2 . Regarding premises outside Rush University Medical Center campuses, smoking or the use of tobacco is prohibited in all other buildings or on grounds owned, leased, or controlled by Rush University Medical Center wherever located, including adjacent public sidewalks and adjoining properties . T his policy may be limited by the policies of the landlord or 3rd party tenants of such premises . 3 . Smoking or tobacco use is prohibited in Rush University Medical Center owned, leased, or controlled vehicles wherever located . 4 . Smoking or tobacco use is prohibited within 15 feet of all Rush shuttle bus stops, immediately adjacent to Rush University Medical Center campuses . 5 . Signs are posted at each entrance indicating Rush University Medical Center is a tobacco-free environment . 6 . Potential new hires will be informed of the tobacco-free work environment at the time of employment application . 7 . Current tobacco use will be asked at time of health screening . Those with a positive history will be given referral information for smoking cessation . 8 . The tobacco-free work environment and policy will be reviewed at new employee orientation . 9 . While this policy does not require employees to quit tobacco use, Rush University Medical Center supports and encourages all efforts by employees to quit tobacco use . 10 . The Medical Center offers smoking cessation and coping programs to employees and encourages them to participate . For more information, please contact ChooseHealth@rush . edu or (312) 942-7479 .16 11 . It is the responsibility of all Medical Center staff, faculty, students and employees to ensure compliance with this policy . Enforcement of this policy is a shared responsibility of all hospital personnel . 12 . Employees violating this policy will be subject to disciplinary action (see Human Resources Policy and Procedure Code of Conduct) . Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Inclusion For over three decades, the Rush approach to equal opportunity, diversity and inclusion has not wavered . Our approach is that these are essential components of the best employment, edu- cational and health care practices and must be furthered . T his is a continuation of a policy that emanated from the hospital charters of 1865 and 1883 and the documents governing the establishment of Rush University in 1972 . In certain instances, the implementation of this policy and our goals in this area require the use of affirmative initiatives .

Priority one: Returning undergraduate, graduate and profes-sional students who apply for on-campus housing by the advertised deadline . Priority two: Incoming undergraduate, graduate and professional students who begin their academic programs in the summer academic term and have been accepted for admission and apply by April 15 . Priority three: Incoming undergraduate, graduate and profes-sional students who begin their academic programs in the fall academic term and have been accepted for admission and apply for housing by May 1 . These priorities will be used as a guide when assigning housing . Returning students who fail to submit a housing application for the succeeding year prior to the advertised deadline will lose their number one priority . Rush University reserves the right to make exceptions to these priorities when extenuating circum- stances exist . Apartment types available: Notification of acceptance into University housing will be sent to each student assigned to on-campus housing . New students must receive an acceptance for admission to the University before any housing notification will be sent .

Studio Apartment One student One Bedroom Apartment One to two students Two Bedroom Apartment Two to four students23 Consolidation Policy In an effort to maximize the number of on-campus housing spaces available to Rush University students, consolidation of tenants may occur . T his consolidation policy will affect only those students who occupy an apartment by themselves that was originally leased to two or more students . Such a situation can occur when a roommate leaves University housing during the course of the academic year . If consolidation is necessary, students involved will be informed in writing . At that time the student will have the following options: 1) share an apartment with another student in any building who is also in need of a roommate, 2) find a Rush University student roommate of his or her choice, 3) have a roommate assigned from the available applications, or 4) pay the full rent of the apartment . If the fourth option is chosen, the apartment will become a single accommodation only through the end of the current lease . If the student wishes to renew the lease, the student will have the option of remaining in the apartment with the understand-ing that he or she will receive a roommate or will be given an opportunity to move to another available apartment .

Examples of conduct that would subject a student to disciplin-ary action include but are not limited to: All forms of academic dishonesty including but not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; collusion; gaining or seeking unfair advantage in relation to any work submitted; helping others to gain an unfair advantage; removing examination materials from a secure examination area; the unauthor - ized downloading or copying of examinations that are given online; fabricating assigned academic work, including clinical assessments, and presenting them as authentic; facilitating academic dishonesty; unauthorized examination behavior Obstruction or disruption of teaching, research, adminis - tration, clinical practice and community outreach or other University/Medical Center activities Falsification of student records, transcripts or financial aid forms or applications Theft of or damage to University/Medical Center property or the property of a member of the University/Medical Center community Threatened or physical abuse of any person or action that threatens or endangers the safety of others28 Misrepresentation, falsification, alteration, or misuse of the University/Medical Center documents, records or identifica- tion, or research data Unauthorized use or entry of University/Medical Center facilities Conviction of a crime deemed serious enough to render the student unfit to pursue his or her profession Conduct that is inconsistent with the ethical code of the profession the student is preparing to enter Unlawful use or possession of controlled substances on the Medical Center campus Unauthorized possession or concealment of firearms or other weapons on Medical Center premises at any time Attempting to gain access to another's email or computer account, username or password Knowingly setting off false fire, safety or security alarms An accusation of student and/or faculty academic dishonesty or misconduct made in bad faith Rush University Honor Code Rush University Honor Code I pledge that my academic, research, and/or clinical work will be of the highest integrity . I shall neither give nor receive unauthorized aid . I shall not represent the work of others as my own . I shall not engage in scientific misconduct, and I shall treat all persons with the greatest respect and dignity, just as the ethical codes of Rush University Medical Center and my future profes- sion demand . I recognize that behaviors that impede learning or undermine academic, research, and clinical evaluation, including but not limited to falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism, are inconsis- tentwith Rush University values and must be reported . Implementation of the Honor Code This Honor Code (from now on referred to as the Code) sets the standards for expected professional behavior within the University and the Medical Center . Commitment to this Code is a shared responsibility of all faculty, staff, and students within the Rush University community to ensure the highest standards of behavior, whether in the classroom, the laboratory, or in the clinical setting, and to ensure that education obtained at Rush provides a sound foundation for each student's future success as an academic, scientific, or healthcare professional .Code Enforcement Any violations of this Code or suspicion of student or academic misconduct should be reported to the student's college for further review in accordance with the procedures specified by that college . Each college will be expected to set standards for addressing Honor Code violations and cases of misconduct in a fair and consistent manner that best fits their respective student population . Students refusing to sign must submit a letter to their Dean's office explain-ing why, and adherence to the Code is required for matriculation, whether or not the document has been signed . T he Code may also be enforced for off campus actions when the student is representing himself or herself as a member of the University . Commitment By signing below, I affirm my commitment to this Code and pledge to act with integrity and adhere to the Rush University values of Innovation, Collaboration, Accountability, Respect, and Excellence . I understand that this signed document becomes part of my perma-nent record, and I must uphold the letter and spirit of this Code throughout my Rush education . Inappropriate Degree Usage A student may not refer to himself or herself as having earned a specific degree until: All degree requirements have been successfully completed, A completed Degree Approv al Form has been submitted to the Office of the Registrar, and The official date of graduation for a particular term has been reached . A student who disregards this policy will be referred to the commit-tee that addresses professional ethics violations for that student's program or college . Continuous Enrollment Rush University requires continuous enrollment in the majority of its academic programs from the time a student matriculates through a student's graduation . Exemptions for the summer term only include both first-year medical students and Health Systems Management majors . Students who are not officially enrolled or have not submit - ted a Petition for Leave of Absence or Voluntary Withdrawal form risk being administratively withdrawn from the University . A student enrolled in a noncredit residency or academic enrichment program prior to receipt of his or her degree must be registered for the Continuous Enrollment course to retain his or her student status .29 Any degree or certificate student not enrolling in a new course but needing to replace an outstanding incomplete grade must register for the Continuous Enrollment course until the grade is satisfied . A student who is auditing a course and not allowed in other courses during the same term must register for the Continuous Enrollment course to be charged appropriately . Credit by Proficiency A student who passes a proficiency examination at Rush University will earn academic credit toward the degree . Programs have the discretion to offer credit by proficiency (e .g ., standardized examinations such as ACT-PEP Challenge or Advanced Placement Exams) and/ or achieved prior learning (such as Continuing Education Units) . Rush Medical College does not offer credit by proficiency . Credit by proficiency and/or achieved prior learning is based upon documented equivalence with courses offered by the program . The minimum standards and format for demonstrat - ing proficiency are determined by program faculty . Formats for demonstrating proficiency may include departmentally devel-oped examinations, licensure/certification exams, portfolios, and competency demonstrations . Credit awarded by proficiency will equal the credit value of the course(s) as listed in the Rush University Catalog under which the student matriculated . Information that is posted on the transcript for approved credit is the prefix, number, and title of the course section, the credits awarded, and the grade of \"K\" . Credit for the course will appear in the appropriate term as credit earned . Credit earned by this mechanism will not be used in calculating the student's grade point average (GPA) . A fee or partial tuition related to what the student would have been charged may be assessed . Academic Credit Academic credit is awarded to a student upon the success-ful completion of an approved instructional course or by the demonstration of competencies, proficiencies, or fulfillment of learning outcomes equivalent to that provided by an approved instructional course . One unit of academic credit is the measure of the total time commitment a typical student is expected to devote to learning per week of study . Total time devoted to learning includes but is not limited to: classroom or faculty instruction in either a synchronous or asyn-chronous mode; time devoted to individual conferences with instructors; reading and completion of learning activities and assignments; posting in online discussion folders; performance demonstrations; examinations; work associated with comple-tion theses, or dissertations; labora-tory work; clinical practica; or any other activity required of the student . One hour of credit is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that reasonably approximates not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approxi-mately 15 weeks for one semester or one trimester hour of credit or 10 to 12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit or the equivalent of at least 37 .5 hours of work for one semester or one trimester hour of credit or 25 hours of work for one quarter hour of credit . In this context, an hour of work is defined as 50 minutes . Course credits are not calculated for Rush Medical College and 2nd- or 3rd-year Physician Assistant Studies courses; however, the number of weeks of clinical experiences appears on the student's transcript . Credit hour assignment for time spent in clinical practica, internships, seminars, and laboratory work vary according to college or program requirements . Grade Point Average The student's undergraduate and graduate transcripts show a grade point average (GPA) for each term in which grade points were earned and show cumulative GPA for all work taken at Rush in a particular academic level . When a course is repeated, only the most recent attempt is computed in the GPA; although all grades will display on the transcript . No grade points are assigned for work taken on a pass/no pass basis, and therefore, are not computed in the grade point average . Undergraduate students who are required to enroll in courses that typically are taught at the graduate level will have these courses count toward their undergraduate programs of study; thus the credits and grade points will be calculated as part of the undergraduate transcript . Grade Report Students can access RUConnected for their grade report . Grade reports are not mailed to students . Printed copies of a student's grade report are unofficial and intended for the student's personal use and should not be accepted by another college/ university in lieu of an official transcript .30 Grading and Numbering System Grade Points Description A 4 .0 Excellent B 3 .0 Good C 2 .0 Satisfactory for undergraduates but may not be acceptable at the graduate level D 1 .0 Minimal pass for some undergraduate progr ams . May not be acceptable at graduate level . Not used at the graduate level by the College of Nursing, The Graduate College, or the Department of Health Systems Management . F 0 Failure P 0 Passing HP 0 High Pass (only used by Rush Medical College for 3rd- and 4th-year clinical courses) N 0 No Pass H 0 Honors (only used by Rush Medical College) W 0 Withdrew between weeks 2 through 5; also used by Rush Medical College when a circumstance beyond the student's control prevents completion of course requirements regardless of withdraw al date during the quarter WP 0 Withdrew passing between weeks 6 through 10; for courses with a Pass/No-P ass Grading basis WF 0 Withdrew failing between weeks 6 through 10; for courses with a Letter (A-F) Grading basis WN 0 Withdrew not passing between weeks 6 through 10 K 0 Credit earned through proficiency examination T 0 Credit accepted in transfer from another college/university CIP/IP 0 Course in progress and grade not reported I 0 Incomplete NR 0 No Record (not used after summer 2009) CC 0 Course continues into the next term . Grade received at end of series is grade for entire course AU 0 Audit XX 0 Participation in an ungr aded course or residency31 Graduation and Commencement Registration Students must be registered for the term in which they graduate . Application for Graduation Only Rush University students who are candidates for a degree may participate in the commencement ceremony . Certificate candidates are ineligible to participate . Although Rush University has multiple graduation dates during which degrees are conferred, the University has only one com- mencement ceremony . Students are invited to participate in the commencement cer - emony if: They graduated in the fall, winter or spring term immediately preceding the current academic year's ceremony They are anticipated to graduate at the end of the spring or summer terms that immediately follow the current academic year's ceremony Doctoral students writing a dissertation and master's students writing a thesis must provide the title of their dissertation/thesis by the date indicated on the Degree Approval Form in order to have that title included in the commencement program . Publication of a student's name, academic credentials and/or dissertation/thesis title in the commencement program does not indicate that a degree has been officially conferred by Rush University . Students must be registered for the term in which they graduate . All degree-seeking students must submit both Intent to Graduate and Degree Approval forms to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadlines . Students who do not submit either the Intent to Graduate form or the Degree Approval form by the published deadline risk a delayed graduation and may be charged a processing fee . The student's signature on the Intent to Graduate form signals that the student is ready to graduate; allows, only for purposes of the ceremony, the release of directory information restric-tions enacted by the student through his or her signature on the Directory Information Restriction form; permits release of the student's name and address to the external photography vendor with whom Rush contracts and to have the vendor place pho-tographs of the student on its website; permits the University to publish the student's picture in a picture composite; for medical students, permits publication of the student's name, photograph, prior degrees and universities/colleges attended in the Rush Medical College yearbook; permits Rush University to print and/or announce the following: Student's name as indicated on the Intent to Graduate form Honors or awards received Previous colleges/universities attended and Prior degrees earned The Degree Approval form must be submitted after all academic degree requirements are completed . T hese include: All program prerequisites, including general education requirements All courses required in the major program of study and completion of required cumulative credit hours Residency requirements Dissertation/thesis defense (if required by college) Submission of the dissertation/thesis to the library (if applicable) Achievement of the minimum cumulative GPA of 2 .0 for undergraduate and 3 .0 for graduate students (not applicable to Rush Medical College) Awarding of Degrees Rush University degrees are dated the day following the last day of the term in which the degree requirements are com- pleted . Degree requirements must be fully met before the next term officially begins; otherwise, the student will be required to register for the subsequent term and will graduate at the end of that term . The student's transcript, diploma and other notifica - tion of degree conferrals will be held until a student's financial obligation has been met . Outstanding financial obligations have no effect on the awarding of degrees . Latin Honors Candidates for the Bachelor of Science degree who have demonstrated academic excellence are honored at commence- ment by the Rush University faculty . T hose earning a 3 .40 to 3 .59 cumulative grade point average at Rush are awarded the Bachelor of Science degree cum laude; 3 .60 to 3 .79, magna cum laude; 3 .80 to 4 .00, summa cum laude . Only Rush University courses are calculated into the GPA . Latin honors appear on the student's transcript and diploma and are typi-cally announced during the graduation exercises, including the Commencement ceremony and at college/departmental convo- cation/awards ceremonies .32 Graduation Prizes and Awards Many prizes and awards are given at the time of graduation . Award winners are identified in the Commencement ceremony program and in college/departmental convocation/awards ceremony programs . Thesis/Dissertation Requirements for Graduation Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates must complete a dis- sertation . The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program requires completion of a scholarly project . Some master's progr ams require a thesis to meet degree requirements . Each thesis/dissertation/scholarly project must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university . Each student will have a committee whose role is to assure that the student's thesis/dissertation/scholarly project is of high quality and meets the standards of the program and the University for originality, contribution to the field, and scholarly presentation . Review of a thesis/dissertation/scholarly project will follow the sequence of steps as described by each college, including the prescribed preparation manual for each degree . Students must give a public presentation of the knowledge developed through the thesis/dissertation/scholarly project process to the academic community . Public presentation of the thesis/dissertation/scholarly project must precede the final approval by the thesis or dissertation committee . A copy of the thesis/dissertation must be approved by the Director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center for conformance to publishing requirements and copyright compli- ance . Scholarly projects are not reviewed by the library .

Students must comply with annual health and immunization requirements . Students who do not submit the proper proof of fulfilled health and immunization requirements by the designated deadline will be prohibited from registering for the next term and may be disengaged from the program until these requirements are met . Late registration fees will apply . Students should be aware that clinical sites outside of Rush may have additional requirements . Students with a medical or religious exemption will be required to adhere to state and hospital policies concerning infection control . Incomplete Grades The grade of incomplete (\"I\") is given only when circumstances beyond the student's control prevent completion of course requirements and the student has received permission to defer completion of these unmet course requirements . Students must be enrolled during the term in which course requirements are completed . Students enrolling only to com - plete requirements for a course in which a grade of incomplete was given must register for the Continuous Enrollment course (XXX999) for zero or one credit hours . Upon completion of the course requirements the (\"I\") grade will be replaced by the new grade earned in the course . A student receiving a grade of (\"I\") in a course may not begin another course for which the incomplete course is a prerequisite . A student who fails to remove the incomplete grade within the specified time period will receive a final grade of \"F\" or \"N\" in the course . It is the student's responsibility to pursue the completion of an incomplete grade .Students in the College of Nursing, the College of Health Sciences, or the Graduate College and students-at-large must complete the unmet course requirements, typically within one term after the term in which the incomplete grade was assigned and not to exceed one calendar year, unless an extension is approved . Students in the College of Nursing may not register for new courses if they have two or more incomplete grades . Rush Medical College students will be informed by the course instructor and the Office of Medical Student Programs regarding the specific time frame in which an incomplete grade must be resolved . Additional college-specific policies may apply . Pass/No Pass Grading Option Designated letter grade courses may be taken as pass/no-pass based on approval by the course/program director . T he pass/no- pass option is college and course specific, as is the proportion of courses that can be taken pass/no pass . T he decision to take a course for a pass/no pass grade cannot be changed after the first Friday of the term . Repeated Courses Some courses, such as research and clinical courses, may be repeated . These are usually indicated in the course description . All grades and grade points are counted in the GPA for these courses . For all other courses that are repeated, only the most recent grade is counted in the GPA . Both the original course and the repeated course appear on the student's transcript . Repeated Courses: Rush Medical College All instances of a course are represented on the student's official transcript . Course and exam remediations are also represented . Room Reservations To schedule the use of classrooms, lecture halls and auditoriums in the Armour Academic Center, individuals should request a room from the Office of the Registrar . T he Office of the Registrar will assist in making room reservations for classes, meetings and campus events based on room availability . Priority for rooms is given to instructional/class meetings, followed by standing meetings, ad-hoc meetings, student organizations and other requests on a first-come, first-served basis . Student events must have the approval of the Office of Student Life regarding the date/time and either the organization faculty sponsor's or the Office of Student Life's verification regarding the sponsorship of the event . 34 RULearning (Blackboard) RULearning (Blackboard) is a web-based learning management system for course management and delivery . Instructors may use Blackboard to provide students with course materials, discus- sion boards, online exams, virtual chats and more . T he degree to which Blackboard is used in a course varies . Some courses may be conducted entirely online through Blackboard, without any on-campus sessions, while others may use Blackboard as a supplement to face-to-face sessions . Account Creation Students will have RULearning accounts created for them automatically when they have a Rush email account created and register for a course that requires Blackboard access . Students will receive their RULearning account through their Rush email . Account Deactivation RULearning accounts for students will remain active for the dura - tion of their affiliation with the university . Students' accounts will be deactivated 14 days after their graduation or their affiliation with the University ends . Course Availability and Retention Courses in RULearning are available to students on the start date of the term . Courses will be retained in RULearning for one year past their expected end date . At the end of this period of time , courses will be archived and removed from RULearning . Students will be informed how to download relevant information from their courses that they might need after leaving Rush . System Availability The Blackboard system is available on campus via the Rush network and off campus via public Internet . System maintenance is performed every Sunday between 2 a .m . and 6 a .m . Central time . The system may be unavailable during this time .

Students-at-large may be removed from a course if degree- or certificate-seeking students need to enroll in that class . If a student-at-large is removed from a class the student has already paid for, a full refund will be issued . A student may accumulate no more than 12 credit hours of academic credit as a student-at-large . T hese hours may be taken within one term or over a period of time . Registration as a student-at-large that results in more than the allowable number of hours in the student-at-large status can only be authorized by the Dean or Associate Dean of the college offering the course(s) . Credit earned as a student-at-large will not necessarily apply toward a Rush degree, if the individual is subsequently admitted to a degree program . Any incomplete (\"I\") grade earned as a student-at-large will revert to a permanent failing grade (\"F\") unless completed by the end of the next academic term . It is the student's responsi - bility to pursue the completion of an incomplete grade . Student-at-Large Registration forms are only accepted during the designated priority registration period for continuing stu- dents for the term in question . Late forms will only be accepted if authorized by the Dean or Associate Dean of the college offer - ing the course(s) .

In order to be con - sidered for admission an applicant must be considered in good academic standing .35 Student Email Accounts Rush University creates an email account for each student during the student's first term . Students are expected to check their email account with regular frequency since Rush University considers email an official means of communication . Often, students are notified of important news and deadlines via the campus email system . Students should also use the Rush email account to communicate with faculty and staff versus sending an email using a personal email account . Should problems arise with the email account, please contact the Help Desk at (312) 942-4357 or via email at help@rush . edu .

Copies issued to students will be stamped in red ink as \"Issued to Student .\" All transcripts bear the signature of the University registrar or the registrar's designate . Transfer Credit Rush University may accept up to 90 quarter hours or 60 semester hours of credit toward General Education and other lower-level course requirements . Graduate-level transfer credit is subject to the approval of the major advisor, program or division director, or designated college administrator based on an evaluation of quality and equivalence . 37 For graduate-level programs, no more than one-third of the total number of required credits may be granted to a student as transfer credit for work done at another graduate institution . Rush University will not refuse to consider transfer credit based on the accreditation of the sending institution . Continuing Education Units cannot be transferred in for credit . Undergraduate courses must be completed with a \"C\" or better to be awarded credit . Graduate courses must be completed with a \"B\" or better to be awarded transfer credit . Only letter-graded courses are eligible for evaluation as transfer credit; pass/no-pass courses will not be considered . Undergraduate-level courses cannot be transferred to meet the requirements of a course taught at the graduate level at Rush . Transfer credits can only be applied to satisfy the degree require - ments of one program . Once applied, they cannot be used a second time for a new degree program . Previously earned program credits at Rush University may only be used to satisfy the requirements of another program if they are at the same level (e .g ., master's or PhD) and if they meet the current curricular standards . T he number of credits granted for a given course cannot exceed the number awarded for the course on the transcript of the school where the course was taken or the number earned for the corresponding course at Rush University . Credits earned on the quarter system will be converted into semester credits where applicable . A quarter credit is equal to two-thirds of a semester credit (e .g ., three quarter-system credits equal two semester credits) . Course information (including grades) from transferred courses is not recorded on the student's transcript; only the number of credits is recorded and added to the cumulative number of credits . Registration Adding/Dropping Courses The first Friday of the term is the last day a course can be added . A course dropped during the first week of the term will not appear on the student's transcript . After that date , one of the following applies: Course dropped in weeks 2-5: Gr ade of W will be issued for the course Course dropped in weeks 6-end of course: Gr ade of WP (Withdrew Passing), WF (Withdrew Failing), WN (Withdrew Not Passing) will be issued . No course may be dropped after the last day of classes or after a final evaluation of the student has been delivered . No withdrawals are allowed during the final examination period . Rush Medical College students wishing to change their clinical schedules must contact the Office of Medical Student Programs at least four weeks before the start of the scheduled rotation . For additional information concerning tuition refunds, please refer to Financial Affairs: Tuition Refund Policy . Auditing a Course A student wishing to attend a course without completing all the requirements for credit must register to audit the course with permission of the program director . If space in class is limited, continuing and new students have priority . Registration in a course cannot be changed from audit to credit or credit to audit after the first week of the term . Fees associated with auditing a course are listed in the Tuition and Fee Schedule . Auditing of laboratory or clinical courses is prohibited . An auditing student: May participate in class discussion only at the invitation of the course director Is prohibited from taking examinations Is expected to attend class An audited course will appear on the student's transcript with the designation of \"AU\" . If the student does not attend the class, a grade of \"W\" will be assigned . A student who has audited a course may not apply for credit for that course at a later time . Earning a grade and receiving credit for the course can only occur by enrolling in and paying for the course during the term it is offered . Rush Medical College does not allow students to audit Rush Medical College courses except with the permission of Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) . Course Schedule The Course Schedule is available through the RUConnected stu- dent portal . Typically, the Course Schedule will be available one week before the two-week registration period begins . T he Office of the Registrar will generally send an email announcement to 38 students' Rush University email accounts regarding availability of the course schedule . Registration dates and deadlines are also published in the academic calendar . Changes to the course schedule, including updates to meet- ing times, instructors, classrooms and added/closed/canceled courses, will be updated in RUConnected . Independent Study To register for independent study, the education coordinator or course instructor offering the course will approve the course and its objectives, then forward the independent study course request form, including instructor, course title, course descrip-tion, number of credit hours and grading system, to the Office of the Registrar . The Office of the Registrar will create the course in the student information system . Once the course has been created, the Office of the Registrar will contact the education coordinator or course instructor and inform them of the status of the course . The education coordinator or course instructor will inform the student when the course is available, and the student will regis- ter for the course using RUConnected . Nursing students complete an Independent Study Contract form, which is available in the Office of the Registrar or online . On this form the objectives of the study are defined, a plan to meet those objectives is described, etc . T his form should be completed and approved by the preceptor, the department chair and the program director no later than the first day of the quarter in which the independent study is to be taken . T he student's preceptor keeps the contract . Health Systems Management stu - dents also complete a separate independent study form, which is available in the Department of Health Systems Management . Registration Process Each term the Course Schedule is available on the RUConnected student portal . Classes are filled on a first-come, first-served basis according to the following order of priority: 1 . Continuing students 2 . New students 3 . Students-at-large It is the responsibility of continuing students to register using RUConnected each term during the designated two-week regis- tration period for continuing students . Late fees may be applied to students who register outside of the designated registration period .To register for any given term, students cannot have a registra- tion hold (i .e ., missing transcripts, missing/out-of-date immuni - zations, insurance waivers, financial holds, etc .) . If the hold is removed before the end of the registration period, the student can register himself or herself without penalty . If the hold is not removed by the end of the registration period, the student will need to register with the Office of the Registrar as soon as the hold is resolved and will be assigned a late registration fee . Registration is complete only when tuition and other charges for the term are paid or satisfactory arrangements for payment are made . Tuition is always due on the first day of the term . Students who register for a class and subsequently decide to withdraw without completing an Add/Drop, Leave of Absence or Voluntary Withdrawal form will receive a failing grade (F or N) for that course . Withdrawal/Leave of Absence Administrative Withdrawal Administrative withdrawal refers to a permanent departure from the University that is University-initiated and without expecta- tion of the student's return . Rush University requires continuous enrollment in most of its programs from the time a student matriculates through a student's graduation . Students are required to be registered each term or on an approved leave of absence . If the student has decided to withdraw from Rush, voluntary withdrawal paperwork must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar before the voluntary withdrawal will become official . A student who is not registered, is not on an approved leave of absence or has not submitted paperwork to voluntarily withdraw will be administratively withdrawn from the University at the end of the term in which the student stopped attending . T he administra - tive withdrawal is posted to the student's transcript . Should the student wish to return to Rush in the future, the student will need to be readmitted . Voluntary Withdrawal Voluntary withdrawal refers to a permanent departure from the University that is student-initiated and without expectation of the student's return . After matriculation to Rush University, a student may not arbi- trarily cease registration . All students are required to maintain continuous enrollment or risk administrative withdrawal due to unexplained nonregistration . 39 Withdrawal implies the permanent departure from the University without the immediate expectation of return . Any student withdrawing from the University must give formal notification by completing a Petition for Withdrawal form, which requires the student to obtain specific signatures . T he Office of the Registrar is the designated office that a student must notify if he or she wishes to withdraw from the University . T he Petition for Withdrawal form may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar or online . T he date that the student begins the process of withdrawing will be the official date used in processing the form . No withdrawals are allowed during the final examination period . Withdrawal is also not allowed after the last class day of the term . Official withdraw al from the University entitles a student to a tuition refund from the first through the fifth weeks of the term . No other fees are refundable . T he Petition for Withdrawal form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by Friday at 4:30 p .m . (Central Time) to be considered valid for a particu - lar week's tuition refund . Leave of Absence After matriculation to Rush University, a student may not arbitrarily cease registration without notice . All students are required to maintain continuous enrollment or risk administra- tive withdrawal after one term due to unexplained nonregistra- tion . Leaves of absence (LOA) are approved and granted at the discretion of the student's college and are accepted only through the first week of the term for which the LOA is desired or as otherwise approved by the college . It is the student's responsibility to communicate directly with his or her college regarding the disposition of the request for the LOA . Students who request a LOA may be displaced into a subsequent cohort, required to take a revised program of study upon return to the University or be delayed in their progression through the program based on availability of courses and/or clinical placements . Students may be eligible for a LOA only after they have com-pleted and submitted the Petition for Leave of Absence required by each college or program to the Office of the Registrar . Failure to complete and submit the Petition for Leave of Absence form will make the student ineligible for any refunds and obligate him or her for the full term's insurance charges . T he date that the student begins the process of applying for a Leave of Absence is the official date that will be used in processing the form . A student who submits a Petition for Leave of Absence form after the fifth week of the term will receive grades in the courses for which he or she is registered and will be subject to an academic progression review based upon the assigned grades . Any decision reached by the student's academic program or college supersedes the submitted Petition for Leave of Absence form . Each degree has a time limit for completion that includes time away on a LOA . T he decision to include the LOA in calculat - ing the time limits for completion of the degree is within the discretion of each college . T he maximum length of time that will be approved for a single LOA is 12 consecutive months . Each college may have a maximum length of accumulated leave of absence . Students are responsible for registering themselves for the term in which they are returning from an approved LOA . T his registration must occur during the designated priority registra- tion period . Registration outside of this period will result in a late registration fee . It is the student's responsibility to consult with his or her advisor/program director regarding required courses for the term of re-entry . Rush Medical College students should consult with the appropriate Assistant Dean to deter - mine required courses . Students must satisfy the conditions of the LOA before re-entering and must comply with all policies, requirements and course sequences in effect at the time of re-entry . A request to extend a LOA requires that a new clearance form be submitted . A request to extend a LOA requires only the signatures of the student's program director, advisor or desig- nated administrator of the college . T he completed form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than the first Friday of the term for which the extension is being requested . Students who cannot return and who do not have an exten- sion of a LOA approved must withdraw from the institution . Students who fail to return from their LOA on the date that was originally approved risk administrative withdrawal . Student Records Name, Address and Phone Number Changes Rush University requires that student academic records exist under the student's legal name . The Office of the Registrar maintains the current official listing of student names and addresses for Rush University . It is each student's responsibility to keep the Office of the Registrar informed of changes to this information . Name changes require official documentation verifying the new name at the time of the request . Examples of official docu - mentation verifying a new name include valid driver's license, 40 marriage license (the official government document), passport, Social Security card, court order, or dissolution decree . Privacy and Confidentiality of Student Records and FERPA Rush University takes seriously its commitment to protect the privacy of its students and their education records . In addition to upholding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), Rush University has taken further steps to protect a person's privacy by extending similar benefits afforded to enrolled students under FERPA to individuals who are applying for admission . If a specific privacy/confidentiality question is not answered in this text, please contact the Office of the Registrar . Nothing in this policy may be construed to prohibit the University from disclosing information provided to the institu-tion under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act concerning sex offenders who are required to register . Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of students' educational records . Educational records include any information or documentation that is recorded in any way, including records produced by handwriting, computer, email, audio, video, etc . Educational records contain informa - tion directly related to a student, and are maintained by Rush University or any party acting on its behalf . FERPA protects the privacy of students' educational records by setting forth strict instructions and limitations governing the release of information about students . Although FERP A contains exceptions for the release of \"directory information\" without a student's prior written consent, students have the right to request that even such directory information be withheld from disclosure to third parties . Given the restrictions of FERPA, faculty and staff should assume that all students must provide written consent that follows the format specified in FERPA before any educational records may be released to anyone other than the student . Information cannot be released to any third party, including the students' parents, relatives, and friends . Particularly sensitive information includes students' Social Security numbers, race or ethnicity, gender, nationality, academic performance, disciplinary records, financial aid information, and grades . Privacy During the Admissions Process Rush University has chosen to take additional steps to protect a person's privacy by extending to individuals who are applying for admission similar benefits afforded to enrolled students . T his privacy protection covers all applicants and their application materials throughout the admissions process . T he application process exists between the applicant and a Rush University admissions office; therefore, any communication about can-didates and their application status to parties beyond these entities is not acceptable unless a school official has a legitimate educational interest to know this information in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities . All those involved in the admissions process (e .g ., admissions committee members, inter - viewers, admissions staff, etc .) must adhere to these guidelines . Directory Information Rush University may establish categories of information known as directory information and release this information without student consent, upon request . Rush University designates the following personally identifiable information contained in a student's educational record as directory information: Student's full name Address (local and permanent) Telephone number (local and permanent) Rush pager number (relevant to third- and fourth-year Rush Medical College students only) Rush email address Major and minor field(s) of study including the college, division, department and/or program in which the student is enrolled Student's classification (e .g ., junior, senior, etc .) or by number referring to such Dates of attendance and graduation, and degrees received Date and place of birth Photograph or other electronic images* Honors and awards received Previous colleges/universities attended Degrees earned at previous colleges/universities Rush Medical College postgraduate appointment (progr am/ institution/state) * Rush University records both visually and audibly many campus events and daily activities such as classes, commencement, convocations, student events, and other public occasions. These images, as well as other information about students, are published (e.g., print media; Rush website) regularly as part of the University's coverage of campus life and portrayal of the University to a variety of audiences. The University's policy is to restrict the use of any photograph/electronic image to the representation, marketing, or promotion of Rush activities only.41 Students may restrict the release of their directory informa- tion by completing and submitting the Directory Information Restrictions form available in the Office of the Registrar (or online) . The decision to restrict directory information will apply to all requests from third parties (other than those who have legal access to these data elements already), including prospec- tive employers . A student must formally rescind a restriction of directory information by submitting a subsequent Directory Information Restrictions form . Annual Notification of Student Rights under FERPA FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their edu- cational records . T hese rights include: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's educational records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. If an educational record contains information about other students as well, the requesting student may inspect and review only the specific informa - tion which pertains to him or her. Students should submit to the University Registrar, Dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect . The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected . If the records are not main - tained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed . The University may deny a request for copies of educational records when the requestor refuses to furnish proper identifi- cation and/or information required by the University . 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's edu - cational records that the student believes is inaccurate. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate . T hey should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, specify why it is inaccurate, and provide the accurate information . If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment . Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing . 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifi - able information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclo-sure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests . A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforce-ment unit personnel and health staff); a person or com-pany with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee (such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks) . A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility . 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Rush University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U .S . Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-5901 Commencement/Graduation Activities The Intent to Graduate form signals that a student is ready to graduate . By signing the Intent to Graduate form, the student is giving permission to the University to print the following infor - mation in any Rush graduation program and/or announce this information at any Rush graduation ceremony: the student's name as indicated on the Intent to Graduate form, any honors or awards received, the Rush degree and major the student is earning, previous colleges/universities attended, and degrees earned at those previous colleges/universities . If a Directory Information Restrictions form was previously sub-mitted, the student's signature on the Intent to Graduate form temporarily releases (for graduation ceremony/program pur - poses only) the directory information restrictions enacted by the student so that the information can be published in any Rush graduation program and/or announced at any Rush graduation ceremony . In addition, the student' s signature permits Rush University to release the student's name and address to the 42 external photography vendor with whom Rush contracts, and to have the vendor place graduation photographs of the student on its website . T he student's signature also allows the University to publish the student's picture in a picture composite and the student's image in a DVD of the Commencement ceremony that is created and distributed . T he recording of the graduation ceremony could also appear on the Rush University website and/or social media sites including but not limited to YouTube and Facebook . Finally, if the student is a medical student, the student's signature permits publication of the student's name, photograph, previous degrees earned, and other information in the Rush Medical College yearbook . If there are questions about how the information will used for graduation or commencement purposes, please speak with the Office of the Registrar before signing and submitting the Intent to Graduate form . Educational Records Rush University does not maintain educational records in one central office . Educational records are maintained in the Office of the Registrar and in the respective college and department offices . Other educational records are maintained in the Office of Student Financial Aid (financial aid information, student employment), Office of Student Financial Affairs (financial account payment information), Office of International Services, and other offices . Questions regarding individual student records should be directed to the appropriate location . Rush University will not issue copies of transcripts received from other institutions to anyone, including the student .Deceased Student Records Rush University may, upon the death of a student, release a student's educational records to a third party . T his is done at the sole discretion of Rush University .

T he Office of Financial Affairs will investigate the situation and will consult with other offices including the Office of the Registrar, the Office of Student Financial Aid and the student's program, as needed . A decision will be rendered within one month from the time the appeal was received and the student will be notified in writing . If the decision is not in the favor of the student, the student may file a written appeal with the Office of the Associate Provost for Student Affairs . T he decision of the Associate Provost for Student Affairs is final . Payment of Tuition and Fees The following statement represents the payment policy for all Rush University students: Charges can be viewed and payment for tuition, fees and on-campus housing can be completed through RUConnected, the University's online system . Payment can be made by credit card or e-check . If full payment of tuition cannot be made by the first week of class, as listed in the Academic Calendar, satisfactory arrangements for payment must be made with the Office of Financial Affairs . Students may not attend classes until after registration is complete . Any excep - tion to this policy must be approved in writing by the Associate Provost for Student Affairs . Students have the responsibility to complete one or a combina-tion of the following courses of action on or before the first Friday of classes each term: 1 . Pay total tuition, fees and on-campus housing charges for the term . 2 . Complete a Deferred Payment Plan Contr act . T his plan requires that the first payment and a $15 service charge be paid on or before the first Friday of the term . Additional pay - ments are due every four weeks . T he length of the contract is dependent on the length of the term . Contact the Office of Financial Affairs to set up a payment plan . 3 . Use the pending financial aid payment option . All students who have financial aid pending will be allowed to defer payment of that portion of tuition and fees that is covered by the anticipated aid . In order to use this option, students must have taken all steps required of them to apply for the aid (e .g ., the application for a guaranteed student loan program must have been completed and submitted to the Office of Student Financial Aid) . In order to avoid a late fee charge, students must make arrangements for payments of that portion of tuition and fees not covered with pending aid by completing steps one or two above . Failure to follow one of the steps above will result in a $100 late fee . Students who choose the deferred payment plan contract and who fail to make a payment by the specified due dates will result in a $50 late payment fee for each payment date missed . At the end of the academic term, those students who still have outstanding balances with Rush University that are not covered by pending financial aid will: Not receive transcripts/diplomas May be dismissed from on-campus housing Lose all university privileges Not be allowed to register for the following term Student Health Insurance Rush University requires students to be covered by a health plan in order to promote health and well-being while protecting the individual from undue financial hardship that a medical emer - gency could cause . Non-Rush Medical College students must provide proof of existing coverage before registering for the Fall term each year . Students who do not submit proof and receive confirmation of verification of their coverage will be enrolled in the student health insurance plan and charged for the premiums for the term . To that end, students enrolled in degree programs are eligible for the Student Health Insurance Plan offered by Academic HealthPlans, Inc . and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois . For the 2015-2016 school year, the cost of the plan is approxi - mately $3,086 .00 per academic year for single coverage . Additional coverages are available as follows: each child (addi - tional $3,086 .00 per year), and spouse (additional $3,086 .00 per year) . This plan allows students to choose a primary care physician from a large list of members of the Preferred Provider Plan (PPO) in the Greater Chicago area .

A small portion of fees for Rush Medical College students has been allocated to the Medical Student Health Service Program, supported by Lifetime Medical Associates (1645 W . Jackson, Suite 215) . The Medical Student Health Service Program is designed to work seamlessly with Rush University Health Insurance to provide medical students with acute care . By using Rush University Health Insurance, medical students should expe-rience an enhanced level of service and minimal billing prob- lems, with a $20 fee per office visit . T his will provide the type of Student Health Service with which most students are familiar . Additionally, all Rush Medical College students are covered under a blood and bodily fluids exposure rider . T his works as a supplemental policy to any health insurance to cover treatment or medications necessary as the result of a needle stick, splash or potentially contagious diseases exposure . T ogether with the basic Rush University Health Insurance policy, the rider will completely cover prophylactic medications or injections .

Monthly Rate (2015-2016 rates) Student Plan $21 .36 Student + One Plan $41 .86 Family Plan $79 .8546 Tuition Waivers Rush Medical College Students Enrolling in Courses Offered by the Graduate College Rush Medical College students who take a leave of absence from their MD program may enroll in Graduate College classes as part of a formal MS or PhD program, or simply for additional knowledge . Medical students are exempt (tuition waiver) from the additional tuition costs associated with enrollment in these classes . Doctoral Students in the Graduate College The Graduate College offers a full tuition scholarship for students enrolled in doctoral program in the basic sciences (Anatomy and Cell Biology, Biomechanics, Biochemistry, Immunology/Microbiology, Medical Physics, Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, Neuroscience and Pharmacology) . T he scholarship is only for tuition . Health insurance and other fees are the student' s responsibility . T o receive this scholarship, students must maintain full-time status . A requirement of at least 12 hours per quarter is needed to be a full-time student . If a student fails to register for 12 hours each quarter, the scholarship is rescinded and the student is billed tuition . In addition, most students accepted by the Graduate College receive a stipend . T he stipend awarded to a graduate student is a privilege and is contingent upon policies established by individual divisions . Master of Science Students in The Graduate College Students enrolled in master's programs in the basic sciences (Anatomy and Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Biomechanics, Biotechnology, Immunology/Microbiology, Medical Physics, Neuroscience and Pharmacology) pay tuition and fees . Master's students are generally not eligible for tuition scholarships and are expected to be enrolled full-time (12 hours per quarter) unless special arrangements have been made . Third-Party Billing If the student will not be personally paying his or her account, it is the student's responsibility to forward any bills to the appro- priate party as soon as possible . Office of Student Financial Aid Financial Aid Process Instructions for accessing financial aid information on the Rush University website are emailed to all newly accepted students prior to enrollment . T he Student Financial Aid website contains in-depth information on policies, procedures and financial aid awarding methodology . T he priority deadline for submission of financial aid application materials is March 1 for continuing students and new students starting in the fall . Students starting in a term other than fall should submit financial aid application materials at least two months prior to their start date . Students must be enrolled at least half-time and must be in a degree or approved certificate program to receive financial aid . T o receive assistance, all appropriate forms and materials must be on file . Students should expect to receive the majority of assistance in the form of loans . Because of limited institutional funding, finan - cial aid awards will likely contain loans that accrue interest while the student is in school . For students in the Medical College and nursing students in the Generalist Entry Master's (GEM) program, need-based grant assistance is available through the Office of Student Financial Aid . However, the funds are limited and all applicants (with few exceptions) must provide parental data and meet the institutional criteria for eligibility . Refer to the Office of Student Financial Aid website (http://www .rushu .rush .edu/ finaid/) for details . Undergraduate students who have not received a prior bach-elor's degree are more likely to receive grant assistance through federal and state need-based programs . Employment through the Federal Work-Study program may be possible throughout Rush University Medical Center . Depending on a student's academic program, Federal Work-Study assistance may be awarded as part of the financial aid package . It is the student's responsibility to secure employment . T he Office of Student Financial Aid assists students in locating jobs within the Medical Center . Financial Aid Determination Financial assistance programs at Rush University are provided to assist students who cannot otherwise afford to pay the full cost of education on their own . In general, financial need is the basic criterion for the awarding of funds . Accordingly , students and their families will be expected to contribute toward educational expenses to the fullest extent possible . T he level of the expected contribution is determined by using a standard set of criteria to analyze financial information provided by students and their families . Submission of parental data for institutional grants and loans is required for students in the Medical College and nursing students in the Generalist Entry Master's (GEM) program . Complete information about this policy is found on the Office of Student Financial Aid website . Student Financial Aid counselors are available to consult with students and parents (with the student's authorization) on all matters regarding the financing of a Rush University education . Students and authorized parents are welcomed and encouraged to make use of these services .47 Financial Aid Awards After evaluating student and family resources and assistance from outside the University, the Office of Student Financial Aid will award federal, state and institutional funds (as appropriate) to students with demonstrated financial need . In varying quanti - ties, a financial aid award may include grants, loans and student employment . In order to distribute the available funds in the most equitable manner, the Office of Student Financial Aid estab-lishes a formula that designates the sequence in which funds are awarded to students and the maximum amount awarded under each program . T he formula provides for a specific amount of loans and employment before students are considered for grants . These formulas are applied consistently during any given year among all students at a given class level and in a given college (pending availability of funds) . Due to differences in the availabil - ity of funds from year to year and changes in eligibility require- ments, the formulas are adjusted annually . Veterans Benefits Rush University participates in federal Veterans Education Benefits through the U .S . Department of V eterans Affairs (VA) . Post-9/11 GI Bill Provides tuition, fees, books/supplies and housing assistance to eligible veterans . T uition and fees are paid directly to Rush by the VA . Tuition and fees assistance is capped at the national maxi - mum of $21,084 .89 per academic year . Benefit rates v ary based on the veteran's circumstances . Some veterans may be able to transfer their benefits to a dependent . Yellow Ribbon Program Effective with the 2012-2013 academic year, certain colleges within Rush University participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program . Veterans entitled to the maximum benefit rate are eligible to apply for additional tuition and fees amounts if their costs exceed the $21,084 .89 cap . T he amount of additional assistance available and the number of students able to be supported is limited and varies by college . Funds will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis . Students who have received Y ellow Ribbon assistance will have preference for these funds in future academic years . Details are available on the VA's Yellow Ribbon Program information site . Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD Chapter 30) Monthly benefit paid directly to the veteran Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR Chapter 1606) Monthly benefit paid directly to the veteran Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP Chapter 1607) Monthly benefit paid directly to the veteran Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP Chapter 32) Monthly benefit paid directly to the veteran Survivors and Dependents Assistance (DEA Chapter 35) Monthly benefit paid directly to the survivor or dependent of the veteran If a student qualifies for participation in more than one Veterans Education Benefits program, the VA website provides a compari- son tool to help determine which benefits might be appropriate . Veterans interested in using their benefits at Rush for the first time should: 1 . Apply for benefits through the V A: If the veteran has never used veterans benefits at an institution before, this step must be completed . 2 . Submit form 22-1995 or form 22-5495 (as appropriate) online: If the veteran has used veterans education benefits before, but is a first-time benefits user at Rush University, the appropriate form must be submitted . 3 . Provide a copy of their eligibility letter from the V A (as well as any change of program forms from step 2, above) to the Office of Student Financial Aid before benefits can be certi- fied with the VA . All documents can be mailed, faxed or scanned and emailed to the Office of Student Financial Aid . Please be sure to indicate name and student ID number (or Social Security number) on all documents . Enrollment Status Definitions Students working toward a degree or certificate and who are enrolled at least half-time may be eligible for student financial assistance . These students may also be eligible to have their federal educational loans deferred . Students are considered full- time or half-time based on the below criteria . Full-time Half-time Medical Students All enrolled students are considered full-time Graduate Students 9 4 .5 PhD Dissertation Students 2 1 Undergraduate Students 12 648 Full-Time Registration for PhD Students A full-time PhD student is one who is matriculated and meets the conditions for each term noted below: Registers for nine or more graduate credit hours in an aca - demic term; or Registers for a minimum of two hours of dissertation course - work in a fall, spring, or summer term . Note: A student may register for additional courses as needed or required, but if registering for less than nine hours, this must include a minimum of two hours in dissertation hours to be considered full-time . A student must be registered for one of the above-defined statuses during fall, winter, spring or summer term sessions to maintain status as a full-time matriculated student . Individual graduate programs may set guidelines on research enrollments; including which academic milestones should be passed before enrolling in dissertation hours are permitted . Once students successfully defend their dissertation, no further research enroll-ments are necessary or allowable, and graduation should not be deferred . Each student will be allowed one term of enrollment to finalize all work related to the defense of their dissertation . During this term, the student should apply for graduation, and graduation should not be deferred beyond this point . Effective fall 2015, all dissertation courses will be corrected to be similarly named following university guidelines and hold fixed credit hours starting at a minimum of 2 .0, thereby always conferring full-time status . Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid about full- time status for financial aid purposes . Satisfactory Academic Progress The Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended by Congress mandates institutions of higher education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory progress for students receiving federal financial aid . These standards apply to all Federal Title IV aid programs including the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS Loan and Federal Work-Study programs . Accordingly, the Department of Education regulations require that Rush University's Office of Student Financial Aid monitor the academic progress of all financial aid recipients toward the completion of their degree . T his process is called Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) . This SAP policy is enforced in conjunction with all other institutional policies and procedures, including the academic progressions policies of Rush University's colleges and aca- demic programs . For undergr aduate and graduate students, the below criteria are checked at the end of each term . For medical students, the below criteria are checked annually at the end of spring term . Enforcement The Office of Student Financial Aid shall have primary responsi- bility in enforcing the SAP policy . T he Office of the Registrar and other Rush University offices that maintain student information relevant to the SAP policy shall provide such information, as requested by the Office of Student Financial Aid . SAP Requirements SAP requirements vary by academic level (undergraduate, graduate and medical students) . Please refer to the appropriate section to find the requirements that fit your academic program . UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for undergraduate students is monitored using three fac-tors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) . SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the credits it normally takes to complete the program . T he total allow - able attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush (excluding the general education courses required prior to entry in the program) by 1 .5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . For example , for a program that requires 107 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush (not including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program), a student may attempt up to 160 hours . Pace of Completion Students must successfully complete at least 67% of the courses they attempt . T his measure will be measured cumulatively over the course of the student's program . For the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable . Successful completion is defined as a grade of A, B or C for a letter grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass- fail or pass-no pass . T hese courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . Proficiency credit (\"K\" gr ades) is counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals .49 All other grades (including incomplete gr ades) are counted in the attempted hours total, but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete grade is later converted to a gr ade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalculated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses but who remain enrolled at the University will not have those dropped courses counted in the attempted hours total if they are dropped prior to the census date . Dropped courses after the census date will be counted in the attempted hours total . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . Transfer credits that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and completed hours . Students who change majors will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum cumula- tive GPA of 2 .0 . Students who have a term GPA of less than 1 .0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension . GRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for graduate students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) . SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted . Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the credits it normally takes to complete the program . T he total allow - able attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush by 1 .5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number . For example , for a program that requires 113 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush, a student may attempt up to 169 hours . Please note: nondegree certificate programs are approved by the U .S . Department of Education for financial assistance at a specific number of credit hours . Regardless of a student's actual plan of study, maximum time frame is calculated using the number of hours for which the program was approved with the U .S . Department of Education .Pace of Completion Students must successfully complete at least 67% of the courses they attempt . T his measure will be measured cumulatively over the course of the student's program . For the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable . Successful completion is defined as a grade of A or B for a letter grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass- fail or pass-no pass . T hese courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . Proficiency credit (\"K\" gr ades) is counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals . All other grades (including incomplete gr ades) are counted in the attempted hours total, but not in the completed hours total . If an incomplete grade is later converted to a gr ade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalculated . It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted . Students who drop courses but who remain enrolled at the University will not have those dropped courses counted in the attempted hours total if they are dropped prior to the census date . Dropped courses after the census date will be counted in the attempted hours total . Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts . Transfer credits that count toward the student's current aca - demic program count as both attempted and completed hours . Students who change majors will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program . Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) Graduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3 .0 . Students who have a term GPA of less than 2 .0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension . RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE STUDENTS SAP for Rush Medical College students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and grade requirements . SAP is measured at the end of each aca - demic year once final grades are in and at the time of awarding . Time Limits on Financial Aid Eligibility The normal time frame for completion of required coursework for the MD degree is four academic years . Due to academic or personal difficulties, a student may require additional time . 50 In such situations, the Rush Medical College Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) may establish a schedule for the student that departs from the norm and that may require repeating a year of study . For the purposes of this financial aid policy, no more than three years may be devoted to the first- and second-year curriculum . No more than three years may be devoted to the third- and fourth-year curriculum . Summer enrollment, if required, is considered part of the aca- demic year for the purposes of this measure . Approved Leaves of Absence do not count in this measure . Completion of Requirements/Pace of Completion 1 . First-year students must complete at least 66% of their first- year curriculum with a grade of \"Pass\" or better between the start of the year and the last day of spring quarter exams . This includes repeated courses . 2 . To advance to the second year, students must complete all first-year courses with a grade of \"Pass\" or better by the start of the second year . 3 . Second-year students must complete at least 66% of their second-year curriculum with a grade of \"Pass\" or better between the start of fall quarter and the last day of spring exams . This includes repeated courses . 4 . To advance to the third year, students must complete all second-year courses with a grade of \"Pass\" or better by the start of the Clinical Resources and Skills for the Hospital (CRASH) course . 5 . A student who is repeating/splitting the first or second year according to a COSEP schedule is considered to be making SAP . 6 . Third-year students must complete at least 66% of the clerkships they attempt with a grade of \"Pass\" or better . 7 . To advance to the fourth year, students must complete all core clerkships with a grade of \"Pass\" or better . 8 . A student who is repeating the third or fourth year accord - ing to a COSEP schedule is considered to be making SAP . Grade Requirements Academic progress in Rush Medical College is measured in terms of Honors, High Pass, Pass and Fail grades . A student must complete each required course/clerkship with a grade of \"Pass\" or better in order to graduate . A student who fails a course must retake it and earn a grade of at least \"Pass .\" A student who receives an Incomplete in a course must complete the course and earn at least a \"Pass .\" Financial Aid Warning Undergraduate and graduate students are allowed a finan- cial aid warning period . Professional students (Rush Medical College) are not allowed a financial aid warning period . Undergraduate or graduate students who fail to meet the requirements of this satisfactory academic progress policy will be placed on financial aid warning for one additional term (with the exception of undergraduate students who have a first- term GPA of less than 1 .0 and graduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 2 .0; in this case, that student would immediately be placed on financial aid suspension) . Students will be allowed to continue on financial assistance during the warning period . Students placed on financial aid warning will be sent notification by hard-copy letter (through the U .S . Postal Service) and through their Rush email account . T he notification will include SAP requirements, steps necessary to meet SAP in the upcoming term and the consequences for failing to meet SAP requirements by the end of the warning period . Students will be placed on financial aid suspension if they fail to meet the standards of this SAP policy after the one-term financial aid warning period . Suspension of Financial Aid Eligibility Professional students (Rush Medical College) who fail to meet the requirements of this SAP policy will be placed on financial aid suspension . Undergraduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 1 .0 and graduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 2 .0 will be placed on financial aid suspension . Students who still fail to meet the requirements of this policy after their single term on financial aid warning will be placed on financial aid suspension . Students who are suspended from financial aid eligibility will be notified by hard-copy letter (through the U .S . Postal Service) and through their Rush email account . Appealing Suspension of Financial Aid Eligibility A student may appeal the suspension of financial aid eligibility for extenuating circumstances . Appeals from other parties on behalf of the student will not be accepted . All appeals should be submitted to the Director of Student Financial Aid in writing . Each appeal must include: 1) the reasons why the standards of this policy were not met, 2) what has changed in the student's situation that will allow the student to make satisfactory prog-ress during the next evaluation, and 3) an academic plan for the remainder of the student's studies .

All appeals must be submitted within 10 business days of receipt of a suspension notice. The Director of Student Financial Aid will review the appeal and will respond to the student within 10 business days from the receipt of the appeal . Students whose appeals are approved will be placed on a financial aid probationary period for one term or for the duration of an academic plan devel- oped by the student's advisor, as appropriate . T he probationary period will be defined to include checkpoints that must be achieved in order for the student to remain eligible for finan- cial assistance . Students failing to abide by the terms of their probationary period will be suspended from financial aid after their probationary period . The decision of the Director of Student Financial Aid is final, binding and not subject to further appeal . Reinstatement of Financial Aid Eligibility A student's eligibility for financial aid will be reinstated at such time as the student successfully meets the standards of the SAP policy . It is the student's responsibility to present evidence to the Student Financial Aid Office at the time the student meets the requirements for reinstatement . LEAP Benefits All full-time employees (72 to 80 hours per pay period) can receive prepayment up to nine credit hours per term . Part- time employees (40 to 70 hours per pay period) can receive prepayment up to six credit hours per term .

Please let us know if we can help you in any way . Thomas A . Deutsch, MD Henry P . Russe, MD, Dean of Rush Medical College 56 Rush Medical College: Mission The mission of Rush Medical College is to deliver outstand- ing medical education focused on patient care, research and community service . Our diverse students learn in a practitioner - teacher model, which promotes collaboration, accountability and respect . We graduate physicians who are dedicated to the pursuit of excellence in clinical practice, research and service through continuous learning . Rush Medical College: Terminal Objectives The Rush Medical College terminal objectives are key learning objectives that students achieve by the time of graduation from the medical college program . Terminal objectives illustrate Rush Medical College's commit-ment to our students, and are written as outcome statements of competencies deemed critical to a successful physician . T he terminal objectives direct all curriculum and assessment, as all course and session objectives ultimately serve the terminal objectives . The terminal objectives are grouped under six domains which parallel those used by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) . T he domains and terminal objec - tives include: 1. Patient Care In their patient care, students must: Complete comprehensive evaluations of patients Develop appropriate treatment plans Apply the principles of health promotion 2. Medical Knowledge Students must: Demonstrate knowledge of the basic, clinical and social sciences related to medical practice Apply the knowledge of basic, clinical and social sciences to patient care 3. Interpersonal and Communication Skills Students must: Communicate and collaborate effectively with patients , families and other health care providers Function as a member of the health care team 4. Putting Care in a Practical Context Students must: Be respectful of the diversity of patient backgrounds, beliefs and values Analyze the environmental and contextual factors that influence a patient's health, disease and access to health care Engage the resources of the health care system to enhance patient care 5. Self-Directed and Lifelong Learning Students must: Address personal learning needs Appraise scientific evidence that supports patient care practices 6. Professionalism Students must: Display compassion and empathy when interacting with patients and their families Adhere to the professional responsibilities outlined by Rush Medical College Demonstrate the professional values of medical practice The terminal objectives are supported by year-specific objectives so that course work in each year of the curriculum builds upon skills, knowledge, and attitudes needed to achieve the terminal objectives . A review of the terminal objectives can help students gauge their progress in the curriculum, and potentially guide elective selection when the time comes . Rush Medical College: Admissions Process Applying to Rush Medical College Rush Medical College utilizes the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), for its primary application . Detailed information and application materials are available on the Association of American Medical Colleges website (https:// www .aamc .org/students/applying/amcas/) . Each applicant who submits an AMCAS application to Rush Medical College will receive a secondary application invitation by email . T he second - ary application requires a nonrefundable fee of $100 .00 and must be submitted in its entirety no later than December 31 . Required Criminal Background Check As a medical school located in Illinois, Rush Medical College will enforce the Medical School Matriculant Criminal History Records Check Act, which states: a medical school located in Illinois must require that each matriculant submit to a fingerprint-based criminal history records check for violent felony convictions and any adjudication of the matriculant as a sex offender conducted by the Department of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of the medical school admissions process . 57 Each year beginning January 1, an applicant screening provider will procure a background check on applicants at the point of their first acceptance . Upon completion of this process, the report procured during the process will be released to Rush Medical College . Required Drug Screening In preparation for clinical rotations at John H . Stroger, Jr . Hospital of Cook County, all Rush Medical College students are required to submit a urine sample under conditions arranged by Rush Medical College for a drug screening (effective with the first year class entering in 2015) . First-year students will be tested during orientation through a process coordinated by the Student Health Service (Lifetime Medical Associates) . Upon completion of the testing process, a report will be released to Rush Medical College . A positive result from the Criminal Background Check, the Sex Offender Assessment, and/or the Drug Screen will result in the applicant's file being presented to the Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) for review and action . If the COSEP verifies there is a positive result on the Criminal Background Check, the Sex Offender Assessment, and/or the Drug Screen, Rush Medical College may rescind the student's acceptance . For additional information, visit the Rush Medical College Admissions website (http://www .rushu .rush .edu) . Rush Medical College: Diversity and Inclusion Statement Rush Medical College embraces the Rush University Medical Center Diversity Leadership Council vision for diversity and the American Association of Medical Colleges' commitment to increasing diversity in medical schools . Recognizing that diversity and inclusion enhance the medical education environment and ultimately the overall health of our community, Rush Medical College seeks to create and support an environment in which faculty, staff, and medical students combine their differing back-grounds, diverse perspectives, and unique skills as they work with peers to solve problems, enhance their ability to work with patients, and develop new, effective ways to manage health, conduct research, and deliver care . Rush Medical College strives to enroll a highly qualified and richly diverse student body through holistic review and indi-vidual consideration of the potential contributions that appli-cants with different backgrounds, cultures, perspectives, races, ethnicities, characteristics, and personal experiences would make to the educational experience of all students and to the school's cultural, social, and learning environment . Rush Medical College seeks to attain a learning environment that better reflects its community through increased representation of groups that are underrepresented in medicine in Rush Medical College's surrounding communities . Along with remaining committed to applicants from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in medicine, Rush Medical College considers diversity in economic, geographic, gender, age, sexual orientation, racial and ethnic backgrounds as important factors in not only creating a diverse community but also influencing an applicant's potential to suc- ceed as a physician in our rapidly changing and diverse society . To this end, the Rush Medical College Committee on Admissions annually identifies factors for consideration in building a diverse student body . Further, Rush Medical College's Faculty Council, utilizing information provided by the Committee on Admissions and other data, is committed to implementing programs and initiatives designe Technical (Non-academic) Standards for Admission and Promotion Reviewed by Committee on Admissions, 2012 Reviewed by Legal Affairs, 2012Reviewed and Approved by the COSEP, May 2, 2012Final Document Reviewed by Committee on Admissions, May 9, 2012 The following technical guidelines have been adopted by Rush Medical College Committee on Admissions .

International Students Students from other countries are welcome to apply . Limited finan - cial aid is available . T OEFL is required for applicants who are non- native speakers of English . T his requirement may be waived if the applicant has completed a minimum of three years of higher educa- tion and received a baccalaureate degree in the United States . Student Progression in the College of Nursing Student progress in the College of Nursing is reviewed and evalu- ated in several ways . T he progressions policies established by the faculty are interpreted and applied by the student's academic advisor, the Office of Academic Affairs, and the College of Nursing Progressions Committee . T he faculty reserves the right to request the withdrawal of any student whose conduct, physical or mental health, or performance demonstrates lack of fitness for continu- ance in a health profession . Should a student's behavior come into 71 question, policies and procedures to determine the student's continuing status in the college are delineated in the College of Nursing Student Handbook . Since much of the work in nursing assumes that students will achieve a progressively higher level of understanding and skill, high academic performance is expected . T he individual student is responsible for acquiring knowledge inside and outside of formal classroom and clinical settings . Academic Progressions Policy A student must achieve an \"A\" or \"B\" grade in all required clini- cal nursing courses . If a \"C\" grade is achieved in a single clinical seminar course or a single clinical practicum, the student must repeat the course prior to graduation . A student may repeat only one clinical seminar or clinical practicum in a program of study . A grade of \"F ,\" \"N,\" \"WF\" or \"WN\" or a second \"C\" in a required clinical seminar or clinical practicum may result in dis- missal from the program . An \"F ,\" \"N,\" \"WF\" or \"WN\" grade in any required course places the student on academic probation and may result in dismissal from the program . Permission may be given to retake a course at the discretion of the Progressions Committee . If permitted, a student has only one opportunity to achieve a passing grade . An \"F ,\" \"N,\" \"WF\" or \"WN\" grade in the repeated courses may result in dismissal . Students in all graduate programs must maintain a cumula- tive 3 .0 average in graduate coursework to remain in good academic standing . If a student's cumulative GP A drops below 3 .0, the student will be placed on academic probation . A student may enroll for no more than two consecutive terms as a probationary student . Students may be dismissed from the college upon failing to achieve satisfactory academic standing in the required period of time or if the student incurs a second probationary event . To be awarded a degree or certificate, a student must be in good academic standing at the completion of the program .

Student Professional and Community Service Requirement Participation in service activities is an important attribute of the health science professional . A hallmark of outstanding Rush students and alumni is the desire and ability to make meaningful service contributions . Community service activities may include volunteer activities (health fairs and clinics, health education, provision of health services to at risk or disadvan-taged populations and other outreach education or clinical activities) and service on community boards, committees, work groups and other service activities that promote the health and well-being of the community and its members . Professional ser - vice may include participation in the provision of state, national or international activities to advance the quality, access and effectiveness of health care services provided by allied health professionals . Achievement of the College of Health Sciences Excellence in Service Goal is demonstrated in part through: 1 . Student and faculty participation in community service activities 2 . Student satisfaction with and appreciation for community service 3 . Students and faculty who provide leadership and support to professional associations, boards and committees 4 . Provision of community and professional continuing education to local, national and international audiences In order to support achievement of the College's service excel-lence goals and objectives, the College has developed a profes-sional and community service requirement for all College of Health Sciences students as a part of their academic programs . As a requirement for program completion, each academic degree granting program will establish a minimum service requirement for each student enrolled in the program of at least 16 contact hours of approved professional or community service . Examples of activities that may be used to meet this require-ment include participation in community health fairs; community health screening and/or health services; provision of community health education; participation in approved professional service and/or continuing education activities; and assistance with the delivery of seminars, lectures, workshops and related community or professional continuing education activities . This program requirement will be required for satisfactory course completion for at least one course in the student's prescribed course of studies . As an alternative , the requirement may be listed as a graduation requirement for the program in the cata- log and program handbook . Conduct and Ethics Each student is expected to conduct himself or herself in a pro-fessional manner at all times\u2014in a manner which conforms to the ethics of the health professions and which instills confidence in the student's abilities as a health care professional . Each stu - dent is expected to conform to the professional code of ethics as outlined in his or her departmental student handbook . Irresponsible, unprofessional or unethical behavior may result in disciplinary action, which may include suspension or dismissal from the college . All clinical agency or hospital regulations are to be followed by students when undergoing clinical or other training in a facility . For additional information, students should refer to the Rush University Statement on Academic Honesty and Student Conduct and the Rush University Medical Center Code of Conduct .

Additionally , the sharing of personal experiences can be a rich resource in the development of students' understanding, knowledge and appre- ciation of disease, health care and impact on peoples' lives . Practicing the medical history and physical examination of patients places students in close contact and leads to the sharing of personal information and physical findings . Similarly students may use personal experiences in patient role-playing exercises . All shared and personal medical information and physical examination findings are to be treated with utmost confiden- tiality, the same as for any patient contact . Failure to protect the confidentiality of any information related to the activities in a course or clinical rotation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including suspension or dismissal from the college .

Students in both programs are required to complete 16 hours of community or professional service during the program . Students meet this requirement in a variety of ways including assisting at health fairs; volunteering at the local food pantry; and assisting at local, state and national professional associa- tion meetings .Communication Disorders and Sciences: Philosophy The underlying basis for the graduate degree programs in audiol- ogy and speech-language pathology is the practitioner-teacher model, whereby students learn from faculty who take on dual roles as academicians and practitioners . T his approach to profes - sional education helps to bridge the gap that can exist between classroom teaching and clinical service delivery . Students learn in an environment where teaching, research, and patient care are wholly integrated . T he faculty at Rush participate fully in the clini - cal process in addition to teaching and research . Students receive outstanding clinical education experiences with diverse patients who present a full range of communicative disorders . T he audiol - ogy and speech-language pathology programs are accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation of the American Speech- Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) . The programs in audiology and speech-language pathology are based on the philosophy that professional education is optimized by drawing upon the patients, staff, and other resources of an academic medical center . T he resources at Rush University enrich and enhance faculty and student research and scholarship, and they provide unique opportunities for interprofessional educa- tion and collaborations . T he clinical skills of Rush students are fostered and developed through didactic courses, clinical observa- tion and instruction, and supervision by practitioner-teachers . T he department faculty is supplemented by the expertise of physicians, scientists, and other health care practitioners within the medical center . The goals of the academic programs in audiology and speech-language pathology are to generate and disseminate new knowl-edge in the communication disorders and sciences and to prepare graduates who: Synthesize contemporary knowledge of speech and hearing science and apply it in the assessment and management of a broad spectrum of communication disorders Implement evidence-based protocols for the evaluation and treatment of individuals with communication disorders Utilize and contribute to new knowledge in the professions and discipline Function as professional-level speech-language pathologists or audiologists in health care and other settings Are eligible for clinical certification from the American-Speech- Language-Hearing Association Are eligible for state licensure within the profession 124 Mission Statement of the Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences The Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences at Rush University Medical Center integrates outstanding gradu-ate education, superior patient care, excellence in research and scholarship, and service to diverse communities .

T he committee meets regularly to review the progress of the residents and the operation of the program . All clinical tr aining takes place in the Department of Radiation Oncology . T he Office of Graduate Medical Education (GME) monitors and reviews the quality of the program and provides oversight to assure its adherence to the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs (CAMPEP) standards .177 Occupational Therapy: Mission and Philosophy The Department of Occupational Therapy at Rush University Medical Center and Rush University is committed to teach, investigate, and provide the very best quality health care . T he department is grounded in the practitioner-teacher-investigator model with an emphasis on leadership and relationships with professional and societal communities . T he Department pro - motes excellence in addressing diversity in health care . Occupational therapists recognize humans as persons engaged in and organized around occupations . When dysfunction pre - vents doing, occupational therapists enable doing in a variety of ways . The practice of occupational therapy involves individuals, their attributes, and the multiple environmental components that surround the performance of occupations . Occupational therapy interventions are directed at these variables to amelio- rate and enable occupational performance . The faculty members are practitioners-teachers and researchers, a combination that infuses the curriculum with a contemporary and scholarly perspective . Graduate courses are designed to build on past knowledge and experience as well as encourage transformative learning . T he critical self-reflection of the trans - formative learning process encourages the examining, question-ing, validating and possible revision of prior knowledge so that new perceptions and meanings may be constructed . It results in the learner being able to wholly and freely participate in critical dialogue and the resulting action, thus empowering the learner (Cranston, 1994) . By basing the program on tr ansformative learning, it is possible to build on the students' past, connect it to their activities of the present, and predict a future in which they are competent and capable to respond to the needs of the profession . These learning experiences, occurring within and outside the classroom, promote independence in conjunction with faculty mentorship, problem solving, and critical thinking . Because of the graduate's experience in self-directed learning, he or she is able to be responsible and responsive to the needs of the increasingly dynamic profession . T he graduate is a potential learner in the field who is able to work in the traditional and diverse occupational therapy settings, but more importantly, the graduate is flexible, autonomous, and informed so as to adapt to the changing demands of practice . Occupational Therapy: Program Overview Professional Description The Department of Occupational Therapy offers a graduate program that prepares the student for unique contributions to the field of occupational therapy . T his professional level program is designed for individuals with baccalaureate degrees in other fields who are seeking to become occupational therapists . Educational Orientation The professional graduate program at Rush University is designed for the student who has acquired a variety of life experiences through previous educational, vocational and avo- cational activities . T he program values the incorporation of these life experiences into the educational activities of the program . The educational approach utilized in the program that best addresses these spheres is based on theories of adult learning . By basing the program on adult learning theories, it is possible to build on the students' past, connect it to their activities of the present and predict a future of competent, capable responses to the needs of the profession . T he program is designed to enable the student to learn not only the content and theories of occu-pational therapy, but also the process of utilizing the multiple resources of the learning environment, including teachers and peers . A series of carefully designed learning experiences, occur - ring within and outside the classroom, promote independence in conjunction with collegial interaction, problem solving and clinical reasoning, and analysis and synthesis of information . T he graduate emerges as a competent therapist who has main-tained initial curiosity and added to it through increased ability for creative thinking . Because of experiences in self-directed learning and self-identification of needs, the graduate is able to be responsible and responsive to the needs of the profession . The graduate is expected to be a life-long learner capable of maintaining professional integrity when faced with challenges and complexities of contemporary health care . Professional Orientation Since the Rush graduates will be prepared to work in a variety of traditional and nontraditional settings, their practice base is the result of broad experiences within the many arenas of occupational therapy . T he graduates have the ability to add increasing amounts of depth and validation to their treatment programs as a result of their involvement and experiences with problem-solving approaches to therapy . Given the combination of breadth and depth of knowledge and experience related to occupational therapy treatment, the primary strength of Rush University graduates will be their ability to function as highly resourceful practitioners . As in the past, and for the foreseeable 178 future, the role of the practitioner is the core of all occupational therapy . The practitioner who is able to base treatment on established fact, use internal and external resources, and engage in clinical reasoning and problem solving is the practitioner who will contribute to the credibility and viability of the profession . It is this type of practitioner who is expected to be the product of the Rush program . The graduates of the program are able to enter the clinical arena competently and confidently, applying their clinical skills and expanding upon those skills as individual situations require . T his continuous process of assessment and expansion contributes to the personal and professional growth vital to occupational therapists . The role of the clinician, as it is understood in this context, incorporates other major roles of the therapist . As the Rush program is designed, the students have the oppor - tunity to explore the functions of the therapist as an educator, researcher and manager from the practitioner's perspective . The involvement of the student in these other roles is another major strength of the program . T he additional roles of educator, manager and researcher cannot be separated from the practitio- ner's role .

In addition to learning the management skills, this experience also provides an understanding of how principal investigators design and perform research and provides first- hand experience in study preparation and compliance issues . These experiences enable our graduates to identify areas where research administration practices can be modified to better enable the research community . Practicum The overall aim of practicum courses is to introduce students to the roles and responsibilities in the following research administrative offices: sponsored projects, clinical trials manage-ment, research finance, research compliance, research integrity, 190 departmental grant administration and intellectual property and technology transfer . In the first practicum, a student does a project in three of the above areas . Although a project is in a specified area, each project will involve learning skills and proto- cols that are applicable to multiple areas of research administra- tion . Students are encouraged to select areas that are new to them . Students with experience in multiple areas may focus on completing a single project . T he second practicum course is a way to gain experience in a specialized area . Because many of the students already have research administration experience, practicums are not required and electives may be taken in their place . If you are a distance student who wishes to do a practicum, we will work with you to identify a practicum site either at your place of employment or near your home . W e will work together to secure the necessary agreements with the site you identify and assure that the practicum meets the standards of our program . Due to varying state regulations , practicums may not be available to students in some states . In this case, we cannot offer a practicum . However, elective courses are available to all students in lieu of the practicums . The Profession The profession of research administration is an integral part of administration at universities and research institutes . T he practice of the profession includes obtaining and overseeing external dollars for the institution, helping institutions comply with federal and nonfederal sponsor regulation, and develop-ing partnerships and collaborative ventures with other research organizations . Research administrators represent their institu - tions in diverse matters related to grants and contracts as well as maintain the policies and procedures of their institution . T he research administrator serves the faculty, the institution and the sponsoring agencies through an effective management system . The sponsored research community often needs an advocate who will work toward improving and stimulating the institu- tional climate for these activities . As such, research administra - tors are often challenged to articulate the value of sponsored activity in an environment where it has not traditionally been emphasized . Research administrators also tak e on the role of policy developer when institutional policies and procedures may need adjustment to comply with sponsor requirements . At some institutions research administrators assume the role of facilitating the development of a climate more conducive to the research enterprise without compromising the teaching and public service missions of the institution .The Program The program will require a minimum of 46 quarter credit hours (13 courses) of academic coursework taken at the gradu- ate level . All didactic courses will be completed using the Rush University learning management system (RULearning) for web-based instruction . T he program may be completed in approximately 12 to 18 months of full-time enrollment or taken on a part-time basis over a longer period . Students who desire to complete additional elective courses offered either at Rush University or at another regionally accredited college or univer - sity may request to do so, and these electives may be incorpo-rated into the student's program plan with the permission of the student's academic advisor . The objectives of the program are to: Prepare competent advanced-level research administr ators for practice Prepare leaders who are able to plan, develop and deliver high-quality, cost-effective research administration services Provide training in specific research administration areas Develop individuals who can formulate appropriate ques - tions, organize and test hypotheses and apply research results to the practice of research administration Research Administration: Admission Requirements General Education Requirements Prospective students must have a bachelor's degree or the equivalent from a U .S .-accredited college or university .

Program Prerequisites All program prerequisite courses must be taken prior to entry into the first year of the regular professional program (alterations in the student's planned program require written approval by the department chair/program director) . Registration for the first sequence of professional courses in the program requires: Admission into the program Completion of Human Anatomy and Physiology , Chemistry, Physics, Microbiology, Psychology, Computer Science and Statistics with a grade of \"C\" or better Consent of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care Please note: Individuals holding the RRT credential may be admitted to the program prior to completion of all program prerequisites . Respiratory Care: Registered Respiratory Therapist Advanced Standing (RRT) Admissions Requirements \u2014 BS or MS Program Individuals holding the RRT credential may apply to enter the Respiratory Care Program prior to any quarter . Submission of an application for admission should be made to the Office of College Admission Services with all official transcripts, National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) RRT certificate and a personal interview at least 30 days prior to the first day of the quarter in which the individual desires to begin classes . General education and profes - sional prerequisites must be completed prior to graduation . All other program policies and procedures apply . Introduction Individuals may have acquired academic credit in respiratory care courses from other schools and universities . Some individuals may acquire knowledge through experience and on-the-job training . When such persons apply for admission into the program, an attempt is made to grant academic credit for equivalent educa-tional courses, equivalent knowledge acquired from experience and/or successful completion of the NBRC's certification and registry examinations . All students graduating from the Respiratory Care Program must meet the same standards for graduation; the awarding of advanced standing does not signify a lesser-quality education than that offered through regular coursework . What it does , however, is attempt to exempt the student from those areas of the formal program where the student already has the knowledge and expertise in those skills that would be offered . T he program has identified the minimum competencies that a respiratory therapist must have in order to provide safe, high-quality patient care . The identification of these competencies is a complex task, and a great deal of care must be taken to ensure a standard of excellence . The following policies and procedures are designed to ensure that those individuals who receive advanced standing are qualified to do so, and that the screening process adheres to University as well as departmental policies at all times . To allow individuals who are not qualified to receive advanced standing is not in the student's or the program's best interest . 195 Definition Advanced standing is defined as a special and individually deter - mined status granted to a student in a formal educational set- ting who has already gained, through other sources or through nonacademic experiences, knowledge, skills and professional attitudes taught in the program courses . Purpose of Advanced Standing Procedures The purpose of the advanced standing procedures is to recog-nize and give formal educational credit for knowledge and/or ability gained through previous training or experience . Methods of Granting Advanced Standing Advanced standing can be awarded through transfer credit . Advanced standing can be awarded through the passing of an equivalency examination covering a certain area of knowledge . (An equivalency examination is an instrument or means by which a student accepted into the Respiratory Care Program can demonstrate mastery of a knowledge area, content area or skill and thus be exempted from a course in the program which teaches that area or skill .) Advanced standing can be awarded as credit for successful completion of national certification (CRT/CPFT) or registry examinations (RRT/RPFT) . Eligibility for Advanced Standing Transfer students (who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program) may receive transfer credit for equivalent courses within the Respiratory Care Program curriculum . Credentialed students (RRT , CRT, CPFT, RPFT) who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program may receive transfer credit and will also be eligible to take equivalency examinations in certain courses . Policy for Transfer Students Students who have completed coursework at other approved respiratory care programs may petition to have these courses transfer in lieu of specific coursework in the Rush University program . Students must submit a transcript of their courses from the program and a copy of the course syllabus for each course in which they desire transfer credit . T he syllabus must contain the following: course objectives, lecture outlines, course content, evaluation procedures and related information . T hese courses will be evaluated on an individual basis for content and total contact hours and credit hours . The department reserves the right to test the proficiency of any student in coursework transferred from other respiratory care programs and the right to disallow transfer credit for such course-work in cases in which the student cannot demonstrate acceptable proficiency . All transfer credit is subject to the approval of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care . T he student must also have a minimum grade of \"C\" (2 .0) for each course being transferred . A student cannot receive tr ansfer credit for any respiratory care coursework if he or she left the previous program due to academic probation, suspension or exclusion . All University policies regarding transfer credit must be satisfied . Policy for Individuals Who Hold the CRT or RRT Credential Advanced standing is available to individuals who have success- fully completed the National Board for Respiratory Care's respira-tory therapy certification (CRT) or respiratory therapy registry (RRT) examinations . T hose eligible for advanced standing must submit the following documentation: A notarized copy of the CRT or RR T certificate indicating that it is a true and accurate copy Official transcripts of all previous respiratory care and general education coursework attempted and/or completed A notarized copy of the Certificate of Completion from an approved respiratory care training program as applicable A completed application for admission to the program with advanced standing .

Students are engaged in highly individualized programs to maximize opportunities for self-realization and the faculties' opportunities for sharing their scholarly develop- ment, expertise and experiences on a personal basis . While still committed to this goal, the Graduate College is also respond-ing to concerns communicated by the National Institutes of Health regarding optimal biomedical workforce preparation . T o address issues with the pace of innovation and the realities of the rapidly evolving workplace, we have recently completed a comprehensive re engineering of our laboratory-based doctoral curriculum . In this process, we have placed a deeper emphasis on presenting course material from an integrated conceptual framework so that students are better prepared to manage the rapidly expanding body of complex biomedical information . Our curriculum moves from a disciplinary perspective to a more sys- tematic, interdisciplinary orientation . T hus, all laboratory-based graduate students will now jointly participate in a common, integrated first year curriculum exploring the shared foundations of biomedical sciences . T his approach leverages the signifi - cant interaction of students with interests across the spectrum of biomedical sciences and provides a common knowledge base to allow students to move more fluidly into the team- based research phase of their specific doctoral programs . T his Integrated Biomedical Sciences curriculum also creates a more inclusive and welcoming feeling among students to encourage group learning and problem solving . The new Integrated Biomedical Sciences master's program starts with a shared first year course plan, but in the second year, the five-year doctoral program provides flexibility for students to personalize their research activities in any of five areas of shared disease or system focus . The Graduate College also includes other specialized master's programs for laboratory-based research or clinical science research as well as in biotechnology . T hese course offerings address the expanding need for clinical scientists and highly trained technical staff, respectively, to advance science in the 21st century . This program preserves the Rush organizational pattern, including a high degree of individualized faculty and student interaction in the educational processes of the college consistent with the teacher-practitioner model . Students find the open, collaborative environment across the college with a shared focus on translational research to constitute a highly distinct educational environment . The Graduate College: Organization To facilitate its educational mission, the laboratory-based research PhD program, called the Integrated Biomedical Research program, is organized into five tracks that represent interdisciplinary areas of research excellence at Rush that are also highly aligned with areas of clinical strength . T his align - ment forms a fertile nexus for sustained, innovative translational collaboration . T hese interactions typically involve fluid interac - tions of relevant scientists, clinicians and other professionals working in flexible team structures . T his new organizational approach builds on the strong legacy of the Graduate College but is redesigned to create a more stimulating learning environ- ment for the students . T his entails moving from the traditional discipline-focused curriculum to a more integrated, systems biol-ogy approach embracing multidisciplinary team-based science 214 required for greater success in addressing existing complex biomedical challenges . T he learning environment in the new pro - gram format will enhance student-to-student interaction as they are immersed into the Rush research environment . All students participate in an integrated shared curriculum and then choose to conduct their doctoral/ thesis research in one of five interdis-ciplinary tracks related to areas of excellence in clinical care at Rush . At the same time, we have broadened the array of faculty representing a wider range of disciplines from basic to clinical to community working together to address critical biomedical problems in the five track areas . The five educational/research tracks of the college are as follows: Cardiovascular and Respiratory Biology Function and Disorders of the Musculoskeletal System Function and Disorders of the Nervous System Infection, Immunity and Inflammation Research Translational Cancer Research The primary goal of each track is to provide excellent graduate education in the sciences, from basic to medicine . T he tracks of the college are flexible and responsive to the changing needs and experiences in their disciplines . T his approach is highly aligned with our shared vision: The Rush learning community will be the leading health sciences university committed to transforming health care through innovative research and education . The educational process for the first year integrated curriculum is coordinated by an associate program director who works to ensure that the integrated first year curriculum is delivered in a fashion that supports student mastery in approaching complex biomedical problem solving . T he overall program director is responsible for the learning environment for the remainder of the dissertation years and is charged with achieving full programmatic integration including learning assessment as well as timely student progression . Each track leader inter acts with the other track leaders and the Integrated Biomedical Sciences directors through the Educational Committee to ensure smooth functioning of this program . The Graduate College Council is the senior representative body of the college . Its membership includes all track directors and program directors including the directors of the biotechnology and clinical research programs, as well as an elected faculty member from each of the tracks and three students from dif- ferent divisions (elected by the students annually) . Only the elected members and students are allowed to vote . T he Dean or his or her designee serves as the chair of the council . T he council is responsible for setting policies for the admission of students; the formulation and adoption of general operating policies, standards and procedures of the college; the appoint-ment of the Graduate College faculty; and the approval of those recommended for degrees . Although the Dean and the Council maintain significant oversight of programs in the Graduate College, the tracks also establish policies and procedures for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences program, consistent with the policies and procedures of the college and the University . The Graduate College Council periodically reviews all divisional policies and procedures . The faculty of the Graduate College is drawn from the faculty of the other colleges of Rush University, who hold the same rank in the Graduate College as in their primary colleges . No faculty member has a primary appointment in the Graduate College . Additional Graduate College Programs Beyond the Integrated Biomedical Sciences programs, the Graduate College oversees two additional programs . T hese programs are Master of Science in Clinical Research Biotechnology These programs are administered out of the Dean's office, and both are overseen by the Graduate College Council . Faculty members from several divisions participate in the education of students in these programs . The Graduate College: Admission Requirements The faculty of the Graduate College encourages diversity among the student population and therefore seeks to admit persons from various backgrounds . T he Graduate College uses the following guidelines to evaluate candidates for admission . Individual divisions within the college may have additional requirements and criteria for admission . Applicants are encour - aged to first check with the division of interest . T he college's requirements are as follows: Deadline for applications: Priority deadline is May 1 for all research two-year MS and basic sciences PhD students; how- ever, all F-1 visa holders are encouraged to apply by March 15 . For all other programs, application must be completed by July 1 and all supporting documents must be received by August 1 . (Some programs may have earlier deadlines . Please check with the individual program director early in the application process .)215 Applications to the Graduate College are reviewed considering all parts of the application when determining admission .

Acceptance of transfer credit: Petition for transfer of graduate credit is consistent with University policy . Graduate level transfer credit is subject to the approval of the faculty advisor, program director or designated college administrator based on an evaluation of quality and equivalence . For gr aduate level programs, no more than one-third of the total number of required credits that contributed to one's GPA may be granted to a student as transfer credit for work done at another gradu- ate institution . The Graduate College: Core Curriculum The Graduate College curriculum is designed to enhance interac - tion among students from all the programs while at the same time provide the basic knowledge base the faculty have deemed necessary to become successful in science . T he Graduate College curriculum runs for two consecutive semesters (fall and spring) and provides introductory training in molecular genetics, genom-ics and protein biology, cell biology, tissue biology and cell signaling, as well as provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of physiology and pharmacology . Students will also learn basic theories underlying modern scientific technique . In addition, the student will take courses in ethics, scientific writ- ing and basic statistics . T hese courses will be supplemented by advanced courses offered by the individual divisions . The following courses constitute the Graduate College Core (GCC) GCC-501 Transport and Signaling GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology GCC-504 Functional T issue Biology GCC-505 Techniques in Biomedical Sciences GCC-506 Research Ethics GCC-507 Biomedical Statistics GCC-508 Scientific Writing GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology GCC-512 Readings in Cellular Biochemistry GCC-513 Readings in Functional Cell Biology 216 GCC-514 Readings in Functional T issue Biology GCC-520 Introduction to Physiology and Pharmacology I GCC-521 Introduction to Physiology and Pharmacology II GCC-546 Principles of Biostatistics I GCC-547 Principles of Biostatistics II GCC-551 Ethics in Biomedical Research and the IRB GCC-593 Introduction to Grantsmanship GCC-620 Introduction to T eaching In addition to these requirements, full-time doctor of philosophy (PhD) candidates in the Graduate College must attend a mini-mum of four ethics seminars per year provided by the Office of Research Integrity following their first year of classes . Failure to attend the required number of lectures or equivalent will delay graduation . The Graduate College: MS and PhD Degrees The Graduate College prepares students for the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees . T he Doctor of Philosophy is awarded in recognition of high achievement in a particular field of scientific research as evidenced by submission of a dissertation that demonstrates the power of independent investigation and contributes to the body of existing knowl- edge . An undergraduate record of scholastic excellence is an important background for the Graduate College experience . T he Graduate College also provides excellent research and training opportunities for advanced medical students who want to take time out of their medical school studies to enroll in the Graduate College in an MS or PhD program . T he process of application review includes a search for evidence of creativity and schol- arly potential in the applicant . Non-degree students are not admitted with advanced degree objectives and are ineligible to become candidates for advanced degrees . Upon approval by a course director and appropriate registration, any individual may audit a course . In all cases, a student considering application for admission should first establish contact with the director of his or her choice of program to determine divisional/program requirements . T he student must meet all of the requirements for progress and graduation in the graduate studies program . In this regard, individualized studies will be programmed to meet the student's need in achieving essential knowledge in preparation for these requirements . Doctor of Philosophy The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is the highest degree conferred by Rush University . T he PhD is restricted to those scholars who have demonstrated superior ability in a recognized academic discipline . While each division has identified require - ments, the PhD degree is not awarded following the completion of any specific number of formal courses nor on the basis of miscellaneous course studies and research . T he entire PhD pro - gram must be integrated and highly research oriented . It should culminate in a work of literary and scholarly merit, which is indicative of the candidate's ability to conduct original research in a recognized specialty (generally in the form of a first-author manuscript) . PhD programs are directed by selected faculty who work closely with graduate students . In practice , each program is composed of formal courses, guided individual study in a chosen field or discipline, study in such cognate subjects as may be required by the candidate's advisory committee and original research that serves as the basis of a required scholarly dissertation . Admission to Candidacy Admission to candidacy is evidence that the doctoral student has successfully completed all preliminary coursework and is prepared to move into his or her intensive research experience . Depending upon the divisional requirements, these exams will test accumulated knowledge, scientific reasoning and the ability to develop hypotheses and test them with appropriate designs . Admission to candidacy is a demonstration of confidence that the student will successfully accomplish the remaining require- ments of the program . Students failing to achieve admission to candidacy, but who have otherwise completed all other prereq- uisites, will be granted a terminal master's degree . Dissertation A doctoral student must complete a dissertation . T his document is developed through faculty-guided independent research proj- ects . Review of the dissertation will follow the sequence of steps described in the manual \"Preparation of Theses and Doctoral Dissertations .\" Copies of this manual are av ailable in each graduate division and in the Library of Rush University Medical Center . The dissertation must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or at any other university . Each student will have a dissertation committee whose role it is to assure that the student's dissertation is of high quality and meets the standards of the division, the college and the University for originality, contribution to the field and scholarly presentation . The committee is also to assure that the student is 217 making satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree . The dissertation committee is chosen by the student in conjunc- tion with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least five total members . T he primary advisor must be a member of the Graduate College . At least one member of the commit - tee should be from outside of the division, and preferably from outside of the institution . Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson, who cannot be the student's primary advisor . The chairperson will oversee the scheduling and activi - ties of the committee . At or near the completion of the dissertation, each student will share, by means of a public presentation with the academic community at large, the knowledge that the student has devel- oped . Students are responsible for posting announcements (at least two weeks prior to the presentation) on institutional bulle-tin boards and emailing all faculty and students of the Graduate College the title of the dissertation, the student's name, and the location, date and time of the public presentation . T his public presentation must precede the final approval of the dissertation by the dissertation committee . Upon completion of the public presentation, the student will meet with the dissertation committee to review the presenta-tion, the dissertation document and the student's preparedness to enter the scientific community . A majority of members of the committee must sign the dissertation certifying the completion of all requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy degree . Master of Science The Master of Science degree is offered in many divisions and programs . T his degree is designed to offer students an intermediate step in a career path, provide research experi-ence to supplement their primary professional path or provide supplementary training for other reasons . T he college offers two types of MS degrees: 1) the research MS is a thesis-requiring program that traditionally takes two years to complete; and 2) a non-research MS that is a consequence of either a scholarly endeavor (e .g ., writing a review paper) or the successful comple - tion of a series of classes and laboratory skills (i .e ., the MS in Biotechnology) . Thesis The research MS degree requires publication of a scientific thesis that reflects the research experience of the student . T his thesis may or may not reflect original work, although original work that is published in peer-reviewed journals is always a goal . T he student together with the advisor will form a thesis commit-tee composed of three members: the advisor (who must be a member of the Graduate College) and two readers . T he advisor will work with the student to develop a research project that can be completed within the framework of the program . T he readers will assure the quality of the document . Upon comple - tion of the thesis, the student will present the findings in a pub- lic forum open to the University . T he members of the committee that includes the student's advisor must sign off on the thesis, certifying the completion of all requirements for the MS degree . The Graduate College: Academic Policies The Graduate College adopts college-wide policies and proce- dures and reviews division-specific regulations . Students follow the college and divisional policies in effect at the time of initial matriculation in the Graduate College . However, the Graduate College reserves the right to make substantive changes in its programs after the student's matriculation . Students will be informed in writing by the division director of any changes made during their tenure in the program . Students re-entering the col - lege after an absence will be guided by policies and procedures in effect at the time of re-entry . Examination Policy The examination policy is the responsibility of the individual course director, who will inform students of examination require - ments for that particular course . A period at the end of the semester is provided for examinations . T his period may be used as the course director chooses . Pass/No Pass Grades Each division identifies all courses required of its students . Required courses are usually taken for letter grade and not under the pass/no pass (P/N) option . Research hours are gener - ally graded using the P/N option . However, a division may opt to provide a letter grade for research classes (under 600) for mas- ter's students . T he grading policy for post-candidacy research hours (over 600) for doctoral students is P/N . Good Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3 .0 and meet the require - ments of their division . A student must be in good academic standing to be admitted to candidacy and to graduate . Students failing to maintain a GPA of 3 .0 will be notified by the Dean in writing that their student status has been changed to \"on pro- bation .\" Students who fail to remediate their deficiencies within one academic year or are placed on probationary status a third time are subject to dismissal by the Graduate College . 218 Academic Difficulty Each division has policies and procedures regarding students who fail to maintain good academic standing . While the respon - sibilities of informing students of their academic problems and of establishing conditions for regaining good academic standing reside within the divisions, the Graduate College Council moni-tors the progress and promotion of all students and gives final approval to award students' degrees . Dismissal Each division establishes grounds for dismissal beyond the minimal criteria established by the Graduate College . Should a division recommend the dismissal of a student, the director will forward such recommendation to the Graduate College Council for final action . Letters of dismissal come from the Dean . Appeal of a dismissal action begins within the appropriate division . Full-time Enrollment Full-time enrollment is required of all Graduate College students with the exception of Clinical Research students and students within the divisions of Nursing and Health Sciences . Full-time students must register for at least 12 semester hours for the fall and spring semesters and for 9 credit hours for the summer term of the first year; 10 semester hours thereafter per term are required for full-time enrollment . Students must obtain writ - ten permission from the division director for exceptions to this policy . Students receiving a master's degree from the Gr aduate College as a full-time student must be enrolled for a minimum of two semesters and the summer term; part-time students earning a master's degree must be enrolled a minimum of two semesters per academic year . T he minimum requirement for graduation from the college is 53 hours . At the time of gr adua - tion, the student must be enrolled in the college . T he maximum time allowed for enrollment for a full-time master's degree is four years starting with the first semester of official enrollment, and the maximum time allowed for the PhD degree is five years . Residency Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates are expected to meet all requirements for graduation within five enrolled academic years in the Graduate College (excluding leaves of absence; see below) . This period begins with the semester in which the student formally matriculates . A student exceeding that time limitation must submit to the Graduate Council, in writing, a request to extend his or her candidacy beyond that time period . This request must identify the reasons for the extension and provide a written plan with reasonable deadlines for completion . This document will be co-signed by the student's advisor and division director . T he council will then vote whether to accept the extension or not (passed by simple majority) . T he student's advi - sor will then provide an update on the student's progress after six months . One year after the extension is granted, the student is expected to complete all requirements . A second request may be made by the student's advisor and division director, but only will be accepted through a two-thirds majority of the voting members present at a formal hearing of the Graduate College Council . Within one year of that second request, the student must complete all requirements for the PhD degree or face dis- missal . Alternatively, the student may be awarded a MS degree upon the recommendation of the student's graduate division . Readmission Any student who has withdrawn from the University or any dismissed student may apply for readmission by submitting an application for this purpose to the Graduate College admis- sion office . An interview may be required . A re-entering student must meet the conditions for re-enrollment stated in his or her dismissal or re-entry acceptance letter and all policies, require- ments and course sequences in effect at the time of re-entry . T he student will pay tuition and fees at the rates in effect at the time of re-enrollment . Application deadlines may v ary by division . Academic Progression The graduate division, in concert with the rules of the college and Rush University, develops specific regulations governing the process that results in final awarding of the degree . While such regulations differ slightly from one division to another, the Graduate College Council reviews each track's program and regulations for approval . In all cases, graduate divisions are required to be explicit and clear about regulations that will affect the candidate . T his must be stringently observed in divisional regulations concerning selection of principal advisors, advisory committees, and plans of study . Similarly, divisions will be explicit and clear concerning academic policies and proce-dures surrounding qualifying, preliminary and final examinations when they are required . T he divisions are also responsible for providing the candidate with the support needed to plan and conduct the dissertation research . At the same time , a major responsibility of the student is to become familiar with the regulations and expectations of his or her chosen division . T hese regulations and expectations are included in this catalog within the sections devoted to each divisional program and are also included within program publications . T he student is responsible for understanding the regulations and monitoring changes that may occur during his or her tenure in the program . 219 Student Academic Appeals Policy Any student of the Graduate College may appeal a final course grade, failure on a preliminary or comprehensive examination, or failure of the thesis/dissertation that results in his or her academic probation or dismissal from the University . A student may also appeal an unreasonable delay in his or her graduation from the University . No other issues may be appealed through this process . The process for filing an appeal is maintained by each division . The student may request a copy of the division appeal process from the division director . T his process will be completed within one semester . If a resolution cannot be achieved at the division level, the following procedure must be followed . At any step in the process, the student may withdraw the appeal by written notification to the program director with a copy to the Dean . In the event of a dismissal decision, a student may continue to enroll until the appeal process is completed or the student withdraws the appeal . Step 1: If the student wishes to appeal the decision beyond the division, within two weeks of receiving a decision from the division, the student will submit a written statement to the Dean requesting consideration of his or her case by an advisory panel . The student must provide the following in the written statement . Course number and grade being appealed or other cause for probation or dismissal, i .e ., failure of preliminary/comprehen - sive examination or thesis/dissertation Action being requested Justification for the request An outline of the efforts and actions already taken to obtain consideration of the request The student will send copies of this communication to the divi- sion director and the department chairperson . In addition, if a course grade is being appealed, the student will send a copy to the course director . If the evaluation of a thesis or dissertation is being appealed, the student will send a copy to the chairperson of the thesis/dissertation committee . T he advisory panel will be the Graduate College Council . Its chairperson will be appointed by the Dean from among the members . T he division director of the student's division and any other member who is evaluating the student's academic status will not vote . Step 2: Within two weeks after notification to the Dean, the chairperson of the advisory panel will arrange a meeting of the advisory panel . It will submit a written recommendation to the Dean . Step 3: Within two weeks following receipt of the advisory panel's recommendation and upon discussion with the student and with others as appropriate, the Dean shall reach a final decision and notify each party of the decision . T he decision reached by the Dean is final . The issues discussed and the outcomes of all meetings in this appeal process are documented . T his record-keeping is the responsibility of a faculty member who is to be designated at each meeting . Copies of the documentation should be distrib - uted to the individuals present at a meeting, to the division director, and to the Dean and placed into the student's academic file . Rush University Academic Policies The Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains additional Rush University academic policies . The Graduate College: Committees The Graduate College Council The Graduate College Council is the senior representative body of the college . Its membership includes all division directors, the directors of the Master's in Biotechnology and Clinical Research programs, an elected faculty member from each division and three students from different divisions elected by the students annually . Only the elected members and students are allowed to vote . The Dean or his or her designee serves as the chair of the council . The council is responsible for setting policies for the admission of students; the formulation and adoption of general operating policies, standards and procedures of the college; the appointment of Graduate College faculty; and the approval of those recommended for degrees .220 The Graduate College: Academic Programs Anatomy and Cell Biology (MS and PhD*) Biochemistry (MS and PhD*)Biomechanics (MS and PhD*)Biotechnology (MS) Clinical Research (MS) Health Sciences (PhD)Immunology/Microbiology (MS and PhD*) Integrated Biomedical Sciences (PhD)Medical Physics (PhD*)Radiological Science (MS)Molecular Biophysics and Physiology (PhD*)Neuroscience (PhD*)Nursing Science (PhD) Pharmacology (MS and PhD*) *PhD: PhD program is closed for entry beginning Fall 2015. 221 Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Philosophy The PhD in integrated Biomedical Sciences is designed to educate science professionals for leadership in research and academic positions, as well as provide career path education relevant to their specialized field .

Students in the program will work with faculty and scientists to generate new knowledge in the fields of biomedicine using sophisticated research methods and statistics . As a part of the program, students are required to pass a comprehensive preliminary examination and demonstrate their knowledge of core and concentration-specific coursework . T hey will design and conduct research that culminates in a disserta-tion, and they will disseminate their scientific findings through scholarly publications and presentations . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester in order to begin the required coursework in the core curriculum . T he deadline for submission of applications is generally March 1 . International applications can be accepted after March 1 but must take into consideration the delays associated with the necessary visa arrangements . T he Integrated Biomedical Sciences Program has the following requirements for admission to the program: A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college Coursework in biology, cellular biology, molecular biology, physics, chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry and mathematics, including calculus, is highly recommended . Upper-level biochemistry or physiology courses are also highly recommended . Academic transcripts from all baccalaureate and post- baccalaureate educational experiences are required . T hese should provide a minimal grade point average of 3 .0 overall (A = 4 .0) . Higher grades are expected in science courses and evidence of research experience is preferred . GRE or MCAT scores are required . All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) .

BTN = Biotechnology course In years 3-5 the emphasis is on research . Students work with their track director, their dissertation advisor and their committee to determine the most appropriate mix of electives and research hours . A typical registration is listed below: GCC XXX Electives: 9 credit hours total to be dispersed among the 2nd through 4th years GCC XXX Cognates (track specific requirements): 8 hours in the 2nd through 4th years GCC 694-698 Adv anced Topics:1 semester hour each fall and spring term of the 2nd through 4th years . T he topic course should align with the student's track or research interests . GCC 699 Dissertation Research (1 semester hour each fall and spring term, 2 semester hours in the summer terms): Although there is a low number of credit hours, it is considered to be a full time commitment to research . While registrations appear similar in years 3-5, the nature and character of the research changes and the student passes through a number of steps towards completion of the PhD .Integrated Biomedical Sciences: PhD Dissertation Program Progression Year 1 Classes and Comprehensive Exam: The goal of the coursework in the first year is to expose the students to the biomedical sciences to enable them to design and approach a research problem from molecular, biochemical, cellular and organ system perspectives . T he reading courses provide a critical understanding of the literature and existing base of knowledge . T hey will also show the student how new knowledge in these areas can help us understand diseases and use this information to identify new therapeutics . T his broad-based approach to disease is the core of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences program . In the spring semester, the Topics in Biomedical Integration course (GCC 531) is offered . In this course, a specific disease will be studied from the molecular perspective to organ system failure under faculty direction . T he students will then have a group project in which they use the approaches they have learned to study another disease . T his project will strengthen student skills in preparation for the com- prehensive exam . In the summer, GCC 532, Topics in Biomedical Integration II, is the comprehensive exam, in which students will be given an individualized disease topic related to their planned research . They will be required to write a literature review approaching the topic from each biomedical perspective . Year 1 Research Experience: During the first year the student will have three lab rotations . Each rotation must be in a different laboratory . For uncommitted students (funded by the Graduate College or the NIH), the labo-ratory rotations will expose the student to a range of research environments . Students are expected to learn techniques and attend all lab meetings, etc . Based on these rotations, the student will submit the names of three potential advisors with a priority ranking to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences education committee . The Integrated Biomedical Sciences education com - mittee, in consultation with the potential advisors, will decide which student will be matched with which advisor . Students committed to a particular laboratory (funded by the research advisor's grants) are still required to take three laboratory rota - tions . During the first year, the student will select a track and will identify potential research advisors . T he program director, the track director and the potential research advisors will then select the student's comprehensive exam topic . Advisors will be identified by the end of the summer term, following the compre- hensive exam and completion of rotations . 223 Year 2 Track Selection, Research Experience, Qualifying Exam The selection of a research advisor will significantly influence the student's selection of a research track . Subsequent classes will be dictated by the track cognates and electives and by relevant electives offered in other tracks . T he selection of electives should complement research activity and the interests of the student and should help prepare him or her for the career choice identi-fied through the use of the Individual Development Plan (IDP) website and additional resources provided by the Graduate College . When the student is not in class or studying, the student should be working on his or her research project . T he goals of the 2nd year are to learn the relevant laboratory techniques and to develop a research proposal in conjunction with the research advisor . The research project will advance knowledge in a specific discipline and yield first-author scientific publications for the student . The student's research proposal should include at least three specific aims and be written up as an F31 grant (See \"Dissertation Proposal and Presentation\" below) . T he student must select a dissertation committee and present the proposal to the committee by the end of the 2nd year . T he proposal presentation to the committee is considered the qualifying exam . Acceptance of the proposal by the dissertation committee means the student is a candidate for the PhD . The student's assessment at this time relates to the following student outcomes: The graduate is able to acquire research skills, collect and analyze data, and interpret results in order to address an original research question . In addition, this step begins the continuing assessment of the following outcomes: A graduating student is capable of independent critical thinking and writing as well as proposing, performing and effectively presenting his or her research . The graduate is able to work collaboratively with other scientists, physicians and health care professionals to give and obtain feedback concerning the approach to research problems, data analysis and implications of research . The student creates an Individual Development Plan (IDP) to better define his or her areas of interest including teaching, administration, research in industry, or academic research . Upon graduation, the graduate will have used the IDP , mentorship and training opportunities to refine his or her career path . Student progress is evaluated at the end of each year in years 2-5 . For year 2, the student's mentor and track director will assess student progress relative to expected outcomes . In years 3-5, the student will submit a written report document- ing progress toward expected outcomes . T he mentor and track director will also submit their assessment of student progress for the year . Then a meeting with the student, mentor, and track director will take place at the end of each year to discuss the student's progress . Year 3-5 Research Progress/Publications/Dissertation The research advisor monitors the day-to-day progress of the student . The dissertation committee will meet at least once per year to monitor progress and to approve any changes to the proposed research project . T he committee may meet more frequently, especially after the approval of the student's research proposal . The student is expected to attend national meetings, make presentations, present posters, etc ., and become a part of the scientific community . Likewise , the student should be submit - ting research articles . T he program requires that the research project yield at least one first-authored research article accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal . T he publication requirement is necessary but not sufficient for graduation . T he dissertation committee will continue to assess student prog-ress on the aims and determines when the student has com- pleted his or her dissertation . (See \"Dissertation Proposal and Presentation\" below .) The student's assessment continues on the outcomes listed above with emphasis on the growth of research and commu- nication skills . Likewise it is expected that the communication outcomes will also become more centered on written commu-nication in the form of abstracts, peer-reviewed journal articles and the dissertation as the student begins to complete the following outcome: The graduate is able to contribute to the scientific literature in an area of expertise via published abstracts, a dissertation and by the publication of a first-authored research article in a refereed journal . Minimal Credit Hours Required for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD Degree The PhD in Integrated Biomedical Sciences should be completed in five years and requires completion of 145 semester hours of credit distributed as follows: core courses (37), concentration specific cognates (16), electives (9), and dissertation research (83) . The core curriculum, which will be common to all stu - dents, builds knowledge and skills in research theories and 224 methodology, data analysis and statistics, laboratory applica - tions and skills, and the molecular and cellular sciences basic to health and disease . T hese courses will provide systematic expo - sure to the contemporary process of scientific discovery and will serve as the basis for the remainder of the curriculum . Adv anced students entering with a master's (MS) degree in a biomedical science or a doctor of medicine (MD) degree may have classes in the first two years waived based on their prior record . T he degree may then be completed in a shorter time providing the student progresses through the process outlined below . Students will be required, in conjunction with their advisors, to select from concentration-focused cognates in one of five tracks: Translational Cancer Research; Cardiovascular and Respiratory Biology; Immunity, Inflammation, and Infection; Disorders of the Musculoskeletal System; and Disorders of the Nervous System . All students will be required to participate in track-specific Advanced Topic Seminars that span terms 4 through 15 . All students will also be required to complete a minimum of 83 semester hours dedicated to completion of their dissertation research . Dissertation hours are consistent across all natural science PhD programs in the Graduate College and encompass laboratory research time required for completion of the disserta-tion, including analyzing published data; developing a research proposal; learning and applying advanced methodologies and statistical data analyses; developing skills to write and submit a pre-doctoral training grant application; practicing presentation skills to disseminate one's own research findings in national conferences; writing in the form of a research publication; and developing and defending a dissertation project Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Academic Policies Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The IBS program director functions as the academic advisor to the students during the first year of matriculation in the program . At the end of the first year, the student will identify the track that he or she wishes to enter and will begin working in the laboratory of his or her research advisor . At this time , the track director along with the research advisor will serve as men- tors for the student . Research Advisor Selection During the first year, the student, in consultation with the program director and track directors in areas related to the student's interests, will select three laboratories for research rotations . Based on these rotations, the student will identify the track he or she is interested in and submit the names of three potential advisors with a priority ranking to the IBS education committee . The IBS education committee, in consultation with the potential advisors, will decide which students will be matched with which advisors . Students who upon entering the program are committed to a particular laboratory (funded by the research advisor's grants) are still required to take three labora- tory rotations . T he student's research project should advance knowledge in a specific discipline and yield first-author scientific publications for the student . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: Track/Research Opportunities The research tracks for the Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD program are Translational Cancer Research; Cardiovascular and Respiratory Biology; Immunity, Inflammation, and Infection; Functions and Disorders of the Musculoskeletal System; and Functions and Disorders of the Nervous System . T he tracks include qualified faculty from Rush University Medical Center who have an interest in research in these tracks . T hey come from academic departments as well as clinical departments, which enables the students to select a variety of individuals with basic and clinical expertise to serve on their advisory committees and guide them through their projects . Qualifying Exams Comprehensive Exam: In the summer quarter following the first year of classes, all students will take GCC 532, Topics in Biomedical Integration II . T his course is their comprehen - sive exam, in which students will be given an individualized disease topic related to their planned research . T hey will be required to write a literature review approaching the topic . This comprehensive exam assures that the student can approach a research or clinical problem from a variety of perspectives, accounting for the published literature that illuminates the molecular, cellular and organ system manifes- tations of the disease process . Qualifying Exam (Dissertation Proposal and Presentation): The student must select a dissertation committee and present the proposal to the committee by the end of the 2nd year . The student's research proposal should include at least three specific aims and be written up as an F31 grant . Acceptance of the proposal by the dissertation committee means the student is a candidate for the PhD . Dissertation Research Committee After passing comprehensive exams, the student selects a research advisor and begins to collect preliminary data . By the end of spring of the 2nd year the student and advisor will select a research committee in consultation with the track 225 director . This committee will advise the student and evaluate his or her dissertation . T he Graduate College requires that the committee include five members and that one member be the student's mentor/advisor . A majority of the committee (at least three members) must be faculty at Rush who are members of the Graduate College . T he chair of this committee, who cannot be the student's mentor/advisor, will be chosen at the first committee meeting and will preside at all subsequent meetings and arrange for a timely completion of the dissertation work . T he dissertation committee will strive for consensus in all its actions; however, a majority vote of the committee's membership is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the dissertation, in which case only one member may disagree with the final decision . In addition to the five committee members, either the director of the graduate program, the associate director or a track director will serve as an ex officio member of the committee . Dissertation Proposal and Presentation All students will present a thesis proposal before the end of the spring semester of their 2nd year that they have developed with their thesis advisor and graduate committee . T he format for the written portion of this requirement is the standard Individual National Research Service Award (F31) mechanism . In addition, a comprehensive review of the literature relevant to the proposed studies is highly recommended as an adjunct document for this requirement . (All students are highly encouraged to submit these proposals to the National Institutes of Health for consideration of funding . The schedule for submission deadlines is April 8, August 8, and December 8 of every year .) Once the written document is completed, the thesis proposal will be presented in a seminar format to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences program with the written portion provided to the student's committee at least one week prior to the presentation date . A formal committee meeting with thesis proposal defense will follow this presenta- tion . During this meeting, the quality and merit of the project will be assessed, and a determination as to whether the work satisfies the degree requirements or what measures for remedia-tion are required to satisfy this requirement will be made at this time . Upon successful completion of this requirement the status of doctoral candidate is conferred on the student . It is recom - mended that this requirement be satisfied as early in the 2nd year as is reasonably attainable . In the event a student does not satisfy this requirement before the termination of the fall semes-ter of the 3rd year, the student and advisor will need to present to the IBS education committee a reason as to why this require- ment has not been satisfied and provide a plan for remediation . Once the dissertation proposal requirement has been satisfied, all students will present an annual update to their committee in an identical format as the original proposal meeting with exception to the anticipated year for graduation . Again, after the seminar, a meeting of each doctoral candidate with his or her committee will occur and progress in the last year of the project and in the candidate's career development will reviewed . A detailed written account for each area should be distributed to the committee prior to this meeting . In addition to this, the website that helps students identify career goals, my Individual Development Plan (myIDP), should be used whenever possible to track and report all professional development activities . Completion of the Degree In the candidate's final year, a thesis data defense will be presented to the candidate's thesis committee demonstrat-ing that satisfactory progress has been made on the project to justify development of a plan to complete all experiments and to initiate dissertation preparation . Upon completion of this phase, the student will present the dissertation to the University in written form (approved by the director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center) and present the work in a public one-hour lecture attended by the dissertation committee and faculty and students of the University . T he dissertation committee will then meet in closed session with additional questions and will approve the dissertation . T ypically the meeting immediately fol - lows the public lecture . In line with the rules and procedures of the Graduate College, the committee strives for a consensus, but the dissertation can be approved over the objections of a single committee member . However, if two committee members disap - prove the dissertation, then it is not approved . T he awarding of the PhD degree requires the demonstration of a capability for independent research and a contribution to scientific knowledge . It is assumed that one or more research articles will be included in the dissertation . Since a peer-reviewed, first-authored research article is required for the degree, the dissertation is not considered complete until the publication of this article . If publication is pending, the committee may sign off on the dissertation, but the program director will not sign off until the paper is published . The registrar's office must be notified of impending completion of the degree by submission of an Intent to Graduate form at the beginning of the final semester . As the dissertation is reach - ing final form, the student should consult with the University librarian to assure that the dissertation is formatted correctly . Once the dissertation is approved, the student will complete the final checklist to assure that all necessary approvals have been obtained . Students will be required to have an exit interview and provide feedback concerning their experience at Rush University .226 Student Grievance Procedure A student who is having difficulty with a course and anticipates being absent from class or faces an emergency that will impact his or her attendance or performance should contact his or her course director . A student with a problem in labor atory rotations or research should attempt to resolve the issue through direct communication with the laboratory advisor or mentor . A good faith attempt to plan/resolve any issues directly with the course director, laboratory advisor or mentor should always be the first course of action . If this fails, the student should bring the con - cern to the program director if the student is a first-year student or to their track director if the student has already identified a track . The program director or track director will work with the student and faculty member(s) to resolve the issue . If it is a seri - ous issue, the program director, track director or faculty member may involve the Education Committee . T he student may also appeal directly to the Education Committee by requesting in writ- ing that it meet to discuss the issue . T he Education Committee will meet within 10 days to render a judgment to best address the interests of the student within the guidelines of the Integrated Biomedical Sciences PhD program . Students must maintain a B average in the first year . If they drop below a B average, they should discuss the possibility of remediation with the director of the course they had difficulty with . The course director may issue an incomplete grade for a limited time in accordance with university policy while agreed- upon remediation takes place . However, once a failing grade (No Pass or letter grade less than B) has been given, the Education Committee must approve a remediation plan . Until a grade is remedied or the average is improved in some other way, the student is on probation . A student who remains on probation for two semesters will be dismissed . Students who have entered a track must receive at least a B grade in any courses deemed required by their tract director . Failure to remediate a grade of less than B in a required course or a no-pass grade in a pass/no-pass course or the receipt of another such grade while on probation will result in dismissal . The Education Committee will also hear complaints concern-ing academic dishonesty, nonprofessional behavior and student misconduct . The council may become involved through a direct request from a student or faculty member or by a referral from the Honor Code Committee . If the Honor Code Committee has not been involved, the council may refer the initial request to the Honor Code Committee . T he council will hear testimony from any involved faculty and/or students . T he council may recom - mend remediation or disciplinary measures . Recommendations for expulsion or suspension are made to the office of the Dean of the Graduate College . Appeals will be heard by the Gr aduate College Council (GCC) or a subcommittee of the GCC that will be organized solely for the purpose of hearing the appeal and making a recommendation to the Dean . T he ultimate decision regarding student expulsion or suspension rests in the office of the Dean of the Graduate College . Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to the Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog . In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies . Integrated Biomedical Sciences: PhD Tuition Scholarship and Stipend All students who are admitted to the IBS PhD program at Rush University Medical Center will receive a tuition waiver and stipend . The stipend is awarded annually and renewed if the student remains in good standing . T o remain in good standing, the Graduate College requires that students maintain at least a \"B\" average . Failure to do so will result in the student being on probation . If the student does not have a B average following one semester of probation, the student may lose the stipend . Students are expected to attend all classes and spend the appropriate time in the lab . All outside employment is forbid - den without prior graduate college approval as it interferes with the time and effort necessary to complete the program . This excludes activities that would be in line with Individual Development Plan goals like tutoring, teaching and proctoring . Anatomy and Cell Biology Note for the Current Academic Year: Incoming PhD students should refer to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences section of this catalog. The following information is intended for incoming MS students, current MS and current PhD students. Questions about the future plans should be directed to the program director. Anatomy and Cell Biology: Philosophy The Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology offers study at both the master's (MS) and doctoral (PhD) levels . T he master's degree requires a thesis on a laboratory-based research project . T he programs are intended for students interested in research and in acquisition of strong foundations in functional human anatomy 227 and tissue biology . T he principal, although not exclusive, focus of research in the department is on the biology of skeletal disease, repair and regeneration . T his work is founded in strong interdisciplinary alliances associated with the Rush Arthritis and Orthopedics Institute . T his consortium includes the Department of Biochemistry, with its focus on cartilage and connective tissue research; the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, which sponsors research on surgical and therapeutic interventions and sup-ports Rush's gait and biomechanics laboratory; and the Section of Rheumatology, which hosts ongoing studies on arthritis and inflammatory connective tissue disease . The scope of this work, with its underlying orientation to skeletal and joint disease, provides an excellent forum for graduate study . A premium is placed on critical thinking and communication skills that can help students translate new ideas into effective research questions and lines of investigation . T hese skills are central to the production of effective grants and publications and to their future roles as scientists and educators . Exploration of structure-function relationships is an exploding frontier for the contemporary anatomist in the medical research setting . Anatomists, like most scientists, are reinventing themselves and their fields in the study of basic disease processes . Extraordinary capabilities of new imaging technology and partnerships with other scientists put structural biologists into the mainstream of mapping molecular processes into three-dimensional space of cells, tissues and organs . T his collaborative environment, in both education and research, is a great source of intellectual and personal enrichment . Anatomy and Cell Biology: Admission Requirements Applicants are encouraged to complete their application files by April 1 preceding the intended date of admission because the course cycle begins in the fall semester . Applications , however, will be considered on a rolling basis for applicants to the MS or PhD degree program who are enrolled in Rush Medical College or other individuals eligible for advanced standing, e .g ., in post-professional master's work . Rush Medical College students must go on a leave of absence from the Medical College while pursuing an MS or PhD degree in the Graduate College and will reenter Rush Medical College upon graduation from the Graduate College . The Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology seeks students whose backgrounds demonstrate motivation toward research and teaching as well as a capacity for independent study . Consideration is given to the student's area of interest with respect to the expertise of individual faculty . Preferences for majors in biological sciences should include labo-ratory experience as well as coursework experience in anatomy, physiology, cell and molecular biology, and embryology/develop- mental biology . Students with backgrounds supporting interests in biomechanics or kinesiology should contact the program director . Acceptable academic and test performances (GPA/GRE/MCAT/ TOEFL) are described in the Graduate College guidelines . Specific divisional admission requirements may be waived at the discre- tion of the Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology's Graduate Advisory Committee, thus giving the student advanced standing in either the master's or doctoral program . Anatomy and Cell Biology: Academic Policies The division is bound by academic policies of the University and the Graduate College . Assessment of Progress The student's progress will be assessed continuously based upon performance in the courses taken and upon evaluations by the Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology's Graduate Advisory Committee . Good academic standing necessary for graduation requires maintenance of a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3 .0 . Students who fail to earn at least \"B\" grades in courses within the division, or whose overall GPA falls below 3 .0, are placed on probationary status for review of their progress by the Graduate Advisory Committee . Pending this review , any student on probation may be recommended for a remedial action or for dismissal from the program . An outline of these specific aca - demic policies and grievance mechanisms is accessible on the departmental website; a printed version may be obtained from the graduate program director . Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to the Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog . In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies . Anatomy and Cell Biology: Curriculum Doctoral Degree in Anatomy and Cell Biology The first- and second-year curricula are devoted to anatomy coursework and complementary electives selected from cell and molecular biology, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, immu- nology, neuroscience, biostatistics and ethics in research . Methods and special topics courses during the first year help the student select and work more closely with his or her research advisor 228 and identify project lines for dissertation research . Participation in the departmental journal club is expected each semester . T his is primarily a research-based degree, but doctoral students are also encouraged to serve as instructional assistants in the core anatomy courses to improve their comfort level in working with students and anticipating future roles in teaching . Admission to degree candidacy for dedication to dissertation research is contingent upon successful completion of: 1) coursework requirements, 2) a written comprehensive examination and 3) a dissertation proposal to be presented to the student's disserta- tion committee for approval . Master's Degree in Anatomy and Cell Biology The master's degree is a research-based degree requiring a thesis based on laboratory or experimental work of limited scope . There is some flexibility in selecting courses to meet the master's degree requirements . T he core courses that students select to meet these requirements are minimized in order to direct students' efforts to their thesis projects beginning in the first year . Completion of the full course complement and thesis research would ordinarily take two years . Core courses are based on corresponding courses in Rush Medical College, but may include a supplement for graduate students . In these sessions students are variously presented with problems and are encouraged to explore material from historical or contemporary perspectives in the literature, perform and dem-onstrate special dissections, and discuss or present material on assigned topics . W eekly journal club meeting on selected topics provide an opportunity for students to discuss papers under fac- ulty supervision . T hese sessions expose students to methods and experimental studies outside the mainstream of their laboratory setting . The journal club provides experience in critical review of literature with a focus on experimental design and presentation and interpretation of data . Faculty participation in these discus - sions helps broaden students' perspectives .

The research advisor must hold an appointment in the Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology . T he research advisor assists the student in development of a dissertation/thesis pro-posal, selection of a dissertation/thesis committee and oversight of the dissertation research and writing . T he student, in consul - tation with the research advisor and graduate program director, is responsible for assuring that his or her graduate coursework satisfies requirements of both the division and the Graduate College for completion of the degree . Thesis Requirements for Master's Students After completion of their coursework and initiation of their research, students identify a master's thesis committee (three members) and present their thesis proposal for review . T he composition of the committee is governed by the Graduate College's Policy and Procedures document . T his proposal is ordinarily scheduled toward the end of summer after their first year . Completion of the study, the thesis and its presentation and defense are to be completed by May in order to qualify for a June graduation . Anatomy and Cell Biology: Candidacy Requirements for Doctoral Students Preliminary Examination After completing the course requirements, the student must take the preliminary examination in order to qualify for degree candidacy . This examination emphasizes the student's ability to synthesize material, to solve problems and to communicate verbally and in writing . T he first part of this examination consists of a written, comprehensive examination on course material . The second part, an oral examination, is based on the student's dissertation proposal . Dissertation Upon completion of both parts of the preliminary examination, the degree candidate devotes his or her time mainly to disserta- tion research and writing . T he dissertation must be an original experimental or applied study; its format and review must com- ply with requirements of the Graduate College . T he candidate must present the work in a University-wide forum and defend the completed dissertation before his or her research committee . This dissertation committee should be composed of five members with at least one member from outside the division . An extr a- mural committee member is recommended . T he composition of the committee is governed by the Graduate College's Policy and Procedures document . Anatomy and Cell Biology: Advanced Placement The programs in Anatomy and Cell Biology are well-suited to medical students interested in pursuing an MS or PhD degree because of significant overlap in required coursework for these programs . Exemptions are ordinarily permitted for courses taken as medical students at Rush (or possibly other institutions), sub- ject to review by the departmental Graduate Advisory Committee . The MS for medical students provides an opportunity for students to engage in research training and to fulfill the thesis require- ment without significant additional coursework . T he thesis research is completed in one additional year, ordinarily between the student's second and third medical school years . T his training is significant for students seeking academic careers in medicine as physician-scientists but whose specialty interests require extended residency programs and post-residency fellowship commitments . The PhD program would typically follow a traditional 2-3-2 plan, with three years devoted to doctoral study between the medical preclinical and clinical programs . Students interested in pursuing a PhD degree should contact the program director to discuss the opportunities and application procedure . MS with Advanced Placement An advanced placement track is available for residents or clinical fellows who may be afforded extended time to pursue research . Students or graduates of Rush or accredited U .S . or Canadian medical schools are eligible for this advanced placement track . The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is ordinarily required, although applicants can petition for an exemption based on their MCAT scores . Proficiency exams administered by the program may be required to validate competency in certain areas or to help set up program plans . International medical graduates will be considered on a case-by-case basis . T heir eligibility is based on TOEFL and GRE scores as well as undergraduate medical records and recommendations . T he advanced placement track recognizes the medical course background of the applicants by exempting them from anatomy, histology and neurobiology 230 course requirements . T he emphasis is on research, laboratory- based training and project development with the completion and defense of their master's thesis . Anatomy and Cell Biology: Tuition Scholarships, Stipends and Employment Tuition Scholarships/Stipends Tuition scholarships are provided for all doctoral trainees along with stipend support equivalent to NIH guidelines and accord-ing to Graduate College's Policy and Procedures for predoctoral fellowships . No tuition forgiveness or stipends are provided to master's students . T uition and stipend for MD students pursu - ing an MS degree are based on Graduate College's Policy and Procedures and resources available to the department and the advisor . Paid Employment Outside employment is not permitted under ordinary circum- stances . A student who desires to work or needs to work for financial or other reasons is first advised to discuss his or her sit-uation with the research advisor, who can best assess potential issues that may relate to conduct of research or other degree requirements . If the student cannot resolve the situation with his or her advisor, the student may petition the program director to help arrive at a recommendation that is in the student's best interest . In any case, the program director should be apprised of any instances of employment . Anatomy and Cell Biology: Research Activities Research in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology stresses the pathobiology of tissue repair and regeneration in connective tissue (especially bone and cartilage), the eye and cancer biology . Many of these studies are directed to developing modes of protection against injury or finding ways that growth factors and cytokines can promote healing in experimental models . Biomedical projects closely allied to problems encoun - tered in the clinical setting are enriched by collaborative work with the Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, Biochemistry and Ophthalmology and the Section of Rheumatology . Students are encouraged to perform research in cross-disciplinary areas to take advantage of opportunities in the medical environment at Rush to develop basic research problems with a disease orienta- tion . In addition to the biomedical research detailed below, faculty members have interests in the development of new edu-cational constructs that use computers to facilitate instruction and applied learning through case study work . Faculty labo - ratories are located in the Armour Academic Center and Jelke Building . These laboratories support a variety of projects ranging in scope from cell and tissue culture work using molecular probes and biochemical methods to experimental surgery and studies on biomechanics and gait . T here is ready accessibility of scanning and transmission electron microscopy, a confocal microscope, mechanical testing equipment and a bioinstrumen-tation laboratory as well as opportunities in specialty labora- tories throughout the Medical Center . Most faculty members collaborate not only with other researchers at Rush but with investigators elsewhere in the United States and abroad . In this small department, a premium is placed on close relation- ships between students and their faculty mentors for guidance in development of new projects . T he department normally hosts post-doctoral MD or PhD investigators who are committed to related lines of investigation and who are valuable resources for students . Highlights of faculty research interests in the depart - ment are as follows . Bone Biology and Orthopedics Methods of enhancing bone regeneration for improving fixation of orthopedic implants (e .g ., for joint replacement) are being investigated in experimental models and in patients . T hese studies feature mechanisms by which bone adapts to altered mechanical stresses and to the presence of foreign materials in these devices . T he role of growth factors and cytokines is being studied in these models . (Sumner, Virdi) Bone Biology and the Bone Marrow Stroma Mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow stroma can give rise to a number of cell lineages, including osteogenic, chondro- genic, myogenic and adipogenic . Isolation and characterization of the early progenitors has a great potential for their use in clinical situations of tissue repair and regeneration . Our research interests focus on molecular studies using gene-expression pro-filing and the role of these cells as vehicles for delivering growth factors to the site of repair . (Virdi, Sumner) Joint Pathophysiology The pathophysiologic processes that produce damage to joints and articular cartilage are being examined in experimental models . Possible approaches to protecting cartilage from dam - age and inducing cartilage repair are being studied as a means to restore articular surfaces damaged by trauma or osteoar - thritis . The role of bone in the development and progression of osteoarthritis is controversial . Several of our recent studies have suggested that bone may play a critical role . (Williams, Sumner, Thorp) 231 Movement Disorders The faculty investigator and a team of collaborators are investi- gating (1) balance, gait and functional mobility deficits in neuro-degenerative disorders as well as the identification of potential functional markers for early detection of such disorders, and (2) novel technologies to measure hyperactive motion including repetitive, stereotyped movements in individuals with fragile X syndrome and autism as potential outcome measures in future therapeutic intervention trials . (O'Keefe) Cartilage Biology and Bone Growth The long-term goals of this research area is to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern chondrocyte maturation (hypertrophy) during skeletal development, and to identify putative therapeutic targets that regulate chondrocyte matura-tion and are therefore involved in the pathogenesis of related skeletal dysplasias and/or osteoarthritis . Current projects are focused on identification of transcriptional determinants that mediate tissue-specific mouse Col10a1 expression in other transcription late endochondral bone formation . (Zheng) Ocular Lens The structural basis of lens opacification (cataract), lens struc-ture/function relationships as a consequence of aging, cataract formation and ocular/systemic diseases and fiber cell elonga-tion/migration in normal lens and models of cataract are being investigated . (Al-Ghoul) Cancer Research Dissemination of cancer cells from primary tumor to distal organs (e .g ., bone, lungs) is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths . A compelling and therapeutically relevant question is how cancer cells acquire a metastatic phenotype and escape from the primary tumor . Research interests focus on the under - standing the role of transcriptional regulatory networks opera-tive during cancer progression and metastasis to bone using various approaches (molecular, biochemical and imaging), and in vitro and in vivo models of cancer metastasis . (Pratap) Cancer stem cells are highly metastatic and play a key role in tumor recurrence and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy . Cross-talk between the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, heparanase, and PI-3 kinase signaling pathway is implicated in promoting cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumor cell invasive- ness . Studies in the Xu laboratory focus on identifying the role of these signaling pathways in tumorigenesis and metastasis of thyroid and breast cancer and targeting these signaling path- ways for cancer treatment and prevention . (Xu)Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone cancer in children . Current treatment includes aggressive preoperative and postoperative multidrug chemotherapy . Nonetheless, it is estimated that 30% of patients with localized disease and 80% of patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis will relapse . Recurrent tumors are thought to arise from therapy-resistant cancer cells that survive the initial treatment . Determining the molecular basis for chemotherapy resistance should allow one to more effectively target these therapy resistant cells . T he tumor suppressor protein p53 is activated and triggers cell death pathways in response to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs . More than 50% of cancers harbor inactivating mutations in p53, and in many cases mutations in p53 have been linked to a diminished response to chemotherapy . A long-term goal in the Maki lab is to identify molecular mechanisms responsible for therapy resistance in osteosarcoma and other cancers, and then use this information to more effectively target resistant cells . (Maki) Biochemistry Note for the Current Academic Year: Incoming PhD students should refer to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences section of this catalog. The following information is intended for incoming MS students, current MS and current PhD students. Questions about the future plans should be directed to the program director. Biochemistry: Philosophy/Division Overview The Division of Biochemistry offers master's (MS) and doctoral (PhD) degrees with a major in biochemistry . All recipients of these degrees acquire a thorough knowledge of normal biochemical processes that take place in the human organism, leading to the development of knowledge and skills of potential benefit to health care delivery . T he doctoral degree is awarded following the successful defense of a research dissertation, which demonstrates the ability of the student to perform and present original scientific work . Prior to this, the student must have completed all course requirements with a minimum aver - age grade of \"B\" (3 .0/4 .0) and passed the PhD preliminary examination . The goals of the graduate program in the Division of Biochemistry are to provide high-quality education, practical training and research opportunities to students interested in practicing basic and applied medical biochemistry at molecular 232 and cellular levels . T he term medical biochemistry has often been applied to describe the division's scholarly direction . T he division thus endeavors to develop those professionals who, through their research activities, will substantially improve health care delivery to the public . T he program trains students in the appli - cation of chemical, physical and molecular biological methods and principles to the solution of biological problems, especially those of biomedical importance . A gr aduate of the biochemistry program should have the knowledge, skills, perspectives and understanding to produce quality, self-directed scientific work . Since it is a time of enormous and rapid advances in biochem-istry and molecular biology, the knowledge and skills taught in the program are soon replaced or augmented . T hus, the Division of Biochemistry endeavors to train the student to recognize and utilize the interaction between observation, experiment and theory . Most importantly, the candidate should also demonstrate that oral, written and visual communication skills have been acquired . Biochemistry: Admission Requirements Students are admitted only in the fall semester . Applications may be submitted at any time during the year . Application review begins in early winter, and the number of doctoral stipends is limited . Applications for admission to the program will be evaluated by the Graduate Program Committee of the Division of Biochemistry and, in special cases, the Graduate College Council . Applicants are encouraged to visit Rush University for an interview . Consideration for admission will include over all academic record, results of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), letters of recommendation and especially interview results . Students must meet all Graduate College requirements . Medical students seeking an MS or PhD in biochemistry must take a leave of absence from medical school and be formally accepted to the applicable program in the Graduate College . Transfer students with an advanced degree in science may, upon the recommendation of the Graduate Program Committee, be admitted to the graduate program in biochemistry with advanced standing . T he extent of advanced credit will be deter - mined by the Graduate Program Committee on an individual basis through its credentials subcommittee . All adv anced level entrants are urged to see the credentials subcommittee before matriculation . Minimum requirements for admission to the graduate program include a bachelor's degree in any scientific discipline with a minimum grade point average (GPA) and GRE scores as defined by the Graduate College . More specific departmental course requirements are as follows: one year of general chemistry, one year of organic chemistry, one semester or quarter of analytical chemistry or physical chemistry, one year of general biology, one year of molecular, cellular or advanced biology, mathematics through calculus and one year of physics . At least one semes - ter of biochemistry is highly recommended but not required . Students may be accepted with less than the minimum course requirements upon special action of the Graduate Program Committee, which may waive such requirements or require that the deficiency be rectified during the student's first year of graduate study . Biochemistry: Curriculum The PhD degree is a research degree conferred in recognition of proficiency in research, breadth and soundness of scholarship and a thorough acquaintance with a specific field of knowledge as determined by the faculty . T o attain these goals, the curricu - lum includes the following: Graduate College core curriculum courses (GCC courses), which provide a common knowledge base in molecular and cell biology for most graduate students in all divisions A core of required biochemistry courses (BCH courses), which provide the basis for the students to pursue their own spe-cialized biochemistry research programs A variety of elective courses, which provide the students with the flexibility to tailor their coursework to their research interests or needs Initiation of research as soon as possible in the student's first academic year During the first year, the student will complete all required bio- chemistry and Graduate College core curriculum courses . By the end of the second year, the elective course requirements should be completed . At the end of the summer term of the student's first academic year (usually at the beginning of September; the academic year begins with the fall semester), the student sits for the preliminary examination, which is a combination of a written examination, a take-home examination and an oral examina- tion . By the end of his or her second academic year (i .e ., before the fall semester of the student's third academic year begins), the student is required to submit and defend a written dis-sertation proposal before the student's Dissertation Advisory Committee . Following this, the successful student continues his or her research work, as approved by the Dissertation Advisory Committee . 233 When the student's advisor and his or her Dissertation Advisory Committee agree that the student has completed his or her task, which is evaluated at an announced \"Permission to Write Meeting,\" he or she writes a dissertation, which is defended in a public seminar and in a separate executive session with the student's Dissertation Examination Committee . Another require - ment is that one or more manuscripts, based on the student's dissertation work, be published, accepted or submitted for publi-cation in a full-length peer-reviewed journal, with the student listed as first author . T o participate in the May commencement ceremony, all requirements for the PhD degree must be met by the beginning of the month . Required Formal Courses for the PhD Degree Any portion of this may be waived for advanced students on a case-by-case basis as recommended by the Credentials Subcommittee . Semester Hours Required Total credit hours required for full-time student status and for graduation are determined by the Graduate College . T he student must check with the Office of the Registrar before anticipated graduation as to whether or not all formal Graduate College requirements have been met . A full-time student registers for a minimum of 12, 10, or 9 credit hours each semester depending on the semester . Credit hours not allocated to formal courses are made up by BCH-699, Biochemistry Doctoral Research, for PhD students or BCH-598, Biochemistry Master Research, for MS students . A student, how - ever, should register for at least one BCH-699 or BCH-598 credit each semester even though the student may not have begun laboratory research . A student not taking any formal courses must register for enough hours in BCH-699 or BCH-598 to be a full-time student . T he seven elective hours may be selected from other courses offered by the Division of Biochemistry or from coursework offered by other divisions, including those of other universities . Electives can be taken only after consultation with the student's advisor and the Director of Graduate Education and final approval by the director . Most required courses taken by the student must carry a letter grade (\"A,\" \"B,\" Journal Club, credits are taken for a pass/ no pass grade . Students must obtain a grade of \"B\" or better in BCH-571, which is considered the biochemistry core course . Elective courses may be taken for a letter grade or a pass/no pass grade . Graduate students must maintain at least a \"B\" aver - age (3 .0) to remain in good academic standing in the Graduate College . The department's seminar program and the weekly workshops are to be considered as part of a student's research experience . Attendance at seminars is mandatory throughout the entire graduate study at Rush . Attendance at the workshops is highly recommended since these sessions can greatly help a stu- dent prepare for and conduct the dissertation work . Since many of the themes presented at the workshops relate to dissertation projects, students may be queried as to their knowledge of semi-nar and workshop presentations at their preliminary examination or their dissertation progress meetings . Suggested Program A suggested program for the PhD student is displayed herein . Please note that all required courses are to be taken in the first and second years of the student's tenure at Rush University . Electives are normally taken during the second year . A research advisor should be selected by the end of the second semester of the student's first year, or earlier . Students are expected to remain on campus during the summer term as full-time students taking BCH-699 (unless taking a formal course) . T he summer term pro - vides a welcomed opportunity to do uninterrupted research work . Reasonable vacation time is permitted after consultation with the student's advisor and two weeks are allowed annually, accord- ing to NIH fellowship guidelines . T he program of study for MS students is similar to that for PhD students except that master's students register for BCH-598, Biochemistry Master's Research, 3 BCH-581 I 3 BCH-582 Biomedical Methodology II 3 BCH-595 Journal Club 1 (per year) BCH-624 Connective T issue Biochemistry 2 BCH-698 Introduction to Molecular to Proteome 2 GCC-502 Cellular Biochemistry: Proteins , 2 Transport and Signaling GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-504 Functional Tissue Biology 2 GCC-506 Research Ethics 1 GCC-508 Writing Practicum 2 GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology 1 GCC-512 Readings in Cellular Biochemistry 1 GCC-513 Readings in Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-514 Readings in Functional T issue Biology 1 Electives 7 Research (BCH-699 or -598) 11 Total Hours of Required Coursework, less BCH-595 hours: 45 234 Biochemistry: Academic Policies Statute of Limitations and Leaves of Absence A student must complete his or her PhD degree requirements within five years of matriculating to Rush in the Department of Biochemistry, excluding any leaves of absence . Extensions of this limitation may be granted under unusual circumstances on a semester-by-semester basis upon petition to the Director of Educational Programs, who will act based on the advice of the Graduate Program Committee . Extramural Experience Selected students will have an opportunity to spend one semester in a basic science research laboratory in an industrial organization or another recognized research institution of higher learning in the United States or Europe . It is expected that work in the extramural laboratory will aid the student in his or her dissertation research work . T he students will be selected for this experience upon written application to the Director of Graduate Education through guidelines established by the Division . Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to the Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog . In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies . Biochemistry: Tuition Waivers/Stipends The Graduate College determines tuition for full-time graduate students; however, tuition has historically been waived for stu- dents in a PhD program . Students in an MS program pay tuition . Most PhD students receive a research scholarship (stipend), while MS students do not . T he research scholarship awarded to PhD students is a privilege, which is contingent upon satisfac- tory academic progress on the part of the student . No special application for this stipend need be made; the applicant must merely indicate in his or her cover letter that such a stipend is desired . Additional financial aid, including loans, is available through the Rush University Office of Student Financial Aid . It should be noted that the student is expected to be a full-time student . Part-time jobs are highly discouraged . T he advisor (who will then inform the Director of Graduate Education in writ-ing) must approve any special circumstances that necessitate a part-time job . It is intended that graduate students receive their stipends from the Division of Biochemistry until the student has passed his or her Preliminary Examination and, at the end of Suggested Program of Study for PhD Students instead of BCH-699 . Master's students do not tak e a prelimi - nary examination . T he MS program should be completed in two years, where the first year is devoted primarily to coursework and the second year to MS research .

T he following information is intended for incoming MS, current MS and current PhD students . Questions about the future plans should be directed to the program director . Biomechanics: Philosophy The Master of Science in Biomechanics program is designed to educate bioengineers in a clinical setting who will participate in the conduct of research to improve orthopedic care . Graduates of this program can collaborate with other researchers to perform high-quality, up-to-date research in orthopedic biome-chanics at colleges and universities, government agencies and orthopedic-related industries . Graduates can also use this as a stepping stone towards obtaining a PhD degree in biomechan-ics after gaining appreciable practical experience either in the orthopedic industry or research institutions conducting high- quality musculoskeletal biomechanics research . Students in the program will work with faculty and scientists from different divi-sions at Rush University such as the Divisions of Biomechanics, Biochemistry, Anatomy, Physiology and Molecular Biophysics to learn essential skills in research methods, data analysis and descriptive and inferential statistics applied to the biological and engineering aspects of musculoskeletal biomechanics . T he pro - gram of study involves formal courses in biomechanics, bioma - terials, anatomy, tissue and cell biology, research methods and biostatistics . As a part of the program, students must complete a research project that culminates in a thesis . Specific objectives of the program are to: 1) train bioengineers in the application of biomechanics to clinically related musculo-skeletal problems through \"bench to bedside and back again\" research that improves orthopedic care; 2) provide bioengineers with core competencies needed for the design and analysis of clinical biomechanical problems in the field of orthopedics; and 3) provide bioengineers the foundation that is needed to assume professional leadership roles in a variety of settings for research and design in the area of orthopedic biomechanics . The master's degree is very much a viable diploma, independent of the PhD qualification . Local industry leaders and employers have reported through interviews with faculty in our Graduate College that they have a greater need for MS-prepared individu- als to work in their laboratories . Graduates of the master' s pro- gram will be qualified to work in orthopedic-related industries, hospitals, government and nonprofit agencies to assist in the design of biomechanical devices and evaluate their effectiveness . MS graduates are more likely to assume positions in industry .the first academic year, has selected a permanent advisor . From that time on, it will be the obligation of the student's advisor to provide the student with financial support, including a stipend, from his or her extramural research funds as the student can now devote more time to research . The research scholarship (stipend) is awarded to students for a period of five years with the understanding that they will devote their full time to graduate study activities and that they will make satisfactory progress toward the PhD degree . \"Satisfactory progress\" includes, but is not limited to, pursuit of the prescribed didactic course program, identification of a research advisor by the end of the second semester, passing the preliminary examination in the fall of their second academic year, presenting a research proposal by the end of the second academic year as specified by departmental rules and regula-tions, and pursuing research activities toward the student's dissertation with due diligence and effort . T he Graduate College has mandated that the PhD must be awarded within seven years following matriculation . However, the Division of Biochemistry will enforce a five-year deadline, but will allow extensions that are justified and approved by the Graduate Program Committee . Biochemistry: Research Interests Members of the Division of Biochemistry's faculty conduct a broad range of extramurally funded research activities . Many faculty members focus their research efforts on cartilage tissues, synovial joints and arthritic diseases . A strong inter action exists between practicing clinicians and members of the Division of Biochemistry, and sometimes leads to a full consolidation of research programs . T he diverse interests of the faculty provide investigative expertise in the areas of connective tissue bio-chemistry, etiology of arthritis, animal models of arthritis, joint imaging, regulation of gene expression, cytokines and growth factors, signal transduction, biomechanics, tribology, muscu-loskeletal cell biology, cancer cell biology, cell membrane and lipid biochemistry and the application of clinical biochemistry to medical problems . Some of these research programs are joint efforts with other departments, giving the student an oppor - tunity to interact with investigators in other disciplines as well as with clinicians and physician scientists . T he departmental laboratories are fully equipped with instrumentation required for modern research in biochemistry, tissue culture and molecular biology . 236 Biomechanics: Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester in order to begin the required coursework in the core curriculum . T he deadline for submission of applications is generally March 1 . International applications can be accepted after March 1 but must take into consideration the delays associated with the necessary visa arrangements . In addition to the basic require - ments established by the Graduate College, the division has the following requirements for admission to its program: Applicants must have completed a baccalaureate degree or higher from a regionally accredited college or university and provide official transcripts from each college or university attended . Prior degrees would most likely include physical sciences, engineering, computer science, mathematics, biol-ogy or medicine, although students with degrees from other areas and those who consider themselves to have special or unique qualities and a reasonable likelihood of success are also encouraged to apply . The Graduate College requires academic transcripts from all baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate educational experi- ences . These should provide a minimal grade point average of 3 .0 overall (A = 4 .0) . T he Graduate College requires all graduate students to take the GRE examinations; scores on these tests are considered by the admission committee . All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) . Applicants from foreign countries must have their transcripts evaluated by an independent agency (i .e ., ECE and WES) . As required by the Graduate College , a clear, concise expression of the applicant's interests and goals needs to be included as an essay in the application . Identifying a par - ticular area of interest within the field of biomechanics is very helpful in identifying potential laboratories for the students . The Graduate College requires three letters of recommen - dation, and it is recommended that they be from science faculty who can evaluate the character of the applicant, the applicant's academic and research performance, and the applicant's ability to think and work independently . The division director and the Admissions Committee evalu- ate applications . All prior academic experience and the letters of recommendation will be evaluated for an indication of the applicant's potential for success as a graduate student and future independent investigator . T he statement by the applicant describing goals and motivation will be studied to determine the compatibility between the applicant's requirements and the capabilities of the graduate program .The number of faculty available to mentor the student's research limits acceptance into the master's program . Students are there - fore encouraged to apply early . Generally , students entering the master's program will not be eligible for stipends and must pay tuition . Under certain circumstances, if the faculty has sufficient funds, it may provide financial support to the extent of tuition . Biomechanics: Curriculum When the applicant enters the program, a research advisor is assigned and the student begins directed research on an active project . In the first three semesters, there is minimal research as classroom studies are emphasized . During these semesters, master's Graduate College students take the Graduate Core Curriculum (GCC) classes, required biochemistry (BCH) courses and required biomechanics (BMC) courses . T he summer semester is devoted to MS thesis research . Research and advanced biome - chanics courses provide the core of the second-year studies . T he master's students are involved in a directed research project . A typical course sequence is described as follows: Year 1 Fall Semester BMC-501 Statics and Dynamics 3 BMC-502 Strength & Properties of Materials 3 BMC-505 Anatomy/Musculoskeletal System 3 GCC-502 Cellular Biochemistry 2 GCC-512 Reading Biochemistry 1 Spring Semester BMC-511 Biomechanics 3 BMC-513 Kinematics of Human Motion 3 BMC-512 Bioengineering Material 3 GCC-506 Research Ethics 1 BCH-624 Connective Tissue Biochemistry 2 Summer Semester BMC-503 Introduction to Research 1 BMC-504 Journal Club 1 BMC-521 MS Thesis 7 Year 2 Fall Semester BMC-514 Spine Biomechanics 3 GCC-546 Statistics 2 BMC-521 MS Thesis 7 Spring Semester BMC-521 MS Thesis 6 GCC-508 Writing Practicum 2237 GCC courses are Graduate College courses taken by master's students from a variety of different Graduate College programs . These courses provide a basic understanding of the biomedi- cal sciences and acquaint the students with the biomedical literature . BCH-prefixed courses are specific to the Division of Biochemistry . BMC-prefixed courses are specific to the Division of Biomechanics . The Division of Biomechanics reserves the right to revise courses, and the student may be required to take the replacement courses . Such a requirement would not apply to students who have already taken a course . Minimal Credit Hours Required for MS Degree The MS program in biomechanics will require a minimum of 53 semester hours of academic coursework taken at the graduate level that consists of core courses in biomechanics, strength and properties of biomaterials, basic anatomy and cellular biochem-istry (15 semester hours); research core courses in biostatistics, writing practicum, ethics and journal club and introduction to research (7 semester hours); professional track courses in connective tissue biochemistry, kinematics of human motion, bioengineering material and spine biomechanics (11 semester hours); and thesis work (20 semester hours) . T he program may be completed in approximately 2 years of full-time study . Research Requirements (Thesis) All MS students must complete a thesis as a part of the degree completion requirements . T he thesis is completed through faculty-guided research . T he thesis may be original or an important extension of an existing theory/principle and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or at any other university . Each student will have a thesis committee whose role is to assure that the student's thesis is of high quality and meets the standards of the division, the college and the University . T he thesis committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least three total members to include the student's primary advisor . T he primary advisor must be a member of the Graduate College . Once the committee con - venes, it will choose a chairperson, who cannot be the student's primary advisor . T he chairperson will oversee the scheduling and activities of the committee . Biomechanics: Thesis Program Progression During the summer of the first year, the student selects a research project in conjunction with a faculty mentor . T he research project is designed to advance knowledge in a specific discipline and to yield a scientific publication for the student . The thesis may be original or an important extension of an existing theory/principle and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or at any other university . Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The graduate division director functions as the academic advisor to the student during the first year . T he program director deter - mines the course schedule and monitors the student's progress . In the summer, a principal advisor or mentor is selected from the faculty of the Division of Biomechanics . T he advisor then accepts the supervisory role in the development of the student as a scientific investigator . Thesis Research The advisor will work with the student to develop a research project that can be completed within the framework of the program . Each student will have a thesis committee whose role is to assure that the student's thesis is of high quality and meets the standards of the division, the college and the University . The thesis committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least three total members to include the student's primary advisor . The primary advisor must be a member of the Graduate College . Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson, who cannot be the student's primary advisor . T he chairperson will oversee the scheduling and activities of the committee . Master's Thesis A written thesis, describing work accomplished, is required to be completed by all master's students by the end of the second year . The thesis committee reviews the thesis . At or near the completion of the thesis, each student will share, by means of a seminar with the academic community, the knowledge that the student has developed . Students are responsible for posting announcements (at least two weeks prior to the presentation) on institutional bulletin boards and emailing all faculty and students of the Graduate College the title of the thesis; the student's name; and the location, date and time of the presenta- tion . This presentation must precede the final approval of the written thesis by the thesis committee . Following the approv al of the thesis committee, the program director must certify the completion of the thesis and all requirements for the MS degree . The director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center must then approve the formatting of the thesis before its accep- tance by the Library of Rush University .238 Completion of the Degree The Office of the Registrar must be notified of impending com- pletion of the degree by submission of an Intent to Graduate form at the beginning of the final semester . Information for graduation can be found in the University Catalog . As the thesis is reaching final form, the student should consult with the University Librarian to assure that the thesis will be formatted correctly . Upon thesis approval, the student completes a final checklist to assure the necessary approvals . During this time, the student will be required to have an exit interview and provide the college with feedback concerning his or her experience at Rush University . Biomechanics: Graduation Requirements The student must complete all required courses except for those waived by the Graduate Committee and have completed the minimally required course hours as detailed in the curriculum section . The student's committee must approve the thesis and have the completed document accepted by the graduate pro- gram director and the University librarian .

T he dissertation must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or at any other university . Each student will have a dissertation committee whose role is to assure that the student's dissertation is of high quality and meets the standards of the division, the college and the University for originality, contribution to the field and scholarly presentation . The committee is also to assure that the student is making satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree . The dissertation committee is chosen by the student in conjunc-tion with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least five total members that include the student's primary advisor . Two of the committee members and the primary advisor must be from the Graduate College . At least one member of the committee should be from outside of the division, and preferably from outside of the institution . Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson, who cannot be the student's primary advisor . The chairperson will oversee the scheduling and activi - ties of the committee . Preliminary Examination The PhD-seeking student is expected to attempt and pass a written and an oral examination (referred to as the preliminary examination) WITHIN the second year after admission to the program (summer of the 2nd year) . T he preliminary examination can be from coursework to examine the student's preparedness . The preliminary examination presentation format will closely fol-low that of the NIH grant application but excludes portions such as budget, resource statement, etc . T he student is expected to provide some preliminary results and, more importantly, outline his or her research plan . The preliminary examination committee consists of 5 faculty members (including the advisor and the division director) . Specific requirements for the committee include: 1) at least one Year 1 Fall Semester BMC-501 Statics and Dynamics 3 BMC-502 Strength & Properties of Materials 3 BMC-505 Anatomy/Musculoskeletal System 3 GCC-502 Cellular Biochemistry 2 GCC-512 Reading Biochemistry 1 Spring Semester BMC-511 Biomechanics 3 BMC-513 Kinematics of Human Motion 3 BMC-512 Bioengineering Material 3 GCC-506 Research Ethics 1 BCH-624 Connective Tissue Biochemistry 2 Summer Semester BMC-503 Introduction to Research 1 BMC-504 Journal Club 1 BMC-631 Doctoral Dissertation 7 Year 2 Fall Semester BMC-514 Spine Biomechanics 3 BMC-611 Non-Linear Tissue Mechanics 3 GCC-546 Statistics 2 GCC-505 Introduction to Laboratories 2 BTN-525 Experimental Design and Models of Research 2 Spring Semester BMC-612 Advanced Strength of Materials 3 BMC-613 Implant Biomechanics 3 BMC-614 Bone Biology 3 BMC-615 Advanced 3 GCC-508 Writing Practicum 2 Summer Semester BMC-616 Tribology of Implants 3 BMC-699 Elective 3 BMC-631 Doctoral Dissertation 3 Year 3 and Year 4 BMC-631 Doctoral Dissertation 64241 member from outside the Division of Biomechanics and 2) at least one member from outside of Rush University and approved by the Divisional Graduate Program Committee (which will be formed as a program oversight body) . T he preliminary examination commit - tee will, preferably, remain the same and become the final dis- sertation committee . T he preliminary examination may be open to the academic community of the university . T he committee must approve the research proposal . During the course of the research work, each student must, annu- ally, present his or her findings in a seminar . At or near the completion of the dissertation, each student will share, by means of a seminar with the academic community, the knowledge that the student has developed and the findings obtained . Students are responsible for posting announcements (at least two weeks prior to the presentation) on institutional bulletin boards and emailing all faculty and students of the Graduate College the title of the dissertation, the student's name, and the location, date and time of the presentation . T his presentation must precede the final approval of the written dissertation by the dissertation committee . Upon completion of the public presentation, the student will meet with the dissertation committee to review the presentation, the dissertation document, and the student's preparedness to enter the scientific community . A majority of members of the committee must sign the dissertation certifying the completion of all require- ments for the Doctor of Philosophy degree . Admission to Candidacy for PhD Admission to candidacy is evidence that the doctoral student has successfully completed all preliminary coursework and is prepared to move into his or her intensive research experience . Admission to candidacy is not completed until the student successfully defends his or her dissertation proposal . T his proposal must be in the form of an R21 NIH application . Admission to candidacy is a demonstration of confidence that the student will successfully accomplish the remaining requirements of the program . Practicum, Internship, Clinical or Field Experience Requirements Internship or field experience with reputed implant manufacturers may help PhD students with their dissertation work . Time to Completion of the Degree Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates are expected to meet all requirements for graduation within five enrolled academic years (excluding leaves of absence) . T his period begins the semester in which the student formally matriculates . A student exceeding that time limitation must submit to the Graduate Council, in writing, a request to extend his or her candidacy beyond that time period . This request must identify the reasons for the exten - sion and provide a written plan with reasonable deadlines for completion . This document will be co-signed by the student's advisor, section director and division director . T he council will vote whether to accept the extension or not (passed by simple majority) . The student's advisor will then provide an update on the student's progress after six months . One year after the extension is granted, the student is expected to complete all requirements . A second request may be made by the student' s advisor and section director, but will only be accepted through a two-thirds majority of the voting members present at a formal hearing of the Graduate College Council . Within one year of that second request, the student must complete all requirements for the PhD degree or face dismissal . Alternatively , the student may be awarded an MS degree upon the recommendation of the student's graduate division . Biomechanics: Academic Policies The minimum satisfactory grade for course credit is \"B,\" and all stipulated segments of a course must be passed by this stan- dard . If a student earns grades lower than \"B,\" or the student's overall GPA falls below 3 .0, the student may not be permitted to register for subsequent courses or semesters without the approval of the section Committee on Progress and Promotions, and the student may be subject to probation, suspension or dis- missal from the program . Students who withdraw or have been dismissed from the program may reapply and will be considered on the same basis as a new applicant . Students requesting readmission must submit a letter to that effect to the Committee on Progress and Promotions . Students are expected to attend all classes and spend the appropriate time in the lab . Outside employment is not allowed for anyone receiving a stipend because it interferes with the time and effort necessary to complete the program . Each student is expected to conduct himself or herself at all times in a dignified manner\u2014a manner which conforms to the ethics of the profession and which instills confidence in one's abilities as a working scientist . Irresponsible, unprofessional or unethical behavior, as determined by the instructor, may result in dismissal from the program . The department will not condone cheating in any form . Allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the Committee on Progress and Promotions and, if merited, dealt with in a strict manner including immediate dismissal from the program .242 Any student found to be cheating on an examination will automatically receive a \"0\" for the examination and, at the discretion of the Committee on Progress and Promotions, will be subject to dismissal from the program .

A student in academic difficulty is not eligible for graduation . Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to the Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog . In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies . Biotechnology: Graduation Requirements The successful completion of the biotechnology curriculum with a minimum 3 .0 (on a 4 .0 scale) cumulative GPA will qualify the student for graduation . No thesis or other activity is required . T he Master of Science degree is conferred to biotechnology students .245 Clinical Research: Philosophy The Master of Science program is designed to train health care professionals to undertake and evaluate clinical research . This program is part of the Graduate College . T he two-year, thesis-requiring program involves one year of didactic lectures scheduled in late afternoon followed by a one-year, mentored clinical research experience . Both years are designed to provide the necessary skills needed to perform clinical research in the 21st century . The coursework covers experimental design and historically important clinical trials, as well as clinical research with a faculty mentor . Skills and techniques needed for epide - miology, outcomes and clinical pharmacology research are also provided . The emphasis of the program is to make available the skills needed for successful undertaking and completion of an independent clinical research project . Clinical Research: Admission Requirements This program is targeted to health care professionals with advanced degrees including MD, PhD or PharmD degrees . Students with other advanced degrees including nursing and pharmacy degrees and experience in clinical trials may also apply; however, an advanced degree is not required . Many students in the program are physicians in fellowship programs at Rush University Medical Center and the John H . Stroger, Jr . Hospital of Cook County . Students seeking admission to the Master of Science in Clinical Research program must complete an application and provide formal transcripts from all institu- tions of higher education that were previously attended . T he deadline for application is generally June 30, although excep- tions can be made . Applicants must enter the progr am in the fall semester, which starts in early September . T he majority of stu - dents applying to this program are current health professionals, and if an advanced health professional degree is documented, no entrance examination is required . If the applicant does not hold a professional degree, the GRE must be taken . If evidence of performance in the 50th percentile in national examinations (e .g ., MCAT or DAT) is provided, the GRE requirements can be waived . Applications will be reviewed by the program director, and students will be notified when they are accepted .Clinical Research: Curriculum The curriculum for the program is single track the first year and self-directed the second year . All students in the progr am are required to maintain a cumulative average of \"B\" or greater (or pass) . Courses offered are graded in year one as either pass/ no pass or with a letter grade .

Note for CRE-597 Thesis Research, credits can be taken in varying hours from 0-9.246 Students are required to take the readings courses in the second year, although students may also take other electives in topics dealing with Clinical Trials, Outcomes/Epidemiology Research or Clinical Pharmacology . Classes are tailored to the specific needs of the student and are arranged through the program director . The students will also meet periodically with the program direc-tor during the second year to monitor progress on their master's thesis research project . A student who fails a class or receives a no-pass in a course will have an opportunity to retake the exam or rewrite the paper to reverse the no-pass grade . A cumulative aver age of \"B\" or greater (pass) in required courses is needed to continue in the program . Failure to remediate the no-pass grade will automati - cally require the program director to review the student's status and officially place the student on academic probation for a period of one semester . T he course director will develop a reme - diation plan to ensure the student has mastery of the subject area covered . Required courses are GCC 551, 552, 546, 553; CRE 557, 558; and PHR 556 . The second year is designed to provide an intense mentored clinical research project under a mentor's guidance and the preparation of a master's thesis . Students usually enroll in at least six credit hours per semester . T hese are typically research hours (CRE-597) or elective readings classes . T he student and mentor will identify a clinical research project and will submit that project in the form of an abstract by the end of the spring semester of year 1 . T he student and mentor will further refine the proposal in the summer between the first and second year . Only clinical projects will be considered for this program . T he student is expected to complete all of the data collection by the beginning of the spring semester for submission of the thesis by the end of the spring semester of the second year . Minimum Credit Hours Required Successful completion of the clinical research program requires 32 semester hours as a minimum for graduation along with preparation and public defense of a written thesis . Students may opt to take additional hours and can enroll in mentoring intern- ships for up to 9 credit hours per semester . T his option places the student in a clinical or laboratory environment 10 hours per week, performing research with a clinical research scientist, enabling a 9-credit hour per semester experience .Clinical Research: Thesis Process After identifying a mentor, the student and mentor will begin to outline the research project during the spring and summer of the first year . T his can be of the student's own design or, alternatively, a student may participate in a large multicentered trial provided permission is received in advance for publication of the subset of that data collected by the student as a thesis . Any project that involves patient-oriented research (requires IRB approval, or involves a systematic review of patient data) can be submitted . By midterm of the spring semester the student can submit the project in the form of a scientific abstract with anticipated methods, statistical analyses, power analysis and outcomes, or present an oral abstract . T he program director must approve the abstract . Once approved, an IRB application can be submitted . The student will be encouraged to write a first-author manu-script summarizing his or her work and submit that manuscript for review . This manuscript can then be modified to meet the University standards for thesis submission and serve as the thesis . If a manuscript is not written and submitted, the student must still present a written thesis for consideration for degree completion . All students will present their work publicly in May prior to graduation . T he mentor and program director sign the completed thesis document suggesting that a majority of the committee has accepted the thesis . T here are no written or oral qualifying exams for the program . Clinical Research: Academic Policies For a student to remain in good standing, the Graduate College requires that the student have a passing (\"B\" or higher) cumu- lative average for all required coursework . For this purpose a \"P\" will count as a \"B\" for grade averaging . Students are expected to attend all classes and participate in discussion . Students are also expected to participate in the various computer laboratories that are routinely held in the McCormick Educational Technology Center (METC) throughout the first year of the program . Students are expected to conduct themselves in a profes- sional manner . T his includes respecting the rights of others and being kind and courteous to students, faculty/staff and patients . Intimidation of other students and faculty/staff will not be tolerated and is grounds for dismissal . Sexual harassment as well as harassment related to race, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or parental 247 status, or disability is prohibited . T he University Bulletin details the policies regarding inclusion of minorities and those with disabilities as well as the policies and procedures for reporting harassment . The Graduate College understands that many of the students are clinicians, but it does expect for them to be on call during class time (generally 3:30 to 6:30 p .m . on T uesdays and Thursdays) . The Master of Science in Clinical Research program follows the University Policies on Academic Honesty and the University Statement on Student Conduct . Student Grievance Procedure Numerous checks are in place to assure the fair treatment of students . However, if a grievance does evolve, the student should speak with the program director first in an attempt to resolve the problem . If this is unsuccessful or the grievance involves the program director, the student's grievance can be appealed to the Dean of the college .

T he schedule for these classes is: Immunology/Microbiology Note for the Current Academic Year: Incoming PhD students should refer to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences section of this catalog. The following information is intended for incoming MS, current MS and cur - rent PhD students. Questions about the future plans should be directed to the program director. Immunology/Microbiology: Philosophy The Division of Immunology/Microbiology is committed to educating bright, creative individuals for careers in scientific investigation . T he training is accomplished through faculty-led instruction in the classroom, independent self-study, laboratory rotations and intensive dissertation research under the direc- tion of a mentor and student dissertation advisory committee . It is expected that students completing the PhD program will be skilled in the scientific method, will be capable of independent critical thinking, will be skilled as life-long learners and, with additional postdoctoral training, will become leaders in their chosen field . The division also offers a more limited educational program leading to the MS degree . Immunology/Microbiology: Admission Requirements Students who have received a baccalaureate degree in biologi- cal sciences or a related field may apply for the master's or the doctoral program . Candidates usually enter the program in the fall semester . Applications should be submitted by February 15 and no later than June 30 . Applications will be ev aluated by the Departmental Admissions Committee as they are received . It is possible that applications will be closed before June 30 if the class is filled before that date . Considerations for admission will include overall academic record, the recommendations of the sponsors, results of a recent Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the description of the applicant's own aspirations and interests . International students are also required to submit a recent result of a TOEFL test . Admission criteria to the program are consistent with the general requirements of the Graduate College . A gr ade point average of at least 3 .0 on a 4 .0 scale as well as competitive GRE and TOEFL scores are required . Minimum GRE or T OEFL scores are not assigned . In rare circumstances, students that do not fulfill these require-ments may be accepted at the discretion of the division and the Graduate College Council . Personal interviews will be arr anged for potential candidates after the preliminary review . Students will be admitted into the program at levels other than first year only under exceptional circumstances; this will require approval Year 1 Fall Semester I GCC-501 Molecular Biology: Genome to Proteome 2 GCC-502 Cellular Biochemistry: Proteins , 2 Transport and Signaling GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology 1 GCC-512 Readings in Cellular Biochemistry 1 IMM-507 Basic Immunology I 1 IMM-520 Advanced Readings in Immunology 1 and Microbiology IMM-515 Research Seminar 1 IMM-600 Laboratory Rotations 1 Spring Semester GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-504 Functional Tissue Biology 2 GCC-506 Biomedical Ethics 1 GCC-513 Readings in Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-514 Readings in Functional T issue Biology 1 IMM-508 Basic Immunology II 1 IMM-520 Advanced Readings in Immunology 1 and Microbiology IMM-515 Research Seminar 1 IMM-600 Laboratory Rotations 1 Summer Semester IMM-615 Pre-Dissertation Research 12 (A pre-candidacy examination for doctoral candidates\u2014described below) 252 Before the start of the fall semester, the student will select a laboratory and advisor for the dissertation research . T he student and advisor will submit a list of faculty for the Student Dissertation Advisory Committee (SDAC) for approval by the GAC . The members of the SDAC will be allowed to change with GAC approval if the project changes substantially or if the faculty is no longer appointed at Rush . T he composition of the SDAC must be consistent with guidelines of the Graduate College Council . At this time , the SDAC must consist of at least five members: The advisor Two faculty members from the Division of Immunology/ Microbiology . T his may include a co-advisor . One faculty member from another division in the Graduate College An additional faculty member from within or from outside of Rush University The student will prepare a dissertation proposal describing his or her plan for dissertation research and submit the proposal to his or her SDAC during the spring or summer semester of the second year . The SDAC must approve both the written document and oral defense of the document before the end of the summer semester . Preliminary data should be included, if av ailable, but are not necessary and the presentation/defense should not be deferred to collect such data . While it is mandatory that students complete this requirement by the end of the summer semester, students are strongly urged to complete this requirement before this deadline so that they may begin their doctoral dissertation research in earnest as soon as possible . After successful defense of the research proposal and the dissertation proposal, the student will be admitted to candidacy . If the proposal defense is failed, the SDAC may require that the proposal be rewritten and defended prior to the end of the fall semester of the third year . A failure at the second defense will result in a recommendation for dismissal from the program . Three to Five Years to Completion of the Program Students should continue to register for Special Topic (IMM-610) courses from years 2 through 4 until they have completed two special topic courses prior to graduation . In special circum - stances, students may substitute special topic courses with an elective, contingent upon permission of the graduate program director . Doctoral students are expected to register for IMM-520: Advanced Readings in Immunology and Microbiology, IMM-515: Research Seminar and IMM-620: Dissertation Research each fall and spring semester . Examples of previous special topics courses include Current Topics in Cellular Immunology \u2014 From Bedside Students in the PhD track must complete the requirement for a pre-candidacy examination (PCE) by the end of the summer semester . The PCE consists of both a written and oral portion . The written portion is based on a research proposal submitted to an examination committee appointed by the Graduate Advisory Committee (GAC) . T he topic of research must be preapproved by the GAC and must be different from the proposed research for PhD dissertation . T he proposal should be based on the NIH R21 grant application format and should be no more than 7 pages in length (single-spaced) excluding bibliography . T he oral portion of the PCE will consist of a presentation and defense of the grant proposal and may also include basic questions in their area of interest (immunology/microbiology) . Students who fail the PCE will be asked to take a comprehensive written examination in immunology and microbiology . Failing this comprehensive writ - ten examination will result in recommendation for dismissal by the GAC to the Dean of the Graduate College . Students are also expected to devote substantial time to research during the summer semester . After all core courses are completed, a student will be evaluated by the GAC for his or her performance in courses, laboratory work, motivation, etc ., to determine continuation of the student in the program . This evaluation will take place before the beginning of the fall semester of the second year . Second Year to Completion of the Program The classes required during the second year are: Year 2 Fall Semester I IMM-510 Advan ced Immunology 4 IMM-515 Research Seminar 1 IMM-520 Advanced Readings in Immunology 1 and Microbiology IMM-615 Pre-Dissertation Research 6 Spring Semester IMM-610 Special T opics (total of two required) 2 IMM-515 Research Seminar 1 IMM-520 Advanced Readings in Immunology 1 and Microbiology IMM-615 Pre-Dissertation Research 6 Summer Semester IMM-615 Pre-Dissertation Research 12 PhD students should defend a dissertation proposal to move to candidacy . 253 to Bench; HIV Gene Structure and Function; Signal and Th2, Parasites, and Allergy . Students must also devote maximum time to research during these years . When the student and the advisor have determined that suffi-cient data have been obtained and that the project has reached an acceptable degree of completion, a data defense meeting with the SDAC is held in which the student summarizes the data that will be included in the dissertation . If the SDAC approves , the student will commence writing the dissertation . A require - ment for graduation is an accepted first-author publication in a peer-reviewed journal based on the student's dissertation research . Curriculum for Students in the Master's Track Students in the master's track are required to take the same first year of classes as the doctoral students . After the completion of first year, students in the master's track are required to submit a topic of research for approval by the GAC by the summer semes- ter of the first year . After approv al, the student is expected to pursue full-time research in this area, while continuing to regis-ter for Research Seminar and Advanced Readings in Immunology and Microbiology . Students need to form a research committee made up of their advisor and two faculty members within the Graduate College . T hey are expected to summarize their findings in the format of a manuscript and defend it orally to their com- mittee members in an open defense . It is expected that the MS degree will be completed within two years of matriculation . Immunology/Microbiology: Academic Policies Five-Year-Rule Limit after Matriculation The Division of Immunology/Microbiology honors the five-year- rule limit after matriculation stated by the Graduate College . T he rule states that \"Maximum enrollment for degree completion is five calendar years . Any approved leave of absence will be excluded from this time . A student may petition for an exten - sion of the overall time limit to the division director . If such an extension is granted, the student will be expected to enroll full-time for each remaining semester in residence . If a student proposes to maintain active status in the Graduate College while at another location, approval by the division director and the Graduate College Council will be necessary . Such a student will enroll each semester with Rush University's Office of the Registrar for zero hours of credit, and will be charged the enroll- ment fee rate in effect at that time .\" Vacation Students are entitled a total of two weeks of vacation per year . The advisor must approve the vacation timing . Parental Leave Policy Parental leave will first be negotiated between student and advisor, subject to the provision that students may take up to six weeks (total) off during pregnancy and/or following the birth of a baby, with full stipend . If a student elects to take a longer period before returning to full-time graduate status, this addi-tional time will be automatically considered a leave of absence with no stipend provided . A student on paternity/maternity leave of absence is guaranteed reinstatement for up to six months after delivery . Conditions for Continuation in the Program If a student leaves residency in the program without completing the requirements of his or her degree, he or she may continue his or her status as a student for an additional two years, provided he or she arranges to meet the SDAC every six months . Otherwise, the student will be subject to dismissal at the end of six months after leaving the program . Ethics All students are expected to keep a good and careful record of their research . Any student found falsifying, plagiarizing or misrepresenting data will be dismissed from the program . T he original of all records must remain in the laboratory in which the student worked . Problems Between Advisor and Student Prior to forming the SDAC, if a problem arises between student and advisor, this problem should be discussed with the Division Director, who will then attempt to mediate and provide a rea- sonable solution to the problem . If a problem arises between a student and the advisor after the student has formed the SDAC, the student and/or the advisor should discuss the problem with the SDAC chair . If the problem is not resolved within one month, the student/advisor should discuss it with the Division Director . It is recommended that difficulties be solved at an early stage . If the informal approaches are unsuccessful, and a student and/or advisor desires to sever their working relationship, those indi-viduals involved shall petition in writing for such change to the program director . From the date of receipt of the written request for a change, two weeks of mutual introspection time is required before any change is considered . T he Division Director will make the decision whether or not to honor the student's request for transfer and will make the necessary arrangements to make the 254 transition smoothly . An advisor change is a serious matter and should only be contemplated after all other avenues have failed . Students must also be aware that an advisor change is not automatically approved, and that the availability of an alternate advisor may be very restricted .

In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies . Immunology/Microbiology: Tuition Waivers and Assistantships Eligibility As a part of the program's intention to provide the opportunity to advance academically and develop scholarship in a reason-able period of time, students in the PhD program receive a tuition waiver and a student assistantship to allow vigorous and full-time commitment to their academic endeavors . Students in the MS program do not receive a tuition scholarship or an assistantship . Assistantships for students in the PhD program may be withheld or reduced for those students that fail to provide a full com-mitment to research and scholarly activities after passing the pre-candidacy examination . T his reduction will be submitted to the Graduate Advisory Council (GAC) via a recommendation by the student's advisor . T he GAC may then inquire into this issue and decide on an outcome . Students in good academic/research standing are assured of their assistantship for five years by their sponsoring department or section . Assistantship support beyond five years is at the discretion of the advisor . Students are accepted into the program with the understanding that they will devote their full time to learning and research . Students in the PhD degree track receiving an assistantship and tuition waiver who, for reasons other than departmental and college decisions, transfer to the MS degree track may be required, at the discre-tion of the GAC, to repay the cost of tuition and assistantship support provided to them .

Considerations will include overall academic record, evidence of previous ability to successfully pursue independent studies, recommendations of the applicant's undergraduate faculty, and the description of the applicant's scientific research interests . T he division director will determine whether additional supporting evidence would aid evaluation of the application and, if so, will make appropriate arrangements with the applicant to submit such evidence . Applications judged by the division director to demonstrate sat-isfactory credentials and interests compatible with the research facilities of the faculty will then be evaluated by all faculty mem- bers with expertise in the area(s) of interest of the applicant . 259 Considerations in this phase will include not only academic ability but also the resources available to support research in the indicated area . An interview may be requested . Selection of applicants will be by invitation of a faculty member in the division willing and able to serve as the student's principal advisor and research sponsor after endorsement of the selection by the division director, the Graduate College Council, and the Dean . In special circumstances, exceptions to this procedure may be made for students with unusual promise but with no firm commitment to a particular area of research . In such cases, the program director will serve as interim principal advisor . Finally, in the case that the division director would be the principal advisor of a student, the physiology department chairperson shall assume the duties of division director with respect to that student . Molecular Biophysics & Physiology: Curriculum Usually prior to starting the program, students will have selected a faculty member as principal advisor . All students admitted to the division will be required to enroll in the medical physiol- ogy course as soon as possible after admission and before the dissertation proposal and obtain an average grade of \"B\" or better over all semesters . T he student will\u2014in the first two years\u2014enroll in courses appropriate to the student's research interests as agreed upon in consultation with the principal advi- sor and the director of the graduate program . It is anticipated that courses deemed essential to the student's graduate training by the division occasionally will not be available in the Division of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology or other divisions of the Graduate College . In this case, arrangements will be made for the student to enroll in such courses at other institutions, and performance in these courses will be required to be at the same level as for courses at Rush . In certain circumstances, a program of supervised independent study may be recommended as an alternative to particular coursework . Individual course require - ments may be exempted on the basis of a past academic record or by the successful completion of a special examination cover - ing the content of the required course . Such exemptions will not be made automatically solely on the basis of a past academic history but will be judged on an individual basis by the division director and advisory committee . Unless waived, students will enroll in eight credit hours of coursework outside the Division of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology . Course Offerings The following courses will be available, subject to demand and limitation, to students within the Graduate College: PHY-451 Physiology I PHY-452 Physiology II PHY-501 Medical Physiology IPHY-502 Medical Physiology IIPHY-503 Physiology of Striated Muscle PHY-505 Introductory Membrane BiophysicsPHY-511 Graduate Physiology IPHY-512 Graduate Physiology IIPHY-521 Mathematical Methods for Physiologists PHY-524 Linear Differential Equations and Transform MethodsPHY-533 Programming Numerical MethodsPHY-590 Special Topics in Physiology PHY-598 Introduction to Physiology Research PHY-640 Applied Electrophysiology PHY-651 Advanced Topics in Muscle Physiology PHY-690 Research Topics in Physiology PHY-699 Dissertation Research in PhysiologyMolecular Biophysics & Physiology: Dissertation Process Dissertation Proposal Upon admission to the division, the student and his or her principal advisor will begin to make preparations for a proposal upon which the student's original research project will be based . Such preparations will include intensive study of the literature in the student's field of interest, instruction in the basic labora-tory skills necessary for professional development in the field, and any other requirements established by the principal advisor and division director in addition to the course requirements discussed above . No later than 36 months after admission, the candidate will present to his or her dissertation committee an original proposal for contribution to knowledge in his or her area of specialization . It will include an extensive review of the relevant scientific literature, a description of the technical aspects of the proposed studies, an outline of the anticipated experimental approach to the major problem of interest and a discussion of possible results and their interpretation . T he student will be expected to defend both his or her proposal and general ability to achieve professional competence before this committee . T he dissertation committee will have at least three members: the principal advisor; the division director; and, 260 whenever possible, an individual outside the institution with national stature in the candidate's field of interest, selected jointly by the candidate, principal advisor and division director . In addition to evaluating the content of the dissertation proposal, the outside member will have a responsibility to maintain close and frequent contact with the student and principal advisor and to advise the division director concerning the progress of the academic program . Ordinarily, the dissertation committee will be constituted as soon as possible after admission of a student to the division . The dissertation proposal may be submitted to the faculty prior to completion of course requirements in order to enable research activity to begin, but the student will not be for - mally admitted to candidacy until this is satisfactorily completed . Candidacy Upon acceptance of the dissertation proposal, the student will be admitted to doctoral candidacy and will be expected to devote fully his or her energies to the program . All students must meet a minimum residency requirement of one calendar year, following admission to candidacy, unless the division direc- tor and Dean grant special exceptions . T he principal advisor will make frequent reports to the division director concerning the student's progress . Should either a faculty member or the candi - date feel it appropriate, the dissertation committee can be called into session to judge the student's continued participation in the graduate program or to determine possible alterations in the area of his or her research efforts . In addition, the student and principal advisor will be expected to consult periodically with the other committee members, who may also request the division director to call formal meetings of the dissertation committee . Conflicts between the student and/or any members of the dis-sertation committee not resolvable by the full committee may be referred to the advisory committee of the division or higher authority as specified in the policies and procedures of the Graduate College . T he degree of Doctor of Philosophy is given in recognition of high attainment and ability in a particular field of scientific research as evidenced by submission of a disserta-tion showing power of independent investigation and forming an actual contribution to existing knowledge . Such dissertation will be submitted to the candidate's dissertation committee for review and defended orally at least three months before the degree is granted . T he dissertation committee will ordinar - ily request an evaluation of the candidate's dissertation by a scientist of national stature not affiliated with Rush University . Acceptance of the dissertation by the dissertation committee will be reviewed by the Graduate College Council and the Dean, along with the candidate's entire academic performance in the Graduate College . Determination of completion of all require - ments will result in the Dean's recommendation that the degree be awarded . Should the candidate not have submitted a dis - sertation three years after admission to candidacy, the disserta-tion committee will be convened to evaluate the candidate's progress and, if proper, to suggest alteration in the program . Molecular Biophysics & Physiology: Research Activities Theoretical Descriptions of Membrane Ion Channels: Robert S. Eisenberg works on the mechanisms of selectivity and permeation in ion channels . Ion channels are proteins with a hole down their middle that control a large fraction of the functions of life . Once open, spherical ions lik e sodium, potas - sium, calcium and move through them by electro-diffu- sion . Dr . Eisenberg applies modern theories of ionic solutions to simple models of ion channels, using a variety of mathematical methods, from classical Metropolis Monte Carlo to modern methods of variational calculus, the energetic variational meth- ods used in the theory of complex fluids . T hese simple models have been able to reproduce the selectivity properties of the calcium channels of the heart and of the sodium channels of nerve with the same set of parameters, using the (unchanging) crystal radii of ions . Current voltage relations are just now being calculated and there are signs that at least some of the proper - ties of transporters and of (spontaneous) gating may emerge from models of this sort, without explicit structural changes . Dirk Gillespie uses theories of liquids (like density functional theory, or DFT) to model ion movement . All projects have a very close relationship with experimental groups that provide data and test the models' predictions . Of particular interest are: Ryanodine receptor (RyR) and L-type calcium channels in muscle, which are involved in initiating muscle contraction, to understand how ions move through these pores (permeation) and why some kinds of ions are preferentially conducted (selectivity) . The physiological consequences of these mecha - nisms (and their disruption in disease states) are also studied . Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in which the Ca2+ released by one RyR opens neighboring RyRs, which in turn open other RyRs . The goal is to understand the mechanism of CICR, the mechanism for stopping CICR, and changes in CICR dur - ing disease states . Understanding and developing new nonbiological nanofluidic devices, devices that move electrolytes through nanometer- sized pores in manmade materials to create current . T he goal is to understand their physics and to predict new unique device properties for future applications .261 This lab is best suited for those with a background in physics and math who are interested in using, developing or imple-menting new modeling techniques, within an environment of collaboration with both theorists and experimentalists . Gillespie, D . 2008 . a Fill . 2008 . Intracellular calcium release channels mediate their own countercurrent: The case study 2009 . T uning with local charge inversion oxidase. The main interest of Tom DeCoursey's laboratory over the past decade has been in two molecules that reside in the membranes of white blood cells . These are proton channels and NADPH oxidase . Both play vital roles in white blood cells when these cells kill bacteria and other microbial invaders . When NADPH o xidase does not work, white cells cannot kill many types of bacteria . Patients afflicted with hereditary chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) lack this enzyme, and if not treated often die in childhood of recurrent infections . Dr . DeCoursey's labor atory has shown that inhibiting proton channels prevents NADPH oxidase from working (DeCoursey et al ., 2003, Nature 422:531-534) and that this results from the effects of proton channels on membrane potential and pH (Morgan et al 2009, that in human basophils, inhibiting proton channels prevents histamine proton channels control sperm maturation . The DeCoursey laboratory continues to investigate roles played by proton channels in a variety of cells, such as B lymphocytes (Capasso et al ., 2010, Nature Immunol . 11:265-272) . T hey recently discovered a new proton channel gene in a dinoflagel-late, which triggers the bioluminescent flash produced by these creatures when seawater is disturbed at night (Smith et al ., 2011, Another focus of their current research is understanding how the proton channel works on a molecular scale . Because the proton channel gene was identified only in 2006, much work remains to be done . T hey design mutations to the protein, express the mutant channels in cultured cells and then record electrically from the cells to determine how the mutation affected the function of the molecule . For example , they found that the regulation of channel activity by phosphorylation occurs at a specific threonine residue in the intracellular part of the channel (Musset et al . Biol . Chem . 285:5117-5121) . figure shows they believe the proton channel dimer is assembled (Musset . Physiol . Very recently, laboratory identified the \"selectivity filter\" of the human proton channel (the part that allows only H+ and no other ions to go through the channel) (Musset et al ., 2011, Nature, 480:273-277) . Viral Fusion. Viruses deposit their genetic material into cells by fusing to membranes, initiating infection . Some viruses fuse directly to plasma membranes and others are internalized into endosomes where low pH triggers fusion . In both cases, the nucleocapsid leaves the viral interior by moving through the fusion pore into cytosol . Without fusion, the virion cannot infect the cell . There are three classes of viral fusion proteins . All types of viruses that utilize class II or class III proteins initiate infection by fusing from within endosomes . Fredric Cohen's labora- tory has found that fusion induced by class II and class III viral proteins (but not class I) is dependent on the voltage across the target membrane . If the voltage across an endosomal membrane was pharmacologically controlled, infection may be prevented . Furthermore, the similarity in structure of all class II proteins and the similarity between all class III proteins suggests that identify-ing a voltage sensor for one virus of a class should readily yield the sensor for many . T he Cohen laboratory has also found that viral fusion mediated by class II or class III proteins varies with redox potentials, but fusion mediated by class I proteins do not . The range of values of redox potentials within interiors of endosomes differs for different types of endosomes . V ariation of redox potentials can provide an important control for conforma- tional changes of viral fusion proteins within endosomes . T his has both conceptual and practical ramifications . Not all viruses within endosomes fuse and even a particular type of virus can enter cells through multiple endosomal pathways . T he variation in redox potentials for endosomes of different pathways would account, at least in part, for variations in fusion and infectivity of virus within endosomes . T his laboratory is pursuing the mecha - nisms by which membrane potentials and redox potentials regulate fusion and are characterizing how these two cellular controls of membrane fusion interact to guide fusion . Membrane Cholesterol. Since so much of cellular biology in both health and disease is sensitive to cholesterol levels, experimentalists often measure cholesterol concentration under a wide variety of conditions . But from a physical point of view, the free energy of a system is the fundamental parameter that quantifies the tendency of a molecule to transfer from one state (or phase) to another . If each molecule is independent of all oth - ers, exhibiting zero interactions, the free energy is a function of 262 the molecules' concentrations . But for real materials, interactions between molecules alter the tendency to exchange between states . The free energy of transfer is then a function of the molecules' \"activity,\" a thermodynamic parameter that accounts for interactions and that is an \"effective concentration .\" Determining activity allows one to infer the strength of molecu- lar interactions . Although the difference between concentr ation and activity is a basic textbook distinction, a convenient and reliable method to measure cholesterol activity had not been developed . Fredric Cohen's laboratory has now overcome this limitation, allowing us to thermodynamically characterize the dynamics of membrane cholesterol levels in living cells during physiological processes . T his laboratory is currently investigat - ing the changes in membrane cholesterol that occur during two important biological processes: cell proliferation stimulated by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and glucose uptake into cells as regulated by insulin . T heir work demonstrates that activation of a signaling cascade leads to changes in cholesterol activity and that these changes in cho-lesterol activity negatively feedbacks on the signaling cascades, providing a mechanism for cellular homeostasis . Regulation of Intracellular Calcium: Eduardo Rios studies the workings of muscles, including skeletal and cardiac . T he goal of this laboratory is to understand the cellular function of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in terms of fundamental mechanisms . EC coupling translates electrical changes at the cell membrane to signals coded as increase in cytosolic Ca2+ signals that result in muscle contrac- tion . The mouse deploys extremely rapid calcium signals in its muscles, made possible by fast opening and closing of molecular channels that allow calcium to cross the walls of its cellular stores . In a working human, this gating is also very fast . But too much calcium may have unintended consequences, as it can become a signal that literally tells cells to start dying . So, for the stability and health of muscle and other cells, that calcium signal is precarious, based on delicately tuned controls that must be as good at opening channels as they are at closing channels to terminate the signal . T he Rios laboratory has helped define the key molecular players in these functions . T hey use the mouse to study Ca2+ controls, comparing their operation and mechanisms in the healthy cell and in mice that have molecular abnormalities that copy human disease . T he information and implications derived from these studies may apply to similar alterations in the heart, which lead to an irregular beat and may cause sudden death . Calcium signals also rule brain function, gut movements and blood pressure . T his laboratory's work has contributed and should continue contributing to the understand- ing of these functions and their diseases .Thomas Shannon is interested in ionic channels, voltage gated ionic channels, fluorescence signal detection and electrophysiol-ogy, particularly as they relate to excitation-contraction coupling in striated muscle . Dr . Shannon uses multiple biochemical and biophysical approaches to study the control of the load of calcium in the storage organelle (the sarcoplasmic reticulum) of normal and abnormal cells of the heart . He has demonstrated on beating heart cells that the load in the normal sarcoplas-mic reticulum is released partially to the cytosol in the process of a heartbeat . Quantitative determination of these released fractions will allow him to understand the mutual interactions of Ca load (i .e ., sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca concentration) and Ca release, and thus the control of contractile force, an impor - tant determinant of cardiac ejection (blood flow) in health and disease . For instance, Dr . Shannon has also demonstrated that the SR Ca load is reduced during heart failure, and his research suggests that this reduction may be a critical factor in causing reduced cardiac contraction in this condition . Ongoing experi - ments are aimed at determining what causes this reduced SR Ca load . The research program led by Lothar A. Blatter focuses on the role of calcium ions for the regulation of cellular functions in the cardiovascular system . On the one hand they investigate, at the cellular and subcellular levels, through which pathways and mechanisms calcium itself is regulated in cellular compartments such as the cytosol, the nucleus, the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria . On the other hand they study how specific changes in cellular calcium concentrations control functions of cardiac myocytes and vascular endothelial cells . Of particular interests in cardiac cells are the regulation of calcium during excitation-contraction coupling, i .e ., the rhythmic elevations of calcium that lead to contraction with every heartbeat, and in excitation-transcription coupling where this laboratory investi-gates the sources and specific roles of calcium for the activa-tion of transcription factors (such as NFAT) that are involved in pathological cardiac remodeling . T hey are further interested in studying the specific changes in calcium signaling that occur in the diseased heart, i .e ., in cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and arrhythmias . In vascular endothelial cells they are interested in the interplay between calcium signaling and the genera-tion of nitric oxide, an important endothelium-derived relaxing factor through which the vascular endothelium contributes to the control of blood flow and blood pressure . In both tissue types, an important area of research centers around the role of mitochondria for cardiovascular function . T his research inves - tigates the contribution of mitochondria to the regulation of cytosolic calcium concentration through its capability of storing and releasing calcium ions, but also the role of calcium ions 263 for the regulation of mitochondrial functions, including energy metabolism and ATP production, regulation of mitochondrial channels such as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and control of the cellular redox state and protection against oxidative stress . For the study of these signaling processes and pathways this laboratory employs a wide palette of methodolog-ical approaches, ranging from high resolution confocal imaging using a large spectrum of fluorescent probes, to electrophysiol-ogy (patch clamp and lipid bilayer single channel recordings), photolysis of caged compounds, molecular biology and bio- chemical approaches, and the use of transgenic animals . Michael Fill focuses on defining the mechanisms that con- trol intracellular calcium signaling in excitable cells . T hey are particularly interested in the origin/control of local intracellular calcium signals generated by ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels . RyR channels are found in almost all cells and modulate cellular processes as diverse as contraction, secretion, synaptic transmis- sion and transcription . However, most of this laboratory's studies have focused on single RyR local control in mammalian striated muscle, where RyRs are found in abundance . T heir research has delineated fundamental biophysical mechanisms important to normal or pathological muscle function . T hey generally apply a multiscale experimental approach that is best illustrated by their published works . Some recent works are listed below . Qin et al . Ryanodine receptor .

Neurosciences Note for the Current Academic Year: Incoming PhD students should refer to the Integrated Biomedical Sciences section of this catalog. The following information is intended for incoming MS, current MS and cur - rent PhD students. Questions about the future plans should be directed to the program director. Neurosciences: Philosophy The Division of Neurosciences of the Graduate College offers interdisciplinary education in the field of neuroscience at the doctoral level to prepare students for careers in teaching and research . The program is one of the few in the country that emphasize disease-oriented basic neuroscience and is funded by an NIH Training Grant . T he diversity of interest and expertise among the faculty of the division provides students with educa-tional and research opportunities in neurophysiology, neuro-anatomy, neuroimaging, neurochemistry, and cell and molecular biology\u2014all of which are important for the understanding of the functions of the intact and diseased central nervous system . The resources at Rush and in the Department of Neurological Sciences allow students the unique opportunity to carry out independent research on the basic neurobiological substrates of various neurological disorders . Neurosciences: Admission Requirements Designed for students interested in teaching and interdisciplin-ary research careers in the neurosciences, the program also accepts students with an undergraduate or medical degree as well as other professional students wishing to pursue graduate study . Students are admitted for entry during the fall semester of a given academic year . Applicants for admission are ev alu- ated by an admissions committee chaired by the director of the division . Candidates are required to provide three letters of recommendation written by individuals who know them aca- demically . Consideration for admission includes the applicant' s overall academic record, the quality of the recommendations, his or her motivation and ability to pursue independent studies and the description of the applicant's scientific research interests . Minimal admission criteria to the program are consistent with the general requirements of the Graduate College and include competitive scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and a grade point average of at least 3 .0 on a 4 .0 scale . The program is not accepting any new students.264 Neurosciences: Curriculum The program is preceptor-based . T he study and research sched - ule outlined below should be completed within four to five years of full-time study beyond the bachelor's degree . T he program follows the minimal residence requirement established by the Graduate College . During the first two years, students are expected to complete required coursework (and any deficien- cies) . First-year required courses consist of the Graduate College core curriculum courses, the Rush Medical College Medical Neurobiology (NEU-502) course and Introduction to Physiology/ Pharmacology (PHR-504) . Graduate students are expected to receive a grade of at least \"B\" in these courses . In the fall term of the second year of study, all students are required to enroll in and pass a statistics and experimental design course (NEU-544) . During the first two years of study, students rotate through various laboratories involved in the program and learn techniques commonly in use in neuroscience laboratories . T he requirement is mastery of four techniques outside any of those used by the student in his or her research . T he major required course in the second year of study is an Advanced Neuroscience Proseminar (NEU-591) taught jointly by participating faculty . A seminar format that encourages extensive discussion and student participation is used . A course titled \"Selected Topics in Neuroscience\" (NEU-690) is available to advanced students (in their third or fourth year of residence) for credit . T he offerings in this course change from year to year depending on demand and interest, and the course is taught by different faculty members . In addition to coursework, students are encouraged to partici-pate in and carry out independent research in their first two years of residence . Required courses in the first two years of study: Year 1 Credits Fall Semester GCC-501 Molecular Biology: Genome to Proteome 2 GCC-502 Cellular Biochemistry: Proteins , 2 Transport and Signaling GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology 1 GCC-512 Readings in Cellular Biology 1 GCC-520 Introduction to Physiology/Pharmacology I 3 NEU-598 Pre-dissertation Research 1-9 Spring Semester GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-504 Functional Tissue Biology 2 GCC-506 Biomedical Ethics 1 GCC-513 Readings in Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-514 Readings in Functional T issue Biology 1 GCC-507 Medical Research Strategies 2 GCC-508 Writing Practicum 2 NEU-502 Neurobiology 6 Neuroscience 2 NEU-598 Pre-dissertation Research 1-9 Year 2 Credits Fall Semester NEU-511 Techniques in Neuroscience 2 NEU-544 Statistics and Experimental Design for Advanced Proseminar 6 Pre-dissertation Research 1-9265 Neurosciences: Academic Policies Students are required to pass a combination of written and oral comprehensive examinations toward the end of the second year and after completion of the required coursework . Students fail - ing the comprehensive examinations are given a second chance three months later . A second failure results in termination . Throughout the first two years of required coursework, students whose grade point average falls below a \"B\" (3 .0) will be placed on academic probation . If a student fails to remedy this average , he or she will be asked to withdraw from the program . A student who completes the comprehensive examinations successfully is admitted to candidacy and qualifies for the doctoral dissertation proposal defense . Students choose a preceptor to supervise their research during the first year of residence . T he preceptor and the student gather an advisory committee that is chaired by a core faculty member of the program and includes the preceptor and four other members, two from within the program, one from another division within the institution, and one neuroscientist from another institution . T he thesis proposal should be in the format of an NIH RO1 grant application and will be defended before the advisory committee . T he rest of the student's time in residence is spent on the doctoral dissertation research . Each student dissertation is evaluated by a neuroscientist from another institution who is an expert in the specific area of research . Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to the Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog . In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies . Neurosciences: Research Activities The background and expertise of the faculty cover a broad range of fields within the neurosciences such as behavioral and cogni-tive neuroscience, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, neuroanat- omy, cell and molecular biology, etc . Research among the faculty is especially strong in the following areas: transplantation and regeneration; gene therapy; the neurobiological bases of normal memory and of its dysfunction; aging; and the neurobiological bases of degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and multiple sclerosis . Thus, depending on interest, numerous interdisciplinary research areas are available to the student .

The following information is intended for incoming MS, current MS and cur - rent PhD students. Questions about the future plans should be directed to the program director. Pharmacology: Philosophy The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Master of Science (MS) pro- grams offer training in pharmacology and biomedical research . The Division of Pharmacology believes that a sound training in medical pharmacology and cell biology should be integral to a pharmacology research degree, and students are trained in both disciplines in the first year . A student then does research in a selected area of biomedical sciences . During the course of the research, emphasis is placed on developing the student's understanding and communication of research . Master's students complete all coursework and research in two years and submit a thesis . Graduates of the master' s program have the skills necessary to work in laboratories in both aca- demia and industry, and have a fundamentally sound knowledge of pharmacology . T he vast majority of MS graduates find job opportunities or successfully matriculate in advanced training programs within three months of graduation . For PhD students, the research in the first two years is aimed at developing a novel research proposal . PhD students continue research over the next three years and are required to complete a dissertation and publish novel scientific findings in peer-reviewed journals with at least one first-author manuscript sub- mitted by the student . T he ultimate outcome of the PhD research experience is the development of an independent investigator who has the necessary scientific skills and credentials to pursue a career in either an industrial or academic setting . Pharmacology: Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester in order to begin the required coursework in the core curriculum . T he deadline for submission of applications is generally March 1 . International applications can be accepted after March 1 but must take into consideration the delays associated with the necessary visa arrangements . In addition to the basic require - ments established by the Graduate College, the division has the following requirements for admission to its program: The baccalaureate degree from an accredited college should include a background in biological, physical or quantitative sciences . Coursework in biology, cellular biology, molecular biology, physics, chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry and mathematics, including calculus, is highly recommended . Upper-level biochemis - try or physiology courses are also highly recommended . The Graduate College requires academic transcripts from all baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate educational experiences . These should provide a minimal grade point average of 3 .0 overall (A = 4 .0) . The pharmacology admission committee also looks for higher grades in science courses and evidence of research experience . Competition for PhD candidates is significantly higher . The Graduate College requires all graduate students to take the GRE examinations, and scores on these tests are considered by the admission committee . All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) . Applicants from foreign countries must have their transcripts evaluated by an independent agency (i .e ., ECE and WES) . As required by the Graduate College , a clear, concise expression of the applicant's interests and goals needs to be included as an essay in the application . Identifying a particular area of interest within the field of pharmacology is very helpful in identifying potential laboratories for the students . The Graduate College requires three letters of recommendation, and it is recommended that they be from science faculty who can evaluate the character of the applicant, the applicant's academic and research performance, and the applicant's ability to think and work independently . The division director and the Admissions Committee evaluate appli- cations . All prior academic experience and the letters of recommen - dation will be evaluated for an indication of the applicant's potential for success as a graduate student and future independent investiga- tor . The statement by the applicant describing goals and motivation will be studied to determine the compatibility between the appli- cant's requirements and the capabilities of the graduate program . With rare exceptions, PhD applicants will be required to appear for an interview with faculty members before admission to the program . Students applying for the master's program will meet the same set of minimum standards as those applying for the doctoral program . Students applying for the master's program are encouraged to visit the department, although a formal interview is not required . The number of faculty available to mentor the students' research limits acceptance into both the master's and doctoral programs . Students are therefore encouraged to apply early . Students entering the master's program will not be eligible for stipends and must pay tuition . 267 Year 1 Credits Fall Semester GCC-501/511* Molecular Biology 2/1 GCC-502/512* /Physiology I 3 BTN-525 Experimental Design & Models of Disease 2 Spring Semester GCC-503/513* Functional Cell Biology 1/1 GCC-504/514* (2) Functional T issue Biology 2/1 GCC-506 Research Ethics 1 GCC-507 Biomedical Statistics 2 GCC-521 Introduction to Physiology and Pharmacology II 3 PHR-691 Seminar in Pharmacology 1 PHR-598 Research in Pharmacology 1 Summer Term PHR-598 Research in Pharmacology 9 Year 2 Fall Semester PHR-593 Introduction to Grantsmanship 1 PHR-595 Readings in Pharmacology 1 PHR-691 Seminar in Pharmacology 1 PHR-563 Advanced Concepts in Pharmacology 3 PHR-598 Research in Pharmacology Var aible Spring Semester GCC-508 Writing Practicum 2 PHR-594 Structure, Function and Pharmacology of Cell Receptors 3 PHR-595 Readings in Pharmacology 1 PHR-691 Seminar in Pharmacology 1 PHR-598 Research in Pharmacology VaraibleAcceptance into the doctoral program is limited by the avail- ability of faculty and also by the availability of stipends . All accepted doctoral students receive a competitive stipend and tuition scholarship . T he stipend and tuition scholarship is renewed each year providing the student is making satisfactory progress towards the degree . Pharmacology: Curriculum When the applicant enters the program, a research advisor is assigned, and the student begins directed research on an active project . In the first two semesters, there is minimal research as classroom studies are emphasized . During these terms, both master's and doctoral Graduate College students take the Graduate Core Curriculum (GCC) classes and required pharma- cology (PHR) courses . T he summer term is devoted to labora - tory research . Research and advanced pharmacology courses provide the core of the second-year studies . For the master' s and doctoral students, the research experience differs in the second year . The master's students are involved in a directed research project, while the doctoral students are developing a novel research project . A typical course sequence is described as follows: GCC = Graduate Core Curriculum - These classes are taken by Master's and Ph.D. students from a variety of different Graduate College Programs. These provide a basic understanding in the Biomedical Sciences and acquaint the students with the Biomedical literature. *511,512,513 and 514 are 1 hr reading courses associated with 501, 502,503 and 504 respectively. MS students need to take a total of 10 hrs in Fall and Spring of the second year in order to graduate with the appropriate number of credits. PhD students are restricted to 9 credit hrs after the first year BTN = Biotechnology course - Taken with the Biotechnology students, serves as an introduction to experimental design and models of Disease PHR = Pharmacology specific courses. 268 For doctoral students, the emphasis is on research in years three through five, and a typical registration is as listed below . While registrations appear similar in years three through five, the nature and character of the research changes and the student passes through a number of steps towards completing his or her doctoral degree . Years 3 through 5 PHR-590 Special T opics in Pharmacology OR PHR 595 Pharmacology OR other Elective* PHR-691 Pharmacology Seminar 1 PHR-699 Dissertation Research 8 * Electives may be selected from any graduate program at Rush. Approval of mentor is necessary. A total of 9 semester hours of elective credit is required. Electives may be taken as pass/no-pass or for a letter grade. Special topics courses or readings courses are offered by faculty to assist the student in developing expertise in a particular area. These courses count towards the student's elective requirements. These courses may be developed by the faculty for a particular student to address an area of knowledge needed for the student's development, or can be open for a wider audience. Registration for these courses requires permission of the instructor. The Division of Pharmacology reserves the right to revise courses, and the student may be required to take the replace- ment courses . Such a requirement would not apply to students who have already taken a course . Minimal Credit Hours Required for MS and PhD Degrees Typically, the 53 credit hours accumulated in the five semesters listed above are necessary for the completion of a Master of Science (MS) degree . However, a student with advanced training in a related field may complete the MS degree by completing one year of study (36 semester hours) . For example , this option is available to individuals with advanced degrees who wish to develop research skills . Such applicants have already covered many of topics in the GCC courses and may have taken medical pharmacology courses . T hese applicants will spend the bulk of their time on research, and take research-related courses (e .g ., Medical Research Strategies, Writing Practicum, seminars and advanced pharmacology courses, etc .) provided the faculty waive didactic requirements . The doctoral degree is generally completed within five years . Advanced students entering with a master's (MS) degree in pharmacology or a doctor of medicine (MD) degree may have classes in the first two years waived based on their prior record . The degree may then be completed in a shorter time providing the student progresses through the process outlined below . T he advanced student must be enrolled full-time at Rush University for at least two academic years, including one summer, for a total of 63 credit hours . All MS and PhD students must be enrolled at Rush in the semester they graduate . Pharmacology: Thesis/Dissertation Program Progression Master's Program Research Overview During the summer of the first year, the student selects a research project in conjunction with a faculty mentor . T he research project is designed to advance knowledge in a specific discipline and to yield a scientific publication for the student . With approval by the program director, a student may write a scholarly work in lieu of a research project, in which case a committee must still be formed to oversee the work and a public presentation of that work must be given . Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The graduate division director functions as the academic advisor to the student during the first year . T he program director deter - mines the course schedule and monitors the student's progress . In the summer, a principal advisor or mentor is selected from the faculty of the Division of Pharmacology . T he advisor then accepts the supervisory role in the development of the student as a scientific investigator . Thesis Research The advisor will work with the student to develop a research project that can be completed within the framework of the program . The student together with the advisor will form a thesis committee composed of three members: the advisor (who must be a member of the Graduate College) and two readers . The readers will assure the quality of the document . In addition, the director of the Pharmacology graduate division and the chair of the Pharmacology department are ex officio members of all thesis committees . T he director of the graduate program and the chair of Pharmacology may also serve as committee members (readers) if asked, or as an advisor if mentoring the student . Master's Thesis A written thesis, describing work accomplished, is required to be completed by all master's students by the end of the second year . The thesis committee reviews the thesis . T he thesis is presented to the University community in an open meeting at 269 the conclusion of the training period . T he thesis may or may not reflect original work . However, original work that is published in peer-reviewed journals is a goal . Upon completion of the thesis, the student will present the findings in a public forum open to the University . At least two members of the committee that includes the student's advisor must sign off on the thesis . Following the approval of the thesis committee, the program director must certify the completion of the thesis and all require- ments for the MS degree . T he director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center must then approve the formatting of thesis before its acceptance by the Library of Rush University . Completion of the Degree The Office of the Registrar must be notified of impending com-pletion of the degree by submission of an Intent to Graduate form at the beginning of the final term . As the thesis is reach - ing final form, the student should consult with the University librarian to assure that the thesis will be formatted correctly . Upon thesis approval, the student completes a final checklist to assure the necessary approvals . During this time the student will be required to have an exit interview and provide feedback concerning his or her experience at Rush University . PhD Program Research Overview During the first and second years, the student selects a research project in conjunction with a faculty mentor . T he student and mentor then select a committee of faculty to guide the student's research activities . T his committee approves the proposed research project and determines when the student has com- pleted his or her dissertation . T he research project is designed to advance knowledge in a specific discipline and to yield first- author scientific publications for the student . Research intern - ships at pharmaceutical companies may also be available to the students and are designed to enhance the research activities of the student . Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The graduate division director functions as the academic advi- sor to the student during the first year . T he director during this time determines the course schedule with the student and monitors the student's progress . Beginning in the first year, the student is expected to gain laboratory experience . T his activity is intended to lead to the definition of research interests and to the selection of a principal advisor or mentor from the faculty of the Division of Pharmacology . T he advisor then accepts the supervisory role in the development of the student as a scientific investigator .Qualifying Exams By the end of June of the second year, the student will be expected to take the qualifying exams . Written exams will last two full days and cover all aspects of the basic principles of pharmacology through essay questions provided by the faculty . Each exam question may be graded by multiple faculty members and reviewed by a faculty committee . Passing the comprehen - sive exam allows the student to move on to the research phase . Dissertation Research Committee After passing qualifying exams, the student and mentor select a research committee . T his committee advises the student and evaluates the dissertation . T he Graduate College requires that the committee include the student's mentor/advisor and at least one other member of the Division of Pharmacology . It is also mandatory that there be one outside faculty member from either another Rush department or another institution . W e require that a majority of the members of the five-member committee be faculty at Rush who are members of the Graduate College . T he chair of this committee, who cannot be the student's mentor/advisor, will be chosen at the first committee meeting and will preside at all subsequent meetings and arrange for a timely completion of the dissertation work . T he dissertation commit - tee strives for consensus in all its actions . A majority vote of the committee's membership, however, is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the dissertation . In addition to the five committee members, the director of the Pharmacology Graduate Division and/or the chair of the Pharmacology Department serve as ex officio members of the committee . Ex officio members can participate in the meetings but cannot vote . However, either the chair of Pharmacology or the division director is eligible to be selected to the five-person committee as full members of the committee and can vote in this circumstance . Dissertation Proposal and Presentation The student will propose a publication-grade research project . The research project will include a review of relevant literature, a Specific Aims section that includes clear research goals, a Significance section that includes an evaluation of the potential impact of the project, and an Innovation section that includes a discussion of how this proposal departs from the literature and offers new conceptualizations or methods . T he Approach section then details preliminary data and proposed experiments and methods . A detailed bibliography over all sections is required . The Specific Aims, Significance, Innovation and Approach sec- tions will take the form of an NIH grant application (R-21) . T he students should follow the NIH grant application guidelines 270 in completing the proposal . T he dissertation proposal must be presented at a department seminar and approved by the stu- dent's committee . It forms the basis for the student's continued research . The dissertation committee must meet at least twice before the student is considered for graduation . Upon comple - tion of all experiments agreed to by the dissertation committee, the student will present the dissertation to the University in written form (approved by the director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center) and present the work in a public one-hour lecture attended by the dissertation committee and faculty of the University . T he dissertation committee then meets in closed session to approve the dissertation . T ypically the meeting immediately follows the public lecture . In line with the rules and procedures of the Graduate College, the committee strives for a consensus, but the dissertation can be approved over the objec- tions of a single committee member . However, if two committee members disapprove the dissertation, then it is not approved . The awarding of the PhD degree requires the demonstration of a capability for independent research and a contribution to scientific knowledge . Completion of the Degree The Office of the Registrar must be notified of impending com-pletion of the degree by submission of an Intent to Graduate form at the beginning of the final term . As the dissertation is reaching final form, the student should consult with the University librarian to assure that the dissertation will be format- ted correctly . Upon dissertation approval, the student completes a final checklist to assure the necessary approvals . During this time the student will be required to have an exit interview and provide the college with feedback concerning his or her experi- ence at Rush University . Pharmacology: Academic Policies To remain in good standing, the Graduate College requires that a student maintain an overall \"B\" average . It is also expected that all grades in required pharmacology courses will be \"B\" or better . Required courses must be taken for a letter gr ade, while other courses may be taken as pass/no pass . Students are expected to attend all classes and spend the appropriate time in the lab . All outside employment is strongly discouraged as it interferes with the time and effort necessary to complete the program . Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner . This includes respecting the rights of others and being kind and courteous to students, faculty/staff and patients . Intimidation of other students and faculty/staff will not be toler - ated and is grounds for dismissal . Sexual harassment as well as harassment related to race, color, religion, sexual orienta-tion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or parental status, or disability is prohibited . T he Rush University Catalog details the policies regarding inclusion of minorities and those with disabilities as wells as the policies and procedures for reporting harassment . Students working with laboratory animals must follow Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guide-lines and will be subject to disciplinary action in the case of abuse . The Division of Pharmacology follows the University Policies on Academic Honesty and the University Statement on Student Conduct . Students are expected to abide by the Graduate College Honor Code . Student Grievance Procedure Numerous checks are in place to assure the fair treatment of students . For example, a faculty committee reviews the compre - hensive exams . Likewise , the chair of the advisory committee is intended to be a student advocate who must ensure the timely graduation of the student . In addition, a plan for resolving any grievance involving a graduate student in this division is in place . These written procedures are available in the pharmacol - ogy student/faculty handbook and the office of the director . Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to the Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog . In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies . Pharmacology: Doctoral Tuition Scholarship and Stipends All accepted doctoral students receive a stipend and a tuition scholarship . The stipend and tuition scholarship are renewed each year providing the student is making satisfactory progress towards the degree and is not on academic probation . 271 Pharmacology: MS Tuition MS students are enrolled on a full-time basis and pay tuition; there is no stipend . T he Graduate College has offered a scholar - ship to cover the summer semester tuition for MS students in previous years . However, this scholarship is dependent on avail - able funds . The acceptance letter to the successful applicant will confirm the availability of the scholarship for each student . Pharmacology: Graduation Requirements The student must complete all required courses except for those waived by the graduate committee and have completed the minimally required course hours as detailed in the curriculum section . For both the master's degree and the doctoral degree, the student's committee must approve the thesis or dissertation, respectively, and have the completed document accepted by the graduate program director and the University librarian . In addi - tion to these requirements, all PhD candidates will be required to attend at least four ethics seminars a year following completion of their first academic year in order to ensure ongoing training . Pharmacology: Faculty Research Interests Dr. Abde Abukdeir's interests include the identification of tumor-specific genetic alterations that may be exploited as targets for therapy, the early detection of breast cancer, and the identification of treatment resistance . T he goals are to perform research that is translatable to the clinic and to train the next generation of biomedical researchers through classroom instruc- tion and laboratory mentorship . Dr. Animesh Burea is working to establish an early detection tool for ovarian cancer targeting tumor associated neo-angio-genesis, Because it is difficult to study in humans, research is done using laying hens \u2014 the only widely available spontaneous model of ovarian cancer . Focus is on developing an early detec - tion method based on noninvasive contrast enhanced targeted ultrasound imaging in combination with circulatory and cellular markers of tumor associated neo-angiogenesis . Dr. Xiu-Ti Hu investigates the cellular mechanism of cocaine withdrawal, which is associated with the chronic cocaine-induced neuroadaptations in voltage-gated ion channel function and signaling in the mesocorticolimbic system (as known as the reward pathway), particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) . Recent work has expanded to include investigations into neuroAIDS .Dr. Hazel Lum investigates mechanisms of inflammatory injury of vascular endothelium, leading to increased permeability and leukocyte extravasation . projects include study of pro-inflammatory lipids such as lysophospholipids and their receptors, signaling intermediates (i .e ., Rho GTPases, PKC) junctional complexes . Dr. Celeste Napier examines changes in the adult mammalian brain that alter motivative behaviors, including those associated with drug addiction . Behavior, electrophysiological and biochem - ical approaches are used in rodent models of the human addict to ascertain neuronal substrates that are altered during this disorder . Dr . Napier is also director of the Center for Compulsive Behaviors and Addiction . Dr. Dan Predescu performs research in vascular biology with emphasis on endothelial heterogeneity cellular signaling, signaling to and from cytoskeleton, inter-endothelial commu-nications and endothelial interaction with themselves and with their surroundings . His special interest is on the development and adequate usage of molecular methods, particularly the one related to gene expression and gene activity control . Dr. Sandra Predescu uses cell and molecular biology approaches, imaging techniques and animal models to under - stand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of transendothelial exchanges between the blood plasma and the interstitial fluid in normal and pathological states . Emphasis is on the role of intersectin proteins in regulating caveolae endocytosis and transcytosis in the lung microvasculature, the signaling events that regulate endothelial cell survival, growth and proliferation, vesicular trafficking and actin cytoskeletal remodeling . Dr. John Somberg is interested in cardiovascular pharmacol-ogy with specific interest in drugs that affect the rapid potas- sium channel (IKr) . His interests also include chiral separ ation of drugs and how this affects drug action and the role of the nervous system in facilitating cardiac arrhythmias .
