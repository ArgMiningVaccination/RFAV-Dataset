Officially recognized by the President of the Italian Republic in 1989 and in full operation since 1990, FEEM has grown to becom e a leading research centre, providing timely and objective analysis on a wide range of environmental, energy and global economic issues. FEEM's mission is to improve through research the quality of decision -making in public and private spheres. This goal is achieved by creating an international and multidisciplinary network of researchers working on several innovative programmes, by providing and promoting training in specialized areas of research, by disseminating research results through a wide range of outreach activities, and by delivering directly to policy makers via participation in various institutional fora. http://www.feem.it Center for Global Trade Analysis, Purdue University The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) is a global network of researchers and policy makers conducting quantitative analysis of international policy issues within an economy -wide framework. GTAP is coordinated by the Center for Global Trade Analysis which is housed in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Purdue University. The Center for Global Trade Analysis' mission is to provide leadership in economic policy analysis through better data, fostering collaboration, and research. The centerpiece of Global Trade Analysis Project is the GTAP Data Base, a fully documented and publicly available, analytical database for the global economy which contains detailed country data, linked through bilateral trade, transportation and protection. Accompanying this database is a set of GTAP -based models used and developed by network members. The GTAP Data Base and analytical framework are used by thousands of researchers around the world. Originally, the majority of the research was related to international tra de policy issues. Today, GTAP is still the most widely used tool for trade policy, but its use has expanded into poverty, international migration, foreign investment, climate change, environment, energy, and biofuel policies. GTAP has become a common \"lang uage\" for many of those conducting analysis of global policy issues with GTAP -based results becoming increasingly influential in decision making around the world in trade, climate change, energy and the environment. http://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu Ca' Foscari University of Venice Ca' Foscari University of Venice has a national and international outstanding reputation for academic excellence in both teaching and research. Founded on 6th August 1868 as the first Italian high school devoted to commerce and economics, it has grown and developed new relevant subject areas. The Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literatures was established in 1954, while the Faculties of Letters and Chemistry were created in 1 969. In 1990, the latter finally became the present Faculty of Science. The Faculty of Economics provides innovative teaching programmes combining economics (theory, methods and models) with legal, mathematical and statistical subjects, with management and business. Since its foundation, the University has been housed in a remarkable fifteen -century palace on the Grand Canal. Nevertheless various are now the buildings hosting the university premises throughout Venice. Ca' Foscari is now a modern and well -renowned university which offers a wide range of teaching and research activities across four main subject areas: economics, languages, science and humanities. http://www.unive.it 3 Supporting Institutions Euro -Mediterranean Centre for Climate Change The Euro -Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change (CMCC ) is the Italian research centre on climate science and policy with its registered office and administration in Lecce and local units in Bologna, Venice, Capua, Sasari, Milan and Beneve nto. The society doesn't pursue profitable ends and aims to realize and manage the Centre, its promotion, and research coordination and different scientific and applied activities in the field of cli mate change study. These activities are developed exclusively for the Center's work objectives, and favour collaboration among Universities, national and international research bodies, territorial bodies and the industrial sector. It operates in these circles in the name and on behalf of its consortium partners. CMCC activities focus on the development and applications of models of climate dynamics, impacts of climate change and adaptation and mitigation policies. The CMCC produces numerical simulations of global and regional models of climate change, as well economic analysis of its impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems and on economic activities. Climate policies are also evaluated, jointly with their implications on energy investments, research and development and the diffusion of climate -friendly technologies. Land use changes, deforestation and afforestation are integrated in the analysis of global impacts of climate change and of future paths of economic development in different world regions. CM CC activities are organised in six research Divisions: Scientific Computing and Operations (SCO), Numerical Applications and Scenarios (ANS), Climate Impacts and Policies (CIP), Impact on Soil and Coast (ISC), Impacts on Agriculture, Forest, and Natural Ec osystems (IAFENT) and Education, Documentation and Dissemination (FDD). http://www.cmcc.it International Center for Climate Governance The International Center for Climate Governance (ICCG) is a joint initiative of the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM) and the Fondazione Giorgio Cini (FGC), which focuses its research activities on the design of climate policy and related governing instituti ons. Located on the Island of San Giorgio Maggiore, in front of Saint Mark's Square in Venice, the ICCG gathers researchers in economics and political sciences who explore the interdependencies between the economic, social, cultural, religious and politic al aspects of climate governance. Fully interdisciplinary and open to the interaction and cooperation between differen t worlds and cultures, the ICCG favours dialogues and negotiations to achieve equitable and effective decisions on climate policy. The I CCG promotes initiatives at the sectoral, regional, national, and international level designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and to facilitate the adaptation of economic and environmental systems, particularly in developing countries , to the changing climate patterns. The activities for the three years 2009 -2011 have been funded by the Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea through the cooperation between ICCG and the Euro -Mediterranean Centre for Climate Change. http://www.iccgov.org TEN Center - Thematic Environmental Networks The Center for Thematic Environmental Networks (TEN Center ) is a Center for education and research in the fields of environment and sustainable development. TEN Center promotes the exchange of knowledge and information on the environmental field and offers tools and supplementary approaches in order to solve environmental issues with specific reference to sustainable development. TEN Center promo tes education and advanced training programs on sustainable development and environmental management; develops research activities on the main areas of environmental protection, with specific focus on developing countries; hosts initiatives which provide a meeting platform for the competent authorities, researchers and those who are involved in environmental and sustainable development issues. http://www.univiu.org/research -training/resea rch-ten/ 4 Conference Venue, Floor Plan and Onsite Registration Ca' Foscari University of Venice, San Giobbe Campus The conference venue is the Ca' Foscari University of Venice's San Giobbe campus which houses the School of Economics and Business. In the 1 9th century, the historic buildings on campus hosted the municipal slaughterhouse. The place, where it once was planned to build a hospital designed by Le Corbusier, with the consequent demolition of the entire slaughterhouse complex, has been preserved by the project of the architects Romeo Ballardini and Vittorio Spigai. They proposed to renew the entire area and industrial buildings with a general plan for the new campus of the faculty of economics. This project entailed the complete preservation of the 19th century slaughterhouse of San Giobbe, with a sequence of building interventions to reintegrate the area with its old buildings and ancient streets, traces and layouts, all of which have important historic value. The structure of the 19th century wareh ouse was safeguarded and the new parts inside the buildings were designed to have a light metallic structure, different from the compact walls of the ancient buildings; therefore, they are distinct from the older ones and clearly legible as new modern inte rnal structures.
