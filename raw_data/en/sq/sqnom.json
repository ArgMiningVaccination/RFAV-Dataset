Inthe United States, although theaccess anduseofhighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) have significantly reduced thenumber HIV infection, the number ofpeople living withHIV/AIDS asdeaths have declined (Center for Control andPrevention, 2001a). While many people living withHIV/AIDS areexperiencing longer lives, the unpredictable course andnature ofthedisease itself have continued toburden body functions andquality oflifeofpeople with HIV/AIDS (PLWA). Symptoms have been themajor thatPLWA encounter throughout Some symptoms aredirectly related totheopportunistic infections andother conditions ofHIV disease, while others may stem from treatme.its forHIV disease andrelated conditions (Adinolfi, 2000). Most PLWA experienced multiple symptoms with various patterns andlevels of severity. Forthatreason, efforts toreduce these illness with ahighdeath ratetoachronic illness with recurrent exacerbation of disease condition. Like other chronic diseases, thenature ofHIV/AIDS disease progression hasimpacts onthephysiological andpsychological aspects HIV/AIDS encounter psychological, physiological, andcognitive symptoms, such aspain, diarrhea, fever, anddepression. accompanying brought another set ofsymptoms thatpatients mayexperience duetotheagents' adverse effects (Andrews, 1998). These HIV/AIDS-related symptoms significantly impact apatient's daily lifeand sense ofwell-being. Managing multiple symptoms andmaintaining optimal themajor canengage inself-care actively andappropriately mayinfluence functional status, treatment completion, andquality oflife(Dean, 1981).

Alistofcommon HIV/AIDS-related symptoms cancomprise ofupto90different symptoms inthephysical health, communication, relationships, perceptions, mobility, andemotions categories (McMahon &Coyne, 1989). Besides thesymptoms from thedisease itself, complications from symptoms likenausea, gastrointestinal distress, kidney stones, andinsomnia; these symptoms significantly affect patients' lives (Erlen &Mellors, 1999). Several studies were conducted tosurvey theHIV/AIDS symptom prevalence in different health caresettings. Mathews etal.(2000) of symptoms were greater inwomen, injection drug users, andpersons with lower education level, lower income, andMedicare enrollees who were followed upatteaching hospitals. Inanother study conducted inanambulatory setting (Vogl etal.,1999), both physical andpsychological symptom distress were assessed with theuseoftheMemorial Symptom Assessment Scale Form andpain(76%). Themean Unlike the previous study (Mathews etal.,2000), inwhich physical symptoms were reported asthe most prevalent symptoms, therespondents inthisstudy reported aprevalence of psychological distress symptoms. Thedifference tobethemajor problem reported inAIDS patients (n=90) withpneumocystis carinii pneumonia during their hospital stays (Holzemer, Henry, Reilly, &Portillo, 1995). Most patients reported symptoms such ofbreath, (56.6%) deficit (34.4%) report diarrhea. Inanother Participants from hospitals, home careagencies, andskilled nursing facilities reported an average of16signs andsymptoms. Tensymptoms were reported bymore than 50% ofbreath shortness fatigue, concern over weight loss,* andheadaches.

Demographic and socioeconomic factors have been examined toreveal which patients have characteristics thataremore likely toenable them toperform self-care. Forexample, adult cancer patients with lower functional performance status, higher anxiety, lesssocial support, and more education were likely toperform more self-care (Dodd &Dibble, 1993). Agewas found Forpatients with end-staged renal disease, ageandpersonal traits correlated with gender wasfound asanother variable indetermining whether social support, interpersonal functioning andsymptoms were related tothelikelihood thattheelderly would engage thatmenwho hadgreater ofinstrumental support HIV/AIDS HIV infection, thefears, meaning and creative strategies toface byLovejoy, Moran ingay/bisexual men with HIV disease indicated that theuseofself-care activities increased after the patients knew they were diagnosed with AIDS. Theresults alsoshowed thattheuseof recreational drugs andstimulants decreased after thediagnosis. Similar results were reported inalater study ingay/bisexual menwith HIV disease (Lovejoy, Paul, Freeman, & Christianson, 1991). Thefindings showed that35outof81self-care behaviors were increasingly used once thepatients became aware oftheir tomeisbeyond Meanwhile, thisstudy found aweak correlation between symptom distress andself-care.*** *** *** ***** 13Thefactors influencing HIV patients (n=223) toward healthy orunhealthy changes ofself-care behaviors were studied byValente, Saunders, andUman (1993). Examples ofunhealthy self-care behavior change included increased useofjunk food or illicit drugs. Thenumber ofphysical symptoms thatHIV patients experienced wasfound tobepositively associated inresponding changes toward unhealthy suggested that psychological distress brought onbysymptoms health-related (Gielen, McDonnell, Wu, O'Campo, &Faden, 2001). Inthisstudy, women were asked whether theypracticed five health promoting self-care behaviors (diet, sleep, exercise, stress reduction, andtaking vitamins). Theresults showed thatwomen whopracticed more health-promoting better quality This finding suggests thesignificance ofself-care practice inaffecting HIV patients' overall health. Symptoms andSelf-Care Strategies Many symptom management studies have been conducted inspecific populations, likeoncology patients. There is,however, limited literature onexploring thesymptom self-care strategies ofpeople with HIV disease inparticular. Overall self-care strategies have been reported inseveral categories inthose studies with participants having different stages ofHIV/AIDS disease. Allan (1990) andBarroso (1995) used self-care reduction, life-style changes, and attitudinal adjustments, andthechange indietary pattern, diet ormore grains, wasthemost frequently mentioned self-care activity. Participants also described adopting more positive attitudes toward lifeasaway toregain control oftheir lives. Since thestudy andpromoting health, and \u00bafewsymptom-related self-care activities were reported. InBarroso's ethnographic study, interviews were conducted with long-term AIDS survivors (1995). Fourteen men andsix** *** * women who hadAIDS foratleast three years were interviewed. Self-care activity asafocused setofactions thatpatients usetotake andto enhance their mental andphysical health. Reported self-care activities included discontinuing negative habits, undertaking health-promoting activities (e.g., changing eating habits), being responsible forone's health, anddecreasing stress.as \" Questionnaires were used torecord theself-care strategies ingay/bisexual men with HIV disease (Lovejoy etal.,1988; Lovejoy etal.,1991). TheAIDS Beliefs and Behaviors thatwith orwithout AIDS, most They were infivecategories asnutrition, hygiene, stress reduction, nontraditional medicine, andsurveillance. Inthelater study, which used an81-item HIV Self-Care Inventory (Lovejoy etal.,1991), similar categories ofself-care strategies were described. They were summarized asstress reduction, cognitive strategies, interpersonal relationships, nutrition intake, symptom surveillance, alternative therapies, andhygiene. Although these self-care strategies were notfocused on managing specific symptoms, thecategories reported inthese questionnaires arehelpful to\u00ba describe what types ofstrategies thatpatients would use. Some studies used HIV positive women astheprimary participants. Using the focus group method, (Sowell etal.,1997) described theself-care activities ofHIV positive \u00ba dietary andnutrition practices, choosing notto usemedically prescribed therapies, spiritual reliance andrituals, staying active, cognitive strategies, self-education andadopting healthy lifestyles. Anastasio andcolleagues (1995)s\u00ba medications, were reported asmost self-care Asindicated many commonly reported gastrointestinal symptoms in HIV/AIDS patients. Inonecase-control design study, quality oflifeandself-care strategies were compared among hospitalized AIDS patients with (n=20)andwithout (n =20)chronic diarrhea (Henry, Holzemer, Weaver, &Stotts, 1999). Most ofthepatients with diarrhea reported self-care self-reported pain management strategies inasample of83hospitalized AIDS patients. Patients were asked toreport both their were related reports. Eighty percent ofthepatients reported using painmedication asaneffective strategy. On theother hand, fewactivities were reported under thecategory ofself-initiated strategies. Fourteen percent oftherespondents reported restandrelaxation activities, while thirteen percent reported physical activity andexercise. Although most oftherespondents (Holzemer &Bakken, 2000). Self carestrategies specific tocommon symptoms were then analyzed based onthese web based responses along with those ofsubjects recruited with andpencil method -*information were summarized according toeach specific symptom bycontent analyses. *** *** ** reported symptom inthissample, peripheral neuropathy (11.6%) (Nicholas etal.,2000), body therapy self-care forperipheral for symptom management. Respondents reported thathealth careproviders were their most often used source ofinformation fortreating diarrhea andperipheral neuropathy, butthat their ownexperiences formed their most often used information sources onself-care of fatigue, depression, andanxiety/fear. Self-Care Information Resources Mobilizing theresources available around oneself topromote health ortreat 1983; insearching ofhealth behavior andasacoping strategy forresponding to illness (Lenz, requires patients topossess appropriate knowledge andskills. Intheearly self-care literature, reports showed thatmost patients hadtreated their symptoms andconsulted layresources before contacting the doctors (Dean, 1981). Inaddition tothehealth information provided byhealth care providers, many patients obtained information from their friends, families, andmedia about their disease, treatment, andhow totake care ofthemselves (Williamson &Danaher, 1978). Within thehealth ofmedical Catalan (1994) found thattheactual preference ofHIV-infected related information washigher than health careproviders hadassumed orperceived of* \u00bar \u00ba\u00ba - ** * ----> ** ** ** ** 19information they receive from theformal health carestructure (from their primary health careproviders) givepatients theimpetus toseek other sources ofhealth resources wassuggested tobeoneoftheself careactions thatHIV/AIDS patients usetocope with conditions (Allan, 1990). Theinformation andresources thatHIV/AIDS patients usetomanage their self care were illustrated insome studies. Seeking information about AIDS wasdescribed as oneoftheself-care cognitive strategies inHIV/AIDS patients (Lovejoy etal.,1991). Like other patients with chronic illnesses, patients withHIV/AIDS usemultiple sources for obtaining information. Lovejoy etal.(1988; 1992) discussed theneeds andsources of information forgay/bisexual with HIV disease. Over halfoftheparticipants inthese studies expressed theneed tohave more information about building thehealth andthe immune system, handling thesideeffects ofAIDS/ARC-related medicines, fighting off symptoms (e.g. depression), andreducing stress. Their preferred channels forthat information were nurses/doctors, community pamphlets, andother unidentified resources. Theresults alsosuggested thattheHIV seropositive menwithout AIDS showed more interest management, medication sideeffects, andcounseling/financial asfriends, physicians, andthemedia (including professional journals) were themost frequently used. Other resources included religious centers, alternative healing, andsocial security personnel.

Summary These studies suggested thatHIV disease itself isanimportant factor inchanging patients' engagement inself-care behavior. Thesymptoms thatpatients experience also affect their coping andself-care adjustment tocope been proposed in theliterature ofother chronic diseases, such aspersonal characteristics, socioeconomic factors, orsocial notextensively investigated inHIV/AIDS patients. Since self-care isbecoming animportant skillofchronic illness patients, these factors should be considered when examining their potential relationships with HIV/AIDS patients' self Cae. Although several studies described avariety ofself-care strategies thatpeople living with HIV/AIDS usetomanage their illness, research hassystematically documented theself-care strategies formanaging symptoms. Most ofthestudies were forHIV/AIDS symptoms is needed. The literature review also shows that there isalack ofdiscussion about thefactors affecting theperformance strategy popular inacertain from theformal health carestructure, patients construct own health carenetwork (family, partner, orpeers) forillness management, fewstudies have documented what information resources relate tocertain kinds ofself-care strategy. This review highlights theneed for continued research inthese areas. This review reveals thatstudies onHIV/AIDS self-care have of methods oftheir The self-care strategies thatpatients used formanaging illness andsymptoms have impacts on their symptom status andquality oflife. However, fewstudies have examined factors contributing tothevariation ofself-care strategies. This study isthusdesigned toexamine theassociation among personal characteristics andself-care western civilization, andthatfrom thewestern point ofview, theuseoffolkmedicine, home remedies oralternative (indigenous) medicine areconsidered early manifestations of self-care. During thenineteenth century, several movements focused attention onself care. These movements were represented byanumber ofpublications ofmanuals that taught people how 1985). Asforcontemporary Western public interest inself-care, Levin (1983) several factors thathave contributed tothisphenomenon: (1)Epidemiological factors. Theshift indisease provided aproductive, self-protective means ofusing health professional resources. Medical technology designed forlayuse,such asblood pressure monitors andhome computers, alsoprovided anew setofresources for development. (6)Impact ofbroad social movements. Societal changes through theconsumer rights movement, civil rights movement, andwomen's health movement aswell asbroad economic changes have (1976) suggested, both self-care andprofessional care practice module. Health careprofessionals must acknowledge inmaking health decisions andtheir ability toperform successfully take over thatindividuals themselves manage most ofthesymptoms andhealth problems without seeing health care 25professionals. People conduct self-treatment orself-medication, based ontheir experience ofillness, when thatpeople seek helpthrough of potential consultants, from close family members toselected authoritative lay persons, touse when encouraging patients totakecontrol oftheir own health. Factors such as inadequacy ofprofessional care have prompted professionals toemphasize theimportance ofself-care inpatient education (Dean, 1981). Avariety ofeducational programs have been used tostrengthen patient self-care skills andabilities fordifferent clinical situations such astending wounds after hospital discharge, taking medications, or injecting insulin. Although theideaofpatient education andself-care arenotthesame in terms oftheir underlying philosophies (Levin, 1978), theinclusion ofself-care asagoal of patient education encourages more active patient participation. Theimpacts ofself-care practices have been linked with health services utilization andreduction ofmedical expenditures aswell. Fleming, Giachello, six perspectives based onacademic disciplines: medicine, nursing, psychology, health education, sociology, andpublic health. Although thefociandgoals ofself-care vary from onediscipline stressful wasonce asself-initiated without professional assistance across health promotion torehabilitation. Levin etal.(1979; 1983) defined self care asaprocess whereby alayperson functioning effectively todevelop andmaintain their own health. Self-care activities are .. undertaken without professional assistance, although individuals areinformed bytechnical knowledge andskills derived other factors alsoinfluence health (such asphysical andsocial environment, economic conditions, heredity, orhealth services). Dean narrowed the definition ofself-care toaspects ofillness services, symptom evaluation, self-treatment, andinteraction with the professional sector (Dean, 1981). Self-care strategies aretheactivities orprocedures thatpatients conduct tomanage their health arange ofdifferent forms ofself-care strategies. Inherself-care theory, ofinternally oriented actions are:(1)resource-using actions to control internal factors, and(2)actions tocontrol oneself (thoughts, feelings, and orientation). andinternal orientations. ashealth monitoring, seeking needed health care, treatment involvement, andliving with illness. Dean (1981) delineated self-care health self-treatment, engage inthekind ofself-care behaviors oractivities thatthey think willhelpthem realize their potential. Dean etal.(1986) proposed, 29Self-care involves therange ofactivities individuals undertake toenhance health, prevent disease, evaluate symptoms andrestore health. These activities are undertaken bylaypeople ontheir ownbehalves, either separately orin participation withprofessionals. Self-care includes self determined health behaviors orfollowing health promotion practice, (2)identifying ofhealth problems, (3)seeking consultation and advice specific self-care behaviors asrecommended. Steiger ofvarious forms - aspects oftherapeutic alliance between patients andproviders. Barofsky proposed self care asameasure socialization intothehealth adaptation change. 30Insum, tousedepends upon theresearch question being asked helping patients learn self-care from According tothis model, self-care isconsidered asanaction having pattern andsequence and, when performed effectively, inspecific ways tohuman structural function toeducate and facilitate patients needs Theself-care model encompassing several concepts and three major theories: self-care deficit theory, theory thatpurposely regulate human structural integrity, functioning, andhuman development. Thetheory of nursing systems suggests thatthenursing system istheproduct ofnursing practice through which These conditioning factors include age,gender, developmental state, health state, sociocultural orientation, health care system factors, family system factors, patterns ofliving, environmental factors, types ofself-care requisites constitute the therapeutic self-care demand: universal, developmental, andhealth-deviation. Universal self-care requisites areactivities, such self-care acquired conditions (e.g., pregnancy), orconditions associated withparticular events (e.g., death ofafamily member). Health-deviation arethose needs related to(1)illness, injury, defect ordisability or(2)prescribed medical treatment. These requisites represent newordifferent action orof* long-term deviation self-care being wrong (i.e., asymptom) andseek ways totheir ownknowledge andactions orseek assistance from external sources when they cannolonger address theproblem themselves. Health deviation self-care requisites alsoconnect with theuniversal self-care requisites. Thechanges lifefunctioning cancer patients chronically illpatients, relatively fewstudies adapted Orem's model thetypes levels ofself-care activities among HIV positive women (Anastasio etal.,* * 1995). Patterns ofself-care were examined interms oftheir intheHIV population.

Validity andReliability ofCoding bycontent validity. Panels ofexperts inHIV/AIDS care and health care research were invited toreview schemes summarized bythe investigator. Thereliability ofcoding buthave notbeen ofself-care strategies and code them based onthenewly developed categories. After thecoding wasfinished, the 43results were compared andcode theself-care information resources based onthenewly developed categories ofinformation resources. Similarly, after thecoding wascompleted, differences intheproportions ofusing newly developed categories ofself-care strategies learned from each typeofinformation resource? New variables were generated according tonewly developed categories forboth self-care strategies andself-care information resources. Since could beselected ineach survey, thevariables ofself-care strategies andinformation resources were both considered asmultiple response items. Multiple dichotomy method wasused forvariable mapping, which aindividual variable resources used inself-comforting strategy (e.g., self-comforting strategy with selfasinformation source, self-comforting strategy with personal network asinformation source, self-comforting strategy with community asinformation source, andself-comforting strategy with health careprovider asinformation source). Therefore, there were 32newvariables created (four types of information resources xeight self-care strategies). Tocompare theproportions ofself-care strategies used among different information resources, multiple 2by2cross-tab tables andMcNemar tests were used to 45compare theproportion ofeach kind ofself-care strategy learned from each type of information resource. Since more than onetype ofself-care strategy could bereported strategy (e.g., medication strategy) were firstselected across resources ofself-care information todetermine theproportion ofusing thisparticular strategy (e.g., medication strategy) within each information resource.

Separate anested data analysis approach tostructure research questions and data analysis procedures. Phase oneoftheanalysis used quantitative content analysis to develop inductively ascheme symptom strategies across self-care information resources andsymptoms; each completed survey based ononesymptom was treated astheunitofanalysis. Phase three oftheanalysis tested thepredictive model of personal anddisease foreach type strategy use. Orem's self caretheory andHolzemer's Outcomes Model forHealth Care Research were used to guide theselection ofvariables. Thecategory scheme includes eight types ofself-care strategies: medications, complementary treatment, self-comforting, daily thoughts/activities, changing diet, help seeking, exercise, andspiritual care. thatareused for 85different symptoms. People surveys reported using less self-comforting, helpseeking, asself-care Generalizability Because thesample wasrecruited from many clinical sites, sample diverse ofpatients andcanapproximately represent thenature ofthe population ofpeople living forsample alsoapproximates thenational distribution intheUnited States. forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), therace/ethnicity distribution ofcumulative AIDS cases through June 2001 (n=793,026) includes notonlyparticipants from theUnited States butalsosome subjects from other countries inthestudy through theweb analysis from astudy with so there arepossible forself-care strategies and self-care information resources were created after careful categorization from content analysis andreliability testing. Itwastherefore possible toexamine theuses ofdifferent types ofself-care toaddnewdimensions inthedata setandpropose thetext/narrative data andinformation resources onself-care. Processing data directly from theparticipants' some issues mayarise during ofcontent analysis istheclassification and compression ofmany words ofthetextintomuch fewer content categories. This classification process canbebased either ontheprecise meaning ofthewords orwords bearing similar connotations. ofSelf-Care living with fortheself-care oftheir symptoms (medications, self-comforting, complementary treatments, daily thoughts/activities, changing diet, seeking help, spiritual care, andexercise). Theeight categories ofself-care strategies reported self carestrategies. This finding isconsistent with studies thathave theorized about thekinds Dean, 1981). There isalimited literature thatexplores self-care strategies among people with HIV disease. Several categories ofself-care strategies were alsoidentified inthese studies. Lovejoy etal.(1991) summarized self-care strategies asreported from HIV-positive men asstress reduction, cognitive strategies, interpersonal relationships, nutrition intake, symptom surveillance, alternative therapies andhygiene (n=162). Allan (1990) reported 88thattheself-care activities ofHIV-positive menincluded diet, exercise, stress reduction, life-style changes, andattitudinal adjustments (n=11).Sowell (1997) described activities used byHIV-positive women such asspecial dietary andnutritional practices, choosing nottousemedically prescribed therapies, spiritual reliance andrituals, staying active, cognitive strategies, self-education andadopting (n= with these interms of identifying various non-pharmaceutical strategies used inself-care. Thesignificant differences between thisstudy andtheprevious ones isthattheself-care strategies study intheliterature wasfound thatcompared self-care strategies Thefindings demonstrate thatpeople living with HIV/AIDS develop their symptom self-care strategies mostly from their ownexperiences, experiments, learning from family andfriends, andcommunity resources. Among theidentified resources ofself-care information, only 28% were from various kinds ofhealth care providers likephysicians, psychiatrists, andnutritionists. Theremaining information members selected authoritative aspotential consultants, before they reach theprofessionals. These findings arealsoconsistent with other studies (Lovejoy etal.,1992) thatdemonstrate how HIV positive patients use multiple sources Health careproviders areneither thesole used information inmost self-care strategies, with theexception ofmedication strategies, which arelearned mostly from health careproviders, andspiritual care strategies, which aremostly obtained from personal networks. Noexisting study incurrent HIV/AIDS literature hasmade similar comparisons. help resources patients usewhen seeking tothem ofthisstudy regarding characteristics ofweb-based subjects useofInternet tobeyoung, white, male, well-educated, non-users ofinjection drugs, and positively diagnosed with AIDS. Similar results were obtained inother studies thatused web-based questionnaires andsurveys: once, andthattheInternet users were significantly more likely tobe better educated andhave higher income. These findings suggest thatconducting web based surveys canbenefit health careresearch since Internet usehasnotpenetrated groups andclasses of Society equally. Consequently, many HIV/AIDS patients simply donothave access tothe Internet, and any web-based survey would notinclude their data. This study alsocompared theuseofself-care andinformation resources web-based andinterview asresource. Besides thedemographic distinction between web-based and participants, another possible explanation isthatthepersonality characteristics ofthepeople who canusetheInternet comfortably might Thepopularity mayhave already ofusing andconducting searches on theInternet requires being possible explanation isthatthesocial support differs their symptoms incomparison with thefemale ornon-White participants who were recruited mostly intheinterview surveys. Predictors ofSelf-Care Strategies This study tested anddisease characteristics totheuseofself-care strategy. Thepredictors included age,gender, race, education, injection drug use,insurance status, income status, whether thepatient istaking antiretroviral mediations, symptom intensity, symptom bothersomeness, andthedegree to which thesymptom affects daily life.Among theeight types ofself-care strategies, the predictive model explained theuseoffourself-care strategies: medications, self comforting, helpseeking, andspiritual carestrategies than men. Medications These results suggest thatincreased symptom intensity causes people toadopt strategies having more direct therapeutic effects, likemedications, toalleviate symptoms. available tovarious cultural groups. over medications, asshown intheresults ofthisstudy, may betheresult of individual coping habits andexperiences, inadequate resources from health care professionals, inadequate access tomedications, orhigher levels ofpsychosocial stress thatwould prompt care. Using medications hasbeen considered thetraditional, orthodox approach for alleviating symptoms anddiscomfort. This study shows thatsymptom intensity significantly predicts theuseofmedications forself-care. Themedications reported from thisstudy included both prescribed andover-the-counter medications. Earlier studies have already pointed outthatusing over-the-counter ornon-prescribed medications hasbeen a common, daily self-care behavior (Dean, 1981; Segall, 1990). Besides antiretroviral agents, Fogelman etal.(1994) reported thatHIV/AIDS (n =2,801) used concomitant drugs such asanti-infectives, analgesics, antipyretics, and 93vitamins. Other studies Smith, Boyd, andKirking (1999), who found thatAfrican-Americans were lesslikely to usenonprescription drugs, vitamins, andherbs, compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Similarly, Hispanics were lesslikely toreport useofherbs orrecreational drugs thannon Hispanic Whites. Spiritual care Spirituality hasbeen documented asacoping resource forpeople living with chronic illnesses such asHIV. Ithasbeen viewed asacomponent by &Kenny, Women with HIV described theimportance ofspirituality intheir dealing with the economic, physical, social andemotional ofeveryday lifewhile living with this life-threatening disease (Woodard using thefocus group method (n=45)concluded thatthethemes ofspirituality used byHIV positive women included relationship with andmeditation, peace, love, andreligiosity (Guillory, Sowell, &Seals, 1997). Athird study found that there was asignificant positive relationship between hope andspiritual activities among HIV-infected seeking Help-seeking activities were found tobeused more widely bynon-White HIV infected patients inthisstudy. Thehelp-seeking strategies include talking toorseeking helpfrom both health ofbehavior across different cultural groups. However, some early studies described theactivities among HIV/AIDS positive gaymen ofhelp-seeking from either professional ofgay/bisexual African-American men (n=316) showed that36% ofthesample reported seeking help outoftheir concerns about HIV high-risk sexual behaviors. Peers andprofessionals were themost widely sought sources ofhelp. Furthermore, those who were HIV seropositive were more likely toseek helpfrom professionals andpeers (Peterson etal.,1995). Another study demonstrated thatfriends andprimary sexual partners were themost frequently sources sought indealing with death anxiety. In addition, menexperiencing HIV symptoms were more likely thanHIV-negative and asymptomatic men tousesupport from formal sources (medical, psychological) (Catania, Turner, Choi, &Coates, 1992). Self-comforting Whereas thisstudy examines andcompares self-comforting strategies (taking naps, reading books, crying, taking showers, watching TV,keeping busy, listening tomusic, rubbing legs, counting, etc.\u2014actions intended toprovide comfort andtemporarily relieve 95symptoms) among Complementary treatment Thepredictive theuseofcomplementary treatments, daily thoughts/activities, changing diet, andexercise strategies. Other variables may contribute totheir use.HIV/AIDS patients areincreasingly using complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) factors with theself-reported useofcomplementary therapies among HIV/AIDS patients living inthesouthern United thepercentage ofcomplementary therapy usewas31%. That study alsofound thatpeople who used complementary therapy were more likely tobewhite, female, ahighschool graduate, andacquainted with another complementary therapy user. Thepresent study, however, found nopredictive relationship from personal characteristics anddisease characteristics, perhaps because oftheincreasingly useofcomplementary treatments among allgroups patients White Thus, maynotbeablesignificantly differences incomplementary self-care strategies. However, thecomparisons across symptoms from study suggests thatexercise isused most frequently fortoalleviate Incomparison, (2001) reported thatpeople with HIV made changes inhealth-promoting behaviors (diet, exercise, smoking, andsubstance use) after they tested positive forHIV. Thedesire toget involved inone's HIV care, seek information, andcope positively with thedisease were alsocorrelated with these changes. According toother studies inthisarea, of these strategies mayalsodepend more Kim, Spiegelman, Rimm, &Gorbach, 2001).

Like those who suffer from other chronic illnesses, HIV/AIDS patients adjust 97their daily andsocial schedules andchange their HIV/AIDS patients inresponding totheir symptoms.

Furthermore, thisstudy's be theones thatpatients the reporting onthese strategies mayhave alsobeen affected byalackofother, more effective strategies, which made itnecessary forpatients totryanddevelop other approaches on their own.
