Some of that increase was related to a one-time influx of Pfizer doses. Another portion of the increase was driven by an increase of 6500 doses of J&J. We understand that J&J volume may go up in early -to-mid April. Ancillary Kit Deficiency Reporting 7 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesThere are four steps to reporting to ensure enough information is gathered so problem trends in packaging and shipping can be identified. 1. Report deficiencies to McKesson directly, the customer service desk ischarged with responding to problems and identifying trends. 2. Report deficiencies to the State Department of Health or clinic/hospital leadership who may then contact the Operation Regional Contact. This helps identify trends in problem equipment. 3. If an error or injury occurs during vaccine administration, enter the information into Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html . 4.

Pop -up clinics hosted by community partners are an important resource to improve vaccine confidence and meaningful access to vaccination. for u All applicants agree to register and vaccinate only those individuals eligible under the current phase of the Governor's vaccination plan. Approval of pop-up clinics will depend upon the supply of vaccine available. The Maine Immunization Program at the Maine CDC will connect all approved applicants with a medical provider. The Point of Contact (POC) or their designee will need to work with the assigned vaccinator to finalize logistics. roHealth Equity Pop -Up Vaccination Clinic Application 12 Maine Department of Health and Human ServicesCommunity sponsors are responsible for selecting physical location for the pop-up clinics that meets Maine CDC requirements and communicating promptly with the assigned COVID -19 vaccine provider to finalize logistics, including method of registration. Community sponsors will be expected to provide staff or volunteers on site to serve as greeters, cultural brokers, and interpreters, as appropriate. The Maine CDC will review and select pop -up clinics to support in the coming weeks and identify one or more MIP -approved COVID -19 vaccination providers to serve the approved pop -up clinic(s). The Maine CDC will connect the community sponsor to the identified COVID -19 vaccine provider to schedule the pop -up clinic and allocate sufficient vaccine for approved pop -up clinic. Maine Department of Health and Human Services 13Selected COVID -19 vaccine providers will work with identified community sponsors to identify dates/times to schedule the pop -up clinic, ideally within 1-3 weeks of being selected for this role. Providers will use state -supplied COVID -19 vaccine, and ensure vaccination clinical and support staff and other staff as needed to support the pop -up clinic(s) and ensure appropriate data entry and completion of all other administrative follow -up as required in compliance with MIP policies.
