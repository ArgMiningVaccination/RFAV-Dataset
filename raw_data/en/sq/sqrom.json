Progesterone is a hormone that prepares the lining of the uterus for the fertilized egg and maintains pregnancy. The name progesterone comes from its primary role in the body: promotes gestation hormone. Progesterone is derived primarily from the corpus luteum in the ovary after ovulation. When the follicle ruptures, it transforms into the corpus luteum. Progesterone is also produced by the placenta during pregnancy and in small amounts by the adrenal cortex. If pregnancy is not achieved, progesterone signals the uterine lining to be shed and another normal menstrual cycle begins. Progesterone plays a highly significant role in the endocrine system, as it is a precursor to many other steroid hormones including testosterone, estrogens, cortisol and aldosterone. Through a direct and indirect cascading effect in the steroid tree, many symptoms of hormone imbalance can be controlled with progesterone, including PMS symptoms, lack of breast milk, amenorrhea (due to the use of the birth control pill), painful periods, insomnia, anxiety, night sweats (menopausal symptoms), skin problems and low libido. Dong Quai Intrinsic 1428 has been specifically designed to assist with the progesterone focus (luteal phase) of the female endocrine system. This exceptional blend of dong quai, pueraria mirifica milk thistle, black cohosh, ginger rhizome, blessed thistle, chaste tree fruit, cramp bark and raspberry leaf helps stimulate the production of progesterone to re-establish balance in the female endocrine system. Within these synergistic and energetic herbs, researchers have identified several coumarin derivatives that are known to act as antispasmodics and vasodilators within the human body. These key derivatives include ligustilide, butylene phthalide and butyl phthalide, ferulic acid and Research suggests that both ferulic acid and ligustilide are responsible for preventing spasms, relaxing blood vessels and reducing blood clotting in peripheral vessels. They also contain compounds that act to stimulate the central nervous system, supporting the use of these herbs as a mild energizer, tonic and relaxant both to the nerves and uterine muscles.
