[Jakub \u00e1k] EURACTIV is part of the Trust Project >>> Print Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram The EU's new Child Guarantee is designed to lift children out of poverty. But so far only 14 out of 27 countries have a plan to implement this vital support, writes Shannon Pfohman. Shannon Pfohman is Policy and Advocacy Director at Caritas Europa. It is not easy to build more schools, kindergartens, paediatric hospitals and affordable housing in just one year. Nor can we ask employers to increase overnight the salaries of single parents struggling with their bills. But we have at least three good reasons to speed up the implementation of child protection policies right now: inflation, which is out of control in some countries, the arrival in Europe of more children from Ukraine who are in need of food, education and health care, and the fact that long before the emergence of the first two reasons, one child out of four was already living in or at risk of poverty. The EU is well aware of this reality. That is why it aims to move 5 million children out of poverty by 2030, through the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee, which was adopted in 2021. According to Eurostat, there were more than 19 million children in Europe at risk of poverty in 2021; meanwhile, the number of children in need in the EU has increased as a result of the war in Ukraine. By approving the Child Guarantee, Member States have committed to guaranteeing free and effective access to early childhood education and care, school, healthcare and at least one healthy meal per school day, as well as effective access to adequate housing and healthy nutrition. Particularly children from disadvantaged backgrounds and low-income families are the focus of this new measure. But where are we now? Shockingly only 14 out of 27 Member States have so far presented their national action plans to translate the child guarantee principles into tangible social protection policies. The others missed their deadline on 14 March 2022. Only Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Luxembourg, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden have delivered, even if not all on time. Some of the non-compliant countries blamed delays on the war in Ukraine, which has led to an increase in the number of children at risk of poverty and in urgent need of the Child Guarantee. The war should be a reason to speed up the submission of the plans, rather than to delay them. We know with certainty that no country is free of child poverty, not even the richer ones. I recently participated in a high-level conference in Prague on Child Support in the Context of the Child Guarantee, hosted by the Czech presidency, and every politician or representative of child-rights agencies who attended expressed their deep concern about the lack of progress made in tackling child - and even family - poverty so far. Child poverty is intricately linked with low-income families, often households led by single mothers. This is why it was agreed at the conference that greater efforts are needed to also address the poverty parents and families face as essential for tackling child poverty. If not tackled, child poverty can lead to intergenerational poverty, exacerbated by social exclusion, violence, lack of affordable housing, and discrimination. In Germany, there's a shortage of more than 1.4 million homes for people in need and discrimination in the housing market. A child from a single parent household testified: \"We are a family of six people - my father with five children,\" he explained. \"The six of us share a hotel room in an emergency shelter. We have lived here for two years already. Whenever we find a place that suits us, the landlord doesn't want to rent to us because he doesn't want to be paid by the job centre.\" In Ireland, some parents have to choose between food and heating and buy less healthy food to pay for their increased energy costs. In Malta, families with two or more children are more affected by inflation and the impact is higher on single parent households. Charity plays its role in trying to end child poverty, but it is not enough. We cannot replace the work of the authorities, nor do it even to the same scale. All children deserve to enjoy more security and confidence, to develop to their full potential, have a better position on the labour market when they grow up, and thus be better placed to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. That is why we urge the remaining Member States to submit their action plans now and to implement the Child Guarantee without delay - and set even more ambitious targets to cut child and family poverty.
