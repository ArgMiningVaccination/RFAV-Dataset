Martin Daniel L. Winfield Anne E. Kenyon John R. Farris Mohan V. Bala Tayler H. Bingham Research Triangle Institute Center for Economics Research Research Triangle Park, NC 27709iiiPreface The Economic Assessment Office (EAO) of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) seeks to measure the economic impactsof ATP's funding of high-risk, enabling technologies and also toincrease understanding of underlying relationships betweentechnological change and economic phenomena, to further theprogram's ability to achieve its mission. To this end, the EAOcompiles data, conducts economic studies, and commissionsstudies by outside research organizations and economists. Thestudy described by this report was carried out by the Center forEconomics Research at Research Triangle Institute (RTI), undercontract to the ATP. The RTI study was intended to achieve four goals: Z to estimate potential benefits of an inclusive portfolio group of ATP projects; Z to perform seven case studies within the portfolio group using a consistent methodology; Z to develop an evaluation framework that ATP could consider for possible adoption\u2014for evaluating a widevariety of technologies with medical applications; and Z to inform the emergent ATP focused program in tissue engineering of the potential for economic benefit in thistechnology field. The four goals were largely achieved by the study. A case study approach was taken, one of a multiple of evaluation techniques used by the ATP. Case study entails detailedinvestigation of projects to evaluate technical accomplishments,commercialization progress, the role played by the ATP, andA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies iveconomic outcomes. Since ATP-funded projects are in relatively early-stage research and development, assessment of potentialeconomic outcomes depends necessarily on numerous projectionsand estimates for future conditions; understandably, this part of theanalysis entails considerable uncertainty. Results of the RTI study relating to each of the four goals, together with ATP's perspective on the results, are as follows. GOAL 1\u2014ANALYSIS OF PORTFOLIO BENEFITS RTI's study estimated many billions of dollars of social returns fromthe group of tissue engineering technologies in ATP's portfolio,large spillover benefits, and an impressive contribution to benefitsattributable to the ATP. By considering all of the tissue engineering projects underway at the time of the study, the study was able toavoid selection bias and presented the first analysis of ATP-fundedprojects at the portfolio level. While the ATP is obviously gratifiedthat RTI's findings lend further evidence that the program is on theway to meeting its mission, it recognizes the substantialuncertainties entailed in the analysis and realizes that the eventualeconomic outcome from this portfolio of projects may beconsiderably different from today's projections. A principallimitation of the study is that it does not sufficiently treat theuncertainties entailed in the estimates. RTI developed quantitative estimates for the key analytical concepts that ATP requested: social and private returns, and social return onpublic investment. The measures were given in terms of netpresent value and internal rate of return. Sensitivity analysis wasperformed for four variables in the estimation of social returns andfive variables for the estimation of private returns. With theexception of one of the projects, the projected benefits remainedlarge as input values were varied in the sensitivity analysis.Nevertheless, the results as presented do not adequately convey theuncertainties that are inherent in such analyses of prospectivereturns. None of the technologies examined are yet actually in use by doctors. The analyses are ex ante , not ex post. Companies\u2014Preface vparticularly small companies, which are prominent in this group\u2014 go out of business with great frequency. Short-run cash-flowcrunches, unforeseen technical obstacles that arise at the lastmoment, patient complications that derail clinical trials,unanticipated alternative technologies that suddenly make obsoletewhat had previously been envisioned as a great new technology,and countless other surprise developments can overturn even themost promising of ideas. If any of these unexpected developmentswere to occur for any of the seven projects, the private and socialbenefits would decrease and the economic return would be lowerthan estimated. The risk that the technology will not successfully move forward into actual use, even if it has been successful from a researchstandpoint, is likely relatively low for several of the technologies,and somewhat higher for others. In future studies, the ATP willrequire more extensive sensitivity analysis and more carefulmodeling of probabilities; the ATP will request reporting of resultsin terms of ranges or confidence intervals, rather than pointestimates, to better reflect and emphasize the uncertainty of resultsin prospective analysis of returns. GOAL 2\u2014CONSISTENT APPROACH ACROSS CASE STUDIES The goal of consistently applying the same framework to all sevencase studies for comparability was generally successful. The oneimportant difficulty with respect to consistency that wasencountered proved to be not with the model itself, but withobtaining all of the necessary data needed to apply all elements ofthe model to each of the cases. In particular, the model includedutility weights known as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) asmeasures of the value of patient pain and suffering, but thisinformation was not available for all of the specific medicalconditions relevant to each of the technologies.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies viGOAL 3\u2014A GENERAL MODEL FOR EVALUATING MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES The study provided a useful first step in developing an evaluation framework for medical technologies that had the capability ofaccounting for improvements in patient outcomes. Development ofthis early model has helped us identify issues for further discussionand has highlighted potentially productive approaches to considerin completing an evaluation framework for medical technologies. The model correctly identified three ways that ATP funding can make a difference: Z ATP funding can accelerate a project by causing it to have an earlier start or by speeding the rate of performance. Z ATP funding can increase the probability of project success. Z ATP funding can widen a project's scope. The study identified the economic burden of a disease as including the following three cost categories: Z direct medical costs (i.e., costs of medical treatment); Z indirect costs (i.e., loss in productivity and unpaid care giver time); and Z intangible costs (i.e., pain and suffering of patients with acute and chronic diseases and illnesses). As acknowledged in the study, indirect costs were omitted from both the model and the case-study applications. The outcomes of the model were expressed in terms requested by the ATP: measures for the social return on public investment, thesocial return on total investment, and the private return to theinnovating firms. The social return on public investment is based in the model on a comparison between a \"world with ATP\" and ahypothetical \"world without ATP,\" and focuses on those socialbenefits that are attributable to the ATP award. The social benefits concept includes benefits that extend beyond the private benefitscaptured by the innovating companies, what economists call\"spillover\" effects. As modeled by RTI, the spillover effects includean estimated value for patient pain and suffering avoided, to theextent that such patient benefits are not captured by the firms intheir pricing of their new medical treatments. To assign a value toPreface viithe impacts on patients, the model incorporates the concept of QALYs, where utility weights are used to account for differenthealth states associated with different chronic and acute medicalconditions. Limitations of the model or its application include the following. Not included in the modeling of spillovers is an assessment of thevalue of knowledge gained by other firms from the research carriedout by the ATP awardees, so-called \"knowledge spillovers.\" Themodel also makes no allowances for evaluating projects that areinterrelated, to avoid double counting in the case of overlappingtechnologies, or to take into account complementary effects ofsynergistic technologies. The model is presented and applied for asingle application, whereas all the technologies evaluated are infact multiple-application technologies. In addition, indirectmedical costs are not included in the model. From the standpointof empirical implementation of the model, information needed tosupport the QALY approach may not be available for all medicaltechnologies and may require additional research to derive. Acritical parameter for estimating the distribution of benefits,between private benefits captured by the innovators and spilloverbenefits to the patients, is the pricing of the medical treatments, andthis is an issue deserving of more investigation since it bears heavilyon the results. Finally, as pointed out previously, additionalattention to the estimation of probabilities is desirable. GOAL 4\u2014INFORMATION FOR ATP'S EMERGENT FOCUSED PROGRAM The study's estimated benefits for the portfolio of seven tissueengineering projects, though likely more uncertain than indicatedin the study, nevertheless suggests a very strong potential fornational benefits from new approaches to the treatment of diseasesand illnesses that offer lower treatment costs in combination withbetter patient outcomes. The opportunities for an ATP FocusedProgram in the emerging field of tissue engineering seempromising. We plan to extend our efforts to improve the evaluation of medical technology investments in two major directions. First, we expect torefine and improve both the theoretical modeling and the empiricalA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies viiiestimation of the impact of public investments. Second, with the passage of time we intend to revisit projects that have been thesubject of ex ante analysis to provide an ex post analysis of economic returns; this will enable us to compare prospective andretrospective analyses and hence to identify shortcomings in theearly analysis. In summary, it is important to note that the RTI study is an early effort at modeling and measuring economic returns for newtechnologies. This type of modeling, too, is an emerging field, andthe existing methods and tools of evaluation are as yet inadequateto the task. Yet, it is important\u2014and, in fact, required by law\u2014thatfederal agencies be accountable for and report on the inputs,outputs, and outcomes of the programs they operate for the benefitof the nation. Assessing the social impact of government costsharing of high-risk research to develop breakthrough,infrastructural, and multiapplication technologies lies at the frontierof program evaluation and offers both theoretical and practicalchallenges. RTI did a good job with a very tough task. Ourcriticisms of the study do not reflect poor performance on the partof RTI; rather, our comments are indicative of the challenges indeveloping and applying such a model. We welcome commentsand advice from the evaluation community on ways to improvemodeling and analysis of economic benefits. Rosalie T.

Technology's (NIST's) Advanced Technology Program (ATP) began in 1990 as a cost-sharing program to assist U.S. industry in pursuing high-risk,enabling technologies with potential for significant nationaleconomic benefit. ATP conducts economic analyses of these technologies to assess the short- and long-run impact of ATP-funded projects on projectparticipants and on others in the economy. As part of this effort,Research Triangle Institute (RTI), under contract to NIST, addressedthe specific challenges of developing and employing a frameworkfor estimating social and private returns on ATP-funded innovationsused in medicine. This executive summary provides an outline of the study's methodology and summarizes key findings. Chapter 1 of the reportgives a complete overview of the study, describing objectives andmethodology, the specific tissue engineering projects, and findingsand conclusions. Chapter 2 explains the methodology in greaterdetail. Chapter 3 provides case by case analysis of each of theseven ATP-funded tissue engineering projects. Our approach to modeling the social and private returns on ATP- funded projects in medical technologies is based on themethodology recommended by Mansfield (1996). We modifyMansfield's methodology for the specific case of medicalinnovations. In particular, we use nonmarket methods to value thebenefits of new medical treatments. Nonmarket valuation methodsare useful for valuing benefits of new technologies that are notA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies E-2priced in markets\u2014cleaner water or air, reductions in crime, or, as in this case, improvements in health. ATP-funded medical technologies may improve the long-run health outcomes of thousands of patients each year with acute andchronic diseases. They may also reduce the cost of health care.Valuing these effects requires extending conventional benefit-costmodels and applying methodologies commonly used in healtheconomics. The economic burden of a disease is usually divided into three components: direct medical costs, indirect costs, and intangiblecosts. Direct medical costs are costs of medical treatment. Indirectcosts are the societal costs associated with the loss in productivitydue to illness and unpaid caregiver time. Intangible costs measurethe patient's pain and suffering. Our methodology measures howATP-funded technologies change both the direct medical costs andthe intangible costs of a disease. Changes in indirect costs aregenerally not included in our estimates. The primary emphasis of the methodology developed and used in this study is to evaluate the social return on public investment for ATP projects. From a public policy perspective, this evaluationfactor is central, because it quantifies the incremental improvementin social outcomes attributable to ATP's investment. Our methodology allows ATP funding to affect the development of medical technology in three ways: ZAccelerate the technology's benefits: ATP funding can catalyze and accelerate the R&D phase, bringing benefits tothe private sector, patients, and society sooner and for agreater number of years than without ATP funding. In somecases, ATP funding may persuade a company to conductresearch in a technology that it otherwise would not pursue. ZIncrease the likelihood of success: By reducing the cost of R&D to the companies developing the technology, ATPfunding can increase the amount of R&D conducted andincrease the likelihood that a project will be technicallysuccessful. ZWiden the technology's applications: ATP funding can also widen the scope of the project, enabling the company toapply its technology to additional diseases or patientpopulations.Social return on public investment quantifies the incremental improvement in social outcomes attributable to ATP investment.Executive Summary E-3To determine the social return on public investment, we constructed two scenarios for each project: one with ATP fundingand one without ATP funding. The with-ATP scenario can differfrom the without-ATP scenario through any of the three impactchannels described above. We first calculated the social benefitsand costs for each scenario and then calculated the difference in the stream of benefits and costs between the with-ATP and thewithout-ATP scenarios. Social return on investment quantifies the extent to which the nation is better off as a result of public and private investment inthe development of these technologies. The concept of socialreturn considers the costs of public investment and the value ofmedical benefits to individuals in addition to private investmentcosts and private company profits. Private return on investment is a component of social return on investment. The concept of private return considers onlyinvestment costs and revenues of companies carrying out theresearch, commercialization, and manufacturing of the newtechnologies and does not consider either costs of publicinvestment or value of medical benefits to individuals. Social return on public investment is based on a comparison between social return with ATP and social return without ATP; thatis, between cell A and cell C in Figure E-1. Social Returns Private Returns With ATP AB Without ATP CD To demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology, we examined one specific application for each of seven multiple-applicationtissue engineering projects funded from 1990 to 1996. Assumingthat these technologies are developed and used for the specificapplications we studied, our analysis shows the following expectedbenefits:Social return on investment quantifies the net benefits to society resulting from public and private investment in ATP-funded technologies. Private return on investment considers only the investment costs and revenues to the companies participating in the technology's development. Figure E-1. Social and Private Returns With andWithout ATPA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies E-4ZThe expected social return on ATP public investment in these technologies, or the increment to social returnsattributable to ATP funding, is estimated at $34 billion innet present value. ZThe expected social rate of return on ATP public investment in these technologies is estimated at an annual rate of 116 percent. ZThe expected total social return on public and private investment in these technologies is estimated at $112 billionin net present value, or an annual rate of 115 percent. ZThe expected total private return on investment in these technologies to ATP-award companies and their partners incommercialization and production is estimated at$1.6 billion in net present value, or an annual rate of12 percent. Of the $1.6 billion in net present value ofprivate returns, $914 million is estimated to be attributableto ATP funding. These results illustrate two important points about ATP's role in funding these technologies: ZATP plays a significant role in increasing the expected social and private returns on these projects. ZThe social returns are far greater than the private returns. Private companies will therefore tend to underinvest inthese technologies. The wide disparity between social andprivate returns indicates the importance of public incentivesto the private sector to pursue these technologies. The study analyzed only the preliminary applications of these technologies. Because these technologies provide the scientificbasis for a wide range of applications, their long-term impact maybe much greater than suggested here, as companies apply theirdiscoveries to a variety of medical applications. In addition, theknowledge generated by these initial applications may lead toadvances in additional, unrelated areas by other companies. Because none of these technologies has yet reached the commercial market though several are in clinical trials the results of this analysis are based on the expectations of theinnovators and other informed individuals. Whether theseexpectations will be realized is uncertain. However, themethodology will allow us to update these results as data on theactual costs and benefits of the projects become available. This study analyzed only the preliminary applications of these technologies; their long- term impact may be much greater than suggested here.1-11 Overview The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST's) Advanced Technology Program (ATP) began in 1990 as a cost-sharing program to assist U.S. industry in pursuing high-risk,enabling technologies with significant potential for commercial andnational economic impact. ATP conducts economic analyses of these technologies to measure the short- and long-run impacts of the specific development projectsit funds on the project participants and on others in the economy.ATP's evaluation strategy includes, among other activities, thedevelopment of evaluation methodologies and case studies of ATPprojects (Ruegg, 1996) and continuous improvement of the methodsand data used to estimate the economic impact of ATP innovations. As part of ATP's methodology development effort, Research Triangle Institute (RTI), under contract to NIST, addressed thespecial challenges of developing and employing a framework forestimating social and private returns to ATP-funded innovationsused in medicine. We developed a methodology for measuring thebenefits resulting from improving patient health, reducing the costof medical care, and creating new business opportunities for theinnovators and their partners. We also demonstrated the feasibilityof this approach by applying the methodology to seven ATP-fundedtechnologies in tissue engineering. This report describes RTI's general approach to assessing the impact of ATP funding on the social benefits of these technologies.It also describes our procedures for applying the methodology toA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-2seven tissue engineering case studies and reports the results of these analyses. This chapter provides an overview of the entire study. It describes the project's objectives and scope, reviews the methodology, andexplains why this approach is valid for evaluating ATP projects withmedical applications. This chapter also summarizes our findingsfrom the seven ATP-funded projects in tissue engineering that serveas case studies for applying the methodology and offers conclusionsabout the validity of the methodology and the meaning of theresults. The other chapters of this report provide a more thoroughdiscussion of these topics. 1.1 PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE The primary objective of this project was to develop a methodology for estimating the expected social economic return on publicinvestment in ATP-funded projects with medical applications.Medical technologies present specific methodological challengesthat have not been addressed in ATP's previous methodologicaldevelopment efforts. The second objective was to illustrate this methodology by applying it to seven ATP-funded projects in tissue engineering. Tissueengineering integrates discoveries from biochemistry, cell andmolecular biology, genetics, material science, and biomedicalengineering. It produces materials that can be used either toreplace or correct poorly functioning components in humans oranimals (NIST, 1997). These seven projects, which comprise all ofthe tissue engineering projects funded from 1990 to 1996,constitute a \"virtual program\" in tissue engineering. 1 The third objective was to estimate the social return on publicinvestment in seven ATP projects chosen for the case studies.Estimating the return on public investment in these ATP-fundedprojects was difficult not only because of the methodologicalchallenges, but also because of the shortage of ex post empirical data. None of the tissue engineering technologies chosen for thisstudy have been commercialized (although some are in clinicaltrials), and many of the ATP-funded projects are still underway. 1The ATP has since announced a \"formal\" focused program competition in tissue engineering; the first proposals were awarded in October 1997.The primary objective of this project was \u2014 Overview 1-3Thus, the analysis of these projects is very preliminary and focuses only on the first applications of these multiple-applicationtechnologies. Our final objective was to provide insight regarding the factors that affect the social return on public investment in ATP-funded projectswith medical applications. By examining how the results of thecase studies differ across projects, we can draw some conclusionsabout the characteristics of ATP projects that tend to improve theirexpected social benefits. In developing and implementing a methodology for measuring the social and private returns on ATP projects in tissue engineering, welimited the scope of the analysis in several ways. First, ATP askedthat we examine seven projects in tissue engineering, with specificemphasis on four of the seven. Thus, for those four projects, themethodology and data collection were more detailed and completethan for the other three projects. Second, we examined only one application of each of the seven projects. The technologies being developed through these projectswill probably lead to a number of other applications, both by theinnovating companies and by other companies that may receiveknowledge \"spillover\" benefits through dissemination of researchresults. However, because time, resources, and data were limited,we focused on the single application for each project that ourindustry informants told us would be the most likely to becommercialized in the near term. Third, we limited the time horizon for evaluating each project. The time horizon includes an R&D phase, a commercialization phase,and a production phase. We assume that the production phasewould last only 10 years before the technology would be replacedby a newer technology. Thus, the time horizon of costs andbenefits for specific projects varies from 14 to 18 years, and thetime horizon for the costs and benefits of all the projects combinedis 20 years. Our assumption that technologies will only be produced and used for 10 years is based on the fact that medical technologies arereplaced over time with improved techniques. However, there islittle research quantifying this process; better information aboutA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-4how quickly the value of a medical innovation depreciates over time could lead in the future to a more realistic assumptionregarding the relevant time horizon. In addition, our methodology and assumptions reflect two important conditions that affect the economic analysis of all ATPprojects: ZThe limitations of available data . ATP needs a method that can provide early forecasts of economic returns and beupdated as needed. ATP needs early assessments of thepotential returns of a project before ex post data are available. We can update these early estimates once theactual benefits and costs of these technologies becomemore apparent, as recommended by Mansfield (1996). ZThe need for flexibility . ATP funds a variety of projects that affect medical costs and outcomes. To maximize theflexibility of the method, ATP needs a model that we canadapt to analyze other medical technologies. 1.2 METHODOLOGY The primary emphasis of this study is the development of a methodology for evaluating the social return on public investment in ATP projects. From a public policy perspective, this evaluation factor is central, because it quantifies the improvement in socialoutcomes attributable to ATP's investment. As shown in Figure 1-1, our methodology allows for ATP funding to fundamentally affect the development of medical technology inthree ways: ZAccelerate the technology's benefits: ATP funding can catalyze and accelerate the R&D phase, bringing benefits tothe private sector, patients, and society sooner and for agreater number of years than without ATP funding. In somecases, ATP funding may persuade a company to conductresearch in a technology that it otherwise would not pursue. ZIncrease the likelihood of success: By reducing the cost of R&D to the companies developing the technology, ATPfunding can increase the amount of R&D conducted andincrease the likelihood that a project will be technicallysuccessful. ZWiden the technology's applications: ATP funding can also widen the scope of the project, enabling the company toapply its technology to additional diseases or patientpopulations.From a public policy perspective, the social return onpublic investment isthe central factor fordetermining ATP'sinvestment.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-5Figure 1-1. Elements Determining Social Return on Public Investment and Social Return on Investment Private Investment Social Return on Investment with ATP Social Return on Public InvestmentSocial Return on Investment without ATPATP Investment Accelerate BenefitsWiden ApplicationsIncrease Likelihood of Success To determine the social return on public investment in ATP projects, we constructed two scenarios: one with ATP funding, andone without ATP funding. The with-ATP scenario can differ fromthe without-ATP scenario through any of the three ATP impactmechanisms described above. Figure 1-1 shows that to determinethe expected social return on public investment we first calculatedthe social return on investment for each scenario and thencalculated the return attributable to ATP from the difference in thestream of expected net social benefits in the with-ATP and without-ATP scenarios. The social return on investment quantifies the extent to which the nation is better off as a result of public and private investment in the development of these technologies. The social return oninvestment includes the value of medical benefits to patientsreceiving new treatments, the value of changes in the cost of healthcare to all stakeholders in the medical care system, revenues toprivate companies, and ATP and private-sector investment costs. The private return on investment is a component of social return on investment. The private return on investment considers the costsand revenues to the companies carrying out the research,Determining the social return on public investment requires comparing the social return on investment with ATP funding to the social return on investment without ATP funding.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-6commercialization, and manufacturing of the new technologies, but does not consider public investment, the full value of medicalbenefits to patients, and changes in health care cost. 1.2.1 Constructing the Timeline of R&D Costs and Benefits Investments in new technology often do not result in benefits to society or to private companies for a number of years. This isespecially true in the biotechnology industry, where regulatoryhurdles, such as multiphase clinical trials, may lengthen the R&Dprocess. A simplified stylized characterization of the time path ofinvestments and revenues includes three phases: ZR&D phase: R&D is the primary focus of the firm's activities and investment during this phase. Publicinvestment in ATP funding occurs at this time. ZCommercialization phase: Private investment in marketing and manufacturing occurs during this phase, but only if theR&D phase has been technically successful. ZProduction phase: During this phase, manufacturers produce a product that embodies the technology providingrevenues to companies and benefits to patients. Costs andbenefits in the production phase occur only if R&D hasbeen technically successful. Some activities of these three phases may overlap. For example, the company may develop a commercialization strategy early in theR&D phase and may continue to conduct commercializationactivities during the production phase. However, this simplifiedversion provides a useful framework for developing scenarios ofsocial and private returns. In the sections that follow, we describewhen costs and benefits occur relative to this timeline. 1.2.2 Measuring the Impact of ATP on Social Returns As explained above, we assume that ATP funding affects the innovation process by accelerating the development of the medicaltechnology, increasing the likelihood of technical success, andwidening the technology's applications. Without ATP funding weexpect a lower probability of technical success, a delay of thebenefits of the innovation, or a narrower scope of the technology'sapplications. The magnitude and importance of these effects varyby project.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-7Accelerating Benefits. Because ATP funding accelerates R&D, the R&D phase in the with-ATP scenario is shorter than the R&D phasein the without-ATP scenario. Commercialization, production, andthe associated benefits to private companies and patients all occursooner. Social benefits are greater for two reasons: Zthe time horizon for these technologies is fixed, so the total number of years during which benefits accrue to companiesand patients increases when the R&D phase is shorter (seesidebar); and Zdiscounting implies that benefits that occur earlier are valued more than benefits that occur later. Increasing Probability of Technical Success. The probability of technical success affects the expected value of net benefits tosociety. To arrive at the expected value of net benefits, wemultiplied all costs and benefits that occur after the R&D phase bythe probability of technical success. To assess ATP's influence on the likelihood of success, we assume a simple relationship between the price of R&D to the company, totalR&D effort by the company, and the probability of technicalsuccess. ATP funding reduces the price of R&D to the company,which leads to an increase in R&D effort applied to the project.We assume that an increase in R&D effort leads to an increase inthe probability of technical success. Therefore, the with-ATPscenario includes the possibility of an increased probability oftechnical success and consequently a higher expected value for thestream of benefits. Widening Technology Scope. ATP funding may also enable a company to research a wider range of applications of thetechnology. The with-ATP scenario may include, for example,benefits to a larger class of patients, treatments for a greater numberof diseases or injuries, or changes in a greater number of healthoutcomes. 1.2.3 Determining Medical Benefits to Patients ATP-funded medical technologies may improve the long-run health outcomes of thousands of patients per year with acute and chronicdiseases. The magnitude of these health benefits of newtechnology depends on both the magnitude of the healthR&D acceleration lengthens the window of market opportunity in our model. We assume that a newer treatment or technology will replace the ATP-funded technology 10 years after its expected commercialization date in the with-ATP scenario. Thus, if we expect a technology to reach the market in 2000, we assume that a new technology will take its place in 2010. If the without-ATP scenario includes a 2-year project delay, market introduction does not occur until 2002, but the end of the market opportunity window is still 2010. Thus, when ATP funding accelerates R&D by 2 years, the with-ATP scenario allows for 2 additional years of benefits.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-8improvement of an individual patient and the number of patients that will be treated. Valuing Per-Patient Changes in Health Outcomes Determining the value of changes in health outcomes is difficult because market prices that accurately reflect the values of thesehealth outcomes are not available. We use nonmarket methods toassess the value of medical goods and services to patients. Thesemethods use data other than market prices to determine the valuethat patients place on improvements in health outcomes. We employed a three-step methodology to determine the value of the health benefits of a new technology. As illustrated inFigure 1-2, the first step is to model the impact of the newtechnology on health outcomes. Our methodology for modelinghealth outcomes involves developing either a chronic diseasemodel or an acute illness and injury model for each affecteddisease or condition. These models use medical statistics and theresults of clinical trials to show how the number of patientsexperiencing different health states or health outcomes changeswhen doctors adopt the new treatment developed with ATPfunding. The second step is to assess how those changes in health outcomes affect the well-being of the patient (i.e., how the quality and lengthof life is affected). We use the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) to measure the utility associated with different health states. TheQALY combines morbidity and mortality into a single measure thatranges from zero (death) to one (a year in perfect health). Throughextensive surveys of patients, health researchers have establishedQALY values for a variety of different health states. The third step is to determine a dollar value for the change in the patient's well-being. We used recent empirical estimates of theeconomic value of a QALY based on willingness-to-pay (WTP)values for avoiding illness and accidents (Mauskopf and French,1991; Moore and Viscusi, 1988b). Determining the Number of Beneficiaries The social benefits of a new technology depend not only on the value of health improvements to each patient, but also on theThe medical benefits of ATP-funded medical technologies depend on both the per-patient benefits and the number of patients that will be treated.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-9Figure 1-2.

In the first few years after a new treatment becomes available, arelatively small proportion of the medical profession will use thenew technology. Hence, only a small percentage of the totalpatient population will receive the benefits from the innovation inthe early years of its use. How rapidly a technology spreadsdepends on the degree of the improvement in health it providesover existing treatments, how easy it is to use, and how costly it iscompared to the defender technology. We projected the market penetration of each technology over time by estimating a commonly accepted diffusion model, called theBass model. To estimate the Bass model, we needed to collectTo estimate the number of patients to be treated with the new technology in each year, we collected the predictions of early market penetration from experts and fit these estimates to a widely accepted market penetration model.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-10information about the early penetration of the technology and its maximum market penetration after 10 years. Because thesetechnologies have not yet been commercialized, we asked expertsin the treatment of each disease to provide their estimates of theseparameters. We asked them to predict market penetration in thefirst several years after introduction and the ultimate marketpenetration after 10 years. We used these predictions to estimate aBass diffusion model, which provided 10-year forecasts of marketpenetration. 1.2.4 Estimating Changes in Health Care Costs Our model includes estimates of changes in the cost of health care due to the use of ATP-funded technologies. We compared theexpected cost of treating patients with the new technology to thecost of using the existing technology. Where appropriate, we alsoincorporated the costs of treating the side effects and complicationsassociated with the new and defender technologies. 1.2.5 Estimating Private Return on Investment Expected private returns to the companies engaging in R&D, commericalization, and production of these technologies dependon the following factors: Zprojected costs for the R&D, commercialization, and production phases; Zprojected revenues for the production phase; and Zprobability of technical success. ATP-funded companies may specialize in the R&D phase of the innovation process, while other companies might carry outcommercialization and production. Companies that specialize inR&D earn revenues by licensing their technology to other firms thatcommercialize and produce new products. However, ourdefinition of private returns includes the costs and benefits from allthree phases regardless of whether the ATP-funded firm or anotherfirm carries out marketing and production. Thus, our definition ofprivate returns includes returns not only to the ATP-fundedcompany but also to other companies that may play a role incommercializing and producing the technology. In our framework, private return on investment includes the returns to the innovator as well as other companies that may play a role in commercializing and producing the technology.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-11Analysis of private company costs and benefits requires information about the company's R&D, commercialization costs, fixed andvariable costs of production, revenue, and the probability oftechnical success. Data on these items are difficult to obtain. Wefollowed a series of procedures, briefly described below, to developestimates and assumptions for the case studies: ZR&D investment: For the with-ATP scenario, we assume private R&D investment is equal to the total size of the ATP-funded project, minus the funds provided by ATP. For thewithout-ATP scenario, we developed a simple model of theimpact of ATP funding on company R&D spending to deriveestimates of R&D spending in the absence of ATP. ZCosts of commercialization and production: We used industrywide cost information from the biotechnology andpharmaceutical industries to estimate commercializationand production costs as a percentage of expected revenues. ZRevenues: In each year of the production phase, revenue is equal to the per-unit price, as estimated by the companies,multiplied by the quantity sold, which is estimated from thediffusion model described above. ZProbability of technical success: For the with-ATP scenario, we used the companies' own assessment of their technicalprogress. For the without-ATP scenario, we reduced theprobability of technical success as a function of theestimated decrease in total R&D effort. 1.2.6 Calculating Measures of Economic Return We calculated measures of economic return from three perspectives: the social return on public investment, the socialreturn on (public and private) investment, and the private return on(private) investment. For each of the three perspectives, we calculated two summary measures of economic return: the net present value (NPV) and theinternal rate of return (IRR). NPV is the most accurate method forevaluating the economic impact of a project. NPV is defined by NPV = t=1n NBt (1+r)t(1.1) where t indexes the year in which either benefits or cost occur, NB t is the expected net benefit (benefit minus cost) in year t, n is the number of years over which benefits or costs accrue, and r is aA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-12prespecified discount rate. An NPV greater than zero indicates that the discounted value of the benefits is greater than the discountedvalue of the costs, so the project has positive net benefits. The IRR is another commonly used measure of the economic benefits from an investment. It is the discount rate that sets the NPVto zero. Thus, to calculate the IRR, we set Eq. (1.1) to zero and solvefor r. We can interpret the IRR as the rate of return associated withthe investment project over the life of the project. To calculate the social return on public investment, the annual expected net benefit, NB t, in Eq. (1.1) is defined as the difference between the annual social expected net benefit with ATP andwithout ATP. For the social return on investment, NB t includes all social benefits and costs, including medical benefits to patients,changes in the cost of health care, benefits and costs to privatecompanies, and the cost of ATP public investment. For the privatereturn on investment, NB t includes only benefits and costs to private companies. For social return on public investment, social return on investment, and private return on investment, we also calculated compositemeasures of NPV and IRR for the seven case study projects as agroup. We calculated the composites by summing the totalexpected benefits and costs for each year for all the projects andcalculating NPV and IRR for all the projects as a group over thetime period covering the life of all projects. Many of the variables in this model are measured with considerable uncertainty. The estimates of expected return depend, in part, onthe opinions of representatives of ATP-funded companies and otherindustry experts. These estimates of social and private returnsshould be updated as new data become available. 1.3 CASE STUDIES OF SEVEN ATP PROJECTS IN TISSUE ENGINEERING ATP asked RTI to apply the methodology described above to asingle application for each of seven multiple-application tissueengineering projects funded from 1990 to 1996. These sevenprojects are described in Table 1-1.We use two summary measures of economic return:the net presentvalue (NPV), andthe internal rate ofreturn (IRR). The composite measure of return for the seven projects as a group is based on a sum of expected benefits and costs in each year across all projects.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-13Table 1-1.

At the request of the ATP staff, we spent a greater share of our effort and resources modeling and collecting data for the first fourprojects listed in Table 1-1. ATP expected that for these projectsbetter information about the potential impact of the technology andthe costs of its development would be available. For these in-depthcase studies, we spent more time searching for secondary data inA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-14the medical literature, collected a greater quantity of data for the diffusion forecasts, and used a more detailed medical benefitsmodeling strategy. We consulted a number of sources for information. The most important sources of information about each technology wererepresentatives of the companies receiving ATP funding. Weinterviewed representatives of each lead company and, in somecases, also interviewed representatives of partner companies. Wealso talked with a number of physicians and consulted a variety ofsecondary data sources, including medical literature and statisticaldatabases, to develop estimates of costs and benefits. Below, we provide brief descriptions of each of the technologies. We describe the in-depth case study projects first, in chronologicalorder according to date of funding; then we move on to the briefcase study projects, also in chronological order. 1.3.1 Human Stem Cell and Hematopoietic Expansion Systems Aastrom Biosciences' ATP project addresses improvement of bone marrow and stem cell transplant, an increasingly popular therapy inthe U.S. A particular growth area is autologous bone marrowtransplant (ABMT), in which the patient's own bone marrow orstem cells are first harvested for safe-keeping and then replacedafter high-dose cancer chemotherapy. Physicians are rapidlyincreasing the use of ABMT in treating a variety of cancers becauseit allows patients to tolerate very high doses of chemotherapy withless risk of infection and bleeding, improving the patients' healthoutcomes. Although ABMT has clear therapeutic advantages, itremains a difficult, fairly risky, and expensive procedure. The objective of this project was to develop a laboratory-scale prototype bioreactor called a Cell Production System (CPS). TheAastrom CPS will be able to culture and grow bone marrow cells,reducing the need for invasive procedures to obtain sufficient bonemarrow or stem cells for ABMT. Instead, only a small quantity ofcells must be harvested, because they can be expanded within theCPS to provide the quantity required for ABMT. This will greatlyreduce the invasiveness, inconvenience, costs, and risks of thisincreasingly popular procedure. The Aastrom CPS will greatly reduce the invasiveness, inconvenience, cost, and risks associated with ABMT.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-15The proposed procedure offers the potential of removing tumor cells and other undesirables in the bone marrow as well. Thecurrent form of the bioreactor is suitable for growing bone marrowcells; further advances may make growing blood cells themselvespossible, supplementing the blood donor system. 1.3.2 Structurally New Biopolymers Derived from Alpha-L Amino Acids Integra LifeSciences Corporation received ATP funding to develop a novel synthetic polymer technology to create a cache of newbioabsorbable polymers for use in biomedical implants. Theresulting new polymers will be designed and developed intoprototype orthopedic devices in collaboration with the Hospital forJoint Diseases. The concept of biodegradable medical implants has gained acceptance over the years as researchers and practitioners haverealized that an implanted material does not have to be inert butcan be degraded and/or metabolized in vivo once its function hasbeen accomplished. This approach can alleviate some of theproblems associated with nondegradable implants, such as long-term safety and/or implant removal. This platform technology has broad applications in orthopedics (fracture fixation, cartilage and ligament repair), wound care,cardiovascular repair, and drug delivery. However, in the nearterm, Integra is focusing on the orthopedic fracture fixation marketto demonstrate success and generate revenue. The fracture fixationapplications, in order of expected market penetration, are 1. nonweight-bearing pins and screws; 2. dental and maxillofacial fixation devices; and3. weight-bearing plates, screws, and rods. Because the first of these three orthopedic applications is closest to market, RTI focused on it. Bioabsorbable fixation devices have two primary advantages over the metal devices they will replace. Their use will minimize oreliminate the need for a second surgery to remove the implant,which eliminates the attendant costs and risks of such a surgery. Inaddition, if the device works as anticipated (i.e., eventually being Integra's polymer technology will have broad applications in orthopedics, wound care, cardiovascular repair, and drug delivery. The initial application is orthopedic fracture fixation.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-16completely replaced by bone), it should reduce the likelihood of secondary fractures resulting from the stress-shielding effect or thepresence of screw holes that serve as stress concentrators. 1.3.3 Disease Treatment Using Living Implantable Microreactors BioHybrid Technologies, Inc., is working on an ATP project to develop the capability to implant specific cells into the humanbody that produce hormones or other bioactive agents that thepatient cannot produce or is not producing in sufficient quantity.BioHybrid's approach is to encase the transplanted cells inmicrospheres to isolate them from the immune system. These\"microreactors\" have pores large enough to permit glucose;nutrients; electrolytes; oxygen; and relatively small bioactivespecies, like insulin, to pass but are small enough to block thelarger immunocytes and other relatively large molecules involvedin transplant rejection. Isolating the implanted cells from theimmune system opens up the possibility of using cells from sourcesother than the recipient, for treatment of diseases such as diabetes. This \"microreactor\" technology has the potential to be applied to a number of other therapeutic applications, including hemophilia,Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatic failure.However, the most immediate application that considered for this studyis for diabetic patients who are unable to produce insulin to control blood glucose. This technology would be used in place ofmultiple daily insulin injections. The application will involve an outpatient procedure and a local anesthetic. Encapsulated islet cells will be injected into theperitoneal cavity under ultrasound control. Because thetransplanted islet cells have a finite life, the patient will receive aninjection once or twice a year. The dose and frequency oftreatment have not yet been finalized but will be determinedduring the planned clinical trials. If successful, the transplants will allow patients to achieve close to normal glycemic control, virtually eliminating many of the risks oflong-term complications of diabetes, including retinopathy,nephropathy, and renal disease. The most immediate application of BioHybrid's microreactor technology is the treatment of insulin- dependent diabetes.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-171.3.4 Treatment of Diabetes by Proliferated Human Islets in Photocrosslinkable Alginate Capsules VivoRx, Inc., is developing a new treatment for diabetes that will consist of transplanting human islets that have been encapsulatedin immunoprotective membrane consisting of a novel material.This material protects the cells from the host's immune response.This technology has potential applications for liver disease, thyroiddisease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. However,the most immediate application that examined for this study is for the treatment of diabetes. It will eliminate the need for dailyinsulin injections and will enable patients to achieve tight glycemiccontrol, reducing the risk of the common complications ofdiabetes. The objective of VivoRx's ATP project is to make this therapy widely available by producing a source of human islet cells.VivoRx is developing the culture conditions and methods forproliferating human islets. They are simultaneously perfecting thepolymers and biomaterials that are required to achieveimmunoprotection and biocompatibility for the encapsulationtechnology. The application will involve an outpatient procedure and a local anesthetic. Proliferated, encapsulated human islet cells are injectedinto the peritoneal cavity. The procedure will be repeated once peryear or perhaps once every 2 years to replenish the cells. The doseand frequency of treatment have not yet been finalized but will bedetermined during the current Phase I/Phase II trials. If successful, the procedure will allow patients to achieve close to normal glycemic control, virtually eliminating many of the risks oflong-term complications of diabetes, including retinopathy,nephropathy, and renal disease. 1.3.5 Fabrication of Clinical Prosthesis from Biomaterials Tissue Engineering, Inc., developed materials and methods for replacing damaged or dysfunctional tissues and organs in the body.The replacement \"prostheses\" are designed to provide templatesthat mobilize the body's own cells and induce them to rebuild thelost tissue, gradually replacing the prosthesis itself. Regeneration ofbody parts requires a biomaterial with the specific structure, orVivoRx has tested the effectiveness of its diabetes treatment using islet cells from human cadaver pancreata. The success of these tests has encouraged VivoRx to take the next step in making this treatment widely available: providing proliferated human islets for transplant.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-18\"microarchitecture,\" and the proper chemical signals and components that the body's tissue cells can recognize, respond to,and remodel. The objective of Tissue Engineering's ATP project was to further the development of its new class of biomaterials that provides theneeded structure. ADMAT, or animal-derived extracellular matrix,provides an ordered, three-dimensional structure that can be usedto support tissue regeneration. The material can be spun andwoven into fibers, or formed into films, foams, and sheets usingtechniques borrowed from the fabric industry. With ATP funding,Tissue Engineering developed its basic ADMAT materialstechnology to be able to produce a variety of ADMAT forms,characterized the necessary properties of the ADMAT substrate topromote cell growth and differentiation, characterized ADMAT forimmunogenicity, and developed cell banks to support five types ofproposed cell-incorporating prostheses. ADMAT can be used to enhance collagen vascular grafts, ligaments, tendons, periodontal tissue, and similarreconstructions. ADMAT alone can be used as a matrix on which\"glandular\" cells such as insulin-producing cells, nerve cellprecursors, thyroid cells, and others can grow and function. At thetime of our survey, a likely early commercial application wasthought to be reconstruction of ligaments, tendons, and articularcartilage. A specific sub-class of those therapies is the applicationof ADMAT to repair the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which isthe application modeled for this project. Banked tissue for repairing ACLs is in short supply, and the lack of uniformity and predictability of this banked tissue leads to a highfailure rate. If the repair is accomplished by removing a portion ofthe patient's own patella tendon, the patient's patella is weakened.Thus, the new technology will improve the quality of life forpatients who suffer from ACL injuries. 1.3.6 Application of Gene Therapy to Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases Progenitor, Inc.'s, original premise for its ATP project was to exploit the versatility of primitive stem cells as the basis for treating a rangeof ailments anchored in endothelial cells, which form blood vessels ADMAT can be used for vascular grafts, ligament and tendon repair, and peridontal and similar reconstruction.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-19that make up the circulatory system. Endothelial cells are thought to be common culprits in the emergence and development ofvascular-based diseases and medical crises, among themhypertension, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), heartattacks (ischemia), and strokes. The present set of medicaltreatments for these conditions is limited. Thus, one of the original goals of the project was to develop a supply of transplantable endothelial cells from precursor stem cellsthat can be genetically engineered or otherwise modified forspecific medical purposes. Progenitor originally envisioned thatthis particular project goal would result in using these cells torepair damaged vascular tissue, with the most immediateapplication being the treatment of damage associated withcoronary angioplasty. Other potential medical application areas originally identified by Progenitor and included in the R&D were cancer treatments andbone development. In the course of its research, Progenitordiscovered a molecule that provided an opportunity to strengthenthe goals and activities related to cancer treatments. However,research continues in evaluating the utility of the molecule invascular biology, oncology, and bone development. This molecule plays an important role in the growth, differentiation, and proliferation of endothelial cells. Progenitor believes thateventually this discovery will lead to a new treatment for solidtumor cancers. However, its most immediate application is thediagnosis, location, and staging of soft tissue metastases. Theresulting improvement in diagnostic techniques will allow for moreaggressive, effective cancer therapy at an earlier stage of metastasis,improving patients' prognosis. Currently no technologies image soft tissue adequately to diagnose metastasis at a very early stage. Thus, Progenitor's product will notreplace any current technologies but will supplement the currentdiagnostic techniques. 1.3.7 Universal Donor Organs for Transplantations Alexion Pharmaceuticals' ATP project offers an approach to solving the shortage of donor organs for transplantation. Wider use oforgan transplants could offer many patients significantProgenitor's first application of its discovery will be the diagnosis, location, and staging of soft tissue cancer metastases. The resulting improvement in diagnosis of these metastases will allow more effective cancer therapy.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-20improvement in the quality and duration of their lives while improving the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Patients withprolonged waiting times are at risk for end-organ deterioration,have an increased risk of transplant failure, or may die before adonor organ becomes available (Mehta et al., 1995). The single biggest roadblock to broader, more effective use of organ transplants is a severe shortage of donor organs. As long as we arerestricted to allogeneic (human-to-human) transplants, the shortageis likely to continue. transplants\u2014transplants fromother animals\u2014are one possible solution. In most cases,xenogeneic transplants fail because of hyperacute rejection (HAR),which causes graft failures within minutes to hours. The objective of Alexion's ATP project is to develop transgeneic animals that express key human genes to eliminate the HARresponse. They plan to develop organs, called UniGraft organs,from transgeneic pigs. Although the transplant procedure for a UniGraft organ would be identical to that used to transplant a human organ, immediateavailability of needed organs would dramatically change theprocess of transplantation. Surgeries could be scheduled at thetime that is optimal for the patient, eliminating the costs ofmaintaining a recipient in the hospital while awaiting an organ. IfUniGraft transplants replaced human transplants, they would alsoeliminate the need to keep a donor alive on life support until theremoval surgery can take place. The costs to transport organs tothe patient would also decrease. Although Alexion's technology may enable the xenographic transplant of hearts, kidneys, lungs, and islets, we modeled themedical and economic benefits of transplanted xenogeneic heartsonly. This analysis illustrates the potential benefits of xenogeneictransplants for other organs. 1.4 SUMMARY OF SPECIFIC FINDINGS In this section, we summarize the results of our analysis of thesocial return on public investment, the social return on investment,and the private return on investment for the seven ATP projectsdescribed in Section 1.3. We also provide an analysis of theThe immediate availability of UniGraft organs would change the use of organ transplantation by Zeliminating long waiting times for donor organs and the associated negative medical effects, Zallowing surgeries to be scheduled optimally, Zeliminating the cost of maintaining a recipient in the hospital while awaiting a donor organ, and Zeliminating the need to keep a donor alive on life support.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-21observed variations in the estimates of project returns, assessing why some projects provide higher expected returns than others,given the methodology and assumptions used in this project. Inaddition, we discuss some of the limitations of the model and theanalysis. 1.4.1 Summary of Results Table 1-2 shows the expected social return on public investment for each of the ATP projects examined in this study and for all ofthe projects taken together (the composite). These projectsdemonstrate a wide range in net present value and internal rate ofreturn; as a group, they generate over $34 billion in social returnon public investment and an IRR of 116 percent annually over 20years. These results mean that the ATP funding invested in theseprojects provides a net benefit of over $34 billion dollars inexpected net benefits to the nation. Table 1-2.

As demonstrated by the composite return, ATP funding is responsible for inducingabout 31 percent of the total social returns from all of theseprojects over 20 years. For the individual projects, the effect ofATP on social returns ranges from about 25 percent to 100 percentof the social returns. Social returns to these projects can vary with respect to the number of patients treated, the value of the health benefits of the newtechnology, their impact on health care costs, and the probabilityof technical success. For example, our models of the applicationsfor \"Stem Cell Expansion\" and \"Biopolymers for Tissue Repair\"include health care cost savings but no health benefits. 2 The projects \"Living Implantable Microreactors\" and \"ProliferatedHuman Islets\" provide similar health benefits but differ with respectto their impact on health care costs and their probability oftechnical success. 2As explained in Chapter 3, these technologies both provide potential health benefits; however, we were not able to obtain data to quantify these benefits.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-23To demonstrate the pathways by which ATP funding induces this increase in social returns, Table 1-4 shows how ATP funding affectsthe three channels of social returns identified earlier. Recall thatATP might affect the development of medical technologies byaccelerating the technology's benefits, increasing the probability ofsuccess, or widening the technology's applications. Table 1-4shows the magnitude of these impacts for each project. Asexplained in Chapter 3, the acceleration effect contributes about81 percent of ATP's impact on social returns. Table 1-4.

For the 2-year ranges, we used the lower number for our analysis. For the 3-year range, we used the midpoint of the range. bOur model allows conceptually for ATP funding to widen the scope of a project. In practice, for the applications examined in this study, there was little or no impact in all but two cases, which we did not quantify. Clearly, ATP has the greatest impact on social returns for the second project, \"Biopolymers for Tissue Repair.\" ATP acceleratesthe benefits from this project by at least 10 years, has a significantimpact on the probability of success, and affects the scope of theproject. According to company officials, in the absence of ATPfunding, the company might not have developed this technology atall or might have developed it so slowly that the marketopportunity for this technology would have passed before it wasready for commercialization. Although the impact of ATP is lessdramatic for the remaining projects, it is clear that two of the threeA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-24possible mechanisms by which ATP affects the R&D process are important in increasing social returns. Table 1-5 shows the composite private return on investment for all of the ATP projects in tissue engineering.3 The composite NPV is about $1.5 billion, and the impact of ATP funding on private returns isequal to about $914 million. Table 1-5. Composite Private Returns: ATP Projects in Tissue Engineering for a Single Preliminary Applicationa NPV (1996$ millions) IRR (%) Project to ATP $914 13% aSee notes to Table 1-2 for an explanation of the derivation of the composite measure of return. The wide disparity between social and private returns indicates the importance of ATP incentives to the private sector to pursue thesetechnologies. Because the social returns far outweigh the returns tothe companies developing, commercializing, and producing thesetechnologies, the private sector may underinvest in these kinds ofhigh-risk projects. Hence, ATP funding serves to provide theincentives needed to stimulate the private sector's investments inthese activities. 1.4.2 Sources of Project Variations Tables 1-2 through 1-4 demonstrate a wide variation in the social return on public investment and in the social return on investment,in terms of both the NPV and the IRR. Some reasons for thisvariation include the following: ZBreadth of applications: Technologies that apply to more patients and diffuse more quickly throughout the patientpopulation have a greater expected social return oninvestment. ZSignificant health benefits: Technologies that lead to more significant improvements in the health of patients over andabove the defender technology have a greater expectedsocial return on investment. 3Although we calculated the private returns for each project, we do not disclose them to preserve the confidentiality of proprietary information.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-25ZCost-effectiveness: Technologies that offer health care improvements at relatively lower costs provide greaterexpected social return on investment. ZTechnical success: Technologies with a greater expected probability of technical success have a higher expectedsocial return on investment. The impact of ATP funding on the magnitude of social returns also varies from one project to the next. The primary factors affectingthese differences, as demonstrated above, include ZATP impact on project timing: The number of years by which ATP funding accelerates the R&D phase of theproject has an important impact on social returns.Conditions that lead to high estimates of the accelerationeffect from ATP funding include the absence of alternativecapital sources and the risk of the project, as perceived bythe company and its potential sources of capital. ZATP impact on R&D funding and the probability of technical success: The impact of ATP funding on the total R&D investment has an important effect on the social returnon public investment because it affects the project'sexpected probability of technical success. The impact ofATP funding depends on the company's motivation andability to pursue the project in the absence of ATP funds.For all but two projects, ATP stimulated increases in R&Dinvestment enough to make a significant difference in theprobability of technical success. ZATP impact on project scope: If ATP funding encourages the company to pursue additional applications and patientpopulations, the social return on the public investment willincrease. We did not explicitly model any scope effects forthe projects we examined. However, our study investigatedonly one application of each of the technologies studied.The scope effects may be evident in the number ofapplications in which the technology is eventually used. 1.4.3 Methodological Limitations The results of this study are subject to a number of methodological limitations and assumptions that may affect the results. Some of thelimitations of our analysis include Zanalyzing only a single application of each technology, Zomitting the value of some medical benefits that could not be quantified, and Zbasing assumptions about costs and benefits on the expectations of informed individuals.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-26Single-Application Analysis The study analyzed only one application for each project. Because these technologies provide basic scientific platforms for manyapplications, their long-term impact may be much greater thansuggested here, as companies apply their discoveries to a widevariety of medical applications. In addition, the knowledgegenerated by these initial applications may lead to advances inadditional, unrelated areas by other companies. Limitations of the Health Benefits Models The models we used to quantify the health benefits of these technologies have limitations that may affect the results of thestudy. In some cases, the medical benefits per patient did notconsider some effects that we could not quantify, usually becausethe required data were not available. For example, althoughIntegra LifeSciences believes that its fracture fixation devices willimprove healing, clinical data to support an assessment of thatimprovement are not available. Similarly, some of the cost savingsmay be underestimated because of our inability to quantify them.For example, we could not quantify the cost impact of changes inintermediate health states resulting from the two new diabetestreatments. The economic burden of a disease is usually divided into three components: direct medical costs, indirect costs, and intangiblecosts. Direct medical costs are the total cost of medical treatment.Indirect costs are the societal costs associated with the loss inproductivity due to illness and unpaid caregiver time. Intangiblecosts measure the patient's pain and suffering. Because wemeasured the health benefits of these technologies in terms ofQALYs, our estimates capture how ATP-funded technologieschange both the direct medical costs and the intangible costs of adisease. However, they may not capture changes in the indirectcosts. Improvements in the health of a patient population with aparticular illness or injury may reduce the indirect costs of thedisease, allowing those receiving an improved treatment to leadmore productive lives. These benefits to society may not becaptured by QALYs.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-27Data Limitations Because none of these technologies have yet reached the commercial market though several are in clinical trials the results of this analysis are based in part on the expectations of theinnovators and other informed individuals. We do not know at thistime whether these expectations will be realized. However, themethodology we employed can be used to update our estimates asbetter data on the actual costs and benefits of the projects becomeavailable. 1.5 CONCLUSIONS The primary objective of this project was to develop amethodology for estimating the expected social economic returnson public investment in ATP-funded projects with medicalapplications. To address the specific methodological challengespresented by new medical technologies, we used a currentlyaccepted framework for calculating private and social returns,incorporating nonmarket methods for valuing the benefits of thesetechnologies to patients. The second objective was to illustrate this methodology by applying it to seven ATP-funded projects in tissue engineering. Wehave demonstrated that this methodology is useful for analyzingATP-funded medical technologies, particularly under the followingconditions: ZOne or several primary applications are apparent. ZThe health outcome and resource cost differences between the new and defender technologies can be quantified (e.g.,because some clinical trials or other studies have producedthe required data). ZThe impact of changes in health outcomes on patients' well-being has been quantified by other studies (e.g.,QALYs for health outcomes or health states are available). ZThe market potential for the new technology is apparent. ZThe technology is sufficiently close to commercialization to enable company representatives to project the costs ofcommercialization and production.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 1-28Aside from medical technologies, this methodology is also applicable to other situations in which the technology affects goodsand services whose values are not adequately reflected in marketprices. For example, technologies that improve environmentalquality or reduce the crime rate provide benefits that are not tradedin traditional markets. Nonmarket valuation methods are requiredto quantify these kinds of social benefits. As in this study, valuationof these social benefits requires the methodology used indetermining the beneficiaries' willingness to pay for theseimprovements. The third objective of this project was to estimate the social return on public investment in seven ATP projects chosen for the casestudies and to estimate the impact of ATP funding on these returns.This analysis yielded the following findings: ZThe expected social return on ATP public investment in these technologies, or the increment to social returnsattributable to ATP funding, is estimated at $34 billion innet present value. ZThe expected social rate of return on ATP public investment in these technologies is estimated at an annual rate of 116 percent. ZThe expected total social return on public and private investment in these technologies is estimated at $112 billionin net present value, or an annual rate of 115 percent. ZThe expected total private return on investment in these technologies to ATP-award companies and their partners incommercialization and production is estimated at$1.6 billion in net present value, or an annual rate of12 percent. Of the $1.6 billion in net present value ofprivate returns, $914 million is estimated to be attributableto ATP funding. ZTo the extent that the technologies will yield applications in addition to those we investigated, it is likely that public andprivate returns on these projects will be higher. These results illustrate two important points about the role of ATP in funding these technologies: ZATP plays a significant role in increasing the expected social and private returns on these projects. ZThe social returns are far greater than the private returns. Private companies will therefore tend to underinvest inthese technologies relative to what would be optimal fromsociety's perspective. The wide disparity between socialAside from medical technologies, this methodology is alsoapplicable to intraditional markets.Chapter 1 \u2014 Overview 1-29and private returns indicates the importance of ATP's incentives to the private sector to pursue these technologies. Our final objective was to provide insight regarding the factors that affect the social return on public investment in projects withmedical applications. We found that three primary factors affectthe extent to which ATP funding influences social returns: Zthe number of years by which ATP funding accelerates the R&D phase of the project; Zthe impact of ATP funding on the probability of technical success; and Zthe impact of ATP funding on the scope of the project.2-12 Methodology Our approach to modeling the social and private returns to ATP funding in medical technologies is based on the methodologyrecommended by Mansfield (1996). We modify Mansfield'smethodology for the specific case of medical innovations. Inparticular, we use nonmarket methods to value the benefits of newmedical treatments. Our methodology focuses on evaluating the social return on public investment for ATP-funded projects. Determining the social returnon public investment requires that we estimate social return oninvestment under two scenarios: one with ATP funding and onewithout ATP funding. As described in Chapter 1 and illustrated inFigure 1-1, we developed the two scenarios by constructingtimelines of costs and benefits, including Zmedical benefits to patients, Zchanges in the cost of health care, Zrevenues to companies, Zprivate investment and costs, and Zpublic investment in ATP funding. The with-ATP scenario and the without-ATP scenario can differ with respect to three mechanisms of ATP impact: Zproject acceleration, Zprobability of technical success, and Zproject scope. This chapter provides additional detail regarding our methodology for constructing the two scenarios and calculating measures ofA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-2economic return. Section 2.1 describes how we constructed the timelines of investments and benefits from ATP-fundedtechnologies. Section 2.2 describes how we modeled the impact ofATP on the benefits of ATP-funded technologies. Sections 2.3, 2.4,and 2.5 discuss estimation of the three main components of socialreturns: Zmedical benefits to patients, Zchanges in the cost of health care, and Zcosts and revenues to private companies. In Section 2.6, we discuss how we calculated measures of social and private returns once the two scenarios of benefits and costs hadbeen constructed. Section 2.7 discusses the limitations of themethodology and suggests improvements. This chapter does not discuss the details of applying this methodology to each of the seven tissue engineering projectsanalyzed for this study. That discussion, together with the results ofthe analysis, is provided in Chapter 3. 2.1 THE TIMELINE OF R&D INVESTMENT COSTS AND BENEFITS One of the first challenges to modeling the social return on publicinvestment for ATP projects with medical applications was todevelop assumptions about the timing of the benefits and costs ofthe new technology. The timing of these benefits and costs isimportant because benefits and costs that occur earlier are morevaluable than those that are delayed. This is the basic principle ofdiscounting. Investments in new technology often do not result in benefits to society or private companies for a number of years. The cycle ofinvestment and benefits for a product or service based on a newmedical technology typically consists of three phases: ZR&D phase, Zcommercialization phase, and Zproduction phase. Discounting involves adjusting the values of future benefits and costs to render them comparable to the values placed on current benefits and costs. With discounting, the timing of benefits and costs becomes an important determinant of economic returns.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-3These three phases of the innovation process, which are illustrated in Figure 2-1, are not always sequential. However, this stylizedclassification mirrors the typical evolution of a biotechnologycompany. Early in the company's evolution, R&D activities\u2014applying resources and scientific principles toward solving atechnical problem\u2014are the primary focus. In thecommercialization phase that follows, the company invests in sales,marketing, and manufacturing infrastructure. These activities bringthe results of R&D in the form of specific technology applications tothe market. Product sales revenues become significant in theproduction phase as the company produces the product or servicethat embodies the innovation (Burill and Lee, 1992). 1 Companies and society realize the benefits of investments in R&D in this finalphase. Figure 2-1. The Timing of Costs and Benefits from Investments in New Technologies R&D Commer- cializationProductionYearst+10 t-+ 0Net Benefit ($) Public InvestmentPrivate InvestmentSocial Returns Private Returns 1We are speaking of the company narrowly as the business unit developing the new technology, under the assumption that it produces no other products.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-42.1.1 The R&D Phase During the R&D phase, firms invest in R&D to increase the probability of success on the project. Strategic R&D investmentmodels, such as those presented in Beath, Katsoulacos, and Ulph(1989); Loury (1979); and Lee and Wilde (1980), commonly assumethat the probability of success in any year is a function of the R&Dthat is spent in that year. Pr = f(R) (2.1) Empirical studies conducted by Griliches, Pakes, and Hall (1987) verified the plausibility of this assumption. They found a strongcontemporaneous relationship between aggregate R&Dexpenditures and patenting and an estimated elasticity of about 0.3.This aggregate relationship may not hold for specific projects, but itdoes provide guidance for our assumptions in this model.Similarly, while patenting activity may not be a perfect indicator ofthe success of a project relative to specific technical objectives, it isan indicator of technical success. Therefore, we assume that therelationship between R&D spending and technical success issimilar to that found in the empirical literature on the impact ofR&D on patenting. As R&D effort increases, the probability of discovering a technically viable solution also increases. However, the research is eventuallysubject to diminishing returns; each unit of effort or successivedraw from the distribution is less likely to yield a solution that issuperior to the best of the previous draws (Binswanger, 1978). 2 Thus, as shown in Figure 2-2, the marginal probability of technicalsuccess declines with increases in R&D effort. 2.1.2 The Commercialization Phase An innovative application proceeds to the commercialization phase if the R&D phase has been technically successful. In thecommercialization phase there is still no revenue from productsales. In many cases, identifying where R&D ends andcommercialization begins is difficult. The commercialization phase 2This result holds under the assumption that each draw is randomly selected. The rate of decline of return on investment in research is greater if researchersinvestigate potential solutions in order of their potential benefits.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-5Probability R&D EffortProbability of Technical Success Marginal Probabilitya) Total Probability b) Marginal ProbabilityProbability R&D Effort101 0 includes substantial investments in product development research\u2014for example, the research required for regulatory reviewor design of a production process. The key distinction between theR&D phase and the commercialization phase in our model is thatuncertainty relates to technical success in the R&D phase.Figure 2-2. The Total and Marginal Probability ofTechnical Success The probability of technical success increases with R&D effort but at a decreasing rate.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-6Uncertainty relates to market success in the commercialization phase. A company that conducts R&D may retain exclusive rights to marketing, manufacturing, and distribution; license the technologyto other companies that will retain these rights; or arrange someother type of agreement with a partner or licensee. 3 Regardless of the method the company uses to capture the benefits of its R&D,our definition of private returns includes the benefits and costs ofall three stages of the process. Thus, in our model, the privatereturn on investment includes spillover benefits between theinnovator and its partners in commercialization and production.The rationale for this assumption is explained more fully inSection 2.5. 2.1.3 The Production Phase The production phase includes all activities involved in producing the product or service that embodies the technology in sufficientquantities and consistency to meet quality standards at a pricecustomers are willing to pay. The company incurs costs forproduction and marketing and earns revenue from the sale ofproducts. Patients benefit from the new technology as doctorsadopt the new technology. As shown in Figure 2-1, both privateand social returns may become positive during this phase. This phase continues until the company ceases production of the product or service. Determining the length of the production phaseof a new technology is very difficult because it requires forecastingthe emergence of new products that may supersede the product orservice in question. We assume for this study that the companywill manufacture the good or service for 10 years following itsexpected introduction to the market in the with-ATP scenario. Thisis an issue of considerable empirical uncertainty. The actual lengthof the production phase depends on the emergence of newtechnologies that replace the technology in question. TheCommittee for Evaluating Medical Technologies in Clinical Use(1985) notes that researchers have observed a variety of patternsregarding the abandonment of medical technologies. Ten yearsseems to be a reasonable assumption in the absence of empirical 3Many choices lie between selling all rights and retaining exclusive rights.In our model, the private return on investment includes spillover benefits between the innovator and its partners in commercialization and production.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-7evidence. Empirical research about the rate of depreciation of new technologies and the longevity of their marketability couldcontribute to the accuracy of forecasts of social and private returns. 2.2 MEASURING THE IMPACT OF ATP ON TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT In our model, differences between the with-ATP and without-ATPscenarios include (1) the duration of the R&D phase, (2) private-sector R&D investment and its consequences for the likelihood oftechnical success, and (3) breadth of the technology's applications.The with-ATP scenario also incorporates the cost of ATP funding.This section explains how we modeled these three channels of ATPimpact. 2.2.1 ATP's Acceleration of R&D Previous studies of the impact of ATP indicate that ATP funding accelerates R&D and product introduction (Powell, 1996; Silber,1996). Acceleration influences net benefits in our model for tworeasons. First, future benefits are discounted, so benefits that occursooner are valued more than benefits that occur later. Second, acompany may have a limited window of opportunity forintroducing the new technology. Late introduction of a newproduct may reduce the time period during which the product issuccessful in the market because newer, competing technologieswill eventually come to market. In our model, R&D acceleration caused by ATP funding lengthens the period of market opportunity. We assume that a newertreatment or technology will replace the ATP-funded technology 10years after the expected commercialization date in the with-ATPscenario. Thus, if we expect a technology to reach the market in2000, we assume that a new technology will take its place in 2010.If the without-ATP scenario includes a 2-year project delay, marketintroduction does not occur until 2002, but the end of the marketopportunity window is still 2010. Thus, when ATP fundingaccelerates R&D by 2 years, the with-ATP scenario allows for 2additional years of benefits. When ATP funding accelerates the R&D process, the production phase, during which net social benefits are positive, begins sooner If ATP funding accelerates R&D and new product introduction, the social and private benefits accrue for a greater number of years.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-8and lasts for a longer time, so social returns are greater. In Figure 2-3, the solid line represents the with-ATP scenario, whilethe dotted line represents the without-ATP scenario. In thisexample, the with-ATP R&D phase lasts 3 years, as does thecommercialization phase. In the with-ATP scenario, productionbegins and benefits begin to accrue to the companies and to societyin year t. In the without-ATP scenario, the R&D spending is spreadover 5 years (total R&D may also be lower in the absence of ATPfunding). Thus, the commercialization and production phases aredelayed for 2 years, and benefits begin to accrue in year t+2.Because we assume the window of market opportunity closes atyear t+10, the without-ATP scenario includes 2 fewer years ofbenefits.

We calculated the expected value of net benefits by multiplying all costs and benefits that occur after the R&D phase by the probability of technicalsuccess. In our model, ATP funding affects the probability of technical success by increasing the level of R&D effort. ATP fundingdecreases the price of R&D to the firm, thus encouraging additionalR&D effort. As R&D effort increases, so does the probability oftechnical success. The degree to which ATP funding increases the probability of technical success depends on ZATP's impact on the cost of R&D to the firm, Zthe expected marginal benefit of R&D effort, and Zthe relationship between R&D effort and the probability of technical success. The Firm's R&D Investment Decision Companies invest in R&D to produce potential future profits. Following Binswanger (1978), we consider the R&D process asearch or sampling process in which scientists sample from adistribution of possible solutions to the problem they are trying tosolve. This sampling process requires the firm to expend realresources (e.g., labor services, capital services, materials). \"R&Deffort\" is a composite input combining these resources. IncreasingR&D effort increases the probability of finding a successfultechnology, which, in turn, increases the expected value of futureprofits. Firms determine the optimal level of R&D by equating theexpected marginal benefits and costs of R&D at the margin. The function representing marginal expected benefit of R&D effort is the firm's input demand function for R&D. As shown inFigure 2-4, the function is decreasing in R&D effort because ofdiminishing returns to R&D effort. The firm's optimal level of R&Dis the level at which the marginal cost of R&D effort equals themarginal benefit of R&D, or E* in Figure 2-4.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-10Figure 2-4. The Firm's Optimal Level of R&D Effort Benefit, Cost ($/R&D Effort) C E*Marginal Cost Marginal Benefit R&D Effort ATP's Impact on R&D Price and Investment The marginal cost of R&D effort is the cost of one additional unit of the composite input \"R&D effort.\" Assuming the components ofR&D effort are purchased in competitive markets, their unit costsare constant to the firm, and therefore the marginal cost of R&Deffort is constant (see Figure 2-4). The profit-maximizing firm willchoose the level of R&D effort at which the expected marginalbenefit equals the marginal cost. ATP funding reduces the marginal cost of R&D effort to the firm. Suppose that a dollar of R&D spending represents a composite unitof R&D effort, and that in the without-ATP scenario, the marginalcost of each unit of R&D effort is $1. If, in the with-ATP scenario, acompany receives $1 in ATP matching funds for every dollar itinvests in the project, then the marginal cost of R&D is reduced by50 percent to 50 cents. As shown in Figure 2-5, the reduction inthe price of R&D increases the firm's optimal level of R&D effortfrom E 1 to E 2.A firm's optimal level of R&D effort equates the marginal expected benefit of R&D with its marginal cost.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-11Figure 2-5. Impact of ATP Funding on R&D Effort R&D EffortBenefit, Cost ($/R&D Effort) C2C1 E2E1Marginal BenefitWithout ATP With ATP The impact of a change in the marginal cost of R&D effort on the quantity of R&D effort depends on the elasticity of the marginalbenefits function: lnE lnC = , (2.2) where is the elasticity of the marginal benefits curve, E is R&D effort, and C is the marginal cost of a unit of R&D effort. Thus, ifwe know the elasticity of the marginal benefit function and thechange in the marginal cost of R&D effort due to ATP funding, wecan determine the change in R&D effort. Because $1 of R&Dspending represents a composite unit of R&D effort, the resultingchange in R&D effort is equal to a change in R&D spending on theproject. The marginal benefit function is elastic if < -1; it is inelastic if -1 < < 0, and completely inelastic if = 0. As long as is not equal to zero, a decrease in the price of R&D will lead to anincrease in R&D effort. That is, unless the expected marginalbenefit curve is completely inelastic (vertical, with an elasticity of0), ATP funding must increase the total quantity of R&D effort.Unless the expected marginal benefits curve is completelyinelastic (vertical),ATP funding mustincrease the totalquantity of R&Deffort.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-12The elasticity of a project's marginal benefit function is difficult to estimate. Because no empirical estimates of the marginal benefitfunction or its elasticity were available for the tissue engineeringprojects we analyzed, we made the following assumptions aboutthe elasticity of the marginal benefits curve based on our interviewswith the companies: ZFor companies that indicated a significant reduction in the funding for the project in the absence of ATP, we assumethat their marginal benefit function is elastic with a valueof -2. ZFor companies that indicated that in the absence of ATP they would have proceeded with the project but undersome possible funding constraints, we assume that theirmarginal benefit function is relatively inelastic with a valueof -0.5. ZFor companies that told us that the absence of ATP funding would have made little or no difference in the project'sfunding level, we assume that the cost of R&D wasimmaterial to their decision to proceed with the project andthat the elasticity of the marginal benefit function is -0.01. Chapter 3 explains our assumptions for each company. R&D Effort and the Probability of Technical Success In our model, increases in R&D effort induced by ATP funding lead to increases in the probability of technical success. In keeping withthe empirical literature discussed in Section 2.1, we assume that theelasticity of the probability of technical success, P r, with respect to R&D effort, E, is equal to 0.3. Thus, lnPr lnE = 0.3. (2.3) This assumption allows us to estimate the difference between the with-ATP and without-ATP probability of technical success. 2.2.3 Widening the Scope of an ATP Project ATP funding can also widen the scope of a project. Additional resources from ATP funding may make it possible for a company toconsider additional applications of a technology or, for a givenapplication, expand the scope of research to include a widerpatient population. For example, additional research may adapt atreatment for special populations such as children or the elderly.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-13If ATP funding encourages a company to consider additional applications or patient populations, the with-ATP scenario shouldinclude the additional health benefits and costs. These increases inscope may increase both private and social returns. 2.3 EVALUATING MEDICAL BENEFITS TO PATIENTS ATP-funded medical technologies may improve the long-run healthoutcomes of thousands of patients per year with acute and chronicdiseases. They may also reduce the cost of health care. Themagnitude of the total health benefits of a new technology dependson the benefit per patient and the number of patients that will betreated. 2.3.1 Valuing Per-Patient Changes in Health Outcomes To derive an estimate of the per-patient value of changes in health outcomes attributable to new medical technologies, we followedthree steps: Z Step 1: Model the technology's impact on health outcomes Z Step 2: Quantify changes in health outcomes in terms of patient well-being Z Step 3: Determine the monetary value of patient changes in well-being Modeling Differences in Health Outcomes ATP supports technologies that are likely to have many applications. Each technology usually has an immediateapplication that is most likely to develop in the short term, as wellas applications that will probably develop later. The earlierapplications may be easier to analyze because the data regardingtheir impacts on health outcomes, resource use, the timing of theirdiffusion, and costs are more readily available and more reliablethan data regarding later and more uncertain applications. For this study, we analyzed one application for each technology the application that the companies believe has the greatest chance of near-term commercialization. However, laterapplications may also have a significant welfare impact; ourinability to model these later applications probably results in anA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-14underestimation of the social and private returns on investments in ATP-funded technologies. Mansfield (1996) emphasized the importance of clearly identifying the alternative technology when estimating the returns oninvestments in new technologies. For this study, the alternative tothe new medical technology the defender technology is the current treatment technology for the specific application of interest. Identifying a single defender technology for each application may lead to either understatement or overstatement of the benefits of thenew technology. For some diseases or injuries, the appropriatedefender technology may depend on the patient's age or medicalcondition. The less uniform the current treatment for eachapplication, the more serious the implications of assuming that asingle defender technology applies to all patients. In some cases,dividing the patient population into different groups according tothe most appropriate defender technology may improve theaccuracy of the results. After identifying the technology's application and its defender technology, we modeled the health benefits of each application.Some ATP-funded medical technologies affect the long-run healthoutcomes of patients with chronic diseases that progress over time.Other medical technologies affect acute illnesses and injurieswhose outcomes occur in a single period. We developed two basic models to capture these possibilities: the chronic disease model and the acute illness and injury model. The chronic disease model incorporates a Markov probability matrixthat contains the probabilities that patients transition from onehealth state to the next over time. The acute illness and injurymodel, which is actually a single-period case of the chronic diseasemodel, is similar to the traditional decision-tree frameworkcommonly used to assess the impact of health interventions. Chronic Disease Model. The chronic disease model, illustrated in Figure 2-6, employs a multiple-step process that is repeated in eachyear beginning with the first year in which the technology isavailable. The model calculates benefits of the new treatmenttechnology for patients receiving the new treatment over theremainder of patients' lives.The defender technology is the most widely usedcurrent treatmenttechnology for thespecific applicationof interest. The chronic disease model quantifies the impact of a new technology on the progression of a chronic disease over time. The acute illness and injury model quantifies the impact of a new technology on the health outcome of an acute illness or injury.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-15Figure 2-6.

The market forecastingmodel, described in Section 2.3.2, determines this allocation. In the second step, the patients are allocated among the health states associated with the disease. If there are k health states, thenthe number of patients in each health state in the first year defines avector y 1 for the defender technology and z1 for the new technology where the subscript 1 refers to the first year. Each health state is associated with a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) value and a treatment cost. We discuss QALYs below andtreatment costs in Section 2.4. The vector of QALYs associatedwith each health state is q, and the vector of costs associated with each health state is c. The total annual QALYs for all patients treated with the defender technology in the first year is y ' 1q; the total cost is y' 1c. For patients treated with the new technology, the annual QALY and cost totals are z' 1q and z' 1c, respectively. The transition probability matrix, X, for the defender technology and W, for the new technology, specify the probabilities of transitioning from one health state to another. For example, x 12 is the probability of moving from health state 1 to health state 2 whilebeing treated with the defender technology. X and W are two separate matrices because the transition probabilities can differbetween the new and defender technologies. At the end of each year, the vector of health states is multiplied by the transition probability matrix to determine the distribution ofpatients among health states at the beginning of the next year.Differences between X and W cause differences between the future health states of patients who are treated with the new technologyand patients who are treated with the defender technology. Thesedifferences between future health states cause differences betweenthe total QALYs and treatment costs for the new technology andthose of the defender technology. At the end of each year, some proportion of patients in the defender technology cohort is switched to the new technology. Thisproportion, together with the transition matrices, determines theallocation of patients among health states the next year for both thenew and defender technology.The chronic disease model quantifies differences between the new and defender technologies with respect to Zthe proportion of patients in each health state and Zthe patient's probability of moving from one health state to the next. It also incorporates the expected penetration of the new technology.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-17Acute Illness and Injury Model. Acute illnesses and injuries do not progress over time. The acute illness and injury model has many ofthe same elements as the chronic disease model, but it is muchsimpler: it is essentially a one-period chronic disease model. Figure 2-7 illustrates how a decision between the new and defender technologies leads to differences in the probability of healthoutcomes and also associated costs and benefits. The open squarenode represents the point at which a decision must be madebetween the new and defender technologies. Each branchfollowing the decision node is associated with a choice oftreatment technology and a treatment cost. For each technology,an open circle represents a chance node. Each branch followingthe chance node represents the outcomes associated with theillness or injury; each outcome is characterized by a probability, aQALY, and a cost. Figure 2-7.

We compared the expectedbenefits and costs of the two technology choices to determine thenet benefit of the new technology. Model Data. Below, we describe the data required to implement the health benefits models. Patient Cohorts . The chronic disease model examines a single cohort of patients and analyzes how this cohort transitions throughtime from one health state to the next. The patient cohort isdefined as the number of people diagnosed with the relevantdisease. Some patient populations change each year as some patients die or experience other changes in health status that remove them fromthe relevant population, while other patients are newly diagnosed.To simplify the model, we analyzed a constant patient cohort anddid not add newly diagnosed patients in later years. The number ofnew patients is probably small relative to the total pool of patientsat any one time. Thus, although the model ignores the benefits tothe newly diagnosed patients, the effect is probably relatively small.This methodology parallels common practice in clinical trials ofnew drugs and treatments (DCCTRG, 1996). In the acute illness and injury model, the relevant patient population is defined somewhat differently. Because acute illnessesand injuries do not progress over time, it is not necessary to track acohort's changes in health states. Therefore, the patient populationis the number of patients diagnosed with the particular injury orillness in that year. Information about the size of various patient populations is available from medical databases provided by medical researchorganizations, such as the American Diabetes Association, theAmerican Heart Association, the United Network for OrganSharing, and the National Institutes of Health. Health States. The chronic disease model allocates patients among the health states associated with the disease. For example, thehealth states associated with the nephropathy resulting fromdiabetes include no nephropathy, microalbuminceria,The acute illness and injury model describes how the new and defender technologies leads to different health outcomes and their associated QALYs costs. For most chronic diseases, the number of newly diagnosed patients is small compared to the pool of patients in any given year. For example, in 1996, the number of patients who could benefit from a new treatment for diabetes was 1.6 million. The number of new patients that enter this cohort each year is approximately 90,000. Thus, by following only the patients included in the first cohort, we underestimated the benefits, but by a small amount compared to the total benefits.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-19albuminceria, and end-stage renal disease. The initial allocation is based on information from medical databases about the share ofpatients in each health state at a given time. The transition matrixand the switching probabilities from the model determineallocations of patients across health states in subsequent years. The acute illness and injury model requires specification of final health outcomes rather than transitional health states, as in thechronic disease model. The acute illness and injury model assumesthat a health outcome is permanent. For example, if an injury andsubsequent treatment leave a patient with impaired function of ahand, the patient experiences this health outcome throughout life. Transition Probabilities. The transition matrices X and W in Figure 2-6 specify probabilities for transitions from one health stateto another. When a new technology affects the probability ofprogressing from one health state to another, the transitionprobability matrices differ between the new and defendertechnologies. The acute illness and injury model is a special case of the chronic disease model in which there is only one period. In the acuteillness and injury model, a vector of health outcome probabilitiesspecifies a probability for each health outcome. This vector maydiffer between new and defender technologies. Transition and health outcome probabilities may be difficult to obtain. For the defender technology, transition and outcomeprobabilities may be available from medical studies of theeffectiveness of the treatment. For the new technology, if noclinical trials have been completed, the only source of transitionand health outcome probabilities may be the expectations ofrepresentatives of the companies conducting the research. Switching Probability. For the chronic disease model, the switching probability specifies the proportion of patients switchedfrom the defender technology in each year. The switchingprobability is derived from a technology diffusion model that weestimate. The diffusion model is described in Section 2.3.2.The differences between the new technology transition matrix and the defender technology transition matrix reflect the impact of the new technology on the progression of the disease.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-20Quantifying Changes in Patient Well-Being The changes in health states or health outcomes identified by the acute and chronic disease models affect patient welfare. Theeconomic concept of individual welfare is \"utility,\" which is theindividual's subjective sense of well-being associated with aparticular action or condition. Our health benefits modelsincorporate QALYs as a measure of patient utility. This sectiondescribes QALYs and why they are appropriate measures ofwelfare. Then it discusses how health researchers determine QALYvalues for different health states or health outcomes. Quantifying Utility. Although utility is generally regarded as the proper conceptual measure of individual welfare, it isunobservable. An empirical surrogate is needed to provide acardinal measure of the value of the health benefits identified byour models. The observable utility surrogate that is typically usedin benefit-cost analyses is the maximum dollar amount theindividual would be willing to pay for the expected welfareimprovement or the minimum amount he/she is willing to accept toforego the improvement. Although willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) are not perfect surrogates for utility changes, the consensus amongeconomists is that WTP and WTA do provide the best availableutility surrogate (Tolley, Kenkel, and Fabian, 1994; Sloan, 1995;Haddix et al., 1996). An obvious problem with these measures isthat they are conditional on an individual's wealth or income.Different people with similar preferences for the benefits providedby new medical technologies could experience the same utilitychange but have different WTP or WTA values if their incomeswere different. In some cases WTP and WTA are revealed in markets. For example, when an individual purchases a commodity in a market,the monetary sacrifice is the price of the commodity. In such cases,price is the appropriate WTP/WTA value of the welfare change of aone-unit change in the individual's consumption rate of thecommodity. 4 4The price actually indicates the WTP for the marginal consumer. Inframarginal consumers earn consumer surplus on their purchases; their actual WTP ishigher than the price.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-21However, the prices of goods such as health care do not reflect the values of their benefits to patients. In this case, nonmarket methodsmust be used to value the benefits of health care. These methodsinclude Zexpressed preference, in which individuals are surveyed directly to elicit their WTP/WTA for the desirable change orto prevent an undesirable change, and Zrevealed preference, which uses market data and transactions for goods and services that include thenonmarket commodity as one of their attributes to estimatethe value of the commodity. For example, if, all else beingequal, people are willing to accept lower wages for workwith less risk of injury or illness, the wage difference is aproper WTP/WTA value of some of the health benefits ofthe less risky occupation. Although WTP provides the most comprehensive and theoretically consistent measure of the value of health outcomes, it is alsodifficult and expensive to implement. If neither expressed norrevealed preference estimates are available from empirical studiesfor the health outcome of interest, primary data must be collectedfrom individuals to assess their WTP/WTA values. This approach isoften not an option given the time and resource constraints of ananalysis. QALYs as a Measure of Utility. An alternative method for measuring utility for health benefits is to measure and value thechange in a patient's quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A QALYis a measure of the utility associated with health outcomes thatcombines morbidity and mortality into a single measure of annualwell-being. QALYs assign each health state a value between zeroand one, where zero corresponds to death and one to a year inperfect health. The scale is based on the idea that the value of ayear of life varies depending on a person's state of health. A year oflife in perfect health is worth more to a person than a yearexperiencing a chronic and painful disease. QALYs quantify thisdifference in well-being and therefore capture the effects of painand suffering. QALYs have been used extensively for cost-utilityanalyses of new medical treatments and are well accepted amongthe medical community. The Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Healthand Medicine recommends using QALYs to measure morbidity andmortality consequences of an intervention (Gold et al., 1996).Because the health care market is distorted by the intervention of third parties, market prices may not reflect the value of their resulting health outcomes; nonmarket valuation methods are required to quantify their value. A QALY is a measure of the utility associatedwith healthoutcomes thatcombines morbidityand mortality into asingle measure.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-22The economic burden of a disease is usually divided into three components: direct medical costs, indirect costs, and intangiblecosts. Direct medical costs equal the total cost of medicaltreatment. Indirect costs are the societal costs associated with lossin productivity due to illness and unpaid caregiver time. Intangiblecosts measure the costs due to the pain and suffering of the patient.QALYs are generally assume to measure the change in both thedirect medical costs and the intangible costs of a disease. Changesin indirect costs are generally not included in our estimates.However, there is some debate about whether QALYs actuallyinclude indirect costs; some researchers believe that whenproviding their QALY estimates, patients include indirect costs intheir estimates. Determining QALYs for Specific Health States. Health researchers collect QALYs from patients using sophisticated survey methods.The QALY values developed through these surveys are then used toquantify the impact of health states and health outcomes on theutility of a wider population. The extent to which the QALYsdeveloped from a sample are accurate predictors for the patients inthe study population depends on the extent to which the sample isrepresentative of the study population. Obviously, the best way toensure that QALYs are accurate for the study population is tointerview each patient in the study population to developindividual-specific QALY values. Because this is not usuallypossible, researchers aim to ensure that the sample is representativeof the population with respect to variables that they suspect willaffect QALY values. Because the time and resources did not permit it, we were not able to conduct direct surveys of the patient populations affected byeach of our case study technologies. Instead, we used averageQALY values available from other empirical studies. Table 2-1 listsavailable QALYs for a number of health states. When assigningQALYs for this study, we used the closest health state for whichQALYs were available. If possible, we used QALYs that weredeveloped especially for the patient population of interest.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-23Table 2-1.

Recently, economists have developed empirical methods to estimate the dollar value of reducing fatal and nonfatal health risks.We took advantage of previous work in this area, particularly thatof Mauskopf and French (1991) and Moore and Viscusi (1988b).They developed estimates of the value of a QALY for the averageperson based on WTP values for avoiding illness and accidents. 5 First, they determined the loss in QALYs associated with publishedWTP estimates. For example, a study by Moore and Viscusi(1988a) estimated the dollar value of avoiding immediatepremature death based on data on working men with an averageage of 40 years. The expected loss in life-years is 36 years,assuming a life expectancy of 76 years. If we assume perfect healthuntil death, then the QALYs lost are also 36 years. Thus, if themarginal dollar value of a life-year is constant, the dollar value ofone QALY can be estimated by dividing the dollar value ofavoiding premature death by 36. Alternatively, we can apply a 5The values developed by these studies represent average WTP values for a QALY among the U.S. population. The value that people place on a year of goodhealth is likely to vary by a number of factors, including income. WTP surveyscan be conducted for the specific population of interest to determine thatpopulation's value for a QALY. The averages used for this study are widelyused when population-specific values are not available.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-25discount rate to the remaining life-years, assuming that life-years in the near future are more highly valued. Then the WTP estimate isdivided by the total discounted life-years to determine the value ofa QALY. For this study, we used Moore and Viscusi's (1988a) estimate of $5 million for the value of avoiding premature death at age 40.This is also the mid-point of estimates reviewed by Fisher, Violette,and Chestnut (1989). Table 2-2 provides alternative values of aQALY under alternative assumptions regarding the QALY discountrate. These values are obtained by finding the 36-year annuityvalue of a $5 million principal at each discount rate. Thus, V = 5,000,000 t=136 1 1+dt(2.4) where V is the annual QALY value, d is the QALY discount rate, and t indexes the year. are made at the end of the year. Health economists disagree about the appropriateness of discounting QALYs. The issue in question is a patient's timepreference for quality of life and life-years. That is, should alife-year gained 10 years from now have the same value as onegained next year? If not, what is the appropriate discount rate? We followed the recommendations of Lipscomb, Weinstein, and Torrance (1996) who advise using a 3 percent discount rate andconducting sensitivity analysis on a range of discount rates. Thechoice of a discount rate is discussed in greater detail inSection 2.6.3.Table 2-2. Alternative QALY ValuesA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-262.3.2 Determining the Number of Beneficiaries The total medical benefits of a new technology and the revenues to private companies depend on the speed of the new technology'smarket penetration. The adoption of a new technology is typicallya function of the benefits of adoption to firms or consumers usingthe technology. Typically, firms and consumers do not adopt newtechnologies simultaneously; instead, innovations \"diffuse\" into useover time (Reinganum, 1989). Gradual diffusion is a result of the heterogeneity of firms or consumers. The expected benefits of adopting a new technologydepend on factors such as firm size, access to information, riskaversion, and others that differ among decisionmakers. In the caseof medical innovations, the decisionmakers include hospitals,physicians, and patients who are provided choices between thedefender technology and the new technology. We expect theheterogeneity of these decisionmakers to result in a gradualdiffusion process rather than simultaneous technology adoption. Diffusion models provide a summary statistical description of the adoption process. Empirical studies support an S-shaped diffusioncurve for the diffusion of new technologies (Mahajan and Peterson,1985). As shown in Figure 2-8, technological innovations typicallydiffuse slowly at first, with few adoptions occurring initially. Therate of adoption increases as early adopters and other factors, suchas information dissemination and advertising, influence others toadopt. The rate of adoption declines as the market potential isapproached. The classic diffusion model is the Bass model, or mixed influence model (Bass, 1969; Mahajan and Peterson, 1985), which containstwo parameters that characterize the diffusion curve. Figure 2-9illustrates the model and describes the coefficients and theirtheoretical interpretation. The coefficient of innovation, p,represents \"external influence,\" or adoptions due to the influence ofsome external activity, such as professional publications. Thecoefficient of imitation, q, represents the influence of word-of-mouth effects, or \"internal influence.\" Thus, the number of newadoptions (rate of change in cumulative adoptions) is proportionalto the difference between market potential, M(t), and the number ofThe total medical benefits of a new technology and therevenues to privatecompanies dependon the speed of thenew technology'smarket models are appropriate forforecasting thetemporal technologyadoption.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-27TimeCumulative [p + q A(t)/M(t)] [M(t) - A(t)] A(t) 0 0 p 1 - q, 0 q 1 - pNumber of new adoptions Coefficient of innovation or \"external influence\"Coefficient of imitation or \"internal influence\" Market penetration adopters remaining A(t). The proportionality factor [p + q A(t)/M(t)] is sometimes interpreted as the probability ofadoption at time t. The Bass model synthesizes the approaches ofMansfield (1961) and Fourt and Woodlock (1960). Their modelsare special cases of the Bass model. The Bass model is theoretically consistent with our expectations of the diffusion of biomedical innovations. Upon introduction to theFigure 2-8. The Classic Diffusion Curve Figure 2-9. Bass (Mixed- Influence) DiffusionModelA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-28market (and after Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approval), only a few physicians will use new medical innovations becauseexperience and knowledge about the procedures are limited.However, as information about the new techniques becomesavailable through professional papers, conferences, and word ofmouth, the diffusion rate will increase as more physicians adopt theinnovation. Finally, the rate of adoption will slow down as the totalmarket potential is approached. 6 One important limitation of this model is that the cumulativenumber of adopters, A(t), always increases over time. Actuallymost technologies begin to lose market share as new technologiesemerge and consumer needs and tastes change. For example, datafrom the Drug Mentions files produced by the National Center forHealth Statistics (NCHS) indicate that the rate at which doctorsprescribe new drugs for specific diagnoses has an inverted U-shape;the peak occurs about 10 to 15 years following FDA approval. 7 Ideally, we would forecast not only the rate of penetration of ATP-funded technologies, but also the rate of penetration oftechnologies that supersede them. For this study, we assume thatthe new technology will be completely superseded by a newertechnology after 10 years. Implementing the Bass diffusion model requires gathering data on M(t) and A(t), estimating the model, and using the model estimates to forecast the number of patients who will be treated with thetechnology. Collecting Model Data The following data are required to estimate the Bass model: ZM(t) = potential market size in year t and ZA(t) = the cumulative number of early adopters in year t. In our study, M(t) is the total relevant patient population in a given year. 6Trajtenberg (1990) notes that the government regulatory process has had a profound impact on the diffusion of CT scanners and that it is difficult to fit it toa specific functional form. The true diffusion process for these ATP innovationswill become apparent only in retrospect, when actual diffusion data can beexamined. 7Based on an unpublished analysis of the Drug Mentions files data by Frank Lichtenberg, Columbia University.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-29Ideally, ex post data would be available for A(t). For example, if the technology was introduced in 1992, data from 1992, 1993,1994, 1995, and 1996 would provide five observations for A(t). Inthe absence of ex post data, some forecast of A(t) must be developed. We obtained these forecasts from companyrepresentatives or from physician interviews. Expert interviews arecommonly used to forecast the penetration of new technologies; inthe case of medical technologies, physicians with clinical andresearch experience in the applications of interest are the bestexperts. Alternatively, forecasts of A(t) can be constructed byexamining the diffusion pattern of analogous technologies. Company representatives or professional associations and institutions (e.g., the American Diabetes Association and theNational Cancer Institute) helped us to identify physician expertswho specialize in the applications of interest, either in clinicalpractice, in research, or both. To familiarize the physicians with the technologies and to ensure that they were considering all aspects of the technologies in theirforecasts of A(t), we constructed clinical profiles of eachtechnology. Each profile contained a description of the technologyand information such as expected costs and outcomes compared tothe defender technology. We obtained permission from thedeveloping companies to provide this profile to physicians and didnot disclose the identity of the developing company. Appendix Aprovides examples of profiles we used to apply this methodology toseveral tissue engineering projects. Estimating the Diffusion Model Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression can be used to estimate a Bass model: a(t + 1) = [p+q \u009e where Za(t+1) is number of new adopters in the next year, ZA(t) is the cumulative number of adopters in year t, ZM(t) is the total market potential in year t, and ZA(t+1) = A(t) + a(t+1).Data for the Bass model can include observations of the actual early market penetration of a technology or forecasts of market penetration by technology experts.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-30Rewriting Eq. (2.5) provides the estimated equation: a(t + 1) = p [M(t) - A(t)] + q A(t) - 1 M(t) A(t)2 . (2.6) Using data collected from physician interviews and company representatives, we estimated p and q using OLS. In keeping withthe structure of the Bass model, we suppressed the intercept. The forecast equation is ^a(t + 1) = ^p [M(t) . (2.7) Forecasts of A(t) for Years 2 through 10 were constructed by inserting estimates of p and q into the equation above. Confidenceintervals of 95 percent can be constructed around forecasts of A(t)to provide a measure of the uncertainty of the results. However,note that we used expert forecasts to estimate the model. Theseforecasts are subject to unmeasurable error; thus, traditionalmeasures of forecast error do not fully capture the error associatedwith these estimates. 2.4 ESTIMATING CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS Our analysis of the impact of new technologies on the cost ofhealth care uses the structure of the chronic disease model and theacute illness and injury model presented in Section 2.3. Recallthat, in each year, the distribution of patients among the healthstates differs between the new and defender technologies. Eachhealth state imposes a treatment cost; the vector c in Figure 2-1 specifies these costs. Thus, the total cost of treating all patients in agiven year is the product of the cost vector and the patientallocation vector. For year 1, TC 1 D = y'1c and TC1 N = z'1c (2.8) where TC1 D is the cost of health care under the defender technology in year 1 and TC1 N is the cost of health care using the new technology in year 1. The cost of treating someone in a given health state can differ between the new and the defender technologies if the newtechnology affects the method of treatment for a given health state.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-31Eq. (2.8) includes the costs associated with treating the health states or health outcomes resulting from each technology, but it does notinclude the cost of the treatment itself. Thus, if the cost of using thenew technology is different from the cost of using the defendertechnology, we added this cost difference to the model. Whereappropriate, we also incorporated the costs of treating the sideeffects and complications of each treatment. Chapter 3 discussesthe specific costs associated with the diseases and illnessesconsidered in this study. 2.5 CALCULATING RETURNS TO PRIVATE COMPANIES Companies invest in R&D to pursue new technologies because, ifsuccessful, the technology will provide a stream of future profits.Expected private returns depend on the following factors: Zprobability of technical success; Zexpected investments and costs for X R&D, X commercialization, and X production; and Zexpected revenues. In this model, private return on investment includes the investments and revenues of the innovator as well as other companies that mayplay a role in commercializing and producing the technology. Thisdefinition of private returns is somewhat different from the onecommonly used in the literature. Normally, private returns to R&Drefer to the returns to the innovator, while returns to downstreamcompanies are \"spillovers\" and are counted as part of social returnsbut not private returns. Companies that receive ATP funding may specialize in one phase of the innovation process while developing contractualrelationships with other companies that participate in other phases.Companies that specialize in R&D activities do not incur the costsof commercialization and production. Their benefits are limited tolicensing fees, royalties, or the sale of patents to other firms thatwill commercialize and manufacture the new technology.In this model, the private return on investment includes the expected investments and revenues of the innovator as well as other companies that may play a role in commercializing and producing the technology.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-32Our model includes the costs and benefits from all three phases in our definition of private returns regardless of whether the ATP-sponsored firm is responsible for all of these activities. The earlystage of many of these ATP projects makes it difficult to predict theR&D, marketing, and production relationships that will emergeamong our case study companies and, therefore, the distribution ofbenefits among them. Thus, our definition of private returnsaggregates the costs and revenues of the initial innovator and othercompanies that play a role in commercialization. Provided theestimates of private return on investment are interpreted correctlyas returns to all private companies participating in R&D,commercialization, and production, this assumption has no impacton the empirical results. Constructing the schedule of expected benefits and costs for the private sector requires the following information for both the with-ATP scenario and the without-ATP scenario: ZR&D investment for each year of the R&D phase, Zinvestment in commercialization for each year of the commercialization phase, Zannual expenditures on the fixed and variable costs of production, Zannual revenue, and Zprobability of technical success. 2.5.1 Determining R&D Investment We assume that the company's R&D investment in the ATP project is equal to its contribution to the ATP project's total budget\u2014that is,the total project budget minus the amount funded by ATP. This assumptions reflects a narrow view of private-sector R&D investment. An alternative views R&D as a production processwhose inputs include the stock of the company's knowledgeresulting from previous R&D in related projects. Thus, at least aportion of the R&D invested in previous related projects should becounted as an investment in the current project. Nevertheless, we applied the more practical, narrower approach to determining R&D investment because of the lack of data fordetermining the total quantity of R&D invested in a generalresearch area. This may result in an underestimate of the The private sector's R&D investment in the with-ATP scenario is equal to its matching funds for the ATP project. R&D investment in the without-ATP scenario is determined by the model as described in Section 2.2.1.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-33company's investment in ATP-funded technologies. As a consequence, the resulting estimates of social and private returnsmay be biased upward for some projects, especially those in whichthe ATP project builds on accomplishments of previous R&D by thesame company. On the other hand, knowledge spillovers fromthese ATP projects to other projects are also likely. In fact, ATPprojects are chosen because of their potential to lead to advances inscience and technology that enable advances in other areas. Ourestimates do not account for these spillover benefits, which bias theestimates of social and private returns downward. 2.5.2 Determining Costs of Commercialization and Production Our model includes costs incurred during the commercialization phase due to activities such as preparing for regulatory review,developing marketing networks, building production capacity, anddeveloping supplier networks. In our model, companies do notincur these expenses unless the project is technically successful.The commercialization phase begins at the completion of the ATPproject period and ends when the project is brought to market. ATP funding recipients may not be able to provide an estimate of the cost of conducting these activities, particularly if their projectsare still in the R&D phase. In this case, assumptions about therelationships between these costs and available companyinformation must be developed. We derived our assumptions about these costs from industry profiles. According to a composite balance sheet of thebiotechnology industry, selling, general, and administrativeexpenses represent about 37 percent of total revenue (Lee andBurill, 1996). We used this information to construct a timeline ofcommercialization costs. We assume that some of these costs arefixed and the company incurs them in the commercializationphase. Another portion is variable and the company incurs themannually in conjunction with production. If represents the portion of these costs incurred prior to production, the fixedcommercialization costs are CC F = *0.37 * t=1n TRt(2.9)A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-34where CC F represents the fixed portion of commercialization costs, TRt is total revenue in year t, and n is the number of years of production. If the commercialization phase is longer than 1 year,we spread the fixed costs over the commercialization phase. Forour case studies of ATP-funded tissue engineering technologies, weassume that = 0.25; thus, 25 percent of total commercialization costs are fixed and incurred during the commercialization phase;the remainder occur during the production phase. Our model also includes the cost of additional research required in the commercialization phase to bring the technology to market,such as the costs of conducting the research required for regulatoryreview. Several of our case study companies provided estimates ofthese costs. For those that could not, we developed an estimatebased on average R&D spending in the industry. For thepharmaceutical industry, R&D spending accounted for 12.5 percentof revenue in 1993 (NSF, 1996). Thus, we assume that totalresearch spending, including the total ATP project budget, equals12.5 percent of revenue: CC R = 0.125 - RA - RC (2.10) where CC R represents the portion of commercialization costs due to additional research. R A is public investment of ATP funds to the project, and R C is the company's contributions to the ATP budget. Again, if the commercialization phase is longer than 1 year, wespread these costs over the entire commercialization phase. We also developed estimates of production costs from industry data. According to a composite balance sheet of the biotechnologyindustry, the ratio of production costs (including capitaldepreciation) to the value of shipments is 0.42 (Lee and Burill,1996). Because the costs included in the numerator of this ratioinclude capital depreciation, there is no need to account for thefixed costs of plant and equipment elsewhere. Thus, we assumethat production costs equal 42 percent of revenue. Ideally, we can replace these assumptions about the relationship between revenue and the costs of commercialization andproduction with actual data from the companies as it becomesavailable. Because these assumptions are based on an aggregateRather than explicitly including a fixed cost of the plant and equipment, we used a production cost estimate that incorporates the cost of capital depreciation.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-35balance sheet of the biotechnology industry, they do not reflect differences among segments of the industry or the specific situationof the ATP-sponsored companies and their partners. As thebiotechnology industry matures, its aggregate balance sheet mayshow some reduction in R&D and commercialization costs whileproduction costs as a percentage of revenue may increase. Howwell these assumptions fit the companies in our case study dependson their stage of development relative to the industry. 2.5.3 Calculating Revenues Revenue is equal to the per-unit price multiplied by the quantity sold. We derived our estimates of the quantity of sales for thegoods embodying each technology from the diffusion modeldescribed in Section 2.4. ATP-funded companies provided anestimate of the price of the product or service embodying the ATP-funded technology. The companies sometimes based theseestimates on the cost of the defender technology. If the companies'goal is to provide the product or service at the same or lower costthan the defender technology, the price of the defender technologyguided their estimate of the expected price. 2.5.4 Estimating the Probability of Technical Success Assessing the probability of technical success for ATP projects in tissue engineering is very difficult, especially for projects that arerelatively young. We derived our estimates of the probability oftechnical success from the companies' own assessments of theirprogress toward demonstrating the technical feasibility of their ATPprojects, as reported in quarterly and anniversary business reports.We adjusted their estimates to account for the projects' expectedcompletion dates: P r = TP/PF (2.11) where TP represents the percentage of progress the companies have made toward demonstrating technical feasibility, and PF is thepercentage of the projects' calendar time that had elapsed at thetime TP was assessed. 8 8Ideally, we would use the percentage of the project budget spent at the time technical progress was assessed; however, this information was not available.We used the companies' own assessment of their progress toward demonstrating the technical feasibility of the project as a proxy of the probability of technical success. We adjusted this assessment to account for the percentage of project R&D that has been completed.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-36In their quarterly and anniversary business reports, companies report their progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of theirtechnical goals. The companies report a range (e.g., 0 to25 percent). We used the midpoint of the range for the value of TP.We calculated PF as the ratio of the elapsed project time to the totalproject period. For example, suppose one of the ATP-fundedcompanies reported in its business report that it had made 25 to50 percent progress toward demonstrating technical feasibility.Also suppose that at the time the company filed the report,50 percent of the ATP project period had elapsed. Then theprobability of technical success is 0.375 0.5 = 0.75. This method of estimating the probability of technical success has important limitations. Even the companies cannot predict whetherthey will meet all of their technical goals. Furthermore, our methodof adjusting the company assessments to account for the status ofthe projects can result in probabilities greater than one. Clearly, amore robust method for determining this probability is needed. Thesensitivity of our results to our estimates of the probability oftechnical success is reported in Appendix B. We determined the probability of technical success in the without- ATP scenario by applying the model described in Section 2.2.1.This model determines the change in the probability of technicalsuccess as a function of the change in R&D spending. 2.6 CALCULATING MEASURES OF ECONOMIC RETURN After gathering the data and completing the modeling activities, wecalculated measures of economic return from three perspectives:the social return on public investment, the social return on publicand private investment, and the private return on privateinvestment. Measures of economic return on investments in ATP-funded technologies can be calculated from the time profile of benefits andcosts to the public and to the private sector in each scenario. WeChapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-37used four steps to develop the measures of social and private returns: 1. Construct the time profile of benefits and costs for the with- ATP and without-ATP scenarios. 2. Choose measures of economic return.3. Choose a discount rate.4. Conduct sensitivity analysis on key parameters. 2.6.1 Constructing the Time Profile of Benefits and Costs for Each Scenario The with-ATP and without-ATP scenarios specify the expected private and social benefits and costs in each year. The first year ofthe scenario is the first year in which benefits or costs are incurred(e.g., Year 1 of the ATP project funding). The last year of thescenario is defined as the final year of the production phase.Determining the last year of the scenario requires speculation aboutthe emergence of new technologies that may replace the ATP-funded technology. As explained in Section 2.1, we assume thatthis occurs 10 years after expected market introduction in the with-ATP scenario. The annual net benefit to the private sector is the difference between annual revenues and annual costs to the innovator and itspartners. The annual net benefit to society is equal to the netbenefit to the private sector, minus ATP funds provided bytaxpayers, plus net benefit to patients, plus net benefit due tochanges in the cost of health care. During the R&D phase, theexpected net benefit to both the private sector and society is thesame as the net benefit. In the years after the R&D phase, theexpected net benefit is the product of the probability of technicalsuccess and the net benefit. To calculate the social return on public investment, we calculated the difference between the expected net benefit to society for thewith-ATP scenario and the expected net benefit to society for thewithout-ATP scenario for each year: IENB t = ENBw t - ENBwo t(2.12) where IENB t is the incremental expected net benefit in year t, ENBw t is the with-ATP expected benefit in year t, and ENBwo t is theThe relevant time horizon for evaluating the R&D investment depends on our expectations for the emergence of a new technology that will replace the ATP-funded technology.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-38without-ATP expected net benefit in year t. We used the annual values of IENB t to calculate the social return on public investment. All the data in our model are expressed in constant (1996) dollars. We adjusted any data that were denominated in pre-1996 dollarsby applying either the consumer price index (CPI) or, for medicalexpenses, the medical care component of the CPI. 9 2.6.2 Choosing Measures of Economic Return NPV and IRR are appropriate choices for measuring the net benefits of ATP projects because they have been widely used to evaluatepublic-sector research and can provide comparable estimates.They are also commonly used in the private sector to estimate thepotential benefits of alternative investment projects. NPV provides the most straightforward method for evaluating the economic impact of a project. NPV is NPV = t=1n NBt (1+r)t(2.13) where NB t is the net benefit (benefit minus cost) in year t, n is the number of years over which benefits or costs accrue, and r is aprespecified discount rate. An NPV greater than zero indicates thatthe discounted value of the benefits of investing the technology isgreater than the discounted value of the costs. Although NPV is themost correct measure of the economic value of a project, it doesnot allow for comparisons across projects of different sizes. The correct discount rate to apply to the NPV calculation is the subject of a great deal of debate, especially for cases in which someof the benefits are health related. Section 2.6.3 provides adiscussion of the issues relevant to choosing a discount rate. Asdescribed below, the sensitivity of the empirical results should betested for their sensitivity to the discount rate assumption. The IRR is another commonly used measure of the economic benefits from an investment. The IRR is the interest rate that forces 9Cutler et al. (1996) assert that the medical care CPI overstates inflation in medical care costs. However, we believe that some of the shortcomings of the medicalcare CPI (e.g., lack of adjustment for changes in quality) are mitigated by ourexplicit accounting for changes in the patient's benefits from new treatmenttechnologies.NPV and IRR are appropriate choices for measuring public- and private-sector research because they have been widely used to evaluate public-sector research and are also commonly used in the private sector.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-39the NPV of the project's expected net benefits to be 0. Thus, to calculate the IRR, we set Eq. (2.13) to zero and solve for r. An IRR that refers to the costs and benefits to the company receiving ATP funding and its partners is called the private rate ofreturn (PRR). An IRR that refers to the benefits and costs to allstakeholders is called the social rate of return (SRR). The IRR canbe interpreted as a percentage yield occurring over a defined periodof time. One benefit of the IRR over NPV is that it does not requireselection of a discount rate. However, we do need to compare theIRR to an appropriate discount rate or to an alternative project todecide whether the project is socially desirable. The IRR suffers from several potential shortcomings for evaluating investments in technologies. These shortcomings, which have beendiscussed by Tassey (1996), include its bias toward projects thatprovide benefits earlier in the study period and its failure toconsider explicitly the reinvestment rate of interim receipts. Weconsidered the IRR's bias toward earlier payoff projects bycalculating both a rate of return and an NPV for each project. A potential solution to the IRR's failure to consider the reinvestment rate of interim receipts is to use the \"adjusted\" IRR, or AIRR. TheAIRR was defined by Ruegg and Marshall (1990) as the annualcompound percentage yield from a project over the study period,taking into account the rate for reinvestment in interim receipts.Calculating the AIRR requires choosing a reinvestment rate.However, it may be conceptually faulty to assume that the returnsfrom medical innovations can be reinvested. A large portion ofthese benefits are benefits to patients who enjoy a better quality oflife than they would in the absence of these new innovations. Itseems inappropriate to assume that these benefits, which areembodied in patients' well-being, can be reinvested. Thus, wechose not to calculate the AIRR. We calculated social return on public investment and social return on investment using both NPV and PRR for each project. Inaddition, we calculated composite measures of NPV and IRR. Wecalculated the composites by summing the total expected netbenefits and costs for each year for all the projects:We considered the IRR's bias toward earlier payoffprojects bycalculating both arate of return and anNPV for eachproject.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-40NBt = j=17 NBj,t (2.14) where j indexes the project. Then we substituted Eq. (2.14) into Eq. (2.13) to calculate the NPV and IRR for all projects takentogether. The composite NPV and IRR combine the benefits and costs from all projects. The first year of benefits or costs from any project is1992; the final year is 2011. Thus, the composite benefits and costsoccur over a 20-year time period. The composite NPV is not equalto the sum of the individual project NPVs because no single projecthas benefits and costs over all 20 years. 2.6.3 Choosing a Discount Rate We consulted several sources to consider the merits of alternative discount rates. As discussed in OMB Circular A-94 and in Gold etal. (1996), OMB recommends discounting all costs and benefits in acost-benefit analysis at the real rate of 7 percent, which, accordingto OMB Circular A-94, \"approximates the marginal pretax rate ofreturn on an average investment in the private sector in recentyears\" (p. 9). However, for discounting costs to government (e.g., in a cost- effectiveness analysis) OMB recommends using \"the real treasuryborrowing rate on marketable securities of comparable maturity tothe period of analysis.\" The rates most recently published by OMBfor this purpose range from 2.1 percent for 3-year projects to2.8 percent for 30-year projects. Their rationale for using this ratefor a cost-effectiveness analysis is that these analyses seek to findthe lowest-cost way for government to achieve some predesignatedobjective. The basic difference between these two OMB recommendations relates to risk. The 7 percent assumption was developed by OMBas an average rate that theoretically combines the riskless rate,which they recommend for discounting costs to society in cost-effectiveness analysis, with a risk-adjusted rate, which is normallyused to discount private investments that have high opportunitycosts and high risks. Thus, if we did not adjust private costs for riskBecause the expected net benefit is used to calculate NPV, and because all benefits and costs have been converted to constant dollars, a riskless real discount rate should be used to determine the NPV.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-41(if we were discounting a stream of uncertain costs and benefits), we might want to use the 7 percent recommended by OMB. However, the Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine has examined OMB's recommendations, as well as therecommendations of scores of empirical and theoretical researchersin health benefits analysis, and has recommended the following: Zfirst convert all uncertain costs and benefits into \"certainty equivalents,\" expressed in real terms, and Zdiscount at a selected riskless real discount rate (Gold et al., 1996). Assuming risk neutrality, the certainty equivalent is equal to the real expected net benefits, which we have calculated bymultiplying the real net benefits by the probability of technicalsuccess. Risk neutrality is a common assumption when quantifying medical benefits (Gold et al., 1996). It is convenient operationally becauseit implies that the certainty equivalent of benefits is equal to theexpected value. This implies that patients are indifferent betweentwo events with the same expected value. We do not know theactual risk preferences of the patients affected by thesetechnologies. Because we did not have the resources necessary toexplore the risk preferences of the specific populations of interest inthis study, we followed the conventional practice and assumed riskneutrality. The riskless rate recommended by the Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine is 3 percent (Gold et al., 1996). This isbased on the recommendations of a number of researchers,including Viscusi (1995). The Panel also recommends the following: Zdiscounting costs and benefits at the same rate and Zconducting sensitivity analysis at 5 percent because many other studies have used 5 percent as their base case. In our analysis of ATP projects in tissue engineering, we followed the Panel's recommendations. We Zassumed risk neutrality and developed the certainty equivalent by multiplying the net returns by the probabilityof success,A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-42Zdiscounted costs and benefits at the same rate, Zdiscounted social and private returns at the same rate (since they have been risk-adjusted), Zused the 3 percent discount rate, and Zconducted sensitivity analysis for discount rates of 1 and 5 percent. 2.6.4 Conducting Sensitivity Analysis Because many of the variables in a model of the returns on investment in ATP-funded medical technologies are measured withconsiderable uncertainty, it is important to test the sensitivity of ourresults to specific parameter values. Sensitivity analysis can beconducted in a variety of ways. The results can simply becalculated for a range of values for each of the parameters ofinterest. Alternatively, Monte Carlo simulation, using a programsuch as @RISK, allows the analyst to incorporate measures ofuncertainty of the parameters to generate the probabilitydistribution functions for the results. We tested our results with respect to changes in the following parameters: Zdiscount rate, Zper-patient treatment costs and QALYs, Zprobability of technical success, Zcommercialization cost parameters, ZR&D cost parameters, Zproduction cost parameters, and Zproduct price. Appendix B contains the results of these sensitivity analyses. 2.7 METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS Implementing the methodology described in this report is challenging. Analysts face a number of difficulties regardingmodeling and data collection in each of the implementation steps.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-432.7.1 Characterizing New and Defender Technologies A significant challenge is choosing the applications to study. Choosing to analyze the most immediate and probable applicationis the most practical approach and probably provides the mostreliable data. However, ignoring the later applications probablyunderestimates the project's benefits. A potential approach to this problem may be to draw from existing or prospective studies of project spillovers. An empirical analysisof trends in the return on investment in the application of anenabling technology as it ages may provide a general guideline forforecasting the return on investment for later applications. Forexample, a retrospective study of the medical applications resultingfrom the discovery of imaging technology might show that thereturn on investment in each application rise at first, then decline asthe enabling technology ages and is replaced by a new discovery. Until this type of information is available, the best approach to capturing return on investment from future applications in theabsence of data is to describe the applications qualitatively, as wehave for the seven tissue engineering projects. A discussion of theirpotential returns in relation to the application that is studied canalso provide some perspective on the potential unmeasured returns.For example, we studied the tumor imaging application of thediscovery of a new molecule. While tumor imaging is the mostlikely commercial success in the short run, the potential of thismolecule to assist in discouraging tumor growth has potentialimplications that go far beyond its potential as a diagnostic tool. 2.7.2 Modeling Medical Benefits The most challenging task in modeling medical benefits is quantifying the benefits of new technologies to patients. Themethodology described in this report uses QALYs to measure thechange in a patient's welfare due to changes in their health status.However, this method is limited by the insensitivity of QALYs tosmall or short-term changes in a patient's health status. Thisprevented us from calculating the full health benefits of sometechnologies.Existing or prospective studies of project spillovers may provide a general guideline for forecasting the return on investment from later applications of ATP-funded technologies.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 2-44The alternative is to collect WTP estimates for each change in health status. Although WTP provides the most comprehensive andtheoretically consistent measure of the value of health outcomes, itis also the most difficult and expensive to implement. In theabsence of WTP estimates of the value of utility losses associatedwith each of the outcomes relevant to the applications of ourtechnologies, we would need to collect primary data fromindividuals to assess their WTP values. This approach is often notan option given the time and resources available for a study. Its usemust be dictated by the importance of the most accurate healthbenefits information, given the other limitations of the analysis. 2.7.3 Forecasting Market Penetration While the Bass model is a generally accepted model for forecasting the diffusion of new technologies, it has one important drawbackfor studying ATP-funded enabling technologies. The cumulativenumber of adopters predicted by the Bass model is strictlyincreasing over time. Yet the market penetration of technologiesmay fall after it peaks as new technologies emerge and consumerneeds and tastes change. Thus, a diffusion model is needed thataccounts for the future emergence of technologies that will replacethe ATP-funded technology. One way to think of such a model isthat it actually forecasts the diffusion of two technologies: the ATP-funded technology and its replacement. Clearly, knowledge ofthese potential replacements would be limited. It would be helpfulto develop data about the likely pattern of obsolescence of ATP-funded technologies. 2.7.4 Estimating Company Costs and Revenues Estimating company costs and revenues requires information about the expected costs of R&D, production, and commercialization.This information is extremely difficult to collect. Many of theseprojects are years from commercialization, and many of thecompanies will license these technologies rather than produce andmarket them. Even if companies can provide estimates of thesecosts, they may not because they are concerned about theconfidentiality of data such as product price and production costs.Although industry balance sheets and other secondary data can beused to develop assumptions about these costs, these assumptionsmay be misleading because they do not account for the specificQALY measures are not sensitive enough to capture small or short-term changes in health states. Although the WTP method provides a comprehensive and theoretically consistent alternative, it is also the most difficult to implement.Chapter 2 \u2014 Methodology 2-45circumstances of each company. Furthermore, the biotechnology industry is very young. As the industry matures and becomes moreprofitable, the ratios between sales and these costs will probablychange. It may be useful to refine our techniques for interviewing company representatives to improve our estimates of these costs. Forexample, if the company produces other products, we may be ableto infer some information about costs for developing the ATPtechnology from the history of the development of other products.Similarly, we may be able to consider the historical costs ofcommercialization and production of an existing product that usesa current process technology and serves similar markets. 2.7.5 Calculating Social and Private Returns Constructing a without-ATP scenario is the most challenging task in calculating social and private returns. Because the without-ATPcase is the counterfactual, we must rely on the company'sconjectures about what they might have done in the absence of anATP grant and on a model that predicts the results of that behavior.Better information about how companies respond to such fundingcould improve our models and our estimates of the without-ATPscenario.3-1Tissue Engineering3 Case Studies One of the objectives of this project was to illustrate the methodology described in Chapter 2 by applying it to seven ATP-funded projects in tissue engineering. Another objective was toestimate the social return on public investment in the seven ATPprojects chosen for the case studies. This chapter describes indetail how we applied the methodology described in Chapter 2 toeach of the seven case studies. It also reports the results of theanalysis and discusses the limitations of each case study. Finally,we offer conclusions about the suitability of the methodology, theexpected social and private return on investment in tissueengineering technologies, and the role of ATP in improving thosereturns. 3.1 CASE STUDY APPLICATIONS ATP asked RTI to apply the methodology described in Chapter 1 toa single application of each of seven multiple-application tissueengineering projects funded from 1990 to 1996. Chapter 1 brieflydescribes these seven projects, and Table 1-1 provides summaryinformation. At the request of the ATP staff, we spent a greater share of our effort and resources modeling and collecting data for the first fourprojects listed in Table 1-1. ATP based their selection of these in-depth case studies on the likelihood that key data would beavailable either from the companies or from other sources. Forthese projects, we used a more detailed medical benefits modelingstrategy, spent more time searching for secondary data in theA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-2medical literature, and collected more data for the diffusion forecasts. We consulted a number of sources for data and information, including Zinterviews with company representatives, ZATP proposals and progress reports, Zinterviews with physicians, Zmedical databases and journals, and Zpublicly available company and industry information.

Tohonor our confidentiality agreement with these companies, we donot discuss this information. 3.1.1 Human Stem Cell and Hematopoietic Expansion Systems Aastrom Biosciences Inc.'s ATP project is developing a CPS to be used in stem cell therapy to make the collection of stem cells easierand more convenient to the donor or patient. Stem cell therapy isoften used to enable cancer patients to endure high-dose ormulticycle chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The stem cells areremoved from the patient prior to the therapy and replacedafterwards to restore the patient's hematopoietic system. Table 3-2summarizes the assumptions of our analysis of this project. Timeline of R&D Costs and Benefits Our model assumes that the relevant time horizon for this project is 1992 to 2009. The 2-year R&D period begins in 1992. AastromBiosciences expects that its CPS will enter the market in 2000.Thus, the commercialization phase begins in 1994 and ends in1999. The production phase lasts 10 years, beginning in 2000 andending in 2009. Aastrom estimates that ATP funding accelerated the project by 1 to 2 years. Using the conservative estimate of 1 year of acceleration,the without-ATP scenario includes an R&D phase that lasts 3, ratherthan 2, years. The commercialization phase begins in 1995 and theproduction phase begins in 2001. However, because the windowof market opportunity ends in 2009, the production phase in thewithout-ATP scenario is only 9 years. Impact of ATP on Social Returns ATP awarded Aastrom $1,220,000 in matching funds. Aside from the 1-year acceleration effect discussed above, ATP funding alsoaffected the expected probability of success for this project. Recallthat the change in the probability of technical success due to ATPfunding depends on how ATP funding affects the total spending in ATP funding accelerated this project by 1-year and increased the probability of technical success by 9 percent.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-4Table 3-2.

This estimate applies only to the U.S. market.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-5the R&D phase. This depends on the elasticity of the marginal benefits function. Our conversations with Aastrom officialsindicated that although ATP funding was important to the projectAastrom would have proceeded with the project even in theabsence of ATP funding. Thus, we assume that the marginalbenefits function was relatively inelastic, with an elasticity of -0.5.Using this elasticity and Eq. (2.2), we estimate that in the absenceof ATP funding total spending in the R&D phase would havetotaled $2,034,520, rather than $2,734,000, which was spent inthe with-ATP scenario. Applying this change in spending toEq. (2.3), we estimate a 9 percent increase in the probability oftechnical success in the with-ATP scenario over the without-ATPscenario. Aastrom reported no impact on the scope of the project. However, Aastrom did indicate that the ATP funding helped position them toobtain other sources of funding. This \"halo effect\" of ATP fundingmay have affected Aastrom's cost of capital, their total R&Dspending, and the probability of technical success. We did notexplicitly quantify this effect; thus, we have probablyunderestimated the impact of ATP on the benefits of thistechnology. Medical Benefits to Patients Application. The Aastrom CPS will be used to culture and grow bone marrow cells to be used for transplant. In the future, the CPSmay be used to grow other cell types, potentially useful in varioustherapies, such as human gene therapy and adjuvant therapy forT-cell-related disorders like AIDS. However, its most immediateapplication that examined for this study is to transplant bone marrow cells. Defender Technology. Aastrom officials told us that the currently preferred method for harvesting stem cells is peripheral bloodprogenitor cell collection (PBPC), which has replaced traditionalbone marrow harvest because it is less costly and painful. Under PBPC, the patient is given drug injections to encourage the mobilization of stem cells from the bone marrow into theperipheral blood over a week or more. The mobilized cells arethen collected by connecting the patient to an apheresis device via We compared the costs and benefits of using the Aastrom CPS to those of using PBPC.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-6intravenous needles or a surgically placed catheter. The patient's or donor's blood cells are collected, and the therapeutic volume ofstem and progenitor cells is separated from it. Then the blood isreturned to the patient. The donor must undergo this procedure for2 to 3 days, for 4 to 6 hours per day. 1 Researchers are trying to reduce the amount of time required for this procedure to a singleprotracted session. Specialized laboratory testing is conducted oneach day of the procedure to determine whether a sufficientquantity of the desired cells has been collected. Differences in Health Outcomes. Using the CPS will be considerably simpler for the donor than using PBPC. In a briefoutpatient procedure, the donor will receive a local anesthetic, anda small aspirate of bone marrow will be taken from the hip. Nodrugs or procedures will be required to prepare the patient for thisprocedure prior to the time of the aspirate. In addition, the CPS method is considerably simpler for the donor than PBPC. Rather than undergoing a series of apheresis sessionspreceded by drug therapy for cell mobilization, the patient willreceive a local anesthetic, and a single aspirate of bone marrowwill be taken from the hip. We did not explicitly model differences in long-term health outcomes between the CPS and PBPC. Aastrom officials indicatedthat if the Aastrom CPS (e.g., the cellsproduced in an Aastrom CPS engraft as quickly as the cellscollected by PBPC), patients' long-term health outcomes will besimilar. However, they did mention two factors that may affect asmall portion of patients using the CPS rather than PBPC: Zreduced probability that cancerous cells will be extracted with the stem cells and reintroduced to the patient and Zelimination of the drugs used to mobilize stem cells under the PBPC procedure. 1JNCI News indicates that the procedure requires two to four sessions of 3 to 5 hours each. Physicians we interviewed indicated that there is a trend toward fewer, longer procedures.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-7The acute illness and injury model probably underestimates the benefits to patients of the Aastrom CPS compared to the PBPCmethod. We were not able to explicitly incorporate the benefits ofeither CPS' potential health effects or its impact on patientconvenience and comfort into our model. Empirical data on thechanges in health risk are not available; furthermore, QALYs are notsensitive enough to quantify the impact of differences in pain ordiscomfort for short periods of time. However, we did explainthese factors to physicians who provided diffusion estimates. Thephysicians confirmed that these factors will probably not havesignificant consequences on the health outcomes of most patients,although they may influence the popularity of the method withphysicians and therefore the diffusion rate. Number of Beneficiaries Patients receiving autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplants in the U.S. are eligible to benefit from this technology. In 1996, thispopulation totaled 12,000 according to the International BoneMarrow Transplant (IBMT) registry (1997). According to Aastrom,this number will grow as high-dose chemotherapy and radiationtherapy become more popular treatments for the relevant forms ofcancer. If we use the current rate of increase as cited by the IBMT(1997) registry, this number will increase to 16,000 by the year2000 and to 25,000 by the year 2009. Table 3-3 shows the expected total number of eligible patients from 2000 to 2009. It also shows the results of our analysis of theexpected market penetration of the Aastrom CPS. We need themarket penetration estimation methodology described inSection 2.3.2 to calculate the estimates in Table 3-3. Weinterviewed three physicians to obtain input for the diffusionmodel. Appendix A provides their names and affiliations, theclinical profile we used to inform them about the technology, theinterview guide, and the raw data we collected. Using the data we collected from the experts, we estimated the Bass diffusion model according to the procedures described inSection 2.3.2. The Bass model provided the parameter estimatesfor the forecast equation (Eq. [2.7]). We used these parameters toestimate the number of patients who will be treated using the CPSfor each year in the production phase.The acute illness and injury model probablyunderestimates thebenefits to patientsof the Aastrom CPScompared to thePBPC method. Our market penetration model predicts that Aastrom's CPS will be used for 665 patients in its first year. Its market will grow to 17,251 by 2009.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-8Number Using CPS Year Eligible Patients With ATP Without ATP 2000 16,000 665 0 2001 17,000 1,060 665 2002 18,000 1,674 17,251 14,424 Changes in Health Care Costs Publicly available information from Aastrom indicates that the CPS will reduce the resources required to harvest stem cells. Aastromofficials and physicians we interviewed verified that the cost ofPBPC is between $12,000 and $20,000; we used the midpoint,$16,000, in our comparison of the cost of PBPC and the procedureusing CPS. The cost of CPS equipment and consumables willpartially but not completely offset these savings. Aastrom'sestimate of these costs is confidential information. Estimating Private Return on Investment R&D Costs . Aastrom's contribution to the cost of the ATP project was $1,514,000. As explained above, we estimate that in theabsence of ATP funding Aastrom would have spent $2,034,520 onthis project. Commercialization and Production Costs. Aastrom could not provide an estimate of the costs of commercialization or productionof their CPS instruments and consumables. Thus, we used datafrom the biotechnology industry described in Chapter 2 to assumeTable 3-3. Expected Market Penetration ofAastrom's CPSChapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-9that commercialization costs would be 37 percent of total revenue and that production costs would be 42 percent of revenue. Summary Our model assumes that the Aastrom CPS will enter the U.S. market in 2000, following a 6-year commercialization phase and a 2-yearR&D phase. In the absence of ATP funding, Aastrom estimatesproduct introduction would be delayed by 1 year. ATP fundingalso led to an increase in the total R&D spent on the project,increasing the probability of technical success by 9 percent. If it is technically successful, the Aastrom CPS will replace the PBPC method for patients undergoing stem cell harvest andtransplant. This technology will reduce the discomfort associatedwith the procedure, may reduce the probability of reintroducingtumor cells to some patients, and may reduce the risks of some sideeffects. This treatment will also be less expensive than the averagecost of PBPC. Because we were not able to quantify the medicalbenefits of this technology, our analysis of the medical benefitsfocused on the reduction in cost. Based on physician interviews and model forecast, we expect that the Aastrom CPS will be used to treat over 600 patients in its firstyear of production and over 17,000 patients in 2009. Aastrom and its partners in commercialization and production will incur commercialization and production costs, which we assume will be 37 percent and 42 percent of total revenue, respectively. Our analysis probably underestimates the benefits of this application of Aastrom's technology. We were not able quantifythe benefits of the following factors: Zpossible decreases in the probability of reintroducing cancer into some patients, Zthe benefit to the patient of reducing the inconvenience and discomfort of the procedure, and Zthe potential benefits of eliminating mobilization drugs. In addition, we only considered the U.S. population in estimating the number of patients who will benefit from this technology. TheEuropean market will probably lead to greater revenues for Aastromand its partners.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-103.1.2 Structurally New Biopolymers Derived from Alpha-L Amino Acids Integra LifeSciences Corporation received ATP funding to develop a novel synthetic polymer technology to create a cache of newbioabsorbable polymers for use in biomedical implants. Integra willdevelop the resulting new polymers into prototype orthopedicdevices in collaboration with the Hospital for Joint Diseases.Table 3-4 summarizes the assumptions of our analysis of this project. Timeline of R&D Costs and Benefits Our model assumes the relevant time horizon for this project is 1994 to 2009. Integra LifeSciences begins its 3-year ATP project in1994; the R&D phase is 1994 through 1996. Integra expects that itsbioabsorbable fracture fixation materials will enter the market in2000. Thus, the commercialization phase begins in 1997 and endsin 1999. The production phase lasts 10 years, beginning in 2000and ending in 2009. Integra estimates that ATP funding accelerated the project by at least 10 years. In our model, the R&D phase in the without-ATPscenario lasts 13, rather than 3, years. The commercializationphase begins in 2007. In the absence of ATP funding, theproduction phase would not have begun until after the marketwindow had closed. Thus, we assume that without ATP thisproduct would never enter the production phase. Impact of ATP on Social Returns ATP awarded Integra $1,999,000 in matching funds. Aside from the 10-year acceleration effect discussed above, ATP funding alsoaffected the expected probability of technical success for thisproject. Our conversations with Integra officials indicated that ATPfunding was crucial to the success of this project. Although Integrawould have pursued the technology even in the absence of ATPfunds, they would have funded the project at a much lower annualrate. Other projects would have taken prominence. Thus, weassume that their marginal benefits function was relatively elastic,with an elasticity of -2. Using this elasticity and Eq. (2.2), weestimate that in the absence of ATP funding total spending in theR&D phase would have totaled $89,124 rather than $2,468,000, ATP funding accelerated this project by 10 years, increased the probability of technical success by 171 percent, and expanded the scope of the project.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-11Table 3-4.

Private Company Costs and Benefits Private spending in R&D phase $469,000 with ATP; $89,124 without ATP Commercialization cost 37 percent of revenueProduction cost 42 percent of revenueA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-12which was spent in the with-ATP scenario. Applying this change in spending to Eq. (2.3), we estimate a 171 percent increase in theprobability of technical success in the with-ATP scenario over thewithout-ATP scenario. Integra reported that ATP funding also affected the scope of the project. The funding allowed Integra to attract talented scientistswho will explore the technology's applications in a number of areasother than fracture fixation, including additional orthopedicapplications such as dental and maxillofacial fixation devices andweight-bearing plates, screws, and rods. These applications wouldopen the technology to a greater number of orthopedic patients. Although we did not quantify the impact of ATP on the project's scope, this had no impact on our results. In the without-ATPscenario, production is delayed by 10 years; thus, the modelattributes 100 percent of the net benefits of this project to ATPfunding. The scope effects do not create any additional differencesbetween the with-ATP and the without-ATP scenarios. Medical Benefits to Patients Application. This platform technology has broad applications in orthopedics (fracture fixation, cartilage and ligament repair); woundcare; cardiovascular repair; and drug delivery. However, in thenear term, Integra is focusing on the orthopedic fracture fixationmarket to demonstrate the material's properties and generaterevenue. The first fracture fixation applications\u2014those examinedfor this study\u2014will be nonweight-bearing pins and screws to repairfractures of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, knee, and ankle. Defender Technology. Because current bioabsorbable fixation devices have not achieved widespread acceptance to date, thedefender technology remains metal fixation devices such as pins,rods, plates, and screws. These devices are surgically placed afterreduction of the fracture to maintain alignment and provide stabilityfor the fracture segments. A small proportion of these devices(10 percent at Integra's estimate) are later removed at a secondsurgery after complete healing. 2 Removal is most common in the ankle area where the threat of abrasion is highest because of the 2Our interviews with physicians indicate that the removal rate is much higher in children. Our model analyzes the adult and pediatric markets separately.Integra representatives stress that the early applications of this technology are only a small fraction of the potential uses of this product.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-13limited soft tissue coverage in this region. Stress shielding is also a significant concern and motivator for removal. Regions that aremore difficult to access surgically are least likely for secondarydevice removal. Depending on fracture location, metal fixationdevices can also have an adverse effect on the growth and maturityof bones in children; thus, the use of bioabsorbable devices mayhave special merit in children. Differences in Health Outcomes. We were not able to model any differences in health outcomes between Integra's technology andthe defender technology. Although Integra believes their newmaterial will improve fracture healing compared to metal fracturefixation devices, there are currently no human clinical trial data toquantify these impacts. One recent study compared metal fixationdevices to currently available bioabsorbable devices using severalrandomized trials (B\u00f6stman, 1996). This study found no significantdifference between the ultimate results of treating these fractureswith currently available (not Integra's) bioabsorbable fixationdevices and metallic fixation devices. However, these results arenot directly relevant to Integra's product, because Integra's materialis different than the material used in currently availablebioabsorbable devices. Integra has developed data indicating that compared to currently available bioabsorbable fixation devices the Integra devices reducethe infection rate. However, these data are not relevant to ourmodel because we are comparing the Integra devices to metallicdevices. We were able to quantify what will probably be the most important impact of this material in this application: the economic benefits ofeliminating removal surgery. This surgery is often performed whenmetal pins and screws are used, especially when the patient is achild. As explained below, we used the acute illness and injurymodel to quantify differences in the health care costs of treating afracture using conventional metal fixation devices and Integra'sfixation devices, including the elimination of the second surgery.While some risk and discomfort to the patient are probablyassociated with the second surgery, we were not able to capturethese effects.Although Integra believes their to quantifythese impacts.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-14Number of Beneficiaries We divided the patient population into two groups adults and childrenbecause the impact of Integra's fracture fixation devices will be different for these two groups. Because removal surgery ismore common in children, elimination of this surgery will affectthese populations differently. Thus, it was important to model themarket penetration of Integra's technology separately for childrenand adults. Table 3-5 shows the expected number of adult and child patients who incur the type of injuries we are considering in this model.Table 3-6 shows the total number of eligible patients and theexpected number of patients to be treated with the Integra productin the with-ATP and without-ATP scenarios. We developed theseestimates of market penetration using the methodology explained inSection 2.3.2. We interviewed three physicians to obtain input forthe diffusion model. Using these data, we estimated the Bassdiffusion model and used the forecast equation (Eq. [2.7]) todetermine the expected number of patients treated with the Integramaterials for each year in the production phase for eachpopulation. Changes in Health Care Costs Table 3-7 lists the costs of procedures and materials relevant to our analysis of the impact of Integra's technology on health care costs.We obtained data regarding the hospital charges for most of theprocedures of interest from the HCUP-3 Nationwide InpatientSample for 1992 Hospital Inpatient Stays (AHCPR, 1996). Weinflated these charges to 1996 prices using the CPI index formedical care from the Statistical Abstract and used the standardhospital cost-to-charge ratio of 0.5 to determine costs. To estimatethe charges for some removal surgeries we used the ratio ofremoval surgery costs to initial surgery costs for each proceduregiven in B\u00f6stman (1996). To calculate the average per-patient change in cost, we considered the difference in the removal rates for the two therapies. Accordingto the physicians we interviewed, metal fixation devices requireremoval surgery in 90 percent of the procedures performed onChapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-15Number of Patients Injury Type Adulta,bChilda,b Annual Change Shoulder or elbow 1,350 825 None Wrist and hand 18,000 9,300 None Knee 11,700 9,000 NoneAnkle 9,000 14,800 NoneTotal 40,050 33,825 None aCompany and bNational Hospital Discharge Survey (1994) Number Using Integra Product Year Eligible Patients With ATP Without ATP 2000 Cost Source Surgery to insert metal pins and screws Shoulder or elbow $3,738 AHCPR (1996) $4,990 AHCPR (1996) Surgery pins and screws Shoulder or elbow $852 3-7. Costs of Materials and Proceduresfor Fracture FixationA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-16children and 10 percent of the procedures performed on adults. Based on conversations with physicians, we estimate that theremoval rate for both children and adults may be about 1 percentusing Integra's bioabsorbable devices. Thus, to calculate theaverage cost of treatment using the new and old technologies, wetook a weighted average of the total procedure cost, includingmaterials, and, when required, removal surgery. The averagereduction in per-patient costs is $691. Estimating Private Return on Investment R&D Costs . Integra's contribution to the cost of the ATP project was $469,000. As explained above, we estimate that in theabsence of ATP funding Integra would have spent $89,124 on thisproject. Commercialization and Production Costs. Integra could not provide an estimate of the costs of commercialization or productionof their fracture fixation products. Thus, we used data from thebiotechnology industry described in Chapter 2 to assume thatcommercialization costs would be 37 percent of total revenue andthat production costs would be 42 percent of revenue. Summary Our model assumes that Integra's bioabsorbable fracture fixation products will enter the U.S. market in 2000, following a 3-yearcommercialization phase and a 3-year R&D phase. In the absenceof ATP funding, Integra estimates that the R&D phase would havebeen extended by at least 10 years. ATP funding also led to anincrease in the total R&D spent on the project, increasing theprobability of technical success by 171 percent. Assuming technical success, Integra's materials will replace metal pins and screws for fracture fixation in patients with fractures to theshoulder, elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle. Using these bioabsorbableimplants will eliminate the surgery that is required in many cases toremove metal pins and screws. Although this technology may alsohave significant effects on healing of these fractures, we were notable to quantify these effects. Based on physician interviews and the diffusion model forecast, we expect that these materials will be used to treat over 8,000 patientsChapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-17in the first year of production and almost 35,000 patients in 2009. The average per-patient cost of treating these fractures will fall by$691 (in 1996 dollars). Integra will receive revenue from sales of its bioabsorbable fracture fixation products. Its costs include the R&D costs associated withthe ATP project and commercialization and production costs,which we assume will be 37 percent and 42 percent of totalrevenue, respectively. The main limitation of this model is that it considers only the very first application of Integra's technology. Integra expects that otherorthopedic applications, including additional orthopedicapplications, wound care, cardiovascular repair, and drug delivery,will follow soon after this initial application. The second limitation of this model is its failure to account for any differences in health outcomes between Integra's bioabsorbablefixation devices and metal fixation devices. Although no datacurrently support the estimation of these benefits, these data maybecome available as Integra proceeds with its animal models andhuman trials. At that time, it would be helpful to add health effectsto this model. 3.1.3 Disease Treatment Using Living Implantable Microreactors BioHybrid Technologies, Inc., is developing the capability to implant specific cells into the human body that produce hormonesor other bioactive agents that the patient cannot produce or is notproducing in sufficient quantity. BioHybrid's approach is to encasethe transplanted cells in microspheres to isolate them from theimmune system. These \"microreactors\" have pores large enough topermit glucose; nutrients; electrolytes; oxygen; and relatively smallbioactive species, like insulin, to pass but are small enough toblock the larger immunocytes and other relatively large moleculesinvolved in transplant rejection. Isolating the implanted cells fromthe immune system opens up the possibility of using cells fromsources other than the recipient, for treatment of diseases such asdiabetes. Table 3-8 summarizes the assumptions of our analysis ofthe project.This model is limited by its failure to consider otherapplications of thistechnology and itsfailure to accountfor health effects.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-18Table 3-8.

BioHybrid's 3-year ATP project begins in 1994; the R&Dphase is 1994 through 1997. (BioHybrid has recently beenapproved for a 2-year no cost project extension.) BioHybridexpects that its product will enter the U.S. market in 2000. Thus,the commercialization phase begins in 1997 and ends in 1999.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-19The production phase lasts 10 years, beginning in 2000 and ending in 2009. BioHybrid estimates that ATP funding accelerated the project by 2 years. In our model, the R&D phase in the without-ATP scenariolasts 4, rather than 2, years; the commercialization phase begins in1999 and the production phase begins in 2002. However, becausethe window of market opportunity ends in 2009, the productionphase in the without-ATP scenario is only 8 years. Impact of ATP on Social Returns ATP awarded BioHybrid $4,263,000 in matching funds. Aside from the 2 years of project acceleration discussed above, ATPfunding also increased the expected probability of technicalsuccess for this project. We discussed the impacts of ATP fundingwith BioHybrid officials who indicated that although ATP fundingwas important to securing private funding on the project BioHybridwould have proceeded with the project even in the absence of ATPfunding. Thus, we assume that the marginal benefits function wasrelatively inelastic, with an elasticity of -0.5. Using this elasticityand Eq. (2.2), we estimate that in the absence of ATP funding totalspending in the R&D phase would have totaled $6,027,730, ratherthan $8,525,000, which was spent in the with-ATP scenario.Applying this change in spending to Eq. (2.3), we estimate an11 percent increase in the probability of technical success in thewith-ATP scenario compared to the without-ATP scenario. BioHybrid reported no impact on the scope of the project; however, they did indicate that the ATP funding helped attract theprivate-sector funding for the ATP match and the additional fundingthat will be required to bring the product to market. This \"haloeffect\" of ATP funding may have affected BioHybrid's cost ofcapital, their total R&D spending, and their probability of technicalsuccess. We did not explicitly quantify this effect; thus, we haveprobably underestimated the impact of ATP on the benefits of thistechnology. Medical Benefits to Patients Application. BioHybrid's technology has the potential to be applied to a number of therapeutic applications, including ATP funding helped BioHybrid attract the private-sectorfunding needed forthe ATP match andthe additionalfunding needed tobring the product tomarket.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-20hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatic failure. However, the most immediate application the one considered for this study is for diabetic patients who are unable to produce insulin to control blood glucose. Defender Technology. This technology would be used in place of multiple daily insulin injections. Differences in Health Outcomes. To receive the BioHybrid implants, patients will undergo an outpatient procedure under localanesthetic. Encapsulated islet cells will be injected into theperitoneal cavity under ultrasound control. Because thetransplanted islet cells have a finite life, the patient will receive aninjection once or twice a year. The dose and frequency oftreatment have not yet been finalized but will be determined duringthe planned clinical trials. If successful, the transplants will allow patients to achieve close to normal glycemic control, virtually eliminating many of the risks oflong-term complications of diabetes, including retinopathy,nephropathy, and renal disease. To quantify the impact of thesehealth impacts, we used the chronic disease model described inChapter 2. We found much of the data required for the model inthe results of a carefully controlled study of intensive insulintherapy on the long-term health outcomes of diabetic patients, theDiabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT). This studydemonstrated that intensive insulin therapy would control (DCCTRG, 1993; DCCTRG, 1995; DCCTRG,1996). BioHybrid believes that the control provided by itstechnology will be at least as effective as intense insulin therapy.Thus, if BioHybrid is technically successful, our estimates of thelong-term health impacts of its technology are conservative. Health States. Our model includes three diseases\u2014retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy\u2014which are the primary healthcomplications of diabetes. For each of these diseases, a series ofhealth states describes the seriousness of the disease. The DCCTdefined these health states (DCCTRG, 1993). They are listed inTable 3-9. Each of the health states is associated with a QALY and a cost. The cost includes the personnel, drug, equipment, and establishmentBioHybrid's technology will replace daily insulin injections in diabetic patients. We examined the technology's impact on the three primary complications of diabetes: retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering 1995, 1996). cost of treating these disease states. The cost and QALY estimates listed in Table 3-9 were based on those reported by the DCCT study(DCCTRG, 1993; DCCTRG, 1995; DCCTRG, 1996). Note that noestimates are provided for intermediate health states. Transition Probabilities. The transition probabilities indicate the probability of moving from one health state in one year to anotherhealth state in the next year. We developed the transitionprobabilities for nephropathy, neuropathy, for the three models arefound in Table 3-10. Switching Probabilities. At the end of each year, part of the patient cohort will be switched from the defender technology to the newtechnology. The market diffusion forecast provides these switchingprobabilities.Table 3-9.

Ourmodel follows the progression of this cohort of diabetics from thetime the new technology is introduced (2000) through the end oftheir lives. Table 3-11.

Table 3-11 also shows the results of our analysis of the expected market penetration of BioHybrid's encapsulation technology. Wedeveloped these estimates of market penetration using themethodology explained in Section 2.3.2. We interviewed threephysicians to obtain input for the diffusion model. Using these data, we estimated the Bass diffusion model and the forecast equation (Eq. [2.7]) to determine the expected number ofpatients receiving BioHybrid's technology for each year in theproduction phase.Although there are many undiagnosed diabetics in the U.S., we do not include them in our patient cohort because they will not be treated.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-25Changes in Health Care Costs Each of the health states in the model is associated with an annual cost. The difference between the cost of treating a patient usingdaily insulin injections and BioHybrid's technology depends onboth the cost of treatment (daily insulin injections or BioHybridimplants) and the cost of treating the complications of diabetes,which are defined by the health states shown in Table 3-9. Asnoted earlier, the cost estimates listed in Table 3-9 are based onthose reported by the DCCT study (DCCTRG, 1993; DCCTRG,1995; DCCTRG, 1996). The per-patient lifetime increase in healthcare costs is $42,996. Estimating Private Return on Investment R&D Costs. BioHybrid's contribution to the cost of the ATP project was $4,262,000. As explained above, we estimate that in theabsence of ATP funding BioHybrid would have spent $6,027,730on this project. Commercialization and Production Costs. BioHybrid could not provide an estimate of the costs of commercialization orproduction. Thus, we used data from the biotechnology industrydescribed in Chapter 2 to assume that commercialization costswould be 37 percent of total revenue and that production costswould be 42 percent of revenue. Summary Our model examines the costs and benefits of the development of BioHybrid's diabetes treatment technology from 1994 to 2009. Inthe with-ATP scenario, the R&D phase lasts 3 years, thecommercialization phase lasts 3 years, and the production phaselasts 10 years. In the without-ATP scenario, the R&D phase lasts5 years, and the production phase lasts only 8 years. ATP funding accelerated the R&D phase of the project by 2 years, increased the level of total R&D spending by about $2.5 millionand increased the probability of technical success by 11 percent. BioHybrid's technology will be used in the treatment of diabetes in lieu of daily insulin injections. The treatment, if technicallysuccessful, will provide glycemic control at least as effective as thatstudied in the DCCT. Thus, we used data from that study to modelthe health impacts of this technology.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-26Based on the predictions of the experts we interviewed and our market diffusion model, we expect that in its first year ofproduction, this technology will be used to treat over 65,000patients; by 2009, it will be used to treat over one million diabeticsannually. Although the costs of treating diabetes will rise, the costsof treating its complications will fall as the complications arereduced by the treatment. In the with-ATP scenario, BioHybrid invests $4,262,000 in R&D for this project; our model predicts that without the ATP grant theywould have invested over $6 million. Our model assumes thatBioHybrid and its partners in commercialization and productionwill spend about 37 percent and 42 percent of revenue oncommercialization and production, respectively. This model does not take into account the following factors: Zpatients diagnosed after 2000 whom we did not include in the fixed patient cohort; Zthe change in quality of life for the patient from eliminating insulin injections; Zthe improved health outcomes that may occur over and above what was found in the DCCT; and Zother health effects associated with diabetes that were not modeled by the DCCT, such as cardiovascular effects. In addition, we could not find estimates of QALYs or costs for the intermediate health states of diabetes (see Table 3-9). The DCCTonly estimates costs and QALYs for the end-stage diseases.Because these end-stage conditions occur late in life, most of thebenefits of the diabetes model occur late in a patient's life.Consequently, the benefits are sensitive to the discount rate,especially because costs occur in each year, while benefits occurlate in life. 3.1.4 Treatment of Diabetes by Proliferated Human Islets in Photocrosslinkable Alginate Capsules VivoRx, Inc., is developing a new treatment for diabetes that will consist of transplanting human islets that have been encapsulated inimmunoprotective membrane consisting of a novel material. Thismaterial protects the cells from the host's immune response. Thistechnology has potential applications for liver disease, thyroidChapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-27disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the most immediate application that examined for this study is for the treatment of diabetes. It will eliminate the need for dailyinsulin injections and will enable patients to achieve tight glycemiccontrol, reducing the risk of the common complications of diabetes. The objective of VivoRx's ATP project is to make this therapy widely available by producing a source of human islet cells.VivoRx is developing the culture conditions and methods forproliferating human islets. They are simultaneously perfecting thepolymers and biomaterials that are required to achieveimmunoprotection and biocompatibility for the encapsulationtechnology. Table 3-12 summarizes the assumptions of ouranalysis of the project. Timeline of R&D Costs and Benefits In our model, the relevant time horizon for this project is 1995 to 2008. VivoRx's 3-year ATP project begins in 1995; the R&D phaseof this project is 1995 through 1997. VivoRx expects that itsproduct will enter the market in 1999. Thus, thecommercialization phase occurs in 1998. The production phaselasts 10 years, beginning in 1999 and ending in 2008. VivoRx estimates that ATP funding accelerated the project by 3 to 5 years. Using the median of this range (4 years), the R&D phase inthe without-ATP scenario lasts 7, rather than 3, years. Thecommercialization phase occurs in 2002 and the production phasebegins in 2003. The window of market opportunity is fixed; theproduction period in the without-ATP scenario lasts only 6 years. Impact of ATP on Social Returns ATP awarded VivoRx $2,000,000 in matching funds. Aside from the acceleration effect discussed above, we modeled how ATP fundingaffected the expected probability of technical success for this project.We asked VivoRx officials about how they would have proceeded inthe absence of ATP funding. They indicated that although ATPfunding was important to securing private funding on the projectVivoRx would have proceeded with the project even in the absenceVivoRx has tested the effectiveness of its diabetes treatment using islet cells from human cadaver pancreata. The success of these tests has encouraged VivoRx to take the next step in making this treatment widely available: providing proliferated human islets for transplant. The relevant time horizon for this project is 1995 to2008.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-28Table 3-12. Model Assumptions for \"Treatment of Diabetes by Proliferated Human Islets in Photocrosslinkable Alginate Capsules\" Timeline of Costs and Benefits With ATP Without ATP Year 1 of R&D phase 1995 1995 Year 1 of commercialization phase 1998 2002Year 1 of production phase 1999 2003Final year of market window 2008 2008 Impact of ATP ATP matching funds $2,000,000 Acceleration 4 yearsProbability of success Elasticity of marginal benefits curve -0.5Total project R&D $16,925,000 with ATP; $15,893,570 without ATPProbability of success 2 percent higher in the with-ATP scenario Scope effects None reported Medical Benefits Per Patient Application Diabetes Defender technology Daily insulin injectionsPatient population All Type I diabetics; insulin-dependent Type II diabetics Differences in health outcomes As noted in the DCCT study (DCCTRG, 1996), about 0.6 QALY per patient over their lifetime Number of Beneficiaries 63,711 in 1999; 1,007,470 by 2008 Changes in Health Care Costs Annual procedure costs increase but costs of treating health effects of diabetes fall Private Company Costs and Benefits Private spending in R&D phase $14,925,000 with ATP; $15,893,570 without ATP Commercialization cost 37 percent of revenueProduction cost 42 percent of revenue of ATP funding. Thus, we assume that the marginal benefits function was relatively inelastic, with an elasticity of -0.5. Using thiselasticity and Eq. (2.2), we estimate that in the absence of ATPfunding total spending in the R&D phase would have totaled$15,893,570, rather than $16,925,000, which was spent in the with-ATP scenario. Applying this change in spending to Eq. (2.3), weChapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-29estimate a 2 percent increase in the probability of technical success in the with-ATP scenario compared to the without-ATP scenario. Medical Benefits to Patients Application. Although the proliferation of human islet cells will lead to advances in the treatment of many diseases, the mostimmediate application that considered for this study is to replace daily insulin injections in diabetic patients. Defender Technology. This technology would be used in place of multiple daily insulin injections. Differences in Health Outcomes. The application will involve an outpatient procedure and a local anesthetic. Proliferated,encapsulated human islet cells are injected into the peritonealcavity. The procedure will be repeated once per year or perhapsonce every 2 years to replenish the cells. The dose and frequencyof treatment have not yet been finalized but will be determinedduring the current Phase I/Phase II trials. If successful, the procedure will allow patients to achieve close to normal glycemic control, virtually eliminating many of the risks oflong-term complications of diabetes, including retinopathy,nephropathy, and renal disease. Because the expected long-termhealth effects and the patient population are the same as forBioHybrid's technology, we used the same model and data toquantify the health impacts of this technology. VivoRx officialsnoted that it is appropriate to use the long-term health impactsreported in the DCCT to analyze the benefits of VivoRx'stechnology. Thus, the health states, the QALYs and costsassociated with them, and the transition probabilities required forthe model are the same as those used for the BioHybrid project.We derived the switching probabilities for each year from themarket penetration analysis discussed below. Number of Beneficiaries The relevant patient population is Type I and insulin-dependent Type II diabetics. As shown in Table 3-13, there will beapproximately 1,955,000 diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetics inthe U.S. in 1999. Our model follows the progression of this cohortof diabetics from 1999 through the end of their lives.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-30Table 3-13 shows the expected total number of patients eligible to receive this treatment from 1999 to 2008. It also shows the resultsof our analysis of the expected market penetration of the VivoRxdiabetes treatment. We developed these estimates of marketpenetration using the methodology explained in Section 2.3.2. Weinterviewed three physicians to obtain input for the diffusionmodel. Using these data, we estimated the Bass diffusion modeland the forecast equation (Eq. [2.7]) to determine the expectednumber of patients receiving VivoRx's technology for each year inthe production period. Table 3-13. Expected Market Penetration for the VivoRx Diabetes Treatment Technology Number Using VivoRx Technology Year Eligible Patients With ATP Without ATP 1999 1,955,000 63,711 0 Health Care Costs Each of the health states is associated with an annual cost. The difference between the cost of treating a patient using daily insulininjections and VivoRx's technology depends on both the cost oftreatment (daily insulin injections or VivoRx implants) and the costof treating the complications of diabetes, which are defined by thehealth states shown in Table 3-9. The cost estimates listed inTable 3-9 are based on those reported by the DCCT studyChapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-31(DCCTRG, 1993; DCCTRG, 1995; DCCTRG, 1996). The per- patient lifetime increase in health care costs is $129,627. Estimating Private Return on Investment R&D Costs. VivoRx's contribution to the cost of the ATP project was $14,925,000. As explained above, we estimate that in the absenceof ATP funding VivoRx's investment costs would have risen to$15,893,570; however, the total R&D funding would have fallen. Commercialization and Production Costs. We used data from the biotechnology industry described in Chapter 2 to assume thatcommercialization costs would be 37 percent of total revenue andthat production costs would be 42 percent of revenue. Summary Our model examines the costs and benefits of developing VivoRx's diabetes treatment technology from 1995 to 2008. In the with-ATPscenario, the R&D phase lasts 3 years, the commercialization phaselasts 1 year, and the production phase lasts 10 years. In thewithout-ATP scenario, the R&D phase lasts 7 years, and theproduction phase lasts only 6 years. ATP funding accelerated the R&D phase of the project by 4 years, increased the level of total R&D spending by over $1 million, andincreased the probability of technical success by 2 percent. VivoRx's technology will be used in the treatment of diabetes in lieu of daily insulin injections. The treatment, if technicallysuccessful, will provide glycemic control at least as effective as thatstudied in the DCCT. Thus, we used data from that study to modelthe health impacts of this technology. Based on the predictions of the experts we interviewed and our market diffusion model, we expect that in its first year ofproduction, this technology will be used to treat over 63,000patients. By 2008, it will be used to treat over one million diabeticsannually. Although the costs of treating diabetes will rise, the costsof treating its complications will fall as the complications arereduced by the treatment. In the with-ATP scenario, VivoRx invests $14,925,000 in R&D; our model predicts that without the ATP grant they would have investedA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-32almost $16 million. Our model assumes that VivoRx and its partners in commercialization and production will spend about37 percent and 42 percent of revenue on commercialization andproduction, respectively. Because we used the same health benefits model for VivoRx's technology as we did for BioHybrid's, our estimates suffer from thesame limitations, including the failure to consider Zpatients diagnosed after 1999 whom we did not include in the fixed patient cohort; Zthe change in quality of the patient's life from eliminating insulin injections; Zthe improved health outcomes that may occur over and above what was found in the DCCT; Zother health effects associated with diabetes, such as cardiovascular effects; and ZZZZthe differences in cost on health effects of intermediate stages of each disease. In addition, we did not consider the potential interaction between the VivoRx technology and the BioHybrid technology. Instead, weanalyzed each technology in the absence of the other. If bothtechnologies are technically successful, they may compete formarket share. It is difficult to forecast how this competition mightaffect private and social returns. 3.1.5 Fabrication of Clinical Prosthesis from Biomaterials The objective of Tissue Engineering's ATP project was to further the development of its new class of biomaterials. These biomaterialscan be developed into prostheses that provide templates thatmobilize the body's own cells and induce them to rebuild losttissue, gradually replacing the prosthesis itself. With ATP funding,Tissue Engineering furthered the development of its basic ADMAT,or animal derived extracellular matrix. It can produce ADMAT in avariety of forms, has characterized the necessary properties of theADMAT substrate to promote cell growth and differentiation, hascharacterized ADMAT for immunogenicity, and has developed cellbanks to support five types of proposed cell-incorporatingprostheses. Table 3-14 summarizes the assumptions of our analysisof the project.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-33Table 3-14. Model Assumptions for \"Fabrication of Clinical Prostheses from Biomaterials\" Timeline of Costs and Benefits With ATP Without ATP Year 1 of R&D phase 1993 1993 Year 1 of commercialization phase 1996 1998Year 1 of production phase 2001 2003Final year of market window 2010 2010 Impact of ATP ATP matching funds $1,999,000 Acceleration 2 yearsProbability of success Elasticity of marginal benefits curve -0.01Total Project R&D $4,127,000 with ATP; $4,099,750 without ATPProbability of success 1 percent higher in the with-ATP scenario Scope effects None reported Medical Benefits Per Patient Application Repair of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) Defender technology Allogeneic banked tissue or autologous graft from patella tendon Patient population Patients undergoing surgery for ACL repairDifferences in health outcomes (Not quantified)May reduce failure rates associated with both allogeneic banked tissue and autologous graft, riskof contamination associated with allogeneic tissue,and reduce morbidity compared to autologous graft Number of Beneficiaries 9,000 in 2001; 71,773 by 2010 (See Table 3-15) Changes in Health Care Costs None Private Company Costs and Benefits Private spending in R&D phase $2,128,000 with ATP; $4,099,750 without ATP Commercialization cost 37 percent of revenueProduction cost 42 percent of revenue Timeline of R&D Costs and Benefits Our model traces the benefits and costs of Tissue Engineering's ATP project from 1993 to 2010. The ATP project begins in 1993; theR&D phase of this project is 1993 to 1995. Tissue Engineeringexpects that its product will enter the U.S. market in 2001. Thus,the commercialization phase begins in 1996 and ends in 2000.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-34The production phase lasts 10 years, beginning in 2001 and ending in 2010. Tissue Engineering estimates that ATP funding accelerated the project by 2 years. The R&D phase in the without-ATP scenariolasts 5, rather than 3, years. The commercialization phase beginsin 1998 and the production phase begins in 2003. However, thewindow of market opportunity is fixed; the production period is2 years shorter in the without-ATP scenario. Impact of ATP on Social Returns ATP awarded Tissue Engineering $1,999,000 in matching funds. Aside from the acceleration effect discussed above, ATP fundingalso had a very small impact on the probability of technical successfor this project. We asked Tissue Engineering officials about howthey would have proceeded in the absence of ATP funding. Theyindicated that the absence of ATP funding would have made nodifference in their funding decisions. Thus, we assume that theirmarginal benefits function was very inelastic, with an elasticity of-0.01. Using this elasticity and Eq. (2.2), we determined that in theabsence of ATP funding, total spending in the R&D phase wouldhave totaled $4,099,750, rather than $4,127,000, which was spentin the with-ATP scenario. This results in a 1 percent increase in theprobability of technical success in the with-ATP scenario comparedto the without-ATP scenario. Tissue Engineering reported no impact on the scope of the project; however, they did indicate that the ATP funding was important forpeer recognition of their work. Medical Benefits to Patients Application. ADMAT can be used to enhance collagen scaffolds for vascular grafts, ligaments, tendons, periodontal tissue, andsimilar reconstructions. ADMAT alone can be used as a matrix onwhich \"glandular\" cells such as insulin-producing cells, nerve cellprecursors, thyroid cells, and others can grow and function. At thetime of our survey, a likely early commercial application wasthought to be reconstruction of ligaments, tendons, and articularcartilage. A specific sub-class of those therapies is the application ADMAT can be used for vascular grafts, ligament and tendon repair, and periodontal and similar reconstruction.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-35of ADMAT to repair the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which is the application modeled for this project. Defender Technology. Two technologies are currently in use for surgical repair of the ACL: graft from cadaver tissue and autologousgraft from the patient's patella tendon or hamstring. Many patientsdo not undergo surgical repair. Differences in Health Outcomes. ACL repair currently suffers from a number of problems. Cadaver tissue is limited and carries a riskof viral infection. Autologous grafts often cause graft site morbidity,which may limit the patient's use of the area from which the graftwas taken. We spoke with several doctors who specialize in ACL repair and reviewed many papers on ACL repair procedures. These sourcesindicated that eliminating the risk of viral infection and graft sitemorbidity in patients undergoing ACL repair would certainlyincrease a patient's quality of life. Currently, a QALY instrumentdeveloped by Dr. Nicholas G.H. Mohtadi at the University ofCalgary is being tested to determine the relative quality of life ofpatients before and after ACL surgery (Mohtadi, 1993). Thisresearch, which is being conducted by Dr. Mohtadi and hiscolleague Dr. P.H. Marks at the University of Toronto, will providesignificant insight into the potential health benefits of eliminatingcomplications of ACL repair (Marks and Mohtadi, 1996). Until these estimates are available, we have only qualitative data to determine the potential gain from removing the complications ofACL surgery. Based on our conversations with a number ofphysicians, we assume that with the new technology a personwould gain 0.025 QALY points per year (e.g., their QALYs wouldchange from 0.90 to 0.925). For a person who lives 40 years pastthe time of surgery, this translates into 0.58 additional QALYs usinga 3 percent discount rate. Number of Beneficiaries The patient population for Tissue Engineering's technology consists of the patients undergoing surgery for ACL repair. Jack Parr, ofWright Medical, a firm partnering with Tissue Engineering inmarketing this application, estimated this population at 100,000annually.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-36Table 3-15 shows the expected total number of patients eligible to receive this treatment from 2001 to 2010. It also shows the resultsof our analysis of the expected market penetration of the TissueEngineering technology. We developed these estimates of marketpenetration using the methodology explained in Section 2.3.2.Because this was not one of our in-depth case studies, we obtainedinput for the diffusion model from one expert, a representative fromWright Medical. Number Using ADMAT Year Eligible Patients With ATP Without ATP 2000 100,000 9,000 0 2001 100,000 19,493 0 2002 100,000 30,293 71,773 67,102 Using these data, we estimated the Bass diffusion model and the forecast equation (Eq. [2.7]) to determine the expected number ofpatients receiving Tissue Engineering's technology for each year inthe production period. Changes in Health Care Costs We assume that the cost of repairing an ACL with the material provided by Tissue Engineering would be the same as currentmethods. Although the new technology requires the purchase ofthe ADMAT material developed by Tissue Engineering, other costsassociated with the defender technology, such as obtaining thegraft material from a cadaver or from another site on the patient,will be eliminated. According to a representative of WrightTable 3-15. Expected Market Penetration forthe Tissue Engineering'sADMAT Material forRepairing the ACL The additional cost of the ADMAT material will be outweighed by the savings resulting from eliminating the costs of obtaining the graft from a cadaver or from the patient's patella tendon.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-37Medical, these savings will at least outweigh the cost of the ADMAT material. Thus, there are no changes in health care costsin this model. Estimating Private Return on Investment R&D Costs. Tissue Engineering's contribution to the cost of the ATP project was $2,128,000. As explained above, we estimate thatin the absence of ATP funding Tissue Engineering would have spent$4,099,750 on this project. Commercialization and Production Costs. Tissue Engineering could not provide an estimate of the costs of commercialization orproduction of the ADMAT material for use in repairing the ACL.Thus, we used data from the biotechnology industry described inChapter 2 to assume that commercialization costs would be37 percent of total revenue and that production costs would be42 percent of revenue. Summary We evaluated the benefits and costs of Tissue Engineering's ATP project from 1993 to 2010. In the with-ATP scenario, the R&Dphase lasts 3 years, the commercialization phase lasts 5 years, andthe production phase lasts 10 years. In the without-ATP scenario,the R&D phase is 2 years longer and the production phase is 2years shorter. Tissue Engineering stated that ATP funding accelerated the project by 2 years but had little impact on the level of funding or the scopeof the project. Based on these qualitative remarks, our modelestimated a 1 percent increase in the probability of technicalsuccess due to ATP funding. If technically successful, Tissue Engineering's ADMAT material will replace allogeneic and autologous grafts for patients undergoingsurgery for ACL repair. The reduction in failure rates, reduced riskof contamination, and reduced morbidity will increase the qualityof life for these patients. The cost of treating these patients will notsubstantially change. Based on the predictions of a company representative and our market penetration model, we expect that ADMAT will be used toA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-38repair the ACL in 9,000 patients in its first year to market, and about 72,000 patients in 2010. Tissue Engineering and its partners in commercialization and production will receive revenue from the sale of ADMAT. TissueEngineering spent 2,128,000 in R&D on the ATP project. In ourmodel, they will incur commercialization and production costs of37 and 42 percent of these revenues, respectively. The primary weakness of this model is the unavailability of clinical data to verify the qualitative estimates of the impact of thistechnology on patients' quality of life. 3.1.6 Application of Gene Therapy to Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases The objective of Progenitor, Inc.'s, ATP project was to develop a supply of transplantable endothelial cells from precursor stem cellsthat can be genetically engineered or otherwise modified forspecific medical purposes. Progenitor originally envisioned thatone application target would use these cells to repair damagedvascular tissue, with the most immediate application being thetreatment of damage associated with coronary angioplasty. Otherpotential medical application areas originally identified byProgenitor were cancer treatments and bone development. In the course of its research, Progenitor made an important discovery that provided an opportunity to strengthen the goals andactivities related to cancer treatments. Progenitor believes thateventually this discovery will lead to a new treatment for solidtumor cancers. However, its most immediate application is thediagnosis, location, and staging of soft tissue metastases. Theresulting improvement in diagnostic techniques will allow for moreaggressive, effective cancer therapy at an earlier stage of metastasis,improving patients' prognosis. Table 3-16 summarizes theassumptions of this analysis of the project. Timeline of R&D Costs and Benefits We modeled the benefits and costs of Progenitor's ATP project from 1995 to 2011. The 3-year ATP project begins in 1995; the R&Dphase is 1995 to 1997. Progenitor expects that its product willenter the U.S. market in 2002. Thus, the commercializationChapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-39Table 3-16.

The production phase lasts 10 years, beginning in 2002 and ending in 2011. Progenitorestimates that ATP funding accelerated the project by 2 years. TheR&D phase in the without-ATP scenario lasts 5, rather than 3, years.The commercialization phase begins in 2000 and the productionphase begins in 2004. However, the window of market opportunityis fixed; the production period is 2 years shorter in the without-ATPscenario. Impact of ATP on Social Returns ATP awarded Progenitor $1,996,000 in matching funds. Aside from the acceleration effect discussed above, ATP funding also had animportant impact on the probability of technical success for thisproject. Progenitor indicated that in the absence of ATP fundingthey would have proceeded with the project, although it wouldhave had a lower priority, resulting in lower annual funding and thedelay mentioned earlier. Thus, we assume that their marginalbenefits function was relatively inelastic, with an elasticity of -0.5.Using this elasticity and Eq. (2.2), we determined that in theabsence of ATP funding total spending in the R&D phase wouldhave totaled $1,494,390, rather than $2,795,000, which was spentin the with-ATP scenario. This results in a 20 percent increase inthe probability of technical success in the with-ATP scenariocompared to the without-ATP scenario. Progenitor stated that the ATP funding allowed them to explore endothelial cells in greater depth than they might have otherwisebeen able to. However, they were not able to state specificallyhow this affected the scope of the project. Thus, we were not ableto model these scope effects in terms of changes in the applicationsor patient populations. Medical Benefits to Patients Application. Progenitor believes that eventually this technology will lead to a new treatment for solid tumor cancers. However, its mostimmediate application is the diagnosis, location, and staging of softtissue metastases. The resulting improvement in diagnostictechniques will allow for more aggressive, effective cancer therapyat an earlier stage of metastasis, improving patients' prognosis. Wechose to illustrate the potential benefits of Progenitor's product byATP funding accelerated the project by 2 years, increased total R&D spending by about $1.3 million, and increased the probability of technical success by 20 percent.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-41showing its impact on the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. The technology will be embodied in a diagnostic kit. The kit willbe used to conduct an imaging procedure that will be used inconjunction with technetium bone scans. Defender Technology. Currently no technologies image soft tissue adequately to diagnose metastasis at a very early stage. Thus,Progenitor's product will not replace any current technologies butwill supplement the current diagnostic techniques. Differences in Health Outcomes. Progenitor's technology will improve the detection of metastasis once cancer has beendiagnosed. We used the acute illness and injury model to developa cancer diagnosis model to estimate the value of improveddiagnosis of cancer metastasis. Ideally, we would develop a Markov model for demonstrating the benefits of improved cancer diagnosis. In each year after beingdiagnosed with cancer, a patient has a probability of transitioninginto another health state. The improved diagnosis provided by theProgenitor product would decrease the probability of progressinginto more advanced health states because the correct diagnosiswould lead to more appropriate treatment. Because the Progenitorproject was not one of our in-depth case studies and because timefor collecting data was limited, we opted for a simpler model, asillustrated in Figure 3-1. The patient population includes all lung cancer patients. We allocated this population among localized, regional, and distantmetastasis, using data on the incidence of different stages of cancerat diagnosis. For each stage of cancer, the defender technologyprovides probability, p, that the metastasis will be diagnosedcorrectly, while Progenitor's technology provides improvedprobability of correct diagnosis, p . Metastases that are detected can be treated appropriately; left undetected, these metastases willprogress to a more advanced stage before they are treated, costingthe patient additional life-years. For example, if patients withregional metastasis are diagnosed correctly, we assume their 5-yearsurvival rate is equal to Y 2, the 5-year survival rate for regional metastasis. If they are misdiagnosed, we assume their metastasisprogresses, so we assigned them a 5-year survival rate for distantmetastasis (Stage 3) of Y 3.Progenitor's first application of its discovery will be the diagnosis, location, and staging of soft tissue cancer metastases. The resulting improvement in diagnosis of these metastases will allow more effective cancer therapy.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-42Figure 3-1.

We obtained data regarding the sensitivity of standard metastasis detection techniques(CT scans) from Buccheri and Ferrigno (1995). Progenitor provided an estimate of the expected sensitivity of their product.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-43Number of Beneficiaries The patient population for this application of Progenitor's technology is all lung cancer patients. Table 3-17 shows theexpected total number of patients eligible to receive this procedurefrom 2002 to 2011. It also shows the results of our analysis of theexpected market penetration of Progenitor's product. Number Using Progenitor's Technology Year Eligible Patients With ATP Without ATP 2002 173,500 17,350 0 to provide a 10-year forecast of market penetration; therefore, we did not use the Bassmodel to estimate market penetration for this technology.Appendix A contains the raw data we collected from companyrepresentatives. Changes in Health Care Costs Because Progenitor's technology will not replace a defender technology, but will augment existing diagnostic techniques, thecost of the diagnostic procedure represents an increase in the costof treating a patient with lung cancer. In addition, some of thebenefits derived from extending a patient's life are offset by the costof caring for that person during these additional years. The per-patient increase in lifetime health care costs is about $452. WeTable 3-17. Expected Market Penetration forProgenitor's TumorImaging TechnologyA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-44obtained data on the average annual cost of treating lung cancer patients from Virgo et al. (1996). Estimating Private Return on Investment R&D Costs . Progenitor's contribution to the cost of the ATP project was $799,000. As explained above, we estimate that in theabsence of ATP funding, Progenitor would have invested$1,494,390 on this project. Commercialization and Production Costs. Progenitor could not provide an estimate of the costs of commercialization or productionof its product; it plans to license the technology to anothercompany that will conduct these activities. Thus, we used datafrom the biotechnology industry described in Chapter 2 to assumethat commercialization costs would be 37 percent of total revenueand that production costs would be 42 percent of revenue. Summary We evaluated the costs and benefits of Progenitor's ATP project from 1995 to 2011. In the with-ATP scenario, the R&D phase lasts3 years, the commercialization phase lasts 4 years, and theproduction phase lasts 10 years. In the without-ATP scenario, theR&D phase is 2 years longer while the production phase is 2 yearsshorter. ATP funding accelerated the project by 2 years. Using our model of the impact of the cost of funding on total R&D and theprobability of technical success, we estimate that ATP fundingincreased the total R&D effort by about $1.3 million and theprobability of technical success by 20 percent. Although this technology has a number of applications, the one examined for this case study is the diagnosis, location, and stagingof soft tissue metastases from many kinds of cancer. To illustratethe potential impact of this technology on one patient population,we modeled the health benefits to lung cancer patients. Byimproving the diagnosis of metastasis, this technology will lead tomore aggressive and effective treatment of lung cancer, improvingpatients' survival rate.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-45The procedure will add to the total cost of diagnosis because it will be performed in conjunction with currently used diagnostictechniques. Extending a patient's life also adds to the lifetime costsof their health care. Based on Progenitor's estimates, our model assumes that Progenitor's technology will be used for over 17,000 diagnoses inits first year of production; by 2011, it will be used for over 98,000diagnoses. Progenitor and its partners in commercialization and production will earn revenues from the sale of diagnostic kits that will embodythe Progenitor technology. Aside from R&D expenses, they willalso incur commercialization and production costs, which, in ourmodel, are 37 and 42 percent of revenue, respectively. The accuracy of this model would be improved by using a Markov model and populating it with data regarding the probability oftransitioning from one health state to the next, the cost of treatingpatients in each health state, and the QALYs associated with eachhealth state. In addition, we considered only the sensitivity ofdiagnostic methods (the probability that a positive result is correct).We did not consider the impact of false positive diagnoses. IfProgenitor's new diagnostic technique improves the specificity ofcancer diagnosis, this may also contribute to social benefits to theextent that incorrect positive diagnoses lead to costly unnecessarytreatment and cause patients pain and suffering. Finally, we haveconsidered only one type of cancer; however, if successful, thisproduct will improve diagnosis of soft tissue metastasis for manykinds of cancer. 3.1.7 Universal Donor Organs for Transplantations The objective of Alexion Pharmaceuticals' ATP project is to develop transgenic animals that will provide a source of organs forxenogeneic transplants. In most cases, xenogeneic transplants failbecause of hyperacute rejection (HAR), which causes graft failureswithin minutes to hours. To address this problem, Alexion isdeveloping animals that express key human genes to eliminate theHAR response. Alexion plans to develop organs for humantransplant, called UniGraft organs, from transgenic pigs.Table 3-18 summarizes the assumptions of our analysis of theproject.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-46Table 3-18.

Our analysis considers heart transplants only.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-47Timeline of R&D Costs and Benefits Our model assumes the relevant time horizon for this project is 1995 to 2011. Alexion's 3-year ATP project begins in 1995; theR&D phase is 1995 to 1997. Alexion expects that its product willenter the U.S. market in 2002. Thus, the commercialization phasebegins in 1998 and ends in 2001. The production phase lasts 10years, beginning in 2002 and ending in 2011. Alexion estimates that ATP funding accelerated the project by 1 to 2 years. Using the conservative estimate of 1 year, the R&D phasein the without-ATP scenario lasts 4, rather than 3, years. Thecommercialization phase begins in 1999 and the production phasebegins in 2003. However, the window of market opportunity isfixed; the production period is 1 year shorter in the without-ATPscenario. Impact of ATP on Social Returns ATP awarded Alexion $1,999,000 in matching funds. Aside from the acceleration effect discussed above, ATP funding also had animportant impact on the probability of technical success for thisproject. Alexion representatives indicated that in the absence ofATP funding they would have proceeded with the project, althoughit would have progressed more slowly. Thus, we assume that theirmarginal benefits function was relatively inelastic, with an elasticityof -0.5. Using this elasticity and Eq. (2.2), we determined that inthe absence of ATP funding total spending in the R&D phase wouldhave totaled $1,963,770, rather than $3,203,000, which was spentin the with-ATP scenario. This results in a 16 percent increase inthe probability of technical success in the with-ATP scenariocompared to the without-ATP scenario. Medical Benefits to Patients Application. Although Alexion's technology may enable the xenogeneic transplant of hearts, kidneys, lungs, and islets, wemodeled the medical and economic benefits of transplantedxenogeneic hearts only. This analysis illustrates the potentialbenefits of xenogeneic transplants for other organs. Defender Technology. We assume that Alexion's UniGraft hearts will be used for patients who would otherwise not be able to obtainA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-48a heart transplant because of a shortage of donor organs. Thus, the defender technology is standard heart disease treatment whileawaiting a heart transplant. Differences in Health Outcomes. Wider use of organ transplants could offer many patients significant improvement in the qualityand duration of their lives while improving the cost-effectiveness oftreatment. Patients with prolonged waiting times are at risk for end-organ deterioration, have an increased risk of transplant failure, ormay die before a donor organ becomes available (Mehta et al.,1995). To estimate the health effects of the availability of xenogeneic hearts, we examined the life expectancy of patients who arecandidates for heart transplants. We assume that xenogeneic hearttransplant patients will have the same survival rate as human hearttransplant recipients. This is Alexion's benchmark for technicalsuccess. Therefore, the per-patient change in QALYs for patientsreceiving UniGraft hearts is equal to the expected life-years forheart transplant patients minus the expected life-years for patientswho are treated with standard heart disease therapy but do notreceive a transplant. We used data from Evans (1993) and theUnited Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS, 1996; 1997) todetermine the change in life expectancy. Number of Beneficiaries We defined the patient population for this technology very conservatively. We assume that the relevant population is patientswho are placed on the heart transplant waiting list maintained bythe UNOS but who do not receive a heart. This definition isnarrow because Alexion believes that if xenogeneic organs areavailable the criteria for being placed on the waiting list will berelaxed, increasing the eligible population. We chose to make amore conservative assumption because we cannot predict whatthese relaxed criteria might be and how many patients mightqualify under them. Table 3-19 shows the expected total number of patients eligible to receive this treatment from 2002 to 2011. It also shows the resultsof our analysis of the expected market penetration of UniGrafthearts. We developed these estimates of market penetration usingChapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-49Market Penetration Year Eligible Patientsa With ATP Without ATP 2002 11,998 1,200 0 a very broad definition of heart transplant candidates that includes all patients who could benefit from a heart transplant below age 65 but cannotreceive one because organs are unavailable (AHA, 1996). the methodology explained in Section 2.3.2. Company representatives provided market penetration estimates for the first 5years. Using these data, we estimated the Bass diffusion model andthe forecast equation (Eq. [2.7]) to determine the expected numberof patients receiving UniGraft hearts for each year in the productionperiod. Changes in Health Care Costs We assume that the cost of a heart transplant using a xenogeneic heart will be the same as the cost of a heart transplant using ahuman donor. This is a very conservative assumption. Alexionbelieves that the availability of xenogeneic organs will decreasecosts of transplants by Zeliminating the need to keep donors on life support, Zreducing hospitalization during recipient waiting time, and Ztransplanting organs to recipients and scheduling surgeries more effectively. As with the cancer diagnosis model, the improvements in life-years will be partially offset by the cost of caring for a person who hasTable 3-19. Expected Market Penetration ofUniGraft Hearts The immediate availability of UniGraft organs would change the use of organ transplantation by Zeliminating long waiting times for donor organs and the associated negative medical effects, Zallowing surgeries to be scheduled optimally, Zeliminating the cost of maintaining a recipient in the hospital while awaiting a donor organ, and Zeliminating the need to keep a donor alive on life support.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-50had a transplant. We assume that the lifetime cost of treating a patient who receives a UniGraft heart is equal to their expectedlife-years times the annual cost of treatment after transplant, plusthe cost of the transplant procedure. The lifetime treatment cost fora patient who does not receive a UniGraft heart is equal to theannual cost of treating a patient before transplant times theirexpected life-years. For patients who receive Unigraft hearts,lifetime health care costs rise because the expected life-years, theannual cost of treatment, and the procedure costs are all higher forUniGraft transplant patients. We used data from Votapka et al.(1995) to determine the annual cost of treating a patient before andafter heart transplant. We used data from AHCPR (1996) todetermine the cost of a heart transplant. The per-patient increase inlifetime health care costs is $102,661. Estimating Private Return on Investment R&D Costs. Alexion's contribution to the cost of the ATP project was $1,204,000. As explained above, we estimate that in theabsence of ATP funding Alexion would have spent $1,963,770 onthis project. Commercialization and Production Costs. Alexion could not provide an estimate of the costs of production andcommercialization. These activities will be handled by Alexion'spartner in commercialization and production. Thus, we used datafrom the biotechnology industry described in Chapter 2 to assumethat commercialization costs would be 37 percent of total revenueand that production costs would be 42 percent of revenue. Summary In the with-ATP scenario, Alexion's 3-year ATP project begins in 1995. The R&D phase is 3 years, the commercialization phase is 4years, and the production phase is 10 years. In the without-ATPscenario, the R&D phase lasts 1 year longer and the productionphase is 1 year shorter. ATP funding led to a 1-year acceleration of the project. It also induced an increase in total R&D spending of over $1.2 million,leading to a 16 percent increase in the probability of technicalsuccess.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-51Alexion's transgeneic UniGraft organs will probably be developed for hearts, kidneys, lungs, and islets. To illustrate the potentialbenefits of the development of these organs, we developed a modelof its impact on heart transplants. In our model, these hearts willbe used for patients who are awaiting a heart transplant but cannotreceive one because of a shortage of donor organs. The defendertechnology is the standard heart disease treatment while awaiting adonor organ. We modeled the health benefits of the availability ofUniGraft organs by comparing the expected life-years of patientsreceiving heart transplants with those who do not. We defined the patient population conservatively as the patients who are placed on the heart transplant waiting list but do notreceive a heart. Using information from company representativesour diffusion model estimates that 1,200 patients will receiveUnigraft hearts in the first year of production; 8,674 patients willreceive UniGraft hearts in the year 2009. We assume that the cost of transplanting a UniGraft heart will be the same as the cost of a human heart transplant. The annual costof treatment for a heart patient that has received a transplant ishigher than a pre-transplant patient. Furthermore, increases in lifeexpectancy increase the lifetime treatment costs for those patientsreceiving UniGraft hearts. Alexion and its partners in commercialization and production will receive revenues from the sale of UniGraft hearts and incur R&D,commercialization, and production costs. We assume thatcommercialization and production costs will be 37 percent and42 percent of revenue, respectively. This model has a number of limitations. First, it considers only heart transplants, although, if successful, Alexion may developother organs as well. Second, the relevant population is definedconservatively, according to current guidelines for acceptance of apatient on the transplant waiting list. Finally, we assume that onlypatients who cannot get a human heart will be candidates for aUniGraft heart; thus, the model does not consider the potentialsavings from xenogeneic transplants as compared to human donortransplants.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-523.2 CASE STUDY RESULTS Each of the technologies discussed in Section 3.1 offers unique benefits to society and specific challenges to modeling theirpotential economic benefits. This section reports the results of ouranalysis of each project and discusses why they differ among theseven projects. It also discussed the limitations of each analysis. 3.2.1 Private and Social Return on Investment in ATP Tissue Engineering Projects Table 3-20 shows the expected social return on public investment for each of the ATP projects examined in this study and for all ofthe projects taken together (the composite). These projectsdemonstrate a wide range of NPV and SRR. As a group, theyprovide over $35 billion in social return on public investment andan SRR of 116 percent over 20 years. These results imply that theATP funding invested in these projects provides an expected netbenefit of over $35 billion dollars to the nation. Table 3-20.

This comparison provides a perspective on theimportance of ATP funding in catalyzing the social return oninvestment. As demonstrated by the composite return, ATP fundingis responsible for inducing about 31 percent of the total socialreturns from all of these projects over 20 years. For the individualprojects, the effect of ATP on social returns ranges from a low of24 percent to 100 percent of social returns. Table 3-21.

Social return on investment in these projects vary with respect to the number of patients that will be treated, the value of the healthbenefits of the new technology, the changes in health care costs,and the probability of technical success. For example, the twoprojects, \"Living Implantable Microreactors\" and \"ProliferatedHuman Islets\" are very similar in many respects. They have similarmedical benefits to the same patient population. The maindifferences between these two projects are the probability oftechnical success, as reported by the companies, and the changesin health care cost. BioHybrid Technologies, Inc., projects a lowerA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-54annual cost for the islet transplant procedure and a higher probability of technical success. The two projects \"Biopolymers for Tissue Repair\" and \"Biomaterials for Clinical Prosthesis\" further demonstrate the sources ofdifferences among projects. The size of the market for these twotechnologies is similar. However, for \"Biomaterials for ClinicalProsthesis,\" market penetration during the production phase isexpected to be more complete. Furthermore, while we did developan estimate of the reduction in health care costs for \"Biopolymersfor Tissue Repair,\" we were not able to quantify any health benefitsfor patients because we could not find any relevant health outcomedata. By comparison, we did quantify a substantial per-patienthealth benefit for \"Biomaterials for Clinical Prosthesis\" because wewere able to collect information regarding the potential healthbenefits. Table 3-22 demonstrates how ATP funding induced increases in social returns. Recall that in our model, ATP might affect thedevelopment of medical technologies by accelerating thetechnology's development, increasing the probability of success (bystimulating additional R&D investment), or widening thetechnology's applications (scope). Table 1-4 shows the magnitudeof these impacts for each project. ATP funding accelerates theprojects by 1 to 10 years, increases the probability of success by 1to 171 percent, and wideness the scope of two projects. The acceleration effect has a much greater impact on the social return on public investment than the probability effect. Table 3-23demonstrates the relative impact of the acceleration effect on thesocial return on public investment. To determine the impact of theacceleration effect only, we calculated the social return on publicinvestment assuming that the probability of technical success inboth scenarios is the same as it is in the with-ATP scenario. Thenwe compared the NPV considering both the probability andacceleration effects to the NPV considering the acceleration effectonly. The table shows that the acceleration effect is responsible for81 percent of the social return on public investment.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-55Table 3-22.

When they reported a 2-year range, we assume the lower number for our analysis. For \"Proliferated Human Islets,\" we used the middle number,4 years, for our analysis. bOur model allows conceptually for a widening of scope effect of ATP. In practice, for the applications examined in this study, there was little or no impact in all but one case, which we did not quantify. Table 3-23.

Although the impact of ATP on social returnswas less dramatic for the remaining projects, it is clear that thesetwo potential sources of ATP's impact on the R&D process haveprovided important increases in social returns. Table 3-24 shows the composite private returns for all of the ATP projects in tissue engineering. 4 The private returns for all projects are significantly lower than their social returns. Although thecomposite NPV is about $1.5 billion, the individual expected NPVvaries widely from over $1 billion to less than zero. IndividualPRRs (not reported) range from about 14 percent to less than zero. Table 3-24. Composite Private Returns: ATP Projects in Tissue Engineering for a Single Preliminary Applicationa NPV (1996$ millions) IRR (%) Project to ATP $914 13% aSee notes to Table 3-20 for an explanation of the derivation of the composite measure of return. From the data we had available for this study, we estimated expected NPV for four of the seven ATP projects in tissueengineering is positive; thus we expect the ATP-sponsoredcompanies and their partners in commercialization and productionto earn profits on the development, commercialization, and sales ofthese technologies. However, because we have modeled these 3Although we were not able to quantify the scope effects, this does not affect the results because the 10-year acceleration of benefits virtually attributes allbenefits of the technology to ATP funding. 4Although the model calculated the private returns on each project, they are not disclosed to preserve the confidentiality of the companies.The results demonstrate that by accelerating R&Dand increasing theprobability oftechnical success,ATP can have animportant impact onthe social return oninvestment.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-57activities together, we do not know how these profits will be distributed among the companies. Three of the seven projects have negative expected private NPV, implying that the ATP-sponsored companies and their partners incommercialization and production will suffer a loss from thedevelopment of these applications of these technologies. However,this result is not surprising given the limitations of our analysis.Recall that the applications considered in this study are only thefirst of many possible applications of ATP-funded technologies.Although three of the seven projects show an expected negativeNPV, ATP-sponsored companies base their investment decisions onthe potential long-term profitability of these technologies in all oftheir applications. Thus, investments in future application willprobably may be more profitable because of the spillovers betweenthe first and future applications. ATP funding has a dramatic impact on the private return on investment in some projects. Although the magnitude of ATP'scontribution to private returns varies by project, our estimate of thetotal contribution to NPV is about $914 million, which is about58 percent of the total. This means that ATP's funding stimulatesadditional private-sector investment and research that yield returnsthat will be significantly higher than they would be without ATPfunding. Two of the companies reported that ATP funding helped them attract other forms of capital. To the extent that this \"halo effect\"reduced their cost of capital, ATP funding may have had anadditional impact on private returns that we did not measure. InSection 3.3, we discuss how we could extend our model to capturethese impacts. The wide disparity between social and private returns indicates the importance of ATP's incentives to the private sector to pursue thesetechnologies. Because the social returns far outweigh the returns tothe companies developing, commercializing, and producing thesetechnologies, the private sector is less likely to fund these kinds ofhigh-risk projects. Hence, ATP funding serves to provide theincentives needed to stimulate the private sector's investments inthese activities. The substantial differences between private and social returns for these projects provide a rationale for encouraging private-sector investment through the ATP program.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-583.2.2 Sources of Project Variations Tables 3-20 through 3-22 demonstrate a wide variation in the social return on public investment and in the social return on investment,in terms of both the NPV and the IRR. Some of the characteristicsof projects that provide a relatively higher expected social return oninvestment have the following characteristics: ZBroad application. Technologies that apply to more patients and diffuse more quickly throughout the patientpopulation have a greater expected social return oninvestment. ZSignificant health benefits. Technologies that lead to more significant improvements in the health of patients over andabove the defender technology will have a greater expectedsocial return on investment. ZCost-effectiveness. Technologies that offer health care improvements at relatively lower costs provide greaterexpected social return on investment. ZHigher probability of technical success. Technologies with a greater expected probability of technical success have ahigher expected social return on investment. The impact of ATP funding on the magnitude of social returns also varies from one project to the next. The primary factors affectingthese differences include the following: ZATP's impact on project timing. The number of years by which ATP funding accelerates the R&D phase of theproject has an important impact on social returns.Conditions that lead to high estimates of the accelerationeffect from ATP funding are the absence of alternativecapital sources and the risk of the project, as perceived bythe company and its potential sources of capital. ZATP's impact on R&D funding and the probability of technical success. The impact of ATP funding on the total R&D investment has an important effect on the social returnon public investment because it affects the project'sexpected probability of technical success. The impact ofATP funding depends on the company's motivation andability to pursue the project in the absence of ATP funds.For all but two projects, ATP stimulated increases in R&Dinvestment sufficient to make a significant difference in theprobability of technical success. In addition, ATP fundingmay have further reduced the company's cost of capital byhelping them to attract other sources of private funding. Wedid not quantify this impact of ATP funding.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-59ZATP's impact on project scope. If ATP funding encourages the company to pursue additional applications and patientpopulations, the social return on the public investment willincrease. Our study investigated only one application ofeach of the technologies studied. We did not explicitlymodel any scope effects for the projects we examined. Thescope effects may be evident in the number of applicationsfor which the technology is eventually used. 3.2.3 Methodological Limitations The results of this study are subject to a number of methodological limitations and assumptions that may affect the results. Some of thelimitations of our analysis include Zanalyzing only a single application of each technology, Zomitting the value of some medical benefits that could not be quantified, Zfailing to quantify ATP's impact on a company's ability to attract other sources of capital, and Zbasing assumptions about costs and benefits on the expectations of informed individuals. Single-Application Analysis This study analyzes only one preliminary application for each project. Because these technologies provide basic scientificplatforms for many applications, their long-term impact may bemuch greater than suggested here, as companies apply theirdiscoveries to a wide variety of medical applications. In addition,the knowledge generated by these initial applications may lead toadvances in unrelated areas by other companies. Limitations of the Health Benefits Models The models we used to quantify the health benefits of each technology have limitations that might affect the results of thestudy. As shown in Table 3-25, some analyses included only aportion of the entire population of patients that might benefit fromthe technology. In other cases, we did not consider all of thepotential health benefits of the technologies, usually because datato support these estimates were not available. Similarly, some ofthe cost savings associated with the technologies may beunderestimated because of our inability to quantify them.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-60Table 3-25.

The economic burdenof a disease is usually divided into three components: directmedical costs, indirect costs, and intangible costs. Direct medicalcosts are the costs of medical treatment. Indirect costs are thesocietal costs associated with the loss in productivity due to illnessand unpaid caregiver time. Intangible costs are due to the patient'spain and suffering. Because we measured the health benefits of these technologies in terms of QALYs, our estimates capture how ATP-fundedtechnologies change both the direct medical costs and theintangible costs of a disease. However, they may not capturechanges in the indirect costs. Improvements in the health of apatient population with a particular illness or injury may reduce theindirect costs of the disease, allowing those receiving an improvedtreatment to lead more productive lives. These benefits to societymay not be captured by QALYs. Health economists disagree about whether QALYs actually do capture changes in indirect costs. While the standard assumption isthat QALYs do not capture indirect costs, some health economistsargue that QALY estimates do include these costs. Assuming thatthe standard assumption is correct, if we were able to fully capturethe changes in indirect costs due to these technologies, ourestimates of the social returns to investment in some of thesetechnologies would be higher. ATP's Impact on Availability of Capital Two companies in our study reported that ATP funding influenced their ability to attract private funding. This \"halo effect\" may havereduced the companies' cost of capital. Conceptually, reducing thecompanies' cost of capital would affect the cost of R&D in the sameway ATP funding affects it. That is, as the cost of R&D effort falls,the level of effort rises, increasing the probability of technicalsuccess. Although we did not quantify the benefits of thismechanism of ATP impact, we could modify our methodology toincorporate this effect as explained below.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-62Data Limitations Because none of these technologies have yet reached the commercial market though several are in clinical trials the results of this analysis are based, in part, on the expectations of theinnovators and other informed individuals. We do not know at thistime whether these expectations will be realized. However, themethodology we employed can be used to update our estimates asbetter data on the actual costs and benefits of the technologiesbecome available. We examined the sensitivity of our results to our assumptions about some of the most uncertain parameters in our model. The results ofthe sensitivity analyses are reported in Appendix B. We examinedthe sensitivity of social returns to the following parameters: Zdiscount rate, Zper-patient treatment costs and QALYs, and Zprobability of technical success. We examined the sensitivity of private returns to several key parameters: Zdiscount rate, Zcommercialization cost percentage, Zproduction cost percentage, Zproduct price, and Zprobability of technical success. We found that the results are fairly sensitive to the predictions about the technologies' costs and effectiveness by doctors andcompany representatives. As these technologies develop, estimatesof their costs and effectiveness may change dramatically, or theirtechnical success may prove impossible. As better informationbecomes available, we should consider adjusting these estimates toincorporate more accurate forecasts of these costs and benefits. 3.3 CONCLUSIONS AND POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS The objectives of this project were to Zdevelop a methodology for estimating the expected social economic return on public investment in ATP-fundedprojects with medical applications,Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-63Zillustrate this methodology by applying it to seven ATP- funded projects in tissue engineering, Zestimate the social return on public investment in these seven ATP projects, and Zprovide insight regarding the factors that affect the social return on public investment in ATP-funded projects withmedical applications. This section offers conclusions about the suitability of this methodology for estimating the private and social return oninvestment in medical and other technologies and ways thismethodology might be improved. It also discusses our conclusionswith respect to the social and private returns on investments ineach of the case study technologies and offers observations aboutwhy these results differ among the case studies. 3.3.1 Developing, Applying, and Improving the Methodology To address the specific methodological challenges of modeling and estimating the economic return on investment in new medicaltechnologies, we extended the currently accepted framework forcalculating private and social returns. We incorporated nonmarketmethods for valuing the benefits of these technologies to patients.We illustrated this methodology by applying it to seven ATP-fundedprojects in tissue engineering. Applicability of this Methodology This methodology is useful for analyzing ATP-funded medical technologies, particularly under the following conditions: ZOne or several primary applications are apparent. ZThe health outcome and resource cost differences between the new and defender technologies can be quantified (e.g.,because some clinical trials or other studies have producedthe required data). ZThe impact of changes in health outcomes on patients' well- being has been quantified by other studies (e.g., QALYs forhealth outcomes or health states are available). ZThe market potential for the new technology is apparent. ZThe technology is sufficiently close to commercialization to enable company representatives to project the costs ofcommercialization and production.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-64Aside from medical technologies, this methodology is also applicable to other situations in which the technology affects goodsand services whose values are not adequately reflected in marketprices. For example, technologies that improve environmentalquality or reduce the crime rate provide benefits that are not pricedin the market. Nonmarket valuation methods are required to valuethese kinds of social benefits. As in this study, valuation of thesesocial benefits requires determining the beneficiaries' willingness topay for these improvements. Potential Methodological Improvements The methodology we developed and applied in this study might be improved in several ways. These potential improvements involve Zimproving our model of the impact of ATP funding on company investment behavior, Zforecasting the impact of distant applications, and Zmodeling the decline in market penetration. Modeling the Impact of ATP Funding on Company Investments. Constructing a without-ATP scenario is the most challenging task in calculating social and private returns. Because the without-ATPcase is the counterfactual, we must rely on the company'sconjectures about what they might have done in the absence of anATP grant. Clearly, better information about how companiesrespond to ATP grants could improve our estimates of the without-ATP scenario. First, ATP needs to understand how companies react to changes in the real cost of R&D. ATP seeks to identify projects that would notbe funded to the same degree by the private sector. Informationabout how a company's size, scope, ownership structure, age, andR&D portfolio affect its R&D investment decisions could shed somelight on these issues. An ex post empirical analysis of the private return on investment in projects funded with alternative sources offunds could identify points on the marginal benefits curve relatingthe cost of R&D to its returns. Second, ATP needs to understand exactly how its funding affects the cost of R&D. In this study, we assume that in the absence ofATP the cost of an R&D dollar is equal to $1, and that with ATP thecost of an R&D dollar is the ratio of the company's ATP match toAside from medical technologies, this methodology is alsoapplicable to thatare not priced in themarket. ATP funding may reduce the cost of R&D effort by reducing the cost of other sources of funding. We could improve the model by incorporating empirical estimates of these differences in cost to demonstrate how they further encourage R&D effort and improve the probability of technical success.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-65the total project budget. But the difference between the price of R&D in the with-ATP scenario versus without-ATP scenariodepends on the cost of alternative funding. ATP funding mayreduce the cost of R&D effort not only by subsidizing the project'sbudget, but also by helping the company attract other sources offunding and reducing the cost of capital. If companies couldprovide an empirical estimate of the impact of ATP funding on thecost of capital, it could be incorporated into the model, and wecould demonstrate how these decreases in the cost of capital furtherencourage company R&D and improve the probability of technicalsuccess. Forecasting Impacts of Distant Applications. Analyzing the most immediate and probable application of an ATP project provides themost reliable data regarding its potential impacts. However,ignoring the later applications probably underestimates the project'sbenefits. The challenge of collecting data regarding these distant applications can be significant. Because the expected benefits lie farther intothe future, all of the data required to calculate social returns,including the size of the expected patient population, theappropriate defender technology, and the costs of health careresources, become more and more uncertain. Data regardingexpected private returns may be even more difficult to gather, sincethe companies will be very reluctant to forecast spending on R&D,commercialization, and production for applications that arerelatively remote. A potential approach to this problem may be to draw from existing or prospective studies of project spillovers. An empirical analysisof trends in the returns to the application of an enabling technologyas it ages may provide a general guideline for forecasting thereturns from later applications. For example, a retrospective studyof the medical applications resulting from the development ofultrasound techniques might show that the return on investment ineach successive application of the techniques rise at first, thendecline as the enabling technology ages and is replaced by a newtechnique. Analyzing this pattern could help ATP determine howmany distant applications should be examined to capture themajority of the returns. Existing or prospective studies of project spillovers may provide a general guideline for forecasting the return on investment in later applications of ATP- funded technologies.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies 3-66Improving Market Penetration Forecasts. While the Bass model is a generally accepted model for forecasting the diffusion of newtechnologies, it has one important drawback for studying ATP-funded enabling technologies. The cumulative number of adopterspredicted by the Bass model is strictly increasing over time. Yettechnologies depreciate over time as new technologies emerge andconsumer needs and tastes change. Thus, a diffusion model isneeded that accounts for the future emergence of technologies thatwill replace the ATP-funded technology. One way to think of sucha model is that it actually forecasts the diffusion of twotechnologies: the ATP-funded technology and its replacement. Our ability to determine what these replacement technologies might be and their pattern of diffusion limits our ability toimplement the double-diffusion method outlined above. However,we could develop empirical data about the likely pattern ofobsolescence of ATP-funded technologies by analyzing thediffusion patterns of existing medical technologies. For example,we could examine the diffusion patterns of two drugs introduced atdifferent times but with the same application. The objective of thisanalysis would be to examine the factors that affect how quickly anew technology is superseded by an even newer technology. 3.3.2 Summary of Social Returns from Seven ATP Projects in Tissue Engineering If successful, these technologies and their applications will improve the quality of life for thousands of people every year. Among thetechnologies we examined, the medical benefits include Za less painful, invasive, and expensive system for transplanting bone marrow cells; Za bioabsorbable fracture fixation device that will eliminate the need for removal surgery and improve healing offractures; Za virtual cure for the negative health effects of diabetes; Za system for making donor organs more widely available; Za diagnostic technique that improves the detection of cancer metastasis, which increases the effectiveness ofcancer treatment; and Za material that will improve the effectiveness of ligament repair.We know very little about how quickly the value of new medical technologies depreciates through the emergence of treatments and technologies that render them obsolete.Chapter 3 \u2014 Tissue Engineering Case Studies 3-67Our analysis of the social and private benefits of these technologies yields the following findings: ZThe expected social return on ATP public investment in these technologies, or the increment to social returnsattributable to ATP funding, is estimated at $34 billion innet present value. ZThe expected social rate of return on ATP public investment in these technologies is estimated at an annual rate of 116 percent. ZThe expected total social return on public and private investment in these technologies is estimated at $112 billionin net present value, or an annual rate of 115 percent. ZThe expected total private return on investment in these technologies to ATP-award companies and their partners incommercialization and production is estimated at$1.6 billion in net present value, or an annual rate of12 percent. Of the $1.6 billion in net present value ofprivate returns, $914 million is estimated to be attributableto ATP funding. ZTo the extent that the technologies will yield applications in addition to those we investigated, it is likely that public andprivate returns on these projects will be higher. These results illustrate two important points about the role of ATP in funding these technologies: ZATP plays a significant role in increasing the expected social and private returns on these projects. ZThe social returns far outweigh the benefits to the private sector. Private companies will therefore tend to underinvestin these technologies compared to what would be optimalfrom society's perspective. The wide disparity betweensocial and private returns indicates the importance of ATP'sincentives to the private sector to pursue these technologies. Three factors affect the social return on public investment in projects with medical applications: Zthe number of years by which ATP funding accelerates the R&D phase of the project, Zthe impact of ATP funding on the probability of technical success, and Zthe impact of ATP funding on the scope of the project.R-1References Adams, P.F., and M.A. Marano. 1995.

For the four in-depth casestudies listed in Table 1-1, we conducted more in-depth casestudies than for the remainder of the projects. For the in-depth casestudies, we interviewed physicians to obtain data for the Bassdiffusion model, as explained in Section 2. For the remainder ofthe companies, we collected diffusion estimates for the Bass modelfrom the companies' representatives. A.1 INTERVIEW MATERIALS Figures A-1 through A-4 contain the clinical profiles we developedand provided to physicians prior to the interviews. We did notidentify the company, either on the profile or during the interview. Figure A-5 is a sheet of questions that we sent to the physicians along with the clinical profile. It was designed to prepare thephysicians to answer our questions. Figure A-6 contains theinformal interview guide that we used while interviewing thephysicians over the telephone. Table A-1 provides information about the physicians we interviewed. These physicians were recommended to us as expertsin the treatment of the relevant diseases by ATP-sponsoredcompanies, by associations such as the American DiabetesAssociation, or by other physicians. A.2 DATA COLLECTED Table A-2 contains the data that we collected from the physiciansand company representatives for input to the model. For some of theprojects, the physicians identified and provided market penetrationestimates for a number of different populations. In these cases, wedivided the eligible population into these segments and developedweighted averages for input to the Bass diffusion model. Forexample, for the project \"Biopolymers for Tissue Repair,\" the totaleligible population was 73,875; 33,825 adults and 40,050 children.Expert 1 forecasted a market cap of 25 percent for adults and75 percent for children as his estimate for the market cap. Therefore,we used 38,494 as his forecast of the market cap for this technology.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies A-2Figure A-1. Clinical Profile for \"Human Stem Cell and Hematopoietic Expansion Systems\" Many patients with dose-sensitive cancers are treated with high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation. To enable the patient to survive this treatment, patients are treated with stem celltherapy to repair the damage to their hematopoietic system. In many cases, the stem cells areharvested from the patient prior to the myelotoxic treatment or from a donor via peripheral bloodprogenitor cell (PBPC) collection. PBPC requires the use of mobilization drugs that may haveside effects for the patient or donor. Assume that a new method for stem cell harvest is now available. This new method involves extracting a small quantity of bone marrow (a single aspirate) in a doctor's office under localanesthesia. The aspirate is placed in a Cell Production System (CPS) which is fully automated forgrowing stem cells outside the human body. This method may reduce the probability thatcertain tumor cells will be reintroduced via the graft. Please examine the clinical profile below and think about the current stem cell harvest techniques versus the new treatment we described above. Then, answer the questions on thefollowing page. Expected cost of new treatment per patient, including all resourcesrequired for stem cell harvest:No more than $12,000. Likely alternative treatment and treatment cost:Peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization. $12,000- $20,000 Risks/side-effects: No drugs or procedures required to prepare the patient for the procedure prior to the time of the aspirate. Ease of use: It is very easy to use and requires limited training.

A.3 KEY FINDINGS FROM INTERVIEWS We highlight key findings from the physician interviews by project. Stem Cell Expansion ZIn addition to autologous bone marrow transplants (BMTs), physicians believed this procedure would be useful forpatients receiving multicyclic subablative chemotherapyand umbilical cord stem cell transplants. ZTwo physicians stated that there are technical barriers to using this treatment for allogeneic transplants due to graftrejection, graft versus host disease, and the inability torestore blood cells to the level they need to be. ZBarriers to this treatment's market success cited by physicians interviewed include the cost of capitalequipment for health maintenance organizations (HMOs),hospitals, and BMT centers; the ease of training; andphysicians' belief in the procedure's reliability to grow stemcells. One physician said that a disadvantage of thetreatment is that once the cell expansion has started, theA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies A-12cells will have to be used on a given date and cannot be \"saved\" until a later date, in the event that a patient isunable to undergo the transplant. ZPhysicians and CEOs of hospitals and managed care organizations were cited as being most influential indetermining whether the treatment will become widelyused. ZPhysicians stated that the possibility of reducing tumor cells in a graft will be extremely important in determining thetreatment's market acceptance; however, this factor will notbe important in terms of modeling health outcomes. Biopolymers for Tissue Repair ZPhysicians noted the differences between the pediatric orthopedic market and the adult orthopedic market. Thepediatric market has a high removal rate for pins(95 percent) because physicians are reluctant to leave pinsin growing bone. However, the removal rate for adults iscloser to 10 to 15 percent. ZOne physician said that the only adult population this would be applicable for is healthy adult patients with low-load nondiaphyseal fractures. ZBarriers to this treatment that were cited included physicians' concern, even if it is misinformation, aboutpossible reactions to bioabsorbable materials versus inertmetals; the ability to use bioabsorbables mechanically aseasily as metals are used; the fact that biodegradabledevices may not have the same degree of interfragmentalcompression; and the higher cost of bioabsorbablematerials. ZOne surgeon said that surgeons will be most influential in determining whether these devices become widely used if they find the devices comparable to the metal devices. Living Implantable Microreactors ZPhysicians believed that the eligible population is identical to that for VivoRx's technology. ZThe biggest barriers cited to this treatment's widespread use are the fact that human and porcine islets are good reservoirsfor retroviruses, and the long-term effects of porcineretroviruses are not known. Cost was also cited as a barrier. Proliferated Human Islets ZPhysicians confirmed that the eligible populations for this treatment are Type I diabetics and 10 percent of Type IIdiabetics (those who are insulin-dependent). The onlygroup not eligible for this treatment is women who arepregnant or considering getting pregnant.Appendix A \u2014 Market Diffusion Interview Materials, Summaries, and Results A-13ZOne physician believes that children and young adults who are beyond puberty and have already shown some complications related to diabetes will be the ideal group forboth VivoRx's and BioHybrid's treatments, since themedical community will do anything to prevent furthercomplications in such young patients. ZOne physician stated that if we can clone human cells, these should be better than porcine cells; however, there isa big reservoir of porcine cells, so availability should not bean issue. ZThe biggest barriers cited to this treatment's widespread use include \u00eacost, which far exceeds current diabetes therapy, especially for young parents with young (less than 10years of age) diabetic children; \u00eaavailability of tissue for transplantation; \u00eathe government, which may be overly restrictive in regulating the number of patients able to receive eithertherapy (VivoRx or BioHybrid); \u00eapharmaceutical companies that are large producers of insulin and insulin-related products; \u00eaconcerns about unrecognized malignant cell transmission; and \u00ealong-term immunological effects of this type of transplantation. ZPhysicians predicted that the American Diabetes Association and professional endocrine societies will beinfluential in determining how widespread this treatmentbecomes. One physician believed it will be primarilypatient-driven, because many patients will be willing to paymore for improving lifestyles (i.e., reduction in glucosemonitoring). A.4 RESULTS OF MODEL ESTIMATES Table A-3 summarizes the results of our diffusion modeling. The forecasted estimate is the quantity of patients used in the model forestimating returns.

B.1 SENSITIVITY OF SOCIAL RETURNS We examined the sensitivity of the social return on publicinvestment and the social return on investment to the followingparameters: Zdiscount rate, Zper-patient treatment costs and QALYs, and Zprobability of technical success. B.1.1 Sensitivity to the Discount Rate Changing the discount rate has a complex effect on the social NPV. First, if the technology has a QALY impact, it affects the totalnumber of QALYs gained per patient, since QALYs that occur laterin life are discounted. Second, it affects the value of a QALY, asexplained in Section 2. Finally, it affects the rate at which theexpected net benefits are discounted. Table B-1 shows the value of the social NPV when the discount rate is 5 percent and 1 percent. The composite social returns on allprojects are about 40 percent lower than baseline at a 5 percentdiscount rate and about 75 percent higher than baseline at a1 percent discount rate. For most projects, decreasing the discountrate increases the NPV of social returns. For one project,\"Proliferated Human Islets,\" the social benefits are negative at a5 percent discount rate because at this rate the discounted value ofthe lifetime health-related benefits per patient is less than thediscounted lifetime cost of treatment. Because the per-patient netbenefits are negative for this project, the impact of ATP on thereturn on investment from this project is also negative, because thewith-ATP scenario includes more patients. The increase in thediscount rate decreases the value of improvements in the quality oflife, which occur late in life relative to the cost of treatment.A Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies B-2Table B-1. Social Return on Investment and Social Return on Public Investment: ATP Projects in Tissue Engineering for a Single Application: 5 and 1 Percent Discount Rates(NPV 1996$ millions) 5 Percent 1 Percent ATP ProjectExpected Social Return on InvestmentExpected Social Return on Public InvestmentExpected Social Return on InvestmentExpected Social Return on Public Investment Stem Cell Expansion $94 Estimates of Health Benefits The health benefits models estimate the benefits of ATP-funded technologies in tissue engineering by calculating the change in thecost of treating patients and the change in the benefits to patients interms of QALYs. Table B-2 demonstrates the sensitivity of theresults with respect to the change in the cost of treatment and theQALYs gained by using the new technology. The table shows thepercentage change in each project's social NPV when the per-patient cost or the per-patient change in QALYs is varied by25 percent. With the exception of \"Proliferated Human Islets,\"none of the results are overly sensitive to our data regarding thesebenefits and costs. However, the results for this project are verysensitive to both of these estimates partly because the percentagechanges are calculated on a small base. If the company revises itsestimates of the cost of the diabetes treatment, or if we can developmore accurate estimates of the QALYs gained by this treatment, thesocial returns from this project may be substantially larger orsmaller.Social returns are relatively insensitive to changes in per-patient treatmentcost and QALYs,except for oneproject.Appendix B \u2014 Sensitivity Analysis B-3Percentage Change in Expected Social Return on Investment (NPV) ATP Project Cost QALYs Stem Cell Expansion 25% 26% Universal Donor Organs 7% 18% NA = not applicable B.1.3 Sensitivity to the Probability of Technical Success Table B-3 shows how the results of our analysis change if we assume that the probability of technical success is equal to 1. Notethat in our model, the expected benefits and costs following the R&D phase are multiplied by the probability of technical success. The table shows how our estimates of the social return on publicinvestment, NPV, and IRR would be different if there was nouncertainty about the technical success of these projects. Althoughthe NPV is significantly higher in some cases, the IRR does notchange a great deal because both costs and benefits in thecommercialization and production phases are multiplied by theprobability of technical success. B.2 SENSITIVITY OF PRIVATE RETURNS This section describes the sensitivity of private returns to severalkey parameters: Zdiscount rate, Zcommercialization cost percentage, Zproduction cost percentage, Zproduct price, and Zprobability of technical success.Table B-2. Sensitivity of Social NPV to a 25Percent Change in Per-Patient Treatment Costand QALYsA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies B-4Table B-3.

For the probability oftechnical success, we compared the value of composite NPV underthe baseline assumptions to the NPV when the probability ofsuccess is 1. For the other variables, we varied them from theirbaseline values by 25 percent and calculated the percentagechange in composite NPV. B.2.1 Sensitivity of Results With Respect to the Discount Rate As shown in Table B-4, our estimates of private return on investment are fairly sensitive to the discount rate assumption.Increasing the discount rate from 3 percent to 5 percent changescomposite private returns by about 38 percent from the baselineresult. Decreasing the discount rate from 3 percent to 1 percentincreases composite NPV by about 54 percent.Appendix B \u2014 Sensitivity Analysis B-5Table B-4. Private NPV for ATP Projects in Tissue Engineering for a Single Preliminary Application: 5 and 1 Percent Discount Rates (1996$ millions) 5 Percent 1 Percent Project returns $977 $2,409 Increment attributable to ATP $589 $1,369 B.2.2 Sensitivity of Results with Respect to Cost Parameters As explained in Section 2, we had very little data on costs that companies would incur during commercialization and production.In the absence of information from the companies, we developedassumptions for these variables based on average values in thepharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We assumed that the Zcommercialization cost is 37 percent of expected revenue and Zvariable cost of production is 42 percent of revenue. We also made various assumptions about product price, based on our interviews with company representatives. Table B-5 shows thepercentage change in composite NPV given a 25 percent change inthese parameters. The sensitivity of the NPV estimates varieswidely across projects. For some projects, the NPV is very sensitiveto these assumptions. The composite returns are most sensitive tochanges in our assumptions about production cost andcommercialization cost. Thus, our confidence about our estimatesof private returns depends largely on our certainty about theseassumptions. Given that we used secondary industry information,we believe these estimates can be improved in the future byupdating them with data from the companies when it is available. Parameter Percentage Change in Composite NPV Commercialization cost 67% Production cost 72% Product price 28%Composite private return on investment is most sensitive to changes in assumptions about the commercialization cost and the cost of production. Table B-5. Sensitivity of Results with Respect toKey ParametersA Framework for Estimating the National Economic Benefits of ATP Funding of Medical Technologies B-6B.2.3 Sensitivity to the Probability of Technical Success Table B-6 shows how the composite private return on investment changes if we assume that the probability of technical success isequal to 1. The table shows how our estimates of the compositeNPV and IRR would be different if there was no uncertainty aboutthe technical success of these projects. The composite NPV isabout 66 percent higher when we assume that all projects aresuccessful. However, the IRR does not change because the costs ofcommercialization and production are higher, as are the benefits,when we are certain of success.
