My favorite thing to do on a Full Moon is to take a detoxifying and meditative salt bath. It is said that during the Full Moon the body benefits the most from taking salt baths because it's capacity for absorption of the minerals is heightened during this time. Below is a step-by-step ritual you can use to to get the most out of your Full Moon Bath. 1. Creating Space For Magic Although you may not think cleaning your bathroom or tub is an actual part of the ritual bath itself, it's actually a very crucial step in creating your ideal space and clearing the energy for your bath. A completely clean bathroom and tub will allow for less distraction and ultimate relaxation. Take your time as you deep clean your tub. You can use natural cleaning products or you can even make your own with a vinegar & water base and add in your favorite cleansing essential oils like tea tree & citrus oils, to ensure peace of mind that you're not soaking yourself in a chemical cocktail. After wiping it down, give your bathtub a final rinse with hot water. 2. Gather Your Favorite Items Find your most favorite and fluffy towel, a book if you like to read and I always make sure to bring a journal just in case a great thought comes to me in the tub. Don't forget a cold glass of water to cool you off and anything else you need to feel completely comfortable. My favorite crystals to incorporate into my bath include grounding stones like smokey quartz, clear quartz to amplify the energy and heart opening stones like Rose Quartz. If you are going to add them to the bath itself, make sure they are stones that can get wet, for example, Selenite can actually disintegrate in water. Adding in an element of fire such as candles, sage or palo santo, is a great way to diffuse and release energy during your bath. 3. Draw A Healing Bath Begin to fill your tub with water at a temperature you deem to be perfect. Drop in your favorite salt-based bath product like our Meditative Moon Dust bath or create your own. Adding in dry flowers can make the experience even more luxurious and relaxing. Begin to dim the lights, light your candles and put on soft music to set the mood even more. It is actually been proven that playing binaural beats can calm anxiety and increase dopamine (feel good) chemicals in your brain. But make this bath completely your own, listen to what your body wants, even if that means playing your new favorite hip-hop album. 4. Let Yourself Soak Climb into the tub and find your most relaxing position, maybe using a small towel behind your neck or head. Just let yourself be. This is where the healing begins. You can practice a small grounding exercise by closing down your eyes. Focus on your breath and try to tap into exactly how your body feels. Know that it is perfect just the way it is lying in the tub. Tune into all of your senses and the energy around you. Feel the temperature of the water on your skin, smell of the oils in the tub or scent of the candles burning, hear the dripping of the faucet, see the flickering of the candle light against the wall and the way the flowers dance along the water. Once you've grounded down, use this time to do whatever feels best in the moment, knowing that every bath may be different. Sometimes it's reading or writing, other times it may be meditating or gentle stretching. Stay in your bath for as long as it feels comfortable. 5. Finalizing Magic Mindfully bringing your space back to normal is just as much a part of the ritual as setting it up was. Take your time as you begin to drain the water. I like to keep the candles lit and move them right outside of the tub in order to shower and rinse my body in the same relaxing light. Visualize the water rinsing away toxins and cleansing your entire body in new light energy. After all of the water is drained, wipe any dried flowers that have gathered on the base of the tub or drain with a paper towel. You can even add these to your compost or to any plant's soil. Rinse the tub with hot water and wipe it again with your natural cleaner if you used any highly oily products. Notice how your body feels once you have completed your Full Moon Bath. If you had any profound realizations or ideas while in the tub, be sure to journal them down. And make sure to drink plenty of water afterwards for rehydration and to help flush out any remaining toxins.
