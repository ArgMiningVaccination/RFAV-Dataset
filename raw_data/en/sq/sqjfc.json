In the pages that follow, you will enjoy learning about more than 150 projects that led to tangible, measurable and sustained improvements by teams committed to improving patient care. Just as our metric -driven da shboards tell a certain narrative about our org anizational performance, these initiatives add to that narrative in demonstrating that improvement wo rk truly occurs everywhere. The work represented is concrete evidence of our vision to be the best provider of health care services, the best place to work, and the best environment for teaching and research. Why are we hosting our 3rd Annual Improvement Poster Symposium? The opportunities to learn from each other, share best practices and innovations, and bui ld a community for improvement work are critically important for our patients and the success of UCSF Health. An annual poster symposium provides a vehicle to recognize great people, teams and work, while foster ing our culture for continuous improvement. What types of improvement work are highlighted? A diversity of improvement work is being shared in the pages that follow. These are aligned with key priority areas within our True North Pillars of Patient Experience, Quality/Safety, Our People, Financial Strength, Strategic Growth and Learning Health System. They also touch important themes across our pillars, such as interprofessional teams, information technology and health equity. Who was invited to submit projects for the symposium? Any provider, nu rse, staff member, or trainee (e.g. students, residents, fellows, postdocs) who completed a project within a UCSF Health clinical setting was encouraged to submit a poster. What is our UCSF Resident & Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Progra m? It's an innovative program and partnership between our clinical enterprise and Graduate Medical Education where training programs are offered an opportunity to choose an organizationally -aligned quality improvement project. This past year, more than 30 programs participated and we've included many of their posters to further highlight the tremendous work. What is the Bridges Clinical Microsystem Clerkship ? It's an innovative longitudinal clinical skills course that involves having first -year medica l students work within interprofessional teams to learn about and contribute to improvement work . We've included the student projects that were completed within a UCSF Health site to demonstrate the impact early learners can have on improving quality, safety and the patient experience . We hope you enjoy learning about the wonderful improvement work included here, adopt interventions that provide solutions to a problem in your own clinical setting, and collaborate with your colleagues to share best practices. We're incredibly grateful to the teams who we have the opportunity to recognize with this program booklet and are inspired by the dedication and high expectations they've set for future improvement symposia.

The Target state is to improve HCAHPS score (pain management part) by 20 % by the end of June 2019 Next Steps : Coordinate the usage of the algorithm by pain committee members Survey staff to determine the usefulness of algorithm Present algorithm at annual skills validation class Dissemination: Present at hospital wide clinical practice committee Present at CN3 quarterly meeting Present at hospital wide pain committee meeting Lessons Learned: During a project, unexpected opportunities and challenges arise that impact an improvement effort. Please describe the most important lesson(s) learned about your team's efforts. 13Long is a General Surgery Unit that is mostly populated with post operative patients who often require comple x pain management for their recovery. The various challenges in achievin g effective pain control include : 1. Fast growing population of chronic pain patients and the increase of opioid tolerance which result in increase complexity in pain management 2. The variation of knowledge inpain management among surgical teams. 3. Absence of a structuralguideline on complex pain management for inexperienced or trainee RNs. 4. Insufficient patient education on pain control prior to surgery which often causes increased anxiety when the pain is higher than excepted. 5. Task-oriented nursing care that allows less time for critical thinking for the optimal pain management Inadequate pain management is directly related to patient's safety and satisfaction. As a certified pain management RN and CN III, my goal is to improve patient satisfaction and safety while addressing the issues above. The algorithm is currently being used by 13 Long RNs on a variety of surgical patients. -Preceptor RNs introduce s the algorithm to newly hired RNs while educating the pain management principle on 13long -It has been a helpful visual guides to troubleshoot complex pain control issues, RN's encounter with a various patients types. The plan for further evaluation would be analyzing HCAHPS scores and its trending . 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Post Operative Pain Management Decision Tree Eunhye Kim CN3 13Long/Pain Committee/ General Surgery Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned 2Purpose/ Objective 1.Produce a validated tool to aid in assessment of Pressure Injury Risk Factors as well as guide the Clinical OR Nurse in implementing preventative positioning aids to decrease the risk of HAPI as it pertains to the pediatric surgical patient population 2.Address and rectify current barriers to instituting cultural and practice changes in the Operating Room including: a)Poor quality hand- off communication between OR staff and recovery units b)Complex electronic documentation of skin assessment in the Intraoperative record which did not translate to the inpatient nursing chart c)Minimal educational resources for staff on optimal patient positioning practice d)Inconsistent positioning supplies and equipment for staff 3.Decrease the incidence of pressure injuries in the pediatric surgical patient population after implementation of a pressure injury prevention tool in the operating roomNext Steps:Complete and implement positioning algorithm/tool. Coordinating annual multidisciplinary hands- on education to standardize this practice. Evaluate knowledge gaps around positioning products, methods and usage and adjust as necessary. Continue gathering case data to strengthen validation of tool. Dissemination: This work is being shared with leaders in the UCSF adult operating rooms to determine shared benefits of the implementation efforts. Project shared with all Clinical Nurse Leaders within UCSF to determine universal utilization of tools in other pediatric clinical areas. Lessons Learned: More research and data needs to be collected to validate tool. Cultural change in the Operating room is difficult and needs the support of all stakeholders. Communication is one of the keys to success and is necessary to achieve cooperation and transparency. Between 1- 2.5 million Hospital Acquired Pressure Injuries (HAPI) occur annually. A review of literature reveals significant risk factors for developing pressure injuries in patients undergoing surgery. Hospital acquired skin injury and pressure injuries are a serious and preventable problem shown to increase costs, length of stay, place the patient at an increased risk of infection, and patient suffering. Problem:At UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, in fiscal year 2017 there were 31 incident reports in the Skin/Tissue category, 16 of these reports being hospital acquired pressure injuries, compared to 4 HAPI's in the previous fiscal year. All of these injuries originated in the pediatric perioperative area. A multidisciplinary pressure injury prevention work group was created to look into gaps in practice, identify areas of improvement, and implement pressure injury prevention strategies in our pediatric perioperative areas. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Preventing Pediatric Perioperative Skin Injuries Anjal Pong, RN, CNE Chrissie Smith, RN, CNS, CWOCN Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Think \"SKIN\" Skinand Risk Assessment Keep repositioning off pressure points Identify potential injury and intervene Notify next phase of care FY2017 Pediatric OR Skin/Tissue IR's: 31 IR's for skin related issues. 16 of these IR's were HAPI's Compared to 4 HAPI's in FY2016 & 4 in FY2015 UCSF Benioff Operating Room Pressure Injury Prevention Guide 3The goal of this project is to evaluate if this reporting change safely reduced treatment directed at C. difficile in colonized patients. Next Steps: Consider testing by PCR only on request Monitor for adverse events resulting from withholding treatment Dissemination: As part of a UC -wide initiative, the results will be analyzed and published. These data can be paired with bigger picture unit performance regarding C. difficile prevention measures as reduced antibiotic exposure may lead to a reduced incidence of the disease. Lessons Learned: C. difficile is a complex challenge that require creative approaches to enhance our efforts in improving patient care. A multidisciplinary team is essential to developing and executing a successful institutional change. C. difficile infection (CDI) is a serious hospital- acquired infection Testing methods for C. difficile have evolved over time to become more sensitive UCSF uses a two -step algorithm that incorporates detection of C. difficile bacteria, toxin protein, and toxin gene as follows: Recent data suggests that patients carrying C. difficile bacteria with the gene for toxin but no detectable toxin protein may be colonized and not require treatment ( Polage CR 2017, only 35% of positive tests for C. difficile at UCSF were toxin protein positive, indicating that our high rate of positivity may be driven by colonized patients UCSF participated in a multi- center project to revise the language for CDI test results. Specifically, reporting for toxin- negative/PCR -positive (gene) carriers: Toxin protein: Not detected Toxin gene: DETECTED Comment: Detection of bacteria that have the toxin gene but do not produce toxin protein likely reflects colonization with toxigenic C. difficile instead of clinical infection. Correlate with clinical information; contact Infectious Diseases for help with interpretation and management.Although the majority of these patients were still treated, a treatment reduction greater than 25% was observed. Patients carrying C. difficile bacteria with the gene for toxin but no detectable protein were less likely to be treated after the change in reporting (p=0.0009). 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium The Impact of Change in Test Reporting on Antibiotic Treatment Targeted at C. difficile Lusha Wang, MPH, CIC1, Laurel Gibbs, CLS/MT(ASCP), PhD3, Amy Nichols, MBA, Lynn Ramirez, MD, MS1, Sarah Doernberg, MAS2 1Hospital Epidemiology & Infection Control 2Antibiotic Stewardship 3Laboratory Medicine Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned We hypothesized that the change in the C. difficile reporting would result in a reduction in C. difficile targeted treatment given to patients whose tests are positive by PCR only, which represent presence of toxin gene but no detectable toxin protein production. A multidisciplinary team worked together in preparing for the hospital- wide change in C. difficile reporting . Figure 1. All inpatient C. difficile tests from Parnassus and Mission Bay. The baseline period is between 7/1/2014 - 7/9/2017 and the post period is 7/10/2017 onwards. Test results displayed as GDH/Toxin/PCR. PCR used to detect the C. difficile toxin gene and tests only reflex to PCR if GDH is positive but toxin is negative. Treatment equates to the following antibiotics given to patient following final test result: PO vancomycin, PO/IV metronidazole and PO fidaxomicin .

To determine the safety and tolerability of a one -hour accelerated infliximab infusion compared to a two-hour standard infusion in patients with IBD. Next steps/ dissemination: Expand accelerated infliximab infusion into the pediatric population. Lessons learned: Assessing for value via chart review can be time consuming and some endpoints such as patient satisfaction can be difficult to evaluate. Infliximab is one of the more effective treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Lengthy administration time (>2 hours) represents a significant inconvenience to patients who receive regular maintenance infusions. Recent studies show that infusion over 30 -60 minutes is safe in patients receiving maintenance therapy. On June 14, 2017, UCSF adult infusion clinics adopted an accelerated infusion protocol to infuse infliximab over one hour. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Implementation of Accelerated Infliximab Infusion Protocol in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Jeremie Aviado , BS Danning Ma, Pharm.D Wong, Pharm.D Helen Wu, Pharm.D .

Janssen Biotech, Inc., 2015. 5UCSF Department ofNursing had arelatively new simulation lab with high- fidelity full body mannequins .Didactic/water drills were meeting cognitive needs, but simulation is better fortechnical and behavioral learning . Furthermore, asimulation environment remains asafe place tolearn and make mistakes . Our group wanted toimprove the learning environment by training 100% of10ICC nurses new toECMO/ECLS with simulation classes tailored tothe unique needs ofour patient population and staff .Next Steps: Modification of the curriculum for the next cohort will be based on trainer and trainee feedback. In addition, we identified the need to develop and incorporate formal pre and post metrics to assess and measure staff learning and the need to expand simulation to other clinical topics. Dissemination: The integration of a simulation based learning environment has proven to be effective and easily adaptable to evolving clinical topics. Disseminating and incorporating simulation as part of other training programs at UCSF has already begun. An overview of the 10ICC ECMO course was also presented at a national conferenceLessons Learned: During the project, we discovered that debriefing was a key element to the learning experience. Experiences were enhanced through comments of the participants and observations from those in the viewing room. There is little published about the use of simulation in ECMO for RN training, so planning for future sessions will include how to best evaluate the effectiveness of simulation learning with advanced therapies such as ECMO/ECLS. For over 15years, nurses in10ICC have attended aneight (8)hour didactic course plus water drill prepared them tocare forextracorporeal membrane oxygenation or lifesupport (ECMO/ECLS) patients .Typically nurses were assigned toapatient on ECMO/ECLS along with asenior nurse for several shifts after the course .Though this provided adequate support, the UCSF Intensive Cardiac Care Unit Education Council felt more could bedone tohelp nurses integrate new knowledge and skills ina practical way.Asaresult, the Education Council collaborated with various healthcare professionals tobuild asimulation learning environment fortheir nurses training tocare forECMO/ECLS patients . 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Bridging the Gap Between Classroom & Bedside: Simulation in ECMO Training Intensive Cardiac Care Council Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Engaging key stakeholders was critical toimplementing asimulation based learning environment. Getting clinical experts inECMO therapy for content, stimulation specialists and clinical nurse educators fortraining tips, inaddition toformer nurse trainees forgap analysis and managerial support were crucial togiving new ECMO/ECLS nurses asolid foundation. Scripts were developed tohelp guide new nurses training toECMO/ECLS .Typical simulation training environments will consist ofbeginning with patient handoff report and the learners progressing through four main scenarios. Toenhance learning opportunities, learners will switch pairs after each segment .The mannequin and monitors will change aspart ofscript and tohelp facilitate with learning. ECMO/ECLS Device10ICC Nurses in Simulation Lab Simulation Viewing Room Example: Simulation Script Upon completion of the simulation training, feedback was incredibly positive . Nurses gained confidence integrating complex assessments and dynamic information in a safe learning environment .Further evaluation ofthe simulation program revealed that teamwork not only improved inthe simulation sessions butback ontheunit. The success oftheECMO/ECLS simulation classes furthered empowered nursing council members and staff members towards creating other advance training sessions tomeet theneeds oftheunit.

Unfortunately, thepatient's course often include aggressive mechanical and chemical treatments that leave the patient profoundly physically debilitated and psychologically depleted . Many nurses have reported feelings of sorrow, being emotionally drained and burned out after caring for these critical patients, resulting inlow staff morale . Furthermore, 10ICC nurses see these Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) patients at thelowest point intheir hospital course and rarely gettowitness the vast improvements these patients undergo .There iscurrently no mechanism tocommunicate to10ICC nurses that these patients areimproving, becoming autonomous and going home back totheir families. Inaneffort toimprove staff morale and engagement in 10ICC, an interprofessional collaboration with theMCS Team was coordinated to develop a newsletter tocommunicate patient success stories after being hospitalized atUCSF .Upon completion and production ofthefirst issue ofVAD Chronicles, feedback was incredibly positive . Nurses and healthcare providers were extremely excited toread the newsletter and see how prior patients were doing after their implantation/hospitalization .One patient inparticular leftapowerful message tothehealthcare providers atUCSF that leftmany 10ICC staff astounded. \"Continue doing what you are doing. Get them up even when they can't. Push them a little harder each and every day. Don't give up on us, even when we have given up. We'll bounce back, it just took me a little longer, but I am grateful for it. So, keep doing what you are doing. We really do appreciate it.\" Messages and stories such asthese are powerful tools towards improving staff morale and engagement in10ICC.

To test strategies educating patients regarding early symptom recognition and Accessing Appropriate Levels of Care. To better understand patients' experience of the ED and how this influenced their decision of where to access care. Next Steps : Expand the process to all patients being enrolled in the Care Support Program. Dissemination : Clear reduction in utilization was shown with verbal education on early symptom recognition, accessing appropriate levels of care with teach-back, and local urgent care facilities; and provision of \"When to Call the Doctor\" flyer and refrigerator magnet. This strategy has the potential for further dissemination and testing in other OPHAC clinical programs who also care for these high risk patients. Lessons Learned : In general, patients reported feeling well cared- for and having a good experience in the ED/hospital, so they did not perceive it as a place to avoid. Education on \"early symptom recognition\" and \"accessing appropriate levels of care\" was new information for most of the patients in our pilot population and likely reflects the patient population at large.Patient education provided by case managers has been shown to reduce ED usage among high risk patients who are frequent utilizers of the emergency department. Inappropriate ED usage can be attributed in part to lack of information about health care options available should patients have an urgent medical need. Many patients are unaware of 24 hour access to their primary care office or that after hours or weekend urgent care facilities exist. Studies suggest that an array of patient messaging strategies meant to reduce avoidable ED visits were shown to have potential impact on reducing inappropriate ED usage. Messages emphasizing wait time and stress inherent in ED visits were particularly effective. * as of April 30, 2018 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Innovations in Accessing Appropriate Levels of Care Care Support Health Complexity Team Anne Thibault, NP Lisa Sapiro, LCSW Martha Bianconi, HCN Mackenzie Clark, PharmD Seth Robbins, MD Robin Andersen, NP Christine Ritchie, MD Office of Population Health Background Pilot Project Plan Activities Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned The brochure reinforces that medical advice is available 24/7 and provides contact information for the patient's Primary Care clinic and UCSF Screening and Acute Care clinic. Patients were also provided with a personalized list of urgent care centers that accept their insurance. Both documents were provided to patients during the initial Care Support home visit. Patients received these documents in a plastic sleeve with a magnetic clip to allow the information to be displayed on their home refrigerators for easy access. Patients were asked to reflect on their experience in the ED in the initial Care Support NP Assessment and in subsequent Transitions of Care calls made by Health Care Navigators after ED visits. Of the 17 patients in the pilot project, there was an 80% reduction in ED use in the 6 months subsequent to the intervention compared to the 6 months prior. * Most patients were not aware of: Available telephone medical advice 24/7 Primary care clinics have on-call doctors working after hours Same day clinic appointments Available urgent care center options Care Support piloted a messaging strategy focused on Accessing Appropriate Levels of Care. Care Support NPs provided patients with a brochure and employed teach back about early symptom recognition and when and how to access care. Primary Intervention 11Problem: High risk populations, even after enrollment into complex care programs, disproportionately use higher levels of care. Goal: To incorporate utilization review processes into ICC with objectives of conducting root cause analysis, capturing ACSCs, determining avoidability (at a care team or system level), and recommending interventions to the care team, the Primary Care Provider, and/or Health System. Next Steps: Develop standardized data management processes to ease ability to gather and analyze pertinent data Explore interventions to improve early symptom recognition and self- management of chronic conditions Explore and test processes to improve patient access to appropriate level of care Dissemination:Continue to refine ICC format as patient populations and program structure continue to change to accommodate the system's growing needs Lessons Learned: Top reasons for utilization are not ACSCs but rather pain related (abdominal, chest, etc.) Clinical observations: difficulty documenting utilization outside of UCSF in medical record Systems changes may assist to address low health literacy -poor understanding of disease state and expected symptomsThe Care Support Program leverages key aspects of complex care models to support and care for the most vulnerable patients with medically and psychosocially complex issues, who tend to be high utilizers of costly health system services. Patients eligible for complex care services include: Age 18 years or older with 4 chronic conditions (Diabetes or Heart Failure, asthma , COPD, depression, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension or cardiovascular disease) High utilization patterns as defined by 2 inpatient stays or 3 ED/observation visits within the past 6 months Patients who are represented in an ACO partnership Sentinel events such as hospitalizations and ED visits offer opportunities for team/systems improvement.

Next Steps:Expand clinical resources of Cardiology trained nursing staff to screen and monitor patients with pacemakers/ICD implants during MRI. Dissemination: Through the MRI safety committee and other networks, share practice standards with UC campuses, ZSFGH and the community. Lessons Learned and Opportunities: Currently, these scans are primarily done in the 1.5 Tesla scanner, so the opportunity would be to be able to scan patients with pacemakers in higher Tesla scanners in the future. Currently non -conditional pacemakers are not FDA approved, so the opportunity will be to safely scan these patients monitored by trained nurses.In the past, MRI was contraindicated in all patients with implantable cardiac devices because of concerns that the powerful magnetic and radiofrequency fields generated during the MRI might cause heating in the area of the device, damage to the device or inhibit pacemaker/ICD function. There are risks associated with MRI for patients who have a pacemaker/ICD which are Non-MRI conditional and are not approved by the FDA for MRI scanning. Last year, UCSF Radiology, lead by Dr. M. Hope in partnership with Cardiology, lead by Dr. E. Gerstenfeld developed a workflow to safely image patients in MRI 1.5 T with selected pacemakers/ICDs. There have been no untoward events so far after imaging 215 patients in MRI since 2015. UCSF is currently the primary facility in the Bay Area providing MRI imaging for pacemaker patients and the volume of completed exams have increased 80% since 2016. There is sizable back log of patients with pacemaker needing MRI. Limitations are due to the volume of patients with non- conditional pacemakers/ICDs and the availability of Cardiology EP or nurse to monitor these patients during the MRI. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Imaging Patients with Pacemakers/ICDs in MRI Name Dr. Michael Hope, chair MRI Safety: Dr. Edward Gerstenfeld, Chief, Cardiac electrophysiology; Ben Mow, chief MRI technologist, Devin Dixon, MRI supervisor, Charlene Fong, RN. Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Based on current evidence and research , MRI can be performed in patients with a conditional and non- MRI conditional pacemaker in a 1.5 tesla MRI scanner. A physician or nurse with training is in attendance to monitor the patient during the MRI. Radiology and Cardiology developed a two part screening to ensure that the patient can be safely imaged in MRI. Cardiology screens the patient for appropriateness , performs device interrogation and programming for the MRI. After the MRI, baseline setting are restored. Radiology staff also screens the patient for MRI safety, and during imaging the MRI technologist follows the manufacturer imaging guidelines to minimize the potential for thermal heating. 13-Quantitatively and qualitatively describe LEP patient communication with front desk staff and MAs during the primary care visit. -Elicit the opinions of front desk staff, MAs, and MDs on how we can improve primary care delivery for patients with LEP . -Provide information and recommendations to the DGIM LEAN Transformation team, as we actively make changes to the way we deliver primary care. -After DGIM LEAN Access and Flow Kaizens are complete, we will reassess communication with LEP patients via qualitative, semi- structured interviews with front desk staff, MAs, and MDs.Next Steps: -Findings presented to the DGIM LEAN Transformation team for the Access Kaizen -Key recommendations: -Consider longer appointment times for interpreted visits -Increasing Open Access visits does not serve patients with LEP -Leveling schedules (i.e. evening out the number of providers for any given half- day) will help with front desk staff and MA work flow. This may lead to increased interpreter use. -Planning to present to the DGIM LEAN Transformation team for the Flow Kaizen Lessons Learned: Almost 25% of patients with LEP cannot adequately communicate with front desk staff and MAs because they are using limited English to communicate. Professional interpreter use by front desk staff and MAs is minimal, and time is seen as the major barrier. Tasks left undone by the front desk and MAs then fall to the MD to complete, adding time and stress to these visits.Primary care delivery is transforming, and increasingly important visit tasks are being completed by front desk staff and medical assistants (MAs). At UCSF's DGIM, approximately 11% of active panel patients have Limited English Proficiency (LEP), and approximately 18% of scheduled clinic visits are for patients with LEP . Little is known about how patients with LEP communicate with front desk staff and MAs during a primary care visit. As we move forward with DGIM's LEAN Transformation, it is important to understand the communication (or lack thereof) that is taking place during these parts of the visit for this vulnerable population. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Improving communication for patients with Limited English Proficiency throughout the primary care visit: focusing on communication with ancillary staff Lily Kornbluth, MD Leah Karliner, MD, MAS Division of General Internal Medicine (DGIM) Background Project Plan Project Goals Project Evaluation Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned 1)Analyze Language Access Systems Intervention (LASI) data related to front desk/MA communication -733 Spanish, Cantonese, and Mandarin- speaking DGIM patients interviewed 1 week after a PCP visit -Use these data to quantitatively describe the LEP patient experience with front desk staff and MAs 2) Semi -structured interviews with front desk staff, MAs, and MDs at 1545 Divisadero primary care practice -Understand the breadth of front desk staff and MA tasks that involve communication with the patient -Describe patterns of professional interpreter use amongst front d esk staff and MAs -Understand barriers to using a professional interpreter for front desk staff and MAs -Understand different practice patterns of MDs when working with LEP vs English- speaking patients -Elicit suggestions from front desk staff, MAs, and MDs about how the clinic can improve communication for patients with LEP 3) Present findings and recommendations to the DGIM LEAN Transformation team -Influence ongoing clinic delivery changes Patient language preference for scheduled visits Non-English English18% 82%Patient report of communication with front desk staff and MAs during the primary care visit (LASI data)Self-rating of English proficiency for patients with LEP using English with front desk staff and MAs (LASI data) Semi -structured interviews with front desk staff: \"It's easier to go find another staff member who speaks the language than to dial the phone interpreter.

Educate patients about expectations on the day of biopsy and concerning signs and symptoms after the procedure. Notify providers about patients who are not ready for their procedure and those who report concerning symptoms. Increase patient satisfaction with care and communication at the Urologic Surgical Oncology Clinic at Mission Bay.Next Steps Gather feedback from clinic staff and patients to determine if any messages need to be modified. Compare patient adherence, cancellation, and 30- day hospital admission between a cohort of patients who have used the text program for two months, and a retrospective cohort. DisseminationWe are developing programs for patients undergoing surgery for prostate and bladder cancer. Lessons LearnedInput from a variety of people in the care team is essential to identify areas where patient - provider communication can be improved. Education programs should match the language, health, and technology literacies of patients .Adequate patient preparation before procedures ensures patient safety and can enhance recovery. Access to mobile technology presents an opportunity to improve patient -provider communication before and after procedures . Currently, patient preparation for prostate biopsy involves detailed print material, in- clinic patient education, and phone calls to patients to remind them of key dates and information. However, patients sometimes struggle with adhering to verbal and paper- based instructions, resulting in cancelled appointments, incomplete preparation, avoidable delay to patients, and costs to the healthcare system. Evidence shows that text message reminders improve patient adherence and attendance to clinical appointments . , The use of this efficient and accessible technology to help patients prepare for procedures is a rapidly growing area of research and development. Communication PlatformMany of our urology patients are elderly and may have difficulty with new technologies. Therefore, we avoided app-based interventions. We worked with Medumo , Inc. to design an SMS -based intervention with short reminders containing links to web- based content. The program does not require downloading or logging into an application.

To deploy an inpatient CE protocol involving 2L PEG the night before and Simethicone the morning of an examination. To characterize and iteratively enhance protocol performance via the PDSA framework in conjunction with other stakeholders.Capsule endoscopy is a first -line and indispensable modality for examination of small bowel pathology in the inpatient setting, most commonly overt obscure bleeding. Quality is variable but at least partially modifiable via published and validated protocols. We propose to benchmark and iteratively improve CE quality using the PDSA framework in conjunction with other stakeholders. These measures may contribute to improved patient outcomes and hospital resource utilization.Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is an effective diagnostic modality for variety of conditions including obscure GI bleeding and small bowel tumors. The quality of inpatient CE is variable and often suboptimal. Poor exams contribute to an increase in hospitalization costs, length of stay, delays in definitive treatment and overall comorbidity. Although many risk factors are intrinsic to the patient population and examination setting, others are readily modifiable. Many published protocols have been shown to improve exam quality in a low cost and safe way. However, they have not been widely adopted by practitioners at UCSF. We propose to 1) benchmark the current quality of inpatient current CE and 2) iteratively test a variety of protocols using a \"Plan- Do-Study- Act\" (PDSA) framework.We will review a sample of the electronic health records of all patients undergoing CE at UCSF in 2016. Each chart will be queried for patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities), bowel preparation, completion rate, frequency of repeat/subsequent diagnostic studies, length of stay, transfusion requirements. We will review the CE images and report corresponding to these patients to assess VQ, CR, and DY. To assess VQ we will assess three 1 minute samples corresponding to the each small bowel segment according to published metrics (see Fig. 1). From the above analysis we will deploy sequential PDSA cycles beginning with one utilizing a 2L PEG/simethicone bowel preparation. Each PDSA cycle will focus on mitigation of one identified barrier through inpatient order sets, housestaff education, and capsule instructions note. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Improving Inpatient Capsule Endoscopy GI Endoscopy Methods ConclusionsCapsule Endoscopy (CE) is a valuable study for a wide variety of indications related to small bowel disease. In the inpatient setting, it is commonly used for the diagnosis of overt obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. 1It is considered superior to enteroscopy and radiography with a mean yield of 60% in several studies.2-4 The variation in detection rate primarily depends on the velocity of the capsule in the small bowel and the background color of the small bowel, which depends primarily on the quality of bowel preparation. 5 Although early protocols recommended a 12- hour fast prior to examination,6subsequent randomized control trials have demonstrated that a 2L polyethylene glycol (PEG) bowel preparation the night before improves visual quality (VQ, Figure 1), diagnostic yield (DY) and completion rate (CR).7 Simethicone, an anti -foaming agent, has been shown to improve VQ without improving the diagnostic yield or completion rate.7,8Pro-kinetic agents have not been shown to improve VQ, DY or CR in meta- analysis.7 A.Excellent: perfect visualization in every small bowel segments B.Good: > 75% of the mucosa in perfect condition, with some fluid or debris remaining C.Fair: 50% -75% of clean mucosa, with the presence of enough fluid, bubbles or debris to preclude a completely reliable examination D.Poor: < 50% of clean mucosa.

Shared Leadership driven initiatives in the ambulatory setting to implement change leads to improved staff retention and increased staff satisfaction. Preliminary review of patient satisfaction scores has seen increase in trend. An implications of this presentation is to encourage other ambulatory units to adopt shared leadership structure to improve staff engagement throughout UCSF ambulatory servicesThe PBC shared leadership group, also called the Dream Committee, consists of the PBC staff (RN and coordinators). The group was formed to address growth opportunities in the department as a result of the 2017 GALLUP survey feedback. The group was conceptualized to promote camaraderie and improve relationship and communication between staff members.DREAM stands for: Dedication, Recognition, Encouragement, Ambition, Morale.

Decrease delirium days per 1000 patient days by 5% and decrease average LOS by 3% by June 2018.Hospital -acquired delirium is serious, leading to increased falls, pressure ulcers, length of stay (LOS), cost, patient institutionalization, and patient and caregiver distress. In addition, hospital- acquired delirium is associated with mortality rates as high as 35-40% within one year in geriatric patients. Because hospital- acquired delirium is often under- recognized and prevention and treatment involves multi- disciplinary care coordination, comprehensive programs to decrease delirium are often lacking. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Got Delirium? Implementation of a Multi-Disciplinary Delirium Reduction Pathway Across UCSF Health Catherine Lau MD, Brian Holt MHA, Jan Yeager MDes, Jessica Chao PharmD MBA, Teresa Fong MBA, Judy Maselli MSPH, Megan Rathfon NP, Vanja Douglas MD, Stephanie Rogers MD Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned A team consisting of a geriatrician, hospitalist, neurologist, pharmacist, nurse practitioner, and service design experts created a comprehensive, evidence -based delirium care pathway with three components (Figure 1): 1) Screening 2) Prevention 3) Treatment The multi- disciplinary delirium reduction pathway was implemented in a step-wise fashion throughout the Health System starting in September 2016. Delirium reduction is a component of the Inpatient Age Friendly Health System Initiative, which is one of the UCSF Health Value Improvement initiatives for FY18. This initiative is also aligned with the UCSF internal medicine and general surgery residency quality improvement incentive goals for the 2017- 18 academic year. The creation of a comprehensive, multi -disciplinary delirium screening, prevention, and treatment pathway can lead to improved patient care and decreased LOS in patients who are at risk of delirium and who develop hospital -acquired delirium. Next Steps: Improve MD orderset compliance Investigate and pilot hardwiring delirium into daily standard work (e.g. inclusion of delirium in nursing STAT) Develop and pilot delirium audit tool similar to existing audit tools for patient harm Lessons Learned: Compelling data visualizations engage stakeholders and allow us to monitor and sustain success over time Proactively reach out and offer support to groups with low compliance has been well received and appears to be improving complia nceFigure 1: Delirium Care Pathway Delirium Day Reduction at UCSF 6 month rolling averageAs of March 2018, nursing compliance with AWOL screening is > 90%, compliance with Nu-DESC screening is > 85%, and provider activated delirium order set compliance is > 80% on the medicine service. Thus far, LOS in all patients with delirium decreased from 11.0 to 10.0 days. LOS of patients with delirium on the Acute Care for the Elderly (ACE) unit decreased from 13.0 to 11.4 days. 19Physicians based in academic health systems are often called upon to lead initiatives ranging broadly from quality and value improvement (QI) efforts to health services and outcomes research. These efforts are important for clinical operations as well as career and academic advancement. As academic medicine departments and divisions continue to grow in size, the challenge of supporting predominantly junior faculty to be successful in leading projects often requires access to a project mentor for methodologic design consultation, high- quality data, and project management support for implementation. However, clear mechanisms to facilitate and support this work are often lacking. To develop and implement a structured and supported system, leveraging existing resources where possible, to facilitate the ability of a growing hospital medicine division to conduct high-quality QI and research projects in an urban academic teaching hospital.Since the formal implementation of the project pathway in January 2017, there have been 49 separate project ideas submitted through the project pathway. Examples of submitted projects include: Pilot of a Molecular Medicine Consult Service, Albumin Utilization and Potential Reduction, and What Happened to my Patient: Developing Habits of Lifelong Learning through Patient Follow -Up. This has resulted in the submission of 21 abstracts to professional society conferences, 6 awarded intramural grants, and 3 research manuscripts submitted for publication. Over half of the submitted abstracts were first- authored by faculty at the clinical instructor or assistant professor level. In addition, the project pathway provides data and analytics on 4 divisional QI metrics that cannot otherwise be tracked using other existing administrative or clinical datasets. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Transforming Ideas Into Reality: A Structured Project Pathway to Facilitate QI and Academic Research Projects Catherine Lau MD Nader Najafi MD, James Harrison MPH PhD, Priya Prasad MPH PhD, Bradley Sharpe MD, Margaret Fang MD Division of Hospital Medicine Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned We aimed to integrate existing but separate affinity groups and resources within our Division into a more transparent, easier to navigate, centrally coordinated project pathway to support all faculty and staff. This required broad buy -in across divisional stakeholder groups such as QI, medical education, global health, health services research, data and clinical informatics, faculty development program, and the hospital medicine fellowship. We conceptualized the essential requirements of an integrated, structured, and supported project pathway into four domains: 1.Idea Generation: where project ideas from faculty, trainees, and staff are submitted into a centralized portal called the \"Project Tracker\" and regularly reviewed by the divisional Research and QI groups; 2.Methods / Design Consultation: where ideas are then refined through consultancy with experienced methodologists and, when appropriate, assigned a project mentor; 3.Data Acquisition / Analytics: where relevant data is obtained and analyzed; 4.Implementation and Dissemination: where divisional members can assist in project completion and help prepare abstracts and papers for presentation. Conceptual Design of a Project Pathway to Improve Hospital Medicine Academic Productivity The division supported infrastructure needed to coordinate the project pathway. This includes supplemental funding for research -oriented faculty to supervise the program and creation of a \"Data Core\", staffed by a clinician- informaticist and analyst. Implementation of a structured project pathway can: 1.Facilitate the transition from idea generation to project implementation. 2.Lead to enhanced availability of project resources for all faculty to contribute to academic productivity. 20Goals : 1. Reduce unnecessary radioactive isotope exposure by implementing a 1-day \"Low Dose Stress First\" (LDSF) protocol for patients who meet specific qualifications. -LDSF patients would receive 10 mCi of Tc -99 instead of the usual 24 mCi for stress imaging. -If there are abnormal stress findings, patients would proceed with resting images the same day by receiving 30 mCi of isotope after the stress images end. 2.Alleviate time constraints by potentially omitting resting images. -LDSF cases would not undergo resting images if stress images are normal (negative perfusion defects, no reduced LV ejection fraction, no left ventricular dilatation). Target Population : Patients from the ED/CDU (Clinical Decision Unit) and outpatients undergoing SPECT imaging who have low probability of needing resting images. They must meet the below criteria: No history of CAD/ MI / Heart transplant No history of Heart Failure, Cardiomyopathy , or reduced EF No LBBB or V -pacemaker BMI < 35 (patients with BMI > 35 require higher isotope doses for stress imaging to obtain adequate myocardial absorption) Target Thresholds: Minimum goal- perform 5 % of LDSF tests in eligible patients. Target goal -perform 7% of LDSF tests in qualified patients. Outstanding goal -perform 10% of LDSF exams in qualified patients. Analysis/Measurement: Daily assessment and report review of all MD finalized nuclear stress tests to decipher which LDSF cases required additional isotope for resting images. Next Steps: Modify the \"Low Dose Stress First\" (LDSF) criteria to include or exclude other patient populations. -Our data showed that patients with history of significant peripheral vascular disease or ESRD had a high likelihood of needing resting images. -71% of Pre-op Vascular Surgery and 44% of Pre-kidney Transplant cases had abnormal stress findings. -These groups may benefit from PET Rbstress tests, which utilizes Rubidium isotope and a PET camera for imaging. -The PET Rbstress test allows for a rest and stress exam to be completed within 60 minutes, but requires specific insurance authorization for outpatients. Expand the LDSF criteria to incorporate inpatients. -Utilizing the LDSF protocol for qualified inpatients may expedite their plan of care or discharge time, which contributes to less medical expenses. Dissemination : The Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) at Mission Bay has also initiated the LDSF protocol in their stress lab. They were able to add time slots for additional patients, which is what we plan to do once another SPECT camera is installed and remodeling is completed later this y ear. Lessons Learned : Interdepartmental collaboration was challenging with regards to communication and lack of access to each other's systems. -Unfortunately, we were unable to track total testing hours because patients departed from Nuclear Medicine without known time stamps. -Despite limited accuracy on test duration, we can infer that LDSF patients who did not require resting images most likely ende d their exam sooner than if they had proceeded with a regular \"Rest & Stress\" study. There were suggestions that all patients should be LDSF to reduce multiple protocols and improve staff compliance. -Staff was educated that patients who had high probability of obtaining resting images would receive a greater amount of radio active isotope ( 40 mCi total) than with a routine \"Rest & Stress\" exam ( 32 mCi total). We had also aimed to improve cost savings but lacked IT support in analyzing the financial impact. Although we could not pr ovethat there was a reduction in total testing time or medical expenses, our project showed that the majority of eligible patients were exposed to less radiat ionthrough the LDSF protocol. In the future, we hope to have the capabilities to address these other endpoints.Nuclear stress testing is utilized to evaluate for coronary artery disease (CAD) by injecting a radioactive isotope to image myocardial perfusion at rest and then again after stress (via exercise or pharmacologic dilatation). A SPECT camera is the most common image modality for nuclear stress testing. Resting isotope dose is 8 mCi of Tc-99, and stress dose is 24 mCi. The total amount of time for completing a rest and stress SPECT study may average 3 hours due to waiting for myocardial isotope absorption, imaging of the left ventricle, and processing for interpretation. The majority of patients without known cardiovascular disease have normal myocardial perfusion scans. These patients are receiving unnecessary radiation when they undergo an entire \"Rest and Stress\" exam. Some facilities practice a 2 -day \"Stress First\" protocol to decrease radiation exposure. Resting images are only required if stress images demonstrate abnormalities, but they must be completed another day due to lingering isotope from the stress dose. However, the 2- day \"Stress First\" protocol can be problematic for patients who live far away or noncompliant with follow- up. Newer studies and current guidelines support protocols utilizing a low isotope dose for stress imaging first in patients without high risk features. Resting images can still be completed afterwards on the same day if indicated. By implementing a 1- day \"Low Dose Stress First\" protocol, we may potentially reduce the total test duration and amount of isotope administered. Our project can positively impact the UCSF Health True North pillars in these categories: Patient Experience -Reduction in total testing hours may improve patient satisfaction and allow more time to commute/transfer to other appointments. Quality & Safety -Reduction in isotope dosage may decrease comorbidities/diseases caused by radiation exposure. Staff or personnel with close contact to the patient will also be exposed to less radiation. Financial Strength -Reduction in total testing time and isotope usage may increase cost savings to the Medical Center by allocating staff and resources more efficiently.

Hypothesis : Performing \"Low Dose Stress First\" (LDSF) nuclear SPECT tests in outpatients and ED/CDU patients that meet specific criteria will decrease the total amount of radioactive isotope exposure and potentially reduce total testing time. Interventions: Initiated the LDSF protocol in mid Sept 2017, but data was collected from October 2017 to March 2018. Conducted a meeting with Nuclear Medicine staff to decide LDSF criteria and discuss the new workflow . NPs screened outpatients 1 day before their scheduled tests to ascertain if they met LDSF criteria. ED/CDU patients were screened after test orders would appear in the work queue. Senior Nuclear Medicine tech would order the appropriate amount of isotope for the following day after communicating with the NPs. Doses could still be adjusted if there were changes to the protocol. Once the eligible patients completed their LDSF portion, a Nuclear Medicine physician would determine whether resting images were required. Common Barriers/ Root Causes: Communication -Not all staff (stress lab staff, schedulers, Nuclear Med techs) were aware of which patients warranted the LDSF protocol. -To improve this, we provided an algorithm and \"color dot\" system next to patient's name on the Apex schedule to indicate status. -We identified and printed out a schedule of LDSF patients to discuss in the morning huddles. Performing Provider -Not all eligible patients proceeded with LDSF if the performing provider deemed patient to be high risk. -Although this may lead to fewer LDSF studies, our data showed that 72% of LDSF cases were performed among patients who met cr iteria, which exceeded our outstanding goal of 10% performance rate. Nuclear Reader -42% of LDSF patients who had resting images showed abnormal findings. -There was inter-reader variability that accounted for additional resting images in some LDSF patients with normal stress repor ts. -It would be ideal to have a consistent reader or check for inter -rater reliability in the future. 051015202530# of Patients per Month Oct 2017 Nov 2017 Dec 2017 Jan 2018 Feb 2018 March 2018 Average 23 16 6Total ED/CDU & Outpatients eligible for \"LDSF\" SPECT protocol.

The multistep manual process also contributed to 1- 5 (non -patient -facing) errors annually. Improving the efficiency of creating the dashboard each month impacts the Quality and Safety and Financial Strength True North Pillars. GOAL:To automate the Asthma dashboard, reducing the amount of time needed to create the dashboard and eliminate human errors in decision making and calculation of metrics. TARGET STATE: Reduce the time needed to generate the dashboard every month from 6- 7 hours to <30 minutes. Reduce human errors by 100%. GAPS: Data reside in multiple, disparate sources, without a singular means for extracting all required elements .NEXT STEPS: We will continue to evaluate the ease of using the automated process each month and make necessary modifications. To completely automate it, we would like to - Schedule the creation of the Asthma Dashboard as one or more automated database jobs using a date trigger Develop a means for incorporating Physician feedback on individual cases without using email Deploy dashboard to Tableau server and allow for interactive functionality DISSEMINATION:Other dashboards within BCH -QI have been identified as benefiting from this automation framework. It could also be expanded to areas within and outside the Department of Quality, anywhere analysts are required to generate dashboards and reports that require Demographic data, Admission- Discharge - Transfer data, Vizient data, to name a few. LESSONS LEARNED: The availability of databases such as UCAll, Caboodle and Clarity offer a wide array of opportunities with process and task automation, within and outside the Department of Quality at UCSF Health. Significant challenges with use of data for automation include lack of a Central Data Warehouse and a Tableau Server.The Asthma Dashboard is an important tool for improving quality of Asthma care and patient safety. It monitors the following clinical outcomes: Use of Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) following discharge improves patient outcomes due to its efficacy suppressing airway inflammation. 30-day follow -up for pulmonary patients to confirm the reasons for recent exacerbation, adjust treatment, or provide more patient education. Length of Stay (LOS) to reduce unnecessary time spent in the hospital, thereby avoiding hospital- acquired conditions. Data from the Asthma Dashboard are also used to answer questions for the annual US News and World Report survey. PROJECT EVALUATION: We measured two outcomes: total time spent preparing the dashboard and number of data errors. PROJECT IMPACT: Removing waste led to a large reduction in the total time required for creating the dashboard each month, regardless of the number of identified Asthma discharge patients. The expected annual reduction in FTE hours required for creation and distribution of the Asthma dashboard is 74.4 hours. Workflow automationhas eliminated the need for manual decision making and calculations, thus eliminating human errors by 100% . 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Asthma Dashboard Automation Bilwa Buchake Noreenlou Goodlow ACE & BCH -QI Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Identifying the multiple, disparate sources from which the raw data in the Dashboard were housed was the biggest need. W e concluded that the required data could be pulled from databases available to the Department of Quality, such as Caboodle and UCAll. We also trialed developing the dashboard in Tableau instead of Excel, which would allow for greater interactivity. Our solution development workflow was as follows -1.Analyze data required for creating the dashboard 2.Identify underlying data sources from where these data could be gathered 3.Write SQL programs to gather data from identified data sources and store in a database 4.Create data integration and transformation solution for combining data from multiple data sources 5.Write SQL programs to aggregate data 6.Use Tableau for displaying and distributing the Asthma Dashboard The process map to the right shows the process post- intervention, as compared to pre -intervention (below, left), highlighting the reduction in unnecessary steps through automation.

These refinements were made in the setting of bi -weekly sub -committee meetings with a varied group of practitioners and staff: Across UCSF Primary Care, the main objective is to achieve the PRIME* screening goal: To achieve this goal, we have continuously created and tested PDSA cycles to drive: Effective and efficient provider communication workflows Streamlined clinic staff support workflows Provider engagement and collaboration with new treatment programs Patient engagement with screening and new treatment programs *PRIME patients = patients seen in Primary Care twice in a given measurement periodNext Steps: Looking ahead to FY19, we will further systematize depression screening at DGIM and UCSF Primary Care. Identified opportunities include:Greater inclusion of front line staff input to further refine processes to increase screening compliance Continuing to create and disseminate reports to ensure meaningful and actionable data reaches front line staff and administrators Leveraging the health maintenance banner for screening to create a more streamlined process that is integrated with other annual screeners Dissemination of screening best practices across Primary Care clinics Exploring the application of health technology to increase screening and patient engagement rates Expanding the Collaborative Care program to more patients and providers within DGIM Population Health: include the depression screening measure in the PRIME Primary Care Ambulatory Quality reports to achieve the same concerted improvement efforts as other primary care quality measures Lessons Learned: A number of key factors were instrumental in the wide spread adoption of depression screening. These factors include: Consistently engaged stakeholders and leadership Value of integrated mental health providers Ongoing development and refinement of reports relating to screening and data abstraction into Apex Strategic participation in varied communication channels (i.e. team meetings, daily huddles, newsletters, posters, staff trainings) In Sept. 2017, the Division of General Medicine (DGIM) at Mt. Zion implemented standard workflows for annual depression and suicide screening for all empaneled patients at one location. Screening with the PHQ -9 was implemented in response to the FY18 PRIME Behavioral Health measures, which incentivize the identification and treatment of depression within Primary Care. Project stakeholders elected to develop new EMR - based workflow tools to facilitate standardized screening, provider communication with clinical staff, and decision support resources ( SmartSets). DGIM has a diverse population of about 25,000 patients; this intervention was conducted on one floor of the DGIM clinical practice which serves about 16% of UCSF Primary Care patients (DGIM2). Initial screening outcomes one month post launch suggested a successful implementation: ~80 % of all patients who attended a DGIM appointment on the second floor had a PHQ9 entered into the Apex flowsheet. Efforts to screen at a high rate continued, as a new Collaborative Care program for depression treatment became more widely available to patients. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Implementing Annual Depression and Suicide Screening in Primary Care Kristin Gagliardi1, Hannah Rapp1, Jennifer Population Health & Accountable Care, 2Division of General Internal Medicine, 3Department of Psychiatry, 4Primary Care Services Background Project Plan and Intervention Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned In January 2017, a steering committee was created, consisting of leadership from the Office of Population Health & Accountable Care, the Department of Psychiatry, DGIM and Primary Care Services to identify an interdisciplinary team tasked with leading work groups to research and design screening workflows and a stepped care treatment model. In the months following, these workgroups consulted providers and front line staff to; design Apex workflow enhancement tools, create the analytical infrastructure to create a daily patient registry, and advocate for two new FTE, to support the anticipated increase in depression identification and patient need for mental health support given the new screening. BPA Alert for Providers Cadence Prompt for Front Desk Staff Patient Testimonial \"I was grateful that during an unrelated checkup with my primary care physician, I was presented with a depression questionnaire. When the nurse informed me that my response may result in a follow -up contact from an LCSW, I was very open to it.

Primary cost drivers are: surgery injections imaging prescriptions 25% of patients with spinal pain have significant physical limitations, resulting in $270 billion of indirect costs due to work absence. Back and neck pain are complex conditions. Once it becomes chronic it can be managed--but rarely cured. Psychological and social factors are more powerful predictors of outcome than imaging findings. Evidence- based care dictates an integrated, bio- psychosocial approach. Clinical pathways that emphasize this approach have shown decreased MRI utilization and surgery referrals, decreased direct and indirect costs, improved patient outcomes, and improved patient and physician satisfaction. Approximately 20,000 back and neck pain patients are treated per year at UCSF (75,000 separate encounters). Care for these patients is associated with high direct costs ($85M), a net loss (4.5M), and no improvement in patient a quality of life (PRO data from Ortho Spine Clinic). 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Integrated Spine Service Team Conor O'Neill , M.D., Director of Non -Operative Spine Service, Department of Orthopedics Mario DePinto ,M.D, Director of Pain Management Center, Department of Anesthesiology Nat Gleason , M.D., Medical Director for Practice Innovation, Faculty Practice Organization, & Division of General Internal Medicine faculty Catherine Lau, M.D., Director, Caring Wisely Stephen Baxter ,PT, MSc, DPT, Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science Matt Callahan , MBA, Analytics Program Manager, Department of Orthopedics Lowen Cattolico, PT, MS, OCS, Assistant Director Outpatient Services, Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Sarah Imershein , Value Improvement Manager, STIM Jessica Chao, PharmD, MBA, Director, Clinical Innovation Center Yoon-Ji Kim, Service Designer, Clinical Innovation Center Jan Yeager, Mdes, Service Designer, Clinical Innovation Center Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned The goal of the Integrated Spine Service is to demonstrate that a value- based multidisciplinary program for the treatment of back and neck pain -a Non- Operative Spine Service -which collaborates closely with Primary Care and Physical Therapy, will result in better outcomes (5% improvement in PROMIS 10), lower costs (10% reduction in direct costs), and an enhanced patient experience.

We exceeded our original financial goal of $1.5M by $2.4M for improved reimbursements. Documentation for patients on Malignant Hematology service does not always reflect severity of illness, risk of mortality, medical complexity and associated care during their inpatient hospitalization. Without related specificity in the documentation there is a negative affect to Case Mix index (CMI) and risk adjusted Quality outcome metrics such as Observed/Expected Mortality rankings (O/E) and Length of stay (LOS) index. Non Medicare cases fall into lower weighted DRGs and have a lower Case Mix Index for MH/BMT compared to the Medicare patients despite similar hospitalizations and clinical co -morbidities. The CDI team reviews Adult Malign Heme /BMT Medicare cases with positive outcomes on quality metrics and financial reimbursement. A CDI partnership with Malignant Hematology to accurately reflect severity of illness and medical complexity of all patients on MH/BMT service would improve Quality metrics & potential reimbursement. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Background Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned 2.135.36 0123456 Before CDI influence After CDI influenceCase Mix Index excluding Medicare Cases with DRG impact (n=135 cases) Jul 2017 -Mar 2018 MH Collaborative Partners: Oncologist: Rebecca Olin, MD & Hospitalist John Dzundza on strategies, goals, and data.

To reduce VQI abstraction time, effort, and missing VQI specific variables. To create EPIC data tools to assist in data collection more efficiently . To move data collection as close as possible to the procedure time.NEXT STEPS : Finish the last two templates for EVAR and TEVAR modules and design Long Term Follow up templates. Maintain, sustain, and update templates to match future changes required by the VQI Registry. DISSEMINATION : Continue to work with the Vascular Surgeons and orient new residents/ fellows to the VQI data collection process. LESSONS LEARNED: Data collection tools continues to evolve from using pen/paper to xls spreadsheets to Epic/EMR Templates. Key factors include building content of the templates without redundancy of data, utilizing a VQI data expert who also has an in depth knowledge of Epic documentation, and collaborating consistently with the IT team and the Vascular Surgery Department. The success of our new process using Epic/EMR is dependent upon the utilization of the VQI specific Brief Op Notes in a timely manner as close as possible to the procedure time. Understanding that improving clinical outcomes is only possible with complete, accurate, and timely data therefore, it is an imperative first step to implement structured op notes that are accessible at the point of care.The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) is a collaborative of regional quality groups collecting and analyzing data in an effort to improve patient care. The VQI collects perioperative and one- year follow update to generate real time benchmarked reports to assess quality of care and determine best practices in vascular surgery. going LIVE with the VQI templates in March 8, 2018, the time required to collect VQI surgical data decreased from 41 days (median) to 1 day. By having surgeons enter procedural data at the point of care, documentation is complete & accurate, decreasing the time & effort looking for missing VQI variables. PROJECT IMPACT:Although we just went LIVE with only 25 charts to evaluate from March 8 - April 8, 2018, the utilization of a structured VQI brief op note to capture clinical data at the point of care, significantly improved efficiency in the data collection process. The project eliminated misinterpretation of the op notes during chart reviews. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Improving Data Accuracy & Efficiency by Implementing VQI -specific Brief Op Notes Joyce Nacario , Soni (IT/Apex) Department of Quality -AQI Division of Vascular Surgery Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES: Create 8 structured, easy to use VQI specific Brief Op Notes in EPIC to capture complete VQI specific data more efficiently. Design discreet data fields for future data import automation. PROCESS: We acquired AC3 UCSF IT/Epic Leadership approval to design & build 8 VQI Brief Op Notes using standard Epic clinical documentation tool called the Smart Block. We streamlined the content so that the source of truth of existing data fields in EPIC/EMR are taken into account. Utilizing a structured customized template for each VQI module allows the surgeons to specifically choose the correct VQI procedure and appropriately select the answers that match the VQI registry definition and nomenclature. The 6 of 8 Vascular Surgery templates are LIVE (March 8, 2018) and each VQI Brief Op Note expands to a longer form dependent on the answers provided by the surgical fellows. Problem UCSF Health started with Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) in April 2015 with 4 modules and added 4 more modules in 2016. We have several ways of abstracting data from Epic by pulling into a report all discreet data such as demographics, lab values, history, imaging, etc but the specific details of the procedure are often the most difficult to find. We tried to capture missing data elements using an xls spreadsheet designed with a dropdown menu to align the answers with the registry. It takes up to 41 days (median) days lag time waiting for the forms to be emailed back to the data manager for VQI Registry submission. Documentation is done far behind from the time of procedure making accuracy and completeness of data a major challenge. MARCH 8 -APRIL 8, 2018 casesCarotid Endarterectomy board in the neuro -intensive care unit (NICU) their first night then transfer to the floor. These patients are clinically well, with uncomplicated post - operative courses and are anticipated to be discharged home post -operatively after two days. In FY 2015 the NICU was one of the most expensive units in Moffitt Long. A majority of the direct costs can be attributed to room and board. The neurosurgery team identified patient populations that can safely bypass the ICU to accommodate higher acuity patients and save costs. SAFE TRANISTIONS PATHWAY This project aims to reduce direct cost per case for eligible procedures by $5,526 from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018.The direct cost per case for FY17 for eligible procedures was $23,100/case. Our goal is to reduce it to $17,575/case for FY18. Other project goals include: Decreased post- operative length of stay Increased frontline nursing satisfaction Increased patient satisfaction by creating a more comfortable environment Increased availability of NICU beds to the communityNext Steps:Ongoing APeX buildsOngoing monitoring of safety and quality outcomesOngoing physician recruitment for programFollow -up nurse and patient surveys to ensure sustainability Dissemination:Identify additional patient populations suitable for pathway in both neurological surgery and other servicesPublish and present results nationally to help other institutions replicate model. Lessons Learned: Changing culture is slow and requires patience; this cannot be achieved without full nursing engagement. Clinical pathway improvements require the input and support of multiple disciplines and teams. Electronic medical record modification is not always possible. 2018 UCSF 3rdAnnual Improving Value Together Forum Safe Transitions Pathway in Neurological Surgery Jennifer Viner, NP Aldea Meary -Miller, MBA, MPH UCSF Department of Neurological Surgery, UCSF Center for Healthcare Value Background Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned 1.Patient population identification: new patient populations: Neuro -Transitional Care Unit (6 Long) Post -Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) Operating Room Nurses (OR)Neurosurgery Nurse Practitioners 3.Physician engagement: Workflow redesign to create program awareness Creation of dedicated order sets in APeX Nurse surveys to demonstrate competency 4.Patient preparedness: Ongoing patient experience surveysSurgical pathway pamphlet development POST - ANESTHESIA CARE UNITINTENSIVE CARE UNIT FLOOR UNITNEURO TRANSITIONAL CARE UNITEMERGENCY ROOM / TRANSFERS/CLINIC DISCHARGEOPERATING ROOM Patient Education Pamphlet Covers Since July 1 2017, 55 cases have gone through the Safe Transitions Pathway. -5 microvascular decompressions -11 chiari malformations -39 tumors In quarter one and two of fiscal year 2018, the difference in direct costs for cases going through the safe transitions pathway versus cases standard pathway cases eligible to go through was $4, 925.

Between January 2017 and September 2017, there was a quarterly average of 90 verbal orders for serum q uantitative hCG tests and 51 ABO/Rh typing tests. Between October 2017 and February 2018, RNs were not ordering labs via verbal orders, because RNs had been notified not to use this order mode for orders that were not urgent/emergent. Nurses were either messaging nurse practitioners on a case -by-case basis or pending orders for providers to authorize. Data from both of these methods were not available.Next Steps:Nurse Managers should continue to monitor use of verbal orders by utilizing the Order Mode Dashboard. The Order Mode Dashboard provides data on other orders that could potentially be non- provider protocols. Dissemination:These findings indicate that non- provider protocols could be used in other UCSF Health settings to potentially reduce the use of verbal orders that are not urgent/emergent. Lessons Learned: Effective use of non -provider protocols is associated with a decrease in the number of verbal orders for new patients needing serum quantitative hCG tests and ABO/Rh typing tests. Context:Health systems are examining processes, like verbal orders, to reduce errors, increase efficiency, and improve the quality of patient care. Verbal orders are orders from providers to registered nurses (RNs) either in- person or over the phone . Verbal orders allow for timely and efficient care , but can create risks due to potential for miscommunication . The Joint Commission requires health systems to minimize use of verbal orders that are not urgent/emergent. Current State:Between January -September 2017, ~ 100% of serum quantitative hCG tests and ABO/Rh typing tests were verbal orders in the Women's Health OBGYN Ambulatory Practice. This process improvement project examined how use of non- provider protocols can affect the number of verbal orders taken by the RNs when responding to telephone and electronic messaging triage for new patients. True North Pillar Impact:Patient Experience: Decreasing verbal orders can improve the patient experience by improving timeliness and consistency of care. Quality & Safety: Non- provider protocols facilitate standardized practice and are evidence -based. Our People: Non- provider protocols increase RN and provider satisfaction by allowing RNs to work at top -of-license; improved satisfaction can impact turnover rates. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Use of Non-Provider Protocols to Decrease Verbal Orders Ambulatory Clinical Services Women's Health OBGYN Ambulatory Practice Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Figure 1 shows implementation plan for instituting non- provider protocols. The data collection period focused on an RN training session and establishing SmartPhrases to correspond with the non- provider protocols. SmartPhrases were used to validate and document that RNs asked patients the appropriate questions to order the lab tests (refer to Figure 2 for example). Figure 2: ABO/Rh Typing Test SmartPhrase There was a greater than 50% decrease in verbal orders and an increase in use of non-provider protocol orders between January 2017 and April 2018. After September 2017, there was a significant decline in the number of verbal orders. Use of non-provider protocol orders increased after March 12, 2018. Between March 12, 2018 and April 6, 2018, there was 1 verbal order and 37 protocol orders. A comparison of the data from the same 4- week periods in 2017 and 2018 provides a contrast between before and after implementation of non-provider protocols. While the orders clearly shifted from verbal to non- provider protocol, the volume of orders are different between the 4 - week period. It is unclear whether this variation is due to changes in actual orders or if there are missing data. *ABO/Rh Typing Test = Prenatal Type and Screen 29Baseline : no measurement of staff satisfaction (anecdotal RN dissatisfaction only), no formal CM partnerships or escalation workflows Goal : improve staff satisfaction with CTOP/CM communication process; we also wanted to design & implement a formal CTOP CM escalation procedure Target : increase CTOP RN satisfaction from 2.4/5.0 to 3.0/5.0; any increase in CM satisfaction (from 3/5); completed escalation process Barriers Identified by CTOP : Coordinating Care but not Case Managers Trying to identify and solve problems without training Playing Middle Man 5 calls to address one case Respecting Relationships CMs and HHA Liaisons Dispersing Knowledge of Issues CMs who did the work knowing when it broke down UCSF system issues versus agency -specific issuesNext Steps: As OPHAC & CM increase collaboration, it will be important to understand how to maintain and optimize the work experience of both divisions. Additional shadowing opportunities, presentations, & standard processes may be used to keep silos at bay. Dissemination:Simple interventions such as job shadowing and presenting at team meetings can have significant impact on staff satisfaction and communication. These interventions could apply to other siloed teams across UCSF. Lessons Learned: The patient was the bridge between the silos. The turning point in CTOP's presentation to CM was telling a real patient story. It demonstrated all the work CTOP does and where the two teams intersect. It also illustrated barriers to care identified by CTOP , despite CM work completion. There are always factors beyond the control of the inpatient teams, and that reinforces the importance of CTOP's safety net. Additionally, increased understanding of scope/roles of each team improved quality of staff interactions.Our People: Creating an Optimal Work Experience CTOP has been expanding and improving since September, 2013, and has formal escalation processes with School of Pharmacy to resolve complex medication/Rx issues and the Patient Relations Department to address satisfaction concerns. Barriers to receiving home health services are addressed by CTOP RNs on post -discharge calls. As of November, 2017, CTOP did not have a formal escalation process with Case Management (CM) to resolve complex home health issues. The CTOP and CM silos created inefficiencies and lack of understanding, which in turn resulted in staff dissatisfaction. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Care Transitions Outreach Program & Adult Case Management M.

We are interpreting these data as an indication that staff are more satisfied, and thus our intervention was successful.Through an anonymous online survey, communicated to staff via email and during team meetings, we asked each team to rate their experience in communicating with the other. < We saw a slight increase in the response rates of both teams, meaning more staff were willing to take the time to complete the survey after our intervention than before.Bridging Silos Improving Work Experience & Efficiency of Care Pre-Survey Nov, 2017CTOP RNs Shadow CMs Nov, 2017CTOP Present @ CM Staff Meeting Dec, 2017Escalation Process Created Dec, 2017Process in Practice Dec, 2017 - May, 2018Post - Survey May, 2018 CTOP CM 30To determine the pattern and factors associated with kidney stone patients traveling to undergo ureteroscopy (URS), shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), their county for 61,679 (17.3%) Mean distance traveled: 70 miles (112 km) SWL was associated with a decreased likelihood of travel independent of age, race, gender, and payer group (p < 0.01 for all). URS and PCNL were not associated with travel out of the patient's county. Independent of procedure type, and controlling for the number of urologists, having private insurance or Medicare was associated with travel within (p < 0.001; OR 11.4) and out of a region (p=0.008; OR = 2.67). Non -white race was negatively associated with travel within (p <0.001; OR 0.07) or out of (p=0.034; OR = 0.45) a region. Overall, patients tended to travel from areas with few urologists to areas with many urologists and rarely travel great distance (Figure). 62.2% of counties in the United States have no practicing urologists. 89.3% of urologists practice in metropolitan areas. 3 main procedures for treating kidney stones: 1.

Allow timely medication and therapy administration.Quality and Safety : Reduce radiation exposure from confirmatory CXR and reduce delay in initiation of infusion therapies. Financial Strength: Reduce cost of care by eliminating unnecessary confirmatory CXRs in adult patients who require bedside PICC placements by the Vascular Access Support Team (VAST ).Conclusions Since the implementation of ECG TCS in December 2017, there is a significant decrease in confirmatory CXRs. Consequently, there is a reduction of time from line insertions to placement confirmations or when lines are released for use. The monthly operational cost for PICC confirmatory CXRs pre- ECG TCS approximated at $30,000. Initial implementation suggested a 80% reduction in confirmatory CXRs in PICC placement equivalent to about $24,000 savings in CXRs cost per month. In summary, ECG TCS improves cost of care, timeliness of infusion therapy and patient safety by reducing radiation exposure and accuracy of PICC placement at the bedside.The ECG Tip Confirmation System (TCS) is an alternate FDA approved methodology in confirming new peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) replacing the need for post PICC insertion chest radiographs (CXR). 1 Confirmation of tip location by post procedure CXR is less accurate and while acceptable, a less preferred method than real time electrocardiogram in isolating the cavoatrial junction (CAJ). 2 Tip confirmation by CXR is costly, causes delays in treatment and medication therapies and exposes patients to unnecessary radiation. 3Over 800 PICC placements achieved 97% accuracy using ECG TCS technology. Since implementation of ECG TCS with elimination of confirmatory CXR: -80% reduction of confirmatory CXRs related to PICC placements -85% reduction of time between PICC insertion to placement confirmation 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Elimination of Chest Radiographs with Electrocardiogram Tip Confirmation System for Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters Vivian Phan, RN, Elizabeth Sin, RN, MS, CCRN Vascular Access Support Team Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned 1.

Background Project Plan and Interventions To improve blood pressure management for African American patients within DGIM: Understand patient preferences for blood pressure control. Test multiple pilot interventions based on patient preferences and existing evidence, assessing acceptability, feasibility, and scalability along the way. Specific goal of a 10% reduction in the disparity between blood pressure control between African American and White patients, which correlates to an absolute improvement of 1.3%.

The ultimate goal of this project is to decrease opioid over- prescription by identifying patient and surgery characteristics that are associated with over- prescription. Several types of ambulatory surgery are performed at MZ: breast, OHNS, plastics, endocrine, gynecology Data on the opioid prescription practices of each subspecialty will be analyzed The focus of this report is on breast surgeryThe vast majority of patients undergoing outpatient breast surgery were prescribed opioids (92%). Of those who received prescriptions, 40% never used any and only 21% used beyond 5 days. Of those who had stopped taking opioids at the time of phone follow -up, the average total number of pills consumed was 1.9 \u00b1 5.5, which was similar to that of the general study population (2.3 \u00b1 5.2, p = 0.15). Almost all patients (96%) reported general satisfaction with their pain control. This, in combination with the percentage of patients who do not require opioids for postoperative analgesia, suggests that opioid prescription for ambulatory breast surgery can be reduced, especially if non- opioid analgesic adjuncts are utilized beyond current practices. This data will be presented to the Mount Zion ambulatory breast surgical service. Knowledge of the opioid usage patterns for their patient population along with encouragement of use of non- opioid and non- pharmacologic measures will hopefully decrease opioid prescriptions while maintaining high patient satisfaction scores. In addition, development of venues for patients to properly dispose of unused opioids will be an ongoing collaborative effort as current proper disposal rates are low. Opioid abuse remains a major public health crisis in the United States despite awareness of the epidemic for the past 2 decades. Complications from opioid abuse remain high. According to the CDC, opioids were involved in 42,249 deaths in 2016 and the number of deaths from opioids was five times higher in 2016 than 1999. Both prescription and non- prescription opioids play a role in the epidemic. Studies have shown that opioids are frequently over- prescribed in the postoperative period and that initial prescription patterns by providers are associated with long- term risks of chronic opioid use. Additionally, if unused, excess opioid pills may be stored and eventually diverted for non-medical use. The UCSF Mount Zion Surgery Center is an ambulatory surgical center where the majority of patients are sent home with opioid prescriptions for postoperative analgesia. The general approach to postoperative pain management and opioid prescription practices varies amongst surgical services and from provider to provider. There are also variable practices in utilization of non- opioid analgesics such as NSAIDs and gabapentinoids. Furthermore, there currently is no follow -up for patients to properly dispose of pills that go unused. Breast surgeries accounted for 25.8% of all patients surveyed (72/279). The type of breast surgeries performed included axillary node dissection, breast biopsy, and variable degrees of mastectomy (total, partial, unilateral, bilateral) with or without BSO. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Optimizing opioid prescription practices for ambulatory breast surgery Jane Yu, MD Azul Galvez John Feiner, MD Christina Inglis -Arkell, MD Department of Anesthesiology Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned All patients who underwent ambulatory surgery at Mount Zion received a follow -up phone call on POD 5 to inquire about their pain control and analgesic medications use. Patients were asked the following questions: On a scale of 0- 10, what is your current pain score at site of surgical procedure? Would you describe your pain as mild, moderate, severe, or none at all? Is the level of pain what you expected it to be?Were you prescribed opioid pills for pain after your surgery? Are you still taking them? When did you stop taking them? How many pills did you take or have taken so far? What are your plans with the leftover pills or do you think you will finish the bottle? Are you satisfied with the way your pain is controlled?Are you satisfied with your pain control educationAre you taking non -opioid pain medications? Have you received any information from your care team about the use of non -opioid pain medication? Have you received any information from your care team about the use of pain control methods that don't involve medication? Data was obtained from September to December 2017 and was analyzed according to type of surgical subspecialty. 34To describe strategies to recruit and then support members from diverse and vulnerable communities on hospital- based PFACs. Hospital leaders should venture into the communities that they seek to recruit PFAC members from. Examples include outreach at community health centers, or clinics, and using social media. PFACs should be operationalized to support the inclusion of diverse members though the use of interpreters and team activities that build cohesion between PFAC members and leaders . Our study has identified a number of recruitment methods to increase the diversity of hospital- based PFACs and approaches to ensure members from diverse communities can fully participate.Over 50% of acute care hospitals have Patient & Family Advisory Councils (PFACs) -UCSF has 13 Councils. PFAC members (patients, family members and caregivers) share their lived experiences of healthcare which can guide health system patient -centered care efforts. Ensuring PFACs have diverse membership are representative is a challenge. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Patient & Family Advisory Councils (PFACs): Recruiting and Supporting Members from Diverse Communities UCSF Division of Hospital Medicine James Harrison, Wendy Anderson, Maureen Fagan, Edmondo Robinson, Jeffrey Schnipper , Jim Banta, Chen, Jonathan Duong, Celene Wong, Andrew Auerbach Background Project Methods Project Goals Project Findings Discussion & Lessons Learned We formed a team comprising of patient advisors, researchers, physicians, nurses and quality improvement experts to guide this project. Nine Academic Medical Centers including UCSF took part in this project. We conducted eight focus groups and 19 individual interviews with 80 participants including 45 PFAC members, 12 PFAC leaders, 11 researchers and 12 hospital leaders. Focus group and interviews explored participants' experiences of recruiting and supporting diverse PFAC members. We analyzed data were using qualitative content analysis. Findings were organized into coding categories and included representative quotes. This project was funded by a Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) Eugene Washington Engagement Award (Harrison #3455) Figure 1: Recommendations for Recruiting Diverse PFAC Members Figure 2: Recommendations to support inclusion of diverse PFAC members1. Utilizing existing networks \"Some of my colleagues - unbeknownst to me at the time -had links formed with a socioeconomically disadvantaged tenancy group in Boston and we then conducted outreach programs with groups like that\" (Researcher) \"I think that some avenues that might work would be... patients that have already been recruited for other research studies. They at least have shown some interest in being involved, and that might be the entry to approaching them again\" (PFAC Member)2. Going out into communities \"Taking a page out of the playbook of community - based participatory research might be a good thing. So trying to go to communities where there may be connections...that could be a launching pad for connecting with people who could be on the PFAC.\" (Hospital Leader) \"It might be worthwhile to meet with members of the community health centers... especially to have them reach out to the population that you're trying to recruit....they're a wealth of knowledge\" (Researcher)3. Recruiting from outpatient clinics \"If you've got contacts with primary care clinics in certain parts of cities that serve disadvantaged groups... we've sent someone out to speak to the primary care providers who can then act as almost like a go -between with their patients to try and draw people in\" (Researcher) \"We have specialty clinics in the neighborhood health centers. So we were able to talk to patients from that group\" (Hospital Leader)4. Using social media for outreach \"We now use social media. We use a Facebook page to engage them. So it's coming up with those unique ways to meet them, what meets their needs\" (PFAC Member) 5. Setting transparent expectations \"I can tell you from our experience ...our patients and families like to see information up front. When we have information that needs to be reviewed, or patient education material, those types of things, they like to see it up front, prior to coming into a meeting...\" (PFAC Leader)3. Equalizing roles between community members and PFAC leaders \"They come in, and they sign in. Everyone signs in. And we have name tents so that everybody can be called by their first name... when we're in these councils, a physician can look at someone and say, \"Jane, what do you think about that?\" It's that community and the partnership\" (PFAC Leader) \"I think, as patients and caregivers, we think that the investigators or hospital staff are always going to be the experts, so it's, in a way, a top-down sort of relationship.... but I think it's really important to remember that researchers and hospital staff don't necessarily know how to engage patients and caregivers. I think it's a two way street, that we can all be respectful to one another\" (PFAC Member)2. Building community between PFAC members \"It solidifies a group, just like it does with our peers and our colleagues. So, how do we advance those relationships? We spend time together...\" (PFAC Member) \"They've asked us for very specific things, and one of the things they've asked us for is a document, with each of their pictures and a little background about them and contact information. Everyone agreed that they want to be in touch with each other, so they could actually call each other, even during the downtime. That was one thing they asked for\" (PFAC Leader)1. Using culturally appropriate communication \"So you have to be very sensitive to these things ...in terms of, are you addressing their core values and leveraging their core values in the language choice, the word choice, appropriate language and cultural expectations with those interaction\" (PFAC Leader) \"I think, sixty percent, their primary language is Spanish... we hired a Spanish- speaking Pharmacist who is a fully fluent Spanish -speaking. So we made sure that we never had to turn a patient down\" (Researcher)4. Having a diverse PFAC leadership team \"I think it's very important to reach people where they are. If you have someone in your leadership group- or two or three people in your group -that look like the population you're representing, it's much easier to reach them\" (Researcher) 35Investigate nurse practitioners (NPs) contribution to the healthcare system including healthcare teams and patient care. Assess how these activities are measured and documented. Identify how NP contributions operate in the context of value-based care. Literature on value related to nurse practitioner role examines value through the lens of cost and cost-savings, and in the context of practice and reimbursement policies (Naylor and Kurtzman, 2010). Traditional methods of assessing value are revenue generation by RVUs (relative value units) (Pickard, 2014). MACRA (Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act) is legislation designed to focus on quality, cost, and effective use of electronic health record systems (Mulvany, 2016). As healthcare institutions transition away from RVUs to value -based reimbursement under MACRA, it is timely to measure how NPs' roles on healthcare teams may influence MACRA metrics, and to investigate how contributions to value are documented and measured by institutions. Mulvany, C. (2016). MACRA: the Medicare physician payment system continues to evolve. Healthcare Financial Management, 70(2), 32-35. Naylor, M. D. & Kurtzman, E. T. (2010). The role of nurse practitioners in reinventing primary care. Health Affairs, 5(2010), 893-899. Pickard, T. (2014). Calculating your worth: understanding productivity and value. Journal of Advanced Practice Oncology, 5(2), 128-133. NPs conduct activities that may not directly generate revenue, however, still contribute to institutional and healthcare value. Some ways pediatric NPs perceive their contribution to patient care include teaching and communication. \"I think that because I have a foundation in nursing, my education for teaching patients how to do [treatment] is a different approach...\"\"... and sometimes I'll take extra time to really explain something regarding their [disease] or [treatment]. I feel like they go home really understanding this [disease]. Because if they go home not understanding when to use [treatment], that defeats the purpose of the whole visit.\" NPs coordinate care for patients and serve as an agent of continuity in their divisions. \"I think, at least in my particular position, too, there is that continuity piece that really, I think, is of value that maybe isn't appreciated. But when you're dealing somebody with a chronic condition, you need somebody that's going to be there kind of throughout that time period. And so I think the NP role lends itself to that continuity too.\"\"So all the providers in our practice will ask me to help with basically anything infusion- related or specialty medication related.\" NPs develop quality improvement activities that improve patient experience. \"I wrote up the protocol, and then everyone else kind of helped to revise it, and we finally got it going.\" Levels of NP role satisfaction are associated with role clarity within the healthcare team. \"...that's what I liked about being an NP , seeing my own patient, making the medical changes, and providing the education. But [in my former role], I ended up, on most days, doing more of an RN role.\"\"... if I want to see some sort of growth curve in my career, it's not going to be doing more care coordination....\" Most NPs interviewed had only minimal understanding of value -based payment legislation. With the national shift from fee -for-service to value -based payment models, further understanding the activities and contributions of nurse practitioners in specialty care, and how that contribution is recorded, is essential to navigating their role in patient care, care teams, and healthcare institutions, and their role in improving health outcomes. NPs in specialty care contribute to quality improvement activities, patient satisfaction and experience, and patient access in ways that may not be systematically documented, directly billed, or quantified on an institutional level. There is a need to better understand how to systematically assess NP contribution to value based care metrics. This understanding can inform further development of NP role definition. Clarity of role can serve to enhance NP job satisfaction and foster inter- professional practice.

Further experience with other teams may reveal key factors for successfully implementing organizational change. Lessons Learned: Through a dialogue, issues that affect the Blood Bank's workflow and pose risks to patient safety can be mitigated. Blood Bank Ambassador's Project CONNECT significantly improved interdepartmental communication by asserting common leadership and goals. Internal workflow was positively affected by a dramatic reduction in phone calls and time spent on clarifying concerns. The biggest take away is the improved relationship between PIC and Blood Bank, so even when we run into issues, they are addressed with professionalism and respect and a satisfactory solution is identified for both parties.

Post intervention, callnumber to27permonth, then decreased toanaverage of2.5calls permonth areduction ofmore than 98% from baseline callnumber and estimated time spent onphone calls. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Blood Bank Ambassadors Bridge Communication Gap and Sustainably Improve Workflow via \"Project Connect\" Antonio G. Insigne, Joseph Akin, Russell Buchanan, Gunter Ashok Nambiar, Morvarid Moayeri, Sara Bakhtary and Elena Nedelcu Department of Laboratory Medicine Division of Transfusion MedicineThe operational taskforce, Blood Bank Ambassadors, was assembled tobridge thecommunication gap and clarify workflow for nursing personnel .This group was formed bysupervisors, aspecialist and amedical director .Project CONNECT emerged with the specific aim ofimproving communication with PICpersonnel . Intervention strategies included : Establishing aplatform tosafely share ideas Identifying champions ofchange onboth sides Outlining and addressing most significant concerns onboth teams Clarifying common goals and ownership Establishing baseline and follow -upmetrics Initial meetings were held between Blood Bank Ambassadors and nursing team composed ofthePICNursing Manager ,Project Director -Experience Improvement, acharge nurse, abedside nurse and aninformation technology specialist. Issues/Problems specifically identified : Duplicate blood product orders Transfusion requirements notmatching patient's fileortransfusion guidelines Unreturned copy ofthepick-upslips Rejected samples forType Screen, ABO/Rh confirmation and additional specimen forcrossmatch Turn-around -time and blood product availability The initial meeting was followed byadditional clarifications and regular communication viaemail. Pre-and post -intervention metrics were the number ofcalls toBlood Bank and estimated time spent byBlood Bank staff to clarify issues and concerns raised bynursing personnel (See Table 1). PIC responses when asked about the \"Project CONNECT\" benefits: Nurses are better able to identify where in the process the blood products are by looking in the computer instead of calling. Knowing what to expect has decreased nurse and patient frustration. Nurses learned when to trust the system and when to call the blood bank. Nurses are willing to trouble shoot issues with unit experts before calling the blood bank. This decreases the extra work for nurses and the blood bank so that no blood is allocated if not necessary. Nurses are clear on labeling guidelines of type and screen, possibly decreasing unsigned tubes being sent over to the blood b ank.Reported calls/issues: January 2018 = 2 February 2018 = 1 March 2018 = 4 April 2018 = 3Every step inthetransfusion process from blood receipt to issuing istightly regulated by the Code ofFederal Regulations (CFR) 210, 211 and 606.Blood products are within the biologics and high risk medication category, therefore, adequate workflows toensure appropriate attention todetail isnecessary . can besignificantly impacted byinterruptions due tophone calls which negatively impact laboratory workflow and potentially affect patient care .

Staff engagement and positive feedback in of more that 50% in each core value was established as desirable baseline.Next Steps:Further analysis of accomplished and developing projects could highlight key individual and team factors determining project success. Dissemination:This model could be adopted/adapted in other UCSF Health settings, such as Mission Bay and Mt. Zion Blood Banks. Lessons Learned: Since the Quality Rounds have been implemented, unexpected opportunities and challenges have arisen. One of the most important lesson learned about our team's efforts is the immeasurable sense of shared vision, team power and common values.Blood transfusion is the most common hospital procedure and issuing the correct blood products is critical for patient's safety. Essential factors that influence the safety and quality of the services provided by Transfusion Medicine include adequate staffing, appropriate policies and standard operation procedures (SOPs), adequate monitoring of the processes, and continuous quality improvement. Interaction between team members is known to affect personal and collective well-being, and potentially affect workflow processes and team efficiency. UCSF culture fosters specific core values: Professionalism, Respect, Integrity, Diversity and Excellence (P .R.I.D.E) UCSF North Pillars strategic goals serve as a guide for alignment o team efforts. We aimed at aligning our team efforts to the specific North Pillar strategic goal of creating an optimal work experience. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Quality Rounds Boost P .R.I.D.E.

The Quality Rounds consists of daily planned interaction between leadership (supervisors, medical directors), Clinical laboratory Scientists (CLSs) and Hospital Laboratory Technicians (HLTs) . The aim of the Quality Rounds has been to capture direct information in order to assess opportunities for improvement and increase work efficiency on specific work stations: Blood Issuing, Specimen Receive and Entry, Traffic (Charge Tech), Immunohematology (Blood Bank testing), and Instrumentation ( Erytra ). Opportunities for improvement were discussed and prioritized, tasks were delegated and follow -up was performed according to urgency, impact and available resources. Some were solved ad -hoc, such as immediate patient -related issues, others have become projects requiring dedicated taskforce, such as the emergence of Blood Bank Ambassadors, a self -driven team aimed to improve communication with other hospital departments. In short time, the Blood Bank personnel has become increasingly engaged in reporting issues and finding solutions reinforcing a culture of safety, creativity and resourcefulness. An anonymous survey was initiated in May 2018 to retrospectively assess the effect of Quality Rounds on perceived P .R.I.D.E. core values. Results of the anonymous survey administered to day -shift CLS and HLT personnel: Respondents were 16 of 21 invited, with a survey response rate of 76% Responses were 75% or greater in combined \"Agree\" and \"Strongly Agree\" categories Opportunities for improvement are identified in: 1) Project follow -up and completion 2) Integration of additional work stations and team members in the Quality Rounds ProfessionalismRespectIntegrityDiversityExcellence 41To provide continuous improvement through the use of technology, the new Erytra analyzer can help sustain the upward trend along with other process improvement efforts to meet a 90% TAT for STAT Type and Screen orders. To install a fully automated analyzer that can work by batch or by individual sample and can handle STATs effectively. To configure the analyzer to fit our requirements: worksheet layout, user profiles and priorities. To keep a bidirectional interface system with our LIS and enable results crossover. To utilize a true walk -away instrument with the ability to continuously load samples without interruption . To eventually bring antibody identification on to the automated platformNext Steps: 1. To validate crossmatch testing and antibody identification. 2. A software upgrade to v4.0 will include many enhancements, such as the ability to detect new reagent lots that need QC testing and auto -validation and exporting of QC and patient results that fit acceptable criteria, while correcting several issues identified to date. Dissemination: The Erytra is expected to improve workflow and mitigate the problems in sample processing. In turn, delays in providing products for regular transfusion could be prevented. Lessons Learned: 1. Given variability in sensitivity of different platforms, monitoring of instrument performance continues post implementation. 2. Weak ABO reverse grouping -A new profile (A1B -INC) was introduced with extended R.T. incubation to 15 min from I.S. Results were compared to tube methodology and submitted to Grifols for analysis. 3. Incorrect volume errors -Typically due to splatter on gel cards or bubbles in samples. Currently, results are rejected and tests repeated. The v4.0 upgrade is expected to help mitigate these errors. The workload intheTransfusion Service continually increases .The oldanalyzer ,inuse since 2007 ,was only able toperform three STAT Type and Screens per 45minutes, tremendously impacting testing turn -around -times (TAT) . Due toTATs with theoldanalyzer, ahigh volume were tested manually inorder totryto reach acceptable TATs ofone hour from sample receipt toresulting, while other important tasks compete forthe CLS's time .Ithas been astruggle meeting itonamonthly basis The new automated analyzer, Grifols Erytra can rapidly perform testing because ofthe features unique to this machine including, organized software, continuous sample feeding, true STAT capability, atotal loading sample capacity of96 samples, 2probes, vertical design provides the operator with the flexibility tointeract with itatany time while inuse.With itsthree operational levels (upper, middle and lower), samples, reagents, diluents, gelcards, wash solutions, and solution and card wastes, areeasily managed . 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Implementation of a Fully Automated, Gel -based, High -Throughput Analyzer in the Parnassus Blood Bank Antonio G.

Correlation testing with theoldanalyzer was performed fortheABO/Rh and antibody screening. The donor unit ABO confirmations, DAT-IgGand Rh&Kantigen typings were correlated discordance forresults between thetwo analyzers were carefully evaluated and resolved using tube methodology .Inconjunction with automation, tube methods areused when indicated . SOPs fortheoperation, maintenance and quality control oftheErytra analyzers were written based ontheErytra Operator Training Manual and Instructions forUse (IFU). Turn Around Time (TAT) forSTAT TYSC samples with negative antibody screen willbecompared before and after the Erytras were implemented . On February 14, 2018, Erytra analyzer, a fully automated walk -away instrument was implemented. February 2018 was the adaptation month for all the CLS 's, just after successfully passing the training and competency assessment. Configured to fit the testing requirements including worksheet layout, profiles and interface system, the rate of improvement in TAT is expected to slope upwards.The continuous improvement efforts towards reaching our 90% TAT goal can be demonstrated with the upward trend and the 20% improvement from January 2017 through April 2018. Erytra analyzer is efficient and flexible in delivering highly reliable results, in as little time as possible. DG Gel 8 Cards Diluent DG Gel Negative Antibody Screen Meeting <60 Minute TAT Per Month (January 2017 -April 2018) 42There are multiple important takeaways from our QI analysis: PABD is still utilized with some physicians and clinical services being higher utilizers than others. Autologous donors consistently had post-PABD HB drops, and therefore lower starting HB values on day of surgery. Autologous donors are at high risk for exposure to perioperative transfusion, perhaps due to lower preoperative HB values after PABD or minimization of risks of autologous blood transfusion. Autologous blood was transfused before critically low HB values were reached: physicians are less likely to adhere to a restrictive transfusion approach when autologous blood is available. There is a high rate of waste of autologous units as they cannot be transferred to the general pool if not used by their donor. While the benefits of PABD may outweigh the harms for some patients (those with antibodies making crossmatching difficult, those who refuse allogeneic transfusion for strong personal reasons), these groups are in the minority. The practice of routine PABD needs to be re-evaluated. Clinicians should be aware of the current understanding of risks vs benefits of this practice and counsel patients appropriately. Next steps: Education! Education! Education! Education of both clinical services and patients about optimal perioperative blood management and alternative options for avoiding allogeneic blood transfusion. Recruit champions from various surgical departments and divisions to understand and promote evidence-based blood management. Exploration of other non-transfusion alternatives (preoperative iron or erythropoietin, acute normovolemic hemodilution) in high-risk donors. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Preoperative autologous blood collection: Iatrogenic anemia, high rates of transfusion and waste- An opportunity to improve patient blood management at UCSF Solmaz Manuel, M.D., Russell Thorsen, Elena Nedelcu, M.D., Sara Bakhtary, M.D. Departments of Anesthesiology & Laboratory Medicine Timeline of PABD Preoperative Autologous Blood Donation at UCSF Decline of PABD Year1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Units of Autologous Blood Donated by UCSF Patients0 100 200 300 400 500 60 83 111 137 211 247 261 404 485 453 174 126 227 337 302 355 330 379 338 455 PABD became popular and widely adopted in the 1980s and1990s with rising concerns over transfusion-transmitted HIV and non-A non-B hepatitis, physician fear of legal liability for adverse events, and the misperception that PABD carried almost no risk. California passed the \"Paul Gann Blood Safety Act\", mandating that physicians discuss PABD with patients. Wide-spread public health measures, rigorous pre-donor screening, and increased donor blood testing (serological and nucleic acid testing assays), significantly reduced risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV or HCV: now less than the risk of being killed by lightning in the US Despite waning indications (see below), PABD and transfusion of autologous blood remains a frequent practice at UCSF. We therefore sought to understand the impact of this practice to our patients by performing a retrospective audit of the PABD program at our institution over a two year period (2016-2017). After uncovering increased potential risks to our patients, high rates of wastage, and high utilizers; we now have targets for focused interventions to decrease inappropriate use of All Other Services 33% 67% 1990 2000s 2016 -17 2018 Transplant Surgery UCSF Services Overall Orthopedic factors have contributed to the decreased interest in PABD: Viral infection is no longer a significant threat Current risks of transfusion-transmitted viral infections: HCV: Estimated Risk of Transmission is 1:1,800,000 HIV: Estimated Risk of Transmission is 1:2,300,000 HBV: Estimated Risk of Transmission is 1:800,000 Risk is the same between auto & allo units A Cochrane meta-analysis did not find a significant difference in the rate of infection in patients randomized to autologous vs. allogenic blood transfusion. Autologous transfusion also shares many other risks with allogenic blood transfusion, including: risk of bacterial contamination, hemolysis (ABO incompatibility due to administrative errors), volume overload (TACO), and transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI). PABD exacerbates preoperative anemia HB consistently decreases by ~1 g/dL for each auto unit donated. Compensatory erythropoesis has not occurred after PABD in clinical studies. PABD increases risk of transfusion The Cochrane Review on PAD showed that the risk of receiving any blood transfusion increased with PABD by 24% (RR=1.29: 95%CI: 1.12,1.48). PABD is expensive Estimates have shown the total cost of autologous units to be more than 70 times the costs of allogeneic units.11.6 g/dL EBL 351 mL PABD is known to increase the risk of perioperative anemia. Compensatory erythropoiesis requires more than three weeks. Patients at our institution do not show signs of HB regeneration before surgery. All but 4 donors experienced a drop in HB values from baseline (prior to autologous blood unit donation) to immediately before surgery. The mean drop in HB was 1.3 g/dL (\u00b10.9). Conclusions & Next StepsIn 2016 & 2017, 118 patients underwent PABD and donated 143 autologous red blood cell units before surgical procedures at UCSF. This is a decline from previous years. Predonated autologous PRBC were transfused to 33% of patients. Mean was 88% had 10 g/dL. 351 mL. 67% of auto units wastedOver 2016-2017, the four most common clinical services using the PABD program were liver transplant (45%), gynecology (13%), orthopedic surgery (10%), and urology (9%). Of the 143 units, 64% were collected for surgeries performed by four surgeons. Of the 118 patients who underwent PABD, surgery was canceled or postponed for 9%. 67% of units were wasted and 33% were transfused.Preoperative autologous blood donation (PABD): the donation of one or more units of a patient's own blood before high anticipated blood loss elective surgery; this blood is stored at the blood bank and is available for transfusion during and/or after surgery. Trend in mean HB values before PABD, immediately before surgery, after surgery, and at discharge. Of the patients who were transfused autologous units, 6 patients received allogeneic blood products in addition to autologous units, and 80% of patients had post-operative Hgb>10 g/dL. Unit Wastage is measured: Instructions home care/patient education: Increase Experience Dash metric to a mean of 92. Institute Preop phone calls and evaluate Post -op phone calls: Increase Experience Dash metric to a mean of 80. Information about delays: Increase Experience Dash metric to a mean of 94.5. Next Steps: Continue to improve and evaluate Preop phone call process. Develop website including critical information outlined in Patient -Family Council survey. Future patients and families to reference prior to surgery. Adjustments made to text -email notifications. Additional options added for staff to utilize for family notification. Dissemination: All of our interventions could be adopted and formatted as needed for every department throughout UCSF Health Lessons Learned: What we as clinicians believe patients want may be different than what is expected. Simple tests of changes can provide a real difference to the Patient Experience.Problem identified: Opportunity for improvement on communication with patients throughout the Perioperative experience seen on Experience Dash. Patients and families did not feel they received helpful or effective information prior to and during surgery. Post -op phone calls indicated lack of information on After Visit Summary. Patients found to have questions about their wound care that was not clearly communicated.

ML PACU & Perioperative Services Background Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Barriers to adequate communication: Uncertain what information patients and families needed to prepare for surgery. Multiple calls and inconsistent communication given to patient prior to surgery=unaware what department was communicating what. No reliable way to communicate to family while patient in surgery. Home care instructions difficult to follow, long, and did not provide most important information at the forefront of the document. Did not include adequate information to care for oneself after surgery. Interventions to improve communication: Initiated FY18 IAP goal for decreasing post -op phone calls related to wound care. Created sticker to place on dressings reminding patients when to remove their dressing. PACU RNs began highlighting key wound care information on AVS. Surveyed Patient Family Council requesting what information is needed prior to surgery to be prepared. Developed Preop Phone call script including information found from survey. Preop phone calls initiated in November 2017. Activated text/email notifications to families on December 1, 2017. Family members receive canned messages notifying of patient status throughout Periop. OR and PACU nurses send additional messages about their care. Edited Post -op phone call script for better patient ease and understanding.

Lessons Learned 45UCSF Medical Center's True North pillars provide long -term objectives and guides for prioritizing their initiatives. In alignment with the True North Pillar: Patient Experience Dr. Emily von Scheven established the UCSF Child and Adolescent Chronic Illness Center (CIC). The vision is for multidisciplinary teams of clinicians and caregivers to join forces with patients, families, and the community, to transform healthcare for children living with chronic illness. Addressing mental health needs is essential to optimizing the wellbeing of children with chronic illness as they grow into adulthood. The Mental Health Working Group (MHWG) was established to develop strategies to support the emotional well -being of children and adolescents who are coping with chronic illness. The framework for this project was derived from research on post- traumatic growth (salutary adaptation to stressful life events) and trauma- informed care (treatment that takes into account the influence of trauma and recovery). https://childhoodchronicillness.ucsf.edu/ The goals are: 1. To develop a better understanding of coping and resilience of patients with a chronic illness 2. To define factors that impact coping and resilience 3. To identify factors that can be modified to promote positive psychological growth 4. To provide education and support to stakeholders -clinicians, caregivers, patients, families, and community organizations.We anticipate that the CIC MHWG will have a positive impact on patient experience by enhancing the emotional well -being of chronically ill patients and their families by promoting positive psychological growth. The impact of the CIC MHWG will be evaluated through assessment of clinical and process outcome measures, such as changes in the scores of Brief Resilience Scale. As we continue to prioritize our patient and family advisor partnership we will foster consistent, current qualitative data gathering and analysis. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium UCSF Child & Adolescent Chronic Illness Center Mental Health Working Group Co-Leaders: Eva Ihle, MDPhD Khyati Brahmbhatt, MD Brian Lasofsky , Rachel Hale, Rosa Kelekian, Nancy Cushen- White, Nancy Netherland, Laura Quill, Camryn Barker, Alexa Hughes, Sonia Milbank, Mariel La Amy Whittle Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Lessons Learned, Next Steps, & DisseminationFigure 1.

The MHWG will lead an initiative to incorporate resilience screening of patients and their family members into CIC clinic visits. Dissemination:An approach to patient care that emphasizes emotional well -being can easily be adapted for use in other UCSF Health settings. General ApproachCurrent Process Figure 2. Radial Venn diagram representing some of the factors that contribute to youth resilience. The red circles (right) are factors that are more difficult to modify, while the green circles (left) are the potential targets of interventions.Our project promotes both attitudes and behaviors that support a strengths- based approach to enhancing emotional well- being in patients with chronic illness. As a start, we are highlighting concepts such as medical trauma, post- traumatic growth, resilience, and trauma -informed care. The overarching goal is for everyone to understand that mental health needs to be factored into the treatment plan for chronic illness (there is no health without mental health). 46The overall goals of the Child and Adolescent Chronic Center are: To help children and adolescents with chronic illness achieve wellness over an entire lifetime. To create a new kind of health care system, that takes \"the long view\".We anticipate that the UCSF Chronic Illness Center will support a number of UCSF -wide missions including the goals of developing innovative and collaborative approaches to health care and research that span disciplines as well as delivering high quality patient -centered care. We plan to measure impact using the following metrics: Review of stakeholder representation Google Analytics of Chronic Illness Center website Number of presentations Number of grants submitted Diversity Assessments [Fig.4] 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium UCSF Child and Adolescent Chronic Illness Center Creating Wellness For Children Growing Up with Chronic Disease Director :Emily von Scheven Workgroup Co-Leads: Bhupinder Juno Duenos, Linda Franck, Christina Frenzel, Rebecca Gates, Sharon Gee, Jennifer Graves, Bekah Hale, Rachel Hale, Mel Heyman, Becky Higbee, Caroline Hill, Elizabeth Joe Sullivan, John Takyama Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Although medical advances have resulted in improved treatments for many childhood diseases, most treatments have not resulted in cure. Thus, children continue to live with their disease as they enter adulthood. Unfortunately, over time, many conditions lead to secondary morbidities, both due to the underlying on- going disease and the associated long- term treatment. Thus, in addition to carrying their underlying chronic disease with them to adulthood, these children often acquire new morbidities as they age. Management of disease become complicated and it last forever [Fig. 1]. The \"best practice\" for these children is poorly defined. To address these issues, Dr. Emily von Scheven, established the UCSF Child and Adolescent Chronic Illness Center (CIC) (http://childhoodchronicillness.ucsf.edu ). Her vision is for a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and caregivers to join forces with patients, families, and the community, to build a team that provides unique, coordinated and collaborative care that spans a lifetime [Fig. 2]. Ultimately, the center will provide the infrastructure needed to deliver and evaluate personalized care for each child with a chronic disease. Next Steps:Develop research questions inspired by parent/caregiver, adult, and youth focus groups [Fig.3] Seek out funding for project through grant writing Continue to develop programs and support the ongoing efforts headed by each of the sub-workgroups in Transition, Mental Health andCommunications & Outreach Secure a physical space to serve as UCSF's Child & Adolescent Chronic Illness Center Dissemination:This improvement project is creating a new kind of healthcare system that will transform how UCSF currently approaches childhood chronic illness Lessons Learned: Common, overlapping issues and solutions do exist across all chronic conditions. Focus groups serve as a unique opportunity for patients and families to create social connections and support for one another. By engaging all specialties and disciplines for the common purpose of the Chronic Illness Center, a comprehensive list of services and resources has been catalogued, which can be used to improve efficiency and care at UCSF. Recruiting and retaining a diverse representation of patients and families to actively participate in Chronic Illness Center efforts is an are prevalent when patients with childhood- onset chronic conditions transfer from pediatric to adult care settings (CHOP PolicyLab, 2017). Poor transfer of information negatively impact both the provider and patient experience of care. At UCSF there is no system in place to support comprehensive, concise and effective transfer of information when patients with longstanding chronic illness move from pediatric to adult care. To address this gap, our work group chose to create a modular, structured, APEX -based transfer summary intended to provide the information adult providers need when assuming the care of a young adult with longstanding chronic illness.Next Steps: Create Transfer Summary template in APEX Identify project coordinator Develop APEX queries to identify pediatric patients ready to transfer to UCSF adult care Begin structured handoff pilot July 2018 Dissemination:Implement structured handoffs for patients transferring to adult care outside the UCSF system Lessons Learned: Multidisciplinary engagement from project start is key to success. Maintaining patient engagement is challenging. APEX modifications are difficult to execute.With improved treatments for previously fatal diseases, more children are surviving into adulthood with chronic health conditions. These young people face a lifetime of disease, and may develop new problems as a result of long -term exposure to their underlying condition or the medications used to control it. They also face the challenges inherent in a lifetime of navigating the health care system. The UCSF Childhood Chronic Illness Center is a multidisciplinary, interdepartmental initiative that aims to develop innovative approaches to care, addressing the unique challenges faced by children growing up with chronic illness. http://childhoodchronicillness.ucsf.edu As they transition to adulthood, young people with chronic illness must learn to manage their health condition and navigate the transition from pediatric -to adult -oriented health care. The CIC Transition Work Group aims to improve this transition by better preparing patients to manage their health independently, and by optimizing UCSF health care systems to meet patient care needs during this transition.

Steven Chu, Pathology IT, needed to research and create a telepathology system to meet our needs. Next Steps:To design a new cart for PCMB with further improvements such as higher speed and higher resolution software/hardware, an ergonomic height adjustable table, and wireless headsets. Dissemination: Cytotechnologists are skilled and experienced in rapid evaluation of image -guided fine needle aspirations and their willingness to take on this task has proven to be beneficial in increasing productivity. Other departments may be able to identify and educate staff who are then able to extend the capabilities of duties performed by medical staff. Lessons Learned: Cytopathologists have saved valuable time after implementation of telepathology for rapid adequacy assessment of image -guided fine needle aspiration procedures without compromising adequacy. Overall, telepathology is an ideal alternative method.Historically, cytopathologists provided rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of image -guided fine needle aspirations (FNA) using a conventional microscope onsite. In recent years, the demand for ROSE in large medical centers has dramatically increased, which costs cytopathologists' valuable time (travelling to multiple physical locations for the procedures) and affects other clinical, academic and administrative duties. These factors influenced FNA turn around time (TAT) which negatively impacted UCSF Health's True North Pillar of delivering an outstanding patient experience.Unsatisfactory rate of the samples was comparable with and without telepathology with no significant difference (see Table 1, Figure 1). Cytopathologist time was significantly reduced on average from 36 minutes to 9 minutes/patient, which potentially reduced sign out turn- around time (TAT) for fine needle aspirations (FNA) and other diagnostic services. As part of the True North Staff Engagement and Growth, we expanded the role, clinical knowledge, professional development, and satisfaction for our cytotechnologists. Table 1.

Images were captured via Luminera Infinity HD camera connected to on-site microscope (see Image 1). 270 FNAs were evaluated for adequacy using telepathology where a trained cytotechnologist went onsite, prepared and streamed slides on Jabber\u00ae video; simultaneously communicating with remote pathologist over a secure network. The adequacy as well as further steps was guided by pathologist. The data on adequacy of each sample, time spent by pathologist on phone, and total time spent by cytotechnologist was recorded. The Data was compared with 251 cases of ROSE without telepathology. 49To create a system that enables all specimens to be tracked from the time of accessioning to the time of discard. In the event of a missing specimen, this system should allow us to re -trace our steps to identify the last known location of a specimen. The ideal system:1.Should be easy to use. 2.Should be easy to train new users. 3.Should have minimal disruptions to the established workflow.Next Steps:Currently, there is no system in place to measure compliance. Random \"spot checks\" are performed which show that users are consistently scanning containers to the appropriate shelf. Dissemination:Other laboratory divisions that are currently utilizing a manual filing system could benefit by implementing a similar system. Lessons Learned: Implementing a new system is always challenging. It is critical to provide proper training and support when new systems are put into place.For Fiscal Year 2016- 2017, two specimens were lost following gross evaluation (grossing) and were never located. This negatively impacted UCSF Health's True North Pillar of creating an outstanding patient experience. Fiscal Year 2016- 2017 68,144 specimens were accessioned among the three separate campuses (Mt. Zion, Moffitt -Long and Mission Bay). 33,277 specimens were grossed at the hospital of origin. 34,867 specimens were sent via our courier network to a second hospital for grossing and storage. History2D barcodes are generated from our Laboratory Information System (CoPath ) and placed on specimen containers at the time of receipt (accessioning). Specimens were tracked up until the time of grossing. Following grossing, specimens were manually filed onto shelves at all three campuses. Specimens were held for 20 days after the pathology report was finalized ( signout ). 20 days after signout , specimens were discarded by generating a list from CoPath and manually reconciling the specimens from this list. ProblemsMisfiled specimens required extensive searching. Missing specimens and specimens discarded prematurely could lead to compromised patient care and potentially incomplete and/or inadequate diagnoses. All specimens are tracked from time of receipt to time of discard. Gross room staff, trainees, managers and Medical Directors have all been supportive of this system. Since implementation, no specimens have gone missing. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Utilization of 2D Barcodes to Track Chain of Custody for All Surgical Pathology Specimens Grefka R, Cho S, Chu S, Law G, Kim GE Department of Pathology Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Each specimen storage shelf at all three campuses was assigned its own unique 2D barcode. A new tracking system was created in CoPath in which the 2D barcode on the appropriate shelf is scanned, followed by the 2D barcode on the specimen container. A new tracking system was created in CoPath for tissue discard in which all containers are scanned prior to discard. If containers are not ready for discard an error message is displayed which users cannot over -ride. 50Therapists in the Rehabilitation Department are expected to evaluate/treat 6 patients each day. The goal of this scheduling pilot is to enable therapists to meet this productivity goal as reflected by percentage of the core team of PTs and OTs working on 7E/L. Current State: 58% of core therapists on 7E/L meet productivity of 6 or more patients/day Team average is 5.6 patients/day *Weekdays February 1 -28/2018 Target State: 80% of core therapists on 7E/L will meet productivity of 6 or more patients/dayTeam average will be 6 or more patients/day *Weekdays April 2 -May 4/2018Next Steps: The next phase of our scheduling trial is to train and enact the scheduling system among therapists beyond the core therapists (i.e., per diem, float, students, etc) who work on 7E/L and analyze the effect of scheduling on the broader group. We also hope to digitize the scheduling system so that it is more easily viewable and modifiable. Dissemination: This scheduling system could be generalized to rehabilitative services on other acute care floors. Lessons Learned: The scheduling system would be difficult for non- core team members to implement as per diem and float therapists often cover multiple floors in a given day and may not start their day on 7E/L to write up their schedule. The schedule can be difficult to modify or adjust as the day goes on given that updating it requires walking room to room and adjusting times. Rehabilitative services are essential to patients' recovery and discharge planning on a busy musculoskeletal floor, but there are many barriers to seeing patients in a timely, efficient manner. Often therapists plan to see a patient, but they are turned away because the patient is inadequately pre-medicated, off the floor for a procedure or imaging, working with another discipline, or mentally or physically unprepared. Unsuccessful attempts to see patients can result in care delays, repeated attempts to see a single patient -sometimes at the expense of seeing other patients -and a less efficient or productive day. Many barriers to seeing patients when intended are preventable or avoidable, but with an improvised daily schedule known only to the treating therapist, other team members do not have the opportunity to coordinate care to minimize barriers or interruptions. The 7 Long Rehabilitative Services Scheduling Pilot project improves timely access to patients through setting and communicating a daily therapy schedule to the interdisciplinary team. This positively impacts the Strategic Growth True North Pillar by expanding our reach and optimizing access to patients and works toward our department goal of working individually and with a larger interdisciplinary team to ensure \"right service, right patient, right time.\" 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium 7 Long Rehabilitative Services Scheduling Pilot Heffernan OTD, OTR/L, Maya Manning PT, DPT, and Maureen May, rehab aide Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Through an A3 Analysis, we identified common root causes of unsuccessful attempts to see patients for therapy: patient is inadequately pre -medicated, patient is off the floor for a procedure or imaging, patient is working with another discipline, or patient is mentally/physically unprepared for therapy. We hypothesize that by communicating a therapy schedule to the multidisciplinary team, these barriers could be minimized, access to patients could be improved, and efficiency/productivity would improve in turn. To communicate a therapy schedule, our rehabilitation aide created laminated cards to be used in the existing communication slots outside patient rooms. The cards are assigned to each room on 7L and have a designated space for the name of the PT and OT and what time each plan to see the patient. Every morning, therapists go from room to room and write their name and planned time on the cards with erasable marker and every afternoon before the end of the standard therapy work day (8:00 am - 4:30 pm) the rehabilitation aide wipes the cards clean in preparation for the next day. The card placement is clearly visible to anyone entering the patient's room and is generally posted by 9:30 am when most therapists begin seeing patients. The scheduling pilot was successful in improving the percentage of core staff meeting productivity expectations with an increase of over 10% of therapists seeing 6 or more patients per day, starting at 58% and improving to 73%. The team average productivity increased from 5.60 to 6.06 patients per day. The figure below represents percentage of team members seeing 6 or more patients per day in two- week intervals. Qualitative feedback on the scheduling trial has been positive. \"It's nice to know when therapy is coming so we're not guessing...I can see who is assigned, but now I know when.\" -Christina O. RN \"The scheduling is great. It's what patients can expect if they are going on to acute rehab.\" -Chrstine O.M. NP \"I love the scheduling.

Continue momentum on the unit by providing weekly updates on progress and give real time feedback when performing chart audit s. Identify barriers in situations that QBL is not completed and what we can do to help QBL continue to be a success. Dissemination: Delayed recognition of excessive blood loss is a leading cause of postpartum morbidity and mortality. Accurately identifying blood loss is crucial in providing safe on time care. This improvement work would be useful in possible settings where blood loss can also be detrimental if not treated correctly. Lessons Learned: Value in partnering with UCLA to learn how they were doing, both around QBL and TeamSTEPPS. Allowed the team to make what was thought to be impossible possible. Don't make big changes all at once - give people time to learn and adjust to new processes/practice. Invest time and resources in superusers /experts who can help train and mentor clinical staff. Launch a \"soft rollout\" to gather input from clinicians and test on -the-ground implications. Provide standardized education and training. Medical Center financial and administrative support is crucial.Obstetric hemorrhage is one of the leading causes of severe maternal morbidity and mortality in California and across the country. In the U.S., the overall rate of postpartum hemorrhage increased 26% between 1994 and 2006. This increase was driven primarily by a 50% increase in uterine atony cases. In 2017, the UCSF annual rate was 22.8%, compared to 22.3% across the UC system. Problems with recognition, treatment, and poor communication have been shown to contribute to maternal death. These factors include denial and delay of hemorrhage, under estimation of blood loss, and lack of skill in accurately assessing Quantitative Blood Loss (QBL). Advanced planning is critical in launching a rapid, coordinated response. Evidence has shown that implementing systematic protocols for recognizing and responding to hemorrhage have demonstrated improved outcomes such as decreased use of blood products and higher level interventions. In April 2018, UCSF rolled out a new protocol to improve standardization and accuracy of blood loss estimation to reduce hemorrhage risk and improve patient care. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Addressing Obstetric Hemorrhage at UCSF: Implementing a Quantitative MD Melissa Rosenstein, MD UCSF Birth Center Perinatal Services Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned With the presented background and goal it was evident that the Birth Center needed to change and align with the current pract ice recommendations. A core planning group was formed to plan this huge practice change. We identified several barriers that would be our biggest challenge. Some of the barriers include: 1) nurses reluctant to perform QBL given history of this practice roll o ut in the past, 2) adding another task to daily duties of nurses, 3) providers not wanting to admit to large blood losses, and 4) COMMUNICATION. Our first priority was gaining buy in from all staff (nurses and MD's). A TeamSTEPPS approach was used for communication and implementation. Test runs of QBL were completed in vaginal and c -section deliveries. By doing test runs, QBL was present on the floor, allowed staff to give input and feedback and in turn was the driver in developing the process. The development process encompassed creating a workflow that would be realistic and sustainable at the bedside and building tools to aid in the calcu lation of QBL. A QBL flowsheet calculator and audit report was developed for APEx as our technical analytic project components. Once the workflows were established dissemination of this information was our next task. We leveraged the unit Annual Skills Validation (ASV) to educate 200+ staff on QBL process. The ASV session comprised of a 30 minute lecture and a hands on skillsstation. A soft roll out was implemented 4 weeks prior to the GO LIVE date. The soft rollout allowed us to collect data prior toGO LIVE to measure progress. A group of 30 superusers/experts supported both day and night shift during the GO LIVE. Superusers helped design the workflow and were trained on it. QBL superusers were also given guided expectations on their role. This role included being present a t births and completing a skills checklist for staff. With the assistance of PRIME we were able to support our unit with 24/7 coverage of superusers during the first 2 weeks of QBL GO LIVE. After the 2 weeks our QBL superusers were assigned to the Resource RN role t o provide continued support for QBL. Daily audits of all births paired with real time feedback to staff has helped with sustaining our goals. 24%21% 22%28%98%100% 94% 93% 50% 43%46%42%100% 87%100% 93% 0%20%40%60%80%100%120% Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8Cumulative Percentage of Vaginal and C - Section Deliveries with QBL Protocol Vaginal C-SectionPilot Department Rollout* Target: 80% Department Rollout Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Delivery # QBL % QBL Delivery # QBL % QBL Delivery # QBL % QBL Delivery # QBL % QBL Vaginal 45 44 98% 48 48 100% 49 46 94% 29 27 93% C-Section 17 17 100% 15 13 87% 17 17 100% 15 44 93% Total 62 33 98% 63 61 97% 66 63 95% 44 41 93%This initiative is part of the statewide pay- for- performance program called PRIME (Public Hospital Redesign Incentive Program), which aims to promote evidence -based methods to improve health outcomes across CA's public hospitals. The PRIME program includes ambitious targets across 55 metrics that span nine care delivery domains, including Perinatal Care. One of the main goals in perinatal care is to ensure and support best practices to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with obstetrical hemorrhage. The OB Hemorrhage Safety Bundle is a perinatal care metric, which requires hospitals to complete 16 elements to help ensure timely recognition of hemorrhage as well as an organized and swift response. One of these 16 elements is developing and implementing a protocol for QBL. The target is >80% of births must adhere to the new QBL protocol by June 2018. *Note: all data represented is cumulative. Data abstracted from QBL flowsheet and manual chart review for C -Section cases. 52We strongly desire to see NO violence in our workplace, however we must approach our target goals with a realistic expectation of the environment in which we work. The Emergency Dept. is the frontline of care for acutely psychotic, drug and alcohol abuse patients. This population presents challenges for the unanticipated events of violence towards our staff. Therefore we choose to set our target goal to a reduction of 10% to 26 total incidents of workplace violence for three consecutive months during FY18 . We have exceeded our goal, and continue to disseminate our findings to staff and explore new approaches to create a safe environment of care 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Work Place Violence Prevention Parnassus ED UBLT Laura Jacobson ED manager, Steve Polevoi Medical director, Liz Kwan MD, James Beach RN Psych Work Group Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Workplace Violence staff survey April 2017 I have a safe work environment free from physical or verbal abuse from patients and/or visitors.

Specific Aim: We aim to increase the percentage of patients who have 4V+1S+2P to at least 54% by the end of 2018. Next Steps:Work with pulmonary practice leadership to transition clinic quarterback roles to medical assistant(s). Create system for pre -clinic communication with patients to organize visit itinerary. Gauge interest in Tele -health. Coach adult CF patients on recognizing their role in partnering with the care team.Dissemination:Ambulatory practices serving patients with chronic diseases may benefit from a medical assistant in a 'clinic QB' role. A designated cellphone for communication, scheduling appointments and managing patient relations is useful. Lessons Learned: Clinic coordination and patient relations do not require a registered nurse; a medical assistant can fulfill the role. Tailored communication strategies and personalized agendas for each clinic visit are important ways to partner with patients in achieving guideline care .The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Adult Care Guidelines recommend four visits with the care team, one sputum culture and two pulmonary function tests (4V+1S+2P) per year. Through the CFF patient care registry the UCSF Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center tracks its performance relative to this measure. In 2016 only 45% of patients achieved the standard of 4V+1S+2P . This was below the national average of 53.6%, and below the Center's 2015 achievement of 54%. Low participation in CF clinic undermines the opportunity to detect and address care needs, and to provide care team support to patients in sustaining complex daily care. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium The Clinic Quarterback: A New Play on Partnering with Cystic Fibrosis Patients Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center Caitlin Hogan RD, Srey Sam , Mary Ellen Kleinhenz MD, Diana Dawson RN, PNP, Jonathan Budzik MD, PhD, Michelle Yu, MD, University of California San Francisco Medical Center and Department of Medicine, San Francisco, California, USA Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Hypothesis : If the CF Center expanded the pool of available appointments, and proactively managed patient relationships by tailoring communication and clinic visits, a higher proportion of patients will achieve the guideline care of 4V+1S+2P.

Develop consistent case definitions that include criteria for hospital vs. community acquisition Create a response algorithm that can be followed when cases of concern are identified Incorporate fungal surveillance into the routine tasks of the data management unit to ensure timely review of patients and identification of hospital onset cases Create an process for communicating findings within HEIC units, and to nursing unit, ancillary and clinical personnel as neededNext steps: Continue work with Infection Control Medical Directors to refine IFI case definitions tailored to UCSF patient populations Assess whether additional flags need to be added in the tool to ensure review of all potential cases Analyze data to identify possible contributing environmental factors for proven IFI cases Perform an interrater reliability study to determine if reviewers are interpreting the definition the same to a sufficient degree. We should have a high level of agreement when reviewing the same sample of cases Dissemination: Integrate IFI surveillance and follow- up into routine HEIC activities Share tool and findings with providers from relevant services (e.g. Adult/ Peds Infectious Diseases, Malignant Hematology, etc.) should they be interested in having it available for their use Lessons Learned: Utilization of a standardized definition in itself is a huge advancement in reducing the \"noise\" and variability in the cases we choose for further review and escalate to clinical staff for additional follow up and management 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium A Systematic Approach to Identifying Invasive Fungal Infections (IFI) in Hospitalized Patients Laurel Gibbs, Ho Lom Lee, Amy Nichols, Lynn Ramirez, Jonathan Schouest, Kim Stanley, Lusha Wang, Deborah Yokoe Hospital Epidemiology & Infection Control Data Management Unit Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned We modeled our surveillance elements on a algorithm obtained from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA based on published IFI definitions1. Data elements were defined and extracted from Clarity with the goal of minimizing \"noise\" (false positive results) in order to generate a comprehensive picture of patients in whom there was a clinical concern for fungal infection including:Problem list entry indicative of fungal infection (or concern for it) Positive galactomannan antigen Positive -D-glucan Universal Microbial DNA test positive for a mold Mold identified on a microbiology culture Pathology or radiologic imaging results suggestive of fungal infection Receipt of any of a list of specific antifungal medications Recognizing the need to have results available on demand without the intermediate step of a request to the programmer, the report evolved into a web- based tool that directly queries Clarity to produce a line list of patients with new results from the past week and includes a score indicating the number of \"hits\" on the elements above which aids in prioritizing patient revie w. A drill down can be performed on any patient on the list to show detailed results and to allow the reviewer to minimize time spent performing chart review. Each weekday, HEIC Data Management staff evaluates each case with a score of 3 or higher to evaluate for hospital vs. community onset, as well as the likelihood of true fungal disease vs. colonization. Hospital onset cases of probable or prov en fungal infection are communicated to HEIC Field Unit for further follow up. 1De Pauw B, et al. Clin Infect Dis 2008;46:1813- 1821 For this section, I would like to add a screen shot of Fungi can cause severe and life-threatening infections among immunocompromised patients. Hospital outbreaks of mold infections associated with construction activities or hospital ventilation issues have been described. Detection of hospital -acquired invasive fungal infection (IFI) cases allows for timely investigation to look for possible breaches in airhandling, construction barriers or other measures put into place to prevent mold intrusion and enables rapid mitigation to prevent ongoing risks to vulnerable patients. Two recent cases of apparent hospital acquired mold infection at Mission Bay highlighted a weakness in an otherwise comprehensive surveillance program: We did not have a systematic way to proactively identify cases of fungal infection. Microbiologic culture of clinical specimens for mold is insensitive. Antigenic and molecular technologies are emerging as more sensitive and rapid indicators of IFI. Results from these technologies combined with clinical features and radiology results can be used to produce a profile that identifies patients likely to have IFI. We needed a system to efficiently gather the data elements that would help us recognize hospital onset fungal infection in a timely way and a consistent process to use these results to initiate appropriate investigation.

Next Steps: Continue to coach the charge nurses to hardwire the practice of performing one CAUTI prevention care bundle each shift and provide just -in-time coaching to the staff nurses on maintaining the care bundle components. Dissemination: This improvement work has been shared with the other Adult Inpatient Nursing units on a quarterly basis. Lessons Learned: The high CAUTI count in FY17 provided the unit with an opportunity to improve patient safety and quality. One of the challenges was identifying unit champions to raise awareness of the patient care issue and be resources to the clinical nurses. Identifying the charge nurse group as the champions provided the best opportunity to have a core group of RNs who covered both A and P shifts.In FY17, the Adult Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Marrow Transplant units of 11 Long/12 Long had 12 catheter- associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI). This was a significant increase from the FY16 total of 2 CAUTI events. Due to the significant rise in FY17 CAUTI events, it was imperative that 11L/12L address this metric in FY18. CAUTI events can ultimately increase a patient's length of stay (LOS), and overall hospital costs. CAUTI is a hospital- acquired condition (HAC) and negatively impacts UCSF Health True North pillar of Quality and Safety and our organizational goal to achieve zero harm. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium CAUTI Reduction Adult Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Marrow Transplant Units 11 Long/12 Long Adult Hematology/Oncology/ Blood and Marrow Transplant Florlina Agudelo, RN, Ballard, Andrea Plati, MSN, RN, OCN Katie Segev, MSN, RN, OCN Background Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons and 12L We are well on our way of achieving our outstanding performance of less than 7 CAUTI in FY18!! 56Improve cost of care by providing the appropriate vascular access device for patients and reducing inappropriate use of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC). Improve patient experience by reducing insertion attempts for patients with challenging venous access and obtaining reliable access using ultrasound guided peripheral intravenous catheters ( USGPIV) in optimal vessels. Suboptimal PIV Sites Next Steps: With educational outreach and the ability to obtain reliable access with USGPIV in optimal vessels, VAST would like to further study: Will there be a decrease in inappropriate PICC orders? Will this effort decrease PICC line days and PICC associated CLABSI rates? Dissemination: VAST continues to conduct educational outreach, just in time teaching and are readily available for consult via CareWeb. Lessons Learned: The use of an ultrasound eliminated repeat and unnecessary cannulation attempts which can cause patient discomfort, vascular injuries and delay in therapy. Having a dedicated team specialized in vascular access ensures the patient receives the appropriate device for infusion therapy. Total PIV insertions continue to outnumber the total PICC insertions each month which in turn reduces cost of care. Background Peripheral venous access is the most frequently used procedure in hospitals to obtain blood samples and to infuse intravenous (IV) medications and fluids.1 However, the incidence of failed attempts among emergency department patients is about 10% to 21%.1 There are many challenging patient populations which make peripheral intravenous (PIV) access difficult without the use of an ultrasound (e.g. IV drug abusers, obese patients, dehydrated patients, and patients who have undergone chemotherapy). 1 In a prospective, observational study conducted by Au, et al. 2012, ultrasound guidance prevented the need for central venous catheter (CVC) placement in 85% of patients deemed difficult IV access. 2 An international panel of experts developed The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC) using a validated method to define appropriate indications for inserting the right vascular access device across patient populations.3 Performance Data One year after implementation, VAST observed an increase in PIV insertions by 63% and a dramatic decrease in PICC insertions by 37% resulting in 298 PIVs and 177 PICCs. With a shift in less PICC insertions and an increase in PIV insertions, VAST achieved a reduction in total vascular access device costs. Expanding the scope of the Vascular Access Support Team in placing USGPIVs reduces the need for inappropriate CVC placements in patients with difficult IV access which in turn potentially reduces cost of care (PICC =$228 versus PIV=$5) and morbidity associated with CVCs (e.g. central line associated bloodstream infections CLABSI). 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Improving Appropriateness of Vascular Access Device Use in Adult Patients with Ultrasound Guided Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Insertions by the Vascular Access Support Team Michele Nomura, MSN, RN, CNRN, VA -BC Elizabeth Sin, MS, BSN, CCRN Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned In December 2016, the UCSF Adult Vascular Access Support Team (VAST) assumed responsibility in supporting all challenging inpatient vascular access needs during the day. The PIV Insertion Algorithm was updated and distributed to all nursing units on how to consult VAST for assistance with ultrasound guided peripheral intravenous ( USGPIV) catheters. VAST conducted educational outreach at unit staff meetings, just in time teaching, and hospital wide presentations at multidisciplinary rounds.

Our study period is from July 2017 to the end of April 2018.African -Americans comprise 12.2% of patients with hypertension at UC PrimaryCare (UCPC) The rate of uncontrolled hypertension among African -Americans was about 41%, compared to 25.7% uncontrolled in all otherracial groups (Oct 2017) Hypertension increases the risk ofcardiovascular comorbidities andcomplications Improving hypertension control for subpopulations supports the UCSF Health True North strategic priorities of 1) PatientExperience, and 2) Quality and Safety Impact: African American control rates across UCPC improved by 10% Hypertension control rates for our intervention group improved 37.5 % (n=15) Our intervention led to the implementation of a new methodology forhypertension \"control\" measurement criteria in population health. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Improving Hypertension Control for African Americans at UCPC Christopher Cai MS1, Carmen Lee Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project GoalsProject Evaluation & Impact Gap Analysis : A literature review revealed that the disparity in hypertension control rates in African Americans (AAs) was often the result of a complex interplay of personal, clinical and structural factors. Interviews with interdisciplinary team members, including 2 RNs, 1 LVN and a practice manager were conducted using a \"5 Whys\" root cause analysis yielding the analysis in Fig 1. Intervention: Based on the gaps, we developed a phone outreach intervention for our African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension patients to: 1)Schedule blood pressure check appointments and 2)Understand patients' perceptions of gaps 3)Schedule follow up office visits with nurse or PCP to address needs and barriers Barrier to Control Patient Examples Health Literacy Lack of information about the potential consequences and treatments of hypertension interacted with other causal factors to decrease adherence. Intentional Nonadherence Side effects (increased urination) at times discouraged patients from taking the full dose. Patients preferred non -medication interventions. Unintentional Nonadherence Patients lost or had medications stolen and had not refilled prescriptions. Did not know follow up plan. Patient Care Access Limited patient availability did not always match up with provider availability in the next month. For providers on leave, patients were not prepared to engage with a new PCP. We asked patients: 1)As of your last primary care visit what is your plan for controllingyour blood pressure? How is itworking for you? 2)What medicines are you taking tocontrol your blood pressure? 3)What questions and concerns do you have about your blood pressure? Fig 2. Prioritized barriers to hypertension control identified qualitatively through intervention. Interprofessional collaboration --between students, clinicians, staff, and systems scientists --was crucial to identify and detail gaps that underlie healthcare disparities locally and across a population. African -Americans face barriers to accessing care for hypertension, and increased solicitation of concerns and follow -up by prov iders seems promising to overcome the identified gaps. Measurement of control rates (and other indicators) must include the full breadth of available patient data in the health rec ord.Fig 1.

Next Steps, Dissemination, & Lessons Learned 58Goal #1: Increase Awareness Next Steps: Continue to track the number of ViRx referrals per month for next several months. Analyze impact of ViRx through chart review of referred patients (PharmD/PCP notes, # of meds, etc). Review results of post-intervention survey of providers to assess changes in understanding and attitudes. Dissemination: Thus far, we have presented this project at the CA-HI Regional SGIM Conference (Jan 2018) and at the UCSF DGIM Research Symposium (May 2018). Results may provide support for the expansion of outpatient pharmacist collaborations beyond the ACO population and across the UCSF health system. Lessons Learned: Providers are enthusiastic about working with pharmacists in the primary care setting. Insurance payment is complicated; there is currently no time-efficient way for providers to access patient insurance provider/payor information to determine their eligibility for restricted programs. The need for outpatient pharmacist collaboration extends far beyond the currently eligible ACO population.Interprofessional outpatient pharmacist programs are increasing nationally, with studies indicating a number of benefits for patient care.1,2,3 At UCSF, a Virtual Pharmacist (ViRx) program was established in 2015: Telephonic approach for pharmacists to co-manage primary care accountable care organization (ACO) patients with medication related issues (e.g. medication reconciliation, education, cost, access). In June 2017, a \"Virtual Pharmacist Referral\" order was created in the electronic medical record (\"APEX\") to facilitate direct referrals from physicians to the ViRx. The visibility and adoption of the ViRx program within the Division of General Internal Medicine (DGIM) is unknown. Needs Assessment: Provider Survey Fifty-three of 111 DGIM providers (48%) completed an anonymous online survey: Understanding/Utilization of the ViRx Program 98% agreed that collaborations with pharmacists would be helpful in providing care 87% reported insufficient understanding of the ViRx program and its APEX referral Most Commonly Cited Barriers to Utilization: Lack of provider awareness about the program/its resources (47%) Difficulty identifying patients that qualify for ViRx (28%) Target Subpopulations* for ViRx Medication Management Support 1.Patients poor health literacy 2.Patients on 10+ medications 3.Elderly (65+) patients *respondents were allowed to indicate top 3 choices 1.

This appears to be due to: a)Overall low visibility of the program among DGIM providers, and b)Difficulty identifying patients whose insurance programs would qualify them for ViRx care. To address these limitations, we chose a multi-pronged intervention focused on: 1)Increasing provider awareness of the ViRx program 2)Simplifying identification of eligible insurance plans, and 3)Targeting populations that would most benefit from medication management support Overall, our goals are to: 1.Increase awareness of the ViRx program among DGIM providers 2.Increase utilization of the ViRx program, particularly among the high-risk ACO patient populationPre-Intervention (Jul - Nov 2017)Post-Intervention (Dec 2017 - May 2, 2018) ACO Pop. referrals2 6 Total referrals 14 31Intervention Timeline Intervention Goal #2: Increase Utilization The top 3 reasons for ViRx referrals: 1.Medication reconciliation 2.Medication recommendation 3.Cost assistance 1.Laminated flyer with ViRx educational materials and customized lists of each DGIM provider's ViRx-eligible, high-risk patients 2.Customized email for each provider with lists of ViRx-eligible, high-risk patients, including the age, number of medications, and upcoming appointment times 59The current Lakeshore hypertension registry includes 1,915 patients who have a recorded blood pressure in the last 12 months. Of these, 78.18% were at goal in the last 12 months. Despite implementation of a new hypertension control protocol in 2016, a significant number of Lakeshore's patients continue to have uncontrolled hypertension. Our goal is to increase the percentage of patients on Lakeshore's hypertension registry whose blood pressure is controlled by 4% (78.18% \u00e0 82%) by December 1, 2018. Control of hypertension is considered to be two consecutive measurements of blood pressure at or below patient's goal. Next Steps: We aim to enroll a greater number of patients in the home monitoring program to better evaluate the program's success, and if necessary, make appropriate changes to the program moving forward. We also plan to analyze demographic information in Lakeshore's hypertension database to identify new strategies for outreach and interventions. Dissemination: If success is observed in our pilot, the program will be publicized within the UCSF system beyond Lakeshore as an additional option for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients. Lessons Learned: Challenges toimplementation include variations inpatient insurance coverage forhome medical equipment, regulations limiting purchase and provision ofdurable medical equipment, and recruiting suitable candidates forhome monitoring and health coaching .Achieving adequate blood pressure control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension decreases the risk of long- term associated health problems. Hypertension raises risk of stroke, heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases. In the United States today, 1 in 3 adults, or 75 million people, have uncontrolled hypertension. As of 2012, 28.5% of adults in California (8 million) had uncontrolled hypertension. In 2013, Kaiser Northern CA implemented hypertension control protocols and saw blood pressure control among patients improve from 44% to 80% overall, surpassing national trends in the same time frame (55% to 63%). By implementing new protocols for hypertension control, Lakeshore aims to make similar improvements.The home monitoring and health coaching pilot program was launched in November of 2017. Two patients have been enrolled in the pilot to date. Of these, one has completed the program and achieved goal for BP control and one was lost to follow- up. One objective of the pilot program was to identify challenges in implementing home monitoring and lifestyle modification for patients. Major challenges identified to date include: Variation in insurance coverage: Some insurance plans cover provision of a home blood pressure monitoring cuff at no cost to patients, but many do not. Cuffs must be prescribed by a provider and obtained at a pharmacy. The pilot has focused on recruiting patients who carry insurance coverage that provide a cuff at no cost. Regulatory restrictions prevent the clinic from providing durable medical equipment directly to patients.Difficulty obtaining referrals: Providers in clinic were asked to identify appropriate patients who could be invited to participate in the program. Referrals have been generated by a small subset of providers.Patient refusal: Approximately half of patients invited to participate in the pilot program declined, citinglack of interest in health coaching or home monitoring. Efforts to identify and contact appropriate patients who are eligible for the pilot program continue. As additional patients are recruited into the program, we will have a clearer understanding of the impact of our intervention. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Home monitoring to improve blood pressure control Joseph Garcia, Nicholas Hanson, Sarah Peterson, Sarah GaleWyrick MD Lakeshore Family Medicine Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned In 2016, Bridges students surveyed a sample of patients on the Lakeshore hypertension registry about their concerns and preferences regarding management of their hypertension. Key findings included: 83% of patients would prefer to check their BP at home vs. visiting the clinic; however, only 42% would prefer home monitoring if they had to pay for their own BP cuff. 92% of patients reported they would be interested in talking to a clinic staff member or medical student about making lifestyle changes to improve their BP . 100% of patients reported they would be more likely to check their BP regularly at home if they knew they were going to get a follow -up call. When asked to consider potential barriers to monitoring their BP at home, patients' top concerns included \"learning to use the BP cuff,\" \"paying for the BP cuff\" and \"remembering to take my BP\". Based on this information, we developed two interventions: Develop and distribute a patient handout with information on lifestyle changes to improve hypertension control and a template that patients can use to record daily BP readings and develop and track progress on a SMART lifestyle goal. Pilot a home monitoring program for patients on the hypertension registry. Providers will identify candidates for home monitoring and who carry insurance that will cover a home BP cuff. Bridges students will invite patients to participate in this pilot program which includes 1:1 health coaching, setting a SMART lifestyle goal, instruction in use of a home BP cuff, and follow -up visits to assess progress toward lifestyle and BP control goals. 601.Explore the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation among the initial patients screened. 2.Understand provider attitudes and practices around discussing depression and suicidal ideation with patients. 3.Implement an intervention to increase conversations around depression and suicidal ideation when indicated.In the absence of universal depression screening, only 50% of patients with major depression are identified (1). Patient barriers to proactively discuss depression include fear of stigmatization and belief that depression is a \"personal flaw\" (2). Untreated depression increases risk of suicide (3). Up to 75% of patients who commit suicide were seen by a primary care provider within prior 30 days (4). At the University of California, San Francisco Division of General Internal Medicine (UCSF DGIM), a pilot for universal depression screening using the PHQ-9 was implemented on one floor on September 11, 2017. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Understanding and Improving Provider Conversations about Depression and Suicidality in an Academic Primary Care Setting Cecilia Im, MS11*, Blythe Butler Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, 2Division of General Internal Medicine, University of California, San Francisco *Contributed equally to the project Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned At check in Pt receives PHQ - 9 formMedical Assistant inputs antidepressant 3.Refer to Behavioral Health/Psych Figure 4.

Only 12% of charts haddetailed scores; providers mentioned time was wasted searching for detailed PHQ- 9. Without detailed PHQ -9, providers do not have contextfor +PHQ- 9 and +SI. Next Steps For our next PDSA cycle, we hope to create an intervention earlier in the workflow: If a patient indicates positive SI, the MA would add SI as a chief complaint. The onus would then be on the physician to delete or address the SI. DisseminationThis work has been presented at the CA/Hawaii Regional SGIM Conference (January 20, 2018) and the DGIM Research Symposium (May 2, 2018).In the future, we hope to share this work with other primary care settings at UCSF (China Basin, ZSFG, VA) and regional or national conferences for other academic primary care settings Lessons LearnedAlthough there was no significant improvement in the use of the . phqdetail dotphrase, other aspects of documentation around depression and SI improved.A breakdown in workflow occurred earlier than our intervention target, which may have negatively impacted theefficacy of our interventio n. We unexpectedly found that patients were significantly more likely to confirm SI with attendings rather than residents, which warrants further investigation.Thirty- two out of 56 providers (57%) completed the survey. Understanding Provider Attitudes 100% of providers indicated willingness to discuss SI if indicated.Attendings more likely to indicate comfort discussing depression and SI than residents (Figure 3).

We are currently at 57.5 % (green fill).Next Steps: Our next steps are two -fold: 1) Find ways to bridge the \"documentation gap\" for more comprehensive records in our EHR 2) Investigate methods to change the minds of patients who decline flu vaccines. Lakeshore had an unusually high rate of vaccine declination last year, and we want to be sure all of our patients are protected. Dissemination: Clinic -wide use of SmartPhrase reminders are a low effort way to increase awareness of Flu season and UCSF's ability to administer vaccines. Though it takes more effort, other sites could also implement the Saturday clinics and train medical students to administer vaccinations. Lessons Learned: Patients differ in how they want to be reminded to get their flu vaccines, but almost all value convenience when obtaining their vaccinations. Flu vaccines are a critical part of health initiatives to increase wellness, and a part of the Quality & Safety pillar of the UCSF True North plan. The rate of documentation of vaccination or denial thereof falls short of the target 46%. This is a measure of quality as decided by the Patient Centered Medical Home PRIME recognition requirements. Patients have reported receiving flu vaccinations in various settings, but because the documentation is not centralized, it cannot be verified. To ensure our patients are receiving adequate preventative care, we must be sure that they both receive the vaccination and have it documented for their provider to verify. In the 2016 -17 flu season, we were below average among primary care clinics at UCSF (37.2% of empaneled patients vaccinated at Lakeshore vs. 38.3% of empaneled patients) and were ranked 9th out of the 12 primary care clinics at UCSF. Annual flu impact, CDC (https://www.cdc.gov /) 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Increasing Flu Vaccination Rates at UCSF Lakeshore UCSF Lakeshore Claire Greene, Jacob Stultz, Colleen Carlston, Sarah Galewyrick Family Medicine Clinic Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned To increase the flu vaccination rates at Lakeshore we planned several efforts:(1)Administer a written questionnaire to patients receiving flu vaccines in order to understand their preferences for outreach reminders about flu vaccination. The responses helped us understand what measures were working well, as well as potential gaps in outreach that we relayed to upper management (e.g. text message reminders). Responses also helped us formulate the measures below. (2)We also gathered information from patients who were not yet vaccinated, and to understand their reasons for abstaining. We identified patients in APeX who had either never or inconsistently gotten flu vaccines in past years, and conducted phone interviews. These conversations helped identify patient barriers, as well as reinforce our hypothesis in the gap analysis that patients were likely getting flu vaccines elsewhere but not sharing this information with their PCPs. There was also the added benefit of counseling these patients and persuading some to receive their flu vaccine. (3)Based on feedback that patients wanted more opportunities to receive a flu shot, we organized a student -run flu vaccine clinic. This operated via appointment on Wednesday mornings of our CMC days, and a Saturday Walk -in clinic at Lakeshore. This improved access for patients who did not need a full annual exam, but wanted to receive the flu vaccine as part of health care maintenance. The Saturday clinic was especially important for young professionals and families, since many patients have difficulty attending during weekday hours because of work or school. (4)Patients wanted more reminders about flu vaccination, so we created an APeX Smartphrase for Lakeshore staff to use. With the help of our coach, we encouraged all staff to append the flu vaccine reminder at the bottom of any patient communications. This helped raise awareness of the need for vaccination, as well as publicize the flu clinics that Lakeshore has to offer. 0.00%10.00%20.00%30.00%40.00%50.00%60.00%70.00% Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar AprLAKESHORE FLU RATES PER MONTH Lakeshore 16-17 Lakeshore 17-18 Goal 622018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Project Title Francis Harrison, Shakkaura Kemet, and Marissa Silverman UCSF Medical Center: Floor 12, Moffitt Hospital Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Environmental factors: e.g. alarm sounds, light, noise in hallway Provider/system factors: e.g. vital sign checks, blood draws, medications Patient factors : e.g. electronic devices, missing family/friends, painIn an effort to better understand barriers to sleep in the hospital, a survey of 20 inpatients at UCSF Parnassus was conducted. 128 sleep disruptions across 17 different types of disruptions were identified. Most disruptions could be categorized as environmental factors (n=60), provider/system factors (n=44), or patient factors (n=24). UCSF Parnassus currently has resources that are not systematically being utilized to address environmental disruptions to sleep, including: white noise machines, sleep masks, and volunteers who can help implement future sleep promotion efforts. PROBLEM STATEMENT: In 2016, 20 inpatients were surveyed for sleep disruptions. Of the 128 sleep disruptions cited, 60 (47%) were environmental factors. This is incongruent with UCSF's current sleep promotion efforts, which are focused only on single interruptions at night such as vital sign checks, blood draws, and medication delivery. Time Goal Measure By May 2018 Sleep Promotion Program addresses environmental disruptions experienced by inpatients By September 2018, a mean 1 -point increase in self-rated sleep quality among patients before and after our interventionTARGET GOAL: To implement a Sleep Promotion Program by September 2018 that both 1) leads to a mean 1 -point increase in self -rated sleep quality among patients (measured on a 5 -point Likert scale) before and after our intervention, and 2) that ultimately aligns with UCSF Health's True North pillars to deliver an outstanding patient experience, achieve zero harm, continually improve patient care, lower costs, and create an optimal work experience. In order to better understand the problem of sleep at UCSF Medical Center, we interviewed patients and nurses on 15 Long. Our interviews unearthed several different contributors to creating an environment not conducive to sleep in the hospital, which fell into four categories (patient factors, provider factors, polic ies/work flow, and structure/environment). This data is displayed in the fish bone diagram. Of the various components presented in the fish bone diagram, we focused on structural/environmental factors because wedetermined they were the most feasible to modify. To further investigate structural/ environmental factors that contribute to an environment not conducive to sleep, we intervi ewed 7 nurses, 3 patient care assistants, 8 physicians, and 16 patients on 15 Long using the 5 Why's method to identify root causes. We found that white noise machines had been installed in patients room s on 15 Long to improve patient sleep, but a large barrier to their use was a lack of awareness about their existence by both patients and providers. We considered two interventions to address the gap we identified in our patient and provider surveys, and enable patients to sleep better in the hospital: 1) an awareness campaign to patient care providers about the in- room (installed) white noise machines that would drown out common background noise in the hospital (i.e.: alarms, staff conversation, nearby patients) and 2) a sleep kit that would include items that might address some of the environmental disruptions to sleep that we uncovered in our interviews suc h as ear plugs for noise, eye masks for light, herbal tea and crossword puzzles to highlight day and night cycles in the hospital by helping patients relax at bedtime. We chose to have the voluntee rs offer white noise machines and not an entire sleep kit for two reasons: 1) the white noise machines were readily available while the other supplies were not and 2) since the hospital may be investing in installing more in -room white noise machines on other units as the hospital renovates we believe that providing data on the utility of white noise machines specifically to be the most useful t o UCSF in terms of addressing the environmental disturbances we discovered in our gap analysis. We will implement a countermeasure in which Parnassus Hospital Volunteers -overseen by a clinical nurse champion -conduct evening rounds on patients on 12 Moffitt to offer them portable white noise machines and let them know that improving sleep in the hospital is a priority of UCSF Health. Volunteers will also admi nister a short baseline survey to patients about their sleep in the hospital. The next day, study team members will round on patients a second time and collect post -intervention survey data, asking patients how they were sleeping in the hospital prior to and after being offered a white noise machine. Study team members will analyze pre -and post -survey data to evaluate the effect of the white noise machi nes on sleep quality in the hospital, and determine the impact of the overall intervention. One complication we faced in developing this intervention is that 12 Moffitt is not a unit on which there are in -room white nois e machines, and so we used portable white noise machines for our first PDSA cycle. We considered rolling out the intervention on a floor that does have in -room white noise machines, but this would no t be feasible without a volunteer coordinator. WHAT WHO WHERE WHEN Volunteers need to be trained to administer the patient sleep pre -survey and teach patients how to use the white noise machineNurse Champion PW will train the volunteers, with the support of Volunteer Services 12 Moffitt of UCSF Parnassus Hospital May 2018 Volunteers need to be supervised on 12 Moffitt while they perform their rounds and collect pre -survey dataNurse Champion PW will supervise the volunteers, with the support of Volunteer Services 12 Moffitt of UCSF Parnassus Hospital May -June 2018 Study team members will collect post -survey data to evaluate the effect of the white noise machines on sleep qualityStudy team members FH, SK, and MS will collect the data 12 Moffitt of UCSF Parnassus Hospital May -June 2018 Study team members will analyze pre -and post-survey data to determine the impact of the intervention*Study team members FH, SK, and MS will analyze the data using Microsoft Excel 12 Moffitt of UCSF Parnassus Hospital June 2018 * Pre-survey measures include: 1) How well did you sleep at home before this hospital stay? 2) How have you been sleeping in the hospital? 3) What other items might help your sleep? Post -survey measures include: 1) Prior to being offered the white noise machine, how were you sleeping in the hospital? 2) How have you b eensleeping since using the white noise machine? 3) For how long did you use the white noise machine? 4) What time(s) of day did you use the white noise machine? 5) Did you use it for any re ason other than sleeping? We plan to track our progress in several ways, largely through the feedback options we have integrated into our pre -and post -intervention surveys. In the pre -intervention survey, there are two areas for feedback that we can study. First, we asked the inpatients what sleep -promoting items they would want (sleep mask, ear plugs, herbal tea, etc). The information from this will provide future direction regarding what sleep -promoting items ought to be offered while patients are hospitalized. Ideally, we would lik e to offer inpatients a sleep kit that includes all the items indicated from our pre -survey to maximize the likelihood that the kit enhances inpatients' sleep quality. Second, we included a space for volunteers to provide open -ended feedback for how they think we can improve our countermeasure. This data will be helpful for creating an experience that is more meaningful for the voluntee rs,and thus help ensure the longevity of the program. In the post -intervention survey, we assess patients' sleep quality using a Likert scale, with the goal of creating a mean shift of 1 point on a 5 -point Likert scale among patients describing their sleep quality in the hospital before and after our intervention. The post -intervention survey also allows for patients to provid e open -ended feedback and describe specifically how they used the white noise machine (e.g. What time of day did they use the white noise machine? For how long? Did they use it for any other reason than sleeping?). This patient -reported data will offer future insight into how patients are using the white noise machines and how we can improve our intervention to better enhance patien ts'sleep in the hospital. The overall hope is that the data collected from these pre -and post -surveys will be utilized by future QI teams. In the future, we would identify a clinical champion earlier on in the development process. Without this champion early on, w e experienced significant delays in implementing our interventionSleepless in San Francisco: Using Sleep Kits to Promote Inpatients' Sleep in the Hospital Acute sleep deprivation has tremendous physical and mental health consequences A recent survey done at the University of Chicago hospital found that the average inpatient sleeps 5.25 hours per night (Arora paper \"Awakenings\"). In comparison to this benchmark, UCSF's inpatients average 6 hours per night. Studies have shown that less than 7 hours of sleep at night increase a patient's risk for immune dysfunction (Arik Prather). Sleep deprivation is a key driver of delirium, which is linked to increased mortality, length of stay, falls, loss of independence, and discharge to a facility. Since Fall 2016, UCSF's Delirium Reduction Campaign has worked to prevent delirium, utilizing multiple efforts including sleep promotion. Most sleep improvement efforts focus on single interruptions at night such as vital signs, which does not reflect the importance of an environment conducive to sleep. Improving sleep in the hospital aligns with UCSF Health's True North pillars to deliver an outstanding patient experience, achieve zero harm, continually improve patient care, lower costs, and create an optimal work experience.Infographic created by HealthCentral 63Target Goals for Vaccination Status and ProvisionMultiple Sclerosis and Vaccinations Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the CNS that affects over 400,000 people in the US.1 Therapeutic immunosuppression is a widely used treatment for MS and other neuroinflammatory conditions. There is an emerging consensus that it is safe and compelling for immunocompromised patients, including those with MS, to receive inactivated and/or recombinant vaccines including influenza, pneumococcal and shingles.2,3,4 Current Conditions Prior to this project, the UCSF MS Clinic did not systematically or routinely record vaccination status or administer influenza, pneumococcal, or shingles vaccinations in clinic. The Clinic aims to be a national leader in promoting appropriate vaccinations for our immunocompromised patients. >90% of patients seen in MS clinic did not have vaccination status recorded in APeX based on a query from Oct 19, 2015 to Oct 16, 2017. Rationale Based on an APeX query, approximately 70% of MS clinic patients do not have a UCSF -affiliated primary care provider (PCP) and 19% do not have any PCP recorded in APeX. The majority of MS Clinic patients are covered by health plans that would most likely reimburse for vaccinations (63.3% private, 20.8% Medicare, and 8.8% Medicaid). Every patient encounter represents an opportunity to record vaccination status and offer in -clinic influenza, pneumococcal and/or shingles vaccination to eligible patients. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Influenza, Pneumococcal, and Shingles Vaccinations in MS and Neuroflammation Clinic Outpatients on Therapeutic Immunosuppression UCSF Medical Students: Heather Ma, Keith Sakata, PharmD Clinic Manager: Richard Falasco Neurologists: Ari Green, MD, MAS (Medical Director), Andrew Romeo, MD, Riley Bove, MD, Jeffrey M. Gelfand, MD, MAS FAAN* *On behalf of the UCSF MS Center Unit -Based Leadership Team **Acknowledgements and special thanks to UCSF Rheumatology, including Andrew Gross, MD and Darlene Lee, NP Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Gap Analysis: To identify the root causes, we conducted interviews with patients, clinicians, MAs, nurses, pharmacists, and administrative leadership within the UCSF MS Clinic. We also conducted a site visit to the UCSF Rheumatology Clinic to learn about their successful in -clinic vaccination efforts. Rationale: The extent of under -vaccination in MS Clinic patients cannot be determined without accurate recording. Based on the gap analysis and discussions with the UBLT and inter -disciplinary clinic team, MAs were identified as the best point of contact to c ollect this data since the MAs already triage and see each patient prior to the physician visit. Expected Outcome: Increased vaccination recording rates in APeX. Data will be analyzed at months 1 & 3 and then quarterly for auditing and feedback. Rationale: Many MS clinic patients on therapeutic immunosuppression do not have easy access to vaccinations, and mobility restrictions can be a major barrier due to neurological disease. Furthermore, over 70% of MS clinic patients receive primary care outside of the UCSF system. Providing vaccinations in -clinic will allow efficient patient access for vaccinations and improve patient safety. Expected Outcome: Increased vaccination rates. Data will be analyzed quarterly for auditing. UCSF Medical Center True North Benchmarks Current Target Continue to improve patient care: Increase rates of documentation of vaccination status in the MS Clinic as a structured variable in the vaccination record in APeX by July 2018 as measured by: 1. The percentage of clinic patients with up to date influenza vaccination status 8.5% 70% 2. The percentage of clinic patients with up to date pneumococcal vaccination status 6.6% 70% 3. The percentage of clinic patients with up to date shingles vaccination status 0% 70% Optimizing access and achieving zero harm: Launch a pilot in -clinic vaccination program by May 2018 to increase vaccination rates in eligible MS Clinic patients with full roll out and achievement of target goals by March 2019 as measured by: 4. The percentage of eligible clinic patients who receive an influenza vaccine in clinic during the 2018 flu season0% 50% 5. The percentage of eligible clinic patients who receive a pneumococcal vaccine in clinic by March 20190% 50% 5. The percentage of eligible clinic patients who receive a pneumococcal vaccine in clinic by March 20190% 50%Illness Hospitalization Death Risk Reduction Influenza5 9.2 10,000-40,000 96 97.2 Vaccination Received Yes NoNot N (%) 146 (5.9%) 65 (2.6%) (93.4%)Countermeasure 1 to Improve Recording of Vaccination Status: MAs will ask all patients checking in for visits in MS Clinic about their influenza, pneumococcal, and shingles vaccination status and record vaccination status in APeX under the vaccination tab. Countermeasure 2 to Vaccinate in Specialty Clinic: Establish a system to prescribe and, when able, administer influenza, pneumococcal, and shingles vaccinations in the MS Clinic. This also includes developing a clinic consensus about vaccination recommendations for this immunosuppressed neurological patient population. Physicians will offer, counsel, and place an order for eligible patients who wish to proceed vaccination(s) in -clinic or prescribe vaccination(s) as part of the clinic visit. MS Clinic nurses will administer the ordered vaccine(s) in clinic. Next Steps Pilot vaccine provision in clinic Revise vaccination protocol with physician, nurse, and MA feedback Conduct patient and provider education campaign using unified 'Vax Pack' branding Implement clinic -wide rollout DisseminationPresent in November 2018 at CMC HIS Poster Symposium Present results of program, along with quarterly updates, to clinic staff after clinic -wide rollout Document/disseminate experience to broader MS community via manuscript and/or presentation at upcoming national conference. Lessons Learned Attention/support is increasingly given to vaccinations within specialty clinics at UCSF \u2014this needs to become more of a priority especially in clinics that work with immunocompromised patients. Significant logistical and IT challenges exist to vaccine recording and administration within specialty clinics and integrati on with primarily care within the system can be improved.

Percent without Vaccination Status RecordingImpact of Vaccination on Health 64Our goal is to implement changes that will reduce the stress of the caregiving experience and improve caregivers' understanding that their wellness is important for LTRs outcomes, thereby improving the overall patient experience. Our survey of UCSF LTR Caregivers indicated that 68% were stressed by the weight of being primarily responsible for their loved one, 43% found it difficult to find time to relax and unwind while caring for their loved one, and 37% stated they sometimes neglect their own health needs to fully care for their loved one. This fishbone gap analysis diagram was produced to document the numerous ways caregivers become stressed throughout their LTR's transplant process. Our survey also indicated that caregivers want more transplant/recovery education. Nursing coordinators at UCSF Lung Transplant noted that caregivers do receive a lot of information, but most of that comes in a very short time period. During the immediate post -lung transplant period, caregivers are inundated with a significant amount of information at once, which we believe is contributing to caregiver stress. During the waitlist period, however, patients and caregivers do not receive too much information to prepare them for life post -transplant. This seems like a great window during which to prepare the caregivers. In addition, traditional post - transplant materials produced have been patient -centered. This packet of information is called the \"Blue Binder.\"Next Steps: We will continue to distribute caregiver- centered blue binders to caregivers at the time of listing. We will gather caregiver fe edback about the new binders, and will resend out the original caregiver survey and chart the percentage of caregivers who report finding the care giver experience stressful, and the percentage of caregivers who understand that their wellness as the caregiver will lead to better survival outcomes for their respective lung transplant recipients. Dissemination: Our work provides an example of modifying patient education materials to improve patient care. Caregiver wellness is an often less emphasized portion of patient care. Other UCSF Health departments could begin looking at their patient education materials and modifying them when appropriate to include the caregivers in the conversation of patient care. Lessons Learned: The caregiver -centered packet, along with tips, was crafted in Microsoft Word. It was an unexpected challenge to format the tips in a way that was not too complicated so that edits could easily be made, should the contents of the blue -binder or caregiver tips be changed in the future. Most importantly, none of this project's work could have been completed without the guidance, feedback, and help of UCSF Lung Transplant's interdisciplinary team. We worked with social workers, pre and post -transplant nurse coordinators, pharmacists, nurse practition ers, and physicians.Lung transplantation has become an important therapeutic option for patients with advanced lung disease, primarily to extend survival and improve health -related quality of life (HRQOL) of the lung transplant recipient (LTR). There were 2327 lung transplants done in the United States in 2016, including 68 at UCSF. Undergoing a lung transplant is a complex process. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) requires that all LTRs have a caregiver identified who will assist with the post -transplant management. The post -lung transplant period is an extremely stressful process for both LTRs and their caregivers. Caring for a LTR requires administering up to 35 medications, around 4 times a day, every day and keeping a strict hygiene regimen, as well as offering emotional and psychosocial support to the LTR, despite the caregiver likely having no prior experience. Over the past year, the UCSF lung transplant team has increasingly realized the importance of the caregiver in the outcome of the LTR and the effects of caregiver burnout. One attempt to lower caregiver stress levels was providing caregivers with a gift bag containing local resources and some supplies. While the Caregiver Bag Project was appreciated, feedback from caregivers has indicated a need for more emotional and psychosocial support. In 2017, 80% of caregivers for UCSF LTRs reported being a caregiver is a stressful experience and this contributes to the overall patient experience. In addition, caregiver burnout resulted in the re -hospitalization of 2 of the 68 patients who underwent lung transplant in 2016. Thus, to improve in the UCSF True North Goals related to improving the patient experience and reducing costs, the UCSF Lung Transplant team must identify ways to reduce caregiver stress levels and improve caregivers' understanding of the effect of their own wellness on the outcomes of LTRs. 80% of caregivers for lung transplant recipients transplanted at UCSF in the past 5 years report being a caregiver as a stressful experience and 72% believe that their own wellness will affect the transplant recipient's outcome. Too many caregivers for UCSF LTRs are finding the caregiving experience to be stressful and this has potential to affect the overall patient experience. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Reducing Stress and Improving Understanding of Wellness in Post Lung Transplant Caregivers Geena Zhou (MS1), Zane Hellmann (MS1), Lorriana Leard (MD ) UCSF Lung Transplant Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned This project would aim to improve the pre/post -transplant education offered to caregivers by providing caregivers with their own version of the \"Blue Binder\" with annotated comments tailored to caregivers. Packet will be given to the caregiver at the time of patient listing for lung transplant . This will give caregivers more time to better understand the important role they will play for their patient should their loved one receive a transplant. Among these helpful caregiver tips are mindfulness reduction techniques and other stress -relieving techniques to enable caregiver awareness about the importance of their own wellbeing. Additional emphasis on the caregiver will reinforce UCSF Lung Transplant's dedication to caregiver wellbeing which will improve patient experience. Plans:Develop the new caregiver -centered \"blue binder\" packets Send them to the RN coordinator for printing and distribution to patients' caregivers at the time of listing for lung transplant. Online versions of the caregiver -centered \"blue binder\" packets will be emailed to any secondary caregivers or caregivers not present at the time of listing. This is an example of the type of caregiver centered materials we are planning to give in conjunction with the regular \"blue binder\" materials that are now given when a patient is put on the waiting list for a lung transplant. Rather than try and write a completely separate binder, we felt that an annotated version of the current \"blue binder\" materials would cause the least confusion for the caregivers, while still providing them the most amount of information that they need in order to both properly care for their recipient as well as themselves. These materials have already begun to be reviewed by: Members of the UCSF Lung Transplant team Experienced caregivers of lung transplant recipients . 65Clinic wait times cause dissatisfaction among patients and their families atUCSF Mt.Zion Pediatric Primary Care Clinic (MZPPCC) .InFY 2017, only 86.7%ofpatient families reported that they would recommend MZPPCC to others .This isbelow the clinic's True North goal of88.2%.These scores the21stpercentile nationally and inthe38th percentile inCalifornia .Inthesame surveys, time was identified ofpatient dissatisfaction .

Our second goal is to increase the number of patients who know how to safely dispose of unused pain medications by 10% by September 2018. These targets align with UCSF's True North goals of resource management and patient safety. Our outcomes will be measured by a second administration of the patient survey following our intervention.Next Steps: Continue to assess the impact or our intervention by collecting more patient surveys Develop a graphic or video to accompany the discharge notes in order achieve better patient education Distribute envelopes for the mail -back of safe medication disposal to all patients upon discharge Translate education information on safe disposal to other languages Dissemination: Other surgical services at UCSF, including colorectal surgery, use Enhanced Recovery Pathways to optimize patient care. Such services could benefit from using a similar dot phrase to increase patient education on safe disposal, as well as implementing a similar suggested dose of opioids for post -operative pain management. Lessons Learned: Our initial goal was to increase post -operative multimodal analgesia. After a lot of data analysis we realized that 85% of patients were already receiving multimodal analgesia and that there was not much we could do to improve this. We learned that before we begin working towards an intervention we need to first establish the current conditions and ensure that the data robustly support the existence of a \"gap\" that we can improve.The over -prescription of opioids has led to a national opioid epidemic. Every year, 12.5 million people misuse prescription opioids, and 2 million develop a prescription opioid use disorder. Since 2014, the UCSF Gynecology Oncology department has used an Enhanced Recovery Pathway to increase multimodal analgesia prescriptions. A study conducted at the University of Michigan found that 33.33 oral morphine equivalents (OME) of opioids were sufficient for outpatient pain - management after minimally invasive surgery. In addition, it is unclear if patients receiving Gynecology Oncology surgery at UCSF know how to safely dispose of unused opioids. We assessed current opioid prescription habits and patient awareness of safe opioid disposal by creating and administering a survey to patients between January and March of 2018 who had undergone minimally invasive Gynecology Oncology surgery at UCSF. We also reviewed patient charts to quantify the amount of opioids they were prescribed. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Post-Operative Outpatient Opioid Prescription and Disposal After Minimally Invasive Gynecology Surgery Nichols, Smrithi Odinakachukwu Ehie, MD Lee-may Chen, MD Lee-lynn Chen, MD Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned This fishbone analysis was formed based on the results of a survey created and administered to 7 Gynecology Oncology providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and nurses. Based on these results we began the following interventions on 4/3/18: 1.Creation of a dot phrase that included post -operative patient discharge instructions regarding how to safely dispose of unused opioid medication, including information regarding disposal kiosks and mail -back programs 2.Creation and distribution of flyers in post -operative discharge areas to encourage providers to use dot phrase 3.Standardize the suggested prescription of oxycodone in the Enhanced Recovery Pathway to 20 pills oxycodone, 5mg (66.66 OME) 4.Assess quality of pain management in patient survey to ensure that the decrease in opioid prescription would not compromise pain management Average OME PrescribedSelf Reported Quantity PrescribedKnowledge Safe Disposal Pre-Intervention w/o Hx of 0%N/A Pre-Intervention 13%46% Post Intervention w/o management (n = 5) 54.17More: 80% Enough: 20%60% Average OME prescribed decreased by 25% after the intervention Knowledge of safe disposal increased by 30% after the intervention Post-intervention patients surveyed reported pain was well controlled, quantified pain control as 4.8/5 Self reported quantity prescribed amongst those without chronic pain medication use has increased by 3%, despite the decrease in overall quantity of medication prescribed Patients with past history of chronic pain management were prescribed more opioids and were more likely to report that they not prescribed enough pain medication 67Countermeasures Not Employed Scramble Patient Health Information (PHI) (Sutter) -Automated PHI recombination Con(s): Non -realistic patients (i.e. 5 y/o with heart failure), chance of PHI breach De-Identify PHI (Kaiser) -Manual removal of all identifying information from patient data Con(s): Very laborious, chance of PHI breach Pre-made environment (App Orchard) - Generic test environment and patients Con(s): Environment does not match UCSF \u00e0potential problems in PRD Pre-made test patients (Synthea ) -Pre-made patients imported into ACE6 Con(s): Importing to ACE6 would require infrastructure that is currently not available Countermeasures Employed In-House test Patients (UCSF) - UCSF employee or students create simulated patient population Pro(s): Realistic patient data customized to UCSF, mimics PRD, no risk of PHI breach Con(s): Labor intensive and costly to institution Justification for Decision Each countermeasure provide a bulk of test patient data In house creation provides best cost -benefit Most streamlined application development;

Screening for pediatric delirium will enhance care by quantifying the scope of the problem and providing valuable data to help staff design interventions to prevent and treat this serious condition. To this end, we aim for daily screening with the CAPD tool via the electronic medical record for 60% of PICU patients by December 2018. This will enable clinicians to identify patients at high risk for delirium and develop a care strategy, allow the unit to implement standard delirium prevention procedures and measure their effect, decrease costs, and improve outcomes. This goal is aligned with the True North Pillars of Quality and Safety and Patient Experience, because identifying and treating delirium will continually improve patient care and the hospital experience for patients and families. We also aim to bridge the current knowledge gap by increasing education and training for physicians, nurses, and other pediatric care providers. Next Steps: Our goal is to have systematic delirium screening using the CAPD implemented in the electronic medical record. This is in progress, and we aim for daily screening with the CAPD tool via the electronic medical record for 60% of PICU patients by December 2018. Dissemination: We believe this improvement work could be directly implemented in additional units of the hospital, such as the Transitional Care Unit, as well as other sites, such as UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland. Lessons Learned: We learned about the importance of interprofessional collaboration and continuing education. Our discussions with the nursing staff highlighted key issues with the EMR implementation, provided constructive feedback about some of our proposed plans, and emphasized the staff's interest in continuing education to improve patient care. Delirium is a behavioral manifestation of acute cerebral dysfunction associated with serious medical illness. It is frequently associated with changes in activity level, sleep impairment, and emotional disturbances. Delirium has multiple subtypes, making it especially difficult to identify in the hospital setting. Nationally, the prevalence of delirium in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) is estimated to be 25%. At UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, a retrospective chart review showed that a delirium diagnosis was included in fewer than 2% of problem lists. The true prevalence is unknown, because there is currently no systematic screening protocol in place. Pediatric delirium is associated with increases in length of PICU stay, length of hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, costs, and mortality. Specifically, pediatric delirium is associated with an increase in PICU stay by 2.3 days and a $14,029 increase in median total PICU costs per patient. UCSF has successfully implemented delirium prevention projects in adult ICU and hospital wards. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Delirium Screening in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Iris Liu, Kyle Roter, Mary Turocy Deborah Franzon, MD University of California, San Francisco Department of Pediatrics Division of Critical Care Background Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Preliminary screening of a convenience sample of 50 patients in the TCU and PICU over 4 months resulted in 13 positive screens, or scores greater than 9, indicating risk of delirium. This suggests a delirium prevalence of approximately 26%, consistent with the prevalence of delirium in critically ill children in the literature of 25%. To address the lack of education and discussion about delirium among the PICU nursing staff, we presented the results of our pilot screening and conducted an educational session about pediatric delirium at a PICU nursing staff meeting. Before the meeting, we administered a short 10-item survey to assess knowledge of delirium and attitudes toward delirium screening in the PICU, and collected 26 responses. The presentation was approximately 15 minutes long and included interactive discussion about benefits of screening, methods of delirium prevention and treatment. Collection of post-intervention survey data is ongoing. In order to better understand the prevalence of pediatric delirium in the PICU, we conducted a preliminary screening using the Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD). The CAPD is a validated rapid screening tool for pediatric delirium with high sensitivity and specificity that takes approximately 2 minutes to administer. The nurse completes the tool independently based on his or her interactions with the patient during the course of the shift, and interaction with the patient or family is not required. Preliminary screening of a convenience sample of 50 patients in the TCU and PICU over 4 months resulted in 13 positive screens, or scores greater than 9, indicating risk of delirium. This suggests a delirium prevalence of approximately 26%, consistent with the prevalence of delirium in critically ill children in the literature of 25% and significantly higher than the 2% rate of delirium documented in PICU problem lists. This discrepancy reflects the urgent need for the implementation of a tool to regularly screen and identify patients at risk for delirium and to establish a plan for delirium prevention and treatment. Based on the pre-survey administered to 26 PICU nurses at the delirium education session, nurses are only moderately confident in accurately identifying patients with pediatric delirium (34% somewhat agree, 27% somewhat disagree, 23% neither agree nor disagree). This was supported by our knowledge assessment questions, with only 27% correctly identifying the prevalence of pediatric delirium in critically ill children, and 50% or more of respondents failing to recognize age <2 years, mechanical ventilation and anti-epileptic medications as risk factors for pediatric delirium. Encouragingly, there was strong support among nursing staff for adding systematic delirium screening to the PICU workflow. Among surveyed nurses, 92% agreed or strongly agreed that delirium screening would provide valuable information to improve patient care, and 88% agreed or strongly agreed that improving recognition, management and prevention of delirium would increase their work satisfaction. We are able to accurately identify patients with delirium in the PICU Systematic delirium screening in the PICU will provide valuable information to improve patient care 69Our goal of improving hospital length of stay and decreasing time to post -operative ambulation aligns with the hospital's true north pillars of lowering hospital costs, improving quality and safety, and enhancing patient experience. From October 2016 to September 2017, 37.34% of patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery in the Gynecology -Oncology service at UCSF Mission Bay received multimodal analgesics (acetaminophen, gabapentin, and diclofenac). The aim of our study is to reduce hospital length of stay and post -operative time to ambulation by 5% in order to lower hospital costs, improve quality and safety, and enhance patient experience. We plan to evaluate and improve compliance with the preoperative components of the ERAS pathway in the Gynecology -Oncology service at UCSF Mission Bay from December 2017 to September 2018. Using the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), we will monitor compliance with multimodal analgesics and carbohydrate loading We will continue analyzing compliance on a monthly basis in order to determine whether compliance improves post -feedback. Based on those findings, we will then determine whether or not additional measures should be taken \u2014e.g., implementing training sessions for physicians to refine medication order sets or facilitating a meeting with the nurses staff to establish finite documentation protocols. Once we finish our data collection and analysis, we hope to then share our findings with the larger UCSF community in hopes of increasing compliance with the ERAS pathway in other surgical services.Through this experience, we learned that communication must be standardized in order to maintain efficiency and ensure compliance.According to the Electronic Health Record, from October 2015 to January 2018, 30% of patients were reported having taken boost breeze, 2% of patients were reporting having substituted boost breeze with Gatorade, and 1% of patients were reporting having substituted boost breeze with a beverage other than Gatorade. However, for 67% of patients, there were no records indicating whether or not boost breeze was taken or if it was substituted for another beverage. Once Apex was updated with a modality to improve boost breeze documentation in February 2018, 43% of patients were reported having taken boost breeze, 2% of patients were reporting having substituted boost breeze with Gatorade, and 3% of patients were reporting having substituted boost breeze with a beverage other than Gatorade. However, for 44% of patients, there were no records indicating whether or not boost breeze was taken or if it was substituted for another beverage. In April 2018, 68% of patients were reported having taken boost breeze, 5% of patients were reporting having substituted boost breeze with Gatorade, 8% of patients were reported having not taken boost breeze or a substitute, and 3% of patients were reporting having substituted boost breeze with a beverage other than Gatorade. However, for 16% patients, there were no records indicating whether or not boost breeze was taken or if it was substituted for another beverage. On May 1, staff were provided with feedback regarding these findings. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Pre-Operative Enhanced Recovery Pathways in Minimally Invasive M.D., Lee-Lynn Chen, M.D. UCSF Gynecology -Oncology Service Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned In order to determine effective interventions, we performed a gap analysis using the \"5 Why's\" method. Based on our findings, we implemented two interventions. Our first intervention is a modality in the Electronic Health Record (Apex) that allows medica l staff to accurately document whether or not patients are boost breeze compliant. Our second intervention requires reporting the documentation findings back to medical staff in order to improve documentation compliance. By creating a robust and simplistic way of tracking boost breeze compliance, we hope to increase boost breeze documentation b y medical staff. In addition, we hope to better understand the reasons why non -compliant patients may choose to not take boost breeze. From October 2016 to September 2017, in the Gynecology -Oncology service at UCSF Mission Bay, the average hospital length of stay and the average time to mobility for patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery was 50.16 -hours and 10.26 -hours, respectively. Enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) are strategies to optimize the management of surgical patients by lowering the days patients spend in hospitals and accelerating patient recovery. In the Gynecology -Oncology service at UCSF Mission Bay, research showed that compliance with the pre-operative components of an enhanced recovery pathway (e.g., pre -procedural carbohydrate loading and administration of acetaminophen, gabapentin, and diclofenac) decreased hospital length of stay by 11.8% (Chapman et al., 2016). Additionally, only 47.15% of this patient population had carbohydrate loading prior to surgery. 43% 2% 8%44%3%Boost Breeze Compliance from February 2018 to March 2018 Taken Gatorade Not Taken Not documented Other30% 2% 67%1%Boost Breeze Compliance from October 2015 to January 2018 Taken Gatorade Not documented Other 68%5%8%16%3%Boost Breeze Compliance in April 2018 Taken Gatorade Not Taken Not documented Other 70 #UCSFHealthImprove2018 Posters for Session 2 5:30- 6:45p Lessons Learned: Patients value the opportunity to address their cancer survivorship needs with an integrated, interdisciplinary team of provider s Supportive care screenings, such as the Athena questionnaire, allow for enhanced recognition of and referrals for patients wh o benefit from survivorship- oriented supportive services, and, who might not otherwise self -refer or be referred for such services As only 18% of referrals are derived directly from medical and oncology clinics, further investigation is warranted to hone identification of patients approaching end of active treatment and to automate referrals to survivorship -oriented supportive services Next Steps: Survivorship Wellness will continue offering services to cancer survivors, post -active treatment, into the coming year New programmatic elements include an expanded curriculum, manual, and patient materials for program alumni for monthly class series on survivorship topics, scheduled to launch June 2018.

Lessons Learned: -Incidence of MDROs and other pathogens of interest have varied over time -Trends are pathogen specific -Real -time surveillance for MDROs is essential and serves as a foundation for efforts aimed at preventing the spread of antibiotic resistanceThe division of Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control (HEIC) produces an annual pathogen report that summarizes endemic and resistant organisms in our Medical Center. This report is a retrospective look at trends of these featured organisms including multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs). A limitation of this report is that it is not timely and thus not actionable. Historically, the report has included: -Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus added: -Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriacae (CRE) -Extended spectrum beta lactamase resistant gram negative organisms (ESBL) -Expanded spectrum of respiratory pathogens 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Multi-Drug Resistant Pathogen Report Kim Stanley, Laurel Gibbs, Sylvie Faisant Hospital Epidemiology & Infection Control Data Management Unit Background Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Phase I Determine appropriate formatting of underlying relational database tables to accommodate user defined report specifications. Pathogen table created that includes all positive cultures and antibiotic susceptibilities, refreshed daily. Utilize additional tables in database to incorporate C. difficile and respiratory pathogen tests. Define multi- drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a new addition to the report. Create and/or revise queries to extract organism data such that all fields of interest are identified as associated with each isolate. For multidrug resistant organisms ( MDROs ) limit to first isolate per patient per organism per year. Optimize various data displays to best convey data. Phase II Obtain feedback to guide enhancement of displays and performance. Incorporate additional analyses (e.g. control charts, antibiotic utilization). Work with partners to establish frequency and method for dissemination. Tableau software is an intuitive tool that allows creation of analysis and data displays based on user -defined interest; it was used to achieve the following project goals: Our goals were to: -Utilize this software to link to our relational database providing current laboratory data-Create an interactive data display tool -Develop capabilities to select time frame and unit -Examine pathogens by anatomic source and infection type-Identify trends, in real time, in order to facilitate timely investigations and identification of new priorities-Use this data to create a safer patient environment!Phase I of the project has just been completed and we are entering into Phase II. We are now focusing on making refinements and gathering feedback. Once that is complete we will utilize this real time report for HEIC monitoring of MDRO pathogens and establish a method of distribution for interested units and service lines. Users can refine analysis by hospital onset status, test type/result, culture source, and unit Users can refine analysis to resistance of certain drug classesEpidemiologically significant pathogens can be closely monitored Overall and adult vs. pediatric hospital onset rates monitored monthly 75Overall Goal: BPCI's goal is to provide the highest quality care to high- risk patients following surgery (who are more vulnerable after being discharged from the hospital) by providing the necessary support, education, coordination and resources, in order to improve their health outcomes and satisfaction with the UCSF experience, while reducing the per capita cost of care -the Financial Strength Pillar . Specific Goals: Improvement of Patient Experience Reduction in Readmission Rate Reduction in ED visit rate Reduction in Post- Acute Skilled Nursing Facility and Acute Rehab discharge Reduction in Skilled Nursing Facility and Acute Rehab Length of StayNext Steps:BPCI Model 2 is ending September 30 th2018. We submitted an application to CMS to participate in the next iteration of this program, BPCI -Advanced. We may participate in 3 other potential areas: Cardiac, Major Bowel, and Spine (Ortho/Neuro). If so, we will apply our lessons learned from previous BPCI models. Lessons Learned: Having a dedicated staff member to both manage a program and coordinate patient care is valuable and ensures consistent progress. Patient engagement and building relationships with Post -Acute Care facilities is crucial for ensuring success in alternative payment models. Robust analytics are important to engage providers and to track progress on a daily basis Engaging faculty is a good way to ensure that staff in a particular unit will have buy- in to a new workflow. Background The Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative was developed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test innovative payment and service delivery models that have the potential to reduce expenditures while preserving or enhancing the quality of care for beneficiaries. Traditionally, Medicare makes separate payments to providers for each of the individual services they furnish to beneficiaries for a single illness or course of treatment. This approach can result in fragmented care with minimal coordination across providers and health care settings. Payment rewards the quantity of services offered by providers rather than the quality of care provided. In July 2015, UCSF started BPCI model 2, a retrospective bundled payment arrangement where actual expenditures are reconciled against a target price for an episode of care. In this current model, the episode includes the inpatient stay in an acute care hospital, the post -acute care, and all related services up to 90 days after hospital discharge for Major Joint Replacement of the Lower Extremity.Per Capita Cost Bundled Savings: We have achieved consistent savings by spending less on 90 day patient episodes than the projected targets from CMS. See the Fiscal Performance Summary: a total of over $ 2.1 million in savings to date. Between Q32015 to Q22017, the percentage of OBP patients using SNF has reduced from 31% to 24%. Inpatient Rehab has reduced from 19% of cases to 8% of cases in Q22017. Internal Cost savings from a reduction in average Anchor Length of Stay from 3.49 days to 2.32 days between Q32015 and Q22017 Population Health Compared to the Baseline of 2009 to 2012, reduced readmissions from 12% to 8% in FY2017. Experience of Care Patient Satisfaction improved between FY2016 and FY2017 on multiple HCAHPS items such as Helpful with Pain Management increasing from 72.3% in FY16 to 87% in FY17. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Bundled Payments for Care Improvement: Orthopedic Arthroplasty Office of Population Health and Accountable Care Robin Andersen, Matt Callahan, Gina Intinarelli, Chiara Kuryan, Molly Shane, Stephanie Rogers, and Derek Ward Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned R\u00b2 = 0.6557 0.001.002.003.004.005.006.00 Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2Q3Q4Q1Q2 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2015 2017Baseline FY10-FY12 Experience CY14 Q1-Q3 Performance FY16-FY17Anchor Admit ALOSAverage Length of Stay for the Anchor Admit by QuarterR\u00b2 = 0.0573 of Patients using Post Acute Care Services Home Health Care Skilled Nursing Facility IP Rehab ReadmissionsIn order to improve care quality, patient experience, and reduce per capita cost, we monitored patients throughout their 90 day episode to track recovery and ensure appropriate care.

New workflow working well. Patient Experience Patient Surveys and Narrative Medicine Project 2 patients surveyed at HL 77Due to the lack of a sustainable quality and process improvement system in UCSF Center for Geriatric Care, we primarily aim to achieve the following by June 2018: 1.Create a sustainable system in which all members of the practice participate in quality and process improvement efforts to improve the care of our patients. 2.Create a workflow protocol that guide each member of the practice through relevant quality measures for our patients. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that patients make informed decisions regarding age - appropriate and patient -centered preventative measures (e.g. influenza vacation and pneumonia vaccinations), cancer screenings (e.g. breast and colorectal), and prevention of disease complications (e.g. diabetes).Next Steps: Focus more on inreach, which will reduce burden for outreach Coordinate among MA and LVN to find administrative time for inreach Work with APEX to optimize workflow Dissemination: -Potentially for family medicine practice/primary care Lessons Learned: -Improving rates of vaccination, cancer screening, and disease complication is possible with multifaceted approach. -Utilization of APEX smart set improves inreach effort and clinical flow. -This new model for inreach and outreach promote collaboration among all team members in the practice.UCSF Center for Geriatric CarePatient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) for adults 70+ Strives to promote successful aging Prevention of diseases and complications of chronic diseases Medical assistants (MA) and licensed vocational nurse (LVN) have been champions for quality improvements by ensuring all patients in the practice meet PCMH quality goals. The challenges have been meeting quality goals while managing multiple competing tasks for patient care. This led to months of lapses in patient outreach for quality goals from 2016 to 2017. These lapses led to downward trend or lower rate of multiple quality measure.Tobacco screening and cessation Breast cancer screening Colorectal cancer screening Timely hemoglobin A1C for patients with diabetes Timely influenza vaccine 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium New Model of Inreach and Outreach for Geriatrics Primary Care Carrie Kawamoto, Gloria Rodriguez - Campos, Noelle Murray, Brenda Gonzalez, Daniel Pound, Elizabeth Bauer, Xueni Zhong, Pei Chen UCSF Center for Geriatric Care Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Create a protocol for inreach and outreach of quality measures.

ACP outreach needs to build processes to assist patients who have cognitive impairment but still have capacity, and to engage patients who consider ACP as a lower priority in their care.ACP is especially relevant for older adults. We aim to further improve patient care by initiating conversation on ACP and assisting patients in our practice (UCSF Center for Geriatric Care) in completing AHCD. At baseline, 85 % of Public Hospital Redesign and Incentives in Medi -Cal (PRIME) patients in our practice had ACP documentation, specifically AHCD. The goal of this project is to increase the ACP documentation to 91% of our PRIME population by June 30, 2018. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Advance Care Planning in Outpatient Geriatric Primary Care Samuel Yee, Michele Sharma, MSW, Carolyn Welty, MD, Daniel Pound, MD, Pei Chen, MD UCSF Center for Geriatric Care Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Advance care planning (ACP) is a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health in understanding and sharing their values, goals, and preferences about future medical care. An advance health care directive (AHCD) is an aspect of ACP and a legal document that specifies an individual's power of attorney for health care and his/her values, goals, and preferences for care. Benefits of ACP: Ensure care that is consistent with preferences Provide clear instruction for surrogate decision maker and medical providers Ease the burden on the surrogate decision maker Reduce intensive treatment at end of life Increase utilization of hospice Only about 1/3 of adults the United States have completed some ACP.Barriers to Complete ACP Interventions Standardize workflow Hold in -service for providers to improve consistent documentation Delegate tasks to complete ACP: PCP, social work, medical assistants, practice coordinators Set up separate appointment with social work Set up appointment for ACP on days when the notary is on site Refer patients needing more assistance to Medical Legal Partnership for Seniors (MLPS) through UC -Hastings College of the Law 33%84%91% 20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%ACP Completion National Baseline Baseline (Aug 2017) Goal (Jun 2018)84.10%85.56% 82%83%84%85%86%87%PRIME AHCD Completion Aug In Process** (22) Verbal Confirmation: Will Complete (42) Other*** (39) Declined (12)*= number of patient lacking AHCD at start of year ** = contacted by telephone and/or mailed AHCD form*** = no response from patient, lack of capacity, or changed PCPPatient Primary Care Provider (PCP)Clinic/Logistics Lack of ACP APEXUnawareness Cultural beliefs Religious beliefs Language barrier Lack of surrogateLack of notary Lack of workflow Inadequate appointment time Limited access to PCP appointment Lack of ACP form in patients' languages Multiple competing tasks Low priority Inconsistent documentationMultiple places for documentation Incorrectly scanned ACP documentLow priority Low motivation Lack of trust Lack of witnessesLimited staff support ACP: AHCD Flowchart 79Next Steps: TMPy can be used to further analyze the RBC transfusion appropriateness beyond the initial screening based on pre -transfusion Hb. TMPy can be used to further analyze the appropriateness of other blood product (fresh frozen plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate) orders. Hospital unit -, specialty or provider- specific blood utilization data may be derived providing meaningful benchmarks for clinical services. Specific opportunities for practice improvement can be identified by various services.. Dissemination : TMPy use is adaptable to analyst's needs, which makes it potentially much more impactful as more blood utilization UCSF champions are emerging. This can potentially involve services other than Transfusion Medicine, and lead interdisciplinary quality improvement projects aimed at better transfusion practice campuswide . TMPy has the potential to become a self standing blood utilization tool beyond UCSF and UC. Lessons Learned: We learned about the value of teamwork and tapping into the tremendous talent of UCSF people.Transfusion Medicine (TM) services are required by regulatory agencies to monitor appropriateness of blood transfusion orders. Overtransfusion and non- compliance with accepted guidelines places the patients at unnecessary risk of transfusion. Blood transfusions have potentially fatal risks that have to be carefully pondered when placing an order. TM service oversight of transfusion practice may be challenging due to multiple reasons, mostly due to the large amount of data to be processed in a meaningful way. Existing software is expensive and require a long learning curve; in addition, they do not always accurately extract the needed information from the electronic medical records, such as the exact pre -transfusion hemoglobin ( Hb) level in case of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Here we describe a novel programming tool developed at The UCSF Department of Laboratory Medicine and its use in assessment of RBC transfusion at all UCSF affiliated hospitals. This project is aligned to UCSF goals of Patient Safety and Strategic Growth -by decreasing patient risks and healthcare cost associated with unnecessary RBC transfusion. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Novel Programming Tool to Assess Blood Utilization of RBC Transfusions J. Spector, S. Bakhtary, M. Moayeri, A. Nambiar, R. Thorsen, A.M. Tabacu, E. Nedelcu Department of Laboratory Medicine Transfusion Medicine Division Background Project Plan Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned A novel programming tool, TMPy , was created using Python during a one -month resident elective rotation in Patient Safety and Quality Improvement within the Department of Laboratory Medicine. The program contains 550 command lines to extract information from pre -existing SunQuest LIS monthly reports on blood utilization. TMPy data sources and output is depicted in Fig.1. Briefly, it extracts information from two LIS reports, one with transfusion data and pre -transfusion specific triggers, and the other with location and provider data. Along with a Data Dictionary, these two are assembled in one report which is readable in Excel format and amenable to further processing. Deidentified data can be further visualized via separate application ( transfusionherokuapp.com ) in interactive histogram with built in option to extract statistical information on specific pre -transfusion Hb range. Provider, specialty and location specific reports can be further derived. TMPy was used to assess blood utilization reports generated by SunQuest for the months of February to April 2018 to determine baseline RBC transfusion practice. RBC transfusion orders were extracted from the Excel document and analyzed. Mean pre -transfusion Hbfor all RBC orders was calculated. RBC orders likely associated with surgery (OR, Perioperative Prepare program, and RBC associated with more than three blood product transfusions) were excluded, and the pre -transfusion Hbwas re -assessed. TMPy synthesizes blood utilization information from SunQuest reports in a very rapid manner. It takes ~20 min from generating the SunQuest reports to transforming data in Excel format; basic LIS experience is required but no prior programming knowledge is necessary. TMPy links transfusion order to pre -transfusion trigger, providing the first critical layer of analysis in assessment of appropriateness of blood transfusions. Especially in this regard, TMPy is superior to most currently existing tools for blood utilization assessment. Further processing of TMPy provided data in Excel (or related software) is straightforward and adaptable. Personalized reports, unit or provider specific can be generated. Results:A total of 5634 orders for 6322 RBC units were made from February 1 stto April 30th, 2018, at all UCSF sites. Pre-transfusion Hbwas identified in 5223 orders (~83%). Percentage of pre- transfusion Hbis illustrated in Fig. 2. Average pre- transfusion Hbvalue is: 7.97 \u00b11.90 g/ dLfor a ll orders 7.72 g/ dLfor all orders except those from OR, Perioperative units, as well as multiple units order Example of interactive monthly display is illustrated in Fig. 3.

Percentage of pre- transfusion Hbvalues display (February 2018) Quality gap: Assessment of blood utilization at UCSF involves the review of report from SunQuest , the current Laboratory Information System (LIS). LIS monthly reports are 700 pages and contain data that are not effectively processable . Our project goals were:To create a programming tool able to extract accurate information from LIS To evaluate this programming tool for assessing baseline transfusion practice at UCSF. To analyze opportunities for improvement of RBC ordering practice Fig. 1. TMPy Data Sources and Outputs 80After recognizing the potential for medication administration errors and receiving increased regulatory agency scrutiny, we planned multiple interventions, beginning with education for clinicians (providers, pharmacists, and nurses) and followed by a series of EHR enhancements that will be deployed in phases. In the first phase of EHR enhancements, we created two types of clinical decision support (CDS) tools to decrease our most common form of therapeutic duplication: PRN mild pain. Knowing that there are other PRN reasons that will not be affected by this intervention, we chose a modest goal of reducing overall therapeutic duplication by 50%. Next Steps:We will continue to monitor the prevalence of therapeutic duplication. We plan to remove default therapeutic duplication in all order sets and then expand the scope of the alert to include other PRN reasons. We also plan to create analgesia and antiemetic order sets with embedded CDS to further prevent therapeutic duplication. Dissemination: To the best of our knowledge, using this type of alert is a novel approach to preventing therapeutic duplication. The West Bay has been successful at reducing therapeutic duplication using different workflows, and we plan to collaborate to improve compliance on both sides of the Bay. Our intervention can also be applied to other institutions struggling with therapeutic duplication. Lessons Learned: We initially implemented the pop- up alert for all PRN reasons, leading to several technical challenges. In response, we scaled back the scope of the alert and targeted only PRN mild pain.Therapeutic duplication occurs when a patient is prescribed two or more medications with the same PRN (as needed) reason. Duplicate PRN reasons are ambiguous for the bedside nurse (inpatient settings) and patient/caregiver (outpatient settings), and therefore creates an opportunity for medication administration errors. The Joint Commission, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and the State of California Public Health Department all require prescribers to avoid therapeutic duplication. We have a significant number of admitted patients that have therapeutic duplication (average ~60 patients per week). Most of these cases involve acetaminophen and ibuprofen, both written with a PRN reason of mild pain. Through focused interviews and assessment of our electronic health record (EHR), we identified two main reasons for our high prevalence of therapeutic duplication: 1)Many clinicians believe that it is in the scope of practice for a bedside nurse to decide which analgesic to administer for mild pain. 2)Multiple order sets contain medications with default duplicate PRN reasons. Our educational interventions in March and April had no effect. The creation of additional PRN reasons to acetaminophen and ibuprofen led to a slight improvement (Figure 2, Label A, marks the implementation date for this intervention). In contrast, our pop -up alert had a substantial effect, decreasing the number of patients with therapeutic duplication by ~65% from our baseline average of ~60 patients per week. Figure 2, Label B, marks the implementation of the pop -up alert. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Leveraging CDS to Prevent Therapeutic Duplication Michael Lang, MD, MPH Louis Barrios, Patrick Fleming PharmD, Christa Joseph RN, Anna Keller RD, Krista Kuchta NP Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned We educated providers, nurses, and pharmacists from the end of March through April 2018. Education was disseminated to all clinicians through global emails. More specific education was targeted to individuals caring for specific patients with therapeutic duplication. Our hope was to see some impact, but we were not optimistic given the strong tradition of placing two or more orders with the same PRN reason. We created two types of CDS tools. First, on April 23, we added several new discrete PRN reasons for acetaminophen and ibuprofen, e.g., \"acetaminophen PRN not relieved by ibuprofen after 1 hour for mild pain,\" to encourage providers to select different PRN reasons for the two medications. On May 10, we created an EHR alert (see Figure 1) that prevents the provider from signing an order that has a duplicate PRN reason of mild pain. Figure 1: This pop -up alert blocks an ordering provider from signing an order that has a duplicate PRN reason of mild pain. 01020304050607080Figure 2: Number of patients per week with therapeutic duplication A B 81Incentive Create incentive for GME and GME faculty to participate in QI.

UCSF MOCAP is expanding the program to the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Housestaff Incentive Program to engage faculty in resident projects. Dissemination UCSF MOCAP delivered oral presentations on components of these programs at the 2016 World Congress on CPD, Fall 2017 ABMS annual conference, and Fall 2017 AAMC Learn Serve Lead meeting. Lessons Learned MOC4 approval can be an effective and efficient way to create buy -in and reward faculty for supervision of student, resident, and fellow QI projects. Visit moc.ucsf.edu for more information.UCSF Maintenance of Certification Approval Program (MOCAP) UCSF became a Multi -Specialty Portfolio Program sponsor of the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) in 2013. UCSF MOCAP was established to award Maintenance of Certification Part 4 (MOC4) credit to physicians participating in institutional QI activities. UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program GME learners develop QI projects with QI leaders, service chiefs, and program directors. Financial incentives are disseminated to residents and fellows if project goals are met. UCSF Bridges Curriculum Medical students now participate in QI activities early on in the new Bridges Curriculum. Bridges Coaches and QI faculty supervise in various Clinical Microsystem Clerkship (CMC) sites. Coaches and QI faculty review students' engagement in, and progress with QI projects. Challenges Many faculty are not engaged in the medical student and resident guided QI projects within their divisions/departments. Finding faculty willing to take on additional supervisory responsibilities is difficult. There is no structured way to engage and reward faculty for supervising and mentoring students in QI activities. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Supervision of Learners in QI Projects: Engaging and Rewarding Faculty Jeffrey Tabas , Glenn Rosenbluth, Pierluissi Tymothi Peters, Sandrijn van Schaik, Robert Baron Background Goals Impact in 2017 Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned UCSF MOCAP's Alignment with UME and GME QI Initiatives Plan and Interventions UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program Reviewed all approved UCSF resident and fellow projects.

We found that some clinical activities we wished to measure were not being documented in discrete and standardized ways. Faced with this challenge, and the desire to provide clinical decision support tools in Apex for use by our staff and providers, we developed several new SmartSets. SmartSets are a clinical decision support tool that can suggest groups of orders, diagnoses, clinical documentation, patient instructions, and billing codes based on clinical scenarios.The ability to standardize orders and documentation within a department makes SmartSets an attractive potential tool for quality improvement efforts. Despite these advantages, penetrance of SmartSets within Primary Care has remained low. We need more information on clinicians' actual experience and preferences in order to successfully design and disseminate SmartSets in the future.Out of 110 providers, 96 had ever used a SmartSet. -51 had incorporated one or more into their workflow -45 had tried a SmartSet at least once -14 had never used, weren't sure, or had only used the \"Erroneous Encounter\" SmartSet For those who had used SmartSets, we asked about several developed for Primary Care use. -Variance is similar between sometime and regular users -The two most frequently used SmartSets, Well Child and Tobacco Cessation, are designed for very different clinical situations -Most providers listed more than one preferred option for learning about new SmartSets -Only one respondent was uninterested -Regular users were as likely to prefer email (i.e. self-directed) tutorials to more directed teaching -Sometime users were most likely to prefer individualized elbow -to-elbow tutorials from other providers -Sometime and non -users preferred directed teaching -A substantial minority of providers were interested in the use of Best Practice Alerts and pop- up alerts. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium SmartSet Usage in Primary Care Elisabeth Askin Maria Byron, Coleen Kivlahan, Leah Karliner Primary Care Services Background Survey Data Project Goals Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned -Understand the barriers to SmartSet use in Primary Care -Engage faculty, nurse practitioners, and residents through a survey -Educate all respondents about SmartSets within Apex051015202530 Regular Users - In Typical Workflow Sometime Users - Have TriedSmartSets in Use Well Child SmartSets (by age) Tobacco Cessation Primary Care Diabetes Convenient Orders Health Care Maintenance Orders Primary Care Adult Behavioral Health Other (ex.

Specific Goals: 1.Create a team -based coordinated care approach to geriatric hip fracture patients 2.Develop and adopt an evidence -base protocol to treat patients throughout the care episode 3.Decrease time -to-OR to < 24 hours 4.Decrease LOS to meet a LOS Index <1 5.Improve mortality and outcomes for hip fracture patientsPlanned Next Steps: 1.Obtain financial, mortality, and outcome data and compare to baseline 2.Continue monthly tracking to ensure continued adoption of the program and adherence to metric goals 3.Track the cohort of hip fracture patients longitudinally both to measure outcomes and produce research Planned Dissemination Includes: 1.Publish our interventions, outcomes and lessons learned in peer- reviewed journals 2.We have received significant interest from other hospitals for adoption of the protocol and have engaged with departments at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital to help implement a similar protocol Lessons Learned: 1.Multi- disciplinary teams combined with lean methodology results in significant improvement in care 2.Engagement of multiple stakeholders requires alignment of goals with the UCSF True North PillarsHip fractures are a growing problem for geriatric patients and confer significant morbidity and mortality in this population. Up to 24% of patients die within a year of the injury and 50% never regain their prior functional level. There is excellent data in the peer- reviewed literature that a comprehensive, multi- disciplinary management program, with timely, evidence -based care can improve outcomes however no such program existed at UCSF. At the start of our project there was very little coordination of care and we had the following metrics for the 12 months prior to the project initiation:Mean Time to OR from Admission: 52 hours Median Time to OR: 48 hours Average Length of Stay: 8.96 Days (LOS index 1.44) Direct Cost Index 2.27 Given that the national standard goal time -to- OR is 24 hours and our measured indexes were all > 1 improving these metrics align with the true north values of quality, safety, patient experience, and financial strength. Since initiation of the program the Hip Fracture Protocol has been approved and adopted by the Departments of Medicine, Cardiology, Anesthesia, Emergency, Orthopaedic Surgery, Geriatrics, and Perioperative Nursing. Daily rounds occur with geriatric co -management, physical therapy, case management, and orthopaedic surgery which guides patients through the care process. The protocol is publically and readily available on a university website ( hipfracture.ucsf.edu ) and a campaign was initiated for dissemination. There was widespread adoption of the protocol resulting in significant improvement in care. Specific metrics have improved significantly with Time -to-OR, LOS, and LOS index all achieving stated goals as below over a 6 month time period during which we have treated 93 patients. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Geriatric Hip Fracture Program: The Thundercat Protocol Hip Fracture Lean Team Stephanie Rogers, MD, Lee-lyn Chen, MD, Jahan Fahimi, MD, Johanna Powers, RN, MSN, CNOR, Derek Ward, MD Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned In order to achieve the stated project goals we created a core team of involved stakeholders including representatives from Geriatrics, Orthopaedic Surgery, Anesthesia, The Emergency Department, and Perioperative Nursing. The group used Lean methodology to create a process map to identify areas for improvement and involve other stakeholders throughout the care spectrum. We also conducted a literature review as well as brought in experts in the field to help create a protocol. The protocol was then disseminated, revised multiple times, and adopted by all stakeholders involved. Once the protocol was adopted it was rolled out in stages beginning in September of 2017 and culminating in January 2018.

Providing early follow -up and rapid cycle medication optimization can improve the outcomes for cardiovascular patients. This preliminary data based on addition of a VP to COR clinic suggests the need for a more team -based approach to transitions of care and may be a potential model for a pharmacist in the cardiac rehabilitation program.

Specifically, our goal was to increase resident exposure and training for robotics to 90%, and to allow for console time for 75% of residents in the OBGYN program. Next Steps: We plan to continue to collect data and feedback regarding the training sessions. We will also monitor the total number of GYN robotic surgery cases , cases with a robotic PA present and resident console time. It will also be of benefit to track robot docking time and, if possible, compare to historical controls to evaluate efficiency in the OR in the setting of a regularly- applied, well- established curriculum. Dissemination:We will share the data at subsequent UCSF Robotic Steering Committee meetings, and discuss shared practices among specialties. Additionally, UCSF is hosting the University of California Robotics Collaborative (UCRC) in summer 2018 and will further discuss standardizing robotic surgery curricula and educational resources. Lessons Learned: This project has demonstrated that the presence of a robotic PA provides an educational benefit in didactic teaching, dry lab, and in the intraoperative setting. Given that there are 3 robots currently in use at Mission Bay, this project highlights the value of an increased robotic PA presence for improvement of educational endeavors as well as overall efficiency.Robotic surgery was first FDA-approved for gynecology in 2005 (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). Despite the increased availability and use of this technology, a standardized robotic surgery curriculum in gynecology has not yet been developed. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons do not have a specific program, but recommend that that credentialing and privileging for robotic surgery be based on specific criteria. This includes a didactic educational program, hands -on training, appropriately selected cases and ongoing quality assurance. In the past, robotic training in a large - group, workshop format was offered on a biannual or quarterly basis to multiple residents simultaneously, with a primary focus on the bedside assistant role and limited simulation time within the session. Additional challenges of this approach included limited faculty time and availability for more dedicated teaching efforts. A robotic PA was hired in Fall 2017 to improve the quality and efficiency of the robotics program. With the addition of this role, a robotic surgery training program for gynecology residents was created, incorporating regular resident training sessions involving weekly protected simulator sessions facilitated by the robotic PA, and introductory/refresher teaching sessions run by the robotic PA to residents starting on the gynecological surgery service.An anonymous survey was sent out via SurveyMonkey to evaluate the resident experience of the standardized robotic training sessions and the addition of the robotic PA to our program. Nine of the eleven eligible residents responded. The responses were collated by a staff member who was not involved in the training program. Additionally, the number of cases where a robotic PA was present and resident time on the console were tracked from the hire date for the robotic PA until May 7, 2018. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Implementation of Interdisciplinary Robotic Training for OBGYN Residents Jeannette PA -Anane , MD UCSF Mission Bay OBGYN/Gynecologic Surgery Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Our hypothesis was to create a standardized robotic surgery OBGYN training module to administer to OBGYN residents beginning the gynecologic surgery rotation. This program was scheduled at the beginning of each rotation to provide residents with a review of the robotic system and administered by the robotic PA. This session provides residents with expectations, instruction for online modules, simulator time, demonstration of relevant techniques and hands -on training. 90Evaluate the impact of a pharmacy discharge alert tool on the number of pharmacist discharge medication reviews completed Determine whether a pharmacist intervention was performed during after -visit summary (AVS) medication review Assess the number of AVS medication reviews completed for patients discharged with a high-alert medication (insulin, anticoagulant, or opioid) Increase the percentage of discharged patients with pharmacist AVS medication review completed by at least 20% Conclusions: No statistically significant increase in the number of AVS medications reviews completed and pharmacy interventions performed Statistically significant increase in the number of AVS medication reviews completed for patients discharged with a high -alert medication Potential utility of the discharge alert tool to improve pharmacist visibility of the AVS medication list Next Steps:Expansion of the discharge alert tool to additional clinical pharmacy services Use of the tool as a standardized resource for pharmacist extenders Optimization of the discharge alert tool to identify high-risk patients Dissemination:The results of this study has been shared with pharmacy leadership and will be shared more broadly with the pharmacy department Lessons Learned: Lack of a standardized workflow can impact the efficiency of a clinical tool Medication discrepancies occur more commonly when patients are discharged from the hospital and these errors can occur in as many as 41-56% of discharged patients Hospital re-admissions or adverse drug events due to medication discrepancies impact the UCSF Health True North pillar of 'Quality and Safety' Pharmacist discharge medication reconciliation is associated with decreased readmission rates, and with decreased medication discrepancies and adverse events associated with drug therapy issues The After -Visit Summary (AVS) provided to patients at discharge contains vital medication information, which is important in patients at a high risk for hospital re-admission. Pharmacist AVS medication review and medication reconciliation can identify medication-related errors and improve patient and medication safety outcomes. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Impact of a Discharge Alert Tool on Pharmacist Discharge Medication Review Randi B. Victoria Serrano Adams, PharmD Department of Pharmaceutical Services, UCSF Health Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy Background Project Plan Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Data stratified into two cohorts: Pre-implementation of the discharge alert tool Post-implementation of the discharge alert tool Inclusion criteria: Adult patients ( 18 years old) Patients discharged from the inpatient medicine service on specific dates between January and February 2018 Exclusion criteria: Patients who left against medical advice, expired during hospitalization, transferred to another hospital Patients discharged to hospice or jail/prison Outcomes: Primary Proportion of patients with AVS medication review completed by a pharmacist Secondary Proportion of patients with a pharmacy intervention performed at AVS medication review Number of patients discharged with a high- alert medication and AVS medication review completed Intervention The discharge alert tool was created as a communication tool embedded into EPIC in the form of an in -basket message The in- basket message appears in the 'Rx Discharge' message pool when discharge medication orders are reconciled Includes a preview window of the medication list, and direct access to the patient chart and documentation of completed AVS review Demographics AVS Medication reviews completed and pharmacist interventions performed 20.2%11.0%29.3% 18.0% AVS Medication Reviews CompletedPharmacist (n=53)Post-Discharge Alert Tool (n=48)% of Patientsp = 0.032AVS medication reviews completed for patients discharged with a high- alert medication 91The North American Neuromodulation Society (NANS) has commissioned the development of a cloud-based registry to track long term outcomes of patients with SCS devices across institutions and practices. The registry will also track the outcomes of intrathecal drug delivery systems. The registry is intended to allow for both secure and confidential tracking of individual providers' outcomes for self assessment, and to provide a way of organizing a database for those electing to participate in multi -institutional research projects. Next Steps: Completion of IRB approval at all participating pilot sites, and finalization of the data infrastructure by NANS -affiliated engineers. Dissemination:The same framework for tracking neuromodulation outcomes could be applied to other opioid- sparing pain management modalities performed at UCSF Health and beyond. Lessons Learned: Creation of a versatile cloud infrastructure for HIPAA -protected data requires highly specialized engineers. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a well established therapy for pain relief that has seen tremendous growth in the past decade, supported by several randomized clinical trials. However, the long-term impact of SCS on the population of pain patients on a national scale has not been studied. Furthermore, recent restrictions placed by some insurance carriers limit access of this therapy to many patients. To improve access and further demonstrate the long-term improvement in the health of patients with implanted SCS, it is imperative to track the outcomes of these patients on a national registry. The same is true for intrathecal drug delivery systems. The conditions treated by SCS include failed back surgery syndrome and other post-surgical pain syndromes, chronic neuropathic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, ischemic pain from peripheral vascular disease, malignant pain, and more. Improved outcomes tracking is essential in our understanding of the therapies we prescribe. The cloud-based technology we describe enables us to do so in an efficient, confidential, and collaborative platform. The results from this database can be applied not only to individualized quality improvement, but also help spur interdisciplinary and multi -institutional research to enhance patient care. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Tracking Neuromodulation Outcomes in a Cloud-Based System: A UCSF and North American Neuromodulation Society Registry Initiative Roger Lee, MD, Christopher R. Abrecht, MD, Prasad Shirvalkar, MD, PhD, Pierre D'Haese, PhD, Steven Falowski, MD, Lawrence Poree, MD, PhD, MPH UCSF Pain Management Center Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned The proposed cloud-based system consists of a network of nodes, each of which are capable of data storage, processing, and normalization around de-identified subjects. The design of the cloud database revolves around four core ideas: data (integrity, fidelity, and complexity), usability (simple entry, integration into workflow), security, affordability. Outcomes include age, gender, BMI, zip code, PMH, PSH, pain diagnosis, pain descriptors, MME, trial information (date, duration, vendor, percent relief), NRS, patient global assessment of change, PHQ -9, and BPI. Complications will also be followed: infection, hematoma, migration or fracture of device, removal due to MRI, nerve damage during placement, seroma, CSF leak, unplanned admissions within 30 days of procedure, and unanticipated deaths with 180 days of procedure.

Balancing Innovation and Safety When Integrating Digital Tools Into Health Care. Ann Intern Med. 2018;168:733- 734.Digital health tools outside of the EHR have tremendous potential but require integration with the Electronic Health Record (EHR). In many cases, these tools represent new ways to diagnose or treat diseases, in others they aim to improve patient or physician experience Application Program Interfaces (APIs) have made it far easier to achieve integration, expanding possibilities for innovators at UCSF and external companies.

We hope to continue to improve process metrics related to rubric scores during this time. Outcome metrics will be monitored in the form of responses to two NRC Heath patient satisfaction survey questions, one related perceptions of the quality of MD to RN communication and a second related to the perception of the consistency of communication across providers. These will be reviewed monthly and compared to our baseline performance. This rubric is easily accessible and requires little time to complete. Thus far we are pleased with the way it promotes consistent use of best practices and serves as an entry point for discussions with team members about FCR skills. It could be distributed widely within the UCSF system to aid as a self -assessment tool in rounds should it prove to positively impact patient and family understanding of care and perception of communication amongst team members. Our project has been strengthened by the ongoing input from our colleagues in nursing, hospital pediatrics, our residency and the support from our family advisory counsel. An important time for communication between families and medical teams is morning rounds. UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland employs a family-centered rounding (FCR) technique. The process is designed to enable a multidisciplinary MD and RN team to provide and receive updates and formulate a plan of care with the patient and family at the bedside. A recent systematic review shows that families are eager to participate in FCR, and their involvement leads to increased understanding, increased communication with the medical team, and increased parental confidence in the medical team (Rea et al, 2018). The impact FCR has on overall patient satisfaction is unclear in the literature, however studies suggest improved satisfaction with communication and improved perception of consistency in communication when FCR is implemented ( Voos et al, 2011, Knoderer et al, 2009). Recent patient satisfaction survey data at BCHO identifies ongoing perceived areas for improvement in both communication between MD and RN providers and in providing consistent messages to families. Anecdotal reports of rounding experiences suggest variance in provider style, which may contribute to lapses in communication with families and amongst the team. Explaining FCR, asking open ended questions, limiting medical jargon and inviting RN participation are associated with improved encounters (Rea). 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Improving Patient and Family Rounding Experiences Through Development of a Family-Centered Rounds Rubric Sarika Sheth, MD; Ellen DeJong, MD; Hannah Tan, MD; Chris Vlasses, MD Pediatric Hospital Medicine Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Hypothesis: Implementation of a short rubric during family - centered rounds (FCR) will standardize and improve communication between medical providers and families as well as parent perception of interdisciplinary communication. Rounding practice was assessed with the Bedside PFCC Rounds Observation Checklist, a 32 -item evidence -based rubric designed to evaluate multiple domains of rounding that have been shown to have an impact on patient understanding and satisfaction (2010, Medical College of Georgia). Rounds observations with our Family Advisory Counsel were also conducted. The areas of greatest weakness were identified from these assessments and used to develop a 6 item rubric. This checklist can be completed by the rounding team immediately after a patient encounter for both self -evaluation and data collection. A draft of the rubric was created and tested. Feedback was sought from the medical and nursing teams related to clarity, functionality, and ease of use. A final rubric was completed (Fig 1) Baseline data was then collected by our team who shadowed rounds and evaluated baseline team behavior. The rubric and rounding techniques were then introduced to all three General Pediatric Medicine teams and distributed for use in rounds. We have recently begun collecting intervention data. (Fig 2) Patient satisfaction survey data related to perceptions of interdisciplinary communication and consistence in communication will also be monitored during the intervention period. Figure 1. Rubric developed for use by provider teams in self -assessment of rounds. Figure 2. Comparison of pre -and post- rubric implementation scores. Average scores for individual questions are presented (out of possible score of 2) followed by average total rubric score (out of possible 12) 94The Order Mode Dashboard was designed to improve patient safety in the order entry process, provide staff feedback and training, and facilitate regulatory compliance. The goal was to provide a tool easily accessible by nursing directors, nursing managers and providers to allow for relatively quick review of their units and identification of appropriate usage of order modes and protocols. Next Steps: Coordination of an official golive rollout to include communication to UCSF Health community and focused training for core audience of unit and clinic nurse managers Dissemination: Order Mode Dashboard is open access to all users throughout the UCSF Health community (anyone within the UCSF Network can access) Lessons Learned: During the implementation and in the first months of the pilot phase, we found that the breadth of information available revealed a multitude of issues to address that can be overwhelming to the user. This emphasized the need for focused instructions and training plans. With the increased data transparency, it was also found that consistencies in process and operational work flows were varied. One example includes the discovery of the use of an inactive order mode by an automated system within APeX.According to estimates, there are over 200 million orders in APeX. The volume of orders makes it difficult and cumbersome to fully evaluate the data and process compliance. Use of nonprovider protocols and order modes has increased. Monitoring appropriate order mode use is associated with the True North Pillars of Quality & Safety, Patient Experience, and Our People. To monitor safety and regulatory compliance associated with use of nonprovider protocols and order modes, an assessment determined the following were needed: A standardized process for unit and clinic nurse managers to monitor and provide staff feedback for appropriate use of order mode and nonprovider protocols A tool (dashboard) for nurse managers to assist with monitoring order mode use compliance A tool to measure provider cosign compliance rates A tool for managers and/or designees for monitoring quality review process Data for reportout to appropriate committee(s)Order Mode Dash has two tabs: Home and Trend. The Home tab provides detailed views of Order Mode by Department, User Name, User Role (RN, MA, etc.), Order Type (Medication, POCT, Labs, etc.) and Order Name (specific medication or procedure being ordered). The dashboard provides the ability to drill down by any of those categories. Order details are also displayed and allows the user to export the data to excel or open the patient's chart (when opened within APeX) to do further investigation. The Trend tab of Order Mode Dash displays multiple views for the data trended over time, such as Order Volume, Order Mode used, Cosign Compliance by Provider: 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Order Mode Dashboard Identifying and evaluating order mode utilization Order Mode Team Project Sponsors: S Kedrowski, J Mechanic Project Leads: T Ochoa, J Pacholuk Team: R Cafferky, G Davis, D Diaz, S Ng, V Rayanker, T Satterwhite, A Shetty, E Sin, W Wat Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Plan: Completed intake and gathered business requirements around all sources. Focus groups with key customers were conducted to ensure needs were met. Analysis : A data mart and dashboard would be created. Design/Develop : A data mart, the OMD Data Mart, and Order Mode Dashboard were created. Daily refresh of data from APeX to the OMD Data Mart was automated and made available to supply data to the OMD Dashboard. Test: Extensive functional and data validation testing was completed. Data validation comprised of comparing data at stages of processing, first APeX to OMD Data Mart and then OMD Data Mart to OMD Dashboard. Deploy : Both the OMD Data Mart and Order Mode Dashboard went live on March 21, 2018 for a pilot soft launch with an official golive rollout to be communicated to UCSF community in approx. 6 months post pilot launch. Maintain : Review of the daily data flow, dashboard refresh and usability in process. Any requests for enhancements or/and break fixes would be addressed by repeating the SDLC process as typically done in performance improvement or quality improvement PDSA cycles, starting with the Plan step. Order Mode Dashboard and Order Mode Data Mart were implemented using the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process. SDLC has similar steps when compared to the PDSA cycle. 95 Project Goals 1.Define the problem. What isn't working with the EHR Sandbox environment today? 2.Define impact and downstream effects on innovation. 3.Develop requirements to address problems identified. 4.Use requirements to accelerate innovation by building the EHR Sandbox.An EHR Sandbox has the potential to catalyze innovation and implementation Next steps1.Complete technical requirements to create a proof-of-concept for an EHR Sandbox 2.Assign a development team to build out an initial proof-of-concept for the Sandbox and to have UCSF developers provide feedback on its use. 3.Find a solution for de-identifying selected cohorts of real patient data for use by innovators in the Sandbox.The Digital Diagnostics & Therapeutics (DD&T) Committee governs access to UCSF's EHR Sandbox environment (ACE6). Feedback from current users indicate that ACE6's limitations are inhibiting the speed and quality of testing . When innovations can't be iteratively developed and tested, it creates a bottleneck which impedes clinical and operational innovations. Overcoming this bottleneck could generate additional IP and revenue opportunities for UCSF and enhance our innovation capacity .Presented below is a comparison of current state and three potential solutions. Based on this analysis, DD&T determined that a more robust, internally hosted environment that is a copy of APeX Production (but with all PHI removed) would most fully meet user needs at UCSF. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Accelerating Safe and Effective Innovation: Creating an Ecosystem to Test New Digital Solutions with the EHR Sarah Schewe Jennifer Gitchell Center for Digital Health Innovation (CDHI) and the Digital Diagnostics and Therapeutics (DD&T) Committee Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned 50+ interviews conducted across stakeholders to understand how innovative ideas do or do not get implemented into the EHR.

This includes patients discharged directly from the PACU as well as 23-hour stay units. The purpose of the call is to assess for postoperative concerns or complications which warrant further follow up. Over an 8-month period (Apr - Dec 2017) we added two additional questions: Question 1: Were you prescribed opioids for post-operative Dilaudid. Only patients who answered \"yes\" received Question 2 Question 2: If yes - are you currently taking them? For most patients these calls took place on POD 1. However, for 23-hour stay patients and for those whom POD 1 fell on a weekend or holiday, the phone call took place on POD 2-5. Many post-surgical patients require pain medication after their operations and are discharged home with an opioid prescription. However, individual prescribers have varying prescribing patterns, and therefore these post-discharge opioid prescriptions are often not tailored to patients' analgesic requirements. Prescribers may err toward over-prescription of opioids to ensure their patients do not experience post-surgical pain. When patients are discharged with more opioid than they need, the extra pills are available for abuse and/or diversion. This opioid initiation after surgery is a major driver of the opioid epidemic. We aimed to identify post-surgical opioid prescribing practices that could be modified to enhance patient safety at UCSF. We utilized the pre-existing Cipherhealth automated phone call which goes out to all ambulatory surgery patients (MB/ML/MZ) one day after discharge to assess whether they are using prescribed opioid. Our assumption was that patients who are prescribed opioids but deny use of them as early as the day after discharge are likely over-prescribed. Next Steps: We found that a significant portion of patients undergoing ambulatory surgery at UCSF are not using opioids as early as POD 1. We assume that these patients represent cases of opioid over-prescription. We plan to utilize the EMR to gain more information on these patients such as surgery service and type to further stratify them. Over the next year, we will be designing and implementing a program at Mount Zion to 1) provide patient education and goal-setting regarding pain control in the pre-operative period, and 2) develop discharge guidelines for pain regimens (both opioid and non-opioid multimodal analgesics) after specific types of ambulatory surgeries. We will then be conducting a post-operative assessment of patients' opioid use and satisfaction with their post-operative pain regimens, along with evaluating whether rate of opioid prescriptions and duration of therapy decrease. Dissemination: We will be collaborating with UCSF surgical services to coordinate design and implementation of this upcoming project. Once surgical services know about this program, they may be able to extrapolate the patient education components into their pre-operative discussions. This would could also be extended to patients undergoing surgeries followed by inpatient stays. Lessons Learned: This presents an important opportunity to safely reduce opioid use amongst UCSF ambulatory surgical patients, thereby preventing opioid use-related complications and associated healthcare costs. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Eliminating Opioid Over-Prescription After Ambulatory Surgery Anjali Dixit, MD, MPH Christina Inglis-Arkell, MD UCSF Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care Background Project Plan and Survey Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Over this 8-month period, 8931 patients had ambulatory surgery at UCSF and received post-discharge automated phone calls. 72.2% of patients contacted responded to our questions, and of this group 77.7% were surveyed on POD1. Among those who reported having been prescribed an opioid, 41.1% of those contacted on POD1 denied using it at the time of automated phone call. * POD1 was calculated by finding the difference between the discharge date and the date the patient received the phone call. In a small fraction of patients this calculation for POD1 is inaccurate, because they stayed at the hospital for 23 hours after their surgery. In these cases, they would have been called on POD2 but included in the POD1 group, which would likely result in underestimation of the final box in this row. 8931 patients met inclusion criteria from 4/11/2017 to 12/21/2017 6446 total phone survey respondents (72.2% response rate) 5008 of these were contacted on POD1* (77.7% of total respondents) 2660 were prescribed opioids (answered \"yes\" to question 1) (53.1% of POD1 contacts) 1092 of these were not using them (41.1% of those prescribed were not using) 1438 of these were contacted on POD2-5 (22.3% of total respondents) 714 of these were prescribed opioids (answered \"yes\" to question 1) (49.7% of POD2-5 contacts) 382 of these were not using them (53.5% of those prescribed weren't using) 98Massage Therapy was offered weekly, every Tuesday for a total 10 months by a trained massage therapist trained in massage for BMT inpatients We created a massage consult order request in Apex/EMR system (Figure 1) patients whom consented to a massage intervention. All patients on the BMT service were offered a massage consultation every Tuesday. Some patients were seen on a weekly basis until discharge. We included patients with low platelets (deep tissue massage was avoided). The massage service was funded with $10,000 of philanthropic gifts. Figure 1 : Massage Order Set ApexNext Steps: Tracking medication reduction use to assess cost savings of massage therapy. There are few massage therapists with training necessary to provide inpatient massage, and this could be addressed via further curriculum development. To secure ongoing funding to sustain this program on the BMT Service. Dissemination: This model could be applied to other chronically ill populations to manage symptoms frequently observed in the inpatient setting. Lessons Learned: Massage therapy was feasible to deliver during BMT patients' hospitalization and impacted positively on fatigue, anxiety, distress, pain and tension. Patients admitted with hematologic malignancies often suffer from lengthy hospital stays resulting in isolation, poor sleep, pain, anxiety, situational depression, and distress. Massage therapy has been proven useful for reduction of anxiety, pain and depression in oncology patients and equivalent to pharmacologic drug therapy. Healing Hands: A Massage Therapy Pilot Program in Adult Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Patients Carla Kuon SRae Wannier James Harrison Carolyn Tague Osher Center for Integrative Medicine & Division of Hospital Medicine Background Project Evaluation & Impact Project Goals Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned We evaluated the effects of massage and therapy by collecting surveys assessing a 7-point symptom constellation of pain, anxiety, nausea, distress, tension, fatigue, sleep quality, and patient satisfaction over 10 months . 106 of 188 patients who received massage therapy returned surveys.

In addition careful routing of prescriptions can decrease the time that it takes to acquire medication authorization, to start treatment and also minimize cost by decreasing fees paid to outside pharmacies to process prescriptions. This model has the potential to be implemented into other ambulatory care areas to improve care facilitate medication access, and decrease costs. Dissemination: The results will be discussed with the Viral Hepatitis Clinic and pharmacy leadership Lessons Learned: 1) Navigating through the insurance payor system can be very complex. 2)HCV treatment is rapidly changing. New drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) need to be integrated into HCV treatment guidelines and reviewed for addition to drug formularies. The formulary review process takes time. 3)Regular benchmarking will assist with identifying trends for further improve quality and efficiencyThe Viral Hepatitis Clinic at UCSF Medical Center utilizes a multidisciplinary team model that includes medical providers, clinical pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and medical assistants to provide comprehensive patient care. A full- time pharmacist and pharmacy technician have been integrated into the clinic to provide care to patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and facilitate access to antiviral medications. The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is rapidly changing. While the new all oral antiviral agents are highly effective (cure rates >90%), they are also very expensive (can exceed >$100,000 per treatment course).With the high cost of HCV treatments, third - party payors frequently utilize prior authorizations (PAs) and formulary restrictions. This can lead to decreased patient access to medications and delays in starting treatment. A standardized workflow was developed. Patients referred to the Viral Hepatitis Clinic are evaluated for treatment. The pharmacist reviews the patient's clinical information to determine the optimal HCV treatment regimen. The HCV prescription is triaged to certain specialty pharmacies based on insurance payor requirements. Prior authorization (and higher-level appeals) are obtained by the pharmacist . Co-pay assistance is also obtained to minimize out of pocket costs to the patient. Once approved, the patient is seen in the clinic for a treatment initiation visit. The patient's medication list is reconciled to identify potential drug -drug interactions. The patient receives extensive counseling on their HCV treatment regimen. Follow -up labs/clinic visits are coordinated with the medical provider. Information (e.g. drug regimen, start/stop date, pharmacy is documented in APeX to facilitate management across the continuum of care. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Clinical Pharmacist Improves HCV Medication Access, Optimizes Outcomes, and Decreases Costs Philip Kong, Pharm.D., BCPS David Quan, Pharm.D., BCPS Department of Pharmacy Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Patients seen in the Viral Hepatitis Clinic at UCSF Medical Center for treatment of HCV infection are cared for by a pharmacist and pharmacy technician. The HCV treatment regimen is reviewed for appropriateness, screened for potential -drug -drug interactions. The pharmacist coordinates the prior authorization process (and obtains higher- level approval if necessary). Co-pay assistance is also obtained (if necessary) to facilitate access to medication and out of pocket cost to the patient. The prescription for HCV medication is triaged to an outside specialty pharmacy or the UCSF Transplant Pharmacy based on insurance payor requirements. During the treatment initiation visit, the pharmacist reconciles the patient's medication list for any potential drug -drug interactions. Changes to the medication regimen are coordinated with the medical provider. The patients receive extensive counseling on their HCV treatment regimen to promote medication adherence. Figure 1.

Next Steps:We hope to further analyze the curriculum's impact by surveying students after the curriculum is completed to see how many have incorporated their self- identified changes into clinical practice. Dissemination:A similar framework could be adopted by outpatient providers during follow up appointments with patients after hospital discharge. Lessons Learned: A Transitions of Care Curriculum increased students' awareness of patient risk factors for adverse events during care transitions. The curriculum led students to critically think about changing their future clinical practice to address care transitions issues.Transitions of care are commonly associated with adverse medical events, particularly surrounding discharge from the hospital. Few medical trainees receive formal education in recognizing and addressing patients most at risk for these adverse events. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium A Transitions of Care Curriculum for Third Year Medical Students UCSF Division of Hospital Medicine Jessica Fuller, James Harrison, Cindy Lai, Archna Eniasivam Background Curriculum Overview Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Project Description Third year medical students rotating through a three -site Internal Medicine program from June 2016- April 2017 participated in the curriculum. Students participated in three areas of curriculum: didactic teaching, post -discharge follow up phone call with a patient, and group debrief at the end of the rotation. In total, 107 students participated, organized into 11 cohorts that each completed the three part curriculum. Write ups were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. This involved categorizing data into themes to describe patients' experienced adverse systems events and students' self- identified changes to clinical practice as a result of completing the curriculum.1. DIDACTIC LESSON Identify risk factors for adverse events based on SHM Project BOOST 8Ps risk assessment screening tool Problems medications Psychological diagnosis Principal diagnosis Polypharmacy Poor health literacy Patient support Prior hospitalization Palliative care2. POST -DISCHARGE CALL Use standardized templates modeled after Project BOOST to call at least one patient Assess patient comprehension and retention of care plan using evidence -based approaches: Ask-Teach -Ask strategy Looking Ahead strategy Complete a formal write up based on this template summarizing findings Share findings of the call with clinical team who cared for patient3. DEBRIEF & FEEDBACK Share findings from follow up phone call Identify common themes across all encounters Reflect on clinical practice changes that could be enacted to combat these adverse systems issues Obtain structured feedback on formal write up \"It was one of the more rewarding experiences I've had in medical school and [...] it will inform aspects of medicine that I may want to prioritize moving forward in my career.\" \"Working through the risk factors for adverse events (8Ps) [...] increased my awareness of common risk factors and will help me risk stratify patients in the future [...]\" Of all participating 107 students, 99 (93%) completed the writing assignment in full. Of 107 contacted patients, 65 (61%) reported experiencing at least one adverse event related to a healthcare systems issue. Of 101 healthcare systems issues identified (Figure 1), the most common were: -Lack of timely follow up: 30 -Inadequate communication with patient or caregiver: 26 Students identified 241 changes they would enact in their future clinical practice (Figure 2): -Improve communication with patients and caregivers: 102 -Change their approach to patient education and anticipatory guidance: 31 -Change in scheduling follow up appointments: 24 101Turnaround time improved by 71% As part of UCSF Health's vision to be the best provider of healthcare services , we are committed to delivering the highest level of patient -centered care possible , which includes optimizing the use of EHR for clinic visits with team based workflows and supporting communication via MyChart and In Basket. The staff, providers, and leadership team of UCSF Health are persistent in their pursuit to provide high -quality patient care. While clinics do a great job in caring for the patient, we recognize that our current processes for the EHR do not always work smoothly for patients, staff, and providers . Improve practice experience and increase APeX efficiency with team centered workflows, specifically: Improve physician satisfaction where at least 60% of respondents agree or strongly agree that their satisfaction with APeX has improved Decrease average turnaround time of MyChart In Basket messages in by at least 10% Partner with Lean to improve efficiencies in clinic and spread across other clinics.

Lessons Learned: SWIS was easier to isolate to key representatives in AQI based on skill set. Replicated model used by Ambulatory Quality to own IG processing, review request and letter generation. When evaluating the number of grievances, difficult to know what should \"count\" as a grievance and how to enter into RL solutions when the grievance includes multiple dates and locations. Decision: a grievance file is created for each different locations and are linked in RL Solutions. Response to health plan would receive one letter back. Adult Quality Improvement (AQI) and Ambulatory Quality are responsible for responding to grievances filed by health plans in order to maintain negotiated contract requirements and ensure claims reimbursement is processed. Solely relying on separate, manual processes, we gather and track information related to the insurance grievance (IG), then submit a response to the health plan. Each time an IG is received, current work is disrupted and/or delayed in order for the Quality Analyst to thoroughly review. The process takes a significant amount of time to reach out to various providers, review charts and track down information from other departments that use their own process for storing data. This often leads to duplicate reviews, frustration for all parties involved, and the inability to meet the health plan's deadline for a response. Concise Problem Statement: The AQI IG response lead time of 10 days exceeds the health plans deadline in 70% of cases and takes an average of 4.8 hours (range 1 -9 hrs) of unanticipated work time to investigate and respond, often without complete information from providers or other departments involved. 70% of IG requests require a deadline extension; regular work is delayed; and extreme frustration is reported. At the same time, opportunities to learn from grievances are lost due to the inability to identify themes and share across departments. 1)Decrease lead time from 10 days to 5 in order to ensure timely response. 2)Decrease # of extensions from 70% to 35% to minimize waste and unnecessary work. 3)Develop process to identify themes of grievances in order to capture opportunities for improvement. 4)Enhance multi -disciplinary collaboration and communication. Goal Model: Create a model where all departments are able to easily collaborate, and still work independently. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Responding to Insurance Grievances Adult Quality Improvement Lindsey Walicek, Daphne Nguyen, Mariah Bianchi and our multi -disciplinary team members: Angela Beck -Alioto, Chris Diamond, Janice Hull, Amy Hyams, Ivy Kolvan, & Susan Penney Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned A3Identify multi -disciplinary A3 workgroup Create process map of current state with pain points Prioritized ProblemsGrievances are addressed by multiple departments separately, records are maintained by the individual department IG are routed to wrong department(s), requiring an extension request Manual process with limited data fields inhibits theme identification, reporting, and analysis ExperimentsDevelop standard work instruction sheet (SWIS) for receiving, reviewing, & responding to IG across inpatient and ambulatory settings Implement electronic documentation in RL Solutions Feedback Module Develop cross discipline notifications to encourage a comprehensive review Categorize IG themes & improvement opportunities IGPrivacy HIMS (Medical Records) Patient Experience Risk Management Patient Safety Ambulatory QualityAQI Average Lead Time steadily decreased.

Many of the nurses have also expressed an interest in pursing a clinical nurse III advancement, and these taskforces would provide them with multiple projects to use for clinical ladder applications. Also using the strong sense of comradery and friendship among staff as an advantage, the hypothesis was that staff would be motivated to work along side some of their \"best friends\" and have a sense of accomplishment when completing projects together. The leadership team met to identify the specific taskforces based on current needs of the department. The taskforce facilitators were identified based on identified areas of skill, interest and leadership qualities. Some of the taskforces were already established and had identified members working on projects. The action plan was shared at a staff meeting, and all staff were expected to choose a taskforce that was of interest to them. The staffing schedule has a built -in hour allotted for education each week, and this time was to be utilized for meetings and task- force work. Next Steps: Councils are continuing to meet and work on current projects. Data collection from the 2017 NDNQI survey will be used to measure the effect of the interventions. Dissemination : Through communication of work to the Periop Leadership team, many projects have been shared with leaders at other campuses. The Periop Informatics Director has also been included to assist in project implementation. The Clinical Nurse Educator is working with nurses to share project work at upcoming conferences and for Clinical Nurse III applications. Lessons Learned: Providing additional mentoring and leadership support to council facilitators is necessary. Many staff nurses have limited experience in leadership roles and need more support and feedback to monitor progress. Approaches to maintain momentum with infrequent meeting and inconsistent team members . Creative strategies to e ngage off -shift and part -time staff is neededThe leadership team of the Mission Bay Pediatric Operating Room strategized to address the UCSF True North Pillar of \"Our People\" to improve the work experience for staff. Results from the 2016 NDNQI results showed that the department scored lower in nursing satisfaction than a majority of other sites within UCSF. Leadership team members include the manager, assistant manager and clinical nurse educator. One of the reported strengths was having a \"best friend\" as work. As a Magnet designated institution, the concept of shared governance is a core structural component of the Magnet model that addresses structural empowerment. This power structure allows nurses to have significant influence over practice changes with added autonomy, influence and ultimately job satisfaction. Many studies credit this flattened hierarchy and increased decision making with an increase in RN satisfaction . 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Increasing Staff Engagement through Shared Governance MB Pediatric OR Anjal Pong, Clinical Nurse Educator & Cassandra Robertson, Manager Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Pre-Procedure Huddle*Pressure Injury Prevention Turn-Over ReductionSuture Reduction Hand-Off Communication *Unit Practice Council To improve RN Satisfaction scores in the following NDNQI survey by 25% through shared governance councils.

This project focused on identif ying the root causes of repetitive strain injuri es (RSI's) and discomf ort experienced by staff in the Heart and Lung Transplant department. This project began in 2016 due to a number of harm events reported by staff (17 out of 17 employees), four of which resulted in workers' compensation claims. Injur ies sustained were strains to the neck, wrists, hands and back. Another fact or that needed to b e addresse d was to ensur e compliance with Cal/OSH A's Ergonomics Standar d Title 8 Sect ion requires worksit e evalua tions, interven tions and training when injuri es occur to more than o ne employ ee, performing the same job task within a 12-mon th period. Team Members Lori Coleman Phyllis SimmonsRobert Kosnik, MD Arlen BayquenOn average, the cost of an RSI injury is approximately $25,000. The impact on employee health and organizational costs (if 17injuries occurred) would be over $525,000, plus any legal implications related to non -compliance of Cal/OSHA's Ergonomics Standard. As a result of the ergonomic interventions implemented over a two year period, discomfort reports decreased from 17 to 0. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Ergonomics Staff Harm Reduction Heart and Lung Transplant Department Workers' Compensation, Ergonomics & Occupational Health Services Team Members Unit/Practice/Service Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned The project was a comprehensive overview bringing together subject matter experts, management and staff.

Future Directions: Examine balancing measures of reduced RVP ordering including (1) antibiotic usage and (2) use of droplet isolation precautions Adjust LOS data for age, socioeconomic status, and admission diagnosis Compare LOS results to institutions with fast RVP turn- around time Dissemination: Analyzing downstream effects on high cost utilization (such as hospital days) related to common test overuse has potential implications for the entire health system. Similar approaches may help to assess the value proposition for other improvement efforts . A recent patient complaint letter to the UCSF Emergency Department highlighted the $3450 charge for a Respiratory Viral Panel PCR. This led UCSF faculty interested in integrating patient input into QI and Value initiatives to investigate Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) PCRs as a potential source of waste within our system. The Institute of Medicine Report Best Care At Lower Cost estimated that unnecessary services were the largest contributor to healthcare waste in the US, totaling > $210 billion annually. The UCSF Infectious Diseases Management Program (IDMP) recommends the Rapid Flu PCR for all patients, with the RVP only for critically ill or immunocompromised patients (Figure 1). During much of the year, RVP PCRs are performed only 3 days per week (M,W,F) and are never performed on the weekends. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Overuse of Respiratory Viral Panel PCR A QI and Value Assessment Division of Hospital Medicine & Department of Emergency Medicine Peter Barish, MD, Madeline Treasure, BS, Michelle MS, Jahan Fahimi , MD/PhD, Ari Hoffman, MD Background Project Design and Analysis Project Goals Project Interventions Next Steps and Dissemination To understand the use, and potential overuse, of RVP PCRs on inpatient services at UCSF based on appropriate -use guidelines from the IDMP Estimate cost burden of inappropriate RVP use when ordered for non -ICU, immunocompetent patients Identify target areas for improved clinical decision making and EMR decision support tools Targeting the General Medicine Service: improve provider understanding of appropriate -use criteria and reduce ordering of unnecessary RVP PCRs 1.Educational Campaign targeting physicians and nurses Distribute \" Appropriate Use\" criteria with help of IDMP (Figure 1) 2.Uncouple Rapid Influenza and RVP testing in Apex (Epic) order set Current order (see fig) allows easy dual -ordering unintentionally Respiratory Viral Panel Combined with Rapid Flu in Epic EMR 3.Testing Frequency -future Daily RVP testing during flu season to reduce RVP result time, improve its use in clinical decision making May reduce unnecessary LOS increases (further study necessary)1. Estimates of Overuse: of the 1523 RVP PCRs Identified In 26% the result returned after the patient was discharged from the hospital 60% of RVPs were ordered outside of internal IDMP guidelines (Figure 1)45% of RVP PCRs were ordered simultaneously with a Rapid Flu Days to RVP PCR resultFigure 2: Distribution of turn -around times for the Respiratory Viral Panel PCR, by frequency Mean time to test result: 1.9 Days Figure 1: UCSF Infectious Disease Management Program (IDMP) algorithm for RVP PCR use 2. Impacts of Overuse: based on 60% discordance with IDMP ordering guidelines At a cost of $119.81 per test, RVPs lead to $109,473 in excess direct costs RVP testing, relative to other respiratory virus testing, was associated with 1.5 days longer length of stay This association remained significant when controlling for medical complexity 110The aspirational goal istorecord evidence of immunity orimmunization inallhealth care workers .Gaps inrecording have been created because there has been shifting guidelines for the evidence ofimmunity; the priority in onboarding has been surveillance ;and thelack ofafocused data management program.

CDC. Measles Virus Next Steps: The potential impact of non -compliance has not been eliminated. UCSF OHS will continue to employ the strategies of staff alignment, supervisor involvement, and web -based tools. The aspirational goal is within reach. The approach will be adapted and applied to allied staff such as the medical staff, campus staff working within UCSF Health in health care settings, and campus staff working at affiliated organizations. Ideally, the program could be extended to all UCSF staff. Dissemination: The success of this project will be shared with leadership through the UCSF Occupational Health and Safety Program advisory committee, and the UC Occupational and Environmental Health Advisory Committee. Within UCSF Health, Manager's Weekly will have scheduled announcements and reminders. Lessons Learned: 1.Staff aligned strategies in clinics can impact positively the quality within the clinic. 2.It is difficult for staff aligned strategies to widely impact quality within UCSF Health. 3.The impact of quality projects are increased when supervisors are directly involved. 4.It is helpful to have a web- based tool that is periodically updated.

Admin staff checked TrakIt when scheduling appointments and left notes for RNs when non -compliance was identified. Medical Assistants checked TrackIt prior to rooming the staff. Nurse Practitioners reviewed TrackIt for their staff. 2.The results of a 97 tests for MMR titers to validate previous work on the incidence of lack of immunity in staff . 3.OHS Staff reached out to staff through direct telephone calls, department targeted emails, and outreach clinics. The progress of these interventions were reviewed. Progress was being made, but the pace of improvement was slow because there is a limited number of staff who walk -in to OHS. It was reasoned that the intervention would be more effective if individuals were referred to UCSF OHS. Additional interventions were added in May 2017: 4.Development of a web -based tool for tracking compliance by unit. TrackIt was used to supply a compliance feed to the Human Resources \"Umbrella\" tool. MMR compliance was added to the Occupational Health Overall Compliance tab. This provided staff and management with the opportunity to review compliance. 5.Communication to supervisors in Managers Weekly and other message boards. Finally, it was suggested that the rework activity above could be eliminated by completing immunization compliance during onboarding : 6.Follow up with staff on non -compliance identified during onboarded staff leaning on the requirement to follow infection control practices in the offer letter.

Consider the impact ofaprovider who by:Robert by 25% from 22 CLABSIs (1.89/1,000 CVC days) in the first half of FY18 to accruing a maximum of 16 CLABSIs (1.38/1,000 CVC days using projected line days) in the second half of FY18. In order to achieve this goal, the multidisciplinary CLABSI Prevention Committee (CPC) was formed in December 2017. The group includes unit -based nurse and physician leaders, ancillary leadership including aneshesia/perioperative, bedside/ancillary nurse champions, the Vascular Access and Support Team, Patient Safety, and Infection Control. The group focused on the key drivers identified in the first two CPC meetings: 1. Sharing of CLABSI data with frontline (i.e. visual management)Not visible on all units or meaningfully presented (days since last event, # patients harmed; increase validity of audits) 2. CVC discussion in rounds Line necessity, use, function, and contamination not consistently discussed 3. Standardization of CVC care across BCH Adherence to nursing policies not uniform 4.Education/training for allstaff -not standard among all staff in all areasNext Steps: Focus on other elements of CLABSI bundle compliance -use of passive disinfectant protector, CHG Bathing Finish implementation of auditing 25% of CVC per month in every unit Continue engaging ancillary areas and residentsWeekly operational huddle with key leadership -to launch June 2018 Dissemination:Develop a mechanism for sharing with the UCSF adult CLABSI Reduction GroupContinue to engage adult CLABSI prevention champion and BCH -Oakland as members of CPC Implement standard \"days since last CLABSI\" posters and post on units in visible areasUtilize staff huddles/meetings, faculty meetings, written reminders and visual management Lessons Learned: Need for project management, data infrastructure, improvement support for operations, auditing, informatics to optimize charting and ability for real -time audit and feedback with EMR. Difficult maintaining engagement of frontline and physician staff. Resident education critical. Central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in prolonged length of stay, and significant morbidity and mortality. Literature shows that standard, evidence- based CLABSI prevention bundles are associated with decreased infection rates. UCSF adheres to a CLABSI prevention bundle that includes these evidence- based standards: -Dressing clean dry and intact (CDI) place dressing change -Intact CVC change -Daily screening for protectors The overall BCH -SF CLABSI number and rate increased significantly in the first half of FY18. In FY17, BCH-SF had 30 CLABSIs (1.3/1,000 -SF had 22 CLABSs (1.89/1,000 CVC also noted that the BCH -SF CLABSI prevention bundle compliance decreased in this same time period. In FY17 the compliance was 88% and it decreased to 85% in the first half of FY18. For the bundle element of dressing CDI, the FY17 compliance was 94% and it decreased to 88% in FY18. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium BCH-SF CLABSI REDUCTION: A FRESH START WITH CPC CLABSI Prevention Committee (CPC) Deb Franzon, MD; Lynn MPH, CIC Unit champions from all BCHSF inpatient units and ancillary departments Background Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned P.D.S.A. #1: Standardize interpretation of Dressing Clean/Dry/Intact Plan: Using input from all units, reach consensus and create visual tool for this bundle component. Do:Each unit take 5 pictures of different dressings in various states of intact vs. questionable.Study : Ask the nurse at the bedside two questions: Would you change this dressing? Why or why not?Act: In CPC, review all photos together, refine interpretation, reach consensus. Create and disseminate a visual standard. P.D.S.A. #2: Standardize & Implement CVC Rounding Tool Plan :Integrate daily discussion about central lines into every clinical inpatient unit.Do:Each unit provide 3 components that should be included in every unit's CVC discussion.Study : Try out these 3 elements once with the rounding team on 5 - 10 patients. What worked? What didn't work? Act: Committee will decide on key elements for all rounding tools and implement by February 2018. P.D.S.A. #3: CLABSI education sharing across BCH Plan: Disseminate practice update to all nurses and providers.Do: Unit-based leadership, champions and medical directors -select among 7 CVC topics to share during change of shift, staff/faculty meeting, email, and/or post.Study: Survey sent to staff to a) seek their receipt of practice update, and b) assess their knowledge. Act: Provide staff response and barriers to sharing practice update at March 2018 meeting. Since the CLABSI Prevention Committee (CPC) kick-off, BCH- SF has only experienced 8 CLABSIs and our rate decreased to 1.08/1,000 CVC days in the first 4 months of the second half of FY18. Five of our eight inpatient units have gone more than 100 days without a CLABSI. As our overall CLABSI bundle compliance has increased, our CLABSI rate has decreased. There has been an increase in the dressing CDI component of our prevention bundle in the months since CPC initiation. 112The purpose of standardizing nursing handoff at BCH was to create an effective and efficient way to give shift handoff, prevent and/or discover errors by performing a bedside handoff, equip nurses to participate in rounds, improve patient and family involvement and satisfaction, and ultimately improve patient quality of care. A secondary goal was to improve continuity across the acute care areas.Next Steps: A predicted future challenge is the sustainment of the nursing bedside handoff on C6. Historically, compliance with the bedside handoff has been low so future audits/observations should be gathered to assess compliance over time. Another future factor to measure is the affect the standardized nursing handoff has had on patient/family satisfaction . Dissemination:The C6 standardized nursing handoff has already been adopted on C5 and could easily be adapted and used across all BCH units. Lessons Learned: Successfully creating a large practice change requires thorough planning, ample time, and clear communication and follow up. Standardizing nursing handoff on C6 has become a successful and sustainable process improvement. Nationally, many institutions have adopted a standardized nursing handoff process. Research shows that standardized nursing handoffs are effective, efficient, and improve patient care and safety. The pediatric hematology/oncology/bone marrow transplant unit at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital (BCH), C6, did not have a standardized way of giving nursing handoff. Due to this, there was high variability in the way nurses communicated information at change of shift and errors resulted from poor communication or omissions in nursing handoff. The data from the audits and survey showed an overwhelming improvement in and positive attitudes towards nursing handoffs on the unit. Specifically, the communication of topics in handoff increased from 61% in the pre -audits to 96% in the post -audits. Bedside handoff compliance improved from 48% to 95% and 72% of nurses surveyed reported that the bedside component of handoff increased patient safety or quality of care. Implementing a standardized nursing handoff on C6 greatly improved the efficiency and quality of information relayed at handoff, increased knowledge of the patient care plan, and decreased interruptions during handoff. Information is now relayed in a standardized and structured order to improve continuity and create accountability during handoff. More consistently performing a bedside handoff has increased patient safety and patient/family satisfaction. Standardizing nursing handoff across acute care has also created better continuity for nurses floating between units. It was a successful implementation and process improvement. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Implementing a Standardized Nursing Handoff Process on a Pediatric Unit at UCSF Cassi Whitney RN, BSN, CPHON, CNIII Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplant Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Plans for standardizing nursing handoff were announced to C6 nursing staff in December of 2016 through an email Data was collected by auditing nursing handoffs on C6 from January to April 2017 The data supporting the need for a standardized nursing handoff was presented at the C6 staff meeting in April of 2017 An acute care standardized nursing handoff was developed through collaboration with nursing management and two bedside nurses on C5 and C6 All acute care nurses were educated on the new standardized nursing handoff process at Clinical Review in May of 2017 The standardized nursing handoff process went live in June of 2017 Post -implementation data was collected by auditing nursing handoffs on C6 from June to October 2017 and through an anonymous survey sent to all C6 nurses in September of 2017 113Our aim is to increase the completion of the two dose series of Human Papilloma Vaccine in female patients age 13-15from 42.8 % to above 50% -2017: 30% 2018: patients to evaluation in FY 2019.Dissemination:Collaborate with other primary care practices to align metric across UCSF system.Lessons Learned: Vaccine hesitancy for non- school required vaccines for adolescents requires targeted communication strategies.Some patients served in the FQHC are behind on immunizations. Many preteens and teens are not getting HPV vaccine when they receive other recommend vaccines. According to the CDC, in 2014, 91.3% of 13 year old girls could have received at least one dose HPV vaccine if they had received an HPV vaccine at the same time they received other recommend vaccines. Nationally, in 2016, 43.4% of adolescents (49.5% of females; 37.5% of males) were up to date with the HPV vaccination series, applying the updated HPV vaccine recommendations retrospectively. Vaccine hesitancy is one of the reasons for low vaccine rate with HPV. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/teens/vaccination For more information on the update recommendations, read the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR): https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6549a5.htm .

Tam, Ph.D. Principal Investigator, HRSA Program FQHC Services 5220 Claremont Avenue Oakland, CA 94618 Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Our indicator generates a list of patients who meet recommended standard as well as a list of \"non-compliant\" patients who did not get both doses by age 13 but could still be targeted to receive the two dose series prior to their 15th birthday. Providers are given feedback on our rate of completion and offered specific strategies to discuss vaccine hesitancy. Prior to Q4 2016, recommendation was for 3 doses of HPV vaccine. Since Q4 2016, recommendation is for 2 doses of HPV vaccine for patients under age 15, and 3 doses for patients over age 15. Numerator: Number of female patients 13 -15 years during the reporting period who received two doses of Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine with an interval of 6 months, prior to their 13 thbirthday. Denominator: Female patients 13 to 15 years of age with at least one medical visit during the reporting period. 114The purpose of the Critical Care Obstetric Database is two - fold: 1.To evaluate outcomes such as morbidity and mortality and utilization of resources in the obstetric critical care patient population at UCSF Medical Center. 2.A resource for further research, pending all studies that use the database for external publishing are IRB approved. The database will be searchable and facilitate the ability to do chart review on identified subjects. Next Steps:Entering all of the identified patient population data into the database. Analyze the data cumulatively and by year. Identify problem specific research based on findings from database. (i.e. ARDS in pregnant patients, Relationship between ICU delirium and postpartum depression, Timing of DVT prophylaxis, etc). Collaborate with other institutions in evaluating data in this understudied vulnerable population. Dissemination:Share our findings within the Maternal Fetal Medicine, Critical Care and UCSF Health Administration teams to improve resource utilization in this population.Significance: Maternal mortality in the US is uptrending while it has been declining in other developed countries. Lancet 2016 ; 388:1775 -812 Since 2015 UCSF has had an average of 45 to 70 critically obstetric patients admitted to the ICU per year. Current critical care research often excludes the obstetric population from studies due to the physiologic changes of the body and being considered a vulnerable patient population. As such, there is a knowledge and research gap with this population. The Critical Care Medicine Service at UCSF currently does not specifically evaluate outcomes in critically ill obstetric patients.With the data that is collected we plan to evaluate outcomes, severity of illness, and resource utilization in the critically ill population at UCSF to identify how we can better provide care. We hope that this database will help us better understand our sickest obstetric patients and find ways to contribute to decreasing maternal mortality. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium The Critical Care Obstetric Database Erika Wilson, NP Kristina Kordesch, NP Lindsey Huddleston, MD Jeffrey Sperling, MD Karin Clifton, NP Amada Apacible, NP Critical Care Medicine at Mission Bay Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned First, we had to identify the correct patient population. After reviewing current literature and research, we defined our patient population as all antepartum to 6 weeks postpartum patients admitted to any ICU at UCSF. Second, we worked with a health informatics analyst to help us search all ICU admissions since February 1 ,2015 with an OB History and Physical, Consult or Progress Note. We timed the data start point to when we moved the obstetric population to Mission Bay. In creating this database, one of the biggest challenges was trying to determine what data points to collect to better understand our critically obstetric patients and what resources are required to provide the highest quality and safest care. We met with experts in Critical Care and Maternal Fetal Medicine research to determine the most relevant and appropriate data points, but not so many that the data becomes cumbersome. Once the data set was determined, it was submitted to the IRB for approval. We have since taken that data set and created a HIPAA compliant database in REDCap. 115New practices are challenging to implement Staff are already overwhelmed and struggle to maintain consistency Pediatric inpatient setting- Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) No standard for sedation and analgesia for intubated patients Clinical approaches varied significantly High-cost narcotics (e.g., Fentanyl) could be replaced by low -cost morphine for a significant portion of intubated patients RT's lacked sufficient awareness of sedation/analgesia practices, affecting ventilator weaning and management Adult outpatient setting -Tri-City Health Center Key population health measures: colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and opioid safety Lack of clear practice standards Cloud-based Implementation of New Frontline Clinical Workflows Jennie of Pediatrics; 3Tri-City Center PICU Introduce approach to sedation and analgesia for intubated patients Tri-City Health Center Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening for clinic population Improve Opioid Safety for patients with chronic opioid useCritical Care Comfort Algorithm (CALM)Opioid Safety Colorectal Cancer Screening Complex guidelines Standardized workflow Real -time actionable and trackable decision guide Multiple sources Standardized workflow Real -time actionable and trackable decision guide Interprofessional gamified -outInterprofessional roll -out Self-assessment (bottom -up) Charge RN audits (top-down) UCSF Pediatric Critical Care Comfort Algorithm (CALM) Evaluation Trained and empowered MAs to actively participate in opioid safety Providers now have time during the visit to discuss contracts and weaning with patients Impact Opioid contract renewals increased year -over-year from <10/month to 101/month Narcan prescriptions increased from <10/month to 27/monthEvaluation Empowered MAs to perform to \"Top of License\" and off -load Providers Providers now have time to discuss details and benefits of CRC screening with patients Impact 3-week gamified engaged (N=56) >70% increase in CRC screenings PICU expansion with content based on leadership and frontline nursing needs Ongoing tracking of CRC screening, opioid contract, and Narcan prescription volumes at FQHC Roll-out of Hepatitis C screening and treatment guidelines Adoption at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland to standardize workflowsOpioid Safety Colorectal Cancer Screening Evaluation RNs are able to self-assess and self-learn CALM guidelines Charge RNs are able to perform audits and track by shift Impact Example checklist stats: 107 checklists completed in the last intubated and ventilated (N=12/94) 83% of intubated protocol (N=10/12) Special thanks to Arup Roy- Burman, Scott Cohen, Carol Klove, Ed Nanale, Lisa Patricia Dillon, Asunta Pacheco- Kennedy, Stephanie Jullien, Kathleen Clanon, and John Eric Henry.

Adverse social circumstances like food insecurity, housing instability, and discrimination can have dramatic, negative impacts on the health of children . In safety -net settings, the prevalence of these adverse social circumstances is alarmingly high . One study reported that over 90% of urban adolescent girls endorsed having at least one adverse experience, and 85% had specifically witnessed violence in their community (Lipschitz, 2000 ). Another study found that 67% of youth (mean age of 8) screened positive for at least one Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) . (Burke, 2011) . Adversity in children have been correlated with fair or health (Bethell , Newacheck , Hawes, & Halfon , 2014 ; Flaherty et al., 2013 ), illness requiring a doctor (Flaherty et al., 2013 ), fair or poor dental health (Bright, Alford, Hinojosa, Knapp, & Fernandez - Baca, 2015 ), lifetime asthma risk (Bethell et al., ), autism (Bethell et al., 2014 ), and being overweight or obese (Bethell et al., 2014; Burke, Hellman, Scott, Weems, & Carrion, 2011 ). In addition, studies on ACEs during childhood and adolescence have found an association between ACEs and violent behavior (delinquent behavior, bullying, physical fighting, dating violence, weapon -carrying) (Duke, Pettingell , McMorris , & Borowsky , and learning difficulties (Burke et al., 2011) . Given these health outcomes associated with childhood adversity, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement calls on pediatricians to actively screen for childhood trauma and adversity (Garner et al., 2012 ). Pediatric providers offer a unique opportunity for identifying and ameliorating how Pediatricians who see children at regular intervals, are trained to provide anticipatory guidance to prevent and educate families about a wide variety of public health issues, and understand the important role of parents and communities in determining a child's well-being (Garner et al., 2012 ). The FIND program at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (BCHO), consists of two entities ; the help desk known as the FIND desk and the technology tool known as FINDconnect . The FIND desk was initially piloted in 2012 as a special project by a medical student at BCHO, the earliest version of the program sought only to provide interested families with summer activities and resources for their children . Subsequently, Dr. Dayna Long, along with Dr. Laura Gottlieb and team at San Francisco General Hospital conducted 2 randomized trials between 2013 -2016 that demonstrated that technology can be used to effectively screen families for unmet needs, that pairing families with Navigators to provide tailored resources helps to resolve at least 1 unmet social needs and that when at least 1 social needs resolves, child health outcomes improve . (Gottlieb et al 2014 , 2016, 2017) . Beginning in May 2015 , the FIND program transformed from a research project to transform standard clinical care. Hence the birth of the FINDconnect technology tool. FINDconnect is an innovative cloud based platform that empowers patients and care teams to collaboratively address social determinants of health . The primary focus is to treat the preventative, upstream causes of illness in order to reduce health disparities among under -resourced populations and improve the health of families throughout the life course . In 2018 , addressing social determinants of health within the health care setting has become the new practice of care . Through a systems change approach, the FIND program aims to reduce health inequities by partnering with families within the medical home to address social determinants of health . We will engage with, acknowledge and mitigate these factors in order to achieve health equity for all children . FIND will make connecting with resources for social and environmental determinants of health easy and effective for all. The goals of the FIND program are included below : Partnering with : families to identify unmet social and environmental needs providers to treat the root causes of medical problems community -based organizations to expand services within the medical home researchers across the country to facilitate collaborative networks in order to inform evidence -based practices to mitigate the effects of toxic stress and adversity academic institutions to train the next generation of health care professionals in an upstream, multidisciplinary, and preventive approach to care policy makers to provide clinical evidence for advocacy and systems change Shifting the paradigm of medicine to improve population health Improving the health outcomes of children and their families over lifespans Significantly increasing enrollment in community and government programs Implementing team -based care as a medical model through policy change Improve patient satisfaction rates and quality of service provided From 05/01/17 - 4/31/18: Patients screened: 481 Resource referrals provided: 1479 21% of families present with food insecurity and are now connected to navigators to help resolve food insecurity 49% of our families need support finding activities for their children 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium FIND connect Addressing the Social & Environmental Factors that Impact Health Author: Artanesha L.

The EVD is a high- risk, low -frequency device. It was important that everyone using these machines be familiar with the equipment prior to introduction in the PICU. Initial training for the equipment change was a series of traditional in -service trainings. However, the EVDs were delivered 60 days later than expected , and nurses had not retained earlier training. Looking for a more effective alternative, PICU management piloted a cloud -based just-in-time training solution (Elemeno Health, Oakland; a UCSF -backed innovation) to help frontline healthcare teams deliver best practice at the point of care. The training solution applied gamification (the use of gaming mechanics in non- game contexts) to engage users in a specific activity as directed by clinical leadership. Participation was voluntary. . Instead of having restricted opportunities to learn about the new EVDs, our nurses were able to access the critical information when they needed it, right on their own personal devices. Out of the 79 nurses who registered, nearly 70% of the nurses watched both videos. In addition to the contest videos, our nurses also took the opportunity to view Level 1 Rapid Infuser, Codman DirectLink, Manual ICP, and Defibrillator videos (along with other resources) at their own convenience , educating themselves during shift change, on breaks, on the floor, or from home. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Video Microlearning and Gamification to Streamline Unit -based Nurse Training with a New Device Besen B, RN Canty B, RN Konstantin A, RN BCHO PICU BACKGROUND Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation and Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons LearnedThe Plan Given the delayed delivery of the EVD devices, the PICU needed a way for nurses to have knowledge at their disposal , so that they did not rely solely on recall from one -time trainings. Video- based microlearning could capture both verbal and tacit knowledge and provide a way for our nurses to have concise refresher training available on- demand to help ensure correct and standard practice. Interventions Examples of Traditional Training Methods: Infrequent staff meetings (one trainer: large group; not in clinical context) 1:1 in -person in- servicing (resource -and time -consuming) vendor -based collateral (generic; one -off websites; paper handouts) email explanations locally made breakroom posters hurried small group training during shift hand- off. As a result ... Tracking training viewing/participation is difficult, generally relying on paper documentation. Processes are disconnected from actual practice Potential for large gaps of time between training and actual practice negatively affects retention. Challenging to sustain the effect of the initial training over the long term. Objectives: Ensure all ICU nurses (n=100) across three shifts: are aware of the switch understand differences between old and new EVDs to prevent operational errors can refresh their training, on -demand, for low frequency usage Target State for Training: Use a context -driven, microlearning solution to help frontline nurses adhere to the consistent delivery of best practices at the point of care. Capture training in microlearning video PICU recorded two under 3 minute refresher videos walking through the different elements and operational steps of the new machines.Tracking engagement and drive peer -accountability Set up a dynamic contest leaderboard with each team member's name and points visible to the entire team. This allowed team members to use peer accountability.Disseminate practice across nursing staff To leverage the competitive spirit among shifts, we set up a two -week contest, with approximately 30 nurses per shift/team. Nurses earned points for their teams by viewing each video once. Curate and host approved video on accessible unit and institution -specific site Final versions approved by BCHO PICU leadership, hosted on BCHO Elemeno site and accessible on any web- enabled device. Since completion of the pilot, we have created over ten microlearning videos, including Intra-Abdominal Pressure Monitoring, Cytotoxic Drug Administration, and Tracheostomy Tube Suctioning. Our staff nurses have since viewed videos (along with other resources) on -demand at their own convenience , educating themselves on the floor, during shift change, on breaks, or from home. The just -in-time training has been formally adopted in the ICU and is scaling to additional units/specialties in BCHO. Another site for the training solution is live at BCSHF PCICU, and specific video microlearning content is being shared between institutions. High-quality videos can be created with personal mobile devices. Audio availability may be limited at the bedside; adding subtitles to videos can allow for an effective visual learning experience without sound. Workstation access was facilitated by addition of a shortcut icon While nurses found desktop access doable, expansion to mobile access increased accessibility; even at the bedside,nurses access content without interrupting EHR workflows. 118Next Steps: Integration of the \"Fall Prevention Reminders\" flier into OneView and APeX EHR system is underway to streamline provision of patient education. Once live, the education document will automatically populate under the education tab once the nurse activate a falls nursing care plan in APeX. Dissemination:The \"Falls Tip of the Week\" sheets can be made available online to all inpatient units for use in reminding staff to educate patients and families on falls prevention. Collaborations with other children's hospitals can also facilitate greater impact on falls reduction and improvement of current educational efforts. Lessons Learned: Translation of the \"Fall Prevention Reminders\" sheet to languages other than English and Spanish would also be beneficial and lead to greater cultural competency. Patient falls are a significant issue in hospitals because of their prevalence and the injury they can inflict, which ranges from minor to serious. Children especially are often at increased risk for falls due to developmental changes related to learning to walk, impulsivity, and affinity for independence. Consequently, consistent use of falls prevention measures is needed to keep patients safe and free from injury. This projects aligns with the UCSF True North Pillars of Quality & Safety and Patient Experience, which strive to achieve zero harm. While the FY17 fall rate of 1.13 per 1,000 patient days shows that BCH is meeting its target fall rate of 1.37 per 1,000 patient days, data reveals BCH is only 89% compliant with established falls process measures. Thus, a quality improvement project using posted reminders was developed and executed in two of BCH's acute care units: C5 Med/Surg, C5 Marrow Transplant & C6 Hematology/Oncology . The goal of this project was to prevent patient falls and improve falls process measures that were not meeting target goal of > 90%. In particular, the falls process measure of \"Patient/Family Education\" was the main focus as FY17 compliance for BCH was 74% . Other underperforming measures (86%) and \"Nursing Care Plan Active\" (80%).Project impact was evaluated using UCSF QualDash data. While improvements cannot be attributed to this intervention specifically, FY18 data through three quarters shows a BCH fall rate of 0.93 per 1000 patient days, representing a decrease of 0.20 from FY17. Additionally, \"Patient/Family Education\" compliance improved to 87% , to FY17, while \"Fall Indicators\" and Care Plan to 98% and 88% , respectively, in FY18. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Improving Patient & Family Education to Prevent Pediatric In-Patient Falls Jennifer Miller, BSN, RN-BC, Barbette Care, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital - Mission Bay Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned A \"Fall Prevention Reminders\" sheet was created and posted in all in- patient rooms in BCH. This functioned as a list of teaching points for nursing staff to reference during admission and hourly rounding. Starting July 24, 2017, a CN III implemented additional \"Falls Tip of the Week\" fliers designed to serve as easy -to-read reminders for nurses and staff about falls prevention strategies. \"Falls Tip of the Week\" sheets were posted in shared spaces such as breakrooms and conference rooms and rotates periodically. Falls prevention education were included during Annual Skills Validation for all BCH acute care nurses in September of 2017. 119A. Describe the COMPASS patient population. B.

Ensure RN and PCA staff are oriented to indwelling urinary catheter care expectations. Ensure RN and PCA staff have awareness about CAUTI and our reduction efforts. Reinforce available fecal management strategies. Spread and reinforce best practice of performing urine culture only if urinalysis meets specific criteria . Next Steps: Continue reinforcement of indwelling urinary catheter care technique. Continue reinforcement of fecal management strategies. Continue to explore effective alternatives to the use of indwelling urinary catheters. Reinforce proper technique to obtain clean catch urine for samples. Pilot the use of a nursing algorithm to remove urinary catheters. Dissemination : Success from this work has been disseminated to organizational leadership, unit leadership, and staff. Lessons Learned: Patient Care Assistants are key members of the care team for CAUTI reduction initiatives, yet are often left out of education campaigns. \"Back to basics\" campaigns are often overlooked as a source of positive change. This work illustrates that this is not always the case. Hospital-wide efforts to reduce Catheter- associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI) began in 2012 with the introduction of CAUTI Prevention Care Bundles. Initially in FY13, the bundle compliance among adult nursing units was at 62% but by FY15 had improved and plateaued at 87% or better. From FY13 through FY15, there was a 23% reduction in the annual CAUTI rate among adult nursing units. But from FY15 to FY17, the annual CAUTI rate fluctuated but did not demonstrate sustained improvement despite stable bundle compliance. During this time a number of barriers to CAUTI reduction were identified:Urine culture samples were ordered and sent simultaneously with urinalysis samples. Inconsistent adherence to appropriate reasons for keeping an indwelling urinary catheter. Majority of bacteria found in urine cultures suggested contamination from stool. Successful interventions piloted in one unit (Neuro ICU) during FY17 had potential to be spread more widely. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium \"Back to Basics\" Initiative to Reduce CAUTI among Inpatient Adults Amy Larsen, RN, MS, CNS Institute for Nursing Excellence Peter Kolonoski, RN, MSN, CIC Hospital Epidemiology & Infection Control Carrie R. Meer, RN, MS, CPHQ Nursing Performance Improvement UCSF Medical Center | UCSF Health Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Interventions: 1:1 education across multiple patient care units of perineal/urinary catheter care to RN and Patient Care Assistant (PCA) staff by RN CAUTI champions that included: Use of a standardized care \"check- list\" to ensure the same care was being taught to all staff. CAUTI education and awareness content. Fecal management strategies, particularly for patients with fecal incontinence. Use of groin task trainer to allow for simulated care outside of view of patient or families. Collaboration between nursing, providers and clinical lab services to begin performing urine culture only if urinalysis results meet specific criteria. New culturing criteria went into effect on 12/13/2017. Focused rounding asking nurses to speak to the indication of continued need for indwelling urinary catheter to support appropriate use. The CAUTI Prevention Care Bundle is comprised of the following components: Catheter secured to avoid pulling and dislodgement. Tubing looped to allow free flow of urine to gravity. Urinary catheter system intact without any breaks or open ports. Drainage bag below level of bladder. Drainage bag and tubing not on floor. Drainage bag level kept below 2/3rds full. Documentation of daily perineal or foley care. Documentation of daily screening of need for catheter based on national standards of appropriate catheter use. Monthly bundle compliance is measured through direct observations of the condition of the indwelling urinary catheter system and documented care on each adult nursing unit. Bundle compliance is the percentage of observations that found all elements of the bundle to be in compliance with standards of care. If one or more of the bundle elements is not compliant, then no credit is received for that observation. In FY18, there has been a 32% reduction in the annual CAUTI rate among inpatient adults from a rate of 2.41 in FY17 to the current rate of 1.64 in FY18 as of April 2018. Over 400 RNs and PCAs have been trained to date on this standardized checklist for care. The number of urine cultures processed per month decreased from an average of 636 cultures/month in the 6 months prior to the change in urine culturing criteria to 360 cultures/month in the 4 months after the change, a 43% reduction ! 121In the field of nephrology, being able to actively manage our patients is particularly crucial during early stages of chronic kidney disease (Elaine, CJASN 2018). When patients receive suboptimal care, individuals with poorly controlled DM or hypertension experience 20% (1.8/7.9) and 80% (6.1/7.9) less time in early stage CKD -- more rapid progression of kidney disease: My goal is to reduce the % of lost to follow up patients to less than 5%.Next Steps: -Create an automatic monthly LTFU report, call patient, and update \"no call\" list system -Implement support APEX feature Dissemination: -UCSF Health Symposium Poster Presentation -Discuss with other chronic disease management clinics regarding successes and suggestions -Implement in Rheumatology clinic Lessons Learned: -We lack data about patient outcomes following LTFU. -Developing this system is time- and effort -intensive and lacks reimbursementReducing the number of patients \"lost to follow - up\" (LTFU) is a cornerstone of achieving the \"triple aim\" of reducing health care costs, increasing health care quality, and improving the health of the community at large. The positive effect of retention in care and adherence to therapy has been best studied in HIV care and can be extrapolated to management of other chronic diseases (Sebastian, AIDS Behav 2014). In nephrology, continuity of care is particularly important for patients who are transitioning from chronic kidney disease care to renal replacement therapy and has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality (Ifudu, AJKD 1996). At our tertiary academic Nephrology and Hypertension Faculty Practice, we identified that approximately 23% of patients seen in 2016 had been instructed to return to clinic but did not within 4 weeks beyond the requested date. It has been shown that individuals with CKD who do not receive optimal therapy have more rapid progression to ESRD (Elaine, CJASN 2018). If we are able to reduce the number of patients who are lost to follow up, we can improve both quality of care, patient experience, and patient outcomes. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Developing a System to Track and Reinstate Patients Lost to Follow -Up Nephrology Clinic Lead: Lowell Lo MD Nephrology Clinic Team Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned oWHAT : 1) Create a system to identify patients who have missed a follow -up appointment in nephrology 2) Determine the reasons for patients' missing their appointments 3) Schedule patients for appropriate clinic follow -up oWHO :1) Clinic director evaluates scale of problem; works with APEX team to generate necessary report; encourages MD participation to track patient follow -up appointment timing using \"follow -up button\" tool in \"Wrap Up\" section of APEX; audit accuracy of report. 2) Nurse manager and team convert APEX report into patient call list; call patients directly and schedul e appointments as necessary oWHERE: UCSF Nephrology and Hypertension Faculty Practice oWHEN: oHOW : Team Huddle, APEX report review and True North Board rounds (at least monthly) *Sensitivity Analysis -436 \"no show\" patients from 05/2017 to Create Reports Audit Reports Test Call Backs Encourage MD Participation Formalize Call BacksReducing Lost to Follow Up Timeline Target = <5% of our patients will be LTFU Current = 3.76% Target = >95% will use the follow up button feature Current = 76.5% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90% June July August Sept- Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar AprilNephrology Clinic LTFU % LTFU % Used 1221.100% of staff will have the skills, tools, and knowledge to provide high-quality and efficient care for pediatric patients living with ASD. 2.Improved assessment protocols and tools will be instituted to better identify patients with ASD and improves staff awareness of these patients. 3.Parents and caregivers will have sufficient tools to optimally prepare for their perioperative appointments. Next Steps: Continue Staff Education with Juvo Behavioral Health. Assess the effectiveness of the resource bundle in the long term, comparing 2018's surgical delays with 2017's data. Integrate the Parent Questionnaire into EMR. Dissemination:With continued PDSA, the resource bundle can be rolled out system -wide, tailoring the individual resources to the needs of each unit. In addition, \"larger- scale\" behavioral health services models can be adopted into the unit, supported through grants and other funding. Lessons Learned: Making visible the patient's behavioral needs and providing training and resources for staff can improve the patient experience as well as improve throughput and reduce OR downtown.17.8% of pediatric perioperative patients at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland had a behavioral diagnosis (2017). Using Lean tools, mapping and A3 thinking, it was identified that patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were not adequately prepared for the environment, processes, and people they would encounter. Lack of individualized care for children with ASD, accompanied by communication deficits, lack of staff training, and inadequate identification of ASD diagnoses, resulted in significant delays, OR down -time, poor patient satisfaction, and potential safety issues for patients and staff. In 2017 this resulted in 5455 delayed case hours at a cost of $14 million . -55% of staff surveyed reported a patient behavioral crisis resulting in delayed care. -97% of staff wanted specialized training to manage challenging behaviors. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Optimizing Care for Pediatric Patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Perioperative Services Using Lean Tools and A3 Thinking to Improve Workflow Scout E.

Staff Education : The staff education is planned for April 2018. Initial response to this opportunity has been positive across nurses, technicians, and physicians within the perioperative unit. Participation and engagement is expected to be high, which should correlate to an improvement of staff preparedness in caring for the target population. Questionnaire: A pilot implementation of the Parent Questionnaire was conducted in Perioperative Admissions. 35 families were randomly selected over 3 days and were given the questionnaire to fill out along with the post -questionnaire Li kert Scale effectiveness survey. More than 66% of all families responded positively to the questionnaire across all metrics. Toolkits & At -A-Glance: Toolkits were implemented in the perioperative units and on the hospital's website. Positive feedback was given by The Family Advisory Council, the Nursing Leader and Quality Council, and staff who work in the unit. Staff Education: Initial response to this opportunity has been positive across nurses, technicians, and physicians within the perioperative Unit. Participation and engagement is expected to be high, which should correlate to an improvement of staff preparedness in car ing for The target population.A resource bundle was developed including a Parent Questionnaire, Perioperative ASD Toolkits for staff and parents, and an At -A-Glance reference for staff. 1232018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium PICU Cares about Cost : Increasing Staff Awareness of Supply Costs in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit PICU Experience Workgroup: RN; Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned The PICU Experience Workgroup (PEWG) is a multidisciplinary committee which leads improvement projects on the unit based on the UCSF True North Pillars. During the Financial Strength Pillar discussion, unit -specific data from UCSF Finance was presented. It was noted by the team that knowledge of and access to supply cost data was not readily available to staff. The PEWG utilized the 5 Why's exercise to better understand why the problem existed (see below) and did a pre -survey of staff to determine the severity of the issue. This problem has a considerable impact to UCSF as the PICU demonstrated that staff is unaware of how much supply items that they use every day cost which could contribute to waste and overuse of unnecessary supplies. Our target goal was to increase staff awareness of cost associated with supplies used in the PICU for RNs and PCA's by 20% by June 2018. Usage and cost of pulse oximeter \"pulse ox\" probes and Z -flopositioners were the metrics used. Our current state for usage of pulse -ox probes per patient was 3.3. Z -flousage was 0.35 per patient. \"Awareness\" was defined as correct selection of price for chosen supplies: pulse ox probes & Z - flopositioners and an increase in the degree to which cost influences decision making when choosing supplies.Next Steps: Next steps for this project include expanding the interventions and surveys to other members of the PICU team including Physicians and Respiratory Therapists. We also plan to develop education and awareness campaigns focused on other items that are high cost or have high rates of inappropriate use leading to waste . Based on the results of our post- test survey which asked many in -process metric questions, we will continue to provide staff meeting education and use posters/flyers to disseminate information to staff for our next PDSA. Dissemination:This improvement project to easily be replicated in other unit focusing on the same products or other ones of particular importance for that unit.Lessons Learned: Interest in limiting unnecessary cost and waste is a priority among most members of the PICU team as shown in our survey. However, barriers continue to exist related to lack of awareness about cost as well as other issues such as job- related and time constraints. As a team, we felt that utilizing better pre -intervention data in regards to Z -flouse would have also been helpful.A survey was provided to PICU RNs and PCAs before and after the intervention. Twenty -eight people participated in the pre -intervention survey and twenty -six people participated in the post -intervention survey. We noted an overall increase in awareness of cost related to pulse ox probes with an increased number of staff recognizing the correct cost. Additionally, our utilization of pulse -ox probes in the PICU decreased from 3.3 to 1.8 probes per patient. Figure 1: Responses to selected questions from survey done pre -and post intervention: Figure 2: Impact of different interventions' Figure 3: Pulse Ox Probe Utilization- Pre/Post on decision- making on post- intervention surveyAfter utilizing the Five Why's problem solving tactic, the PEWG concluded that lack of awareness around how much supplies cost was a problem that needed to be addressed in the PICU. Our project was planned around the assertion that increasing awareness of supply cost among staff would lead to a decrease in supply use, and ultimately an overall reduction in cost per case in the PICU. We planned to focus our interventions on two specific supplies frequently used in the unit based on high cost and usage: oxygen saturation probes and Z -flopositioners. The implementation plan for this project was executed in stages including pre-intervention cost analysis for each item, distribution of a staff pre -test survey, a \"Did You Know\" Cost Awareness Campaign with posters and signs in high traffic areas, staff presentation/education at a staff meeting, a post- test survey, and post -intervention cost analysis. 02468101214161820 Price tag stickers Posters/Flyers Presentation at staff meetingSurvey No influence on my decisionsResponses (n)Which interventions influenced your decisions in choosing supplies? 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% None at all A little A moderate amountA lot A great dealTo what extent does cost influence your decision making when supplies? $40) Price difference, probes vs stickersHow much more expensive are oxygen saturation probes compared to replacement stickers Pre-intervention Post-intervention 00.511.522.533.5 Pre-Intervention (Feb 2017 - April 2017)Post-Intervention (Feb 2018 - April 2018)Number of Pulse Ox probes per patientPulse Ox Probe Utilization 124Primary Objective: To determine the rate of post -treatment hypoglycemia after implementation of the revised orderset . Goal - further reduce hypoglycemia rate post insulin for hyperkalemia treatment using clinical decision support and targeting independent risk factors: -Insulin dose >0.14 units/kg hypoglycemia rates: dL) = 21% Severe hypoglycemia rate ( <40mg/ dL) = 5% Secondary Objective: To identify possible gaps that could contribute to hypoglycemia post -insulin treatment for hyperkalemia in regards to: Provider compliance with Insulin for hyperkalemia ordered via adult inpatient hyperkalemia orderset Nursing compliance to the adult inpatient hyperkalemia orders for 4 POCT glucoses within 6 hours post insulin and a repeat d50 IV 1 hour post insulin Next Steps: 1.Publish : see Dissemination 2.Identify ways to further reduce hypoglycemia A. Identify a plan to further protect patients with CrCL <30ml/min from hypoglycemia . 3. Identify ways to further improve provider and RN compliance: A. Improve provider compliance to ordering insulin for hyperkalemia via the Hyperkalemia orderset i. Increase from 77% to 100% - ACTION: EPIC upgrade in 2017 provided transparency to insulin ordersets B. Improve RN compliance to checking POCT glucose and administering a repeat d50 IV if ordered. i. Increase from 61% to 100% - ACTION: Linked 2 d50 IV orders; clarified d50 administration order C. Improve compliance with Luer Lok insulin (unit) syringe 100 unit/1mL. 4. National campaign to re -evaluate the 2005 AHA guidelines for emergent electrolyte imbalances (Hyperkalemia ) Dissemination : 1.ADA Scientific Sessions 2018 - poster presentation 2.JAMA 5/2018 letter to the editor on reducing hypoglycemia events through standardizing syringe 3.Publication pending on research data and request to re -evaluate 2005 AHA guidelines for hyperkalemia treatment. Lessons Learned: 1.Clinical decision support can be a powerful tool in identifying patients at risk for hypoglycemia and preventing hypoglycemia events. 2.Despite improved clarity around insulin ordersets , post insulin POCT glucose and repeat d50 orders, there is still room for improvement in educating providers and nurses to optimize APeX navigation and compliance. Hyperkalemia (serum potassium 5.1 mEq /L), if left untreated, may result in cardiac arrhythmias, severe muscle weakness, or paralysis. [1,2] Hypoglycemia in the inpatient setting is associated with higher mortality and increased length in hospital stay. [3] One treatment option for acute severe hyperkalemia is to shift serum potassium intracellularly through insulin administration. [4] Treatment of hyperkalemia with insulin is not benign and leads to significant rates of hypoglycemia (blood glucose <70 mg/dl), approximately 8.7% to 13% for studies lacking mandatory glucose checks. [5 -6] At the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center (UCSFMC), utilizing a UCSFMC adult inpatient hyperkalemia revised orderset (Orderset that requires blood glucose point -of-care testing (POCT) pre-insulin administration and post -insulin administration (1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post -insulin), we uncovered a hypoglycemia rate of 21%. Through mandatory glucose checks, we found that 92% of these hypoglycemic episodes occurred within 3 hours of insulin administration. In addition, we identified risk factors for hypoglycemia, including decreased renal function (creatinine clearance <30mL/min), high doses of insulin (>0.14 units/kg) and pre -treatment blood glucose <140 mg/ dL. As a result of these finding, we developed and implemented a new revised orderset (Orderset 1.2) that included: 1) weight -based dosing of insulin options, 2) provider alerts to identify patients at higher risk of hypoglycemia, and tools to help guide decision making based on the pre -insulin blood glucose measured for a hyperkalemic patient. [7] Currently, Orderset 1.2 is the only active version. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Study Design: Cross -sectional study, using patient data from UCSFMC from January 1, 2016 to March 19, 2017 ( Orderset 1.1) and then March 20, 2017 to September 30, 2017 ( Orderset 1.2) for patients administered insulin for hyperkalemia treatment. Inclusion Criteria: Patients who received insulin for treatment of hyperkalemia through the revised orderset [Figure 1] POCT glucose level pre -insulin administration and post -insulin administration Within 4 hours prior to insulin Within 30 minutes to 180 minutes (0.5 - 3 hours) after insulin Within >180 minutes to 360 minutes (3 - 6 hours) after treatment insulin Exclusion Criteria: Patients without 3 or more unique POCT levels as listed in inclusion Patients receiving multiple insulin treatments for hyperkalemia within 6 hours, the first treatment data points were excluded to prevent duplication of data Measurements: Glucose levels before and for 6 hours after insulin injection. serum creatinine prior to treatment, weight, known diagnosis o f diabetes, use of albuterol and corticosteroids, and insulin dose given for treatment of hyperkalemia Data Analysis : Statistical analysis for our data includes 2 for nominal data Student t test for continuous data. Bivariable analysis identified potential risk factors and protective factors for hypoglycemia and logistic regression determined independent predictors of hypoglycemia. Through bivariable analyses, any factor that revealed a p -value below 0.05 was included in the multivariable analyses to investigate significant contribution to hypoglycemia outcomes. All analyses were rendered utilizing Stata version 14 (Stata Corp LLC, College Station, Texas). Hyperkalemia Orderset Version 1.1 (12/2015) Features Included: 1.

ISMP and Joint Commission recommend an independent double check prior to administration of high risk medications, including insulin. 2. However, ISMP and Joint Commission acknowledge that with the increase in volume of high risk medications, institutions should require independent double check for very selective high- alert medications., not all high- alert medications. Lessons Learned: Wrong patient insulin pen alerts have allowed us to detect and evaluate compliance discrepancies to our patient medication administration policies -Over 50 RNs identified as carrying more than 2 patients' medications at a time since 4/2017. Early interventions have aided in course correction. EVALUATION of removal of 2 RN double check for SQ Insulin: 1.Improved interval between POCT glucose and SQ Insulin 2.More patients with POCT glucose within due time 3.More patients with SQ Insulin within 30 minutes of POCT glucose 4. Less RN Interruption 5. Reduced waste ( gloves, gowns, masks) 6.

Working with Nursing Clinical Informatics and Unit Nurse Leaders to provide dashboard reports of medication administration wrong patient alerts to help patient safety and establish timely identification of policy non- compliance to patient medication administration practices and provide course correction. Despite the technological advancement of multi - dose injectable pen over vial and syringe for both patients and clinicians, there are biohazard risks that must be considered when developing injection technique expectations. The FDA in 2009 put out a warning stating that regurgitation of blood into the insulin cartridge after injection can occur creating a risk if used on more than one patient.

Goal 1: Keep using insulin pens for greater dosing accuracy: Since the majority of rapid acting insulin is 3 units or less at UCSF Health for adult patients, the insulin pen is known to provide greater accuracy for small doses. . Goal 2: Keep insulin pens on the nursing units. Rapid acting insulin is a time- critical medication and optimize pharmacy technology where possible to prevent medication delays Goal 3. Create patient -specific barcode label on units for multi- dose medications dispensed from automated dispensing machines ( Pyxis).. *EPIC customization developed by Andrew Maruoka Goal 4: Remove 2RN double check of SQ insulin for adults without increasing risk of wrong patient insulin pen administration * EPIC Alerts built by Craig San LuisIt's not about single use needles -- The Insulin Pen technology relies on a 2 way needle that access the insulin in the pen cartridge and inject into the patient. After the insulin SQ injection, there is a possibility of biological regurgitation back into the insulin in the cartridge from the patient This work creates the potential risk of blood borne pathogen contamination if a patient shares an insulin pen with another patient that carries blood borne pathogens. 127SMART Goal: Maintain BCH TCU discharge by noon rate > 20% 10 out of 12 months by June 1, 2018.

The discharge process for inpatients TCU is lengthy and inefficient. It impacts a few of our UCSF True North Pillars: December 2016, Discharge Workflow Improvement Group was implemented. Developed an A3, performed process map of discharge workflow, developed interventions to target discharge efficiency. March 2017, a daily discharge huddle was implemented to create a shared understanding of discharge needs. It has now been ingrained into the workflow. Each patient is discussed with anticipated discharge date and needs identified. Key team members attend and needs are specified by role. March 2017-December 2017, resulted in increase in discharge by noon rate from 15% to 20%. QUALITY & SAFETY : Serious safety events resulting in readmissions back to the unit have occurred in part due to the complexity and inefficient coordination of the discharge. PATIENT EXPERIENCE : Time series observations (N=7) conducted in TCU in January 2017 indicated a discharge lag time of up to 5 hrs. Families rated the Press Ganey \"felt ready for discharge\" at a mean score of 89% FY17, which is at the 49th percentile nationally. 2019 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Road to Discharge Improving Discharge for Pediatric Transitional Care Patients Improving the Family Experience Discharge Workflow Improvement Workgroup Team Leaders: Deb Franzon MD, Jessie Members: Michael Spiegel; Dinarte Kangwankij BSN RN; Deborah MSN Valerie MA BSN RN; Tamara Fitzpatrick MSN RN Advisory Sponsors: Kim Scurr MPA RN, Steve Wilson MD C5Transitional Care Unit/BCH Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Using UCSF LEAN methodologies and an A3 approach to continuous process improvement, convened a multidisciplinary workgroup to meet biweekly per project timeline (Fig 1).

Same -day accessioning ranged from 45% to 77% during this period. (Figure 1) The project goal is to achieve same -day accessioning of 70% of the cases on a routine monthly basis, as well as 80% by the next- day, and the remainder by the third- day. Next Steps:Maintain the culture of accessioning cases within 24 hours by prioritizing cases and cross training additional personnel. Dissemination: Communication between team members, as well as cross training, creates strong team morale and productivity. Lessons Learned: Shortage of staff caused an imbalance in case load among three different sites. Assigning staff to each site improved the balance. Consistent daily communication between the consult team enhanced shifting work loads to different sites to reduce delays. Consultation cases received in Pathology from outside institutions must be accessioned in a timely manner to allow for optimal patient care. The goal is to accession 70% of cases on the same -day, 80% by the next -day and the remainder by the third- day. Historically, approximately 60% of consult cases were accessioned on the day of receipt; however, in some cases, accessioning was delayed 3 or more days due to missing information, insurance authorization delays, short staffing, or inefficient processes. Same day processing from April 2016 to Feb 2017 was achieved only by 27% of the time. (Table 3) From July 2017 to December 2017, same- day accessioning was achieved 100% of the time.(Table 2, 3) Consistent communication and team work proved to be the key to success in improving pathology consultation registration and accessioning turn- around- time. Through improved communication, case workload can be evenly distributed to reduce bottlenecks. 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Timely Accessioning of Consultation Cases Adsuara -Lim T, Fabular V, Upston L, Oo K, Morken T, Nguyen S, Gill R Department of Pathology Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Correct information: A tip sheet was created and provided to clinics outlining requirements for requesting a pathology consultation, minimizing trouble -shooting by staff. Administration reorganization: Consultation accessioning currently performed at all 3 campuses.

Improve Overall OR time by 20% over one year. Next Steps:Lean methodology may be successfully applied to posterior cervical spine surgery whereby improvements in the perioperative anesthetic process is associated with significantly increased OR efficiency. We will apply our changes to other neurosurgical procedures and assess for improvements in OR efficiency.Dissemination:Our work has important implications for multiple stakeholders including for clinicians, patients, and hospitals. We identified areas of posterior cervical spinal surgery that are inefficient and implemented strategies for increased efficiency. Broad implementation of these strategies may improve operative workload and hospital revenue.Lessons Learned: It is critical to confirm \"buy- in\" from all involved stakeholders (e.g., perioperative anesthesia staff, nursing staff, radiology technicians, etc.) so that lean implementation is effective.Lean management strategies aim to increase efficiency by eliminating waste or by improving processes to optimize value. These strategies may be applied toward improving efficiency in the neurosurgical operating room (OR). Specifically, targeting strategies that may streamline OR turnover time may increase operative productivity and improve profitability. We observed that perioperative anesthesia took longer than the surgery itself. We recorded the perioperative anesthesia times in 15 posterior cervical surgeries, and the process on average took 88 minutes In the present study, we applied lean methodology for perioperative anesthesia associated with posterior cervical spine surgeries to assess for associations with OR efficiency. Regarding patient characteristics, there were no differences between the two groups with regards to age (65.1 \u00b13.0 vs. 25.9 \u00b11.1, p=0.89). After the implementation of lean strategies, there was a statistically significant decrease in time of the overall perioperative anesthesia process (88.4 \u00b1 4.7 vs. 76.2 \u00b13.2 min, p=0.04). This was driven by significant decreases in the following steps: Transport and Setup (10.4 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 8.0 \u00b1 0.7 min, p= 0.03) and Positioning (20.8 \u00b12.1 vs. 15.7 \u00b11.3 min, p= 0.046). The time of the remaining steps did not significantly differ between Groups 1 and 2. Of note, total time spent in the operating room (i.e., from room entrance to exit) was lower for Group 2 (270.1 \u00b1 14.6 vs. 252.8 \u00b114.1 min) but the result was not statistically significant (p =0.40). 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Perioperative Anesthesia Lean Implementation is Associated with Increased Operative Efficiency in Posterior Cervical Surgeries Simon Neurological Surgery 2Department of Anesthesia/Perioperative Care Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned We identified 7 key steps in the perioperative anesthesia process: Transport & Setup, Induction, Line/Foley/Neuromonitoring, Positioning, Incision Planning, Prep and Drape and Time Out. Description of these steps are outlined in Table 1. Before lean implementation, we recorded the durations for each of the 7 key steps across 15 patients (Group 1, pre- implementation). We identified areas where lean improvements could be applied. Lean methods that were implemented are shown in Table 1. After lean implementation, we recorded the durations for each of the 7 key steps across 15 patents (Group 2, post -implementation).

Subgroup analyses showed a clinically significant improvement in time to therapeutic anticoagulation among obese patients, although in a small population. Next Steps:Continue to work with the interprofessional team to determine whether further protocol refinement is needed. Explore the impact of increased bolus dosing on time within therapeutic range. Determine if the auto -population of starting doses by indication impacted outlying dose errors (e.g. 18 units/hour intending 18 units/kg/hour). Further evaluate the protocol's impact in an adequately powered sample of obese patients. Dissemination : This study may be repeated in excluded populations or other anticoagulants to determine if similar findings can be applied. House -wide implementation and coordination with infusion pump library update could be scalable to other high -risk updates. Lessons Learned: Implementation of a house -wide algorithm can be accomplished with an interprofessional team. The gold standard for unfractionated heparin infusions is achieving a therapeutic aPTT at 24 hours Prior medication use evaluation data demonstrated room for improvement in achieving time to therapeutic aPTT and appropriate initial bolus when indicated A revised, weight -based heparin dosing nomogram was implemented in May 2017 Safety of anticoagulants is a Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal, and safety improvements are consistent with UCSF True North pillars According to the CDC, the proportion of the US population with obesity continues to rise, necessitating formal strategies for dosing in this patient population-Time to therapeutic aPTT was similar between groups in intent to treat (ITT) and Per Protocol (PP ) analyses -Significant improvements were demonstrated in process measures in all subgroups 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Implementation and evaluation of a weight -based heparin dosing protocol Ellen 1.Dept of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy 2.Dept of Pharmaceutical Services, UCSF Health 3.Medication Outcomes Center, School of Pharmacy 4.Institute for Nursing Excellence, UCSF Health 5.Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine Background Intervention ( cont ) and Project Plan Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned *Excluded from per protocol analysis VAD = Ventricular Assist Device -Extracorporeal = 81Post-Cohort n= 166Pre-Cohort n = 177 ITT n = 109ITT n = 99 ITT= Intention to Treat PP= Per Protocol Pre (n = 12)Post (n = 8)p-value Therapeutic aPTT reached 24h33% 62% Sex: Male Patient height (cm), mean (SD) Actual body weight (kg), mean (SD) Dosing weight (kg), mean (SD) Indication associated with initial heparin order: DVT/PEAtrial fibrillation w/ high stroke riskHigh risk of bleeding ACS Mechanical heart valve Vascular thrombolysis ECMO/ECLS Other Baseline aPTT (4%) 14 (17%) to Population PP Population All IndicationsPre (n = 109)Post 65)p-valuePre (n = Intervention Heparin infusion order sets were consolidated and updated from a fixed dose to a weight -based heparin dosing and titration algorithm Pre Order Set Post Order Set -Manually calculated/entered by physician -Non weight -based starting dose -Autopopulated in the order set -Weight -based starting dose 132 #UCSFHealthImprove2018 UCSF Health & Graduate Medical Education: Resident & Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Projects UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Smoking Cessation Screening & Education in the Cardiac Cath lab Team: Cardiology Lead Fellows: Blake Faculty Mentor: Krishan Soni , MD Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Tobacco use contributes to the global burden of cardiovascular disease. Prevalence of smoking among Californian Adults was 11.6% in 2014 according to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1988- 2014 Therefore, reduction of smoking rates are an important aim at both the public health and individual level. Systematic screening of patients for tobacco use and provision of counseling and cessation resources for active smokers have been shown to reduce the use of tobacco products. UCSF has prioritized tobacco cessation by implementing systematic screening and cessation counseling for adult inpatients. Outpatients referred for coronary angiography have significantly higher baseline cardiovascular risk as compared with the general population and therefore would particularly benefit from tobacco screening. However, these patients are not systematically screened for active tobacco use and are rarely offered cessation counseling. Goal #1: Screen at least 80% of adult outpatients referred to the UCSF cardiac catheterization lab for coronary angiography for active tobacco use. Goal #2: Provide at least 80% of patients who self -identify as active tobacco users withbrief counseling as to the importance of smoking cessation and printed resources for further assistance with cessation.Next Steps: Our immediate next step will be to collect and integrate data from the 4thquarter to ensure our screening and counseling rates remain high. Given the low prevalence of active smokers in our target patient cohort, the crucial next steps will be to determine wheth er the unexpectedly low number of active smokers to whom counseling was delivered justifies the provider -level workload necessary to continue carrying out the project in future years. Dissemination: All outpatient procedures performed at UCSF Medical Center require a pre -procedure H&P , and thus dissemination to other departme nts and settings could be performed in a relatively straightforward fashion by adapting our SmartPhrase to the respective H&P template. Lessons Learned: The most unexpected aspect of our project thus far was the surprisingly low number of active smokers who ultimately received counseling due to the lower than expected smoking prevalence, despite succeeding in our goals of screening and counseling the majority of patients in our target cohort. Potential explanations for this include inaccurate reporting/data collection and/or a real dis crepancy between our expected and real -world smoking prevalence. We performed two quality control checks by independently reviewing individual Apex charts during a given month to verify current smoking status using documentation outside the cath lab visit. We found no cases during the two months reviewed in which current smoking was documented in Apex outside the pre -cath H&P . Plausible explanations for a smoking prevalence lower than projected include possible referral bias -outpatients patients referred to o ur cath lab may be less likely to be active smokers than would be expected based on data published by the Department of Health pertaining to California smoking rates (11.6% in 2014). Additionally, we observed a very high proportion of patients who had been referred for angiography as a component of evaluation for solid -organ transplantation. While we did not formally collect data on this in orde r to precisely quantify, our estimate is that roughly 1/3 of patients in our target cohort met this criteria. The true smoking pre valence in this subgroup would undoubtedly be 0% as active smoking would preclude transplant candidacy. Integrate tobacco screening & counseling into the daily cath lab workflow. Fellows educated about importance of screening & counseling. Identified tobacco cessation as a departmental priority. Document current tobacco use status into pre- procedure H&P. Aid provider compliance by providing reminder for tobacco use. Provide a reliable mechanism for measuring provider compliance. Create standardized tobacco cessation materials to provide smokers. Ensure that all tobacco users are provided with high quality information about cessation resources (pictured right) Standardizing resources is also optimally efficient from workflow perspective. As shown in the bar graph to the left, our group was successful in meeting the project's prespecified improvement targets. Specifically, we achieved a 98.6% rate of screening outpatients for current smoking and a 92% rate of providing smoking cessation counseling to those patients who screened positive for active smoking -both of which were greater than the 80% target rate for both objectives. 1st Quarter2nd Quarter3rd QuarterTotals Number LHCs 149 143 139 160 442 Number smokers 6 4 4 14 Number counseled 6 4 3 13While our group achieved both project goals, our data revealed a surprisingly low prevalence of active smoking in our target patient population. Of 442 patients screened, just 3.2% self- identified as active smokers. Therefore despite high rates of both screening and counseling, a net total of just 13 active smokers received counseling throughout the first 3 quarters of the year. 133UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Acne Wisely Reducing unnecessary laboratory costs for isotretinoin Jason Meyer, MD, PhD Timothy Schmidt, MD, PhD Department of Dermatology Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Next Steps: Systematize reminders (by email, grand round announcements) to maintain cost reductions Extend the project to monitoring for other retinoids (acetretin, bexarotene) Dissemination: Literature review and educational lecture to reduce cost of monitoring for other medications Lessons learned: Literature review is important in evaluating the rationale for laboratory monitoringEducational interventions can be very effective in reducing laboratory costsReminders are important to maintain good practices Root causes and barriers to appropriate laboratory testing: Non-evidence based recommendations (e.g. package inserts) Uncertainty and lack of evidence, education on the topicHabit, custom or institutional teachingFear of litigation, defensive medicinePatient concerns Intervention: short lecture presentation with discussion Live presentations may have a greater impact on retention and behavior than other modalitiesComprehensive literature review performed to strengthen evidence basisMeetings and consultation with department faculty Supplementary Intervention: APEX dot phrase for progress notes Reminder of monitoring recommendations while saving time documenting Presented during lecture Alternative interventions considered: handout, email reminders, APEX tools 050100 AST 0204060 TG> 3 times (%)Testing at UCSF Dermatology (baseline) True North Pillar: Financial Strength (Lower our costs) WBCAST/ALTCholTG 051015202530354045 1234 $11,500 in unnecessary testing ($217/pt)Goal: Reduce unnecessary laboratory costs by 25%Routine acne patients No risk factors, normal baseline labs Recommended tests Baseline: Fasting lipid panel + ALT 1 or 2 months: Triglycerides + ALT Unnecessary testing (definition): Any testing beyond the aboveIsotretinoin lab abnormalities: typically mildLaboratory monitoring is expensive!

Written discharge instructions allow patients to understand what happened in the ED, the next steps that need to be taken for their health (follow up plan, medications, etc), and the concerning symptoms to prompt a return visit. 8% of UCSF ED patients report that English is not their primary language, yet at the beginning of our QI period, nearly all DCI were given in English. Studies show that DCIs written in patients' preferred language lead to better compliance and satisfaction. Figure 1. Breakdown of most common non- English primary languages spoken by UCSF ED patients Primary outcome: Increase the percentage of patients who receive language-specific discharge instructions by 30% among patients with non-English preference. Numerator= # visits by non-English preferring patients who receive DCI in their preferred language. Denominator = # visits by non- English preferring patients. Secondary outcome: Increase the understanding of DCI during callbacks for emergency department visits. Residents developed discharge instructions for the 6 most common ED chief complaints in Spanish, Chinese, and Russian (the three most common non- English languages in our patient population). DCI were vetted by the UCSF Patient Education Committee, then translated by certified UCSF Medical Translation Services DCI were imported into Apex as dotphrases for use by MDs, AHPs Performed mid year evaluations for barrier to use of DCI dotphrases and incorporated visual alerts on computers, email reminder Language Discharge instructions that used language specific DCITotal N of patients who list this as their primary languagePercentage of language specific DCI used Russian 2 55 3.6% Chinese 37 249 14.9% Spanish 5 572 1.9% Total 44 572 7.7%Breakdown of top language specific DCI used -chief complaint/language BACK -Russian 2 LACERATION SHORTNESS OF BREATH -Chinese 2 BACK PAIN -Chinese 3 ABDOMINAL PAIN -Spanish 5 CHEST PAIN -Chinese 5 HEADACHE -Chinese 5 ABDOMINAL PAIN -Chinese 8 Department visit -Chinese 12 Challenges: With unexpected upgrade of EPIC (UCSF Apex), we were unable to continue to track our data by searching for the use of the dotphrases beyond Q1. Some users were unaware that the dotphrases existed and others would have liked more chief complaints . Next Steps: Encourage residents to continue to use the discharge instructions and develop process in EPIC to track use. Possibilities to increase awareness: Embedding champion like charge nurses or senior residents who can audit and educate in real time. Consider using an EPIC notification that the patient might need language specific discharge information. Figure 2. Root cause analysis for barriers to patients receiving language specific DCI Figure 3. Sample DCI for chest pain, Chinese Table 2. Frequency of chief complaint DCIs utilized Table 1. Percentage of non- English speaking patients in Q1 that received language specific DCI Figure 4. Results of staff -wide Q1 survey on suggested steps to improvement and perceived barriers to language- specific DCI Dissemination:These DCIs will be accessible to all providers using UCSF Apex since these DCIs will be beneficial to other specialties, particularly primary care as there is significant overlap between the ED and primary care chief complaints.

Postoperative delirium can lead to a host of complications: Safety : Delirium leads to increased rates of falls, pneumonia, and mortality (1). Financial : Cognitive impairment and functional decline related to delirium can increase the overall cost per case, increasing utilization of resources such as rehabilitation and physical therapy. Systematic Growth : Complications related to delirium increase the overall length of hospital stay. UCSF nursing units have begun delirium screening. Surgery residents will need to learn how to interpret these tests and respond appropriately in the form of preventative nursing care orders and appropriate workup and management should delirium occur. General Surgery Pilot Data We generated our pilot data while the AWOL screening went into effect (2). We developed a delirium prevention orderset and accompanying resident education concurrent with hospital -wide implementation of the NuDESC (3) which is part of Mission Bay ERAS orderset . In pilot data from December 2016 -February 2017; 123 general surgery patients were screened for delirium, 23% had the prevention orderset and in only 14% of those patients was the orderset in place at the time of their hospital admission. 1.

UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Delirium Prevention in General Surgery Patients Jenny Kaplan and Steve Wisel Mentor: Ryutaro Hirose General Surgery Background Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned With development and implementation of the AWOL screening as a reliable predictor of delirium, our goal is to improve physician utilization of delirium prevention measures in at- risk patients Goal Target State: Surgical services to use delirium orderset in 75% of at risk patients (based on clinical suspicion or AWOL score) Delirium orderset to be used in a timely fashion so as to be preventative, within 3 hours of unit admission Next Steps: -Work with department to identify a report writer for general surgery -Embed delirium order in admission order set -Work with delirium team onsurgery specific AWOL score -Work with PACU and floor nurses around communication of positive screening scores Dissemination: Surgical teams can work together with nurses to streamline paging workflow and identify communication barriers. Creation of care pathways (i.e. colorectal ERAS) is the best way to improve compliance. Lessons Learned: Placing the onus on residents to remember to use an orderset when no reminder system is in place, and when the screening tool does not perform well in their target population, is difficult and was unsuccessful.

In the era of precision medicine, the rise in the cost of cancer care may have serious poten6al eects on the delivery of high-quality, pa6ent-centered care. Figure 1.

Among patients seen for GOC: 63.3% had goals documented anywhere in the chart by PCS (e.g., in the note or in the problem list). Only 54.5% had documentation of overall goals of care (e.g., curative, comfort-focused) and at least one specific treatment preference (e.g., code status, dialysis). Primary Outcome Among palliative care consultations \"Advance Care Planning/Goals of Care,\" who are discharged from UCSF Medical Center at Parnassus between September 1, 2017 and May 31, 2018, HPM fellows will increase the overall percentage of patients with documentation of GOC and treatment preferences, or an attempt to discuss these topics, in the palliative care consult note from 54% to 80%. Secondary Outcome Among palliative care consultations for \"Advance Care Planning/Goals of Care\" above, HPM fellows will increase the overall percentage of patients with dot phrase (.PCSACP) documentation of GOC and treatment preferences in the permanent problem list (\"Overview\").Next Steps:1.Improve orientation materials on the ACP dot phrase for residents and fellows rotating on PCS 2.Investigate ways to automatize the use of the ACP dot phrase 3.Incorporate overview of the ACP problem on problem list into ACP Navigator Dissemination:1.Submission to the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine national conference for presentation in Spring 2019 2.Collaborate with non- PCS services at UCSF the ACP dot phrase for improved standardization of GOC documentation Lessons Learned:1.MD- focused intervention undervalues work and documentation of PCS team members of other disciplines who lack access to problem listRoot Cause Analysis The team created a dot phrase (below) to encourage consistent, succinct, and time -saving documentation of GOC and at least one treatment preference The project and dot phrase were introduced at monthly palliative care meetings and through monthly emails to the division to encourage dot phrase useIntervention PCS providers document goals of care in varied locations without standardized of content Providers on non- PCS services do not have a standardized way to identify GOC in the EMR Intervention must not increase note - writing burden 78 Audit 67 Seen by PCS MD 48 Consult for GOC 48 GOC & at least 1 TP in A/P46 Overview with .PCSACPSecondary Outcome 95.8%*Primary Outcome 100%* * = goal met 40%60%80%100% September October November December January FebruaryMonthly Outcomes Primary Outcome Secondary Outcome Goal (80%)Key Results: Surpassed primary goal of > 80% documentation of GOC and 1+ treatment preference in each month Implementation of dot phrase to centralize and summarize GOC and treatment preferences increased overall GOC documentation ratesExample Month: February 2018 139Delirium is a syndrome that develops acutely & fluctuates, characterized by disturbed attention, awareness, and cognition. Delirium is a serious illness which impacts the experience and safety of our patients. It prolongs their length of stay and cost of hospitalization. In hospitalized patients, the AWOL and NuDESCtools are used by nurses to screen for delirium risk and active delirium, respectively. The delirium orderset(DO), a non- pharmacological delirium pathway, has been implemented at UCSF for patients with positive AWOL and NuDESCscores. This has led to decreased length of stay and improved outcomes. However, the DO has been under-utilized for patients on the hospital medicine teaching service.

Johnson, MD, Katie Raffel , MD, Bradley Monash, MD, Catherine Lau, MD, Stephanie Rogers, MD, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Next Steps:While placement of the DO is an important place to start, it would be interesting to better understand how effectively the individual elements of the DO are being executed for patients with the DO on hospital units. Dissemination: The delirium work done by internal medicine residents is also being implemented in the general surgery and urology departments. The delirium working group has broadened efforts to nearly all of the floors of the UCSF Moffitt-Long Hospital. Our work could be included in a how -to guide for other institutions looking to tackle delirium in a similar way. Lessons Learned: Tackling delirium reduction is a multidisciplinary effort requiring buy -in from the front -line providers - physicians, nurses, patient care associates, physical and occupational therapists, alike. DO placement is merely one component, but we need to engage all providers to help execute the plan for at -risk or delirious patients to create meaningful improvements.

This creates apoor patient experience .Often, the mother isstill recovering from surgery, and the father is overwhelmed with caring forboth his wife and child, sothey cannot adequately retain spoken information provided bythe ICN staff.This problem has thegreatest effect on the first day of an infant's hospitalization, before the parents have hadthechance tovisittheICN, orattend rounds . Increase thepercentage about thebaby's medical condition atbirth for3outofthelast 11months (see graph below) .Next Steps: We are going to continue giving out written communication, in the same form as the half sheet shown above, for any infant admitted to the ICN at time of delivery. Dissemination: Written communication could be given to parents of children in the hospital for treatment plans, discharge requirements, or other complicated medical information.

Without close monitoring, neurosurgical drains may be left in place for longer than necessary. This may in fact pose harm to the patient as drains are foreign objects associated with increased infection risk, prolonged length of stay in higher level -of-care nursing units, and decreased patient comfort and mobility. Together, these factors impact quality and safety, as well as patient experience. At the outset of this project, there were no standards for assessing and then documenting 1) length of drain application (i.e. duration of ongoing drain use) and 2) daily requirement/indication for continued drainage. Our goal was to determine and improve upon the rate of drain documentation in resident progress notes. This included:1)The presence of drains (including number of drains and drain output)2) The indication/requirement for ongoing drainage Next Steps:We will continue to assess drain documentation compliance and standardize the use of the Apex Patient List 'drain' column. In an effort to reduce unnecessary drain use, we will begin to quantify length of drain application for different surgical procedures, and attempt to develop standards for length of drain application. Dissemination: Our intervention, the Apex Patient List drain column, can be adapted and incorporated into Patient Lists used by other services. Lessons Learned: Prior to our intervention, drain documentation compliance was relatively high. While our efforts appear to have improved compliance, our experience indicates the importance of the Gap Analysis.Providers manage a multitude of postoperative treatment factors, of which drain management if an essential component. Without a simple method for identifying patients undergoing drainage, nor a trigger/prompt for documenting drainage, providers may not reliably assess and document drain presence/indication for drainage . In part, these problems exist because we lacked a charting method that allows providers to easily and remotely identify which patients are undergoing drainage. Additionally, we lack a method for prompting providers to document drainage on a daily basis. We hypothesized that by increasing daily drain documentation and developing a drain-identifier within the electronic medical record, we would improve the reliability of drain assessment by care providers, and thereby achieve a secondary reduction of unnecessarily prolonged drain use. Our interventions included 1) modification of the Apex Patient List to include a column that denotes presence of a drain, which allows care providers to quickly and remotely identify which patients are undergoing drainage, and, 2) frequent verbal reinforcement and assessment of drain documentation compliance within the neurosurgical service. 8486889092949698100% ComplianceDrain Documentation ComplianceNeuro Drain Column: Identifies patients with drains as well as drain duration Part of daily rounding list to help quickly identify patients with a drain Implemented Oct 2017 with drain documentation compliance quantified starting July 2017 until present Drain Documentation Compliance: Compliance appeared to increase steadily over sequential quarters Compliance also noted to be higher after implementation of the Apex Drain Column 80859095100 Q1 Q2 Q3Drain Documentation Compliance 142UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium POLST: Quality Improvement Initiative to Enhance Advance Care Planning and Transitions in Care Jeremy A.

It is important to ensure that patients with serious ophthalmic conditions that can be vision-threatening are not lost -to-follow - up. Between 3/1/17-3/28/17, 33 inpatient ophthalmology consults were seen at Moffitt -Long Hospitals. Of the 16 patients whom we recommended outpatient follow - up and who did not have an existing non-UCSF eye provider, 5 (31%) had scheduled appointments listed for ophthalmology clinic as of 4/7/17. Of those 5 patients, 2 (33%) patients no-showed and were rescheduled, and 1 patient had follow -up scheduled in the near future (after review date of 4/7/17). While these numbers are only representative of one month, it appears that there is room for improvement in terms of scheduling follow -up and increasing outpatient follow -up adherence. Residents will increase the outpatient follow -up adherence from 33% to 50% for 3-out-of- 4 quarters for Moffitt-Long inpatients who were seen as ophthalmology consults and had recommended outpatient follow - up scheduled in ophthalmology clinic. Next Steps: Better utilization of the Epic report to send patient reminders about appointments Trying to reduce the extra step of sending Epic messages to scheduling staff to schedule follow -up Dissemination:Creating a smartphrase for follow -up that autopopulates into a report that can be tracked can be utilized by many consult services. Lessons Learned: Tracking patient follow -up is the first step to improving adherence We reviewed and updated our consult note template with clearer instructions regarding recommended outpatient follow -up with pull -down menus. These changes were incorporated into a public smartphrase called . ophthofollowup (see below) that we incorporated into all of our consult notes on 7/28/17. 1) 2) 3)Factors that may contribute to low outpatient follow -up include difficulty scheduling appointments, insurance coverage issues and patient no-show. Barriers to scheduling a follow -up appointment include lack of communication between the primary team and ophthalmology consult resident, and/or between the ophthalmology consult resident and the ophthalmology scheduling staff. In patients who no-show for their appointment, this may be due to lack of reminders, difficulty with transportation or other unidentified reasons. 4) The patients who elected to follow -up at UCSF autopopulated an Epic report (Ophthalmology QI REP0066557) that could be accessed by our support staff to help schedule appointments. Residents also sent Epic messages to our scheduling staff about follow -up appointments. This QI report that we created and fine-tuned with the help of the EHR Reporting team also allowed us to better track patient follow -up. It provided information regarding: -Next ophthalmology/optometry clinic visit date -Type of ophthalmology/optometry clinic -Visit status (scheduled, completed, no showed, cancelled) Quarter (8/2017- 2 (10/2017- 1/2018)Quarter 3 seen 47 126 87 No.of scheduled outpatient appointments at UCSF ophthalmology33 76 62 No. appts that occurred* 32 64 60 No. of completed appts * 27 (84%) 48 (75%) 37 * 0 (0%) 4 (6%) 4 (6%) *Of all the appointments that occurred at the time the report was run at the end of each quarter Met goal of >50% outpatient follow -up adherence for 3 out of 4 quarters! 144UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Reducing Discharge Opioid Prescriptions after Orthopaedic Surgery Trevor Grace, MD ; Patrick Curran, MD; Bobby Tay, MD; Mohammad Diab , MD; Erik Hansen, MD UCSF Department of Orthopaedic Surgery Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned The U.S. is currently in an opioid epidemic, which has been a focus of recent legislation and media attention Unfortunately, opioids prescribed after surgery are common sources for misuse and diversion, and may be a significant contributor to the opioid crisis Musculoskeletal is known to be more painful than other procedures, and Orthopaedic Surgeons thus hold an important responsibility to curb excessive opioid prescriptions The goal of this QI initiative is to promote judicious and standardized prescribing practices by reducing the number of opioids prescribed by our department Specifically, we sought to decrease the median discharge opioid prescription by 10% compared to the 2016- 2017 academic year Next Steps: Analyze post -discharge data including refill rates within 0 and 30 days after surgery to gauge the effect of reduced opioid prescriptionsImplement an order set to further standardize discharge prescription regimens in each subspecialtyContinue quantification and monitoring of discharge opioid prescriptions as means to promote judicious prescription practices Dissemination: Periodic notifications of discharge prescription quantities could be provided to each department or even each provider to promote transparencyThe Electronic Medical Record (EMR) could automate discharge prescription quantities and notify providers if they exceed recommended regimens Lessons Learned: The most valuable lesson we learned from this project is the importance of teamwork and collaboration in working toward a collective goal. We had multiple meetings to openly discuss strategies, ideas, and directions to take in order for us to achiev e our target. These discussions were invaluable in the success of our Quality Improvement project this year.We observed a substantial decrease in the median discharge opioid prescription across the entire orthopaedic department in the 2017 -2018 academic year, as compared to the 2016 - 2017 academic year (Fig 3) This decrease was observed in each Orthopaedic subspecialty (Fig 4)We performed continuous quantification and monitoring of discharge opioid prescriptions provided to Orthopaedic inpatients being discharged by Orthopaedic Residents, Nurse Practitioners, or Physician's Assistants at UCSF After each rotation, summary graphs (Figs 1-2) would be emailed to the entire Orthopaedic department detailing the median discharge opioid prescription provided for that rotation, and comparing it to the prior year's median and the goal Encouraging tips, techniques, and reminders were included with each email to promote judicious prescription practices 14521.6 18.417.61615.2 8 3.2 0510152025 Medical Issue NOSMeds NOSConcerning symptonsHome supplies Bounce BackPercent of callsIssues Reported to Clinic within 30 days of Discharge UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Head and Neck Surgery Complex Discharge Coordination Sean Alemi , RN, MSN, OCN Otolaryngology -Head and Neck Surgery Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned UCSF as an institution aims to achieve zero harm and continually improve patient care. Head and Neck Cancer patient discharges after free-flap surgery are complex, requiring coordination of equipment and home health services, as well as patient understanding and support. However, there are concerns about patient safety at discharge: patients call after discharge with many issues, including confusion about wound care and lack of appropriate supplies, and can have subsequent ED visits or readmissions. OHNS service readmitted 11.96% of its patients within 30 days of discharge from July 2016 -March 2017 (ReDash). The average length of stay for the H&N service is 6.41 days for YTD as of Jan 2017 ( Svcline dash), with 7 medically unnecessary days of inpatient care per week due to discharge delays (1 wk resident tracking). Outpatient clinic RN receives 20.8 post- operative issues/day (1 wkRN tracking). 47.2% of issues are a result of medication issues, general questions, home supplies, and unplanned medical care. From July 1 2017 -June 30 2018: oReduce number of post by outpatient RN by 20% oReduce readmissions rate to be no more than 11.6% to align with UCSF target. oMaintain or reduce current average length of stay and medically unnecessary inpatient days oProcess measure: 80% compliance with interventionNext Steps: -Assess utility and ease of use from perspective of care team (attendings, residents, PT, OT, SLP , case management), and modify as needed-Incorporate information contained in note into standardized pathway currently being developed -Assess outpatient tracking of calls to identify areas of continued care breakdown and consider additional interventions to improve understanding and careDissemination:Incorporation of a system of documentation for early coordination of care during admission could be performed by other services, with modification of checklist to address individual service needsLessons Learned: Improvement is best implemented with involvement of multiple people rather than reliance on a single individual to achieve a task; Communication continues to be an area of improvement that can significantly impact patient care.Our gap analysis revealed the following areas as potential contributors to our current state: Medication Issues: conflict between national initiative to reduce pain meds and patient need; unknown pain med requirements; drug not a covered benefit and requires further authorization; patients do not leave hospital with medications in hand General Questions: different hospitalization experiences for every patient; different needs with different discharge instructions; patients don't know what is normal after discharge; information is too much and nonstandard = patient confusion, forgetful, not relevant at time Home supplies: patients don't have DME they need upon discharge; insurance doesn't cover DME; no access to supplies they need in their community Bounce back: unanticipated medical problems; inability to tolerate PO; poor pain control; lack of understanding of normal post -op course; lack of supplies in their community/outpatient After discussion with residents, attendings , and the UBLT, the planned intervention entailed: Standardized communication tool in the form of a \"Plan of Care\" note placed by primary team on transfer from ICU to floor (usually POD2) for all Mission Bay free flap patients. Includes checklist of the following information: The goal is to improve communication such that all team members have an understanding and early awareness of the discharge plan; provide consistent patient and family teaching throughout admission; and enable outpatient team to reference the anticipated plan after discharge.

In addition, these suits are not gender - sensitive or culturally sensitive. -We aim to reduce spending on protective garments for family members by 10% cumulatively over FY17. -As pediatric anesthesia practice has changed, more and more parents are invited back into the operating room with their child and therefore must wear appropriate covering for the sterile environment. -Although the number of bunny suits used per year has increased dramatically over the past 5 years, the cost impact of this change has not been analyzed. Next Steps: -Develop new proposal for gowns given OR nursing concerns regarding inadequate posterior coverage of smocks. -Discuss roll-out of newly proposed gowns with OR nursing staff to ensure agreement. -Roll out newly proposed gown with emails and flyers in the preoperative areas. Dissemination:-This improvement is unique to pediatric anesthesiology where parental presence on induction of anesthesia is desired. Lessons Learned: -We learned the importance of getting \"buy- in\" from OR nursing staff at the ground level for the proposed changes, despite having received approval from the OR nursing staff leadership.1.Average baseline bunny suit usage (determined over two week period in Oct 2017): 11 gowns/day. Annual cost of bunny suits = $4,496 (11 gowns/day x $1.12/gown x 365 days). 2.Survey sent nation- wide to 21major pediatric surgical centers, with 11 responses -Most centers that utilize parental presence induction utilized bunny suits. 3.Selected \"blue smock\" protective gown fluid- resistant, height/weight, dresses/skirts). Cost efficient at $0.55/gown. 4.Approved by perioperative OR nursing committee with formal roll out starting 4/2/2018 with emails to perioperative nursing staff and anesthesia providers. 5.Post-roll out blue smock usage at 6 gowns/day and bunny suits at 5 gowns/day, likely due to inadequate dissemination of roll -out information and concerns raised from intraoperative OR nursing regarding inadequate posterior coverage of blue smocks. See Figure 1 for projected cost savings (28% annual savings).1.Determine baseline levels of bunny suit usage over a two week period in September 2017, extrapolating this data to approximate number of suits used annually, and annual cost. 2.Survey other major pediatric surgical centers who regularly invite parents into their ORs for the induction of anesthesia to determine what alternatives to the bunny suits exist. 3.Compare pricing for different options, and propose a new garment that is satisfactory and cost effective to the pediatric OR committee for evaluation and approval prior to implementation. 4.Purchase and roll out cost effective parental presence induction gowns. 5.Determine post -intervention parental presence induction gown usage over a two week period and extrapolate cost savings. \"Bunny and Blue Smock*Figure 1.

Risk factors include small patient size, large sheath size, history ofrepeated femoral access and duration of cardiac catheterization . Patients with single ventricle physiology who require multiple cardiac catheterizations and surgeries are particularly atrisk for development ofocclusions. Furthermore, Ifthey develop occlusions, they may be subjected toriskier future procedures, such asjugular venous access ortranshepatic access.

Because sedation is now commonly administered by non -anesthesiologists and not in the OR, the Joint Commission (JCAHO) has set forth a procedural sedation checklist that should be complied with prior to, during, and after all procedural sedation administrations. Sedation documentation does not occur reliably in the PICU but is a required element of procedural sedation in order to comply with quality & safety standards set forth by the Joint Commission (JCAHO). The UCSF sedation committee conducts audits on the following components monthly to ensure compliance: 1.H&P/Interval history on record 2.NPO classification completed 8.Discharge criteria met Out of 54 procedural sedation logs initiated in the Pediatric ICU in 2016- 2017 CY , only 3 (5.5%) logs were complete and adherent to JCAHO regulations. We aim to increase total procedural sedation log completion from 5.5% to 75% completion in the PICU 2017 -2018 CY.A secondary goal will be to increase documentation of pre - procedural MD/NP assessment from 52% to 90%. Next Steps: 1)Continued education on the importance and appropriate usage of the sedation navigator 2)Cooperative work with theestablished UCSF Sedation committee 3)Continued assessment and analysis on success of completion of the navigator 4)Implementation of'sedation navigator checklis t' aspart oftheroutine of what qualifies as procedural sedation as part of orientation to employees in affected hospital areas 2)Inclusion ofprocedural sedation navigator training modules in routine EPIC training that occurs for new employeesWebegan initially conducting apre-assessment toexamine thebarriers related topoor documentation inthe Pediatric ICU. Providers & RNs were asked to complete a short quiz assessing the use of the sedation navigator, as well as the appropriate patient population for the navigator. We found a general lack of education about standard use of the navigator and the qualified patient population. To improve this process, we prepared two educational presentations : one aimed towards the MD/NP patient providers, explaining the standards expected, how this will improve patient care, and education on how to complete the sedation log. The second presentation was aimed towards the patient RN, who plays a large role in completion and can be a significant patient advocate for completing Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Improving Early Discharge from the Pediatric Acute Care Floor David Chen, MD MPH*, Matthew Nordstrom, MD* Faculty Sponsors: Glenn Rosenbluth , MD, Bekmezian, Fiore, MD Department of Pediatrics *Indicates co -authorship Background Plan and Intervention Project Goals Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned -Discharge before noon (DBN) rates are an increasingly used hospital metric -DBN can improve throughput of patients from high- cost/resource areas such as the ED and ICU to the floor via the following, though the effects are controversial1: -Decreased ratio of expected to actual LOS and reduced readmission rate 2. -Move median time of emergency department admissions and transfers from 5pm to 4pm 3. -In recent years, numerous changes have been implemented such as a daily \"Tee Time\" meeting for discharge planning and incentives for each patient discharged before noon. -Residents are crucial to the discharge process, including writing the discharge order itself, yet prior initiatives have only had limited resident involvement in planning and design -At the time of project development, C5 Med Surg unit at Benioff Children's Hospital was meeting the DBN unit goal of 20% for 6 out of the prior 10 months. -In this context, we decided to develop our QI project as an initiative to improve DBN, focusing on areas residents have control -We aimed to improve on the prior year's discharge before noon rate. At the time of project development, the DBN rate from last year was 20.9%. -In consultation with pediatric faculty, we decided that aiming for an approximate 15% relative increase was a target that was substantial and achievable. Thus, our formal QI project goal was: \"The percentage of patients discharged before noon from the pediatric hospital medicine (purple, orange, and green services) will exceed 24% from July 1 st, 2017 to June 30th, 2018 at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital\"-DBN rates were lower at the beginning of the year, potentially due to new interns and senior residents -Barriers to DBN were assessed with on service residents on a month to month basis: -Many residents identified primary barriers as ones perceived to be out of their control: meds- to- beds/pharmacy, subspecialist discretion, nursing, and transportation. -Residents provided feedback that pre-rounding and other morning activities made it frequently difficult to assess patients for discharge readiness in the morning -Above feedback led to the early discharge order initiative outlined above -Average discharge rates appeared to increase following the roll -out of the discharge order before 8 AM initiative (red arrow), from 23.0% prior to 26.1% after -As of April 30th, we are above our goal of 24%, with our current YTD DBN rate at 24.3%-We developed \"Early Discharge Best Practices\" (see right panel) and disseminated them to all residents, with routine reminders at each rotation change. These items were focused on those items with resident control. -At the beginning of January, we implemented a discharge orders in before 8 AM initiative, incorporating the day and night shift teams. The day team would relay anticipated discharges and the night team would prepare them for discharge. If the night team indicated in the morning that the patient met discharge criteria, a conditional discharge order would be written prior to 8 AM and the attending notified -Regular updates were emailed out to residents on the acute MonthPediatrics QI Project Results Best Practices for Discharge Planning As discharge approaches (2-3 days before): (1) Discuss discharge planning on rounds and at Tee Time (R3) (2) Discuss follow -up plans with consultants and communicate with Case Management (R1 & R3) (3) Set expectations with families about the discharge time (i.e. in the morning if possible) (R1 & R3) Day before discharge: (4) Pharmacy -settle discharge prescriptions if possible (R3) (5) Check with consultants if they need to see the patient prior to discharge (R1)(6) Finalize f/u needs with subspecialists and inform Case Management (R1 & R3)(7) Complete DC instructions (R1) Once you know if the patient can be discharged before noon, make sure R1/R3/Attending are all aware. Next Steps: -The main next steps for this project will be maintaining the interventions for future year as well as joining efforts between nursing, pharmacy, case management, and physicians for discharge planning-Analysis of balancing measures, such as length of stay, to evaluate for unintended effects Dissemination:None of the practices used in our project were specific to pediatrics and could be adopted to other inpatient acute care floors. Inter-specialty forums such as GME symposia or chief resident meetings could be used to disseminate best practices across the hospital Lessons Learned: -Support for a project from multiple levels is crucial - alignment of this goal with pre-existing goals for faculty, nursing, and other staff 1.Shine, D.

Questionnaires such asthePatient Health Quesitonnaire- 9 (PHQ -9) provide a quantified depressive symptoms, which can beused forscreening aswell astracking symptom change over time.These questionnaires are brief, easily administered, and can be completed electronically . Moreover, insurance companies are increasingly requiring objective measures ofpatient improvement inorder toreimburse for services. InJune of2015, Institute transitioned toanelectronic medical record system, APeX. This created an opportunity toelectronically send out questionnaires through MyChart ,anonline patient portal, and store theresults inthe patient's medical record .The adult outpatient psychiatry clinics atUCSF are currently automatically sending PHQ -9'sto almost allpatients electronically through MyChart .However, completion rates these questionnaires arelow. This isaproblem because: 1.Itbecomes difficult totrack how over time 2.Insurance companies may notreimburse forvisits without more objective data on patient improvement 3.Providers are less accountable forthe care they provide 4.Patients arenotactively participating in their care The PHQ- 9completion rates from April 1, 2016 encountersNext Steps: Continue building PHQ -9 into default clinic flow, e.g. tablet computer available in waiting area Hire staff such as medical assistants to complete screening questionnaires directly with patients and enter data into APeX Direct messaging to clinicians with low completion rates Dissemination:Reinforce front desk work flow incorporating distribution of unanswered questionnaires.

Project Goals: To improve communication b/w outpatient pulmonologists & inpatient pulmonary consult team by implementing adischarge template that summarizes the hospitalization and clearly specifies the time-frame needed and prerequisites before follow -up. Aim Statement: Pulmonary/Critical Care fellows rotating on the UCSF Pulmonary Consult service in the year 2017-2018 will reach a goal rate of 75% discharge template completion. How to Measure Success: We tracked discharge template completion on the inpatient Pulmonary consult service.

Undertreated pain results in adverse clinical outcomes, undue suffering, decreased quality of life, and threatens the UCSF true north pillars of patient experience, quality and safety. Furthermore, there are significant disparities in pain management as racial/ethnic minorities and underserved populations are at higher risk for undertreated cancer- related pain. A recent intradepartmental analysis discovered frequent inadequate pain assessments in patients evaluated for palliative radiation for bone metastases. While 90% of patients had a documented pain scale (1- 10/10), only 50% had other components of pain assessed (i.e. location, quality, aggravating factor, alleviating factors, interference with activity). Of those with documented pain (on 1- 10 scale) median score was 5, and 51% had scores >4. Among these symptomatic patients, analgesic regimen was assessed in 28%, and a pain intervention was documented in just 17%. The goal was to achieve documentation of a \"plan of care for pain\" in >50%of new patient consultations seen by residents for bone metastases in the department of Radiation Oncology for 3 out of 4 best performing quarters in the 2017- 2018 academic year. Satisfactory plan of care will include appropriate pain intervention, such as adjustment in analgesic regimen, referral to SMS/palliative care, communication with primary oncologist/PMD, and radiation therapy. Next Steps:Our next steps will be to collect data for the 4 thquarter, as well as report our outcomes to the department QI leads. Pending our outcomes, this could be implemented throughout the department in accordance with Merit -based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) quality objectives. Dissemination: This simple \"plan of care for pain\" could readily be adapted throughout the cancer center. Lessons Learned: There were unexpected challenges in designing and implementing this project. We had initially wanted a drop down smart phrase, but due to limitations with EPIC programmers, we instead utilized a wild card (***) format. We also discovered that email reminders can be easily overlooked, leading to our third quarter decline in compliance. We will utilize in person reminders at our morning conferences to ensure compliance in the 4 thquarter. We have achieved our goal of documenting a plan of care for pain in >50% of patients seen in consultation for bone metastases in 2 of 3 quarters thus far, with 4 thquarter data pending. In particular, we found that the analgesic regimen was assessed or modified in 35% of consultations, urgent radiation therapy undertaken in 26%, communication with primary provider or oncologist in 10%, and referral to the Palliative Care service in just 4%. Current practice documenting pain intervention in Radiation Oncology is dependent on physician preference. In a previous departmental analysis, we found that we were documenting pain in patients seen in consultation for bone metastases, but we were not explicitly addressing this pain in our assessments and plans. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have identified documentation of a 'plan of care for pain\" as an important quality measure in Radiation Oncology, which will be assessed in the Merit- based Incentive Payment System. In this intervention, we focused specifically on patients seen in consultation for bone metastases. Many patients with bone metastases have pain and radiation therapy is often an important palliative treatment modality. We created a smart phrase in the electronic medical record, to be populated into consult note templates. The phrase is \"I have assessed the patient's pain today, which is ***/10. The plan of care for pain is *** .\" Email reminders were sent to physicians 2 times per quarter. Charts were subsequently audited on a quarterly basis, and percent compliance was recorded per quarter. 153UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2018 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium STANDARDIZED DOCUMENTATION OF ADVERSE CONTRAST EVENTS (ACE) Molly Chapman, MD, MA K. Pallav Kolli, MD Christopher Hess, MD, PhD Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging Background Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Adverse contrast events (ACEs) inCTexaminations requiring intravenous (IV) contrast administration are animportant cause ofmorbidity and even mortality inradiology .Severe allergic reactions and extravasation are uncommon with modern iodinated contrast media, but occur with relatively high frequency when accounting forthelarge volume ofCT studies obtained incurrent medical practice .When ACEs occur, itisimportant that they becarefully documented in the electronic health record (EHR), both toeffectively communicate events with ordering providers sothat they can monitor for late complications and toavoid future events when patients undergo repeat imaging .

Eleni Greenwood M.D., M.D. Kaitlyn Wald M.D. Heather Huddleston M.D. Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation prior tooocyte retrieval donot consistently obtain apreoperative history and physical (H&P) atthebeginning oftheir cycle . This isanissue because when completed at thelast visit prior tooocyte retrieval, thevisit may take twice aslong delaying the patient and those that follow her.Further, ifapatient has amedical condition that may alter anesthesia plans during retrieval, there is limited time toadjust plans .Improving the timeliness and completeness ofpreoperative history and physical seeks toaddress theUCSF true north pillars ofQuality and Safety and the Patient Experience . Each cycle start involves abaseline ultrasound, preoperative H&P and confirmation that patients have fortheir cycle . Inasample offour weeks from the2016-2017 the amongst patients who went toretrieval was 17% . The objective ofthis Quality improvement project was toreduce the incidence of upto30minutes per flow fornursing staff who areleftwith theresponsibility ofensuring thecompleteness ofthis todecrease therate ofincomplete H&Ps by 50% .Inasuccessful endeavor, the rate should beless than 8.5% per quarter foratleast three quarters inthe 2017\u2014 2018 academic year.Next Steps: We had an increase in the rate of incomplete H&Ps in Q3. We are currently analyzing the potential causes -the leading cause is double booking H&P patients. Furthermore, on an annual basis at the start of each academic year we will remind staff about the importance of completing H&Ps Dissemination: Encouraging development of plans with multiple stake holders, in our case, nurses, physicians and the medical assistant director, helped to implement a plan in which everyone was invested. Also, simple reminder emails proved to be useful. Lessons Learned: During this process, we were notified that for patients pursing fertility preservation, a consultation performed within 30 days of the oocyte retrieval qualifies as a history and physical. Nursing staff were notified. There was a decrease in the incomplete H&P rate in quarters 1 -3 after an intervention of educating clinicians and staff about the importance of completing H&Ps. The mean incomplete H&P rate in quarters 1 -3 was 5.4%. The mean incomplete H&P rate constitutes a 68.4% decrease in the incomplete H&P rate.Hypothesis: increased awareness about the rate of missed H&Ps amongst the staff that preform H&Ps would improve the completion rate. Intervention : In quarter 1, we notified the primary providers that complete H&Ps for patients including clinical fellows, nurse practitioner and physicians. Interventions were determined on a quarterly basis after reviewing trends in missed H&Ps. Though we saw an improvement in quarter 1, there was a trend towards fertility preservation patients representing a disproportionate amount of incomplete H&Ps. We proposed that focusing on the patients in the fertility preservation program would be helpful. These patients may start their treatment shortly after consultation may not have had time to receive a proper H&P . 155Next Steps: We will continue this intervention to decrease delirium in our patient population. With improved implementation and dissemination of protocols, we are confident we will provide a benefit to our patients. Our overall numbers of patients diagnosed with delirium are quite small, thus we will continue to accumulate data and calculate the impact of this project in our patient population. Dissemination: This hospital- wide initiative can be adapted by other services by incorporating delirium assessment tools in their daily practice, using the coded lists and appropriately applying the orderset. Lessons Learned: We learned that implementing a multidisciplinary project is challenging, as there are many competing priorities in delivering excellent patient care and new tasks are difficult to adopt in a timely manner. Delirium is serious and affects 30-60% of hospitalized patients. Delirium results in increased mortality, increased length of stay, increased falls, and increased cognitive deterioration in patients with dementia. Delirium is under -recognized, with 50-70% cases missed and up to 30% of hospital acquired delirium can be prevented. Reducing hospital delirium is important to providing quality patient care. Our overarching goal is to reduce hospital delirium using am evidence-based, nonpharmacologic method of early detection and prevention. Our measurable goal was whether a delirium prevention orderset was placed at any time during the hospitalization for patients who had a positive AWOL or NuDESC screening, with target 50% resident compliance in ordering the delirium order set, cumulative Jan 1 -June 30, 2018.

Dissemination:Could this be used at Mission bay in a pediatric setting? Could this be used by outpatient providers? Lessons Learned: Cooperation with a skilled, invested WOCN is invaluable. Electronic and Telephone consultation with a knowledgeable wound care RN and/or MD is highly sought- after. The pace of progress exceeds the pace of EHR modifications.Quarterly evaluation and results, AY2017 -2018: Goal: 75% of nonsurgical wound consults triaged and preliminary recommendations documented in chart using wounds workflow within 24 hours (based on APEX Qualitative Assessment: Success! Because of the ongoing QI initiative, we have been extremely diligent and well- informed and thus proactive about seeing and staffing wound consults, whether operative or nonoperative.We have collaborated with Bobby Robertson, RN who was recently hired as the WOCN at Parnassus. He works 5 days a week and brings vast experience working in conjunction with plastic surgeons. His knowledge and efficiency in seeing wound consults has already reduced the burden of consults significantly and for many patients we have been able to discuss a multidisciplinary plan. We have coordinated our services so we are aware of staffing shortages and scheduled absences and are prepared to fill in when these occur. Due to publicity and awareness at all levels -housestaff/trainees and surgical attending, the plastic surgery team proactively took steps to address nonsurgical wound consults in a timely fashion. Also -improved communication with the parnassus WOCN improved screening and has improved the quality of referrals to plastic surgery. We are seeing more operative consults! The wound care clinical nurse specialist (CNS) team currently serves as the gateway for triage of inpatient wounds. Most of these wounds have potential to heal with dressings alone. Not infrequently, UCSF inpatients have wounds that require procedures beyond the scope of the wound CNS team, such as sharp debridement or reconstruction. The Division of Plastic and Reconstructive surgery inpatient consult service currently works alongside the wound CNS team to provide bedside or surgical debridement for wounds initially seen by the wound CNS team. However, until now, the traditional workflow for referring a chronic wound to the inpatient Plastic Surgery consult service requires multiple steps involving additional providers. This can result in delays in seeing patients and therefore scheduling procedures, task duplication, and occasional confusion regarding the specific consultant roles. Additionally, when the wound CNS team is temporarily unavailable; assessment can be delayed. In these urgent circumstances our inpatient consult service can also provide wound care recommendations, but this service is rarely utilized. Restructuring the integration and workflow for plastic surgery in evaluating inpatient chronic wounds will offer the following True North benefits:Lowering Cost: Wound care is labor and resource intensive for inpatients, timely referral and appropriate treatment could reduce time to healing. Improving communication and standardizing documentation could improve efficiency and further reduce costs.Learning Health System: Most primary inpatient medical providers do not have formal training in wound assessment and their energies are focused on acute medical illness rather than chronic wounds; Implementation of a decision making tool and standardized workflow as part of this QI initiative could improve communication and efficiency Strategic Growth: An increase in billable procedural wound care, especially sharp or surgical debridement, could increase reimbursement for the medical center and faculty practices. Existing Workflow: The current workflow for plastic surgery to become involved in chronic wound consults introduces delay, potential errors in communication, and is highly dependent on the availability of the wound CNS. 1. Improve two -way dialogue between wound CNS and plastic surgery team and plastic surgery team responsiveness, as measured by plastic surgery inpatient team completion of APEX wound workflow checklist and action plan within 72 hours of wound CNS recommendation for plastic surgery evaluation at 75% compliance; 3 out of 4 quarters for next academic year. 2. Increase identification of appropriate surgical candidates and direct consultation from primary admitting team.3. Increase plastic surgery consultation for wound evaluation when wound CNS team is unavailable. Implement APEX checklist for inpatient wound consults - with assessment, action plan, and followup plan. Checklist will track specific time points and outcomes and will be filled out by plastic surgery inpatient team. Develop educational and interactive wound assessment aid with decision tree logic and pictures to guide primary providers. Recom mendations for consult and pre- consult data to gather provided in checklist form. Will not require provider to expend time to review slides/modules with lar gely irrelevant data, and saves time with unnecessary pages to multiple consultants. Available even when wound care RN is off duty or unavailable. Integrated feedback system, allowing for suggestions and referring provider satisfaction to be tracked. Provide standards for wound documentation and APEX -linked wound photography using smartphones running Haiku. Improves communicat ion between providers and fidelity of clinical documentation. Increases efficiency, avoids unnecessary dressing changes causing patient discomfort and allows consultants and team members to confer using similar information.
