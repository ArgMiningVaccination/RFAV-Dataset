It's very, very uplifting. Astounding. More than I thought it could be. It's a total lifestyle laid down in the sutras (medical scriptures).S. Morgan, Aptos, CA [TESTIMONIALS] I received so much here, far more than I expected and feel so grateful. I'm planning to return next year, too. Fullness remains ever full!L. Robertson, Pittsburg, CA [TESTIMONIALS] This program is for those who feel ready to take the time to go more deeply within for Ayurvedic learning, rejuvenation, strengthening and cleansing. This unique program has come together to support western participants in an eastern context, learning by living, studying, self-healing and meditating in a traditional setting. The programs take place at the Vaidyagrama Ayurveda Healing Village, Coimbatore, India, and each participant will be assigned a unique program according to local physician assessment. Individualized Panchakarma programs are intended to bring both physical and spiritual benefits of cleansing and rejuvenation. Though your journey is individual, the group presence is planned as a powerful silent witness and support. Jaisri will consult with each participant prior to departure, to help plan the best outcomes for each individual and for the group. During the program Jaisri will be present as a group participant and facilitator, and may also lead discussions about Ayurveda and Panchakarma. In addition to the classical healing programs, we are pleased to offer the optional opportunity for you to also attend the 5th International Conference on Ayurveda and Pre-Conference Workshops, taking place at Vaidyagrama in advance of your Panchakarma program. World renowned presenters include Dr. Vasant Lad, Mother Maya (Maya Tiwari), Dr. Robert Svoboda, Dr. Gopala Krishnan, Dr. Claudia Welch, Myra Lewin and more! Program Options: Please let us know if you would like to register for the International Conference on Ayurveda and we can assist with your reservations and payment if you like (see Details page for price and further information). All programs will take place at the Vaidyagrama Ayurveda Healing Village, Coimbatore, India. Vaidyagrama literally means \"healing village\" and the village at Coimbatore, led by Dr. Ramkumar, includes a community of Ayurveda hospitals and physicians in a natural setting that is designed for optimum healing. Vaidyagrama is environmentally friendly, and perfectly balances contemporary building practices with classical Ayurveda principles. The belief at Vaidyagrama is that the greater the harmony with nature the richer the health and wellness created. As Dr. Ramkumar explains, Vaidyagrama was born of the desire to live simple, live well, live healthy and live happy. According to Ayurveda wellness includes physical wellbeing, mental and emotional wellbeing, spiritual wellbeing, social wellbeing, and environmental wellbeing. When all these aspects come together they create a state of optimum good health. Staying at Vaidyagrama allows us to start or continue our healing journey on all levels of wellness, and treatments at the centre are fully personalized, taking into account the demands of life on our return home. The centre offers a full range of Ayurveda treatments including the popular Panchakarma. Dr. Ramkumar tells us that Ayurveda is a way of life that deals not only with the body and mind but also with the human spirit and consciousness. It is the knowledge of life and longevity and promotes balance within the body for optimum health and wellbeing. When the body is out of balance on any level toxins cannot be properly removed and therefore build up creating disease and discomfort. Ayurveda teaches us to understand how disease can enter our bodies and then how to restore balance and \"ease\". We must first try to nourish our bodies in order for them to function well again and eliminate toxins that have built up. We can also remove the built-up toxic waste within us through a process of detoxification (Panchakarma). When all efforts are made to eliminate toxins, harmony can be restored to the body. For this to happen we need total physical and mental rest as well as the work of highly skilled Ayurvedic physicians. Ayurvedic treatments are most successful when they are carried out in a suitably conducive environment - such as the Vaidyagrama Healing Village. Earth, water, fire, air and space are the 5 great elements that compose this cosmos and every individual living being. The belief at Vaidyagrama is that when there is a state of balance between the elements there is peace and health all around both at the individual and cosmic level. At Vaidyagrama, therefore, there is a constant endeavour to keep these 5 elements in balance, and, as participants in their programs, we will feel this harmony at every level in our bodies.
