It's been over 6 weeks and folks are getting restless staying home and loosing work. I hope you are staying safe and healthy while maintaining mental and emotional well-being during these challenging times. We'd like to get back to work too, providing care for our community at a time we need it most. Unfortunately it's difficult to say when the clinic will re-open. We are committed to making sure that staff and clients are safe; so it's vital that we have all the supplies and measures in place when the doors open again. We are lining up suppliers for PPE (masks, sanitizers, gloves, etc.), getting new air purifiers, maybe UV lights, planning for social distancing in our clinic, signing up for laundry service and thoughtfully exploring all the details of operating a community acupuncture practice in the age of Coronavirus. LOOKING AHEAD We are still sorting out all the details, but things are going to change a little when we get back to providing treatments at our clinic. Nothing is certain yet, and there's lots to think about. We may have to reduce the frequency of appointments so there are fewer people in the office at one time. We'll have to use fewer chairs to maintain social distancing and have time limits so that staff can disinfect between clients. And because of reduced capacity and extra expenses we'll likely have to raise our sliding scale (at least at first). We're committed to keeping acupuncture affordable while providing for our staff and keeping the clinic afloat.

Oregon schools will be closed through at least April 28, and a statewide stay-at-home order is in place until Governor Brown withdraws it. National social distancing guidelines have been extended through the end of April. In light of these recommendations, we plan to extend our closure through at least the end of April and are cancelling all previously booked April appointments at this time. It is difficult to predict when we will be able to open our doors again, but we are looking forward to reopening when it is safe and in alignment with official recommendations. When we reopen, we will announce it on our website - [www.AcupunctureForThePeople.org](http://www.acupunctureforthepeople.org) - and send out an email newsletter. Our online schedule will be adjusted to match our availability.

We have tried to provide services and stay open during this time but it has been increasingly difficult to keep up with the demands of risk prevention for our clients and staff. We have weighed all our options and have decided, with a heavy heart, that we must temporarily close the clinic as our community faces the challenges of this pandemic. We plan on closing for 2 weeks, following the lead of our local schools, but it is hard to predict what is in store and when we will be able to safely open our doors again. Our website - www.AcupunctureForThePeople.org will have updates and our online schedule will be adjusted to match our availability. We'll be canceling and notifying everybody on the schedule. Some of our Acupuncturists will be maintaining their private practices and have offered to see clients at a reduced rate during this time.

Follow news and recommendations of the WHO (World Health Organization) https://www.who.int/ And the CDC (Centers For Disease Control) https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html For local info Lane County Public Health www.lanecountyor.gov/coronavirus 3/11/20 - The Coronavirus is big news these days, but there is a lot of confusing information about it out there and it changes daily. It's important to stay calm, don't panic and prepare for disruptions in normal life. What we know so far - the virus is contagious, but it is mostly spread by contact rather than airborne. The best way to stay healthy and stop the spread of disease is to WASH YOUR HANDS; regularly and frequently with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Avoid touching your face and if you have a cough - cough into your elbow, cover your mouth or wear a mask. *Even though Acupuncture is great for your immune system - We will not treat Coronavirus at our clinic! If you think you have it - contact your Doctor or Urgent Care. STAY HOME IF YOU ARE SICK, HAVE A FEVER / CHILLS, ARE SNEEZING / COUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY OR ARE CARING FOR SOMEONE WHO IS. *We are waiving No Show Fees for missed appointments and late cancellations due to illness. The Coronavirus is not particularly deadly for everyone (most people who contract it will get very sick but will recover). Vulnerable populations like the elderly, those with respiratory disease or immune-compromised are at high risk and in danger of death if infected. If you are in this category it is best to stay away from large groups of people and we understand if you choose to avoid the clinic during this time. ACUPUNCTURE FOR THE PEOPLE will be stepping up the sanitation procedures we already have in place at our clinic. We are washing our hands more frequently, wiping down/sanitizing surfaces regularly, washing blankets and changing linens more often, as well as replacing air filters in our HVAC system. "}
