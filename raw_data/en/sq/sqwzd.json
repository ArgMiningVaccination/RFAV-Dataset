Implementing successful clinical protocols is paramount to optimally sustaining wellness, cellular integrity, and healthy aging. As clinicians, we continuously assist our patients with controlling C-Reactive Protein, Sed Rate, IL-6, and an array of inflammatory cytokines. However, we all realize that addressing dysfunctional biochemical processes within the body contributing to inflammation is the proverbial golden key to sustained outcomes. This up-to-date discussion empowers clinicians with the latest research on biochemical interventions with NAD+ regarding inflammation. We will share from the peer-reviewed literature how Niagen\u00ae can help support augmented wellness protocols. Learning Objectives: - Role of NAD+ in Supporting Healthy Inflammatory Processes - Clinical Review of Latest Niagen\u00ae (Nicotinamide Riboside) and Inflammation - Critical Function of the Mitochondria in Inflammatory Response - Diet, Lifestyle and Beyond- Missing Links in Inflammation Management Speaker Dr. Chris D.
