Improve immune defences Support your immune system with astragalus, one of the most important immune herbs in Chinese medicine, where it's traditionally taken to enhance immune defences and help reduce the frequency of common colds. Astragalus is also traditionally used in Western herbal medicine, where it's taken to stimulate healthy immune system responses and support the immune system in fighting illness. This mighty immune herb is found alongside seven other Chinese herbs in [Fusion Astra 8 tablets](https://www.fusionhealth.com.au/fusion-health/shop/immune-health/immune-health/p/astra-8-immune-tonic/FH-ASTRA-T.html?lang=en_AU). 2. Relieve cold and flu symptoms If a common cold or flu hits, consider andrographis to reduce symptoms including cough, runny nose, mild fever, sore throat, tiredness and disturbed sleep. Meanwhile, in Western herbal medicine, echinacea is traditionally used to support the immune system when fighting illnesses like common colds, to relieve common cold symptoms, and decrease their duration. Find echinacea alongside andrographis and the Chinese herbs honeysuckle, forsythia and isatis in [Fusion Cold & Flu tablets](https://www.fusionhealth.com.au/fusion-health/shop/immune-health/cold-and-flu/p/cold-and-flu/FH-COLDFLU-T.html?lang=en_AU). Also [available as a herbal liquid](https://www.fusionhealth.com.au/fusion-health/shop/immune-health/cold-and-flu/p/cold-and-flu-liquid/FH-COLDFLU-L.html?lang=en_AU). 3. Ease coughing and support healthy lung function If your cold includes a cough, consider [Fusion Cough Lung Tonic liquid](https://www.fusionhealth.com.au/fusion-health/shop/immune-health/cold-and-flu/p/cough-lung-tonic-liquid/FH-COUGHLUNG-L.html?lang=en_AU), which contains Chinese licorice, traditionally used to relieve coughs associated with common colds and flu in Chinese medicine.
