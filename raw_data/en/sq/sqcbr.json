Hence, this study aims to assess and identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Portugal. We used data from a community-based survey, \"COVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinion\", which includes data regarding intention to take COVID-19 vaccines, health status, and risk perception in Portugal from September 2020 to January 2021. We used multinomial regression to identify factors associated with intention to delay or refuse to take COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Portugal was high: 56% would wait and 9% refuse. Several factors were associated with both refusal and delay: being younger, loss of income during the pandemic, no intention of taking the flu vaccine, low confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and the health service response during the pandemic, worse perception of government measures, perception of the information provided as inconsistent and contradictory, and answering the questionnaire before the release of information regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. It is crucial to build confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine as its perceived safety and efficacy were strongly associated with intention to take the vaccine. Governments and health authorities should improve communication and increase trust.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-03-22", "cleaned_text": "Factors Associated with COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030300](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030300) [COVID-19 Vaccines Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00300)], the start of the COVID-19 vaccination was a beacon of hope for normal life to return. However, they prompted discussions on vaccination hesitancy as a vaccination program's success will depend on uptake among the population [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00300)]. [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00300), [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00300)]. It has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019 [ [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00300)]. Vaccine hesitancy results from a complex decision-making process, influenced by a wide range of contextual, individual and group, and vaccine-specific factors, including communication and media, historical influences, religion/culture/gender/socioeconomic, politics, geographic barriers, experience with vaccination, risk perception, and design of the vaccination program [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00300)]. A large-scale retrospective study combined previously published data from 284,381 individual responses to the Vaccine Confidence Index survey conducted in 149 countries between 2015 and 2019 to measure confidence (and, conversely, hesitancy) and identified that confidence in vaccines remained low across Europe compared to other continents [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00300)]. While being male, having fewer years of education, or being part of minority religious groups were associated with decreased chances of vaccine uptake, confidence in the importance of vaccines, information-seeking behaviours, and trust in healthcare workers were associated with increased chances [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00300)]. [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00300)], Indonesia [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00300)], Italy [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00300)], Ireland [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00300)], Japan [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00300)], United Kingdom [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00300)], and States [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00300), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00300), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00300), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00300)]. In addition, multicountry surveys have been undertaken in 7 European countries [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00300)], 18 Arab countries [ [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00300)], and 19 countries worldwide [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00300)]. A rapid systematic review identified 23 articles that used surveys to assess confidence in and receptivity for COVID-19 vaccines [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00300)]. Several of these studies indicated that older individuals and those with higher income and education levels were more likely to accept a vaccine [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00300), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00300), [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00300), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00300), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00300)]. Other factors associated with more willingness to be vaccinated included higher trust in government decisions [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00300)], having been vaccinated against the flu in the previous year [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00300), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00300)], perceiving COVID-19 as a threat to self [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00300)] and the community [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00300), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00300)], having health insurance [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300)], knowing people who were infected by COVID-19 [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00300)], and being a health professional [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00300)]. [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00300), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00300), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300)]. Furthermore, the pandemic situation and interventions in place could have affected participants' response at the time of the survey and thus the overall findings [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00300), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00300), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00300)]. As vaccination of the general population starts, an in-depth understanding of the current situation and determinants of vaccine hesitancy is crucial to ensure proper action to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage, allowing attainment of herd immunity. [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00300), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00300)]. Vaccination coverage is highly influenced by its acceptability and the overall perception of its benefit/safety profile. Vaccine hesitancy is a barrier to achieve high vaccination coverage against infectious diseases. Therefore, understanding its determinants is necessary to aid acceptability and tackle vaccine hesitancy [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00300)] and consequently achieve high coverage for this new vaccine. Hence, this study aims to assess and identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Portugal. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00300)]. The survey contains data on perception of risk, health status, social experiences, and use of health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is an open cohort study, where participants can answer the questionnaire once or more than once. Data collection is still ongoing, with more than 185,000 answers by 8 January 2021. The questionnaire is flexible to adjust rapidly to the dynamic situation we are currently experiencing. Our study started on 29 September 2020, when the questions about vaccination were added, and ended on 8 January 2021, almost two weeks after the beginning of COVID-19 vaccination in Portugal [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00300)]. Only the question about the perception of information provided by health authorities was added during the study period, on 24 October 2020. We excluded participants who were not living in Portugal. We decided to do a cross-sectional study using the last response per participant because the number of individuals who answered almost every fortnight was low (n = 48). 2.2. Outcome 2.3. Independent Variables [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00300)]. Due to the current situation, we added a fourth category regarding disease-specific variables. We also created a variable concerning the period of the questionnaire, which was intended to capture possible influences of the information concerning the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and was divided into before (September and October) or after (November to January) this release [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00300), [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00300)]. [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00300-t001)presents the variables considered for this analysis. 2.4. Statistical Analysis [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00300-t001)). Groups included contextual, individual and group, and vaccine-specific influences [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00300)]. Owing to specificities of the pandemic situation, we added a fourth group of disease-specific determinants. Odds ratio (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for all variables. ORs were adjusted for age, gender, education, and period of the questionnaire. 3. Results [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00300-t001)presents the characteristics of the sample. Overall, more women (71.1%) and individuals with a university degree (76.2%) answered the questionnaire. More participants without a university degree answered that they would not take the vaccine than participants with a university degree (13.9% versus 8.2%). The situation was reversed for individuals who would wait before taking the vaccine, with a higher percentage for individuals with a university degree (55.7% versus 50.6%). Individuals who would take the vaccine as soon as possible had a mean \u00b1 standard deviation age of 47.7 \u00b1 13.0 years, while individuals who would wait and would not take the vaccine had a younger mean age of 45.4 \u00b1 12.1 and 44.9 \u00b1 10.2, respectively ( [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00300-t002)). [Supplementary Material](#app1-vaccines-09-00300). The analysis can also be found in the [Supplementary Material](#app1-vaccines-09-00300). 3.1. [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). Individuals with secondary education or individuals without education or with a basic education were more likely not to take the COVID-19 vaccine than individuals with a university degree (No versus Yes, aOR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.66; No versus Wait, aOR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.08, 5.05). Females had higher odds of delaying vaccine intake than males (Wait versus Yes, aOR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.78; No versus Wait, aOR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.89). A higher odds of delay and refusal was also found for individuals who lost income during the pandemic compared to those who did not (Wait versus Yes, aOR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.02, versus Wait, aOR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.12). Students had lower odds of delay compared to workers (Wait versus Yes, aOR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.83), while retired individuals had lower odds of refusal compared to workers (No versus Yes, aOR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.64; No versus Wait, aOR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.83). Regarding the monthly household found ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00300-f001)and [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). [Table S3](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). For individuals without a university degree, the results were no longer significant for gender, age, income loss, and occupation ( [Table S2](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). However, although monthly household income was not significantly associated with intention to take the vaccine, different results were found in the sensitivity analysis. Participants without a university degree and higher household income had lower odds of refusal and delay than households with less than 650 \u20ac per month income ( [Table S2](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). In contrast, participants with a university degree and higher household income had higher odds of delay than participants with household income less than 650 \u20ac per month ( [Table S3](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). However, these results were not consistent among all income classes. 3.2. Determinants of Vaccine Hesitancy: Individual and Group Influences [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00300-f002)and [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). Individuals who perceived their health status as reasonable compared to good or very good had lower odds of refusal (No versus Yes, aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.86). Similarly, individuals with comorbidities had lower than individuals without comorbidities ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00300-f002)and [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). A higher odds of refusal was also found for individuals with school-age children compared to those without (No versus Yes, aOR: 1.93, 95% CI: 2.69). [Table S3](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). In contrast, for individuals without a university degree, the results lost significance for those with school-age children. Higher odds of delay were found for individuals without a university degree who perceived their health status as bad or very bad compared to good or very good (Wait versus Yes, aOR: 3](#vaccines-09-00300-f003)and [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). Lack of confidence in the health service response to the pandemic presented a higher odds of refusal compared to individuals who were very confident with the response (No versus Yes, aOR: 7.56, 95% not consistent for individuals without a university degree, as the perception of the government's measures and the quality of the information provided by health authorities were no longer significantly associated with delay to take the vaccine ( [Table S2](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). 3.4. Determinants of Vaccine Hesitancy: COVID-19 Vaccine Influences [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00300)). Questionnaires answered before the release of information regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines were also strongly associated with higher odds of delay and refusal compared to those who answered after the release of this information (Wait versus Yes, aOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.68, of individuals who would refuse to take the vaccine was similar to the prevalence reported by other studies, which has mainly ranged between 4% study in the USA reported that 31% of the participants were unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300)] while another reported that 20% of the participants were unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine due to the collateral effects and 14% because they do not need the vaccine [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00300)]. However, we also found that 56% of the participants would wait some time or a long time to take the COVID-19 vaccine. To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have explored delay to take the vaccine. Wang et al. [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00300)] found that 43.7% of individuals would delay vaccination until vaccine safety and efficacy were proven, and Mercadante et al. [ [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00300)] found that 42% of individuals would wait a few months before taking the vaccine. Other studies have explored the uncertainty regarding intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine, which ranged between 12% these studies examined uncertainty and not hesitancy. While there is no previously established data on the threat to herd immunity, and it is not entirely clear how long individuals would wait, such high frequency of delay in getting the vaccine is worrisome and requires action. [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00300)]. However, the analysis only included studies conducted up to October 2020, before the release of information regarding the safety and efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccine. Another systematic review, which included studies published up to October 2020, found that concerns over vaccine safety and efficacy were among the main reasons for refusal of the vaccine [ [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00300)]. This is one of the first studies exploring COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy after the release of information regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Our analysis timeframe allowed us to observe a shift in attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination in Portugal, thus demonstrating the time-sensitivity aspect of this construct and how the perception of efficacy and the government's communication may influence vaccine hesitancy. High efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines may increase confidence in them, hence reducing vaccine hesitancy. The government should continue to update the public about side effects to increase confidence in vaccines. It would also be important to understand how the implementation of public health measures influences vaccine hesitancy. During our study period, several public health measures, namely curfews, were tiered at the municipality level according to the incidence in each municipality in Portugal. We were unable to account for these measures as we did not collect information regarding the municipality of the participantsAdditionally, many countries (especially in Europe) have been facing third waves in early 2021 [ [1](#B1-vaccines-09-00300)], and nonpharmaceutical government measures have been constantly implemented and lifted. These new developments in the pandemic have certainly affected the rate of vaccine hesitancy. The progress of COVID-19 vaccination coverage has also most likely influenced time variations in vaccine hesitancy in a complex dynamic. Healthcare workers are one of the first groups to receive COVID-19 vaccination; however, previous studies have found conflicting results concerning vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers for COVID-19 [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00300), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00300)] and other respiratory diseases [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00300), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00300)]. Hence, it will be fundamental to continue monitoring COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy over the following months to adjust measures to tackle vaccine hesitancy, thus ensuring adequate vaccination uptake. [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00300), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00300), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00300)], low or nonexistent perceived risk [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00300), [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00300), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00300), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00300), [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00300)], and trust in the government [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00300)]. We also found that younger individuals had higher odds of refusal and females had higher odds of delay. Although some studies found higher odds of refusal for younger individuals [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00300), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00300), [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00300)], these findings are inconsistent across the literature, with some studies finding no association [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00300), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00300), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00300)] and one study finding men were less likely to take the vaccine [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00300)]. Our study also found that lower trust in/poorer perception of the government and the measures they have implemented, health service response, and information provided by health authorities were associated with delaying or refusing COVID-19 vaccine. Other studies have also reported lack of trust in government/health authorities as factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00300), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00300)]. We found that confidence in the COVID-19 vaccines being developed was associated with higher chances of being vaccinated. Specific vaccine concerns regarding its safety and potential side effects [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00300), [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00300), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300), [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00300), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00300)] are consistently among the main reasons found in the literature for not being vaccinated when the COVID-19 vaccine is ready. We also found that individuals with poorer perception of their health and with comorbidities had lower odds of refusal. [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00300)]. Several studies have reported an association between COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and education [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00300), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00300), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00300), [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00300)]. We found that individuals with lower education levels were more likely not to take the vaccine than individuals with a university degree. Income loss was also associated with higher odds of refusal. Although income loss has not been previously studied, some studies found that intention to take the vaccine was different across different ethnicities and economic situations [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00300), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00300)], suggesting that different socioeconomic backgrounds may have different views regarding COVID-19 vaccination. [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00300)]. [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00300), [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00300)], more than those who seem to be ready to accept such an intervention at this time according to our data. It will be important to devise strategies to meet this threshold as part of a society-wide response to the pandemic. Questionnaires such as ours could be important tools to measure, in a longitudinal fashion, whether we have been able to do so.
