However, late fall and winter, commonly dubbed \"cold and flu season,\" provides an extra reason to keep your body's defenses at their peak! Your skin, mucus membranes, and even nasal hairs and eyelashes all help to defend your body from diseases at the surface level. However, once a pathogen (disease-causing substance) is able enter the body, it's up to your body's cells to protect you. Acupuncture helps these disease-fighting cells to work their best and protect you from illness. Your immune system relies on your body's overall health to maintain its effectiveness. Poor nutrition, stress, and exposure to disease-causing items all increase your risk of getting sick. Especially during winter, when your body is handling the cold weather, the busy nature of the holidays, and the excess of sneezing and coughing people which surround you, it's easy to see how this time of year is known as cold and flu season! How Does Acupuncture Help? One of the best things you can do to increase your body's defenses is to make an acupuncture appointment. First, acupuncture treatments reduce stress, which is a major factor in the immune system's ability to fight off infection. Acupuncture stimulates and balances the immune system in order to create a strong line of defense against any pathogens you may come across. Acupuncture increases the amount of your body's immune cells, such as the red blood cells, white blood cells, and [T-cells](https://www.britannica.com/science/T-cell). It also enhances the immunity of those with immune-related illnesses by encouraging these cells to reproduce and boost the body's defenses. What Makes Acupuncture So Effective? Most conventional treatments are simply directed towards relieving the symptoms, rather than solving the underlying issue. Western medicinal treatments often aim at suppressing the immune system in cases of over activity rather than amending the real issue. These drugs, in addition to skipping over the root cause, may also result in unpleasant and even harmful side effects. Acupuncture is unique in that it boost the immune cells themselves to result in a more effective and long-lasting remedy for immune issues. It reduces the symptoms, speeds up the healing process, and regulates the immune response system. It improves your cells' ability to \"communicate\" with another and therefore increase the abilities of your defense system. Acupuncture treats a variety of conditions, and is especially helpful in reducing your susceptibility to the many illnesses that increase in prevalence during late fall and winter.
