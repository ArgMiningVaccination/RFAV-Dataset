Individuals born during the time of 1946 to 1964 has lived in environments where smoking lead to a detrimental impact in their later years. As the third leading cause of death, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is common among the older population. This disease is the leading cause of both morbidity and mortality. Leading to a consensus that older adults (particularly baby boomers) are at a great risk of COPD because they grew up in an era where smoking was fashionable, cigarettes were provided during the wars, and exposure to secondhand smoke was tremendous. diet, living conditions and regular antibiotic use will be more susceptible. There is a 10:1 ratio of The assessment of risk is a critical part of child welfare advocacy. The review of instruments of different instruments for assessing risk and safety in child welfare focuses on instrument reliability, validity, outcomes, and use with children and families of color. The evaluation of risk assessment instruments generally includes broad categories of areas related to abuse and neglect, behavioral descriptions, procedures to determine levels of risk, and standardized forms to record this information (Rycus & Hughes, 2003). In the process of screening for a case study, instruments are used to determine if the child or family needs further assessment, treatment, or intervention services. In evaluating the Van Sise family I have found that the following In 1999, Atul Gawande published a paper on the \"Cancer-Cluster Myth\", which he described at the beginning of the page as, \"When a dozen people in a neighborhood develop tumors, it can't be a coincidence. Or can it?\" In other words, Gawande roughly defined the \"Cancer-Cluster Myth\" as a conglomeration of diseases concentrated in one area of living having to have some sort of connection. Gawande was a surgeon, writer, and public health researcher who practices general and endocrine surgery at Brigham and Women's hospital (Atul Gawande, \"Bio\" 2014). His research has generally been focused on the intersection of surgery and public health, which has examined error in surgery, establishing its frequency and seriousness and revealing underlying mechanisms (Atul Gawande, \"Bio\" 2014). Around the cancer-cluster myth, during the past two decades (keep in mind that the paper was written in 1999), reports of cancer-clusters have soared. The idea of scientific authority has played an impactful role throughout industrialized society. As the production of knowledge through scientific research is constantly developing, new discoveries have a major influence in policies and practices that influence both social and scientific structures. In a seminar held by Dr. Hayes Bautista, a professor for Chicano Studies Community Medicine 106, he discussed health within the Latino population and his research on The Latino Epidemiological Paradox in terms of science, theory, and data. His research not only questions scientific research and health models, but pose questions that challenge systems surrounding healthcare. The nurse currently does not provide any direct, hands-on patient care; instead, the nurse educates patients for health related issues over phones. The nurse notices that one of her patients, an 89-year-old male, takes Warfarin, an anticoagulant therapy, after a cardiovascular disease was diagnosed. Warfarin inhibits the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase to prevent the reduction of vitamin K, which is a step necessary for activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X (Van Berkel, Crannage, & Murphy, 2013). The patient follows the doctor's recommendation for completing blood work to ensure the medication is consistently within the therapeutic level. Therefore, the International Normalized Ratio (INR), prothrombin time To explain this estimator take the following example: Let S(t) be the probability that a member from a given population will have a lifetime exceeding time, t. For a sample of size N from this population, let the observed times until death of the N sample members be A rising number of hospitals throughout the U.S. are applying a service model known as integrated health care (Kathol, Perez, Cohen 2010). The need for this is center around this area: 2. I have goals that I look forward to accomplishing in the next year. 6 5 4 3 2 1 Many legal challenges exist for case managers but documentation is big liability issue. We have to think because a case manager works in diverse roles were there are potential legal and ethical challenges that exist around every corner. Reading the article regarding liability and case management one of things the article mention is deciding on care for patients when it comes to cost saving without regard to the treatment regimen.\" It is important that a case manager not make decision based on the economic status of client but do comparison shopping for the right care for the client. Other areas of liabilities is the lack of following up with all the health care providers who are involve in managing different parts of the patient care. Example My research question was to identify the association between socioeconomic, biopsychosocial, environmental and genetic factors, and the development of childhood asthma. To establish the effect of allergen (cockroaches, dust), poverty, poor air ventilation in a house, racial factors and air pollution on developing children asthma, a cohort have to have a exposure and the cohort need to followed over time. Cohort studies are used to study the incidence, causes, natural history of a disease and prognosis.1 Because they measure events in the chronological order, they can be used to distinguish between cause and effect.1 This type of study is the best method for determining the incidence and natural history of a disease or condition.1 One of the advantages of doing retrospective cohort study is that the data already collected for some other research study or purposes. The cohort is \"followed up\" retrospectively.1 The study period may be many years but the time to complete the study is only as long as The risk management process establishes the methodology for risk enterprises framework for the of many businesses (Fraser & Simkins, 2010). A retail business such as Target needs to do a risk assessment to establish the types of risks being faced by the organization. The risk assessment process starts with the identification and categorization of risk factors. High customer interaction of the retail businesses like Target, need to identify risk as a continuous basis effort over the lifetime of the business (Mandru, 2016). It important that the business leaders, set goals and priorities for the risk management system. The goals created for the organization have to be aligned with the strategic goals and overall mission of the entire organization. More and more people have cancer these days. It is almost like the plague that no one wants to talk about, and it keeps getting worse. Given the risk considerations provided in the RCD tool and the Portfolio Theory, the next step should be understanding the available risk/return metrics and determining an optimal mix of assets. This assignment has impacted my perspective on evidence-based practice by helping me build clinical reasoning skills and knowledge of difference diagnoses that will enables me to apply the most high-quality and appropriate intervention strategies that is proven effective in improve patient's treatment outcome.
