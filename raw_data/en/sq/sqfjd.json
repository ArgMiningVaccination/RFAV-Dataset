In the context of per- vasive economic liberalism and shrinking budgets due to a deep and prolonged re-cession, the exigency of humanities research for society is increasingly put intoquestion, even within academia. Why should governments nance research thatdoes not generate computable and marketable results? Are the immediate costsworth the alleged long-term social benets? Similar arguments are also madeabout the arts and culture more generally - one of the main elds of inquiry in humanities scholarship, past and present. With Contemporary Culture: New Directions in Arts and Humanities Research , we want to show that the humanities matter and in fact offer much-needed insights into contemporary cultural and social practices, thus opening up new ways of understanding the cultural contexts that shape societal transformation. The essays in this volume come out of a large-scale research program that was initiated in 2002 by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientic Research (NWO).The Transformations in Art and Culture programme was launched with two aims. It challenged scholars to think how the humanities could contribute to a better un-derstanding of present-day processes of cultural and social change. The pro-gramme also aimed at reinvigorating the theoretical foundations and conceptualframeworks of humanities research and at building bridges with other elds of inquiry, notably the social sciences and the arts. By doing so, NWO sought to en- rich the scholarly debates about the nature and future of the humanities and thusset the agenda for the years to come, well beyond the scope of the program itself. This volume investigates how the interlocked processes of mediatization, globalization and commercialization have shaped cultural practices, socialbehaviour and feelings of belonging since the 1990s. While it is not a book aboutnew media per se, most essays directly or indirectly address the profound impactof new information and communication technologies on everyday life. Theintroduction of the World Wide Web thereby gures as the implicit starting pointfor studying new modes of cultural production, distribution and consumption ascatalysts for societal change. While such a perspective runs the risk of epochalthinking, overlooking continuities and relations to earlier periods, there is little9doubt that the rapid expansion of new ICT technologies, fuelled by intensied globalization and commercialization after the dissolution of the Soviet Union,have changed the world profoundly, propelling us into a new stage of history. In methodological respect, this volume favours non-hierarchical dialogues between theorization and empirical investigation. It stands for so-called middle-level research as opposed to Grand Theory. Middle research, as David Bordwellpoints out, is \"problem- rather than doctrine-driven\" and thus allows scholarsto \"combine traditionally distinct spheres of inquiry\". 1Localized questions, interdisciplinary approaches and \"piecemeal theorizing\" unite most essays inthis volume. Theory is primarily deployed as an instrument to integrate theempirical ndings and case studies into larger frames of interpretation. As a con-sequence, the authors offer modest proposals rather than overarching theoreti-cal explanations of the workings of culture in contemporary society. Moreover,their work repeatedly calls into question the vested hierarchies that stratify thecultural eld and compartmentalize the study of its institutions. The authorsbroaden the spectrum of analysis to include insights from related academic disci-plines as well as from the arts. By doing so, they draw up new interdisciplinaryways of thinking about art, popular culture, media entertainment and thedynamics of urban life. At the heart of the present book are questions surrounding the issue of media- tization, that is, the long-term meta-process of the increased and pervasivespreading of technological communication media and media organizations. Inpostmodern society, the latter have become instrumental in dening the stakesand the patterns that structure human behaviour in all spheres of social life.Andreas Hepp refers to this function as the \"moulding forces of the media\". 2 Knut societies\" wherein \"the media areeverywhere, all-embracing\", and he follows Scott Lash in considering it the keycharacteristic of the second modernity. 3\"The rst modernity describes a process of rationalization. And the second modernity describes one of mediatization\",according to Lash. 4Along similar lines, John B. Thompson has argued in The Media and Modernity: A Social Theory of the Media (1995) that since the inven-tion of the printing press, communication mediated by way of technology (asopposed to face-to-face interaction) has irreversibly altered our sense of space,time and community as well as the frameworks for self-formation and self-understanding, for reflection and action both in the public and private sphere.Thompson proposed to analyze systemic cultural transformations by focusing\"on symbolic forms and their modes of production and circulation in the socialworld\", instead of taking mentalit\u00e9s - values, attitudes and beliefs - as the start- ing point for understanding changes in contemporary society. 5In line with Thompson, a strong emphasis on cultural practices (rather than on institutions)characterizes the contributions to this volume. Drawing on the well-established10 introductiontradition of audience-oriented research within cultural studies, the authors demonstrate a clear preference for studying social and cultural processes fromthe bottom up. Instead of examining top-down forgings of collective identity,notably by the nation-state and its key institutions (e.g. state-controlled mediaplatforms like public television), they offer an exploration of the processes offragmentation, deterritorialization and disintegration of existing cultural andsocial spheres as well as the formation of new ones. Structure of the book The book is divided into four sections and concludes with an outlook on thechallenges that the humanities face today. The rst part is devoted to \"mediacities\". It establishes a larger context within which most contributions to thisvolume t because cities are generally seen as the cradle of modernity and themost dynamic places for art, culture and creativity. Urban-based lifestyles,rooted in the mixed socio-cultural backgrounds of metropolitan populations,are vitally important for the construction and performance of identity and thedevelopment of new modes of sociability and social cohesion. However, as Ren\u00e9Boomkens points out in his opening essay, \"the interesting thing about cities isthat there does not exist any serious formalized knowledge about them\". Theyare primarily studied as prominent examples of society or specic examples ofinfluential political institutions, he argues, but there is no theory dening whatcities and urban life are actually about. Boomkens offers the beginning of anintegrative approach by dening cities as a cultural reality . He breaks away with reductionist, mono-disciplinary approaches to develop the notion of the city as awhole way of life . Evaluating a varied body of critical thinking and research on urban public culture, he investigates the historical continuities and contempo-rary discontinuities at work in urban culture and its public sphere in relation tothe increased mediatization and denationalization of \"the everyday\". Boomkens' philosophical analysis is grounded in the case studies of Judith Vega, Martijn de Waal and Martijn Oosterbaan. Oosterbaan examines the on-and offline practices of Brazilian migrants in Amsterdam and Barcelona. Hisanthropological eld work revealed that social network sites such as Orkut andBrasileiros na Holanda are not only used by migrants to keep in contact withfriends and relatives around the world or to exchange practical information onlocal living conditions, but also function as public platforms for (trans)nationalpolitical debates and diasporic identity formation. More importantly, he foundthat these virtual communities do not replace or hamper face-to-face encountersamong Brazilian migrants. On the contrary: the multiple, interlocked networksof online and offline communities constitute a decentred, transnational publicsphere rooted in the city as well as in cyberspace. Judith Vega and Martijn de11 Judith ThissenWaal approach the cultural reality of the city from the perspective of the visual arts and the ways in which they shape our perception of urban life and(post)modernity. As actual embodiments of urban subjectivity and interaction,Vega argues, paintings and city lms provide the spectator with a sensory ratherthan a discursive experience of the urban public sphere and offer, intentionally ornot, a far more fragmented and less linear understanding of the functioning ofthe modern city than urban theories typically present. Whereas Vega zooms inon examples from art history, Martijn de Waal focuses on the contemporary artscene. Grounded in a close analysis of the interactive video installation Body Movies - Relational Architecture 6 by the Mexican artist Rafael Lozano-Hem- mer, he demonstrates how new media technologies have profoundly altered theurban fabric and invites us to view the city itself as an interface, followingManuel Castells' interpretation of the city as a communication system and mate-rial reflection of shared social representations, but expanding it beyond the phys-ical urban space to include blogs and social network sites. Part II focuses on the notions of play and the \"ludic turn\" in contemporary cul- ture. This section brings together two very different strands of thinking aboutdigital culture and consumer participation. The team around philosopher Josde Mul makes the case for taking \"play\" seriously. Their intellectual startingpoint is Homo Ludens, a study of play by the renowned Dutch historian Johan Huizinga, originally published in 1938. This work has been remarkably neg-lected in the Netherlands over the last decades, in sharp contrast to its interna-tional comeback. Combining a critical assessment of Huizinga's conceptualiza-tion of play and empirical research into playful practices in the realm of digitalmedia (mobile telephones, games), Frissen, De Mul and Raessens propose a newtheory of play and playfulness, which overcomes the contradictions and ambigu-ities in Huizinga's study and effectively addresses the ludication of contempo-rary culture in relation to postmodern identity formation. An altogether opti-mistic interpretation of consumer agency characterizes their approach as well asthe case studies by Michiel de Lange and Sybille Lammes. With a keen eye for thenarrative dimensions of everyday life, including her own use of the social net-work game Foursquare on her commute to university, Lammes explores how digital maps change our sense of place and space by looking at cartographicapplications for smartphones. With Michiel de Lange, the urban setting shiftsfrom Amsterdam to Jakarta, where he examines how in the Indonesian contextof consumer society the culture of mobile phones is positioned between the art ofmodern socializing (bergaul) and the display of prestige (gengsi). Like Lammes, his analysis not only focuses on how identities are fashioned through media useand storytelling but also take into account the playful conditions under whichthese identities are produced. 12 introductionRen\u00e9e van de Vall adopts a more cautious attitude towards the participatory potential of new media technologies in her reflection on digital gaming, which is grounded in the empirical studies carried out by her research team composedof Ren\u00e9 Glas, Martijn Hendriks and Maaike Lauwaert. She systematically ad - dresses issues of power and control, thereby drawing attention to the ways inwhich the economic interests of the game industry shape play practices and thuslimit players' agency and choice. Yet, a small minority of players - typicallyhighly active and dedicated users - do engage in deviating play practices andother transgressive activities to expand their playing space beyond the hardware,software and contractual boundaries imposed by game producers. Ren\u00e9 Glas'study of regulatory mechanisms and creative practices in and around World ofWarcraft provides an acute insight into the complex, multifaceted relationship between game designers and fans who appropriate World of Warcraft materials to develop their own artistic projects. While this kind of detailed empiricalresearch of active gamers offers much-needed empirical grounding for theoriesof interactivity and participatory cultures, De Vall convincingly argues that whatis still missing are studies of hardly-active users and people who do not careabout games and other new media platforms such as social network sites. Over-looked by new media scholarship, knowledge of what drives the people toengage in new media practices or not, may well turn out to be crucial for ourunderstanding of contemporary digital culture in all its complexity. Part III - Thinking Analogue - opens with a methodological essay by Karin Bijsterveld, Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, Annelies Jacobs and Bas Jansen. Playing upon the dif-ference between analogue and digital technological thinking, and drawingnotably on insights from Science and Technology Studies (STS), they develop theconcept of \"analogies\" as a methodological tool to investigate transformationsin cultural practices from a comparative perspective, whereby they distinguishbetween analogies made by the historical actors themselves (e.g. consumers, pro-ducers) and analogies made for analytical purposes by the researchers whoinvestigate cultural practices. Their approach is exemplied by looking at theways in which new sound technologies triggered (or not) changes in music listen-ing, recording, sampling and archiving and how these new practices shape musi-cal memories. Tape recorders, for example, facilitated the conservation andexchange of personal sound souvenirs, while the multimedia Top 2000, a yearlyve-day broadcast event of all-time hit songs on Dutch radio, has evolved into avehicle for collective nostalgia and reminiscing. In Bas Jansen's case study, theanalogies strategy is successfully deployed to get a grip on the cultural and socialdynamics at work in the online ccMixter community, disclosing the various roles- remixer, genealogist and reviewer - that members assume to ensure a fair sys-tem of credit-giving within a sharing cultural economy. 13 Judith ThissenPart IV deals with the hybrid practices of the art-science CO-OPs projects that were set up by NWO and partners within the framework of the Transformations in Art and Culture programme to foster theoretical innovation within humani- ties scholarship and stimulate the exchange of ideas, concepts and research prac-tices between academics and artists. For those working in the natural sciencescollaboration with artists has become commonplace, but this kind of interdisci-plinary teamwork was and still is in an experimental phase within the humani-ties and social sciences. As a result, the challenges were sometimes underesti-mated, in particular the need to nd a common language to bridge twofundamentally different modes of thinking: one focused on the visual, the othergeared towards the production of words and texts. Nonetheless, the CO-OPscontributions to this volume conrm that hybrid practices have great potentialfor the development of new academic insights. After a short introduction byRobert Zwijnenberg, who situates the CO-OPs programme in the larger publicdebate about the social relevance of science and technology, four teams reflectupon their project and its outcomes. The rst two essays in this section focus on contemporary art. Art historian Kitty Zijlmans and Ni Haifeng, a Chinese-born, Amsterdam-based artist, inves-tigated in a series of installations the globalization of trade and the concomitantcirculation of people, products and ideas, questioning concepts like freedom,borders, and passports. In mutual dialogue, Zijlmans and Ni reveal how theirLaboratory on the Move project induced them to rethink their respective posi- tions within an increasingly global art system and vis-\u00e0-vis each other. In\"Embedded in the Dutch Art World\" by Judith Thissen, the central focus shiftsfrom globalization to commercialization. Her collaboration with the Americanmultimedia artist Edith Abeyta was part of a larger research project on the econ-omization of culture in the Netherlands. Instead of exploring the dynamics ofexchange and co-creation that emerge when an artist and an academic worktogether, Thissen takes their own experience as a case to study the political econ-omy of the Dutch eld of contemporary art, using Pierre Bourdieu's sociology ofculture to disclose the capitalist logic at work in the not-for-prot art sector. A strong engagement with history and science characterized the projects dis- cussed in the last two chapters. Back to the Roots was initiated by Alex van Stipriaan, a specialist of Caribbean history, and explored what roots and culturalheritage mean in a globalized world. This art-science project involved a mixedgroup of upcoming talent and established artists, all of Afro-Caribbean back-ground. In his essay, Van Stipriaan relates with careful attention for the intensepersonal emotions involved, the group's physical and artistic journey in search oftheir African roots and place in Dutch society. DNA research played a key role inBack to the Roots. In the Observatory Observed, scientic technology also g-ured prominently but primarily as object of scholarly and artistic fascination.14 introductionGeert Somsen, a historian of science and Jeroen Werner, a visual artist whose work consists of optical installations, discuss the insights gained from their jointexploration of observatories, ranging from a massive fteenth-century stonequadrant in Samarkand to the high-tech radio telescope in thenorth of the Netherlands. Werner's Moonzoom and Zonzoom installations at the Sonnenborgh observatory in Utrecht and Discovery 07 in Amsterdam were re-ceived with great enthusiasm by the organizers, the media and the general publicalike. The team concludes with a critical reflection on this apparent success as theypoint at the underlying motivations of their institutional sponsors, who seemedabove all concerned with marketing a hip image of science. In the nal section - Looking Back, Looking Forward - the present volume is more rmly situated in the framework of the Transformation in Art and Culture programme, its history, contingencies and impact. In an open dialogue, Jos\u00e9 vanDijck and Robert Zwijnenberg, the driving forces behind the programme, assessits results and share their views on the challenges of humanities scholarship inthe years to come. They passionately call for a more engaged humanities thatreclaims a stronger position in the public sphere. In their view, the humanitiescan play a crucial role in social innovation when its scholars work in multidisci-plinary teams that cover the full range of academic research, including the natu-ral sciences, and demonstrate that different forms of knowledge can mutuallyreinforce each other. Van Dijck and Zwijnenberg thus draw the contours of anext chapter in arts and humanities scholarship, in which the humanitiesstrengthen their relevance within academia and for society at large, while main-taining their core values: critical reflection, analytical nuance and historical con-sciousness.

The sociological opposition betweenthe face-to-face culture of pre-modern villages and the abstract, mediated andcomplex culture of modern cities as an opposition between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft, introduced by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies, has become the commonplace of more than hundred years of urban sociology and theory. His sociological contem-porary, Georg Simmel, described social life in cities as mediated by a money econ-omy that stimulated what he called a blas\u00e9 attitude in urban encounters, while cul- tural philosopher Walter Benjamin described modern urban culture as theproduct of a rupture with a continuity-based, traditional communal experience inwhich experience as such is replaced by what he called Erlebnisse, instantaneous,homogenous and isolated sensations, on the one hand, and shocks on the other. 1 Although a certain nostalgia for a world-gone-by always rang through these soci-ological descriptions of urban culture, the overall feeling was that of an urban cul-ture as the engine of renewal, experiment and social, political and economic free-dom. For Benjamin, for instance, modern urban culture and its crucial publicspaces like boulevards, squares and crowded shopping arcades represented thephantasmagorical dreamworld of the new capitalist commodity culture as well asthe promise of a more egalitarian, transparent society, and also the birthplace of anew, individualist culture with the fl\u00e2neur (the stroller) as emblematic subject of a new, modern and experimental culture. Without using the term, Benjamin was the19rst to identify modern city life with its public dimensions, i.e. with public culture, the public sphere or public domain. He even spent more than ten years of his life(1927-1940) documenting almost all aspects of the public life of the most impor-tant European city of the nineteenth century, Paris, in his so-called Arcades Project (Das Passagenwerk), the unnished attempt to write a critical history of \"the cap-ital of the nineteenth century\", as Benjamin called Paris. 2 Although unnished and only published long after his death, Benjamin's Arcades Project can now be seen as one of the most important testimonies of the modern awareness of the complex, contradictory but crucial role of cities andurban culture in present-day societies. The interesting thing about cities is thatthere does not exist any serious formalized knowledge about them. There arecountless theories, models and systematic accounts of what we call \"society\",and the same is true for \"the state\" and comparable political institutions. Butalthough cities, in fact, represent rather prominent examples of \"society\" andcan also be studied as examples of influential political institutions, even of\"states\" (like Singapore or Hong Kong), a convincing (or some examples of aconvincing) theory or model of what cities are about, what kind of societies theyare, or how we can assess them as political systems, is, in fact, lacking. In fact,the most persistent and important perspective on cities that was able to give acomplete and encompassing account of urban life has always been a cultural one, being the only perspective in which overarching dimensions of economy, politicsand social relations could be adapted to the material and spatial reality of urbanlife. To say that cities should be approached as a cultural reality is saying that they represent an important collective framework of meaning - in other words,an important centre of knowledge, power, imagination, ideology and fantasy. Toapproach cities in this manner means to consider them as a whole way of life , what could help to overcome the limitations and one-sidedness of the differentsocial-scientic disciplines that are occupied with cities and urban culture. Mostof these limitations are not problematic as such, and simply belong to the specictheoretical or disciplinary perspective from which certain aspects of urban real-ity are approached. The problem is, and has long been, that mono-disciplinaryperspectives (economic, geographical, demographical, sociological) often werepresented as accounts of \"the whole way of urban life\". Reconstructing the influence of several urban discourses in the twentieth cen- tury, one might say that three discourses have played a dening role in the devel-opment of urban culture: a politico-technological discourse of modernizationand large-scale development, which was really dominant from the 1920s untilthe 1970s and was backed by the specialized expertise of the social sciences; anartistic and intellectual discourse of experiment, shock and invention that some-times backed up and sometimes conflicted with the rst discourse; and, nally, amore dispersed but nonetheless influential discourse of \"the urban everyday\",20 mediacitysupported by ethnographic accounts of urban culture, qualitative sociological studies of typically urban subcultures and social groups and movements, and bythe artistic and literary urban imaginary of novels, short stories, journalism,lms and photography. Only recently this third and rather dispersed and heterogeneous discourse gained more prominence in scientic research and philosophical reflection onurban culture, thanks to the anthropological turn in the elds of urban sociol-ogy, cultural and technology studies, and to accompanying attempts at con-structing (or reconstructing) a perspective on urban culture as a whole way of life.At the same time, however, more precisely since the 1980s, rapid changes in global economic relations and power, and the growing influence of new media ofinformation and communication, from satellite television to the Internet, emailand mobile phones, inaugurated a new discourse and debate on urban cultureand urbanization worldwide, stressing a change or even rupture in the continuityof modern urban culture. This rupture was addressed along several contrastingand overlapping lines of argument; in architectural and urban development cir-cles notions like megacities (several authors) or of a generic city (Rem Koolhaas) surfaced, most of them approaching urban culture and development as an issueof scale, or as Koolhaas would say, bigness. 3Political economists or theorists like Sassen or Davis highlighted the rapid changes in socio-economic relations pro-duced by a new globalizing economy. Sassen pointed at the rise of new global cities as a tight network of global nancial, informational and economic rela- tions and as the sites of new tensions between a quasi-cosmopolitan economicand cultural elite and a growing underclass of underpaid and often illegal foreignworkers 4, while Davis described the simultaneous rise of what he called a \"planet of slums\" and a whole series of \"evil paradises\", referring respectively tothe enormous growth of slums of poverty and unemployment in cities like Lagos,Jakarta or S\u00e3o Paulo, and to the new centres of wealth and economic power likeDubai or Abu Dhabi, and the often gated and closed resorts of the extremelywealthy in many megacities all over the world. 5 In urban anthropology and with authors from different disciplines who were influenced by ethnographic research and an anthropological viewpoint, thesenew, globalizing tendencies provided a welcome opportunity to put forwardonce again their perspective on (urban) culture as an overlapping and interactingseries of meaningful and meaning-producing practices that must be seen as con-stituents of that whole way of life , without suggesting that this whole way of life should be seen as a closed system or organic body. Their perspective of urbanculture as a whole way of life is on the one hand critical of reductionist ap - proaches of city life that can be found in several disciplines, including anthropol-ogy itself. Two especially harmful forms of reductionism are functionalism inmodern urban sociology, which reduces cities and urban culture to the famous21 Ren\u00e9 Boomkensfour functions of dwelling, labour, leisure and trafc (a reduction that was too often interpreted as an argument for spatial zoning of these four functions), andspatial determinism, in which the whole way of life in cities was thought of to beessentially spatial in character and causation. On the other hand the perspective of cities as a whole way of life was seen as the best, most complete and differentiated way to deal with the recent accelera-tions in the process of globalization, by supplying the most complete and com-prehensive account of the changes they produced, and so providing the best con-ditions to answer the question whether these recent changes really affected thecontinuity of modern urban culture to the extent that we can now speak of apost-urban condition in one way or the other, or whether these changes, in fact,must be seen as minor adaptations of urban culture to new challenges. One ofthese anthropologists, Marc Aug\u00e9, introduced the concept of supermodernity to sum up the effects of these recent changes. 6Supermodernity perfectly reflects the ambiguity that is characteristic for most of the anthropology-based studies ofrecent developments in urban culture and city life: on the one hand it suggestssome form of continuation of modernity and on the other it presents this contin-uation as a new, maybe higher, but possibly exaggerated form of modernity. Tobe able to clarify the importance and surplus value of this discourse of urban cul-ture as a whole way of life, I will dwell for a short moment with the most impor-tant discourses on urban culture and public life that went before. Goodbye to Gutenberg After 1968 more and more intellectuals, artists and young people in the Westernworld opposed the self-evident character of modernization, backed by strongphilosophical and sociological criticism of the apparent decay of urban publiclife under the pressure of that same process of modernization. Without anydoubt the most important and influential voices of this criticism were those ofphilosophers Hannah Arendt and J\u00fcrgen Habermas, cultural sociologist Ri - chard Sennett, and urban planning critic and activist Jane Jacobs. Arendt pro-vided the foundation. 7Her thorough analysis of modern political life as domi- nated by socio-economic interests that overshadowed and disrupted the crucialrole of the public sphere as the sphere of free speech and action and of active citizenship, inspired Habermas and Sennett to write their seminal studies in which the decay of the urban public sphere was the central issue. 8For Habermas this decay was the result of the growing power of commercial media and ofprocesses of monopolization of economic power in twentieth-century capitalistsocieties; for Sennett it was the product of a shift from a theatrical and presenta-tional public culture, dating back to the eighteenth century, to a new culture ofauthenticity, representation and immanence, that developed in the nineteenth22 mediacitycentury and that represented a growing colonization of the public sphere by pri- vate values (\"authenticity\" and \"representation\" referring back to values crucialto family life and \"immanence\" referring to the identication of personal iden-tity with material wealth and property instead of transcendent notions ofbelonging). Although I think their analyses of nineteenth- and twentieth-centurypublic life produced a whole series of important and lasting insights, they alsoshare a tendency to identify eighteenth-century city life in Europe as the one andonly birthplace of modern urban culture and its practices and values as the stan-dard by which its further development can and must be measured. WhereasHabermas left the issue of urban public sphere behind in later research, Sennett wrote at least two more important studies of contemporary city life, in which notonly the historical perspective on urban culture was broadened, but where, moreimportantly, a more ethnographical perspective on public culture was developedthat comes close to the whole way of life perspective I intend to develop in this essay. 9 The nal voice was that of Jane Jacobs. More than anyone else she, without explicitly intending to do so, produced the rst important attempt to develop aperspective on urban culture as a whole way of life in her The Death and Life ofGreat American Cities 10. Of course, her book was preceded by Benjamin's Arcades Project , but to be honest, his goal never really was accomplished. Cul- tural critic Lewis Mumford belittled Jacobs' book on urban reality as being writ-ten from the perspective of a housewife and that set the scene. 11Here a classic \"God's eye view\" on urban reality confronted the view of an arbitrary Manhat-tan housewife who thought she could stop the forces of modernization by justcalling her neighbours to arms. Mumford objected to that same modernizationeven more strongly than Jacobs, identifying modernity with the evils of techno-logical rationalization. Jacobs was a completely different type of intellectual,and to be more precise: she pregured the so-called specic intellectual , a new role for scientists, scholars, artists and journalists Michel Foucault introduced in1978, contrasting it with the classical bourgeois notion of the \"universal intellec-tual\", who speaks out in the name of everyone, of \"the people\", of the \"generalinterest\". 12The specic intellectual is a specialized expert who speaks out in public because his or her expertise seems to be of a more general, public interest.Jacobs did not speak in universalizing terms; she just told a story about her owncity that happened to be relevant for a whole series of urban problematics andpractices. She must have been condent of the trafc of theories and criticisms.Her story was critical about the abstract and formalizing discourse of modernbureaucratic city planning, and it was positive about a pragmatic and communalattitude towards urban culture and city life, without idealizing any form of com-munity life as foundation or quintessence of urban culture. City life consists ofall kinds of individual activities and of all kinds of communal or collective prac-23 Ren\u00e9 Boomkenstices - and we should neglect none of them. But, most important of all was the rupture Jacobs' book represented with the Gutenbergian perspective on the pub-lic sphere as the essence of modern urban culture. Hers was a perspective on themany tiny and silly affairs of everyday life, the wordless experiences of observinga stranger in the street or paying for your hot dog, or just putting your litter bagon the street. The Gutenbergian perspective was that of literacy, of identifyingurban public culture with deliberation, debate, with an educated public, andwith organizations and institutions that were installed to stimulate \"publicdebate\" and \"cultural and artistic literacy\". Jacobs was the rst to just neglectthese denitions of urban culture. She presented the rst, and of course in termsof present-day experiences in some respects outdated, discourse on urban cultureas a whole way of life. For Jacobs the whole life of urban culture consisted of the simultaneous pres- ence of at least four different participants of that way of life: residents, localentrepreneurs, regular visitors and, nally, one-time visitors. Residents and localentrepreneurs represent the continuity of urban culture, but cannot survive with-out the discontinuous and relatively unpredictable presence of regular and one-time visitors. Why should we accept this picture of urban culture as a relevantaccount of the whole way of life it seems to have to represent? The answer to that question is a normative one: the discourse on urbanity has always been self-eval-uative in a cognitive, normative and critical way, or to put it differently: its schol-arly relevance has always been closely connected to its political and moral rele-vance and usefulness. This was true for philosophical accounts of the city likethose of Simmel, Arendt or Habermas, but also for the architectural and urbanistdiscourse of the modernist movement, or for the urban sociologists of theChicago School. The political and moral relevance and usefulness of the moderncity, so much we can say, is closely connected to its crucial role in creating andmaintaining the public sphere and public culture as the cornerstone of a modern,democratic way of life. This is not the same as claiming that urban culture is a precondition for democratic politics, nor that all cities are essentially democratic, but it is simply a reference to a long modern tradition of democratic experience inwhich cities played a crucial role. And here Jacobs leaves the Gutenbergian, intel-lectualist version of the public sphere behind, and creates the opportunity to re-think urban public culture in a more comprehensive and at the same time morecomplex or even hybrid manner. Mediacity? Jacobs' flight forward out of the trenches of modernist urban planning paved theway for the more recent anthropological turn in urban theory and research, butthe most important causes of this turn must be found \"out there\": in the real24 mediacityworld of globalization. And although \"globalization\" as a concept seemed to suggest a continuity of general modernist notions of \"progress\" or \"evolution\"on a higher level or with a higher speed, in fact, the opposite proved to be thecase. The most important dimensions of globalization were its decentredness,the blurring of the traditional spatial opposition between centre and periphery,the network-character of globalized social, economic and cultural relations and,nally - as a consequence of these dimensions - the return or resurrection of acertain sense of place, of the relevance or meaning of specic places and spatially bound practices. This is the paradox of globalization, by some authors caught inthe concept of glocalization. Thanks to this newspeak we are able to pin down what we might call the most intriguing and troubling aspect of globalization: theaspect of being a generalizing or universalizing process in all dimensions ofhuman life, while at the same time diversifying human life to the extent of enlarg-ing socio-economic and cultural segregation, of highlighting ethnic, local ornational differences, and of undermining existing traditions of communal trustor political unity. One of these traditions is that of urban culture and city life andits role as source or material precondition of trust in local and national democ-racy. The combination of generalizing and diversifying (or specializing) humanculture has always been a central characteristic of what we, thanks to thephilosopher Immanuel Kant, identify as \"the process of rationalization\" - ormore straightforward: as \"Enlightenment\"; but the new element globalizationintroduced (thereby contradicting the whole idea of \"rationalization\") was theabsence of a centre, an easily identiable engine or, indeed, ratio of the whole process. With the absence of a centre comes the absence of a leading force, a class in the Marxist sense, or a dening role for a political or economic elite, some-thing that might explain the enormous success of Hardt and Negri's Empire, 13a complex and intriguing attempt at \"organizing\" the resistance against an empirewithout a capital, without a leading class or elite, without a centre. Next to this rather hyperbolic attempt of Hardt and Negri to create unity where no apparent unifying forces can be found, there are at least two trends toaddress the most manifest effects of globalization on modern urban culture andthe public sphere. On one side of the theoretical spectre we can nd a wholeseries of attempts to conceptualize the dominating trends in the process of glob-alization in the traces of a critical theory of society: here we nd the contribu-tions of authors like Manuel Castells, Arjun Appadurai, Ash Amin and NigelThrift, Stephen Graham, Michel Maffesoli, Jodi Dean, Zygmunt Bauman andothers. They all address the general ontological question of the systematic conse-quences of the process of globalization and come up with provisional models ofnew social orders and new types of sociability, from Castells' network society toDean's communicative capitalism , from Appadurai's diasporic Graham's notion of planetary urban networks.14On the other side there is a strong trend, partly in the slipstream of Jacobs, partly inspired by philosophers like Henri Lefebvre and Michel de Certeau, to focus on the smallestdetails of the urban everyday in an attempt to show the day-to-day transforma- tions of urban culture from a semi-participatory perspective. 15Here, characteris- tically, a mixture of an ethnographic, narrative-style research and a social andaesthetic activism reminiscent of famous urban artistic avant-gardes like surreal-ism and situationism is predominant. Evaluating this recent body of theory and research of the transformations of urban public culture, it is difcult to come up with a clear and convincing pic-ture, but a few dominant tendencies stand out. First of all the idea of a doubling of urban reality and the public sphere. The suggestion that the urban publicsphere is being replaced or undermined by a global network of digital media, that resounded from earlier accounts on \"cyberspace\" or \"virtual reality\" (cf.,for instance, W.J. Mitchell's City of Bits) , 16has generally been left behind in favour of the idea that the urban public sphere has been doubled by a placelessdigital \"public sphere\" or has simply been extended. 17The most sophisticated version of this idea of doubling or augmenting urban public culture wasAppadurai's introduction of a series of non-spatial landscapes: ethnoscapes,mediascapes, technoscapes, nancescapes and ideoscapes: These landscapes thus are the building blocks of what ... I would like to call imagined worlds, that is, the multiple worlds that are constituted by the histor-ically situated imaginations of persons and groups spread around the globe. Animportant fact of the world we live in today is that many persons on the globelive in such imagined worlds (and not just in imagined communities) and thusare able to contest and sometimes even subvert the imagined worlds of the offi-cial mind and of the entrepreneurial mentality that surround them. 18 All these non-spatial landscapes are overlapping and interfering with each other, but, more importantly, they are penetrating and interfering with the spatiallandscape of urban culture and its public sphere. This is most prominent andalso most disruptive in the case of the interrelatedness of mediascapes and ideoscapes. Ideoscapes are typied by Appadurai as concatenations of often political images that have to do with the ideologies (and counter-ideologies) of states andmore especially with elements of the Enlightenment worldview, which \"consistof a chain of ideas, terms, and images, including freedom, welfare, rights, sover-eignty, representation, and the master term democracy\". 19Mediascapes are image-centred, narrative-based accounts of reality which offer a series of ele-ments like characters, plots, textual forms, out of which scripts can be formed of26 mediacityimagined lives, their own as well as those of others living in other places. In short, mediascapes refer to the predominantly (but not completely) non-politicalimagery of electronic media like television, video, cinema, games and Internetwhich operates largely on a transnational or global level, addressing a globalaudience (consisting of many different publics) and communicating a new global(but not necessarily cosmopolitan) imaginary world. It is important to note thatAppadurai distinguishes imagination from fantasy: the imaginary world createdby the mediascape is a construction of images related to real-life trajectories andeveryday practices of individuals and groups of people and to their hopes, fearsand desires. In this sense he distances his concept of imagination and the imagi-nary from notions of alienation, false consciousness or illusion that neo-Marxistphilosophers of the Frankfurt School like Horkheimer and Adorno attributed tothe imaginary world created by what they called the \"culture industry\". Moreimportantly, with his distinction between ideoscapes and mediascapes Appadu-rai pushes the possible disruptive effects of the mediascapes on the modusoperandi of ideoscapes to the centre of our attention. First of all the ideologicalmaster narrative of Enlightenment and democracy itself had already lost muchof its internal coherence due to what Appadurai calls the diaspora of its keyterms since the nineteenth century. But at the same time ideoscapes are stilllargely directed at local and national audiences and predominantly interested instrengthening the imaginary worlds of nation-states and national identities,whereas mediascapes are to an increasing extent oriented at global or transna-tional audiences. They address these audiences with an imagery in which politi-cal narratives are, to say the least, marginal or tend to be marginalized by thepredominance of personalizing, individualizing narratives and by the dominantidentity of the audience as a collective of clients instead of citizens. Seen from thisperspective the deeply disruptive effects of mediascapes on national public lifearen't surprising at all. Someone who pointed at this as the essence of what wenow call transnational culture, is the Latin-American anthropologist Nestor Garc\u00eda Canclini, who, reflecting on the uncertain future of the weak nation-states of Latin-America in the 1980s and 1990s, wrote: Men and women increasingly feel that many of the questions proper to citizen- ship - where do I belong, what rights accrue to me, how can I get information,who represents my interests? - are being answered in the private realm of com-modity consumption and the mass media more than in the abstract rules ofdemocracy or collective participation in public spaces. 20 And then there is the question of control, reliability and transparency of the communicated images and narratives, a question that seemed relatively sur-veyable under the limited scope of national conditions, but has now developed27 Ren\u00e9 Boomkensinto a global plethora of competing, overlapping and fast-changing media. Appadurai: What this means is that many audiences around the world experience the media themselves as a complicated and interconnected repertoire of print, cel-luloid, electronic screens, and billboards. The lines between the realistic andthe fictional landscapes they see are blurred, so that the farther away theseaudiences are from the direct experiences of metropolitan life, the more likelythey are to construct imagined worlds that are chimerical, aesthetic, even fan-tastic objects, particularly if assessed by the criteria of some other perspective,some other imagined world. 21 What Appadurai shows are possibilities, possible outcomes of the disjunctive force of several non-spatial landscapes, especially that of mediascapes, on \"the direct experiences of metropolitan life\". This means that he avoids the abstractopposition of a space of flows (the combined world of non-spatial landscapes) and a space of places (the world of local everyday experience) Manuel Castellsevoked in his seminal trilogy The Information Age. According to Castells, indus- trial society has made way for a new, informational society, based on the powergenerated by flows of information, capital, technology, sounds and symbols(comparable with Appadurai's non-spatial landscapes), and these flows are con-nected, regulated and to a certain extent controlled by global networks (oforganizations, companies and entrepreneurs) that obtained a growing domi-nance on a global scale to the extent that it is possible to claim that we live in anew kind of society: the Network Society. This network \"breaks up spatial pat-terns of behaviour into a fluid network of exchanges that underlies the emer-gence of a new kind of space of flows\". 22In The Power of Identity (volume 2 of The Information Age), these \"spatial patterns of behaviour\" are described as themain source of human identication, i.e. as \"the space of places\" in and throughwhich people give meaning to themselves, the others, and the world in whichthey live. Without identity people do not exist, but the fact that they derive theiridentities from their place-bound activities and exchanges with others, dimin-ishes the \"power of identity\" in a world that is increasingly dominated by the\"space of flows\". Cities, as the locales of modernity par excellence, are now the nodes and hubs of the Network Society; they link up the informational net-works. \"It is this distinctive feature of being globally connected and locally dis-connected, physically and socially, that makes megacities a new urban form.\" 23 What Castells shows is that the growing power of global networks of infor- mation, technology and nance has widened the gap between those activitiesthat are part of the world of global connectedness and those that are not. But hewidens this gap even more, and unconvincingly so, by claiming that there exists28 mediacityan almost ontological gap between activities belonging to the space of flows, which seem to produce power and wealth but no identity, and activities belong-ing to the space of places, which produce identity, but no real power or wealth.Exactly because the space of flows tends to connect cities globally and disconnectthem locally, as Castells holds, it plays a crucial role in the way people constructtheir identities and live their \"local lives\", while at the same time \"feeding\" thespace of flows with information, knowledge and all kinds of localized and dislo-cated narratives. Of course, Castells is right when he signals the growing powerof footloose, globally networked organizations and companies; he is also rightwhen he signals the growing obsoleteness of certain historically specic identities that are related to territorial claims. A specic type of nationalism seems to have become outdated. But that does not mean that nationalism as such has lost itsattractiveness altogether. Castells shapes a social ontology that comes close toHabermas' distinction between \"system\" and \"lifeworld\", in which the systemstands for \"money and power\", or for \"strategic rationality\", while the life-world appears as the safe house of \"communicative rationality\", the good oldworld of morals and authenticity. Likewise anthropologist Marc Aug\u00e9 con-structed an absolute opposition between the (authentic) world of places and thesupermodern world of non-places, the alien places of airports, malls and busi-ness areas, where narrativity (as the source of identity) can not take hold. 24All these abstract oppositions between power and identity, in fact, mask the realproblem: the problem that the space of flows is a serious producer of (new) iden-tities and that the space of places is not colonized by the space of flows (or forthat matter by Habermas' \"system\"), but that it is doubled, augmented,hybridized and differentiated by that same space of flows. If it is true that thisprocess went together with a growing gap between \"globals\" and \"locals\" (and Ithink there is enough evidence to support this claim), then the problem is not tooppose or ght the space of flows, but to study the consequences of these \"dou-bling\" or \"differentiating\" processes on the urban public sphere and to enlargethe power of the \"locals\" to control or influence the space of flows. Ash Amin and Nigel Thrift have made a serious effort to overcome the abstract ontological opposition between flows and places, by showing that it, infact, repeats the age-old sociological division between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft. Instead of constantly deploring the loss of community, or in thecase of Castells, of local identity, we should study the way by which urban com-munities adapt to the constant process of disruption, change and transformationof the conditions of their way of living, their whole way of life: We argue that all kinds of communal bonds still exist in cities. Some of these are still localized. What few studies there are, for example, ... suggest that in quite unlikely urban settings, all kinds of localized associations still continue to29 Ren\u00e9 Boomkensthrive. But many other communal bonds are no longer localized: they success- fully persist at a distance, posing new tests of reciprocal resolution and com-mitment, constructing new forms of intentionality, building new types of pres-ence. Once we move away from notions of face-to-face or heavily localizedinteractions as the only kind of authority, these communal bonds are not diffi-cult to see. 25 Amin and Thrift succeed in distinguishing six different types of urban communi- ties: the rst is the planned community: urban life has become more planned than before by various technologies, from maps and postcodes to licence plates,GIS or GPS, and by surveys, polls and focus groups - leading to what Deleuzecalled the \"modulated society\". A second form is the post-social and post- human community, existing in the activities of software and other technological entities. Non-human objects now act with humans in ways which are not subor-dinate and which challenge accepted notions of reciprocity and solidarity. Thethird form of community consists in the growth of new forms of human social- ity, like \"light communities\", groups that come together briefly around a partic-ular purpose and then disperse again, for instance, via the so-called \"socialmedia\" on the Internet; or little groups of \"enthusiasts\", \"fans\", groups basedon mutual sentiment and emotional feeling, informal and joined out of choice.Then there are diasporic communities (see also Appadurai), where the belonging and identication are anything but local. Here \"'home is no longer one place, itis locations'\". 26Some of these locations are sites around the world, but others are relationships and imaginaries of a different kind, which also contribute tocommunity. Furthermore there is the community at-a-distance of modern forms of sympathy for others, the mediatized sympathy at times of disasters, mobiliz- ing support for all kinds of charitable causes. And, nally, there is the community of everyday life itself. Without any refer- ence to totalizing or unifying metaphors of community life as opposed to a liquid modernity (Bauman), the community of everyday life can be dened as \"'what is left over' after all superior, specialized, structured activities have been singled outby analysis\" 27, and that is a lot. Everyday life, Amin and Thrift claim, must be de- ned as a totality, or, to use the terms I earlier introduced, as a whole way of life: Everyday life is profoundly related to all activities, and encompasses them with all their differences and conflicts; it is their meeting ground, their bond, theircommon ground. And it is in everyday life that the sum total of relations whichmake the human - and every human being - a whole takes it shape and form. Init are expressed and fulfilled those relations which bring into play the totality ofthe real, albeit in a certain manner which is always partial and incomplete:friendship, comradeship, love, the need to communicate, play, etc. 2830 mediacityWhat Amin and Thrift want to make clear is that the everyday as a whole way of lifeunder modern, and more drastically so under supermodern conditions, al - ways remains a \"left-over\", something \"in-between\" the realities of the space of flows, of the many specialized activities people are engaged in, something thatcomes \"after the events\", or only exists as a kind of \"virtual communality, one inwhich terms like 'far', 'deep' and 'distant' are replaced by rhythms which foldtime and space in all kinds of untoward localizations and intricate mixtures\". 29 This means that the urban everyday must be seen as a boundary concept, assomething that is better described by what it is not than by what it is, as DieterDe Clercq puts it in his study of Lefebvre and De Certeau. 30Whereas Henri Lefebvre (and the situationists) explicitly thought of his own theoretical work onurban culture as a contribution to a possible transformation of the urban every-day, or to a revaluation of the role and importance of the everyday, there DeCerteau attempted to valorize the apparently insignicant or trivial practices ofthe urban everyday and to make the invisible visible. De Clercq is right when hecriticizes the implicit romantic inclinations of this attitude, or the risk of identify-ing the everyday with the margins, the deviant and the experimental. By lookingfor the margins or the spectacular in the urban public sphere, the broader per-spective on the normal everyday use and experiences of urban space in generaland more specically of new urban public places, technologies and practices, iseasily lost. This broader perspective can only be found by taking the urbaneveryday as a whole way of life, which means that it is no longer possible to use itin easy oppositions between system and life world, or between the space of flowsand the space of places. The urban everyday has become the theatre where allsorts of flows meet and connect - some of them creating new opportunities, newpublic practices or new uses of the urban public domain; others foreclose suchpractices and uses. That is the reason why we need the concept of the urbaneveryday as a whole way of life and can use that concept as a boundary conceptand a strategic notion. Not by highlighting the marginal or deviant urban experi-ences, but by focusing on the banal or even normal uses of the city, are we able todevelop a (self-)critical and also pragmatic perspective on the urban publicsphere and on the opportunities and threats of new technologies and media thattime and again are transforming urban culture. In defence of urbanity as a normal way of life I once introduced the notion of a threshold world as a metaphor for modern city life and for the relatively open character of the urban community. Living in thecity means constantly standing on the threshold between public and private. Themetaphor can also be applied to the historical continuity of everyday urban cul-ture: it is a discontinuous continuity in the sense that everyday urban culture is31 Ren\u00e9 Boomkensthe stage where ever new discontinuities operate, are put to the test and nally integrated in the continuous flow of the everyday. This implies that normal livesin the city are accustomed to the abnormal, to the deviant, to otherness. But asJane Jacobs stressed, the continuity of urban culture is based on its power todomesticate deviance, change and strangeness, and that power is based on the vitality of \"the everyday\" - or as Jacobs called it, on the \"eyes and ears of thestreet\". 31Where dwelling turns its back to the street, urban public life dies out. That was one of the most damaging results of the modern movement in architec-ture and urbanism: to separate dwelling and street life. But we are now lookingfor the most important discontinuities that are operating in the continuity ofurban everyday culture at this moment. Some of them are already discussed, butI summarize them now. There are, I think, four major discontinuities that mayrepresent either a threat or a new opportunity for urban culture and the publicsphere: the rst is the denationalization of culture, or the growing influence of a global or transnational popular and commercial culture. This must above all beseen as an opportunity, indeed, because it enhances a global distribution andexchange of cultural information, experiences and values, while at the same timediminishing narrow-minded nationalism. But there are threats too: the fear of a\"global take-over\" of local urban culture is not completely unjustied. This maybe a fear of a \"McDonaldization\" of culture, or a fear of losing control over localcultural practices, i.e. a fear of loss of identity, combined with the suspicion of apowerless nation-state. Delocalization is discontinuity number two. The non-places of Marc Aug\u00e9 refer to this process, as does Koolhaas' generic city. In fact, this process started in the 1930s with the rise of the International Style in architecture, and is exempli-ed nowadays in the global distribution of the newest urban hotspots in ratheridentical outts: airports, malls, business districts, high-rise hotels, companyheadquarters, highways and train stations. We don't have to share the romanti-cism Aug\u00e9 expresses when referring to the traditional urban landscape as a land-scape of places fuelled by narration, to agree with him that these new spaces oftransport and mobility and of organized leisure are in some cases radically dis-continuous with the existing urban landscape, and more importantly, sometimesrisk to remain discontinuous with it. They especially represent a permanent dis-continuity in the new megacities in Asia and Africa, where the urban everyday islocked out of these spatial symbols of the space of flows and the cosmopolitanurban elites. The third discontinuity is represented by migration. Present-day migration is a more or less permanent process, affecting urban culture all over the world.Migration is neither a threat nor a specic opportunity for urban culture, simplybecause modern urban life has always been based on migration. Migration itselfis an attempt by people to look for new opportunities and chances in life. Yet32 mediacitythere are two threats, the most serious being the slummication of third world megacities, which can be seen as a negative form of migration. One could saythat \"normal\" urbanization is based on the positive pull of the employment, theadventure or the wealth cities have to offer. Slums are based on a negative push:people don't migrate to Jakarta or Lagos because chances of employment arehigher, they just leave the countryside because of starvation and deep poverty.The second threat consists in what Mike Davis called the ecology of fear, the media-directed imagery of cities and urban districts that are taken over bystrangers, aliens, criminals and illegal migrants. 32What Davis describes is, in fact, one of the effects of the growing prominence of mediascapes and their delo-calized or deterritorialized imagery in the \"imagined communities\" of urbanpublic space. Combined with growing tendencies towards social and ethnic seg-regation, this ecology of fear might form the greatest threat for the continuity ofeveryday urban culture and public life. Finally, there is the discontinuity of digitalization, or the stormy rise and development of new media of information and communication. Here the effectson the urban public sphere will probably be the most comprehensive and lasting- effecting indeed the whole way of life of urban culture. The opportunities areclear: post-Fordist, service-oriented economies have become completely depend-ent on the deterritorializing power of digital media, or on the time-space-com- pression they facilitate. But next to deterritorialization new media can also func- tion as instruments of reterritorialization, as applications that can help peoplearound in their own spatial reality, organizing their social life, write and distrib-ute their own stories, rants or prejudices on \"the Net\", et cetera. Here the dou- bling of urban reality takes on a rather complete, and sometimes overcomplete form. There are threats also, surely. The \"real\" urban public sphere, althoughalways supported by several media (newspapers, magazines, billboards, radio ortelevision), is in terms of experience based on embodiment. The public sphere is not so much a specic place; it consists of practices and media which to a certainextent are related to specic places. Their quintessence is not their being local-ized, but their being embodied: as practices of freedom, confrontation or identityconstruction, public practices are essentially embodied, physical, sensual andsensory practices and experiences; they presuppose bodily presence, or the expe-rience of physical differences, and a simultaneous presence of all our senses.Sometimes the new media come rather close to forms of embodied experience,but, in fact, they are essentially disembodied, virtual. Two problems appear here: rst the blurring of relevant demarcations between the embodied worlds of pri-vate and public life, with the possible consequence of the loss of a sensitivity forwhat is worthwhile in public or private life. And then there is the problem of theinnite character of the most important new medium: the Internet. Its innitycondemns 99% of the messages it contains and distributes to immediate and33 Ren\u00e9 Boomkensdenitive meaninglessness. This might affect the relevance of the \"real\" (i.e. spa- tially limited) public sphere in an indirect way. But the Internet and many digitaldevices have also proven to be a facilitating force in creating or maintaining allkinds of communal life and exchanges without interference by ofcial authori-ties or commercial companies. There is only one way to determine how these four discontinuities have affected and will affect the urban public sphere that we take to be the core of ourmodern, democratic culture and society for more than a century now. That is toconcentrate all our attention on the constantly disturbed continuity of the nor-mality of everyday urban culture, seen as a whole way of life. That calls for aninterdisciplinary and transcending rearrangement of the mono-disciplinary per-spectives on the urban reality, by urban sociologists, economists, geographers,architects or urbanists. They neglected the \"urban unconscious\" (the everyday)for more than a century now, and they should be replaced or supplemented by aself-critical anthropology of the urban everyday, with a keen sensibility for nor-mal urban life, for the banal and trivial details of its continuity, a feel for whatdoes not count. But this is surely not enough. Narrating the details of the hum-drum of everyday urban culture easily falls prey to that same humdrum. Itshould be combined with a historical phenomenology of urban culture, a historyof the present of urban culture and public life, representing a critical memory ofpast ghts, victories and defeats that affected urban public life. Here science isonly a minor force. What is needed here is the combined force of artists, journal-ists and philosophers. Artists have proven to be one of the most important forcesin putting \"the urban everyday\" in all its normality on the public agenda. Theyno longer follow the avant-gardist agendas of surrealism or situationism andtheir romanticizing of deviance and otherness, but operate as a sort of \"creativedevelopers of the everyday\" in several cities. 33Journalists represent and manage what we could call the archive of the everyday as an archive of the topical, the here and now. Without them the public sphere would have no memory of its ownpractices and experiences. Finally, the philosopher, as historical phenomenolo-gist of urban culture, has to play the role of a self-critical urbanite or citizen,looking back at two centuries of modern urban experience, using the narrativesof anthropologists and journalists to create a historical ontology of everydayurban culture as a whole way of life. Artists, anthropologists and philosopherscannot produce relevant stories about the discontinuous continuity of the urbanpublic sphere without relevant information produced by the \"old\" mono-disci-plinary sciences of economy, sociology or psychology, but they distinguish them-selves from these disciplines clearly by developing a non-reductionist perspectiveon urban culture, without false claims on universal validity - a perspective onurban culture as a whole way of life. And more importantly: explicitly norma-tive, in defence of its normality.34 mediacityNotes 1. Georg Simmel, \"The Metropolis and Mental Life\", in Classic Essays on the Culture of Cities, ed.

Some important and influential examples in the Netherlands are the many urban artistic projects of Jeanne van Heeswijk (Jeanneworks), the Hotel Transvaal project in The Hague,or the artistic and/or activist \"breeding places\" in, for instance, the north of Amsterdam orin Belgium (including artistic urban activism of groups like City Mine(d) in Brussels), butthey can be found all over the world.36 mediacityChapter Two Orkontros: Brazilian Migrants, Social NetworkSites and the European City Martijn Oosterbaan The boom in transportation and communication technology initiated in the last century has drastically changed the social and spatial geography of most Euro-pean cities. Much in line with the work of Saskia Sassen, 1Manuel Castells describes the new \"informational city\" as the \"urban expression of the wholematrix of determination of the Informational Society, as the Industrial City wasthe spatial expression of the Industrial Society\". 2Cities can be seen as hubs in the global network of people, information and goods, and - depending on their cen-trality in networks of nance, labour, production and information - such a posi-tion in the network can have quite some consequences. While not all cities are affected equally, most cities have witnessed a sustained influence of electronic/digital communication in all domains of social life. Ques-tions relating to urban networks and electronic communication - particularlythe Internet - are tightly related to several other important discussions aboutpublic life in post-industrial cities, such as, for example, the discussions aboutthe status and future of the multicultural city (partly the consequence of migra-tion patterns) or the debates about civil-political participation in the face ofdenationalization 3and transnationalization.4Electronic communication increas- ingly challenges the t between territory and political community, or as WilliamJ. Mitchell put it between the civitas and urbs. 5\"As a result, traditional congruen- cies of citizenship, public space and spectacle - long vital in the functioning ofcities - have been dislocated.\" 6 This essay aims to elucidate the links between new media, the city and the public sphere, through the lens of the online and offline practices of Brazilianmigrants in Amsterdam and Barcelona. In particular, I discuss their use of thesocial network site (SNS) Orkut ,powered by Google. I argue that Orkut pro-37vides a virtual meeting place for Brazilian migrants in and beyond the cities of residence, thus providing new avenues for social interaction, political conversa-tion and religious exchange. While such transnational avenues seeminglyendorse homophilious networking and a tribalization of the public sphere, closerinspection of the everyday lives of the people involved shows that Brazilianmigrants engage with socio-political issues of the different societies of whichthey are part in diverse ways. It is thus argued that in order to grasp opinionexchange in the age of delocalization, migration and digitalization we shouldtake as point of departure a decentred model of the public sphere rather than amodel of the public sphere that collapses citizenship and socio-political engage-ment within the framework of one nation-state. Brazilians in Europe The number of Latin Americans who have come to work and live in Europe hasincreased signicantly in the past decade. 7Popular European destinations among Brazilian migrants are: London, Amsterdam, Lisbon, Madrid, Barcelona,Rome and Paris. In 2012 it was estimated that there were about 19,000 people ofBrazilian origin living in the Netherlands. 8Research of the Amsterdam bureau of statistics shows that there had been an increase of 67% of migrants from LatinAmerica in Amsterdam between 1992 and 2006 9and Brazilians were specically mentioned as a group that had grown much.10In that period, the amount of reg- istered Brazilian migrants living in Amsterdam increased from 1,489 to 1,843, anincrease of 23.77%. This growth continued in the years thereafter. Between2008 and 2012, the amount of registered Brazilian residents in Amsterdam grewfrom 2,124 to 2,811. 11 Meanwhile, the municipal department of statistics of Barcelona counted about 9,000 registered Brazilians in the city in the beginning of 2008 againstnearly 2,000 in 2002. Besides a signicant growth of the group of registeredBrazilians, the group also grew in relative comparison with other groups of for-eigners. Whereas in 2002, Brazilians comprised 1.7% of all foreigners, in 2008this was 3.2%. In fact, statistics demonstrate that Brazilians were the fastest-growing group of foreigners in Barcelona between 2001 and 2008. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the growth of Brazilian migrants in Europe can be related to the increasing restrictions to en-ter the United States, especially after September 11, 2001 and to the pre-existentcommunities of Brazilian migrants in the European cities. Existing networks facil-itate the migration process as migrants nd work and residence via friends, ac-quaintances and relatives. 12This concurs with my general ndings. Many, though certainly not all Brazilians in Amsterdam and Barcelona, initially travelled to acity where relatives or friends had already established a livelihood. 13Likewise,38 orkontrosthe work of Beatriz Padilla14conrms the importance of social networks in the flow and patterns of contemporary migration from Brazil to Portugal. To the relative growth of documented Brazilians in Europe should be added the plausible growth of undocumented Brazilian migrants. Such an increase is likely if one takes into account the increase of attempted \"illegal\" entries into theEuropean Union, the discussions in Brazilian and European media and theamount of undocumented Brazilians I met in Amsterdam and Barcelona. 15 Brazilian citizens are generally allowed to enter the European Union on a touristvisa, yet more and more European countries demand Brazilians to demonstrateupon arrival that they have a return ticket, a place of residence at their destina-tion and enough money to sustain themselves for the period of their stay. Suchdemands are connected to the concerns of European Union members that toomany undocumented people remain within the Schengen-associated countries.The Schengen Agreement (1985) and the Treaty of Amsterdam (1997) have ledto a reduction or abolishment of border checks within the Schengen territory andthus have increased the mobility of citizens of the Schengen-associated countries,yet the treaties have also led to a strengthening of outer border checks. 16 The Internet and Politics The growth of the World Wide Web has encouraged media experts, philosophersand social scientists to revisit familiar themes in the debates concerning politicsand mass media. Most, if not all scholars agree that in a time of increasing priva-tization of broadcast, satellite and cable channels, the Internet offers practition-ers opportunities and challenges for politics in a \"postnational constellation\". 17 While some scholars are pessimistic about the idea that the Internet is equally orbetter apt to channel political movements and \"voices\" than so called \"oldermedia\", the current transnational diachronic many-to-many methods of com-munication urge us to monitor and evaluate political practices on the Internetrather than dismissing them as trivial or marvel at them beforehand. 18 Current discussions about the democratic potentials of the Internet are related to what is commonly described as the transition to Web 2.0 - not in theleast the burgeoning of SNSs such as Facebook. 19These and other popular Web 2.0 applications such as Flickr and YouTube largely consist of user-generatedcontent and are therefore also often portrayed as the quintessential examples ofwhat Jenkins has called \"participatory culture\". 20More than a technological revolution to include user content in an expanding medium, participatory cul-ture heralds new relations between producers and consumers and new mergersbetween top-down and bottom-up flows of information and control, potentiallychallenging existing hegemonic constellations. Foreshadowed by Howard Rheingold's early discussions of so-called virtual39 Martijn Oosterbaancommunities21and Michael Hauben's notion of the netizen,22contemporary online communication and online group formation23reveal that social and polit- ical scientists have to add to their common notions of face-to-face and \"imag- ined\" communities24a whole range of cybercommunities that are often fluid and performatively constituted. Negating the pessimistic view that such cybercom-munities are devoid of any \"real\" contact and thus poor substitutes of richoffline social networks, research shows that online social networks can be expe-rienced as rich and warm and that online communication generally strengthensand expands existing social networks. 25 Strongly related to the discussions about the quality of the online communica- tion is the controversy over the political implications of the growing accessibilityand use of the Internet. Although here as well people have expressed their fearthat the Internet will diminish civic-political engagement, even a sober politicalscientist such as Robert Putnam stated that Internet communication harboursthe potential for civic revitalization. 26Indeed, the work of James Katz, Ronald Rice and Philip Aspden suggests that Internet users in the United States weremore likely to engage in political activity than non-users. 27Nevertheless, Putnam rightly asks to what extent the proliferation of online communities leads to whatVan Alstyne and Brynjolfsson 28have coined cyberbalkanization; the intensica- tion of single issue or single topic communities that have little to no relation withone another and which (therefore) do not (or in lesser degrees) confront the par-ticipants of such communities with the heterogeneity of social life. 29 Whereas social network sites offer participants a relatively heterogeneous social arena where one can engage with strangers who are interested in othertopics, SNS researcher Danah Boyd warns us that with regard to the Internet,\"the dominant networked publics have shifted from being topically organized tobeing structured around personal networks\" and that SNSs are \"the personal network people's networks are homophilious, accord-ing to Boyd, SNSs are often better regarded as \"echo chambers\" than as socialdomains where politically active and politically disinterested people meet. 30In other words, as promising as the Internet may seem, cyberbalkanization andhomophilious networking challenge overly optimistic ideas about civic engage-ment. The Internet, the Diaspora and the Multicultural City Debates about the condition of the multicultural society resonate with many ofthe positions described above and often involve a host of presumptions aboutsocial and cultural differences and its consequences for public life. Many of thediscussions on multicultural society in the Netherlands in fact concern questions,debates and conflicts in and about the multicultural city and many of the ques-40 orkontrostions regarding the public sphere(s) in fact involve debates about public city life. One of the fears expressed in the Netherlands is that the availability of digitalmedia allows people to remain part of the socio-cultural sphere of their countryof origin, potentially hampering civil cohesion. According to some, for example,a greater interest in websites of the (non-Dutch) ethnic group of origin correlateswith a decrease in integration (identication with Dutch society). 31 Such fears are perhaps not entirely ungrounded, yet they often presuppose a one-dimensional view of the political subject. The rise of online transnationalcommunication and contemporary modes of transport indeed makes it easier fortransnational migrants to engage in \"homeland politics\", as Steven Vertovecputs it. 32It is much easier to remain part of what Arjun Appadurai described as a diasporic public sphere.33However, it is wrong to assume that participation in homeland politics necessarily obstructs relations and commitments to the coun-try, city or neighbourhood of residence. 34 To circumvent an approach that implicitly harbours the conclusion that cyberbalkanization is happening, we should take as a point of departure a decen-tred model of the public sphere, which according to Seyla Benhabib, is formed by the interlocking of multiple forms of associations and organizations, through the interaction of which an anonymous public conversation results. The decen-tered public sphere consists of mutually overlapping networks and associationsof opinion forming as well as decisional bodies. Within these multiple overlap-ping networks of publicity, different logics of reason giving, greeting, story-telling, and embedded speech can flourish. 35 To research how such overlapping networks function we need to examine rather than presuppose national, religious and ethnic boundaries, much in line with Gerd Baumann's study in London36or Arnold Reijndorp's study of Dutch city neighbourhoods.37Furthermore, we should recognize that social life is in- creasingly shaped by rhizomatic online and offline connections38which deserve careful examination to see what kind of civic engagement is possible and in facttaking place. Following Ren\u00e9 Boomkens, besides focusing on the discontinuitiespropelled by delocalization, migration and digitalization, we should also payclose attention to the continuities and the \"normality of everyday urban culture,seen as a whole way of life\". 39 In order to nd out how and where Brazilian migrants circulate in Amsterdam and Barcelona I started on- and offline eld research. In both cities I visited pop-ular offline gathering places such as churches, Brazilian bars and migrant organ-izations and I searched for online places via hyperlinks and search engines. Afternding the most popular online and offline gathering places I contacted andinterviewed several of their representatives and/or members and asked them41 Martijn Oosterbaanabout possible other places. Such an approach helped to circumvent the possibil- ity of missing important gathering places because of unconnected migrant net-works. As my research among Brazilian migrants showed, Brazilian migrants in the Netherlands and in Spain gather in different kinds of associations and partici-pate in different virtual communities on Orkut to discuss all kinds of matters,including Brazilian and Dutch government policies. They go online to exchange information about the best Brazilian products available in the city, to offer theirservices for those interested and to participate in a number of fan-communitiesor religious groups. Such participation is not necessarily always related to theirspecic location and neither is it completely detached from it. Since Orkut is notknown outside the group of Brazilians, the virtual meeting places remain to acertain extent reserved for them. On the other hand, the discussions that takeplace among Brazilians in the different countries do not merely reflect \"Brazil-ian\" issues but involve concerns about the different societies in which themigrants participate. Before I will say a bit more about the kind of virtual meet-ing places that exist, I will rst sketch the life of Brazilian migrants in Amsterdamand Barcelona. Offline Networks and Gatherings in the City In Amsterdam and Barcelona I found different places where Brazilian migrantsregularly gather. Both cities harbour organizations especially for Brazilianmigrants (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Amigos do Brasil). According to the president of the Ami-gos do Brasil in Barcelona, the association had 200 members in 2008, yet thepresident confessed that not many of the members attended the events of theassociation besides in the period before and during carnival. The Amigos doBrasil in Amsterdam received subsidy from the municipal government in 2006but hardly attracted migrants on a regular basis nor had any lasting membership.In both cities I encountered quite a number of Christian churches. Amsterdamhas a Roman Catholic parish which holds its services in Portuguese and whichattracts both Portuguese and Brazilian migrants. Originally the church commu-nity consisted mostly of migrants from Portugal but according to a sister whoworks at the parish there has been an increase in Brazilians since the turn of thecentury. In 2008 approximately one-third of the roughly 300 congregants wereBrazilians. Besides the Roman Catholic parish there are ve popular Brazilianevangelical churches four, of which attract around 40 to 60 people per week.One popular evangelical church receives between 200 and 300 Brazilian congre-gants per week and had 150 registered members in 2008. According to the pas-tor, around half of the congregants reside in the Netherlands without the appro-priate documents. In at least two of the other evangelical churches the majority42 orkontroslacked documents. While most of the attendants of the evangelical churches were Brazilians, I also encountered Dutch, Portuguese and Portuguese-speakingAfricans in the churches. In Barcelona there is also a Roman Catholic parish which attracts a group of about 30 to 40 Brazilians on a weekly basis and there are (at least) two evangeli-cal churches that hold their services in Portuguese. I regularly participated in oneof them, which attracted about 60 Brazilian migrants per week. In both citieschurches should be seen as important gathering places were people vent and dis-cuss issues concerning the hardships of migration and settlement. 40Neverthe- less, besides participation in church life, there are also many Brazilians who regularly make music or play football together. In Amsterdam there are at least ve capoeira 41groups, which attract besides Brazilians an international crowd of participants. Of the approximate 150 Brazilians I talked to during the research, roughly 50 were in possession of documents. According to an estimate of the Brazilianembassy in the Netherlands, there are about 3,300 irregular Brazilian migrantsresiding in the country, but this was admitted to be a very conservative estima-tion. An article of the wereldomroep 42claims that there are about 7,000 undocu- mented Brazilians residing in the Netherlands. During one church service inBarcelona the pastor asked the approximately 50 attendants how many of thempossessed documents and only one raised his hands. From the interviews I car-ried out with Brazilian migrants it became apparent that those without docu-ments come to Europe with the idea of earning enough money to return to Brazilwith the resources to buy some land, to build their own house or to begin a smallenterprise. Their idea is to stay in Europe for a couple of years, send enoughremittances to help or sustain their family in Brazil and save some money as well.Not all of them succeed in saving much nor necessarily do all of them return toBrazil. In Amsterdam many Brazilians are working in the informal sector, primarily as domestic cleaners. For example, of the approximately 70 members of one par-ticular evangelical congregation, 45 work as domestic cleaners. Most people rentrooms or a house, sometimes with other Brazilians. Cleaning work is oftenfound through satised clients. Clearly there are also many Brazilians who workin other sectors. Nevertheless, it is quite hard to nd high-wage employment inthe formal economy without the necessary papers. The men and women who donot have such papers generally have few other options than to work as cleaners,handymen or babysitters. 4343 Martijn OosterbaanOnline networks and virtual communities: Google's Orkut. Both in Amsterdam and Barcelona (and in Brazil) the social network site Orkut has become one of the main avenues for online encounters. Orkut providesBrazilian migrants a symbolic space where (versions of) Brazilian identity can bereproduced. Orkut was launched by Google in January 2004 and quicklybecame unevenly popular in Brazil. 44ComScore, a company that provides infor- mation about Internet use, has estimated that Brazil had the highest percentageof Internet users in Latin America (19.3 million) in 2008. 45In June 2007 Orkut had about 24 million unique visitors above the age of 15 from all over theworld. 46According to Orkut's own data, in September 2010, 50.60% of its users were from Brazil, followed by India with 20.44% and by the United States with17.78%. Pakistan, fourth in rank, only has a share of 0.86%. 47Due to the popu- larity of the site and to several legal issues, Google decided to hand over the con-trol of Orkut to Google Brasil in 2008 and leave the development of the socialnetwork to Google Brasil and Google India. 48 Many migrants (with or without documents) have access to a computer con- nected to the Internet and regularly use it. Orkut is one of the most popular com-munication media Brazilian migrants use to keep in touch with relatives andfriends in Brazil and in Europe. People regularly upload photos of their owntravels and adventures in the city of settlement, accompanied by comments anddescriptions. In addition, people leave each other scraps about their where-abouts and activities but most scraps simply consist of small notes that conrmthe friendships between people. In the architecture of Orkut a person's place fea-tures most prominently in his or her prole and the overview of \"my friends\" onOrkut demonstrates rows of friends with only their photo, their name and theirlocation. Many, if not all, Brazilian migrants in Europe put their city of residenceon their Orkut prole so as to demonstrate their current place of residence in theworld. Among them there are also plenty who insert different places (i.e. \"Rio deJaneiro - Amsterdam\") so as to indicate their trajectories from one place toanother. In addition to the individual links between people online, quite a number are members of one or more of the many virtual communities on Orkut. The types ofcommunities vary from supporter communities of football teams to fan commu-nities of certain idols or religious communities of specic churches and denomi-nations. While in Brazil many of these virtual communities support the forma-tion of deterritorialized associations based on identity and lifestyle rather thanlocation, the virtual communities in which migrants participate are dedicated to(life in) a certain country or a specic city, for example, Brasileiros na Holandaor Brazucas em Barcelona. These virtual migrant communities offer members the possibility of exchanging information about work, residence, products etc. in44 orkontrostheir city or country of residence and they offer avenues for the reproduction of diasporic identities and (trans)national political opinions.49 When I started the research in 2007 the community Brasileiros na Holanda had about 1,800 members. In November 2010 it had 3,176. The communityBrazucas em Barcelona had 8,600 members in September 2008 and 8,834 inNovember 2010. The application forum in particular is quite popular in theOrkut communities of Brazilian migrants. The forum allows participants to dis-cuss certain specic topics with one another over a period of time. Topics thatreceive many entries from various members are the ones that concern the situa-tion in which Brazilians nd themselves. In the community Brasileiros naHolanda much effort has been put in the categorization of certain topics that areof frequent concern. The moderator has wisely created a topic in the forumunder the title FAQ (frequently asked questions), which includes common topicssuch as \"Estudar Holandes\" (Study Dutch), \"Mandar (Send Money to Brasil), or \"Emprego\" (Work). Besides the topics that concern the practical problems and solutions of day-to-day life in the Netherlands,Brasileiros na Holanda is the place where many of the discussions concerning allaspects of everyday life are held. For example, the string of messages under thetopic \"Entre Mulheres\" (Amongst Women), which is dedicated to \"women's\"products (where to buy them in the city etc.) has been running since 2008 andhad received 1,029 messages in November 2010. The forum \" Dilma 2010\", which allowed for discussions about the programmes of candidates of the Brazil-ian elections of 2010, received 541 entries in ve months. Similar to its Dutchcounterpart, the forum of Brazucas em Barcelona offers a range of popular top-ics. Many deal with nding work and habitation in Barcelona, but there are alsoplenty of discussions about Spanish, Catalan and Brazilian politics. The topic\"Vota\u00e7ao Seria\" (Serious Voting), which was started on 14 September 2010 and received 59 entries, dealt with political elections in Brazil and Catalunya, allow-ing for opinions about both localities. Conclusions Orkut offers Brazilian migrants a social network site where they can engage withfriends and relatives in Brazil and where they can discuss issues that concernstheir \"homeland\". One could thus be tempted to view the creation of virtualcommunities on Orkut for Brazilian migrants as an example of cyberbalkaniza-tion, reproducing separate discursive arenas, enforcing the tribalization of thepublic sphere. However, such a perspective is too narrow. Brazilian migrantsengage with each other and with the societies they are part of in myriad ways.Some participate in transnational Christian church communities in their city ofresidence, others in capoeira groups or in football teams. While all attract plenty45 Martijn Oosterbaanof Brazilians, they also appeal to other people in the city. Everyday life is full of en- counters that go beyond the boundaries of supposedly separated groups. A largeportion of the Brazilians in Amsterdam work in the homes of people who wereborn and raised in the city and maintain personal relations with their employers. The virtual communities of Brazilians on Orkut do not replace or hamper everyday encounters in the city. Indeed, some of the popular virtual communitiessupport face-to-face meetings in the city. Members of the virtual migrant com-munities occasionally organize meetings in the city, which are commonly calledOrkontros, a conjunction of the words Orkut and encontro (meeting). One pastor of a popular evangelical church in Barcelona initially used Orkut to nd Brazilians who might be interested after which he could physically open hischurch near Plaza Espanya. Day-to-day online and offline practices of Brazilian migrants demonstrate that they cannot be considered a homogenous group nor should they be viewedas isolated or inward looking. What is thus sometimes portrayed as a single com-munity of Brazilian migrants is in fact a multi-layered collection of groups withconjunctures and disjunctures. Each of these groups has online mirrors, whichcontain different transnational ties. Some virtual communities primarily supportrelations with Brazilian organizations in Brazil, while others also consist of pan-European networks. Some people are very focused on Brazilian society and politics while others are also interested in the political situation of their country of residence. In general, the undocumented people I met in the evangelicalchurches did not participate actively in the virtual communities Brasileiros naHolanda and Brazucas em Barcelona. Nevertheless, most of them knew of theirexistence and were aware that it was a reliable source of information. To understand better how new media affect city life and vice versa it is not very useful to portray SNSs as leading either to civic integration and engagementor to cyberbalkanization. What we encounter is an arena of fragmented, yetinterconnected conversations that link people of particular groups to oneanother and allow for different kinds of issues that go beyond \"homeland\" con-cerns. Brazilian migrants from different social and cultural backgrounds engagewith each other in virtual communities on Orkut to share music and food tastesor to battle over who was the best Brazilian football player. Yet people also dis-cuss issues concerning the rights, regulations and politics in Brazil and in thecountry of residence. The ndings of my research thus support Benhabib's plea for a decentred model of the public sphere in which multiple forms of associations and organiza-tions are interlocked and through which an anonymous public conversationtakes place. While Brazilians in the Netherlands and Spain often would like toengage more directly with their society of residence, state regulation and controlof the entry and mobility of non-citizens remains one of the principal obstacles46 orkontrosto participation in public city life. The question remains, however: How do opin- ions formulated in overlapping networks relate to decisional bodies, especially inthe case of undocumented residents? As Nancy Fraser argues, the nation-state isin many cases no longer the sovereign power within a given national territoryand the actual publics that discuss certain societal concerns do not constitute thepolitical citizenry. 50States increasingly have to deal with non-citizens and migrants often have to deal with their exclusion from political citizenship. AsFraser puts it, \"[H]egemony increasingly operates through a post-Westphalianmodel of disaggregated sovereignty.\" 51This is not only a philosophical but also a practical problem for undocumented Brazilians in Europe.

In her work, Fraser argues that Habermas' original conception of the public sphere was implicitly based on the Westphalian state. Ac-cording to Fraser, Habermas thus assumed, amongst other things, the existence of a mod-ern state apparatus that exercised sovereign power over a bounded territory, which con-tained the political citizenry. Furthermore, publicity in Habermas' model implicitly assumeda nation-state with a national communications infrastructure contained by the very samestate. The post-Westphalian world does not display such a neat overlap between sovereignpower, national citizenry and territorial borders, not to mention the fact that political discus-sions (on transborder issues) concern dispersed audiences.50 orkontrosChapter Three Imagining the City: The Difference that Art Makes Judith Vega No matter how abstract a conception may be it always has its starting point in a perception ... [O]ught we not rather return to perception? - Bergson, Key Writings, 250 The city is, historically and presently, regarded as the centre and epitome of mod- ern life. It is in the city that the various self-images of modernity (freedom, rationality, wealth), as well as the various critiques of modernity (decadence,alienation, poverty) nd their exemplars. The city constitutes the focal point ofmany ambivalences about modern life. Still, if it is thoroughly disputed whatmodern urban life stands for, the dispute also evidences how the city is thoughtto constitute a certain way of life, to engender some or other general mode ofbeing. As Ren\u00e9 Boomkens (in this volume) puts it, the city amounts to a culturalreality of sorts, forming a \"collective framework of meaning\" that renders it a\"centre of knowledge, power, imagination, ideology and fantasy\". This \"cul-tural reality\" has, in the course of the past two centuries, elicited different sortsof discourses that frame our knowledge and experience of the city - rangingfrom technocratic to anthropological angles on urban life. In these discourses onthe city, the various arts have occupied a seminal, though variable role. 1This role has not escaped the attention of cultural philosophy. For cultural theorists in theearly twentieth century, like Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer, art wasindeed a main source of insights into (the ideology of) urban life. In their foot-steps, I will attempt to further delineate how art contributes to our knowledgeand experience of the city. The arts have been actively occupied with city culture and the city's public spaces. They have done so in ways that overlap with, but also often add to, the51more mainstream intellectual and ideological discourses on the city. Art adds to these, inter alia, by providing its proper modes of knowing urban life, which dif- fer from those provided by technology, science and academic theory. Myresearch has focused on the visual arts, a choice that ensued from the belief thatvisuality constitutes a prime dimension of living in cities and interacting in pub-lic. In studying the visual arts, we may be provided with new angles for under-standing the scopic aspects of urban relations. What images and tropes co-directand/or frustrate the encounters of urbanites in public space? From the visual arts, I have enlisted the \"older\" media, i.e. painting and cin- ema. These serve to accentuate the long-time (not just \"postmodern\"), crucialrole of various media and their vast production of urban imagery, in sustainingand mediating the experience of the city. By now, much attention is being givento the role of the new (digital) media in the organization and experience of urbanlife. This study provides a longer diachronic perspective on how media have con-gured the ways in which urban spaces are perceived and used, the types of inter-action that can belong to them, and the various \"urban identities\" that may beexperienced. 2 As also suggested by Ren\u00e9 Boomkens in this volume, the arts on the city may be likened to an \"ethnographic\" approach of the city, in their focusing on the\"urban everyday\". I have conceived of art's representations of urban life as aseries of researches into what it means to live in a modern city. By virtue of theirbeing visual arts, they allow us to literally \"see\" how relations between subjects and urban space may be embodied and what forms urban interaction mayassume. Art took on the life of the modern everyday when, from the nineteenthcentury onwards, it turned to representing the city spaces of streets, back alleys,squares, windows and balconies, as well as the positions, actions and interac-tions that together form the very substance of urban public life. It is a city as livedspace, space as experienced on a daily basis in manifold fashions. 3In developing the city as artistic subject, modern art started, more precisely, to address theeveryday as it pervasively took on public forms. The arts engaged a nineteenth-century everyday which had become a crowded urban space, a mass democracyof sorts. All kinds of strange others, but also various innovations on a broadsocial and political level, such as new technologies and novel political gover-nances, had started to invade ordinary life in unprecedented ways. These novelinvasions of the everyday made it into a hotchpotch of what formally (and con-ceptually) still passed as public and private domains. What, among other things,ensued were newly strained relations between people's experiences of the privateand the public. 4 While on the one hand the city stood out as the meeting place of the moderns, on the other hand it harboured all the social and cultural realities that compli-cated the modern ideal of progress, unication and political egalitarianism.52 imagining the cityEvolving equal political rights to the \"public sphere\" went hand in hand with class and gender hierarchies, as well as unresolved race and migration issues. Thecity could become the extension of the home to some, while remaining an inhos-pitable battleeld to others. Or, one person could probably experience both sen-sations intermittently. Understanding and handling modern urban life became apsychological, intellectual and artistic challenge. It is this - empirically and symbolically - crowded and confusing realm which gave rise to a novel, modern, art of the urban. This art explored an urban publiclife that was groping for its way among the conflicting ideals and realities ofdemocracy, and in the process tasked the body with qualms about which streetsto select, where to direct one's gaze, how to hold one's own in anonymous and/or inhospitable spaces (e.g. Gustave Caillebotte produced, between 1875 and1880, several paintings of men looking down on Boulevard Haussmann - a veri-table research into the male bourgeois gaze). This city is distinct from earliertypes of cities-as-public-spheres. It differs from, for instance, the city of antiq-uity, where the outstanding, deft orator was the heroic icon of the public space.It also differs from its immediate predecessor, the late-eighteenth-century repub-lican vision of the urban, with its symbolically promoted, laudable actionsexpressed by classic city metaphors. A vision that received its most famous artis-tic statement in Jacques-Louis David's Oath of the Horatii (1784) (see gure 1), exemplifying a (thoroughly gendered) contemporary reception of the values ofthe ancient polis and its loyal citizens. In contrast, the modern art-of-the-urbanwent empirical, to try a word, which does qualify for suggesting this art's prox-imity to the simultaneously evolving social sciences. For we may say that this artstudies city space as the ground, and testing ground, of the confusions that arisefrom the modern city as meeting place of - potentially - everyone. 5 Art, then, details the confusions of the urban meeting place. We do not see the random passings of modern urbanites that a certain ideal political theory wouldhave us see. Art rather provides us with an index of the fated encounters ofmodernity's subjects - those politically decried equals-to-be, who meanwhileseem at a loss for means to really master the contacts with their anonymous oth-ers. Mainstream public sphere theory has aspired to solve that incongruity of ourabstract political equality and our real differences through formal theories ofpublic reasoning. These contend that language - our universally shared capacity- has become the mediating device of modern publicity, capable of uniting thediversied public into a unied citizenry. 6Art, for its part, shows us the disturb- ing details of the physical encounter - with the strange others that modernity hasthrown together as well as with the overpowering urban surroundings of mod-ern life. These visual stagings are not \"mere\" aesthetic exercises: they co-pro-duce an urban imagery of public subjectivity, of bodily comportment in publicand of the meaning of public and private worlds. That these \"embodiments\" of53 Judith Vegapublic presence carry ethical implications has been insisted on by, for instance, urban sociologist and theorist Richard Sennett: \"urban spaces take form largelyfrom the ways people experience their own bodies ... [W]e have to change theunderstanding we have of our own bodies.\" 7 The pictorial and cinematographic arts that explicitly represent city life con- stitute visual conceptualizations of urban public space. In representing actual\"embodiments\" of urban subjectivity, they at once specify the differencesbetween these bodies and their dispositions towards publicity - differences thatmay refer to gender, class or ethnicity. We may say that the modern art of theurban evidences the city as a \"difference machine\", in the words of Engin Isin,which echo Jane Jacobs' conviction that big cities are \"[t]he generators of diver-sity\". An insight pointedly, pessimistically, reworded again in David Harvey'sMarxist description of the city as a generator of inequality. 8 I would argue an artistic discourse on difference in the public sphere that has been in place from at least the second half of the nineteenth century, and articu-lated mostly over and against modernity's political ction of an ideal, unied cit-izenry on egalitarian basis. Nevertheless, the artistic discourse also presumesthat very ideal, in recording an \"incomplete modernity\". The arts show us allkinds of bodies in public - citizens and proto-citizens; the rich and poor, maleand female. These form an empirical presence in public space while not necessar- ily also in the public sphere - its politically conceptualized normative variant. We may illustrate this by considering one artistic trope of the urban, which exists indepicting men reading the paper and women being occupied differently or sim-ply staring into space ( see gures 3-6) - the newspaper, of course, standing for acertain exercise of citizenship, or engagement with the public sphere. This tropeconveys how mere empirical presence in public space does not sufce as indica-tion of presence in the public sphere: whether we \"see\" presence in the publicsphere depends on a conceptualization of what counts as being-in-public. 9 Art, meanwhile, is no stranger to the range of theoretical and ideological perspec-tives on modern city life. It partakes in the discourses which set the parameters ofour understanding of modern urban culture. Let me here contrast two such cen-tral discourses, the rst exemplifying a \"grand\" urban modernity modernity of fragmentary, discon-tinuous, disconnecting, estranged, conflict-prone urban existence under the signof ever multiplying differences. The fascinations of art indeed equate those of urban theory: the city as symbol of either wealth and freedom or poverty and decadence, urban spaces giving rise to either exhilarating exploration or stupe-fying alienation. But the visual arts distinguish themselves by bringing out dimen-sions of these fascinations that academic theory mostly misses out on.54 imagining the cityThe visual arts complement urban theory and public sphere theory in repre- senting actual \"embodiments\" of urban subjectivity and interactions.10In that respect, the visual arts critically engage with the dominant concept of the public sphere as an essentially \"argumentative\", rationalist practice, premised on thepolitical ction of a unied citizenry. The specic contribution of the arts tothinking about urban culture and public sphere consists in the problematics itinterpolates in such a conceptual focus: who is where and how are they present? This does not imply that these arts necessarily constitute a \"critical\" discourse insubstantive respects. As stated above, narrative clich\u00e9s similar to those runningthrough urban theories are indeed entertained by the arts. But the different kind of stories about the public sphere that the visual arts give us, effectuate a change inthe ontological \"register\" or \"feel\" of urban experience. They orient us towardsthe public sphere as a realm of the sensory next to the discursive, a realm of physi-cal next to linguistic confrontations. It thus may be imperative to have the philosophy of the city and the art of the city \"talk to each other\", keeping with Henri Bergson's admonishment (see theepigraph to this of honouring the interplay of conceptualization and per-ception. 11It may be that the contrasts that are congured in the visual arts have to become legible through the concepts handed to us by urban theory; still, the-ory in its turn badly needs an input from \"the perceived\", or, from those \"quali-tative differences\" that conceptualizations appear to be \"forced to eliminatefrom the real\". 12 Moreover, by focusing on artistic \"urban discourses\" we add a specic angle to the discussions of art and politics as found with, for instance, Walter Ben-jamin, Carl Schorske, Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Ranci\u00e8re. 13These thinkers all offer specic views of the links between art and politics. Benjamin attended tothe relation of visual culture to capitalism and its modes of commodication,Schorske to the social discourses harboured by architecture, Deleuze to cine-matographic \"the people\" or \"the nation\", and Ranci\u00e8reto the ways in which both aesthetics and politics address the realm of \"the sensi-ble\". In turning to the arts-of-the-city, we direct that discussion specically toart's particular relation to the public sphere. To employ the formulation by Ran-ci\u00e8re, art's relation to politics lies in the way it \"distributes\" the positions andfunctions of bodies in shared space, directing us to the bodies that are to form therelevant masses or communities. Art relates to the political in its \"distribution ofthe sensible\", of \"bodily positions and movements, functions of speech, the par-celling out of the visible and the invisible\". 14I will apply a similar notion quite literally to concrete artworks. How do such bodily \"distributions\" appear in artsthat explore urban public space? What visual repertoires exist on distinct uses ofurban space and distinctions of spaces? How do modes of awarding visibilityand invisibility constitute public practices? 55 Judith VegaModern citizenship has been conceived as a political agency that is mastered and practised by means of a host of mediating devices. The focus of such concep- tualizations has been on the more directly political media like papers, televisionand the Internet, which primarily concern public opinion. To broaden that focus to cultural media like the visual arts, means to include a concern with public presence. As noted above, these latter media hinge around the question \" who is where and how are they present?\" Walter Benjamin coined the term \"optical unconscious\" for the evolving perception of one's self under the eye of a camera,which registers the seconds of one's posture that the physical eye would not. 15 That term would also be applicable to the ways in which people are in public andexperience themselves in public, the ways in which they perceive themselves aspublic beings and their surroundings in codied ways - pregured at least in partby visual media. Below I will discuss an (obviously very small) selection of examples from the history of modern visual culture. For the sake of brevity I have restricted myselfto painting. The cinematographic arts, however, are (at least) as rich a source. 16 The examples show how the visual arts have constituted a discourse on \"differ-ence\", which was sorely missed in urban theory, until (especially) feminist stud-ies started to critically address urban theories' purported either urban or general scopic con-texts). 17Gender is of course not the sole axis of urban subjectivity that has been pointed out as co-structuring public space and the public sphere. The class-rid-den character of the modern city, as well as the presence of immigrants as a spe-cial category of the city's \"strangers\", have been further irritants to the mod-ernist ideal. Art on difference in urban space: Class, gender, colour I have selected three pairs of images which in their contrasts provide us withvisual registers of the different urban presences of classes and genders, and of theproblematic of whether \"to see or not to see\" colour (in an ethnic or race sense)in urban contexts. My rst examples of such visually grasped discords are Gustave Caillebotte's Place de l'Europe. Temps de pluie (1877) and Honor\u00e9 Daumier's Dans la Rue (year unknown but probably between 1848-1860) (see gures 7 and 8). Thepaintings provide arresting interpretations of class-divided nineteenth-centurypublic space. The contrasts between them become the more striking for the com-parable layout of the pictures, the bodies placed similarly within the space of thecanvas and paper. The similarity of topic and composition wryly contrasts withthe urban experiences the images convey. We see nineteenth-century painters'56 imagining the cityversions of \"to be or not to be\", which illustrate, as already addressed above, how empirical presence far from matches symbolic presence. The bodily com-portments may be described as respectively signifying pride and self-assertion,and a certain forlorn isolation. Both images picture large city fa\u00e7ades, but thespaces depicted contrast in the respective presence and absence of architecturalgrandeur, and in the modes in which city space is experienced. Caillebotte showsa grand bourgeois space which keeps expanding through the open perspectiveoffered by a Parisian square (by its name - Temps de pluie [Rainy Day] - connot- ing someone staying at home in the openness of an equally prosperous Europe),painted in decisive, clear colours. Daumier draws a proletarian scene wherespace has shrunk, even materially in the small sepia-toned image of an alleyseemingly cut off from the rest of the world. Caillebotte's image bears out bour-geois individualism, with the wife on the arm as further suggestive of such pos-sessive individualism, whereas Daumier's rendering of the proletarian couplesuggests the contrary. The second pair of images is formed by Isaac Israels, Hoedenwinkel van Mars op de Nieuwendijk (Mars' hat shop in an Amsterdam shopping street) (1893), Caillebotte, Int\u00e9rieur. Femme \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre (1880) (see gures 6 and 9). Israels shows women in public, both upper- and lower-class women, engaging in the\"typically female\" occupation of shopping. Women here have appropriated thestreet in a tting example of a presence in their own right, couched in terms ofwhat Rita Felski has called a \"feminization of modernity\" in which \"a culture ofconsumption helped to shape new forms of subjectivity for women\". 18Caille- botte's painting, in contrast, harks back to the public-private tropes alreadymentioned above. The painting interestingly comments on the gap betweenempirical and metaphorical meanings of these tropes. It depicts a woman look-ing through the window, \"into public space\", and a man in a darker corner of theroom. While the man seems to be situated in a more private space, his readingthe newspaper stands for his being in public space, or the public sphere, whichproduces a marked distinction of gendered locations vis-\u00e0-vis publicity. A third pair of images concerns Mark Rothko, Subway (1935) and Jacob Lawrence, Subway (1938) (see gures 10 and 11). As with the rst pair, these paintings share a similar topic, and use a similar composition. Both picturesdepict a group of individuals seemingly lost in the alienating non-spaces of urbanpublic transport. 19The bodies depicted illustrate what we may call \"mismeet- ing\": the tactics or skill of avoiding the other that one is forced to meet in urbansettings, for example, by averting one's gaze. 20Still, the pictures seem to harbour an ambivalence. While Rothko's image conveys that universal urban experience,it is possible to read the second image as a commentary on such a \"general\"experience of alienation in the city. That is, it may focus on the specic alienationthat affects one marginalized social group. Somehow, the group of black people57 Judith Vegaappears to come across as more of a \"group\" than the people on the under- ground platform. Lawrence's persons seem to be lonely as a collective, not per seas separate individuals. But if one suddenly sees a social group rather than thealienated individuals in Rothko's painting, this might very well ensue from agaze entangled in ethnocentric habits of viewing. There is of course good reasonto think that Lawrence did intend to convey an image of special alienation - hepainted long series of the lives of American blacks in and after emigration to theNorth, and of their under-class status in the northern cities. But apart from theintended message, these otherwise similar images appear able to narrate differ-entexperiences of urban space. This is further suggested by Lawrence's framing of the subway scene in a window, which generates an ambivalence of the sensa-tions of private and public, or, a hint of the privatization to which this group'sexperience is subjected. Visual art, in its particular attention to sensory experience, may suggest a uni- versal experience, but it will more likely show moments of or clashes betweendistinct experiences. The pictures seem unable to escape the metaphorical statusthey receive from the larger framework of (conceptually and artistically) repre-senting cities. They indeed illustrate what Richard Sennett, following RolandBarthes, wrote about the \"image repertoires\" we use in determining our behav-iour towards strangers. 21Such visual repertoires closure the possibility of encountering the stranger on a \"na\u00efve\" footing - he or she is already enwrappedin images and stories. Together, these images show how art on the city forms a running commentary on the modernist \"Haussmannian\" ideology that tried to x urban space interms of progress, transparency, control, unication and emancipation. Thatcommentary is not (necessarily) intentional, and the singular images may evenintend something very different than such a critique. The intention they do shareis that of attending in detail to bodily and built presence in urban space. In ren-dering such \"visual descriptions\" they direct us to the very material, physicalcontents of that public space. Because visual culture occupies itself with imag- ined bodies and spaces, it gives us ever specic frames which reveal the limita-tions of the general. The conceptual frames of urban theory become experientialframes in the arts - in turn eclipsed by the force of the generally conceived. Notes 1. See Boomkens, in this volume, for a general impression of the various urban discourses that played a role in understanding and designing modern cities. 2. The study, then, elaborates on the social-philosophical tenet that the modern public sphere is, historically, a quintessentially mediated sphere; it developed, from the eighteenth centu-58 imagining the cityry onwards, around media for generating \"public opinion\". This tenet got its extensive elab- oration in J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1989 [1962]). 3. Kracauer remarked on the ways in which cinema relates to, and opens up, the everyday. Film always offers more than the particular story plot it intends to convey, providing cinema withan extra-ideological dimension. Watching the faces and streets on the screen always har-bours an excess, a fringe of unintended views, memories and associations, directing us to-wards the complexities of our everyday lives. \"Films tend to explore this texture of everydaylife, whose composition varies according to place, people, and time. So they help us not on-ly to appreciate our given material environment but to extend it in all directions. They virtual-ly make the world our home\" (Siegfried Kracauer, Theory of Film: The Redemption of Physical Reality [Princeton University Press, 1960], 304). This article assumes painting to likewise provide such a vagrant reliving of the urban every day. 4. For problematizations from a feminist perspective of the public-private divide in conceptu- al (as well as experiential) respects in the fields of social history and visual studies respec-tively, see, e.g. Mary P. Ryan, Women in Public: Between Banners and Ballots, 1825-1880 (Balti- more: John Hopkins University Press, 1992), and Johanna Drucker, Theorizing Modernism:Visual Art and the Critical Tradition (New York: Colombia University Press, 1994). 5. I use the word \"empirical\", regardless whether the artist chose a realist or symbolic style of depiction. The point may be illustrated with, for instance, George Grosz's painting Metrop -olis(1917)(see figure 2). It represents, in a symbolic visual language, a markedly dystopian view of the decadent city based in a modernist discourse on and experience of the urban, onewhich hinges around the image of the city as a whore, and women in public becoming visibleonly as whores. 6. I refer to the social-philosophical tradition based on J\u00fcrgen Habermas' theory of the modern public sphere, which argues that its political legitimation is based on certain formal aspectsof its linguistic proceedings. See Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the PublicSphere, and his The Theory of Communicative Action , 2 vols. (London: Heinemann, 1984; Cambridge: Polity Press, 1989). 7.

We may also consult Lefebvre: \"Considered overall,social practice presupposes the use of the body: the use of the hands, members and sensoryorgans, and the gestures of work as of activity unrelated to work. This is the realm of the per- ceived (the practical basis of the perception of the outside world\" (Henri Lefebvre, The Pro- duction of Space [Oxford: Blackwell, 1991 (1974)], 40). 8.

Young translated the notion that city life essentially turns on differ-ence and otherness - mostly Jacobs' - into a feminist normative social ideal (Iris Young,Justice and the Politics of Difference [Princeton University Press, 1990], ch. 8). 59 Judith Vega9.

See, e.g. Erving Goffman, Behavior in Public Places: Notes on the Organiza- tion of Gatherings (New York: The Free Press, 1963) and Lyn H.

Mullarkey (New York: Continuum, 2002), 250. Bergson explicitly names painting as the art most apt \"to see and to make us seewhat we do not naturally perceive\" (p. 251). He gives the arts, rather than conceptual philos-ophy, a prime role in getting us out of the aporia to which the primordiality of perceptionvis-\u00e0-vis conceptualization on the one hand (see the epigraph) and the insufficiency andever selective character of natural perception on the other (e.g. p. 253) seem to lead us. Thearts, and painting in particular, are uniquely capable of making \"the eyes of the body, or thoseof the mind, to see more than they see\" (251). 12. Bergson, Key Writings, 250. 13.

Sennett, Flesh and Stone, 365.61 Judith VegaChapter Four Body Movies: The City as Interface Martijn de Waal The city would not exist as a modern urban society without the urban public domain. This is the central claim of a large number of theories of urban culture.1 After all, urban life is dened by the fact that we are forced to share the city witha multitude of strangers from disparate backgrounds and with diverse identitiesand interests. For this reason it is of great importance that there are public spaceswhere we encounter these \"others\", are confronted by them and must relate tothem. In each of these theories, the urban public domain in which people negoti-ate their everyday practice, cultural identity and political ideals has a physicalcharacter: it takes place on the agora, the boulevard, the street or in the coffeehouse. However, at the beginning of the twenty-rst century digital and mobile media are beginning to play an ever-greater role in the spatial experience ofurban life and this has consequences for the manner in which the urban publicdomain functions. Indeed, I would venture that it is now questionable whetherthe concept of the urban public domain is still meaningful now that the inter-faces of digital media are beginning to play a large role in the ways in which peo-ple relate to each other in cities. It is my contention that, partly for this reason,the term interface will have to play a central role in the theory of urban culture. 2 The interactive video installation Body Movies - Relational Architecture 6 by the Mexican artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer makes clear how this works. Body Movies - Relational Architecture 6 was shown in Rotterdam in Septem- ber 2001 as part of the city's celebrations as Cultural Capital of Europe. Thework by the Mexican artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer consisted of a nocturnalshadow play generated by passers-by on the immense side wall of the Path\u00e9 cin-ema complex on the Schouwburgplein (see gures 12 and 13). In recent yearsBody Movies has come to be seen as a canonical project within the critical dis- course around digital and interactive media. In this contribution I intend to62demonstrate, partially on the basis of some of these commentaries, how Body Movies has made an important contribution to the debate about the urban pub- lic domain. In particular, the work questions the impact of digital and multime- dia technologies on urban culture. Three points are crucial in this respect. Firstly, through digital projections Body Movies provides the built environment with an interactive media layer, thus altering the experience and meaning of the location. In this way Body Movies feeds into discussions about the \"hybridization\" of urban life: the expe- rience of the city is determined not only by the physical space but also by \"urbanscreens\" and mobile media technologies. The second point builds upon the rst. If this media layer indeed plays an important role in the experience of the city, then the interface design of thismedia layer must also play an important role. What role does the interface playin social interactions among urban populations? Does an interface work prima-rily as a lter, in which the media layer ts the individual's personal preferences?Or does the interface stimulate chance encounters between strangers? In Body Movies Lozano-Hemmer developed a specic notion of interactivity, which can be of importance in the design of software interventions in urban life. This leads us to the third point. Body Movies offers a clue for a new way of looking at the urban public domain. As Ren\u00e9 Boomkens has shown elsewhere inthis volume, the urban public domain has hitherto primarily been described inspatial terms. The discussion always centres on the urban spaces in which vari-ous social processes take place. Using Body Movies as an example, I would like to shift the focus of the discussion. Due to the hybridization of urban life, inter-faces take on a crucial role. In order to understand urban culture fully, we shouldshift our focus away from the spatial forms of the urban public domain towardshow the city as a whole functions as an \"interface\". I shall elaborate these threepoints further below. But before doing so, it is important to explain the preciseworkings of Body Movies. Body Movies - the installation Rafael Lozano-Hemmer was inspired to make Body Movies by the seventeenth- century engraving The Shadow Dance by Samuel van Hoogstraten, whichdepicts actors performing a shadow play by standing in front of a light sourceplaced close to the ground. The closer they stand to the light source, the largerand more demonic their shadows appear on the backdrop. With Body MoviesLozano-Hemmer wished to provoke a similar shadow dance with twentieth-cen-tury means and in which the audience takes on a performative role: the work ofart takes form only when the public is seduced into participating in the shadowdance.63 Martijn de WaalThree centuries after Samuel van Hoogstraten's time the light source consists of two bright xenon lamps placed at ground level on the Schouwburgplein, pro- jecting a powerful beam onto the wall of the Path\u00e9 cinema complex. Simultane-ously, photographs of people walking in the streets of Rotterdam are projectedfrom a high platform. However, the light from the xenon lamps is so bright thatthe projected photographs remain invisible until someone walks in front of thelamps, revealing part of the image in his or her shadow. When passers-by realizethat they are able to \"reveal\" the photographic images with their shadows, someof them usually begin to experiment with this effect. Lozano-Hemmer has added yet another playful interactive element to the installation. If the shadows of the passers-by on the Schouwburgplein preciselymatch the outlines of the people in the projected photograph, a new image is pro-jected. A camera with image-recognition software constantly analyzes theshadow play and triggers a new projection when certain conditions are met. Inthis way passers-by are encouraged to work together to adopt positions in frontof the xenon lamps that correspond to the composition on the cinema's fa\u00e7ade.In Rotterdam in 2001 this produced a \"frequently comic and sometimes movingspectacle\", according to the Algemeen Dagblad: \"Shadows of unsuspectingpassers-by were affectionately embraced or mercilessly trampled underfoot byenormous giants. These were in fact small children who, coming close to thelight, for a moment imagined themselves to be very big and powerful.\" 3 \"Urban screen\", \"hybrid spaces\" and the urban experience Body Movies lays an interactive media layer over the Schouwburgplein, which passers-by can have an effect upon, triggering a new photograph depending onthe position they adopt. The installation turns the Schouwburgplein into a\"hybrid space\". This term was introduced by De Souza e Silva to indicate thaturban life is no longer purely dictated by the physical environment, but thatmedia layers and digital spaces now also play a part. She denes \"hybrid space\"as, \"a conceptual space created by the merging of borders between physical anddigital spaces\". 4Of importance in this respect is that the two layers - physical and virtual/digital - are actually no longer distinguishable: they flow into eachother and are, in combination, responsible for the ways in which people experi-ence a specic urban site. Body Movies is often connected with the emergence of the so-called \"urban screens\", an umbrella term for large, sometimes interactive billboards in thepublic realm. 5In one sense, \"urban screens\" t within a long tradition of inscrip- tions and images on buildings from sculptures on temples and frescos andstained-glass windows in cathedrals to the flickering neon and LED advertise-ments of Tokyo's Shibuya district or New York's Times Square. 6What is new,64 body movieshowever, is that the content of this media layer has become flexible. Frescos and stained-glass windows have been part of the buildings in question for centuriesbut the content of a digital screen or light installation is largely distinct from itsphysical support. And in some cases this media layer may be influenced by thosewho use or pass by the location. Precisely what the rise of \"urban screens\" means for the experience of the urban public domain depends, of course, on the application of the screen. Thereare \"urban screens\" around which crowds form, for example, to watch a con-cert, political event or football match. But other \"urban screens\" are related tothe commercialization of the public realm: many of these billboards are used pri-marily for advertising and address the public as consumers. The newest genera-tion of screens can even adapt the message to the audience. Cameras and a facialrecognition system analyze the age and gender of passers-by and show a com-mercial tailored to their prole. In this way digital media are enlisted to add amedia layer which attunes the environment - in marketing terms - to its users.And so the hybrid urban experience is used primarily to serve marketing andconsumption. Lozano-Hemmer employs projects such as Body Movies precisely to expose this encroaching commercialization of the public realm. He wishes to offer analternative to the negative aspects of what Ren\u00e9 Boomkens has referred to else-where in this volume as denationalization and delocalization. Boomkens usesthese terms to refer respectively to the emergence of global popular and commer-cial culture, and (often in tandem with the former) the emergence of sites whosearchitecture and function render them indistinguishable from similar sites else-where in the world, such as Starbucks and McDonald's or the design of shoppingmalls and airports. Such phenomena threaten to produce urban environmentsthat are entirely devoted to consumerism and which offer few opportunities forthe creation of a local identity. This local identity is undermined, for example, by the onslaught of billboards promoting international brands. These images are often part of global advertis-ing campaigns and thus partially strip the city of its local identity, according toLozano-Hemmer. \"Cities are saturated with images and messages but they rarelyshow diversity and do not relate on an intimate level with the public\", he claims.They evoke feelings of distance, euphoria, obedience and awe. But few of a city'sinhabitants recognize themselves in these images that dominate the cityscapebecause, Lozano-Hemmer believes, commercial billboards insert a transnationaldimension in an entirely one-sided way. 7They address a homogeneous and ideal- ized international market and as such their representations are without nuance.Of course, the shady side of these transnational references are kept out of the pic-ture, for example, that the fashionable trainers worn by a particular celebrity aremade in poor working conditions in a factory in East Asia. 865 Martijn de WaalThis sense of the loss of a local identity is amplied by the fact that the city's architecture has also broken free from the local culture. Every city has the same ofce buildings and chain stores and also has - precisely out of fear of loss ofidentity to a globalized architectural style - a number of historical buildings thatmay not be altered. These are iconic museum pieces that safeguard a historicalidentity, but this heritage approach stands in the way of an appropriation of suchbuildings that is part of the contemporary experience. With Body Movies Lozano-Hemmer wishes to combat these two interrelated tendencies. His aim is to misuse \"the technology of spectacle\" in order toawaken a sense of intimacy and engagement, for example, by temporarily givingbuildings a local signicance through his interactive installations: An important aspect of my work ... is to produce a performative context where default buildings may take on temporary specificity and where vampire build-ings' [the term he uses for specific historical monuments] role of establishedprevailing identification may decline. 9 An important source of inspiration in this respect is the ideas of the situationists. Like this group of artists around Guy Debord in the 1950s and 1960s, Lozano-Hemmer attempts to get people to look at themselves and the city around themin a new way. His aim is thus to \"liberate\" them or, in any case, to offer them analternative to the disciplining mechanisms of consumer society, to pry passers-byaway momentarily from their everyday routine and to invite them to make theirown \"readings and subtitles\" of the city. 10Lozano-Hemmer is particularly enamoured with the situationist practice of the \"virtual appointment\", in whicha person was instructed to be at a particular location at a specied time, wherethey would encounter someone with a similar task. This idea could intensify theway in which the participants experience their surroundings: Every person walking by might be about to step into your life. The slightest of gestures amplifies into an emergent sign of recognition. The space around is nolonger a neutral frame. It is charged with anticipated gazes leading to potentialapproaches. 11 Lozano-Hemmer believes that urban art interventions should have a similar character. \"To exceed the expected\" is his motto, a goal inspired by the situation-ist practices of the d\u00e9rive and the detournement . 12Body Movies is just such an example of a project that shows how the deployment of digital media can createopportunities to invest the urban public domain with new meanings. Instead ofadvertising campaigns featuring larger-than-life depictions of international starsand sports heroes, Body Movies consists of a collection of images of \"ordinary\"66 body moviespeople, photographed during their everyday urban routines or simply strolling in the city. By adding an extra layer with the help of interactive projections, thephysical reality is given a local context and identity that is normally denied bythe location's function and design. Interface design and social relations In this respect Lozano-Hemmer is concerned not only with the content of hisprojections, but also with the social interaction his project elicits. This occurs,for example, through the playful element in Body Movies that encourages people to work together temporarily to make the system switch to the next image. Thisleads us to a second aspect of the manner in which the project intervenes in theurban public domain: the role of the media interface in the encouragement oravoidance of various social relations. The remarkable thing about Body Movies is, writes Scott McQuire, that the installation attracts a temporary audience of strangers who briefly engage in aplayful experience with each other and who discover that they can influence theambience by performing a collective choreography. 13This places Lozano-Hem- mer's work in the context of the influential French curator and art critic NicholasBourriaud's concept of \"relational aesthetics\", in which the aim of the work ofart is not an artistic expression for its own sake, but to bring about new socialrelationships. 14 This spontaneous choreography is fostered in part by Lozano-Hemmer's spe- cic approach to interactivity. Usually an interactive system in the public realm isdesigned so that only one interaction is possible at one time: something or some-one provides some form of input, upon which the installation produces an out-come. In this case there are two possibilities: either members of the public use theinstallation one at a time (\"taking turns\"), in which they each influence theinstallation in their own way, or the system utilizes a mechanism to gauge theaverage user and produces a result on this basis (\"taking averages\"). Lozano-Hemmer nds both these options unsatisfactory. For him it is important thatnumerous people can participate in Body Movies simultaneously and that their mutual interaction plays a role in the total result. Each participant may take partin his or her own discrete way without that interaction evaporating into a demo-cratic average; simultaneously all sorts of collective patterns emerge. 15 For this reason Lozano-Hemmer prefers to speak of \"relational architecture\" rather than interactivity, a term that is now so widely applied as to be renderedvirtually meaningless. Too often it is used in the reactive sense, that is, the userpushes a button and something happens according to a predetermined pattern.The term \"relational\" is intended to express the multiplicity of relationships thathis work can generate: \"'Relational' has a more horizontal quality; it's more col-67 Martijn de Waallective. Events happen in elds of activity that may have resonances in several places in the network.\"16He believes that a designer of interactive systems must not work in an excessively top-down fashion. The aim is not to anticipate allpossible outcomes in advance and thus to conceive a xed and manageable pat-tern. An interactive system should be designed with a certain degree of opennessso that users can appropriate it in ways not anticipated by the artist. 17 Several critics have made a connection between the way in which Lozano- Hemmer attempts to provoke fleeting social relationships and the theories aboutthe urban public domain of writers such as Richard Sennett and Jane Jacobs. Asearly as the 1960s, in her influential book The Death and Life of Great AmericanCities, Jacobs pointed to the importance of everyday, apparently trivial andshort-lived interactions in the public domain. As trivial as they may be, they areindispensable for building mutual trust among citizens. 18 Sennett, on the other hand, sketches a development in which the urban public domain is increasingly dominated by non-communication: \"There grew up thenotion that strangers had no right to speak to each other, that each man pos-sessed as a public right an invisible shield, a right to be left alone.\" 19Sennett sees the beginning of this development in Paris in the 1860s, with the installation ofthe caf\u00e9 terraces on the French capital's newly laid-out boulevards. The public isno longer the active public that populated the coffee houses of the seventeenthcentury, but a passive public of loners lost in their own thoughts. At best, theyallow their gaze to glide across the spectacle of the boulevard like a fl\u00e2neur, againprimarily as a passive public. \"That is how the flaneur is to be appreciated\",writes Sennett, \"he is to be watched, not spoken to.\" 20In the twentieth century Sennett even sees a trend in which citizens increasingly retreat to geographicalzones where they feel at ease and, above all, where they encounter similar peo-ple. 21 Anthropological research into how urban populations use digital media seems to suggest that this trend continues at the beginning of the twenty-rstcentury. For example, the Norwegian researcher Rich Ling has shown that peo-ple use mobile phones in various urban situations primarily to maintain contactwith people in their own social network. These contacts are, he argues, at theexpense of interaction with strangers who, although physically present, may beignored. 22Many of the commercial initiatives in the hybrid city are also based on personalization. For example, there are interfaces available for mobile phonesthat guide people to places that t their personal prole or where they willmainly encounter their \"own kind\". This interface thus functions as a lter inorder to avoid contact with strangers. Can a hybrid interface such as that of Body Movies counteract this develop- ment? Can such an intervention encourage people to interact with each other, nomatter how briefly? Can interaction design seduce citizens into breaking the68 body moviessilence? Sennett's work, McQuire argues, demonstrates that his ideal of urban culture is not a natural state, but is conditioned. An installation such as Body Movies can play a role in this respect: Through mutual participation, people discover they are able to intervene - albeit ephemerally - in the look and feel of central city public space. In short,they are platforms encouraging creative public behaviour, enabling the city tobecome an experimental public space. 23 Perhaps this is asking too much of artists. Nevertheless, the importance of inter- ventions such as Lozano-Hemmer's resides, at least in part, in this notion. Theyshow that an alternative interface design is possible which stimulates briefencounters as part of everyday urban life. The city as interface This brings us to the nal point. Body Movies invites us to look at the urban pub- lic domain in a new way. With the hybridization of the urban public domain, allkinds of interfaces play a mediating role in the manner in which social relationsare given spatial form. In the debate about the urban public domain, it thereforeseems meaningful to shift attention to the role of interfaces, or even to view thecity itself entirely as an interface. That is not an entirely new idea. Manuel Castells has already compared the function of the urban public domain with that of an interface. According toCastells, everyday urban life largely revolves around adapting individual identi-ties to collective ones, the present to the past, and the concerns of various urbancollectives to each other. For Castells the city is a material reflection of social rep-resentations, and so forms a site where individuals can relate to these social rep-resentations: Cities have always been communication systems, based on the interface between individual and communal identities and shared social representations.It is their ability to organize this interface materially in forms, in rhythms, incollective experience and communicable perception that makes cities produc-ers of sociability, and integrators of otherwise destructive creativity. 24 However, debates about the urban public domain have until now emphasized the spatial aspects of these social processes. Often the central question is whetherthere are still sufcient urban spaces where such exchanges can take place. Arethey not under pressure from, for example, the car, the television and the emer-gence of shopping centres and gated communities?69 Martijn de WaalThe problem with this view is not that this criticism is unjust: indeed and urban society cannot exist without moments of exchange, conflict and adapta- tion. But with the use of the term \"interface\" I wish to shift the emphasis fromthe site of interfacing to the process itself. This avoids, for example, that we mustimagine the demise of the urban public domain and it offers the possibility ofexploring whether these social processes may surface in new ways and in unex-pected domains. The second reason I choose to approach the city as an interface is that inter- faces are literally beginning to play an important role in urban life. Peopleincreasingly experience the city around them via the virtual environment of thescreens of their laptops and mobile phones. Encounters, conflicts and the processof adapting (or \"interfacing\") now occur not only spatially but are also mediatedby the interfaces of social networking sites, blogs and location-based services. Third, and last, the term \"interface\" directs our attention to the process of mediation that takes place via the interface. The software that runs on a mobiletelephone is not a neutral environment. The way in which it is programmed - therestrictions and possibilities that it offers - contribute to dening the way inwhich we experience our environment. The term \"interface\" contains a notionof what Bruno Latour calls a \"mediator\": \"'mediators' transform, translate, dis-tort and modify the meaning or the elements they are supposed to carry\". 25The use of the term \"interface\" indicates that a process of adaptation takes place inwhich the medium itself partially determines the entity in which this may beachieved. It is not a neutral environment, but contributes to the manner in whichthis occurs. Some of these interfaces will probably hinder exchange and con-frontation. But a project such as Body Movies demonstrates that alternatives are also possible. Notes 1.

We are witnessing a global \"ludification of culture\". Since the 1960s, in which the word \"ludic\"became popular in Europe and the United States to designate playful behaviourand artefacts, playfulness has increasingly become a mainstream characteristicof our culture. Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind in this context is theimmense popularity of computer games, which, as far as global sales are con-cerned, have already outstripped Hollywood. According to a recent study in theUnited States, 8 to 18 year olds play computer games on average for one hourand a half each day on their consoles, computers and handheld gaming devices(including mobile phones). 1This is by no means only a Western phenomenon. In South Korea, for example, about two-thirds of the country's total populationfrequently plays online games, turning computer gaming into one of the fastest-growing industries and \"a key driver for the Korean economy\". 2 Although perhaps most visible, computer game culture is only one manifesta- tion of the process of ludification that is penetrating every cultural domain.3In our present experience economy, for example, playfulness not only characterizesleisure time (fun shopping, game shows on television, amusement parks, playfulcomputer and Internet use), but also domains that used to be serious, such aswork (which should chiefly be fun nowadays), education (serious gaming), poli-tics (ludic campaigning) and even warfare (video games like war simulators and75interfaces). According to Jeremy Rifkin, \"play is becoming as important in the cultural economy as work was in the industrial economy\".4In ludic culture, sociologist Zygmunt Bauman argues, playfulness is no longer restricted to child-hood, but has become a lifelong attitude: \"The mark of postmodern adulthood isthe whole-heartedly.\" 5Bauman's remark sug- gests that in postmodern culture identity has become a playful phenomenon too. In this article we want to re-visit Johan Huizinga's Homo ludens (1938) to reflect on the meaning of ludic technologies in contemporary culture. First wewill analyze the concept of \"play\". Next, we will discuss some problematicaspects of Huizinga's theory, which are connected with the fundamental ambigu-ities that characterize play phenomena, and reformulate some of the basic ideasof Huizinga. On the basis of this reformulation we will analyze the ludic dimen-sion of new media and sketch an outline of our theory of ludic identity construc-tion. Homo ludens 1.0 Viewing man and world sub specie ludi is of course not a new phenomenon. Ludicaccounts of man and world have been formulated at all times and in all cultures. InWestern culture we can witness an important development during the past twocenturies. Whereas the Enlightenment did not show a deep interest in play, the Romantic movement heralded a new fascination for this phenomenon. Friedrich Schiller - who can be regarded the founding father of contemporary ludology -even considered the play drive as the core of humanity, as it would enable man toreconcile necessity and freedom. As he famously phrased it: \"Man plays onlywhen he is in the full sense of the word man, and he is only wholly Man when he is playing.\" 6Alongside reasoning (Homo sapiens) and making (Homo faber), play- ing (Homo ludens) now advanced to the centre of attention. Philosophers such asNietzsche, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Gadamer, Marcuse, Deleuze and Derrida(most of them considered as forerunners or representatives of postmodern cul-ture) followed the ludological footprints of Heraclites and Schiller in their attempts to transform modern, predominantly rationalistic and utilitarian ontol- ogy and anthropology. 7But in the natural sciences, social sciences and humani- ties, a strong interest in play - and the related phenomenon game - grew as well.One can think, for example, of the implementation of game theory in biology, 8 economics9and cultural anthropology.10In addition to the interest in the phe- nomena of play and games in these already existing disciplines, in the last decades- motivated by the substantial growth of leisure time and the growth of ludo-in-dustry and ludo-capitalism 11- several new disciplines entirely devoted to the study of play and (computer) games have emerged.12 A foundational work in the contemporary study of play is Johan Huizinga's76 homo ludens . This book, first published in Dutch in 1938 and translated in to many other languages in the subsequent decades, can be considered as \"the key modernist statement onplay\". 13\"Richly suggestive and admirably broad in scope, it provides the first full-blown theory of ludics, and it remains moreover, seven decades after it firstappeared, an inevitable point of reference for any 'serious' discussion of play\". 14 In our Playful Identities project, too, Homo ludens has been an important source of inspiration. The book is still so impressive because of its grand ambition and scope. Already the subtitle - \"a study of the play element of culture\"15- and the fore- word of Homo ludens, makes clear that Huizinga's ambition is no less than tooffer a genealogy that explains how \"civilization arises and unfolds in and asplay\". 16In the second-to-last - - Huizinga summarizes his argument: It has not been difficult to show that a certain play-factor was extremely active all through the cultural process and that it produces many of the fundamentalforms of social life. The spirit of playful competition is, as a social impulse,older than culture itself and pervades all life like a veritable ferment. Ritualgrew up in sacred play; poetry was born in play and nourished on play; musicand dancing were pure play. Wisdom and philosophy found expression inwords and forms derived from religious contests. The rules of warfare, the con-ventions of noble living were built up on play-patterns. We have to conclude,therefore, that civilization is, in its earliest phases, played. It does not comefrom play like a babe detaching itself from the womb: it arises in and asplay, and never leaves it. 17 This summary makes clear that Homo ludens is not primarily a study of play or games, but rather \"an inquiry into the creative quality of the play principle in thedomain of culture\". 18However, the first chapter of the book offers a definition of the play phenomenon, quoted in virtually every book on play and games pub-lished since then: Summing up the formal characteristics of play we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside \"ordinary\" life as being \"not meant\",19but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity con-nected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceedswithin its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rulesand in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings whichtend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress their difference from thecommon world by disguise or other means. 2077 Valerie Frissen, Jos de Mul and Joost RaessensLet us elucidate six elements of this definition. First, like Schiller and the Roman- tics before him, Huizinga defines play as expression of human freedom vis-\u00e0-vis both nature and morality.21Play, like beauty in nature and art, to which it is closely related, is \"disinterested\", \"distinct from 'ordinary life'\", \"it contains itsown course and meaning\", and presents itself as an \"intermezzo, an interlude in our daily lives\". 22Playing is \"non-serious\"23in the sense that it is not character- ized by our daily concern for food, shelter and everything else fragile beings likeus need in order to survive. Play takes place \"outside and above the necessitiesand seriousness of everyday life\". 24It is beyond profane seriousness. However, this does not exclude the fact that the activity of playing requires total devotionfrom the player. Playing is no mere \"fun\", but earnest, even \"holy earnest\". 25For Huizinga, this is no (mere) figurative all its higher forms the lat-ter [human play] at any rate always belongs to the sphere of the festival and rit-ual - the sacred sphere.\" 26In order to distinguish this kind of intrinsic, sacred earnestness from profane seriousness we might call it sacred seriousness. Second, playing is \"not meant\"; it refers to an activity of \"just pretending\". The thing represented in the play is not real. Playing is only doing as if. Huizinga calls this \"the consciousness that it [play] is 'different' from 'ordinary life'\".27 Third, play is not only immersive in that it absorbs the player intensively; it is also \"accompanied by a feeling of tension, joy\".28According to Huizinga, the \"play-mood is one of rapture and enthusiasm, and is sacred or festive in accor-dance with the occasion. A feeling of exaltation and tension accompanies theaction, mirth and relaxation follow.\" 29 Fourth, play is distinct from ordinary life both in terms of locality and dura- tion. It is characterized by specific limits of time and space: The magic circle of play is not only a spatial circle, but a temporal one as well. It takes place inand as what we might call a magic cycle: \"It can be repeated at any time, whether it be'child's play' or a game of chess, or at fixed intervals like a mystery. In this facultyof repetition lies one of the most essential qualities of play.\" 30 Fifth, the rules that constitute the play-world are crucial to the concept: \"All play has its rules. They determine what 'holds' in the temporary world circum-scribed by play. The rules of a game are absolutely binding and allow no doubt.\" 31 \"As soon as the rules are transgressed, the whole play-world collapses.\"32Where- as the cheater still pretends to play and in doing so still acknowledges the magiccircle and cycle, \"the player who trespasses against the rules or ignores them is a'spoil-sport'\". 33 Sixth, play \"creates order, is order. Into an imperfect world and into the con- fusion of life it brings a temporary, a limited perfection\".34Play is \"indispensible for the well-being of the community, fecund of cosmic insight and social develop-ment\". 35 As Huizinga considers play to be a fundamental \"category of life\", the play-78 homo ludens 2.0definition presented in the first chapter of Homo ludens has a universal ring. Huizinga explicitly claims that \"all peoples play, and play remarkably alike\"36, and he distinguishes two basic forms of play: \"The two ever-recurrent forms in which civilization grow in and as play are sacred performance and festal con-test.\" 37In Les jeux et les hommes (1958), a critical elaboration of Huizinga's work, Roger Caillois presents a typology consisting of four categories. In addi-tion to the two forms mentioned by Huizinga - which Caillois terms simulation(mimicry), ranging from children's imitation play to theatre, and competition (ag\u00f4n), free play, regulated sports, contests etc. - he distinguishes chance ( alea), as we find it, for example, in counting-out rhymes and lotteries, and vertigo(ilinx), ranging from merry-go-round \"whirling\" to mountain climbing. Cross-cutting this classification of game types Caillois discerns two play attitudes:paidia and ludus. Paidia refers to \"free play\", improvisation, carefree gaiety and laughter, spontaneous, impulsive, joyous, uncontrolled fantasy. Ludus on the other hand disciplines and enriches paidia, since it refers to \"gaming\", moreexplicitly rule-governed forms of play, that often involve specific skills and mas-tery. 38In each of the four categories, play phenomena are located somewhere between the poles of paidia and ludus. However, ag\u00f4n and alealean to the pole of ludus, while ilinx and mimicry tend towards paidia. Taken together, these two classifications are useful tools for the analysis of the ludification of contempo-rary culture. Before directing our attention to the playful dimension of information and communication technologies, we have to return to Huizinga's historical analysisfor a moment. Although he emphasizes that all culture \"arises and unfolds inand as play\", he does not claim that cultures always keep playing. Echoing the pessimistic tone of Spengler's Der Untergang des Abendlandes (1918-1923), Huizinga argues that cultures are most playful in their youth, and graduallybecome more serious and lose their playfulness as they grow more mature. 39For Huizinga, Romanticism was the last stage in Western culture that still had a play-ful spirit. And in the dark-toned last chapter of the book, on the play-element intwentieth-century culture, Huizinga states the play element in culture is \"on thewane\": \"civilization to-day is no longer played\". 40 Huizinga acknowledges that this observation seems to be at odds with the fact that sports and popular culture have become a major industry in twentieth-cen-tury culture. However, he discerns two contradictory tendencies with regard tothe relationship of play and seriousness that in his view both lead to a blurring ofboundaries between play and (profane) seriousness. On the one hand, Huizinga,referring to professional sports, claims that play becomes more and more seri-ous, resulting in a loss of playfulness. 41On the other hand, he claims that we wit- ness a growing playfulness in the sphere of profane seriousness, for example, incommercial competition. 4279 Valerie Frissen, Jos de Mul and Joost RaessensFor Huizinga, these tendencies do not lead to a more playful culture, but rather are expressions of cheating - \"false play\" - and for that reason undermine (playful) culture as such.43He points at several \"external factors independent of culture proper\"44responsible for the decay of playful culture, particularly the global commercialization of culture45and the emergence of puerilism (a \"blend of adolescence and barbarity\"46), both supported by the technology of modern communication.47This culture is characterized by an \"insatiable thirst for trivial recreation and crude sensationalism, the delight of mass meetings\", and a com-plete lack of \"humour, the very idea of decency and fair play\". 48 We should not forget that Huizinga wrote these bitter words in 1938, with the disconcerting memories of the First World War still in mind, and in terrifyinganticipation of the no less outrageous barbarisms of the emerging fascist move-ments. However, in our view, Huizinga's pessimism is not only motivated by thehistorical context, but points at real contradictions in his argument. If we wantto use Huizinga's penetrating insights into play as a fundamental category tounderstand the ludification of contemporary, strongly mediated culture, we firsthave to come to terms with these contradictions, which point at fundamentalambiguities of the play phenomenon itself. Semi-serious interlude Despite of its inspiring insights, Homo ludens still puzzles the reader because of its many contradictions and ambiguities. Let us mention the four most impor-tant of them. First, play is presented as being both reality and appearance. On the one hand, Huizinga presents play as a key dimension in human life and evenmaintains that culture is only possible in and as play; on the other hand, heargues that play entirely takes place outside everyday life and is nothing morethan a disinterested \"interlude\". 49Play is \"indispensable for the well-being of the community, fecund of cosmic insight and social development\", and simulta-neously it is \"only pretending\" and, accordingly, inferior to real life. 50Because of its reality, we play with \"holy earnest\", yet it is completely non-serious. Second,play is both freedom and force. According to Huizinga, play is a celebration ofhuman freedom, yet he believes that \"it casts a spell over us\", 51because it demands complete absorption. Moreover, although the rules of the game are\"absolutely binding\", players are constantly trespassing these rules. Third,games are both determined and changing. Huizinga emphasizes that the rules ofa game are absolute, and simultaneously Homo ludens is principally a historical narrative about the never-ending transformation of play into various culturalforms. Fourth, as an activity play is both individual and collective. Although theplayer is absorbed in his own, private play-world, generally he plays with oragainst other players in a shared play-world, often before an audience. 52More-80 homo ludens 2.0over, in the case of mimicry the player is pretending to be someone else, creating a community of personae within himself. Scholars such as Ehrmann (1968) and Motte (2009) also pointed out these ambiguities and criticized Huizinga for being entangled in contradictions.According to Ehrmann, the \"hierarchical dichotomy\", in which play is under-stood as a representation of a reality existing prior to and independently from play, is very problematic, as \"there is no 'reality' (ordinary or extraordinary!)out side of or prior to the manifestations of the culture that expresses it\". 53 Motte rightly argues that Huizinga shows a greater sensitivity towards the ambi-guity of play than Ehrmann attributes to him. However, Huizinga is not able toexplain thatand how culture (sacred seriousness) and ordinary life (profane seri- ousness) can merge in and asplay. Eugen Fink states that we cannot arrive at such an explanation as long as we stick to the modernist dichotomy of - on thelevel of attitude - play and seriousness, and - on the ontological level - play andreality. 54What distinguishes playing from sheer serious modes of being on the one hand and sheer fantasy on the other, is that the player simultaneously is both in the ordinary world and in the play-world and that we all are aware of simulta- neously being in both worlds.55 Here again, the play-experience is very close to aesthetic experience. Aesthetic experience is characterized by a similar double experience. This ambiguous,double experience is connected with human reflexivity, the fact that humanbeings not only experience, but are also, and at the same time, able to experiencetheir experience. In the language of Plessner's philosophical anthropology:human experience is simultaneously centric and eccentric. Being (ec)centricimplies that we can go beyond our immediate experience and imagine ourselvesin another experience, though all the time we remain bound to our immediateexperience. 56As a consequence, when we engage into playful activities, we do not, as Huizinga and Caillois suggest, step outside the everyday world into themagic circle of the play-world, but we double our existence, as Eugen Fink main-tains. 57 This double character of play has several important implications for a correct understanding of the phenomenon of play. In the first place, Huizinga's remarkthat play creates order gains a deeper meaning. This order is not so much a tem-porary order completely outside or beyond everyday reality, but rather a layer ofmeaning that during play is superimposed on everyday reality. In the act of play profane reality is enriched by a layer of sacred seriousness. Augmented realitybefore technology! A second implication of the double-character of play is that, just because the immersion in the play-world is always accompanied by the experience that \"it'sjust play\", the rules that guide play are necessarily experienced as being relative,flexible and changeable. Just because we are both inside and outside the magic81 Valerie Frissen, Jos de Mul and Joost Raessenscircle, we are able to reflect on the rules as \"just play rules\". They are always open to modification. This is in sharp contrast with Huizinga's emphasis on theabsolute character of rules. Moreover, playing with the rules is inherent to many forms of play. Connecting to the flexibility of play, Minnema gives an interesting explana- tion for the growing interest in play in nineteenth- and twentieth-century cul-ture. Following Luhmann, he maintains that since the start of the modern ageWestern culture has transformed the hitherto hierarchically stratified structureof society into a differentiated structure, consisting of many substructures, suchas politics, economy, law, education, science, technology and art, that each pos-sess relative autonomy and have their own specific rules. This causes a muchhigher level of societal complexity and flexibility. 58 According to Minnema, the twentieth-century fascination with play and games is strongly connected withthis societal development. Play becomes a rite de passage, a room for new(re)combinations of actions and thoughts, a database of alternative models forliving. 59However, unlike premodern and modern rites, postmodern rites no longer seem to have a clearly demarcated transformational (liminal) period, buthave become a never-ending (liminoid) phenomenon, an integral part of thesocio-economical, cultural and multimedial system. 60 When we talk about the ludification of culture we are confronted with the question whether this ludification consists of an increase of playful activities orrather a transformation of perspective, in which we use play as a metaphor tounderstand entities and domains that in themselves are not necessarily consid-ered playful. We think both answers are correct. On the one hand, contrary towhat Huizinga claims, the Romantic movement Western culture has witnessed aremarkable revival of the \"ludic worldview\" (Huizinga's Homo ludens being one of the fruits of this developments!). On the other hand, this change in per-spective has also generated the development of new ludic attitudes, practices andobjects, which, in their turn, further stimulate the ludification of our worldview.In principle, no single \"serious domain\" within human life is expelled from \"lud-ification\". This even counts for the \"serious domain\" that Huizinga consideredembodying the very decay of playfulness: modern technology. Ludic technologies Huizinga's claim that the ludic worldview has disappeared since the beginning ofthe nineteenth century is questionable; the same goes for his claim that play andtechnology are incompatible. According to Erkki Huhtamo, \"the introduction oflarge-scale machine production [in the nineteenth century] was accompanied byan avalanche of different devices that provided amusement, including game-play\". 61Moreover, we assert that in our contemporary culture, deeply entrenched82 homo ludens 2.0with digital technologies, play is the key feature for understanding this culture and \"playful technologies\" are the very means by which we - as we will see in thenext section - reflexively construct our identity. When we talk about the medium-specific ludic characteristics of digital infor- mation and communication technologies, we by no means refer to a set of essen-tialist qualities. As we have argued above, playfulness does not reside in a singlecharacteristic, but should rather be understood as a set of characteristics, whichcan appear in activities in a variety of more or less overlapping combinations.The question is what possibilities (and limitations) for play are being provided tousers by digital media such as computer games, the Internet and mobilephones. 62A playful possibility is only \"virtual\" until it is actualized by the play- ful attitude of the user and experienced as such. This search for opportunities toplay goes hand in hand with what we earlier called a transformation of perspec-tive. Regarding digital media as ludic practices enables us to conceptualize themin specific terms (as we will discuss in more detail below). The characteristics of digital media that we are focusing on here are multime- diality, virtuality, interactivity and connectivity. 63Multimediality refers to the multitude of means of expression, such as images (still or moving), sound (talk,music, and noises) and written text, but also, and foremost, to the fact that theseelements share one common digital code, a characteristic with all kinds of eco-nomic and legal implications. 64The second characteristic of digital media, virtu- ality, traditionally refers to immersive experiences provided by new forms ofsimulation technology (think of virtual reality), as well as to metaphorical spacescreated by communication networks (think of the space which comes into beingwhen you're talking on the telephone). But, as Michiel de Lange rightly argues,these descriptions were mostly \"founded on two ontologies that were mutuallyexclusive, the real and the virtual. Much current (mobile) media research ques- tions this separation. Mobile phone 'virtualities' are third char- acteristic, interactivity orparticipation, digital media afford different levels of engagement in which users can \"intervene in a meaningful way within the repre-sentation itself\". 67According to Salen and Zimmerman, this intervention can assume two different forms. The first one they call \"explicit interactivity: or par-ticipation with designed choices and procedures\". The second form is \"beyond-the-object-interactivity: or participation within the culture of the object\". 68We can think, for example, of the co-construction of online games in fan cultures orWeb 2.0applications which enable their users to co-shape websites. An example of the fourth characteristic, connectivity , is Facebook, which is the largest social network site in the world, with more than 500 million active subscribers.69 The concept of play, as elaborated on by Huizinga, is a very useful starting83 Valerie Frissen, Jos de Mul and Joost Raessenspoint for the analysis of the media experience. Our media and play experiences have many characteristics and ambiguities in common. Or, to put it differently:digital media afford users new opportunities to play. To show how digitalmedia's medium-specificity opens up particular possibilities for play, we have totake into account the six elements of play we distinguished above. The first element, expression of human freedom, can be subdivided in three parts: freedom to play, freedom to make decisions while you are playing andfreedom towards the world. 70What is striking when we take a close look at how these kinds of freedom take shape in actual media use, is that freedom and forceare not, as Huizinga claims, as diametrically opposed as we have argued abovewhen discussing the ambiguities in his analysis. The freedom to play becomesvisible in the player's decision to do so. But when you (are forced to) play tomake a living, play and work, as well as freedom and force, become entangled inthe most curious of ways. The freedom to make meaningful decisions refers to the interactive or partici- patory nature of digital media. As Huizinga states, play is a \"free activity \" (our italics). An example of the rise of participatory culture is the transition from Web1.0 to Web 2.0. Instead of few producers of media content sending it out it to themasses by limited television or radio channels, Web 2.0turns anyone with access to the web into a potential content provider who can report on specific, idiosyn-cratic topics to a targeted audience. The fact that media users are only to a cer-tain extent \"in control\" we will discuss further on in relation to the rules of play. To play, finally, also means that you are free from the constraints of the out- side world; it is beyond the \"profane seriousness\" we referred to earlier. Theclaim that play should have \"its aim in itself\" 71seems difficult to hold in today's gaming culture where items from massively multiplayer online role-playinggames (MMORPGs) are being traded on online auction and shopping websitessuch as eBay, and where serious games seem to employ play for educational pur-poses. But, according to Hector Rodriguez, this is not necessarily the case. 72 Playing serious games can not only be used \"as a vehicle to maximize the 'effec-tiveness' of teaching\" but also to illuminate \"the fundamental nature of the sub-ject being taught\". This means that in serious games such as Food Force and Darfur is Dying profane and sacred seriousness are not beforehand mutually exclusive, as is claimed by some critics. 73 The second element, pretending, refers to (digital) media use and/or under- standing as doing as if, or, the double character of media. Like play, \"our mediaculture consists of the acceptance of the 'as-if-ness' of the world\". 74The reason for this is related to what Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin call \"the two log-ics of remediation\". Even when (digital) media obey the logic of transparentimmediacy - which means that it is the medium's purpose to disappear - think of\"the promise of immediacy through the flexibility and liveness of the web's net-84 homo ludens 2.0worked communication\"75- they, at the same time, obey the logic of hypermedi- acy. This means that a user is constantly reminded of or brought back into con- tact with (the constructedness of) the interface, in the case of the web the fillingof the screen with windows, each with a variety of multimedia applications. 76 Media users are, in principle, in a position to realize that the reality they are fac-ing \"is just mediated\". It is the explicit goal of media education to make mediausers more aware of the ways in which media try to erase their own constructed-ness (for example, their own ideological presuppositions) in order to comeacross as spontaneous and transparent presentations of so-called \"reality\". To analyze the pleasures (and/or displeasures) of digital media use, the third element, we have to take into account the medium-specific relationships betweenproduction, media texts and reception. Consequently, we have to focus on thequestion of \"how pleasure is generated in the relationship between the rules andscripts developed by producers and how they are experienced and engaged withby users\". 77The suggestion of advertising and marketing campaigns that digital media would offer more fun and pleasure than traditional media seems unten-able to us. We do claim that digital media offer a wide diversity of complex pleas-ures that - dependent of particular users and contexts - are partly the same (forexample, the pleasure of narrative), partly more intensive (for example, thepleasure of immersion), as well as partly different than what traditional mediahave to offer. Specific to digital media are those displeasures and pleasuresthat are related to interactivity, such as computer game addiction and boredomor frustration (\"World Wide Wait\") and the feeling of being in and out of con-trol, the tension of winning or loosing, succeeding or failing, and those pleasuresthat can be experienced, on the one hand, by submitting and confirming to therules as well as, on the other hand, by negotiating or resisting them. 78 The fourth element, specific limits of time and space , seems to be subjected to great pressure in this time of ubiquitous computing. It is, on the contrary, theillimitability of the mobile phone, which seems to be the defining (and at thesame time liberating and restraining) characteristic of today's media culture. 79 This does not mean however that digital media would not have a separate timeand place: The media have the capacity, indeed they entirely depend upon that capac- ity, to engage an audience within spaces and times that are distinguished - marked off - from the otherwise relentless confusions of everyday life. Thereis a threshold to be crossed each time we participate in the process of media-tion. 80 This shows, for example, when we focus on security issues. Digital media users can, as players do, try out or test or experiment with new identities, something85 Valerie Frissen, Jos de Mul and Joost Raessensthat does not need to have real-life consequences.81The limits also come to the fore on moments when a user wants to continue (the magic cycle) but is forced, by external reasons, to stop using the medium. The rules of play, the fifth element, can either be accepted or played with, on an individual (micro-)level as well as on the (macro-)level of the media system.On the one hand, digital media submit users to their rules. Within specific limits,there is freedom for the user to play. Individual users give what Stuart Hall called\"preferred readings\" of a media text 82and/or select one of the many pre-pro- grammed system-internal possibilities of a digital media system. In both casesusers play according to the rules. On the other hand, users can play with theserules in - more or less - subversive ways. Here, users are involved in \"opposi-tional readings\" of media texts, and/or on a macro-level try to change the rela-tionship between media producers, distributors and consumers. Yet we need tobe careful. The concept of participatory culture is in danger of overstating theimportance of do-it-yourself counterculture. 83Media also impose their logics on us in a dialectic between freedom and force.84 The sixth element, order, is related to the formation of social groupings. A good example of a Web 2.0 application that creates a community-based tempo-rary order is the so-called green blog. This is in line with F\u00e9lix Guattari's analysisof a post-media age \"in which the media will be re-appropriated by a multitude of subject-groups capable of directing its resingularisation\". 85 Approaching digital media as playful practices enables us to conceptualize them in terms of the four ambiguities we discerned earlier on.86The first ambigu- ity refers to the \"as-if-ness\" character of media: reality and appearance are not strictly separated but are interrelated in meaningful ways. Digital media, howreal they may seem, enable users to become (more or less) aware of the construct-edness of their media experiences. This implies a second ambiguity, that of free- dom versus force. As is the case with play, we are able to reflect on the rules as\"just play rules\" and always open for modification, both on a basic, micro-level(the individual user that interacts with a media text and/or technology) and on amacro-level (changes in the relationships between media producers, distributorsand consumers). There is a dialectic relationship between freedom and force: wecan play and are \"being played\" at the same time. The third ambiguity is that ofdetermination versus change. Each medium pretends to be the final phase of along-lasting development - think of the web's claim for immediacy based on itsflexible and live networked communication possibilities, and the mobile phone'sclaim to realize the desire for ideal communication. 87But, as history shows, many if not most of these claims are being outdated by the arrival and claims ofnewer media. The liveness of the web, for example, is \"a refashioned version ofthe liveness of broadcast television\". 88The fourth ambiguity, individuality ver- sus collectivity , deals with the identity of individual media in today's media land-86 homo ludens 2.0scape. This landscape can be characterized by the concepts of \"convergence\" (\"an ongoing process or series of intersections between different media sys-tems\") 89or \"remediation\" (\"the representation of one medium in another\").90 Think of the web's claim to represent or absorb all other media. Because alltoday's media - consoles, computers, mobile phones - have play applicationsand, thus, can be used as play devices, they lose a bit of their presumed individualidentity and become part of and play their role in a collective playful media land-scape. The mobile phone, to take one example, has developed over time from astrict communication tool into a multimedia computer you can play on, with,and through. Moreover, the converging multimedia landscape also providesextremely fruitful soil for cross-media games and virals, as well for the creationof online game worlds that combine, in various (re)combinations, ag\u00f4n, mim- icry, alea, and ilinx, such as World of Warcraft and Second Life. Playful identities In this article we have critically examined Huizinga's and Caillois' insights intoplay to understand the ludification of contemporary culture. Depending on thedominant category of play, as theorized by Caillois, postmodern identity dis-plays four basic dimensions. The competitive identity dimension transforms everything - from economical production and consumption to education, scien-tific research and even love relationships, into a game with winners and losers.The simulational identity dimension expresses itself in theatrical performance rather than in (romantic) inwardness. This postmodern identity dimension findsits expression predominantly in the society of the spectacle. 91The aleatory dimension highlights how people are \"thrown\" into certain conditions by birth or during life by act of fate, in what Giddens calls \"fateful moments\".92At the same time it underlines how people may embrace a profound openness to the -happy or fateful - contingencies of life. For this type of identity the risk society isthe \"natural habitat\". The vertigo identity dimension is characterized by thrill- seeking. Here, we could think of the kind of fatalistic, Dionysian behaviourregarding the use of drugs or risky sexual behaviour that characterizes manyyouth cultures. 93 Just as in the case of the different types of games and media, the four identity dimensions that characterize postmodern society often overlap and connect invarious playful ways. For example, in order to deal with life as aleatory gamble,people may adopt strategies that correspond with one of the other play types.People may try to regain mastery over life's unpredictability by dragging aleainto the domain of ag\u00f4n; they may try to conceal certain conditions by living alife of mimicry pretence; or they may attempt to run away from it by escaping inilinx thrill-seeking. And the body builder in the school of martial arts often is not87 Valerie Frissen, Jos de Mul and Joost Raessensonly engaged in competition with his peers, but also likes to show off his muscles in the public space, and/or likes to take a chance by using steroids. In each of these intertwined dimensions playful personae are confronted with ambiguities we described with Huizinga in our analysis of play (section 2) andplayful media (section 3). First, these playful personae are constantly oscillatingbetween reality and appearance. They play their roles, just pretending that they are identical to them, but at the same time their role-playing is of the utmost seri-ousness and as such becomes a reality sui generis. Moreover, the competitions they engage in are not \"just play\", but have real-life consequences. Second, play-ful identities constantly oscillate between freedom and force. They play with their contingency, but at the same time they cannot escape the factuality of thesecontingencies. They express themselves in freedom, constantly experience theconstraints exercised upon them by media that themselves are subjected to thehomogeneous global forces of the market economy. And in a more radical sensethan experienced by previous generations, playful identities oscillate betweendeterminedness and change. Although as playful personae they enjoy the possi-bility to continuously changing masks, they still feel the everlasting longing forrest in the hard core of their subjectivity. Finally, playful identities constantlyoscillate between their individuality and the collective. In our playing they express their inmost subjectivity, but in doing so they constantly follow theirmimetic desire to be someone else. 94And above all, they embrace the game as wholeheartedly as the game embraces them.

Inaugurele Rede \"The Return of the Tragic in Postmodern Playful Practices Sybille Lammes Where was I? My neighbour recently looked up a Google Street View image of his tattoo parlour in Amsterdam. He noticed that his bicycle was parked in front of his shop, so hegathered that the specially equipped cars that made the panoramic photographswere traversing the city on one of his working days. Becoming intrigued he re-turned to the map and looked up the school of his children whom he always picksup on his non-working days. On the Google Street View image a crowd of parentswere gathering outside the school building. So he gured that the picture musthave been shot at the end of the school day. His bicycle was nowhere to be seen andtherefore his presumption that the cars drove through the city on one of his work-ing days must have been right. He then looked up his home address on the map andsaw that his car was not parked in front of the building. Did his wife go somewherethat day? On the square in front of the house he noticed a huge billboard withposters for the European elections. So now he knew that the Google cars musthave been visiting Amsterdam around June 2009. The story that my neighbour told me is a strong case in point of what I want to discuss in this window. What my neighbour did here was constructing a spa-tial story through the use of digital maps. He actually tried to reconstruct twospatial stories at once: that of his own movements (and of his wife and children)and that of the movement of the Google cars. That his stories may hinge on thearguably wrong presumption that the Google Street View Cars covered Amster-dam in one single day is of less importance here. More important is that he gotintrigued with the possibilities of digital cartographical technologies to constructspatial stories. 1Furthermore my neighbour did not create any story, but a story about the whereabouts of himself and his family. So his endeavours to create aspatial story were closely bound up with his (social) identity. He actually asked93himself the question Where am I? instead of Who am I? Moreover he described his whole project as something he did for fun, as a playful activity that was worthwhile sharing in a light conversation. This window is about the triad relation between digital mapping practices, spatial stories and playful identities that can be distilled from my neighbour'sstory. Contrary to what media scholars have been trying to argue about newmedia and contemporary cultures, 2digital mapping practices have actually brought us new senses of place and a strong urge to locate ourselves and tocome to terms with our identities through story-like constructions of our where-abouts. Central to my argument is the notion that digital cartographies allow agreater degree of two-way interaction between map and user than analoguemaps do. Digital map users are not just reading maps, but also constantly influ-ence the shape and look of the map itself. At home, at work and while travel-ling: maps have become more personal, transforming while we navigate withand through them. Digital maps have thus altered our conception of maps as\"objectied\" representations of space that has been a touchstone for centuries. 3 Instead, digital maps have become more personal sources for constructing sto-ries of one's whereabouts. 4This has also opened up new possibilities for maps to function as \"play equipment\" that allows users to engage in what play-theo-rist Sutton-Smith has called \"informal social play\" and \"performance play\". 5 Perhaps they are even an incarnation of what geographer John Kirkland Wrighthad in mind when he called in 1947 for an open acknowledgment and incorpo-ration of the emotional and imaginative connection between people, places andmaps. 6 My neighbour was using Google Maps on his desktop computer. So although the two spatial stories he constructed were all about mobility, he made his questfrom a more-or-less stationary position. Here I will actually take his story a stepfurther and discuss the playful use of digital maps on smartphones such as theiPhone and Android phones. The mobility of user and technology adds anotherlayer to the dynamics between map, spatial story and playful identity that isprevalent in my neighbour's story, because such phones \"house\" mapping tech-nologies that enable the user to use maps and locate its own position on that mapwhile being on the move. Increasingly smartphones are prime loci for digital mapping practices. 7One of the reasons that the use of maps has been so successful on smartphones is ofcourse the mobility of user and phone. Like taking an old map with you to checkyour route, you now have your phone with you, yet with the crucial differencethat your whereabouts are now rendered on the map itself that adapts to yourmobility and wishes. But besides the sheer convenience of having it all in yourpocket, I believe that the fascination with cartographical technologies on phonesshould also be seen as a counterbalance to the act of mobile phoning itself, which94 digital cartographies as playful practicesis very much about displacement. Location data attach a sense of physical loca- tion to mobile telephony by visualizing your whereabouts. Making things visible With the emergence of Android phones, the iPhone and other types of smart-phones, a myriad of highly popular applications and mash-ups have been devel-oped in which digital maps are used for more purposes than just solely ndingyour way. 8I will discuss two such applications: Foursquare and Layar. Four - square is a social networking game in which players gather points by checking inon locations they visit. Layar is an augmented reality browser, which allowsusers (as the name implies) to put a layer over its direct environment (cameraview or map) that, for example, shows local restaurants, houses for sale, peoplewho are on twitter, campaigns for music artists 9or games that have your own environment as the battleground. As the company describes Layar on its web-site: \"a beautiful fun augmented reality app that shows you the things you can'tsee\". In this catchphrase a feature of Layar is highlighted which actually holds for many digital mapping practices on mobile phones: the possibility of renderingvisible locations in your direct vicinity that otherwise would stay obscure orunknown. Locative social networks such as iPling, Plazes or Citysense, gameslike Assassin or Google Maps mash-ups (e.g. Panoramio) all share this playful fascination with nding and creating spatial connections that would otherwisenot be visible (or there at all). 10Take, for example, the Layar applications Tweeps Around.11In Twitter it remains opaque where tweets are sent from, let alone that you can situate them in relation to your own location.12Tweeps Around shows you geo-tagged tweets (e.g. \"@P: shopping list on the table\",\"having a shower\") of people in your vicinity and enables you to locate in detailwhere they have been sent from on the linked Google map. Thus your daily life isaugmented with a layer of spatial information that otherwise would have stayedunknown to you. Spatial stories According to De Certeau, creating spatial stories is a means to cope with andexperience spatial relations in daily life. As shown in the examples above, theyare personal explorations of spatial surroundings, performative acts in which thetraveller becomes the storymaker. De Certeau claimed that spatial stories are themain way in which we make sense of everyday life: they are the essential organiz-ing principle for all human activity. 13To understand how such spatial stories are created he made a distinction between space and place. Place refers to the95 Sybille Lammes\"proper\" ideologically informed order, to the way spatial positions are related in objective representations, such as maps. Space relates to how we deal with spa-tiality in daily life. He gives the example of walking in a city to explain what hemeans by this. The geometrical conguration of the streets he equates with place,while the act of traversing these streets on foot changes them into space. So, asplace is set and univocal, the notion of space has as many meanings as there arewalkers. 14De Certeau speaks of both terms as constantly influencing each other. He identies place as having the purpose to create unchanging and lifelessobjects. Space, on the other hand, presupposes a subjective goal and impliesmovement and change. In stories, these two determinations should be under-stood as reciprocal since an abstract place can become a lively and changeable,tangible space and vice versa. 15 As I have argued elsewhere, digital cartographical interfaces actually upset the distinction between maps as abstract and objectied, and the practice of goingsomewhere as a personal and subjective experience of space. 16De Certeau's dis- tinction of map and tour becomes problematic since maps are points of contactthat change appearances according to where we wish to move and, as the exampleof Tweeps Around so clearly demonstrates, what others wish us to see. Indeed,map and tour can no longer be easily distinguished. Digital maps are in this re-spect reminiscent of maps in pre-Renaissance Western cultures when traces oftouring were still visible on the map. Yet they also share similarities with certain\"gestural and performative\" mapping practices in non-Western cultures suchas the aboriginal songlines. 17The main shift is that users of digital maps are no longer mere readers of maps but have become cartographers on tour. However, to what extent and how users are being invited to make maps through a personal exploration of space, depends on the precise digital toolsinvolved. In Layar you can choose which information is superimposed on themap or photographic image of your environment, such as reviews of restaurantsnear to where you are. Still the question remains how much this is about creatingspatial stories. Certain applications, such as Tweeps Around, do trigger curiosityabout other people's spatial stories that may be woven into a grander spatialstory about the user's surroundings, similar to what my neighbour did. Others,such as the Rolling Stones application, may prompt you to add landmarks likeposters and flyers to your direct environment, thus encouraging you to be moredirectly involved in the creation of a spatial story. Nevertheless, I would say thatmost layars are not so much about your own local movements, but more aboutother people and \"things\" (buildings, monuments etc.) that surround you andcould prompt you to move in a particular way (e.g. going to see a lm). Similar toGoogle Earth, creating your own spatial story is thus largely determined by thelandmarks of others. Furthermore how you create such stories remains largelyout of focus. In that sense, Layar may be open to adding personal traces and con-96 digital cartographies as playful practicesduct, such as tweets or reviews, but it is still an old-fashioned map in the sense that it offers a pretext for your personal journey and is not primarily about thatsubjective journey itself. So although your own location is always the centre point of the chosen radius that you see in Layar, and (to paraphrase De Certeau) personal traces have re-appeared on the map, the emphasis is mostly put on \"local attractions\" that oth-ers have put on the map. Needless to say, what is being put on the map is oftencommercially driven, and thus as much an ideological product as maps are in DeCerteau's explanation. It actually adheres to a denition of augmented reality inwhich \"real life\" is very much dened by (post)capitalist interests. In relation toidentity, one could state that Layar changes your socio-spatial identity by offer-ing you playful tools for selecting locations in your vicinity that are considered ofsocial interest for you by others. Where am I headed? It is true that location-based social networking games like Foursquare or - theless competitive - Gowalla also offer you a selection of locales that are notentirely of your own making. Companies make money from localized advertise-ments and you can earn points if you check in at certain companies such as Star-bucks or an Apple store. 18So again, ideological motivations have not disap- peared, although the distinction between map and tour may have becomemuddled. Yet a crucial difference with Layar is that the emphasis shifts to puttingyourself on the map and showing others your spatial movements and where-abouts. Whilst Layar invites you to develop spatial stories, but mostly doesn'tshow them, such games are far more about showing the creation of your ownspatial stories through playing the game. Furthermore, they encourage you toshare them with other players whilst others are triggered to share their storieswith you. The central objective is to travel, gather points by visiting places and(albeit competitively) share your whereabouts with others. Your social identity isactually created by putting yourself on display for others to measure up and con-nect to. On a typical working day I always use Foursquare during my trip to work. After a short cycle ride I rst check in on my phone at the main railway station. Iopen the Foursquare application and choose the option \"places\" at the bottomof the screen to look at all identied \"locales\" in the vicinity. Besides the railwaystation, the list includes shops and platform numbers that can be selected forcheck-in. By clicking on a place, I can read more detailed information about it(e.g. \"great coffee, but bad service\") or can open a link to a Google map that pin-points where I am exactly. I can also add locations and information myself.When I check in at the railway station, Foursquare gives me the option to share97 Sybille Lammesthis information with friends on Facebook. It also shows me all the other people who have been checking in at the station that morning. The person who haschecked in most the last two months is identied as the mayor of the railway sta-tion. After the train has departed, I usually check in at the next train stop beforereaching my destination. During the trip I may get notications from theFoursquare team about earned badges, such as \"Hey there - Congrats! Yourcheck in to Station Utrecht Centraal just unlocked Photogenic - You found 3places with a photo booth!\" When I reach the ofce I check in again, alwayscurious whether I have lost my mayorship to one of my colleagues who plays thegame and checking if he is on the premises. On my way back I repeat the proce-dure in the reversed order. When I enter my apartment I conclude with checkingin there. Since I am the only one in the house who plays the game I remain theunchallenged mayor. By playing Foursquare I become far more aware of my routinely itinerary to work than I would normally be. I am more conscious of my spatial whereaboutsby playfully being encouraged to weave a spatial story with myself as the mainprotagonist. Furthermore, I am telling my story to others: to the Foursquareteam, to other players of Foursquare and (if I wish) to my friends on Facebook.Conversely other players can tell me their spatial stories and if these players arefriends of mine and we nd ourselves in the same place, our stories may merge byfor instance having a drink together. So Foursquare makes places (as they arecalled on the graphic interface) more like spaces: personal and social landmarksthat are hybrids of objective mapping and subjective touring. Without doubtFoursquare still depends on conventional mapping techniques in the sense that ituses classical cartographical representations, yet as a player I heavily inscribethese layers with my personal \"adventures\". As matter of fact, I can even changethe location of a building on the map or, for example, cheat 19in order to create a more successful and exciting story in which I become the mayor of the NorthPole. 20All of which is made visible to others. In his contribution to this book, media anthropologist Michiel de Lange iden- ties that mobile phone users in Jakarta partly create their social identity byusing their phone as a material item that is put on display for others to see. Having and showing your phone as a material good gives you social prestige and is a playful way to create a social and modern identity. Location-based gameslike Foursquare - judging by the messages shown on Foursquare's website, alsorather popular in Jakarta - put another dimension to the material status thatcomes with mobile phones. Now physical location becomes part of the equation since mobile phone users can tell others where they are and thus create spatialstories as a way to mediate identity. Undoubtedly, a spatial account that containsmore trendy and prestigious places, more sought-after mayorships and moresigns of hooking up with friends, gains you more social prestige than I did on my98 digital cartographies as playful practicestrip to work. As such location-based social network games add a material and locative dimension to smartphones to show and create social identities. In applications like Google Earth or Layar the emphasis lies on what others want to promote as important locations to shape your social identity. To referback to the Layar slogan: they mainly show you things that others want you tosee and go to. Although this component has not vanished from social networkgames, here the accent is put on how you make yourself spatially visible andpowerful in a social network in order to gain social prestige. What both caseshave in common is that as applications they open up possibilities for users/players to employ the visualization of locations to shape their identities. As hasbeen stated by Frissen et al. in this book, they are indeed ne examples of the lud-ication of our culture and demonstrate how digital technologies can open upspaces for shaping and displaying our spatial identities.

Identity - what it is to be and have a self, and to belong to social and cultural groups - is always mediated.People understand themselves, others and their world in terms of the media theyknow and use. According to philosopher Paul Ricoeur, narrative is the privilegedmedium for self-understanding and social/cultural identications. 1The quick and widespread adoption of mobile media technologies prompts us to revisit thisclaim. In this window I look at the context of Jakarta, Indonesia, to show howurban mobile media practices shape identities in playful ways. The mobile phone - or handphone - has rapidly gained popularity in Indone- sia. The number mobile phone subscribers, predominantly prepaid, increasedfrom 3.67 million in 2000 to 159.25 million in 2009 (on a population of 229.96million). 2Reasons include the lagging state of xed telephony at home, its affordability (even for poor people), and the omnipresent branding that inducesan acute sense of \"must have\". Most importantly, mobile phones offer Indone-sians rich new opportunities for identity construction and expression. Mobilemedia hook into existing identity practices that are specic to life in the capitalcity. Jakarta is both a city-world and a world-city. As \"Indonesia in small\",Jakarta reflects the nation's ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. However,Jakarta's urban culture and identity transcends this mosaic. Unlike most otherIndonesian cities, shared symbols, interactions in public and modes of self-pres-entation are not based on the rules of one traditional regional culture. Youngpeople in particular base their identities on shared (though contested) ideasabout what it means to live \"modern life\" in the capital city. Two dening prac-tices are gengsi (the display of prestige) and bergaul (the art of modern socializ- ing). Mobile media technologies have quickly become part of this dynamic101urban culture, and help to dene what it means to be a \"modern Indonesian\". Gengsi, which means \"prestige\" or \"status display\", originally family standing and class. With Soeharto's New Order (1966-1998) economic boom, the notion has shifted from an interior \"innate\" property to an imageachieved by outward appearances. Appearing prestigious involves the posses-sion and display of material goods that symbolically convey progress and cosmopolitanism. The notion regularly recurs in descriptions of Indonesian consumer society in general. 3And it recurs in analyses of Indonesian techno- logical culture, in particular.4Indonesians rarely use gengsi to describe them- selves but frequently ascribe gengsi to other people or to indicate the general Indonesian obsession with conveying impressions through status symbols. Themoral attitude towards gengsi is ambiguous. It is synonymous with consumptive materialistic hedonism and treated with mockery, contempt or concern. It is alsothe measure of a \"modern lifestyle\", and seen as a source of pride and self-worth. 5 Mobile media technologies have become an indispensable part of gengsi. Prestige can be conveyed by the mobile phone as a material artefact. The devicerubs off its prestigious qualities on the individual bearer. Technology journalistBudi Putra says: Indonesians like to possess prestigious devices. Technical specications are not important. The phone is used to express oneself, to make one feel higher. I'd sayfor 80% of people the mobile phone is about gengsi and at most 20% really knows and uses the technology. 6Two editors of Telset, one of the many printed glossies about the mobile phone, explain: [T]he mobile phone has become a kind of benchmark of the individual. The mobile phone is an object you carry with you all the time and can put on dis-play at any moment. It is seen as part of someone's social status. Someone whodoesn't have a mobile phone is thought of as backward. 7 After choosing brand and model the generic stock item must be customized. The phone is dressed up, often in gendered ways. Girls and young women like dan-glers and sleeves. Guys often wear their phone in (fake) leather pockets. A com-mon personalization involves picking a so-called nomor cantik (beautiful num- ber). Regular SIM cards sell for 10,000 rupiah (less than \u00a41). A beautiful numberis usually at least 125,000 rupiah. Exceptionally beautiful numbers sell for 3 mil-lion rupiah or more (\u00a4250 in 2007). A website devoted to selling nomor cantik explains: 102 from your number already intro- duce yourself rst, who you are, before you introduce yourself fully. What people think with the owner phone number of 99999999? The owner mustbe not a common people, he must be an important people. 8 Beautiful numbers may be chosen because they are easy to remember. They canalso carry a specic personal meaning (like one's date of birth), and/or a culturalsignicance. 9Adi, a young marketing sales manager at the largest telecom opera- tor in Indonesia, Telkomsel, reveals another way mobile phone numbers expressgengsi. In Indonesia's low-trust economy, post-paid customers are thoroughlychecked to make sure they are credit-worthy. Telkomsel post-paidnumbers start with the combination 0811. Having such a number reveals onecan afford a post-paid number, and that one is with what is considered the bestand most expensive operator. 10 Physical context matters in handphone-related signiers of prestige. One day Adi showed me around the Telkomsel ofce and the customer area in WismaSlipi, a tall building in west Jakarta. He explained that Telkomsel's \"high valuecustomers\" came there to receive personal assistance. The customer area wasdesigned to make the customers feel valued and important. Telkomsel recentlymoved to a new building and redesigned its interior in a style called \"futuristic\".Indeed, the space has a sterile, \"cool\" quality that is diametrically opposed toJakarta's chaotic, hot and dirty streets. Even queuing up can become part of thedisplay of prestige, Adi continued. It is quiet in the new building because peoplehad to stop by Wisma Slipi and could not be seen by others. When Telkomsel'scustomer service was still located in the nearby Mall Taman Anggrek (one of thebiggest and most luxurious shopping malls in Jakarta), the customer desks werealways busy. People had to wait in long queues, and could be seen by other peo-ple passing by. Many did not have real questions for the service desk, Adi con-ded, but just wanted to appear to belong to Telkomsel's customer base. As Adiand I had a coffee in a small caf\u00e9 downstairs near the exit of the building, hetalked about ofce culture in Jakarta with a generous dose of irony and self-reflection. Adi pointed at the people walking in and out of the building, manywith a communicator-type handphone clinging to their ears. He said there aremany aspiring \"young executives\" who act as if they are very important peopleand wish to appear like successful businessmen. According to Adi, the majorityof those passing by are only pretending. He uses the phrase \"hanya main-main\"(only playing) to describe them. This phrase frequently recurs when people talkabout how the mobile phone is used. Personalizing the phone quite literally changes its character from being an undetermined \"wild\" object to a \"domesticated\" companion tailored to people'sindividual preferences. This is called \"appropriation\" in the domestication103 Michiel de Langeapproach.11In what is called \"conversion\", personalized phones become sym- bolically charged objects that \"speak\" for their owners. These artefacts tell other people who their owners are, and convey the message that they take care of their\"image\". Tamed devices are also tangible everyday reminders to their ownersthat they are in charge of their own lives. Many Indonesians look at themselvesthrough the eyes of others and are acutely aware that they live in an underdevel-oped nation. Reflexivity, or \"the turning-back of the experience of the individualupon himself\", is often forwarded as a distinguishing feature of modern iden-tity. 12Following 32 years of Soeharto rule, the reform period has failed to deliver on its promises. People commonly describe the state of the country as chaos. It issaid that Indonesia is \"still running behind\" and is \"not advanced\". Many feelthat the country as a whole hardly is a source of self-pride. Showing that one iscapable of at least exerting control over one's own life by taming technologicalartefacts offers the individual a much-coveted sense of pride and prestige.Mobile phone gengsi then is not just a sign or symbol of individual progress. It actualizes it. It isthe progress. Through gengsi people distinguish themselves from those who are \"backward\" and seek to distance themselves from the gener-ally deplorable state of the country. This, however, is only one side of the coin.Technologically dened prestige is not solely a centrifugal force but can also be away to identify with collectives. Quite explicit about the potential of technolo-gies to present a modern face of the nation is Elnar (female, 23 years old). Elnarlikes to chat online and get in touch with people on international chat channels.Foreigners often ask her whether Indonesia has many slums. She feels that theyare under the impression that Indonesia is a poor and backward country. Elnarthen tries to explain: \"[I]t is modern here too. We also have factories, our ownairplane, and the internet.\" 13 Handphone gaul The mobile phone is partly a symbolic artefact used for aggrandizing personalprestige. It is also a profoundly social communications medium. Knowing howto use the mobile phone to socialize is part of bergaul, which can be loosely translated as the savoir faire of modern socializing. 14Bergaul consists of creative play with language ( gaul). Bahasa gaul is the trendy language spoken by young people in Jakarta and spread out all over Indonesia. It borrows words from lan-guages spoken in the capital, notably prokem (Jakartan lower-class vernacular), Chinese, and English. It has no xed vocabulary. Mastery of bahasa gaul entails continuously inventing new words and humorously reusing existing expressions.Bergaul is a dynamic collection of \"meta-rules\" informing not only what to say, but also how to say it and to whom, how to move around town, what to buy, etc.One must know how to present oneself and have a view about matters. It means104 from gengsi to gaulknowing what is current, what is \"now\". Moreover, it is showing that one knows through one's speech and demeanour. It is reflexive social play in continu-ous flux, a kind of innite play with its own rules. If gengsi departs from individ- uality and exclusion, bergaul departs from social interactions and inclusiveness. Mild competition in one's self-presentation and the expression of originalityshould never overshadow connecting with other people and playing together.Someone who is too competitive and uses bergaul to increase personal gengsi is seen as arrogant. Newcomers to Jakarta, like young students from all overIndonesia, must quickly familiarize themselves with bergaul in order to link with peers and not to be considered \"backward\" or \"from the village\". Bergaul is an essential social skill required of anyone who seeks to move with ease and con-dence in any situation and to relate to others. There is a lot of gaul talk about the handphone. People share information on the best models and providers among each other and talk about their personalrelation with the phone. Late-night television shows hosted by trendy youngwomen invite viewers to call in and chat on the topic \"have you ever broken yourhandphone?\" A popular blogger's \"meme\" at some point was writing down \"tenthings about my handphone\" and passing these questions on to blogger friends.These were questions about phone brand and type, special number, what wallpa-per, last SMS, where do you wear your phone, and so on. Besides being aresearcher's goldmine, this meme shows how the mobile phone is caught up inbergaul. One cannot just carry any phone. One should be able to explain whyone has this brand, that specic wallpaper, this ringtone. The self-conscious rela-tion to the device informs the relations with others and oneself. In addition to being a topical item, the mobile phone as a communications medium is central to bergaul. Texting in particular offers rich possibilities for lin- guistic play in socializing and self-expression. This is a text message Dewi(female, 25 years old) sent to a male friend: Gw g taw,,c know. Please come directly to Graha Mobicel,Mampang Prapatan Road. I do know something else though. I am free onWednesday, so come along! This message contains several bergaul elements. First, this message is an ad hoc invitation to socialize and join in, without applying too much pressure (\"Please come directly to Graha Mobicel\").16Second, the message is a prelude to a possi-105 Michiel de Langeble physical encounter. Dewi is not very precise about a specic hour and loca- tion and keeps all options open (\"I am free on Wednesday, come along!\"). A fewmore messages will likely be exchanged to ne-tune the actual time and place fora meeting, if it will take place at all. Third, the message jumps into an ongoingconversation that involves multiple people (\"I don't know. Iwan also doesn'tknow\"). Fourth, the message makes creative use of abbreviated SMS language,leaving out vowels and seeking shorter alternatives for common words, andsometimes using words from other languages like English. In English the cin \"c iwan\" is pronounced si Iwan. Siis a denite article used before names of peo- ple one is familiar with. This example parallels mobile communication practices observed elsewhere. In the context of Norwegian teens, the use of the mobile phone to coordinatefuture physical meetings in sequences of increasingly precise communicativeexchanges has been called \"micro-coordination\". 17Mobile communication also involves an expressive dimension of self-presentation and a social dimension ofgroup discussion and agreement, particularly among young people. This hasbeen called \"hyper-coordination\". 18The use of abbreviated and foreign lan- guage in texting has also been widely described in diverse contexts. So if the ele-ments in this example have universal parallels, then what is typically Indonesianabout it? The answer, predictably, is because its language, content and contextare Indonesian. It is an Indonesian expression of individual and group identities.This needs further explication. The message may be written out as follows occur in the message. From standard In- donesian into bahasa gaul, and from bahasa gaul to abbreviated SMS language. In texting almost always the national language is used, often interwoven with Eng-lish words, rather than regional languages. One of the reasons is that Javanese inparticular has an intricate way of establishing and expressing social standing. Nothandy when you try to cram a message into 160 characters. Another reason is thatbahasa Indonesia and international languages are considered more modern. 19 Writing down spoken bahasa gaul itself is a creative play with language. People106 from gengsi to gaulmust make up their own transcriptions, since there is no written standard. Bahasa gaul rarely features in \"ofcial\" institutional publications, like newspapers, books, lm and television subtitles. Written bahasa gaul thrives in informal media where there is a place for the voices of young people themselves: the Internet blog- posts, text messaging, email, and youth magazines that publish letters from read-ers. These media offer play spaces to experiment with alternative youth identities,with bergaul as its shared distinctive feature. Many young people now own a per- sonal communication device that enables them to bypass parental or institutionalsurveillance. The use of bahasa gaul and abbreviated SMS language erects further boundaries. This development is particularly urgent in Indonesian society charac-terized by strong family ties and social hierarchies (not surprisingly, new libertiesafforded by digital media cause reactions of deep moral concerns. However, thatfalls outside the scope of this window). The receiver on the other side also must beable to \"decode\" the message. This encoding/decoding is not merely a way to hidethe content of the message from the prying eyes of parents or schoolteachers. It is ameta-communicative message by which both sides \"perform\" to one anothertheir knowledge and versatility in playing with the rules of bergaul. An individual should be knowledgeable and have opinions worth sharing. Dewi apparentlybroke this rule when she started with \"I don't know.\" But then she corrected her-self, saying: \"I do know something else though.\" This negated her earlier state-ment, and can be interpreted as a reflexive comment on the rules of bergaul itself. According to Ricoeur, storytelling mediates identity via three \"mimetic\" steps. People implicitly preunderstand their lives as composed of narrative ele-ments (mimesis1); they actively construct plotted stories about their lives andthose of others ( mimesis2); and they reflexively understand themselves as narra- tive characters (mimesis3). Narrative identity theory, however, pays no attentionto the conditions under which people tell certain stories. By contrast, a theory of\"playful identities\" takes this reflexivity towards the medium and the mediatingprocess into account. To this end, the threefold mimetics are reworked into\"play1-2-3\". In play1, life's interactions are implicitly understood as playful. In a dialectic between free play and rule-driven game, mobile media at once openup a room of potential to experiment with identity in the display of gengsi and the social play of bergaul, and constrain life with new burdens, like forcibly hav- ing to choose the right model and to always interact in creative ways. In play2, interactions are explicitly congured in playful ways. Sociologists such as ErvingGoffman have pointed out that self-presentation in everyday social interactionsinvolves illusory role-playing. 20In gengsi people playfully express themselves by customizing their phones and engaging in make-believe. In bergaul people engage in witty to-and-fro play with language and context, and deliberate cod-ing and decoding of text messages. In play3, people come to reflexively under- stand themselves and others as playing beings. In the example of people pretend-107 Michiel de Langeing to be businessmen by ostentatiously flaunting their phones, Adi understands the ofce as a stage, the phone as a prop and the people as actors in playful per-formances. Gengsi and bergaul thus foreground reflexive identity mediations via mobile media. People relate to the artefact, to their communication and to theirown play. Mobile phone gengsi plays with the pretence involved in everyday role-playing. Mobile phone bergaul involves an innite metaplay with its own rules. Identities emerge not merely in storytelling \"after the fact\". From the the-atrical performances of the self in gengsi to the social play in bergaul, mobile media technologies shape identities in what theatre theorist Schechner calls aperformative \"showing of a doing\". 21 Notes 1.

It's kind of dusty. There is sand on the ground. To the left and right are stone walls with wooden fences like you couldfind around many houses. In the distance are a road, two high palm trees andsome other types of trees, a telephone pole and some block shaped buildings.The sky is a hazy kind of blue. A train passes between the alley and the build-ings, so part of the road must be a railroad. Carl is in the middle of the image,seen from the back. He wears a pair of blue jeans and a white tank top. He issilent ... There is nothing much to see ... Carl doesn't do anything. It's themoment that we are supposed to take control of Carl's life. 1 In these words Martijn Hendriks describes a crucial turning point in the video - game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. GTA San Andreas is the fth in the Grand Theft Auto series published by Rockstar in 2004. The game starts with an ani- mation explaining how the protagonist, gang member Carl Johnson, returns home after years of living in another city. After being picked up and abused bypolice ofcers, he is left alone in a nondescript back alley. However, in this alley itis not only Carl who is left alone; it is also the player. The gure on the screen nolonger moves on his own accord; he is standing still, lightly swaying. From nowon, the image on the screen has become interactive. Nothing will happen, unlessthe player intervenes. But if he does, what will happen? Interactivity and the rise of the many-to-many This transition from a cinematic to an interactive image is paradigmatic for thechange that has occurred in the way media consumers (viewers or readers or listeners) engage with media objects. Whereas the traditional cultural consumer was a more or less \"passive\" recipient of nished products, such as books, paint-110ings or lms, interactive digital cultural objects like digital games ask their con- sumers to manipulate, enter, explore, perform or even partially create their con-tents. Interactivity has raised the expectation that new media would bring aboutan emancipation of the recipient to an active user or even co-creator. Critics ofthe term, however, have objected that many so-called interactive media objectsmerely allow users to choose between several pre-determined paths or react onthe movements of the cursor, without giving them genuine control over the formor content of the object they deal with. Conversely, the presumed passivity of thereader of a novel or the spectator of a painting or lm might be questioned: asreader's response theories have pointed out, even traditional narrative could notfunction without the active imaginative and cognitive \"lling in\" by the reader. A particularly critical discussion of interactivity has been formulated by media theorist Lev Manovich. All art, classical and modern, he stated, is \"inter-active\" in the sense that it requires the active imaginative and cognitive involve-ment of the recipient. There is a tendency to overlook this fact and to interpret\"interaction\" literally as the pressing of a button, the choosing of a link or themoving of one's body. This identication of a mental process with an objectivelyexisting structure of interactive links ts into a larger trend to externalize mentallife, a trend Manovich discerns in claims of media theorists and psychologistssince the late nineteenth century. Ultimately this identication would serve alogic of control: What to make of this modern desire to externalize the mind? It can be related to the demand of modern mass society for standardization. The subjects haveto be standardized, and the means by which they are standardized need to bestandardized as well. Hence the objectification of internal, private mentalprocesses, and their equation with external visual forms that can easily bemanipulated, mass produced, and standardized on their own. The private andindividual are translated into the public and become regulated. 2 Against the background of these conflicting evaluations, the research pro- gramme Transformations in Perception and Participation: Digital Games aimed to empirically investigate the consequences of the interactive and participatoryfeatures of digital media. Both celebrations of interactive media and criticismslike Manovich's tend to be rather general and abstract. The projects of MaaikeLauwaert, Martijn Hendriks and Ren\u00e9 Glas focused on actual practices, taking aselection of games as cases and analyzing these from a historical, a phenomeno-logical and an ethnographic point of view, respectively. In the course of our research we had to cope with the challenge of studying a rapidly changing eld. Most importantly, we witnessed the fast emergence ofwhat is usually called Web 2.0, a label for online platforms, networks and ser-111 Ren\u00e9e van de Vallvices depending on user-generated content. Web 2.0 seemed to answer (or rather sidestep) some of Manovich's and others' criticisms, re-allocating creativeagency more securely to the user - or more accurately, to the users, in their com-bined and networked plurality. Rather than sending content one-to-one fromindividual sender to individual receiver, like email, or displaying it one-to-manyfrom a single source to many visitors, like a webpage, Wikipedia, YouTube,Flickr, MySpace and Facebook, blogs and Twitter have in common that theyoperate according to a many-to-many model, many users uploading content formany others, who in turn may rate, share, comment or otherwise respond towhat they see, hear or read. Web 2.0's signicance has grown with breathtakingspeed and shifted the emphasis of our investigations away from the individualand experiential to the socio-cultural aspects of digital games. Although thedetailed investigation of concrete examples allows for a nuanced picture com-posed of contrasting tendencies, the overall tenor of our ndings, however, doesnot invalidate Manovich's initial critical stance. Turning the scales? Web 2.0 greatly enhanced the development of what media theorist Henry Jenk-ins has called \"convergence culture\", a culture \"where old and new media col-lide, where grassroots and corporate media intersect, where the power of themedia producer and the power of the media consumer interact in unpredictableways\". 3Within this convergence culture, the active participation of consumers or spectators is indispensable - actually, producers and consumers no longeroccupy separate roles, but \"interact with each other according to a new set ofrules that none of us fully understands\". 4Originating in the fan culture of popu- lar entertainment, the participatory many-to-many model has rapidly spread outover other cultural elds, as Maaike Lauwaert vividly recalls: People can call in on radio shows, email television stations and have their opin- ions read on the news within the same hour. Movie directors consult fan com-munities when considering turning, for instance, the Lord of the Rings trilogy into a movie. Politicians add to their blogs on a daily basis and \"directly\" com-municate through these sites with their voters. The booksellers website Ama-zon publishes reader-written reviews rather than reviews written by paidexperts. Publisher Penguin launched the Penguin Wiki project A Million Pen- guins in 2007, inviting to become writers of a collective novel ... Cosmetics firm Dove motivated its users to create their own Dove publicity campaigns for theCream Oil Body Wash ... 5112 transformations in perception and participationThe list could be extended endlessly. All of a sudden, participation seemed to be everywhere. The emergence of these various examples of \"Youmedia\" has reinvigorated the emancipatory expectations surrounding digital media. At long last the webcould full its original promises and effect a more egalitarian distribution ofpolitical and cultural participation. Manovich's fears would be unwarranted, ascontrol is shifting to the users. Convergence culture harbours a democraticpotential absent in traditional broadcasted media, according to Jenkins: people\"take media in their own hands\" and live their lives and relationships, do theirwork, educate and entertain themselves through and across multiple mediachannels. 6Jenkins acknowledges that participation is not evenly distributed - convergence is at the same time a top-down, corporate-driven process and a bot-tom-up, consumer-driven process - yet he is hopeful about the democratic possi-bilities of this participatory culture, stressing its empowering potential. Like-wise, William Uricchio has argued that peer-to-peer media practices like fanction sites, blogs, music le exchanges or collaborative news networks, thatexist \"thanks to the creative contributions, sharing, and active participation oftheir members\", could possess a radical potential to the extent that they con-tribute to the \"claiming and expanding of rights\" and the \"creation of newmeanings\". 7According to Jean Burgess et al., \"the interweaving of everyday life, creative content production and social life\" that is characteristic of digital cul-ture has enabled unexpected forms of creativity and engagement with bothintended and unintended social and cultural consequences. 8 Other theorists are less optimistic.9They hold that there are still huge differ- ences when it comes to access to digital media, which reinforce existing inequali-ties related to class, race, gender, age and geographical location. Moreover,among those who have access there is a participation gap between people withdifferent degrees of mastery of the cultural protocols and practices of the mediainvolved, differentiating - to use a notion of Manuel Castells - between the inter- acting - those who are able to select their multidirectional circuits of communi- cation - and the interacted - those who are provided with a restricted number of pre-packaged choices. 10Although Internet access through mobile appliances is rapidly increasing and software is more and more user friendly, it is questionablewhether this will result in an explosion of grassroots creativity. Research showsthat only a small percentage of visitors of user-generated content sites actuallycreates new content; the vast majority (approximately 80%) consist of passivereaders or viewers. 11 But even if participation was distributed more equally, these criticisms point out, it is questionable whether this would necessarily mean power sharing ortaking control. It has been argued that rather than being potentially subversive,participatory practices would contribute to a more fluid assimilation of users113 Ren\u00e9e van de Vallinto the online economy and the penetration of everyday private and social life by the logic and power relations of capitalism.12Writing about earlier genera- tions of Internet platforms, Manuel Castells has argued that precisely because ofthe interactivity, diversication and flexibility of the new media, the networkedintegration of multiple communication modes enhances the absorption of allforms of cultural expression into the same symbolic environment in which thedistinctions between different types of contents and codes are blurred andadapted to a pervasive cultural logic in which entertainment value is predomi-nant. 13With regard to the expectation that Web 2.0 platforms and peer-to-peer cultural practices would change this logic and stimulate new forms of creativity,Lev Manovich has (again) voiced some doubts: Given that the significant percentage of user-generated content either follows the templates and conventions set up by the professional entertainment indus-try, or directly re-uses professionally produced content, ... does this mean thatpeople's identities and imagination are now even more firmly colonized bycommercial media than in the twentieth century? ... Indeed, if the twentiethcentury subjects were simply consuming the products of culture industry, 21 st century prosumers and \"pro-ams\" are passionately imitating it. That is, theynow make their own cultural products that follow the templates established bythe professionals and/or rely on professional content. 14 Furthermore, the effects of interaction and participation would be restricted in scope: although media producers like television companies or the game industrymay welcome the contributions of viewers or players, their impact seldom affectsthe actual set-up, rules or ideology of the programme or the game. 15Ultimately, it would be the established media producers that prot, as Ian Bogost claims:\"Even if we accept Jenkins's claim that the interpretive interests of fan communi-ties undermine the intentions of mass media, they still support the nancial inter-ests of mass media. For consolidated media, convergence mitigates nancialrisk.\" 16As Jos\u00e9 van Dijck and others have observed, rather than a shift of power from media corporations to \"users like you\", \"user participation\" entails theprotable exploitation of unpaid labour, commercial companies gladly using thecreativity of amateurs, not to mention the wealth of consumer data users volun-tarily or involuntarily provide to media companies and other businesses. 17 The games of stake in the geographies of play How does the world of toys, play and games t into this picture? Digital gamesare an outstanding testing ground for probing the possibilities and limits of theparticipatory potential of the many-to-many model. Games are a fast-growing114 transformations in perception and participationand highly protable economic sector; global revenues were estimated to amount to US$30 billion in 2006;18in 2009, sales in the United States alone amounted to US$10.5 billion.19The games industry is at the forefront not only in terms of technological innovation but also in terms of marketing strategies.Moreover, the cultural signicance of digital games extends far beyond theboundaries of mere entertainment, as games are used as tools in various sectorslike education, policy development and urban planning, and have already beenmarked as the training ground for informational capitalism's labour force.According to The Economist: Games are widely used as educational tools, not just for pilots, soldiers and sur- geons, but also in schools and businesses ... Anyone who has learned to play ahandful of games can generally figure out how to operate any high-tech device.Games require players to construct hypotheses, solve problems, develop strate-gies, and learn the rules of the in-game world through trial and error. Gamersmust be able to juggle several tasks, evaluate risks and make quick decisions ...Playing games is, thus, an ideal form of preparation for the workplace of the21st century, as some forward-thinking firms are already starting to realise. 20 On the other hand, many games - in particular, massively multiplayer online games - are being surrounded by vibrant player communities and cultures,gamers actively contributing to their game's development. Gamers are very cre-ative in inventing ways of avoiding, transforming, surpassing or transgressingthe intended uses of games. 21As the game industry is rather concentrated and huge nancial and commercial interests are at stake, this raises all kinds of fric-tions about ownership and control between players and game companies, whichhave been analyzed by Maaike Lauwaert in terms of \"changing ofplay\" Glas in terms of \"games of stake\". 22 In the examples they have investigated, the adoption of many-to-many model has been initiated by the games' producers. In the case of LEGO, for instance,innovations were largely manufacturer-driven until the beginning of the twenty-rst century. Players could accept or reject innovations, but that was as far astheir influence went. But then LEGO changed its policies, bringing fans into thecompany, learning from fan cultures and taking over user-invented innovations.In this way Mindstorms, a digital game consisting of computational LEGO bricks that allow the player to create her own robots, has proted greatly fromplay practices in which users appropriated and recongured the game's tools andcontents for their own purposes, the LEGO company in turn tapping into the fancommunity's knowledge and culture to develop a new edition. The companyactively supports user communities and consults Mindstorms fans and, vice versa, LEGO employees take part in user groups and engage in fan activities. 115 Ren\u00e9e van de VallLikewise, the digital games SimCity and The Sims rely heavily on player-gener- ated content. In the case of The Sims 1, co-creation by players was even planned by the creators from the beginning and part of the game's development and mar- keting strategy. In the process of developing, testing and launching The Sims On- line, however, publisher Maxis learnt the price of disregarding the users' input.The game was released without paying attention to the criticisms of the betatesters and players could not import user-generated content into the game. Be-cause playing the game was often tedious and time-consuming, players engaged inunwanted practices like the introduction of cheating bots, which in the context ofa multiplayer online game soon amounts to antisocial behaviour. \"Players did notdesign with the game, nor for the game but against the game.\" 23Introduced in 2002, the game was closed in 2008. Co-creation, then, can happen along more indirect lines than gamers being explicitly involved in the design process. Players have impact on the game bytheir ways of playing. Many players will play the game as intended by the design-ers, but unintended, divergent and even transgressive modes of playing aboundand may eventually result in changes in the game's design. Unintended co-creation happened for instance when Sims publisher Maxis decided to facilitate the unexpected use of a documentation tool for the crafting of stories. Not alltypes of divergent play activity have been welcomed by Maxis though - nudepatches, for instance, have been discouraged. The same goes for World of Warcraft, a massively multiplayer online role- playing game (MMORPG) counting 12 million players. World of Warcraft is not published as a xed and denite product: it is constantly changing, both throughuse by its players and through maintenance and upgrading by its corporate own-ers. What the game is and how it is played is subject to what Glas calls \"games ofstake\", processes of negotiation between stakeholders with sometimes highlyconflicting perceptions and interests - between publisher Blizzard Entertainmentand specic groups of players as well as between different groups of players. The tyranny of the algorithm Both Lauwaert and Glas found that players' agency over the games is very lim-ited. Control over the game is rst of all determined by the game's technology,rules and ction. Both the possibilities for play and the game world in which thegame takes place are shaped in advance by the technology that carries the gamein terms of hardware and software. As the rules of the game are programmedand therefore xed, and the computer acts as an automated referee followingalgorithms, the only way to negotiate the basic rules and structures of the game isby nding loopholes, design flaws or faults. Glas points out how in the case ofWorld of Warcraft the computer acts as a representative of publisher Blizzard as116 transformations in perception and participationa stakeholder within the game, pushing players into intended play practices and limiting the possibilities for other strategies. Although players can form personalstories for their characters by choosing what quests to pursue in which order,their action radius is limited to what the game allows (one can pass through gatesbut not cross mountains) and their actions have no lasting impact on the gameworld as such. It is Blizzard that continues the games' narrative by publishingnew patches. When players nevertheless engage in undesired behaviour, two sig-nicant contracts that players have to accept in order to get access to the game,the End-User Licence Agreement and the Terms of Use, allow Blizzard to expelthem from the game. Likewise, Lauwaert stresses that the feedback mechanisms of SimCity informing you about the consequences of your actions are beyond the player'scontrol. These basic features embody highly ideological meta-narratives, as notonly objects are simulated but social and economic processes as well. Buildingpolice stations in SimCity, for instance, will cause the criminal rates to drop and the property values to rise. The player cannot modify the relations between thesevariables because they are encoded in the software and inaccessible. HenceLauwaert speaks of the \"tyranny of the algorithm\". While new media technologies enlarge play worlds and create new play possi- bilities (such as the option to incorporate user-generated content in a game),they also constrain. For example, the Realpolitik principles of SimCity (or the consumerist ideology of The Sims ... ) are unalterable. 24 Divergent play practices However, players are not without power or agency. Within limits, players can engage in divergent play practices or adjust the user interface with player-createdmodications. They can reduce the enormous amount of time and effort neededto play the game with the help of walk-throughs and strategy guides. Some play-ers of World of Warcraft engage in \"speedrunning\", advancing through the game as fast as possible while recording the gameplay on video as proof. Anotherdeviant play practice is \"twinking\", the boosting of a low-level character's per-formance by supplying it with the wealth or power accumulated by a high-levelone. A third example of players' agency is the implementation of player-createduser interface modications for organizing, monitoring and improving perform-ance in group raids. What these playing modes have in common is that they dis-play what Glas calls a form of \"hyperproductive deviation\": by internalizing thegame's instrumental rules, strategies and mechanics they go beyond the intendeddesign and \"game the game itself\", thereby downplaying its narrative and role-playing dimensions. 25117 Ren\u00e9e van de VallWhereas the above-mentioned practices were possible without breaking any contractual or coded rules, there are others that transgress these boundaries, like Real Money Trade (RMT), the buying and selling of virtual currency or items forreal money, which is explicitly forbidden by publisher Blizzard. RMT can alsoinvolve the acquisition of farm bots, software programmes that play the gamefor you, and gold-farming, employing low-wage workers in sweat shops to dothe same. Players do not agree on the desirability of these practices. For some,paying someone else to carry out boring playing operations is as acceptable aspaying for services in real life; for others it runs contrary to the way the gameis supposed to be played. In one case, an American player even led a lawsuitagainst gold seller business IGE without waiting for Blizzard to act, complainingthat IGE \"polluted the entertainment\". 26 Another potentially transgressive activity is the creation of so-called \"ma - chinima\" productions, lms made by players using the game's software.Machinima movies seek to expand the boundaries of the game's ctional world.In general, players' agency over the ctional world is limited, as it is Blizzardthat determines how the game's narrative unfolds. However, the emotionalinvestment players have in the ctional universe is often great, and some changesby Blizzard caused a lot of discontent in the gaming community. Players them-selves also like to write and rewrite parts of the narrative and create lms inwhich their characters perform roles. It is questionable whether these ctionalappropriations are, as Jenkins holds, forms of \"tactical resistance\". Somemachinima productions purposefully challenge established norms and expec-tations. The majority, however, conform to the supposed expectations of theintended audience. Conflicts may also arise between players. Glas witnessed how a new release by the publisher led to struggles between different player groups because the newcontent was not equally accessible to all players but only for the most hardcoreraiding guilds. In other words, a major event - the opening of the gates to a newpart of the ctional world - had been reserved for a limited selection of partici-pants. What had hitherto been a stable community broke apart when some play-ers were attributed with more power than others. Clearly, the community lackedthe means to negotiate power asymmetries and govern itself. Typically, conflicts like these only involve very dedicated and active players. The great majority of World of Warcraft's paying customers consist of more casual players whose wishes can differ from those of the highly vocal, activeusers. The percentage of players who engage in creative contribution on the web-sites surrounding the game is about 30%. That is higher than the 90-10-1 rule ofuser participation Nielsen identied for social networks and communities (90%are lurkers, 10% contribute from time to time, 1% account for most creativecontributions), but far too low to assume that the distinction between consumers118 transformations in perception and participationand producers has become irrelevant. As many consumers do not seem to wish for more agency, the opposition between top-down or bottom-up forces mightbe misleading: \"[W]e should be hesitant with identifying power over the game aseither a (negative) top-down or (positive) bottom-up force - many consumersdesire to be controlled and governed by the producers of their leisure pastime ofchoice.\" 27 Commodification and instrumentalization LEGO Mindstorms, SimCity, The Sims and World of Warcraft exemplify the commercially successful incorporation of the many-to-many model by the indus-try for the development and merchandizing of its products. This comes at aprice, however. As Lauwaert points out: Since game developers increasingly rely on and tap into what goes on in the \"can\" culture of user-driven innovations and allow for the fast traffic betweenperiphery and core, peripheral play practices are increasingly commodified andseem to be less and less divergent. Players have taken on the role of co-designer,and what they produce is very much in line with the company's discourse. 28 The adaptations and appropriations of players of The Sims, for instance, never stray very far from the game's overall port\u00e9 of a suburban lifestyle based on con- sumer bliss.29 Whereas in the commercial context of the toys and game industry the many- to-many culture tends to become commodied, another tendency can be noted when it is introduced in the context of policy development: its instrumentaliza-tion. Lauwaert analyzes the serious urban game Face Your World, a mixed-media participation process with a photorealistic 3D design software applica-tion, the Interactor, at its core. Face Your World was created and used for public participation in the design of a public park in the Amsterdam neighbourhoodSlotervaart. The project aimed at including user groups that are usually less visi-ble in municipal politics, like children and immigrant women. Lauwaert con-cludes that although the project was fairly successful in broadening the range ofparticipants and producing a community-supported park design, its democraticpotential was limited. \"The largest chunk of power is in the hands of thosedesigning policies and tools for exercising democracy and deciding when, underwhat terms and conditions and in which format to involve the public.\" 30More- over, the use of serious games in urban planning contexts affects one of the basicqualities of play, its ludic inconsequentiality. 31Lauwaert observes how the trivi- ality or purposelessness of the ludic tends to become compromised when playhas to serve an exterior goal: when children used the chat function of the game119 Ren\u00e9e van de Vallfor purposeless chatting rather than communicating about the design, the func- tion was abolished. Glas remarks: The fact that serious urban games are serious, meaning that their goal and function are not to amuse but to achieve something within the \"real world\",further erodes the autonomy of the periphery without increasing its influenceover the core ... The many-to-many culture is not commodified so much asinstrumentalized in this serious context. 32 It should be noted here that play is an ambiguous phenomenon: it is both rule- bound and free, open and closed, experimental and coded, immersive and self-reflexive. Play, as Roger Caillois noted, hovers between the poles of paidia and ludus. Where paidia stands for \"a primary power of improvisation and joy\", for \"an almost indivisible principle, common to diversion, turbulence, free improvi-sation, and carefree gaiety\", manifesting \"a kind of uncontrolled fantasy\", ludus is \"the taste for gratuitous difculty\", the tendency to bind paidia's exuberance \"with arbitrary, imperative, and purposely tedious conventions\" and requiringan \"ever greater amount of effort, patience, skill and ingenuity\". 33Every game (and every single performance of the same game) strikes its own balance betweenthese two poles but none is exclusively the one or the other. With regard to theinstrumentalization and commodication of play - which we might relate to apredominance of its \"ludic\" pole - we should recall that whenever \"play\" hasbeen endowed with a benecial, liberating, creative and even critical potential inmodern (and also postmodern) Western thought, ranging from Kant via Schillerto Huizinga, Gadamer, Caillois, Winnicott and its irre-ducible and irrepressible, \"anarchic and capricious nature\". We might concludethat whereas the introduction of game formats in serious realms like that ofurban policy could mean that the \"real world\" is becoming somewhat moreplayful, it is at the price of play losing a basic feature of its playfulness. If thegames studied in our project are exemplary for a more general trend, this wouldmean that in the course of the so-called \"ludication of culture\" a primary cul-tural resource tends to become domesticated. 34 Colonization from without and within? The picture that emerges from Lauwaert's and Glas' research suggests that theparticipatory tendencies in contemporary media culture - as exemplied by thehighly visible and influential game sector - do not full the promises of userempowerment and creative engagement. Although the many-to-many approachentails - and even requires - paying serious attention to gamers' wishes, playpractices and creative contributions, it is the industry that determines the limits120 transformations in perception and participationof their agency. Glas agrees with new media theorists like Jenkins that the tradi- tional distinction between consumer and producer has disintegrated. Yet at thesame time he warns that [t]he concept of \"convergence culture\" is in danger of overstating the eagerness of producers to allow full collaboration of users in creative processes. Whilethe roots of participatory culture in online social networks like virtual worldscan be traced back to grassroots and \"DIY\" [Do-It-Yourself] counterculture,participation is now embedded in and entangled with corporately owned con-trol spheres. Game developers appropriate players' creative productions, turning users' par- ticipatory engagement into unpaid labour.35 Control is not only exercised explicitly through vertical chains of ownership and command. Lauwaert and Glas point to the scripted and automated forms ofcontrol users voluntarily subject themselves to in order to take part in many-to-many media. Compared with other media like books, lm or television, playinggames is denitely more participatory. In fact, games - digital or not - are partic-ipatory per denition. Compared to offline games, however, players of digitalgames may have less room to adapt these games to their wishes and try out vari-ations in content or design. Digitalization furthermore affects the freedom ofplayers to negotiate the game's rules, as enforcement of the rules has shifted tothe \"tyranny of the algorithm\". Finding loopholes, design flaws or faults in thegame in order to negotiate the rules requires a high degree of skilfulness. Themany-to-many culture does make a difference, as players produce walk-throughs and modications that can be used by other, less savvy players. On theother hand, some of these productions lead to new forms of technologicallymediated control by the player community. Glas points to the fact that theplayer-created user interface modications for organizing group raids not onlydictate the norms for play (they become obligatory for members of a raidingguild), but also create a voluntary and distributed system of social control, asthey monitor each player's activity and make it visible to all other members ofthe guild. As games are increasingly used for serious purposes, moreover, there is good reason to question the role computer games play in contemporary informationsociety's regulatory mechanisms. In spite of its apparent egalitarian dependenceon peer-to-peer participation, convergence culture is not without its techniquesof power. As Alexander Galloway has argued, the emerging form of control inthe age of the Internet is not the discipline imposed by a bureaucratically andhierarchically organized centre and internalized by its subjects, but a far moreflexible style of management exerted through the operation of \"protocol\". \"A121 Ren\u00e9e van de Valltechnique for achieving voluntary regulation within a contingent environment\", protocol is the fluid type of power mechanism suited for the distributed net-works of the many-to-many model. 36Originally meaning \"any type of correct or proper behaviour within a specic system of conventions\", in the digital era ithas come to denote the sets of prescriptions and rules describing the standardsgoverning the implementation of specic technologies. Most characteristicallyexemplied by network protocols like TCP/IP (Transmission Control Proto-col/Internet Protocol), this procedural type of control is independent from con-tent and therefore adaptable to a great diversity of situations. With its inherent and compelling bias towards standardization and con- formism, protocol might form the rear side of convergence culture's celebrationof participation and playful creativity. Its flexibility and non-hierarchical organi-zation mark protocol as dening a new type of power, summarized in Deleuze'sdescription of \"control societies\". 37Power in this type of society is not exerted by means of top-down commands, but inscribed into the rules that enable thesocietal systems' functioning and are willingly adopted by their participants.Digital games are paradigmatic for this type of control, according to Galloway:\"they don't attempt to hide informatic control; they flaunt it\", \"making it co-ter-minous with the entire game\". 38As such, they train players in the kind of skills that are required for a smooth functioning in society at large, where - just like ingames - you learn the rules by working out what works or not. Just like the gameindustry adopts successful user modications in order to improve their product,originally sub- or counter-cultural practices like game cultures tend to becomeabsorbed in the smooth operation of this protocol culture. From participation to interpassivity The strength of Galloway's analysis, like Jenkins' for that matter, is that it sub-sumes a great diversity of cultural phenomena under a striking and elucidatingconcept. At the same time, this is also its main weakness as it hardly allows forany differentiation. How digital media objects are scripted only partially deter-mines their actual use; different types of protocols may clash or function nextto each other; and viewed from an offline perspective players' practices may befar more diversied than even close virtual ethnographic observation mightreveal. Both Lauwaert and Glas emphasize that current research on participatory media (including their own) tends to be inherently biased as it foregrounds activeparticipants and neglects hardly-active or even non-active users. This is not onlya methodological matter. There is enough evidence to justify a suspicious stancetowards the distribution of agency and control in the participatory culture ofconvergence. Recalling Lev Manovich's critical remarks on interactivity as the122 transformations in perception and participationexternalization and standardization of private mental life, we might question the positive value usually attached to users' engagement with, participation in andagency over the media objects they encounter. In Lauwaert's words: What if you do not care about MySpace and being LinkedIn? What if you do not want to post your every thought to a personal blog nor feel the need toleave your ramblings as tags over the Internet? What if you have nothing toshare or nothing you want to share? What if you do not see the purpose of chat-ting with political wannabes or voting for this statement or against that one?What if you do not want to film your friends acting weird and post it onYouTube or find your old classmates again and chat with them? 39 What if, indeed? What explains the strong pull towards engagement? What are the consequences if you don't join convergence culture's participatory media?What happens if you do? Here Martijn Hendriks' research ties in again, as he questions digital culture's supposed interactivity, starting from an analysis of the game Grand Theft Auto, agame both criticized and praised because it engages the player in performing actsof brutal and senseless violence. Drawing from the theories on ofRobert Pfaller, whether thissupposedly interactive engagement would not be better characterized as an inter-passive outsourcing of agency and emotional responses. Interpassivity denotesthose situations in which a media object does something for us that we normallycould only do ourselves and takes care of its own reception. Examples are\"canned laughter\", when watching a TV comedy we hear an invisible audiencelaugh \"for us\", or recording a lm on our video recorder as a substitute for actu-ally viewing it. Playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas harbours some of these same mecha- nisms, according to Hendriks. In the same way in which the canned laughter ofsitcoms enjoys \"for us\", GTA's main character Carl Johnson's \"canned anger\"enacts for us responses of frustration, rage or desire for revenge. When we movethis gure through the city and through him steal cars or gun down cops andpassers-by, it is Carl who tells the people that \"we\" killed that they owe it tothemselves or asks whether they would like some more. Carl likes what he isdoing and enables us to like it through him. Yet interpassivity is marked by anambiguous relation between the machine and the person for whom a response isperformed: the laughter is and is not \"ours\". Likewise, rather than completelyidentifying with the violent acts that Carl Johnson performs, the player distanceshimself in the same act through which he engages with what happens on thescreen. Hendriks' analysis makes us question oppositions like activity and passivity,123 Ren\u00e9e van de Vallreality and ction, or agency and control that structure current discussions about participatory culture and search for more subtle distinctions. Hendriksobserves how the interpassive logic of outsourcing is also at work in a typicalmany-to-many platform like Facebook, which promises to take care of, performand enjoy our friendships for us. We click a button and Facebook \"likes\" ourfriends' photographs or reports. Clicking another, we \"attend\" an event withoutgoing there but showing the whole world that we could have. Facebook exter-nalizes, represents and formats our social life, which can continue without oureven being present: Our own status updates, comments and likes will simply keep on circulating as long as others also comment or like the same things, and our Facebook profilewill still be there to represent us, showing others who we are in the form of a listof our friends, interests and mental states. And it goes through the arduous taskof finding out what's going on among our friends. Through processes that arebeyond our immediate control (presumably sifting through factors such as thenumber of responses on a status update or the number of mutual friends), itchooses to focus on certain threads of conversations or certain status updatesfor us while neglecting others. 40 We are there, even when we aren't, but even when we are, we are not - and so are our friends. Our social life proceeds through automated and simulated activitiesand responses the machine performs and enjoys \"for us\". Formatting friendshipthrough a limited array of standardized options and regulating it through algo-rithmically operating procedures, we could surmise that Facebook has suc-ceeded in subsuming even our most private attachments into the realm of proto-col control. Yet it would be as erroneous to see Facebook as a substitute forsociality as it would be to dismiss it as a mere semblance of it. Facebook's reme-diation of friendship results in a symbolic reality that attracts because it is realand ctitious at the same time. 41Hovering between exhibitionist performance and genuine keeping in touch, the world of Facebook friendship is a reality par-ticipants both do and do not identify with. The ambiguity of interpassive engagement indicates that the questions whether users of new media are active co-creators or not, or whether users havecontrol or are being manipulated, are much too crude. Rather than oppose thosewho participate to those who don't, or creative contributors against passiverecipients, we should look for more complex patterns and dynamics of engage-ment, allowing for the possibility that even the most hyperactive players remainpassively disengaged in some respects and mere \"lurkers\" in some sense create.The dissociation Hendriks observes even in an immersive interactive game likeGrand Theft Auto might form a protection against becoming completely colo-124 transformations in perception and participationnized and keep open the capacity for playing with, rather than merely playing, the game. Therefore Lauwaert's question (\"What if you don't want to participate in the online world?\") can also be read in a different sense. The danger of studying media objects (games, websites, social networks) from a perspective that startswith these media objects and then traces their uses, is that they seem potentiallyomnipresent, all determining and exclusive. Against the tendencies discussedabove, towards externalization, standardization, and protocol control, we mightstress that people never completely coincide with their roles as media users. 42 What we tend to call \"users\" or \"players\" are not merely \"users of\" or \"playersof\" - Facebook or World of Warcraft or whatever - but (unless they are really very addicted) at the same time university students, football players, daughters,guitarists, cat lovers and mainstreet shoppers. They might be active on Hyvesand at the same time occasional LinkedIn users; now and then playing a digitalgame but being hooked on Scrabble (or the other way around); be a non-creative YouTube watcher but painting landscapes in oil when on holiday. The impact ofparticipatory media on the agency and creativity of users can only truly bejudged if the perspective is reversed and we investigate how flesh and blood\"people like you\" handle all these different media - or not. Just like interactivityhas its (inter)passive moments, indifference towards participatory online cultureis not necessarily a sign of \"passivity\". What indeed. 1.

The creative productions under dis-cussion in this case study display free rather than instrumental play in its mostoutspoken form: players do not play the game to beat its goal-oriented content,but instead seek ways to expand or in other ways manipulate the ctional world,or try to nd the edges of what is possible in the game's design in terms of the cod-ed rules and boundaries. These productions do not always conform to what thedesigners - and other players - consider acceptable forms of appropriation of thevirtual world and its ction. It makes this case study as much a discussion on fancreation as one on game design exploitation, both of which can lead to creativeand in some cases legal differences between players and World of Warcraft's de-veloper, Blizzard Entertainment. 2 Looking the other way As a stakeholder directly beneting from a committed and involved gamer com-munity (active players stick to a game longer, which means larger revenue), Bliz-zard is well-known for nurturing player creativity. The company has set up a fansites programme, which brings out reports on community news and player-organized events and hosts many examples of fan art on their ofcial site along-side its own artwork. Throughout the years, they have also hosted fan ction128and art contests, some of which were oriented towards machinima lms. The way Blizzard promotes machinima lm-making has nevertheless remainedsomewhat vague in terms of the affordances players are allowed. Even though many machinima and other non-ction player-created videos (like recordings of raids, player-versus-player action or walk-throughs) havebeen around since and well before World of Warcraft's release in 2004, Blizzardpublished their rst ofcial endorsement information dedicated to makingmachinima only in September 2007. The stated goal of the information was to\"nurture the advancement and growth of this young artistic community\" and to\"say with resounding clarity: Blizzard is a fan of your works\". 3It is made clear, however, that the information should be considered as a \"guide for fair-use videocreation: a new reference document which outlines the rules and guidelines thatshould be followed when crafting your videos\". 4The guide assists in helping to \"avoid 'grey area' decisions for which there is no denitive answer out there forwhether a course of action is permissible or not according to Blizzard\". 5This \"grey area\" as well as the rules and guidelines provided to avoid getting therereveal Blizzard's stakes regarding machinima moviemaking. Machinima artistsmay use a game like World as what Lowood calls a \"found technol- ogy\" to produce new creations but are not allowed to fully appropriate thegame. 6While the guide stresses that it wants to assist machinima lm-makers to \"provide inspiration and show what the art form is truly capable of achieving\",including creating machinima for educational purposes or sending them in forconsideration to lm festivals, there are nevertheless very clear \"don'ts\" lm-makers should avoid; for instance, commercial use, R-rated content, or morethan \"10 seconds total of sponsor promotion per production\". 7 It took Blizzard a relatively long time to set up the machinima fair-use guide, something which might be explained by examining Blizzard's rather ambiguousrelationship with the lm form - a relationship which was not wholly solvedthrough the fair-use guide they eventually published. The reason is this: in orderto make more ambitious machinima like Tales of the Past III , players often make use of third-party programmes and private servers enabling them more creativefreedom than is allowed by the core game. In contrast to prior games famous forthe machinima creations they spawned, rst-person shooters like the Quake and Half-Life series, World of Warcraft does not allow for modication beyond the user interface. The possibility to modify a game partly or entirely through openinstead of closed game design is seen as one of the driving forces behind the riseof machinima in the mid- to late 1990s. 8In World of Warcraft such practices are in violation of the Terms of Use and are thus forbidden. An example of a third-party programme used to make World of Warcraft machinima is the WoW Machinima Tool, written by Mads Hagbarth Lund (aliasMalu05). It gives machinima artists access to up to ten fully controllable in-game129 Ren\u00e9 Glascameras, time control (changing from day to night), weather control (instant rain if needed), expanded animations for characters and the ability to spawnNPCs and objects which can also be animated at will. None of these optionsexist in the main game software and can be readily considered an exploitation ofthe game's design. We should be hesitant in calling such exploitative appropriation a form of resistance. With many games, the modication of games using tools like the onedescribed above are, as game scholar Robert Jones points out, \"part of theintended use of the product - as indicated by the source code being made avail-able to gamers\". 9In the case of World of Warcraft, with its closely guarded source code, modication beyond the user interface is, however, certainly notthe intended use of the product, making a programme like the WoW MachinimaTool a potentially resistive force. In many cases, machinima lm-making using private servers and modication tools can nevertheless be considered involuntary rather than deliberate forms ofresistance. The creator of the WoW Machinima Tool is fully aware that his pro-gramme does not sit well with World of Warcraft 's exploitation policy: It ONLY uses simple direct memory modification to gain acces to its features and abbility to change variables in the game memory. It does not use any form of code/dll injection or attempt to call functions in any other way. It currently acceses playerbase, playercam, speccam, worldtime and weather soon too. Tool does not alter any gameplay related fea- tures....From an Ethical point of view this application still does violate the Terms ofUse. However not the bottom line for the policy itself. But help machinimaauthors to express Azeroth and beyond, and thereby help other players \"men-tally\" explore it on 2nd hand. 10 Even though the aim of the tool is to give machinima audiences the possibility to explore Warcraft's ctional universe indirectly through the medium of lm, andto provide machinima lm-makers more means of expression, the tools could be used by those with a view to exploit or cheat. Fearing this, Lund states that he is\"still not 100% sure\" whether he should keep the project open source, \"since Iknow it in the end can cause more damage than good for a project like this\". Heconcludes his discussion on the tool's legal status with an open question address-ing Blizzard: \"I respect any word from Blizzard about this project and will takeany word to consideration.\" 11 Blizzard's fair-use guide does not provide all the answers the World of War- craft machinima scene is looking for and the company could even be said to con-130 machinimatradict itself in the way it approaches machinima. It makes no mention of using third-party programmes or other technical means which violate the terms of use.In 2006, before they published their machinima guide, Blizzard co-sponsored amachinima competition with up to $10,000 in prize money. All movies could beentered, provided that they comply with the entry rules, most of them compara-ble with those stated in the game's EULA (no profanity/obscenity, no unautho-rized use of copyrighted material, no derogatory characterization of any personor group on age, race, gender and so forth). No mention was made about usingthird-party programmes, but the contenders, among which the elaborately madeand ultimately winning comedy Illegal Danish - Super Snacks , could not have been made without them. 12Martin Falch, creator of the popular World of War- craft machinima Tales of the Past III, recognizes this situation from the Blizzard- organized Blizzcon community events:13 Blizzard's claim on one hand (and even stated so ... to some other authors), that they'll \"hunt down\" people using private servers for machinimas or peopleusing third party programs, even those using modelviewer, 14that extract files from WoW - while at the same time, each and every single category winner in both this year's Blizzcon and that of last year's were made using modelviewerand a lot of them using private servers. 15 What we see here is a situation where Blizzard as a stakeholder allows, even sponsors a violation of their own Terms of Use policies. Outside of the fewmachinima contests they organized or sponsored, Blizzard tends to have no of-cial opinion about individual machinima projects due to this contradictory situ-ation, instead opting for a general endorsement of machinima as a creativeprocess. Even though Tales of the Past III has an audience of over a million play- ers, Falch was never publicly acknowledged for this achievement by Blizzard. AsFalch explains: \"[T]hing is, I use private servers and extract their MPQ les etc,things that are against their EULA - basically they can't ofcially complementmy movies, since they'd have a huge community uproar as to why I can use pri-vate servers while others aren't allowed to.\" 16To prevent community unrest and to keep the machinima scene intact as an important pillar of the game's partici-patory culture, Blizzard keeps silent about the practices going on behind thescenes of machinima making. In the process, machinima makers are left in thedark about what they are and are not allowed to do. By remaining vague or ambiguous about what is allowed and what is not, Bliz- zard has created a situation where they can act, or refrain from acting, at their owndiscretion when they disapprove of certain machinima productions. In the nextcase study, I discuss a machinima which crosses the line between what is deemedacceptable by Blizzard, both on the levels of game design and game contract. 131 Ren\u00e9 GlasExploration or exploitation Not all machinima aim to present fan ction set in World of Warcraft's ctional universe. Machinima publication platforms like Warcraftmovies.com host many other types of video productions, ranging from recordings of play sessions, towalk-throughs and much more. Such lms have their historical roots in thereplay culture of real-time strategy games (including the original Warcraft games) and the demo scenes of early rst-person shooters, and they are usuallyof little interest for those viewers who are not also players. Those who are inter-ested in these videos, says Lowood, \"watch them incessantly as a means forbringing detached analysis to bear on the improvement of their own skills andstrategies\". 17On Warcraftmovies.com, less than 10% of all submitted lms are \"traditional\" narrative-based machinima, while the rest are recordings of in-game performances. 18 Not all machinima or related video productions are in line with Blizzard's EULA or fair-use guide. You can, for example, nd parodies of real real-life brands with World of Warcraft-oriented humour, Warcraft-themed remakes of music videos, or mischievous lms showing nude charactersin various stages of implied sexual conduct. In some cases, Blizzard acts onmachinima of which they do not approve. One of the machinima types Blizzard particularly sees as highly unwelcome, in some cases triggering (threats of) legal action in order to get them removedfrom hosting sites, are lms focusing on extreme forms of exploration; free playpractices often looking for ways to exploit the game's design. Blizzard fears theseproductions as the play practices shown in these lms do not only violate theEULA, but also because they teach other players. This is the flipside of replay-oriented machinima; these lms demonstrate how to play better but, potentially,also how to cheat. A machinima can, for instance, show in detail a discoveredbug in the game's software which allows players to reach areas in the game worldthey are not supposed to visit. Such a video can subsequently cause a surge incopycat behaviour, but also result in new ways to exploit such a bug that the ini-tial discovery did not conceive of, which then are also recorded on video and dis-tributed to the community. The more extreme explorers, always looking for the limits of the game's design, can be considered as going beyond \"textual poaching\", media scholarHenry Jenkins' way of describing the act of picking up those elements media fansnd pleasurable or useful for their own needs and, in some cases, deploying themin new, unexpected ways outside of the formal narrative or ctional world onoffer. 19Rather, they are closer to \"culture jammers\", in Jenkins eyes \"classic avant-gardists\" celebrating their \"own freedom from media control even as theysee the 'masses' as still subjected to manipulation\". 20By spreading their practices132 machinimaamong the community through machinima they entice others to join the uncon- trolled fun. Jenkins disagrees with the originator of the term, Mark Dery, whosees jamming as a practice actively perverting existing mass media productionsas an almost political act of counter-culturalism. 21In his discussion on television fandom, Jenkins emphasizes that \"fans do not see television content as 'ugly, dulland boring' or necessarily see themselves as acting in opposition to dominantmedia institutions\". 22The same goes for World of Warcraft explorers; they usu- ally do not want to resist the game but at the same time they want to show itshidden marvels to the rest of the community. Whether the makers are poachers or jammers, some exploration movies have actually led to (threats of) legal action and formal changes in the game's designthrough patching by Blizzard, thereby frustrating potential copycat behaviour.In May 2005, an avid explorer by the name of Dopesh published Exploration:The Movie, a machinima showing content few people outside of the core designteam had ever seen. 23It showed characters walking through regions which many thought did not even exist yet. Some of these regions have been published in theyears following the movie, like the Ahn'Qiraj ruins, the Caverns of Time or theOutlands. Other regions shown still have not been announced as being in pro-duction when this study was nalized in mid-2010 and might never see the lightof day in nished form. Dopesh and his explorer friends nevertheless managedto get inside of rough and temporary design versions of these regions, in theprocess surprising friend and foe. Embarrassingly enough, Exploration: TheMovie also claims to show the secretive GM Island and Designer Island, regions never meant to ever reach the public eye. Here, the game masters and designers\"live\" and play with the game's design. Among other things, we can see anexplorer ride his mount over large, barren terrain with the sentence \"chum is mylove monkey\" written all over it, probably the work of a designer making fun ofanother Blizzard employee. Not surprisingly, Blizzard was not amused by thisdisclosure of secret content and some of the websites hosting the movie wereasked to take it down. One major problem Blizzard most likely had with Exploration: The Movie was that the lm did not just show unnished areas in the game's world, but alsohow to get there through what has become known as \"wallwalking\". Thisexploitative technique involves walking up steep hills at a very specic anglemaking it possible to \"stick\" to the surface and climb them. Through the moun-taineering-like wallwalking, players were, for example, shown how to get up thehills surrounding the human city of Stormwind, showing the see-through \"back-side\" of the city's architecture, a fa\u00e7ade of hardly discernable forms and textures. In contrast to most exploration videos, the creators of this and similar machinima productions were far more dedicated to provide a resistive commen-tary on the game. Judging from their now defunct Nogg-Aholic blog, wallwalk-133 Ren\u00e9 Glasing and exploring in general is very much seen as an act of deance in Jenkins' original meaning of culture jamming.24Clicking on the topic \"why do we wall- walk?\" on the blog leads to a six-panel cartoon, showing a man who tells afriend why he enjoys walking on a little wall on his way to work. The manframes his activity as a \"pleasing physical activity\" which elevates/estranges thewallwalker from the surrounding world (\"for a minute when I'm done the worldis strange\") as well as its inhabitants (\"I pass these rich fucks with their little bagsof dogshit - shithandlers in fancy track suits\"). It suggests that the wallwalkerssee their deviant practices as a transformative experience, which not only pro-vides an altered view on the ctional world but also sets them apart from playerswho just follow WoW' s main play strategies. It is not the continuous collecting of bigger, better and more expensive items - one of WoW' s core instrumental goals - which makes these wallwalkers happy; it is the gratication of free playin its purest form. Additionally, the blog offers a series of posts entitled \"Why WoW Is a Bad Game\", which provides a host of reasons why the owners of the blog are dissat-ised with the core game as designed by Blizzard. Their stake in the explorationmachinima productions seems clear: they want to break open established normsin, and views on, the game. The lms are both explorations of the game's limitsas critiques or expos\u00e9s of the game's merits and failures. The fact that Blizzardactually took steps to limit the distribution of Exploration: The Movie, both established and conrmed the explorers as rebellious, strengthening the explo-ration community and pushing it underground. The attention to these machinima productions contributed to the popularity of wallwalking as a form of exploration, with the initial lms and their subse-quent removal from video sites by request of Blizzard spawning a multitude ofmachinimas showing off new discoveries. Blizzard, however, eventuallyannounced that they ofcially considered wallwalking an illegal exploit of thegame's design. Many explorers reacted furiously: why take away this \"innocent\"form of free play? Blizzard, however, commented that wallwalking techniquescould be used to achieve unfair advantages over other players, for instance, inplayer-versus-player combat situations. In early 2006, Blizzard quietly removedthe possibilities for wallwalking through a software patch. The case of wallwalking and its removal from the game by patching reveals the influence divergent forms of free play - especially when they are recordedand distributed through popular machinima - can have on formal changes in thegame's design. In this case, players were appropriating the game in ways Blizzarddid not expect them to and, ultimately, decided to hinder them from doing so anyfurther. Usually, exploration is more about immersing one's self in the ctionalworld than it is about achieving structural goals, a form of play that is allowed,even encouraged by Blizzard through the environmental design of the game134 machinimaworld. The fact that wallwalking also caused players to exploit more goal-ori- ented content - for instance, in player-versus-player combat - caused unwantedoverlap between free and instrumental play. Not only did players get to placesthey should not be, they also caused unfairly balanced game situations. Culturalpoaching and jamming became so intertwined that Blizzard ultimately founditself reacting with the removal of the possibilities for wallwalking altogether. The stakes of wallwalkers are about valuing the freedom to explore, and to play and otherwise behave in such a way as to defy the norm; machinimamoviemaking is an important tool to express these values. Even if Blizzardwould appreciate the free play forms of the explorers, they cannot condone whatthey see as cheating. Patching out the option of wallwalking stops the practicealtogether, whether it is used innocently or deviously. Players valuing explo-ration beyond the limits set by Blizzard are continuing their efforts to exploreand exploit. Machinima showing their activities still appear on many video host-ing sites, including Warcraftmovies.com, as well as in peer-to-peer networks -placing them further out of the reach of Blizzard's control sphere. This case study focused on widening the possibilities for free play by extending or adjusting the ctional universe as designed by Blizzard throughmachinima. Such play practices often involve the use of third-party programmes,exploits and other deviations from the core game, and potentially leading togames of stake with other players or, more drastically, Blizzard, who might con-sider these forms of participatory culture as undesired. The fact that not all \"ille-gal\" practices are punished by Blizzard, like in the use of certain tools used toproduce popular machinima like Tales of the Past III , results from the freedom Blizzard has as a powerful stakeholder to differentiate between \"good\" and\"bad\" appropriation. This decision-making process is not negotiated betweenplayers and platform owners, nor is it entirely transparent; machinima makersare, to a certain degree, left in the dark about whether their practices of appro-priation and creative productions move within or strays beyond the contractualboundaries of the game.

How did such sound technologies affect transformations inthe cultural practices of listening to and making music in Western Europe?Which shifts did they trigger in the traditional boundaries between active andpassive participation in music culture? What was, for instance, the impact of thetape recorder on the boundaries between producing and consuming music, lis-tening and creating, copying and editing music? And what did such changesmean for the roles of the creator, technician, producer and distributor of music? These were the questions that originally fuelled our research into sound tech- nologies and cultural practices. One of our wider aims was to study the impact oftechnologization, particularly the impact of digital technologies, on art and cul-ture. The original phrasing of our questions suggested a one-way arrow fromtechnology to musical practice - technology being the agent of change in theworld of music. Our actual way of working, however, maximized the options foranalyzing the effect of existing cultural practices on the use of new technologies.In other words, while our wording was still cast in technological deterministterms, our research design and analysis helped us to leave that behind. We did soby focusing on analogies in cultural practices - \"cultural practices\" meaning theways in which people habitually give meaning to and act upon the world sur-rounding them, and \"analogies\" meaning similarities in the ways of understand-ing and acting between different cultural practices. The next section explains139why analogies between cultural practices may lead to new insights in transfor- mations in arts and culture. We use analogies to understand how musical prac-tices change when those who pursue these practices appropriate new sound tech-nologies. The analogies approach will be illustrated by describing two sets of examples. First, we examined how a 1950s manufacturer of a new sound technology, thereel-to-reel recorder, projected the recorder's future use as a \"family soundalbum\" by creating an analogy with the already established cultural practicesconcerning the family photo album. By comparing ideas about future culturalpractices with the cultural practices that actually developed in relation to thereel-to-reel recorder, we have been able to show why the projected analogy didnot fully work. The second example concerns the transformation of a long-established cultural practice of collectively ranking and listening to popular hitsongs on the radio. In the year 2000, this practice from the 1960s was reinvigo-rated when traditional radio broadcasts were combined with new Web 2.0 tech-nologies in a Dutch project called the Top 2000. Through a multimedia plat-form, the cultural practice of listening to hit lists was combined with nationalheritage building and sharing narrative memories across generations. The thirdand fourth example explore the cultural practices of mixtaping - re-recording aselection of songs onto a blank cassette tape - and a new cultural practiceengaged in by members of the ccMixter web community. The platform ccMixteris a site that encourages the mixing and sampling of music, and is discussed indetail in the case study elsewhere in this volume. The nal example concerns thecultural practice of deejaying - playing recorded music in front of a live audi-ence. As we will show, the practices of mixtaping, ccMixter and deejayinginclude functions analogous with those of archaeologists, reference persons andgenealogists. In the last sections of this chapter, we will return to the theoretical framework and reflect on the practical consequences of our approach as described in thesecases. What do the results of our methodology contribute to contemporary the-ory on technologization and musical practice? And what is their practical rele-vance for sound-media policy? How can you study cultural practices? We have already provided a short denition of cultural practices: the ways inwhich members of a culture habitually give meaning to and act upon the worldsurrounding them. The word \"habitually\" in this denition expresses the sharedand taken-for-granted nature of the way in which participants of a cultural prac-tice understand, speak about and take action within their world. It is about thevalues, norms and symbols - the web of meanings - a collective subscribes to140 sound technologies and cultural practiceswithout constantly making these explicit. This shared web of meanings is what makes the practice cultural.1However, the notion of cultural practices does not only refer to shared meanings or agreed-upon assumptions, but also to routineways of acting upon the world. These everyday ways of acting make a culturalpractice a practice. The cultural practices approach we advocate in this article uses the habitual character of much of human activity to zoom in on the interplay of technology,discourse and human action. A practice is an activity which occurs repeatedlyand exists only as long as it is repeated. It is the habitual or customary aspect ofpractices that gives human activity a chance to become connected to particulartools and technologies, and to develop a discourse around it. At the same time,the gradually developing and customary character of practices is exactly whatmakes them hard to research. The cultural anthropologist embodies a particulargeographical-cultural distance towards the practice s/he studies that enables himor her, at least partially, to make the habitual visible. The historian is assisted bythe distance in time period between the historian's present and the historical paststudied. By contrast, the analysis of current or recently established practiceswithin one's own culture requires other ways for opening up the commonground between the analyzer and the analyzed. A methodological focus on analogies in cultural practices turns out to be an effective tool in making the customary character of cultural practices explicit.Our approach is thoroughly comparative, displaying resemblances at rst sightand differences in second instance. We use two types of analogies: those made by(historical) actors themselves, and those made by us as analysts. An example ofan actor's analogy is the way in which manufacturers of reel-to-reel recorders and their marketers produced analogies between the family photo album and thefamily sound album in their advertisements of tape recording in the 1950s. In ananalyst analogy, however, the researchers are the ones who suggest an analogy in order to unravel the characteristics of particular cultural practices. This is whatwe did when we aimed to explain the success of the Top 2000. However, we also combined actors' and analysts' analogies, as illustrated by the case studies ofmixtaping, ccMixter and deejaying. And to qualify our use of analogies evenmore, it is important to stress that even the analyst analogy always starts frommetaphors and comparisons used by the actors studied, yet transforms these intoa complete analogy in order to highlight particular aspects of the cultural prac-tices that would remain implicit without invoking the full analogy (see theccMixter case study for how this works in detail). This focus on analogies in cultural practices in order to understand the role of technology in transformations of art and culture is not exactly new. Theapproach is rooted in a wide variety of intellectual traditions. Most relevant hereare anthropology, media studies, and science and technology studies (STS). One141 Karin Bijsterveld, Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, Annelies Jacobs and Bas Jansensource of inspiration has been Daniel Miller's and Don Slater's ethnographic study of how inhabitants of Trinidad and their family members abroad did\"reconstitute or enact Trini-ness online\". They showed how these people's cul-tural identity and traditions both fed into the way they used the Internet andwere reconstituted by it at the very same time. 2Another important input came from media theorists Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin. Their concept ofremediation has underlined the signicance of seeking analogies between olderand newer media, even though their focus was on the form and format of mediarather than on the cultural practices media are embedded in. 3Finally, the synthe- sis published by STS scholars Nelly Oudshoorn and Trevor Pinch on the co-pro-duction of users and technology has been crucial. Their work unravels the manyways in which users have given new meanings to artefacts as well as to them-selves in the process of appropriating and domesticating these artefacts, oftenresulting in new designs. 4It is from this last tradition of scholarly work that we learned to take both highly successful technologies and relative failures intoaccount. Analogies in cultural practices of music I: Tape recording and the Top 2000 Compared to the big commercial success of the compact cassette recorder later in the 1960s, the reel-to-reel recorder (commonly referred to as tape recorder)was a failure in terms of sales rates. It was also a marketing failure since its actualuse signicantly diverged from the use promoted by manufacturers. 5Remark- ably, the tape recorder, which was introduced for consumers in the early 1950s,was not marketed primarily as a music-playing device. On the contrary, theindustry's initial advertisements presented it as a device with a host of options, ofwhich playing recorded music was merely one. In most cases, the family soundalbum topped the list of things to do with a tape recorder. Its function was torecord precious moments of family life, such as little John's rst speech or Mar-got's recorder tune, and then sharing the tape with relatives and friends livingelsewhere. Every family, after all, had one or more albums with photos of impor-tant or happy moments. The tape recorder, in other words, was introduced as afamily memory device. The notion of the sound tape as a family album implied a comparison between sound recording and amateur photography. This analogy was madeexplicit in tape recorder guide books: playing sounds out loud was like blowingup a photo; the sound level indicator could be compared to the light meter, andthe recorder was to the sound hobbyist what the camera was to the photogra-pher. But, according to a handbook published by Philips, the advantage of thetape recorder over the photo camera was that the sound \"print\" was readily142 sound technologies and cultural practicesavailable, whereas photographs needed to be developed outside the home.6 Moreover, the handbook emphasized that sounds carried more meaning than photos. As one importer of Grundig recorders asserted, the power of sound was\"that it remains vivacious and binds people together more forcefully than anypicture. In a person's voice we encounter his personal moods; in the sound of arunning machine we can hear force and speed; the sound of birds connects uswith nature.\" 7 Other possibilities that were promoted for tape recorder use at home were creating voice letters for family overseas, rehearsing amateur music perform-ances, and making radio plays. In the course of time, the list of tape recorderfunctions grew from dozens to hundreds. Remarkably, the position of musicwithin the burgeoning list of use options shifted substantially. At rst, recordingradio programmes was mentioned as one use among many. A radio recordingoffered the opportunity to listen to one's favourite melody or favourite lectureover and over again. From the late 1950s on, though, playing recorded musicincreasingly topped the list of things to do at home with a tape recorder. It wasfor instance promoted as a means to provide several hours of nonstop back-ground music during a dance party at home. Over time, the promotion of thetape recorder's multiple options was carried to great extremes. Our research into the actual use of the tape recorder claried how in promot- ing the tape recorder as a family sound album, manufacturers took only part ofthe practical consequences of the family photo album analogy into account.Their initial image of using the tape recorder as an audio family album onlyincluded the making of sound souvenirs, not the practice of retrieving the soundsouvenirs or listening to them in a collective setting. While a photo album couldeasily be drawn from the book shelf, the tape recorder did not live up to that levelof portability. While photos can be browsed and photo albums can leafedthrough, the linearity of tapes and recording machines turned out to be a lotmore cumbersome. Using the forward and rewind buttons was an option, buta time-consuming one. And while it is easy to make notes below pictures in aphoto album, recording oral comments prior to making a recording, or makingnotes in a separate notebook takes a lot of planning. Without such archiving andlisting activities, the recordings would hardly reveal any information to laterusers, the heirs of the tapes. Although BASF attempted to educate its users intoarchivists of sound recordings, by designing special devices for storing andarchiving, most people preferred their own systems. Even to the most capable and experienced users, listening to family recordings during family gatherings did not become as common a rite as exchanging pho-tos. Some of our respondents merely told us that looking at pictures was easierthan listening to tapes. We would like to suggest two more possible explana-tions, in line with our focus on sound recording as a cultural practice. Unlike143 Karin Bijsterveld, Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, Annelies Jacobs and Bas Jansenwatching and commenting upon photos during family meetings, listening to recordings required all people present to be involved in the activity at the sametime. Everyone in the room had to be quiet, whereas people had become increas-ingly used to combining listening to music with other activities. Moreover, fami-lies treasuring their sound souvenirs often discovered years later that the hard-ware they needed for listening to their tapes no longer worked or had beenreplaced by hardware that was incompatible with their tapes. And even if theystill had a working set-up, and tapes had not lost their original quality, the tapesdid not speak for themselves. This means that while the analogy between soundrecording and taking pictures seemed to work for the production of the record-ings, it did not work for the cultural practice of retrieving and collectively listen-ing to the tapes in a family context. While the reel-to-reel recorder was an unexpected commercial disappoint- ment, our second example of a (re)invented cultural practice has been a big suc-cess. Since 1999, a public radio station in the Netherlands has organized a yearly,widely acclaimed, ve-day broadcast of the two thousand most popularrecorded songs of all times - a list compiled entirely by public radio listeners whosend in their ve favourite pop songs. The project originally aimed at revampingthe established cultural practice of collectively ranking and listening to well-known songs, but by deploying the amenities of the Internet a new dimensionwas added. During the event, the station solicits online personal comments, bothaesthetic evaluations and memories attached to songs. Besides having disc jock-eys read these comments aloud during a live broadcast, they are also posted intheir entirety on an interactive website. In addition, the station opens up a chatbox for exchanging comments. A television broadcast is the grand nale. 8 Whereas the study of the reel-to-reel recorder started out from the analogies dened by historical actors (manufacturers and marketing people), our under-standing of the Top 2000's success was informed by analogies introduced by usas researchers. Even though it is likely that the established cultural practice of lis-tening to play lists helped to rst establish the Top 2000's popularity, listening to play lists as such can not be the sole key to understanding its massive applaud.The rst analogy we used to describe the dimension added to this practice wasthat of building a national heritage, a collective repertoire of favourite popsongs. Unlike most of its commercial counterparts, the Top 2000 is shaped as a public event, as songs are voted for by all participants through elections ratherthan through ranking by commercial hit lists. The entire democratic process ofvoting and ranking adds to the experience of the Top 2000 as a collectively cho- sen national repertoire, even though only a minority of the selected songs haveDutch lyrics or are produced by Dutch bands. Yet the Top 2000's success as a national event - more than half the population of the Netherlands plugs into the event every year - cannot merely be explained144 sound technologies and cultural practicesby the nation's craving for a collective repertoire. In addition, we stressed the sig- nicance of the Top 2000 as a platform for exchanging personal stories of musi- cal reminiscence. Besides playing the records on the radio, stories about songswere solicited through a website, and a selection of those stories was read duringthe broadcast. These narratives created a collectively experienced nostalgicmood, in contrast to a conception of nostalgia as a consumable stylistic modeespoused by commercial outlets such as Top 40 or oldies stations. 9The exchange of comments often happened across generations, enhancing the collectiveness ofthe experience. In 2006, after realizing that listeners were interested specicallyin storytelling, the Dutch Top 2000's organizers decided to launch a separate sto- rytelling platform as part of the annual event. Listeners had become used tosending in their spontaneous comments. But to allow space for more literarycontributions, the radio station called for short stories relating a specic musicalmemory or experience. In the months leading up to the last week of December,listeners were invited to send in personal short stories based on a specic songfeatured in the ranking. The response from listeners was overwhelming: over athousand listeners sent in their stories. A jury selected the ten best stories, andduring a special celebratory radio event in January, the winning stories were readout loud by professional speakers, embellished by suitable background sounds,which was followed - of course - by the song. All stories are preserved by theDutch National Archive, which has created a special website to make the collec-tive heritage of these musical stories permanently accessible to everyone inter-ested. As elucidated by this example, the Top 2000 project taps into three different cultural practices, two of which we articulated by means of analogies: listeningto play lists, creating a collective national repertoire andexchanging stories across generations. Collective ranking and storytelling have now become anintegral part of the musical event. The process of narrating, discussing and nego-tiating personal musical reminiscences and building collective musical heritage isfar more important than the ultimate ranking of songs. Moreover, as becameclear from public responses, the Top 2000 thrives on the inseparable exchange of songs and stories. Through a combination of the annual radio event, website andtelevision broadcast, this multimedia platform offers space for consensus build-ing and the creation of a national heritage of pop songs, while simultaneouslyserving as a podium for collective nostalgia and communal reminiscences. We have shown how we employed an actor's analogy in the history of the reel- to-reel recorder and analyst analogies in the Top 2000 example, although even the analyst analogies were rooted in actors' wording of what happened in thecultural practice under study. We would like to add that the analogy in the taperecorder example is a forward looking analogy - an analogy to project a particu-lar future - while the analogies used to unravel the Top 2000 event are back-145 Karin Bijsterveld, Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, Annelies Jacobs and Bas Jansenward-looking analogies. In both cases, however, we presented analogies to explain the success and failure of cultural practices projected and triggered bynew sound technologies. Yet using analogies to explain the success and failure ofnew sound technology-related cultural practices is not the only way to makeanalogies productive. Analogies in cultural practices of music II: Mixtaping, ccMixter and deejaying Our project did not only cover the cultural practices involving the reel-to-reel recorder and enhanced radio, but also included cultural practices related to thecompact cassette recorder, Internet communities and the turntable. In three spe-cic case studies, we examined the cultural practice of mixtaping in the 1970s,when the novel device of the cassette recorder was deployed by users to compileso-called \"mixtapes\" of recorded popular songs; we also studied activities ofmembers of ccMixter, an online community platform for remixing recordedmusic (see insert for detailed description); and nally, we investigated the con-temporary cultural practice of deejaying by interviewing a number of contempo-rary Dutch DJs who use either old turntable technologies or new digital tech-nologies to create a live dancing event, asking them about their self-describedroles. 10All three case studies centre on cultural practices of mixing and re- recording popular music and make use of both actor's analogies and analyst'sanalogies. So far, most current debates about the production of recorded music practices have revolved around the issue of music copyright where recorded music is basi-cally regarded as a product. In line with our approach, we intend to shift thisfocus to the cultural practice of mixing recorded music by focusing on a phe-nomenon called credit giving. The term refers to the reward or acknowledge-ment which partakers in a cultural practice receive for their contributions. Thedominant idea is that an artist is admired for the creative part of music produc-tion; the recording industry takes care of the practical side of the productionprocess; and consumers admire the artist, pay all partakers in the productionprocess, and in return are enabled to listen to their music of choice. Bas Jansenhas coined this line of thinking \"the commercial theory of appropriate credit\".Now that digital technologies make it easier for anyone to create, manipulateand distribute music, this division of labour is under pressure, resulting in thecopyright debates. We will explain how we can take a different approach to thesedebates by focusing on analogies to cultural practices. In the specic cases ofmixtaping, ccMixter and deejaying, we would like to show how the use of bothactor and analyst's analogies helps to challenge taken-for-granted ways of credit-giving. 146 sound technologies and cultural practicesWe could only properly understand styles of credit giving and roles connected to these by unravelling their analogies with roles outside the music world. In all three cases, the main actor is not just someone who samples and mixes samplesof recorded music, but also functions as a reference person: just like library refer-ence persons, \"mixers\" and re-recorders direct their audience to existing yetundiscovered sources. The role of reference persons becomes more interestingwhen they interact with individuals or groups by trying to determine a query - aneed for music their audience may or may not be aware of. For instance, a mix - taper acting as reference person can introduce the recipient of his or her mixtapeto new musical territory, designing the tape specically to please or to challengethe recipient's musical preference. The DJs implant this activity of \"query read-ing\" into the context of a continuous relationship with the crowd, enabling themto gradually steer the mood on the dance floor and to generate joyous sharedexperiences. And the users of the online remix community ccMixter may recom-mend tracks to each other, thus mediating between a corpus of compositions andan audience of mostly anonymous visitors navigating the ccMixter website. In apopular music culture which for many people is too rich with possible musicalexperiences to nd one's way in, reference persons provide a vital service of inter-pretation and selection. Whereas canon-like guides such as hit charts take a one-size-ts-all approach, a good reference person takes someone's personal prefer-ences and needs into account. Thus, at their best, reference persons help othersto deepen their engagement with the culture around them. Another analogy that may expand our understanding of mixing and re- recording as a cultural practice, relates to another professional position outsidethe musical world: that of the archaeologist. For instance, DJs interested in play-ing vinyl recordings often refer to their search for such recordings as \"digging\" -hence it is the actors themselves who trigger the analogy to archaeology. As popmusic archaeologists they play a role in the preservation of its historical treas-ures. Just like real archaeologists, they are not only interested in the digging andconservation of vinyl records, but also in presenting their treasures to a new gen-eration. So-called conservationist DJs are eager to disclose these remnants of themusical past to an audience which may then develop a sensibility for the fact thatpresent-day music is not necessarily the measure of all things. A nal instructive analyst-induced analogy to interpret the cultural practice of mixing and re-recording music is to describe the role of the mixer as a genealo-gist. In general terms, the role of the genealogists consists of giving due credit topredecessors and to tradition. In the ccMixter case, the role of the mixer asgenealogist is most explicit; the role is not performed by one person, as in thecase of the reference person or archaeologist, but is shared by all ccMixter mem-bers. One of the most innovative aspects of ccMixter community is that all mem-bers make explicit the relation between remixers and the ones whose work they147 Karin Bijsterveld, Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, Annelies Jacobs and Bas Jansenreuse and thus give generous and due credit. In the rest of popular music culture, relations to predecessors are often obscured. DJs, for instance, play pre-existingmusic, and this generates copyright issues, but these are taken care of behind thescenes by venue holders. The commercial theory of appropriate credit insists onreproducing the myth of original creation, and, by the same token, on obscuringrelations of genealogy. A look at ccMixter shows us how a renewed awareness ofgenealogical issues can revitalize a community's sense that making music is adeeply social activity. An emphasis on cultural practices of re-recording music by articulating analo- gies helps shift the emphasis from recorded music as a creative product or com-mercial commodity to mixing and re-recording as a process and a newly devel-oping, habitual user practice. In these new practices, agency is far from static;these shifting roles of cultural agents, elucidated by the analogies to referencepersons, archaeologists and genealogists also change established notions ofcredit-giving and force us to imagine alternative ones. Theoretical harvest of the analogies-of-cultural-practices approach How have the case studies described above shaped the frameworks used to theo-rize transformations in arts and culture? Why does a focus on cultural practices- as opposed to a focus on products, producers or industrial processes - proposea substantially different insight into historical and contemporary changes in therecording of popular music? And what is the advantage of using both actor's andanalyst's analogies in exploring how various agents help change and shape cul-tural practices? In a period when there is a heightened focus on accelerated tech-nological changes, on technologization, it is important to analyze both historicaland current changes in musical practices by means of analogies, in order to helpredirect the discourse of contemporary debates, which parameters are still pre-dominantly grounded in traditional models of producers versus consumers,commoditization of cultural content and romantic notions of creativity. What we learn from the cases of the reel-to-reel recorder and the Top 2000 project is that there is no self-evident or predictable relationship between alreadyestablished cultural practices and the way they evolve after the introduction ofnew technologies. In the rst case, marketers and manufacturers promoted theanalogy between sound recording and family photography, whereas in realitythe two cultural practices happened to be too different to be aligned. In the caseof the Top 2000, the introduction of an interactive digital platform did not merely reinvigorate the purported cultural practice of ranking and listening topopular music on the radio, but active participants who contributed to the rank-ings and stories in fact added two unforeseen dimensions to this cultural prac-tice: collectively creating a national heritage of songs and sharing stories across148 sound technologies and cultural practicesgenerations. Most debates on the transformation of musical practices hold on to the traditional notion of recorded music being a product whose form and shapeis primarily determined by producers, whether marketing specialists or radio sta-tion managers. But the examples above prove the signicance of recognizing therole of users in steering the directions - success or failure - of technological inno-vation. While this will be no news to scholars in science and technology studies,our eye for analogies in cultural practices does help to provide additional expla-nations for the appropriation of new technologies. A similar urgency for the recognition of cultural practices as determining forces can be traced in recent copyright debates. As explained in the second set ofcase studies, the music industry's argument to protect copyright and restrict mostpractices involving the mixing and re-recording of popular music is rooted in aremarkably old-fashioned model of creators and consumers mediated by anindustry which turns immaterial creativity into a material consumable commod-ity, resulting in a worthwhile musical experience for listeners. Every actor in thismodel has a prescribed role and function, thus legitimizing the prevailing ideason credit giving. Ideally, the artist creates songs not for money but from anintrinsic creative drive. Paradoxically, the artist deserves nancial support pre-cisely for this reason, so she can pursue her noble goals full-time. The artist's\"real\" reward is as immaterial as the value she creates, namely the love andadmiration of her audience. The industry deserves a nancial reward insofar as itprovides a useful service. Consumers give credit in two ways: they nanciallyreward both artist and industry and they reward the artist with attention andadmiration. With the advent of digital music technologies, the way of understanding pop music production described by the dominant model has lost some of its self-evi-dence, and competing ideas have been launched. Critics of the old model dulynote the changed role of the music listener, who is now a more active participant;this idea ts the participatory nature of new music platforms, many of whichpromote the active sharing and mixing of recorded music. Many critics, how-ever, do not challenge established romantic notions of musicians as geniuses andthe industry as inhibiting the creativity of all participants; rather, they foster thenew ideal of generalized artistry. Only those theorists who use the concept ofsharing economies, most notable Lawrence Lessig, the founder of Creative Com-mons, actually investigate the conditions underlying individuals' motivation toact creatively. 11They attempt to articulate the social principles that make a durable sharing economy possible. The studies of deejaying and the ccMixter case bring an alternative viewpoint to these copyright debates by emphasizing not products or industrial processes,but cultural practices and their specic styles of credit-giving as an importantfactor in the transformation and processing of recorded music. As these studies149 Karin Bijsterveld, Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, Annelies Jacobs and Bas Jansenillustrate, new digital technologies do not self-evidently result in new cultural practices but are part of a gradual reinvention of musical practices and thereshaping of cultural habits of people engaged with recorded music. It is anintense and complex process, where actors take on new roles and assign them-selves new functions - or more accurately: old roles and old functions in newforms - which should be rightly acknowledged. The analogies approach revealedhow practitioners of this cultural practice, such as DJs, are keenly aware of theirdifferent roles: we compared their roles to archaeologists and reference personsto accent the novel kinds of credit at stake in these practices. In a similar vein,members of the ccMixter community invent new roles for themselves, mostnotably the role of genealogist, a role that is closely intertwined with a new typeof credit-giving. In the context of their revamped cultural practice of mixing andre-recording recorded music online, they properly acknowledge all previous pro-ducers of sampled fragments. The approach to emphasize and specify cultural practices and the focus on analogies to highlight and accentuate the changing roles of practices and practi-tioners decisively detracts from traditional models theorizing transformationsin recorded pop music culture. The old model, insisting on the tripartite divisionin artists, industry and consumers, and on the exaltation of the artist, solely rec-ognizes the commercial production of pop music and the passive consumptionof recordings as valid cultural practices. However, as we have illustrated in thecase studies, there is a greater diversity of contributing to pop music culturethan this model recognizes. The strict division between standard roles and theundue emphasis on the role of the creator detracts from the recognition of otherimportant types of participation. By comparing both old and new types of par-ticipation and by displaying analogies to older cultural practices both inside andoutside the music world, we show how the digitalization of music has beenappropriated in ways that reiterate cultural habits deeply rooted in Western cul-ture. Practical harvest of the analogies-of-cultural-practices approach Scholars studying media are used to receiving phone calls and emails from jour-nalists wanting to write an article or prepare an item for a radio or televisionshow on the history of, or contemporary changes in, the media they themselveswork for. We were no exception and during our project we contributed to arti-cles in newspapers as varied as de Volkskrant and De Telegraaf, and items for radio shows broadcast by AVRO, Wereldomroep and Teleac. One day, however,a less common type of phone call came in. It happened to be the director of acompany seeking advice. The company - which has requested anonymity - hadbeen producing several products involving sound for quite some time. Some of150 sound technologies and cultural practicesthese products were a huge success, others had unexpectedly failed. After read- ing a newspaper article in which one of us had been interviewed about the his-tory of the tape recorder, the company's director realized that it could be worth-while to review the history of the company's own products in order tounderstand their varying levels of success. Indeed, we spoke to the director on hisassumptions about the cultural practices in which he had thought his productswould function, notably the failed ones. Could we help him make these assump-tions explicit by comparing his ideals with similar sound technologies andrelated cultural practices in the past? One of his assumptions was that consumersliked to go for original sound-related gifts, neglecting, as we stressed, the highlyconventional and ritualized situations in which he wanted to embed his prod-ucts. As researchers, we realized our analogies approach was not merely usefulas a theoretical prism, but could also be deployed to consult on product develop-ment - even though the term is rather pretentious given the informality of theactual occasion. In addition to such free consultancy on innovation, we think our studies are also practically relevant for current debates on the policies regulating particularsound media. Besides the above-mentioned copyrights debate, here is anotherexample. Recently, media researcher Philomeen Lelieveldt reflected on the statusof Dutch public radio stations in an international perspective, and notably on theproblematic position of classical and contemporary art music programmes. 12 Policymakers in the Netherlands apparently struggle to nd an effective policy toprovide for such programmes. Research shows that people increasingly spendless time listening to radio; more importantly, the relative amount of time spenton primary listening (focused listening), has shifted to secondary listening (lis-tening while doing something else in parallel such as driving), and non-listening(radio as mere background sound). Whereas commercial radio gains ground,public broadcasting stations press budget cuts upon their classical music pro-grammes. Since commercial radio has been successful in keeping the audiencehooked by exploiting non-listening through the use of highly predictable formatsand volume compression, Dutch policymakers dene the role of commercialradio as providing for entertainment and background music, while public radioshould focus on giving news and information. Classical music and contemporaryart music are thus squeezed out, or forced to focus on providing news aboutmusic. Lelieveldt interestingly suggests that one way out of this cul-de-sac for art music is to learn more about the actual functions of radio. People may listen toradio for intellectual pleasure, education and repertoire, or to gain knowledgeabout norms and values; for companionship or entertainment, during non-demanding work for instance; and for background music that enhances theirtempo of routine activities or blocks out distracting noise. The rst set of func-151 Karin Bijsterveld, Jos\u00e9 van Dijck, Annelies Jacobs and Bas Jansentions requires primary or secondary listening, the second series necessitates sec- ondary listening, while for the last set secondary or non-listening sufces. Shealso notes, however, that people can listen to radio as a side-activity and listenattentively at the very same time. Moreover, classical music radio has acted asproducer of performances and thus has functions beyond radio itself. We agree with Lelieveldt that it is important to deepen our knowledge of the functions of radio and the complexity of listening. Yet her remarks also lead usto believe that the distinction between primary, secondary and non-listening -which comes from communication research - may not be so helpful after all.Whereas the communication studies' focus is on various levels of attention, acultural practices approach would considerably widen the scope of research,notably when the analogies between musical and other practices are taken intoaccount. This would, for instance, highlight nostalgic listening in the culturalpractice that evolved along with the Top 2000, or mark as explorative listeningthe musical practices engaged in, and invited to engage in, by archaeologists andreference persons. It would also be helpful to think about the multisensoryaspects of listening, such as when car drivers use audio technologies to create asoundtrack to what they see. A cultural practice approach might even suggest analternative policy concerning classical music on public radio. It would be worth-while to know, for instance, which type of classical music contributes most tonostalgic or multisensory listening when commuting. Conclusions: An analog(ous) discussion of digital sound technologies If we listen in on debates about the effects of digital sound technologies, such asdebates on piracy due to sampling software or copyright infringement due tomp3 technologies, these debates are remarkably digital in kind. Most discussantseither defend the commercial theory of appropriate credit which serves the inter-ests of traditional producers, or defend the romantic notion of generalizedartistry for people traditionally known as consumers. Positions in these debatesare often binary; it is either \"zero\" or \"one\", and nothing in between, as if thedigital character of the technologies has coloured the nature of the discussion. Itwill come as no surprise that we defend an analogue approach, focusing bothmetaphorically and literally on analogies. This alternative approach, however,does not just stress the continuities between 0 and 1, the shades of grey betweenblack and white, but also presents a decisive shift in the theoretical and practicalframeworks for understanding the cultural production of recorded music. Our method of focusing on analogies between cultural practices, either as an actor's or analyst's category, helps compare cultural practices of recorded musicprior and after the introduction of digital technologies. These analogies also helpto break free from established categories theorizing the production and con-152 sound technologies and cultural practicessumption of music, and assist in creating new parameters to discuss the revamped roles of actors, such as the archaeologist, the referent or the genealo-gist. Acknowledging these new roles and the new types of credit-giving thatcome along with them, is an important step in designing a new model for under-standing cultural practices of music in the age of digital technology, a model thatmay counteract traditional models rooted in product and industry-orientednotions of copyrights and nancial rewards. At the very same time, our analysis shows how novel types of credit-giving build on older ones. This holds both for cultural practices connected to digital sound technologies and for those linked to analogue sound technologies - for ccMixter andfor mixtaping, for example. The implication is that although we have something new to contribute to the discussion about the world of music inthe digital age, there is no reason to believe that we need different sets of concep-tual tools for analyzing the processes of technologization and of digitalization inmusic. Studying both processes in the same manner has actually helped to get away from discussing today's world of music merely in terms of a dystopian endof the music industry and the digital utopianism of generalized artistry. Moreover, our focus on analogies in cultural practices expands the discussion on functions and modes of listening that dominate current policy discourse onthe future of \"old\" media like public radio. If we try to account for the characterof cultural practices and add notions such as nostalgic, exploratory and multi-sensory listening to that of primary, secondary and non-listening, we may evensee a different future for public radio than the doomed one often suggested. Let'slisten for what happens. Notes 1. Our notion of \"web of meanings\" is based on the phrase \"web of significance\" introduced by Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures (London: Fontana, 1973), 3, as quoted in Re- searching Society and Culture, ed. Clive Seale (London: Sage, 2004), 13. We preferred \"web of meanings\" over \"web of significance\" because of the somewhat ambiguous meaning ofsignificance, which refers both to meaning and importance. 2.

Music technologies played a substantial role inthis phenomenon. Nowadays, any enthusiast can home-record. Sampling andmanipulating pre-existing music have become much simpler. Likewise, the distri-bution of music is no longer difcult and expensive. It is easy and costs next tonothing. As a consequence of these developments, the question how pop musicproduction works no longer has a self-evident answer. There is a widespreaddebate on the future of pop music culture, which focuses primarily on issues ofcopyright and intellectual property. Against this backdrop, my research on theonline remix community ccMixter.org, seeks to offer a different approach byinvestigating remixing as a cultural practice and drawing upon the notion ofanalogies as a conceptual tool. First, however, I will describe in more detail thedominant views on the culture of recorded popular music. Corporate views versus digital utopians In schematic terms, the copyright debate is divided into two camps, the corpo-rate music industry and the \"digital utopians\", to use the term coined by GeoffTaylor, the chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry. 1The arguments advanced by the music corporations offer variations on a single theme. Let mecite a document from the 2005 Supreme Court case MGM Studios vs Grokster(a person-to-person software provider) as it perfectly summarizes the industry'sargument in just a few lines:155If the work of creators is not protected, and is used around the world without just payment, it is very likely that, in the end, neither the creator nor the copy-right holder will be able to continue to make this work available. The loserswill not only be the artists whose talent and hard work is the creative heart oneach screen, TV and Ipod; but also the very audience that enjoys qualitymovies, music and television. 2 Thus, the music industry casts itself in the role of the provider of an indispensa- ble service. If this service is discontinued, artists, consumers and even music itselfwill suffer. This is a remarkably old argument. It was already common in theearly 1900s, well before the high days of the phonographic industry. Publishersof sheet music used it in defence against the music pirates of their age, who usedphotolithography to make cheap reproductions of the scores of popular songs. 3 In sharp contrast, the side of the digital technology enthusiasts is a very mixed bag, ranging from social activists who exalt new opportunities for grassrootscollaboration 4to market theorists who explain how companies can take advan- tage of the possibilities that Web 2.0 offers.5Among other things, there is a growing enthusiasm for remix culture and engagement through reuse.6The ero- sion of the boundaries between consumption and production also excites a lot ofinterest. 7Two positions within this heterogeneous movement are particularly important for my argument. The rst is the idea that these new technologies allow everyone to be an artist and that people will embrace this new possibility often enough to blow up thetraditional producer/consumer division. This idea might be called \"generalizedartistry\". Charles Leadbeater, for example, writes about guitarists who post clipsof their performances on YouTube, which brings them into reach of a potentiallyvery large audience: These guitarists are classic Pro Ams [professional amateurs]: they play for the love of it, not for money or fame, but they play to extremely high standards,enthusiastically learning from one another. It is now easier than ever for ProAms in many fields to create, publish and share content - whether in the formof film, software, or text ... That capacity for collective self-expression and self-organization creates new options for us to become organized, to get thingsdone together in new ways. 8 The second position within digital utopianism that matters for my argument is advanced by those who advocate sharing economies, including among othersYochai Benkler (The Wealth of Networks), Charles Leadbeater (We-Think) andLawrence 9Whereas the proponents of the notion of general- ized artistry concentrate exclusively on the forces that frustrate participatory156 the case of ccmixterculture, proponents of sharing economies are also interested in what motivates participation. Implicated in the concept of sharing economies is the idea of reci-procity - more precisely: a reciprocity that is not mediated by money. Sharingeconomies are practices of exchange that tend to be damaged or destroyed bythe introduction of money. Perceptions of fairness are crucial in this kind ofexchange. Motivating factors to take part in such an economy vary greatly: intel-lectual stimulation, activism, self-education (improving one's own skills) orshowing-off expertise to peers. 10 In my study of ccMixter, I addressed a specic question concerning popular music culture: who receives what kind of reward or acknowledgement for doingwhat in recorded music culture? Put differently, what roles or functions are per-formed in recorded music culture and how is credit given to the actors who per-form them? Each of the aforementioned positions within the copyright debatesimplicitly brings to the table a view on this matter. I want to call these respectiveviews theories of appropriate credit. From the perspective of the industry, pop music culture produces three types of actors: artists who create songs, a mediating industry that takes care of all themundane technicalities, and passive consumers who enjoy the recorded music.The artist, in this view, deserves to be admired for her art and to be nanciallyfacilitated so that she can pursue it full-time. The industry deserves a nancialreward for the service it provides. The consumers, nally, provide both themoney and the admiration necessary for a fair reward for the other players andare in return enabled to enjoy their music of choice. The theory of appropriate credit implicit in generalized artistry is a much sim- pler one, namely that no credit-giving is necessary, because people's culturalactivity and creativity stems from an internal drive or from an intrinsic motiva-tion, a will to self-expression, so to say. Unlike the proponents of generalizedartistry, advocates of sharing economies realize that an aspect of give-and-take isinvolved in social practices, and they stress the importance of norms of interac-tion in sharing economies. However, what these norms of interaction are exactlyand how these sharing economies work in general has yet to be established. I have investigated the online remix community ccMixter.org in relation to this credit question. The results of my research show that ccMixter is character-ized by a very particular style of credit-giving, that is, a way of distributing rewardand acknowledgement that is specic to the practice of remixing at ccMixter. Practices of remixing and credit-giving at ccMixter In relation to the practice of remixing at ccMixter, the term \"remix\" must betaken broadly. In its narrower sense, the word \"remix\" refers to an alternate ver-sion of an existing song. In its broader sense, it denotes any music which incor-157 Bas Jansenporates fragments of pre-existing recorded sound. Thus, the term can be used as a synonym for sampling music. The ccMixter community enables musical sam-pling of any kind. The ccMixter remix community differs from other remix communities, such as ACIDplanet.com, in that all sonic content uploaded by users is licenced underthe Creative Commons alternative copyright system. The Creative Commonsmovement is an activist movement that opposes the growing influence of restric-tive copyright regimes on culture. Traditional copyright presumptively disallowsthe making of derivative works by others than the copyright holder. With evermore cultural expressions being copyright protected, pervasive copyright poses athreat to non-professional creativity. Unless a remixer severely limits his or hercreative options, remixing is an illegal endeavour. 11The idea behind Creative Commons licences is that a content creator may reserve some rights rather thanall rights over her creation. 12Creative Commons licences make it easy to do this in a legally binding manner. Thus, at ccMixter, all uploaded content is licenced ina way which stipulates that its reuse in derivative works is allowed. As a result, adistinctive remixing practice has developed at ccMixter. The distinctive character of the ccMixter remix practice is exemplied by the way community members put so-called \"a capellas\" to use. Generally, the wordremixing refers to the practice of making an alternate version of a particularsong. This idea animates most remix contests that regularly occur on the Internet.In such contests, a sample pack, containing all the individual tracks of a particularsong or set of songs, is made available to remix enthusiasts, thus providing thebuilding blocks they can legally use. Although ccMixter started out providingsample packs of particular songs and sometimes organizing remix contestsaround such sample packs, it quickly became apparent that this way of workingmade little sense when all available sounds were Creative Commons licenced. TheccMixter community therefore gradually developed its own practice of remixing,in which the site's sample collection was used as a single sample pool. Vocal linestook on a special importance. The ccMixter community developed a practiceof using more or less complete vocal lines or \"a capellas\" (often shortened to \"pel-las\" by regular users) as the basis for an otherwise entirely new song. In the cases where a capellas are indeed not taken from pre-existing songs, a strange situation occurs: different remixes, which are built around the same acapella by different members of the community, are variations inspired by a sin-gle source, but they do not refer back to a single complete original song. The sta-tus of the original is therefore problematic. Some users of the website realize this.Loveshadow writes: \"But this site is NOT only a remix site, it is a platform tocreate new works as in Calendar Girl's case. There were no originals until CCpeople and visitors on her site made them.\" 13Administrator Fourstones (Victor Stone) responds:158 the case of ccmixterIn fact, this is my not so secret agenda all along laid bare by Loveshadow. By featuring a capellas on this site and thereby giving them special status over andabove just \"samples\" we were hoping to attract producers who would other-wise not think of cc licensing in terms of traditional \"remixing,\" but really, asLS says \"a platform to create new works.\" It seems all too narrow if all we were setting out to prove is that CC licenses enable great dance remixes. The point of the site was to prove that sharing any previously recorded content for any musical context or genre will lead to better music, period. 14 Two points deserve to be made in relation to this reply. First, ccMixter members are not traditional remixers, but neither are they traditional artists. Typically, thetraditional remixer is understood along the paradigm of the pop music artist,that is, as deserving an artistic status similar to, but lesser than the one we awardto, for instance, Beatles-style musician-composers. In a case study like this, oneneeds to be wary of this almost automatic analogy between remixers and popmusic artists. Second, not only the notion of original works is problematic atccMixter, but also the idea of original creation, that is, the idea of making some-thing new. However problematic, this notion remains highly important toccMixter members. Taking this issue of original creation and its problematic status into account, I started my analysis with a phenomenon that can be dened as the \"ccMixter'sattribution paradox\". At ccMixter, the myth of original creation is radicallyundermined. One would expect that the idea of authorship would suffer accord-ingly, and that the importance attached to attribution would decrease. Whathappens, however, is rather the opposite. The attribution of pre-existing con-tents to the \"original\" uploaders by ccMixter community members is remark-ably careful. On the ccMixter website, each uploaded composition has two pages devoted to it, namely a song page, which gives a host of details on the remix in question,and a reviews page, which contains written responses to this remix by othercommunity members. An attribution consists of a hyperlink to the song page ofthe musical piece from which material was taken. It appears on the song page ofthe new composition under the caption \"uses samples from\". The song page ofthe reused composition, for its part, has a caption \"samples used in\" with ahyperlink to the new upload(s). Thus, in the more interesting cases, a network,or rather a rhizome of relations of derivation comes into being. Members of theccMixter community tend to speak of this network of relations between compo-sitions using metaphors of familial descent. Here is one particularly rich exampleof this kind of discourse. Community member Spinmeister posted it as anexplanatory note (commentary) on the song page of one of his compositions:159 Bas JansenThis song has rather interesting DNA, although it uses only two tracks by other artists. Nonetheless, the whole history deserves mentioning, because that his-tory served as the inspiration for this remix. The DNA of this remix is: On the father's side: The midi file of the very handsome piano track by TheJoe, which in turn started its life as a piano accompaniment to an a capellatrack by Mandyleigh Storm. On the mother's side, it features the drop-dead gorgeous vocal track of Kaer Trouz, which in turn was inspired by a stunning guitar track by Loveshadow,which in turn was inspired by the lovely \"Honeychild\" a capella by Narva 9. 15 Spinmeister himself, it seems, takes on two different roles here. According to the commentary, his role as a remixer seems akin to that of an IVF doctor. At thesame time, by describing his remix, his work resembles that of a genealogist whois tracing someone's familial descent. The rhizome-like network of relations of reuse and descent at ccMixter grows continually as a result of the attribution of reused musical materials. This drawsour attention to the paradoxical aspect of ccMixter's recycling aesthetic. On theone hand, the rhizome undercuts the myth of original creativity. Consequently,we might expect that the importance of attribution is dwindling. On the otherhand, all the reused materials in question are attributed to their \"original\"uploaders. If ccMixter members had not done this with great care, this networkof links would not have existed at all. The paradox can be resolved by interpreting this preoccupation with attribu- tion as an aspect of ccMixter's style of credit-giving. The members of ccMixterhave more than one role. They are not only remixers, I would argue, but alsogenealogists. This term is an analyst-analogy, that is, an analogy that I as an ana-lyst propose. In other words, the actors involved don't necessarily see themselvesas genealogists. Yet, it is an analogy inspired by the discourse of the actors inquestion - in this particular case by the metaphors of familial decent that some-times appear when ccMixter members describe the relation between songs.Thus, the term \"genealogist\" is designed to make something explicit that isimplicitly present in ccMixter's discourse. It highlights the careful way in whichccMixter members engage with their direct musical predecessors and emphasizeshow the actions of ccMixter community members are embedded into a contextthat provides pre-existing roles. The combination of the role of the genealogistand the activity of attributing reused musical materials undercuts the risk of\"free riding\", that is, proting from the efforts of others in a way that robs theseothers from the benets of their efforts. 16Without careful attribution, the enthu- siasm of ccMixter users might diminish whenever they suspected someone else is\"free-riding\" on their contributions. Therefore, attribution plays a vital role inkeeping the ccMixter community alive.160 the case of ccmixterFig. 1. Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825), Le des Horaces (The Oath of the Horatii ), 1784.

Photo: Jeroen Werner.With a discussion of the double roles of remixer and genealogist a description of ccMixter's style of credit-giving is not yet complete. A third role is that of the reviewer. Whenever a ccMixter member uploads a new remix, other membersare able to write a short review. The term \"reviewer\" places this type of responsein a particular light, de-emphasizing its aspect of friendly chatter and stressing itsserious element of criticism. It is an actor-analogy which links the activity ofreviewing at ccMixter to the pre-existing cultural role of the art critic. The reviews written by ccMixter users in response to each other's songs reveal a striking pattern: almost all of them bestow some kind of praise. A substantialpart are simple eulogies, packaged in short comments \"greatpiece\", \"really mix\", \"this is awesome\" etc. Most reviews, however, stayclear of the comments approach, probably because it rapidly becomes tedious.Within the second category of reviews, two styles of praise are visible, which aresometimes combined. The rst is to show one's approval in a humorous andinventive manner. Generally, the humour in question is very polite in character.In the example below, for instance, reviewer Narva9 exalts the scariness of a mixwhich has a dark and brooding atmosphere: I think this one should come with a warning. It didn't really scare me or any- thing, but others may not be brave as I am so they could easily be scarred forlife. For instance, it may make some people (not me) need to check under thebed for monsters, sleep with the lights on or check the closet for evil elves. 17 The second strategy to make more of a review than a simple compliment is for the reviewer to be specic about what he or she likes. Whereas a humorousreview exposes the writer as a person of pleasant character, more detailed com-pliments typically display the author as someone with a solid knowledge ofmusic as the following examples make clear: Nice work on it. Love the bass drum, perfect contrast between the beat and the smooth a capella.18 I'm liking the verse/chorus divisions; definitely better fitted to the pella, andthat pluck track is a nice touch. 19 Criticism and advice appear seldom and are usually phrased politely or even hesitantly. When remixers respond to reviews, they consistently write with a great deal of modesty. Consider the following two examples in which a remixer has beenpositively reviewed:161 Bas JansenWOW! After this, I will get shy in posting new remixes there in the future, but, as for tonight, I may go to bed!20 Hats off? Thanks!!, I didn't expect positive comments to this, it was just aquick example with sampled chords and so on... 21 Besides praise and modesty, gratitude is a recurring theme in the exchanges between remixers and reviewers. Remixers not only appreciate positive reviews,they also express their gratitude when their work is reused by a fellow remixer: Just noticed that you had included one of my tracks in this mix so thanks for putting me into this interesting piece of work.22 The reverse situation, where a remixer is allowed to reuse someone's material, is yet another reason to say thanks: Love the clarinet!! I have used it for my weekly KlankBeeld ... Probably will upload it to mixter later today. Thanks for sharing!!23 Thank you, your sharing and your permission to use your works.24 Even the simple fact that someone has uploaded a beautiful composition may evoke similar comments: Lovely, ethereal and fragile. I'm a great fan of Sylvia's songs ... so thank you for giving it such a beautiful frame.25 In sum, the review sections are pervaded by a culture of praise, gratitude, and modesty. The ccMixter community norms are polite to the extreme. If we under-stand uploading and reciprocal reviewing as a crucial part of ccMixter's style ofcredit-giving, the reasons for this are obvious. The reciprocation of pleasantreviews is instrumental in keeping community members motivated. It conrmsthe value of the uploaded remix, and, by the same token, of contributing remixesin general. It makes clear that the listener is not a free rider who enjoys the songwithout acknowledging the remixer's efforts and it adds a pleasant social aspectto the fun of remixing itself. Conclusion In his groundbreaking analysis \"Essai sur le don\", Marcel Mauss describes gift-giving as a rule-bound activity. 26He argues that the exchange of presents entails162 the case of ccmixteran obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and an obligation to reciprocate. Something reminiscent of each of these obligations can be seen at ccMixter, butonly if one keeps in mind a cultural norm that governs contemporary Westerngift-giving, namely that these rules, and especially the obligation to reciprocate,must remain concealed. This important difference between the gift-giving of tra-ditional cultures and Western gift-giving practices is indicated by the existence ofthe American expression \"Indian giver\". 27This politically incorrect phrase, which dates from the eighteenth century, originally designated a person whogives a present with the expectation of receiving another present in return, and ithas its origins in the encounters between Western colonists and Native Ameri-cans. The colonists were apparently very surprised that not returning a gift wasconsidered bad manners in the New World. In Western cultures, the obligationto reciprocate is understood as calculating behaviour and as a debasement ofone's altruistic motives, which are supposed to underlie the giving of a present. It is crucial to ccMixter's style of credit-giving, then, that active ccMixter members are not only uploaders of new content. They also review and attribute.Each community member, in other words, combines three roles, each of which iscrucial to the persistence of the practice. These are the roles of remixer, reviewerand genealogist. As long as a core group of community members takes on thetriple role of remixer-reviewer-genealogist, they will work to maintain a pleasantsocial context for remixing. This undercuts the risks of free riding and constructsthe community's own practice as a meaningful one to which it is rewarding tocontribute. What my analysis brought to light, then, is something that differs from the prevalent views on the culture of recorded popular music. It steps away from theview of the recording industry, which tends to take the roles of artist, consumer,and music industry as paradigms for understanding all types of cultural partici-pation. The ccMixter remix practice does not conform to this division of labour.Neither does it share the recording industry's theory of appropriate credit. If ithad, the remixer, the actor who within the practice corresponds most closely tothe artist, would be motivated by the prospects of admiration and nancialreward, but fame and money are little sought after at ccMixter. Likewise, the theory of generalized artistry fails to provide an appropriate framework to understand the dynamics within the ccMixter community. TheccMixter remix practice does not revolve around music lovers' intrinsicallymotivated, unrewarded activity. Instead, ccMixter has its own style of credit-giv-ing, to which attribution, praise and gratitude are central. Many of the writingsof digital technology enthusiasts concern the blurring of the boundaries betweenconsumers and producers. My analysis, however, discards the consumer-versus-producer paradigm altogether. Instead, it draws attention to attribution andreviewing and the role these activities play in preserving cultural participation.163 Bas JansenMy position is quite close to that of the advocates of sharing economies. Like them, I take the issue of what motivates cultural participation seriously. How- ever, there are also major differences between their approach and mine. They areprimarily interested in nding the laws that govern sharing economies in generaland envision a single set of laws that apply to the entire eld of (popular music)culture. By contrast, I have adopted a cultural practices approach. This hasallowed me to gain a much deeper understanding of credit-giving behaviours inspecic contexts. Based upon the ndings case and similarresearch on deejaying and mixtaping, I have come to the conclusion that differ-ent cultural practices have different styles of credit-giving. Each cultural practicehas its own way of allocating credit, which keeps participants motivated andensures the persistence of the practice in question. 28 Finally, my analysis draws attention to the importance of making the analo- gies on which actors rely explicit. In the ongoing copyright debates, remixers areimplicitly caught between two possible analogies. According to the recordingindustry, illegal remixers are best understood as unruly consumers who falselyclaim elements of an artistic status based on their exploitation of another's work.According to the proponents of generalized artistry, they are emancipated con-sumers who can now rightly claim an artistic status. In either case, the remixerfalls somewhere on a spectrum between consumer and artist. As I have shown,these two analogies are insufcient for theorizing the cultural practice of remix-ing as it occurs in the ccMixter remix community. This becomes apparent when abroader range of analogies is invoked, such as the actor-analogy of the reviewerand the analyst-analogy of the genealogist. Notes 1.

CO-OPs focused on the processes of knowl-edge production that take place when artists and academics work together on acommon research question. On the one hand, it aimed at the formation of newtheories within the humanities by initiating hybrid research projects and prac-tices at the intersection of art and science. On the other, the programme encour-aged the artists that were engaged in these projects to reflect upon their experi-ence and the interrelationship between art and science. The starting point for thepartnership between the artists and academics was to explore each other's con-cepts, frames of reference and research methods and to render them productivefor everyone. The artists and academics developed a discursive and visual rela-tionship: through dialogue, exchange and collaboration they explored a subjectthat interests both parties, but which would normally be investigated individu-ally, within their own paradigm. The CO-OPs generated new and unexpected perspectives on contemporary culture and society, notably on globalization, commercialization and mediatiza-tion. These developments have been investigated by numerous disciplines butrarely from the perspective of partnerships in which the arts and sciences oper-ated on an equal footing but from totally different principles. The ultimate aimof the CO-OPs project was to gauge artistic and scholarly thinking and to makeit mutually productive. The underlying concept was that art and science embody- each in their own way - the shared values of a common modern culture. Each169certainly has its own distinct processes, theories and practices, but these are not an autonomous matter that exists in isolation from social, political and culturaldevelopments. The research teams aimed to grasp each other's theoretical andvisual input in order to contribute to the development of a thinking in which theartistic and reflective was united with the scientic and analytical. 3In this sense, the results of the CO-OPs project can serve as empirical and theoretical materialfor new research into, and new theories about, the relationship between the artsand sciences and research into the arts, as is demonstrated in the articles in thisvolume by the members of four teams from the CO-OPs programme. Collaboration between artists and academics can take many forms and may have varied aims. There are artists who seek partnerships in order to gain accessto new technologies and materials that they can employ as an artistic medium.There are also artists who seek a more intensive form of collaboration, and wishto make works of art through a close partnership with scientists by taking part intheir practice. In this more intensive form of collaboration, artists often envisagea social impact: they wish to take part in the social debate on urgent questions.This can be seen in the aforementioned CO-OPs projects in relation to questionsof globalization, commercialization and mediatization. However, the increasing extent to which artists seek collaboration with aca- demia points to a quest among artists for a new relationship to science and tech-nology. Partnerships between artists and scientists/academics therefore raise allsorts of questions, which also played a role within the CO-OPs. What are theimplications if an artist uses brain scans in her work or investigates commercial-ization or solar observatories from an artistic point of view? Does a more inten-sive collaboration between artists and scientists lead to a shift in our perceptionsof art, such as the role of art in the public debate about science? Do artists whomake work within a scientic or technological environment raise new philo-sophical, ethical and cultural questions about science and/or art? Is it actuallypossible for art to contribute to the public debate on the ethical, political andsocial implications of science? All these questions were discussed in the CO-OPsprogramme, although no denitive answers were produced, if indeed that is pos-sible. The questions (and the hesitant answers) give expression to the necessity tocontemplate the role and function of art in relation to science and technology.Our world is a technological world, for which we are all responsible. There is noreason to exclude artists in the formulation of this shared responsibility. The relationship between art and science The relationship between the arts and sciences has changed constantly over thepast two hundred years and is still changing. There has been a long-standingdesire on the part of artists to dene their position in relation to new scientic170 on the need for cooperation between art and scienceand technological developments. In this respect one often hears the cry for restoration of the mythical unity of art and science that was once supposed tohave existed but has now sadly been lost. However, no unequivocal artisticstance in relation to science has emerged; neither have we witnessed a marriageof art and science. The uncertain and changing relationship between art and science is a conse- quence of the fact that it was only in the nineteenth century that art and sciencedenitively parted ways and became the more or less autonomous domains thatwe know today. This growing division of art and science coincided with theexplosive growth of knowledge in all scientic elds and attendant technologicalinnovations. The sciences underwent processes of radical changes in terms ofinstitutionalization and professionalization in the context of the university. Thisnurtured the conviction that \"scientic\" theories should be immune to social,political, religious or aesthetic influences. For many artists (such as John Ruskin, Charles Baudelaire) the divergence of art and science was a reason to formulate entirely distinct aims and methods forart, which were in all respects opposed to those of science and technology. Thearts cultivated an ethos of radical originality under the motto l'art pour l'art. But there were also artists who resisted the separation of art and science. In the twen-tieth century, technology was attributed a mediating function in order to closethe gap between art and science, most evident in the interwar avant-garde move-ments such as futurism, constructivism and surrealism. In the 1950s and 1960sartists showed a great interest in technology as a means of expression. On a moreideological level, technology was also seen as a means to create a new form ofart, as in Constant Nieuwenhuys' neo-avant-gardist project New Babylon (from 1956). In contemporary art the use of all manner of modern (often digital) tech-nologies has become an ineluctable fact. Many works of contemporary art, suchas multimedia installations, would be unthinkable without modern technology. Scientific and artistic research For the CO-OPs programme we sought artists who not only employ scienticand scholarly insights or technological means as a new artistic medium, but whoalso make these insights or means into the subject of their art and who wish toparticipate - as artists - in the public debate about science and technology. Anexample of this within the CO-OPs is the project In principio erat verbum by artist Krien Clevis and neurological researcher Peter Hagoort, which exploredthe interaction of word and image in relation to the phenomenon of fear, andwhere and how this emotion is regulated in the brain. 4In this project the artist made use of brain-scanning technology to carry out her artistic research. Theproject aims to give an artistic answer to what is essentially a scientic question:171 Robert Zwijnenberghow the relationship between word/image/emotion is connected to localized neurological activity. This project demonstrates clearly how art - with its ownvoice and specic media and methods - can have a presence and visibility in the(public) debate about neurological research. Krien Clevis belongs to the growing group of artists who are preoccupied with neurological science. That is not surprising given the results and implicationsof recent neurological research, which shows that all the processes that we havedened for centuries as mental might possibly be simply material processes. Thedistinction between body and mind determined by our Western cultural view-point might well be an illusion. Our belief in man as a \"spiritual\" being requiresrevision in the light of neurological research. Recent neurological research leadsto discussions about free will, and improving mental achievement through med-ication, and to questions such as: are our brains who we are and what does neuro-logical research mean for the law? The characteristics of a brain scan make it immediately apparent why con- temporary artists have become so interested in neurological research and whybrain scans appear in works of art. Brain scans give us cause to contemplate onceagain the problem - both scientic and cultural - of the separation of materialand spirit. Brain scans, and digital medical visualization technologies in general,make visible something that lies far beyond the everyday domain of the visible.Indeed, neurological research is concerned with matters that transcend ourvisual imagination, such as neurotransmission via a synapse. The translation ofneurotransmission into a schematic illustration to support a text on the subjectdoes little to ll the gaping hole in our imagination. The new visual and culturalexperience of making our own brains visually accessible, made possible by mod-ern visualizations technologies, mixes with visually unrepresentable neurologi-cal processes to which brain scans refer. Although contemporary artists and neurological researchers have different starting points and employ different interpretative methods when looking at abrain scan, that does not mean that they are engaged in entirely different activi-ties when they do so. Ethical questions of identity and the philosophical problemof the Cartesian dualism of body and mind also play an important role in mod-ern neurological research. Scientic discourses on the brain often embody anoptimistic belief in our ability to uncover the secrets of the brain. This belief isproblematized in contemporary artistic practice. 5 In principio erat verbum demonstrates wonderfully what it means when processes such as the technologization of the brain are brought into the artisticdomain. It is clear from the evaluation of In principio erat verbum that the scien- tist and the artist place different values on the results of the project. 6A different evaluation of the results is visible in varying forms and degrees throughout theCO-OPs project. This difference makes clear that when scientic research and172 on the need for cooperation between art and scienceresults are brought into the artistic domain it creates meanings for both the sci- entic and artistic domains, the value of which still needs to be better understoodby both parties. Or in other words: the ambiguous results of partnershipsbetween art and science could produce an opening in what is often a polarizedpublic debate. Partnerships between art and science can create an open space fordebate in which there is no question of predetermined positions and hierarchicalrelationships. Social relevance By using brain scans as an artistic medium, artists take yet another importantstep. The biological sciences increasingly appropriate life as their domain, overwhich they claim the voice of authority. This has radical consequences for ourdaily life. Furthermore, the ethical questions raised by the results of biologicalresearch are increasingly dealt with within this scientic discipline. This takesplace, for example, within ethics commissions with the help of standardized pro-tocols that unashamedly exploit the privileged knowledge they have in relationto the concerned citizen. However, viewed from the perspective of the concernedcitizen, the answers and solutions they offer are often driven by economic andpolitical interests; there rarely seems to be room for thoroughgoing and funda-mental ethical reflection within science itself. What is true of the life sciences (thefact that decisions about social applications are increasingly the preserve ofexperts) is also true of the other sciences. There is an ever-growing gap betweenscience and society, which seems to resist all attempts to close it. This gap is char-acterized by mutual misunderstanding. This misunderstanding stems from thecollision between scientic integrity and social concern and suspicion. Scientistsfrequently complain that their scientic integrity - the provision of open andhonest answers and objective scientic solutions to a problem - is undervaluedas a contribution to the public debate and that the public simply possesses insuf-cient knowledge to understand scientic answers and solutions. The gap is alsogrowing because the public debate appears to rest upon a different set of socialand moral values and a different appreciation of benets and risks than thoseemployed in the natural sciences. This means that the public debate is dominatedby stakeholders, interest groups and experts. Artists who deal with issues such as technologization or globalization from an artistic perspective bring these questions back into the cultural and socialdomain, where they actually belong. This enables artists to undertake a criticalinvestigation of all manner of cultural, ethical, aesthetic, social and politicalimplications raised by public concerns. By making public concerns a componentof their work, these artists give artistic form to a public joint responsibility forsolving current social problems. It is wrong to keep questions raised by the sci-173 Robert Zwijnenbergences within the scientic domain, precisely because these questions are formed by society. It is therefore important to attain a signicant degree of sharedresponsibility for the development of, and implications raised by, the sciences,both within the sciences and in society in general. In partnership with scientists,artists can afford the public unique artistic access to the complex new scienticdevelopments, and through their artistic projects they can present urgent socialquestions raised by science and technology. It was the intention of the CO-OPsto contribute to this role of the arts and, furthermore, to demonstrate how artis-tic investigation is an enrichment of academic research. Notes 1.

Kitty Zijlmans, Robert Zwijnenberg and Krien Clevis (Amsterdam: De Buitenkant, 2007), 128-129.174 on the need for cooperation between art and scienceChapter Thirteen Laboratory on the Move in Retrospect Ni Haifeng and Kitty Zijlmans \"Is it then never enough?\" a woman exclaimed, visiting the exhibition The Return of the Shreds in Scheltema, the contemporary art venue of Museum De Lakenhal in Leiden in the summer of 2007, when facing the mountain of nine tons of textile shreds on display. The exhibition was the largest in a series of proj-ects organized by the Chinese-born, Amsterdam-based artist Ni Haifeng and meduring our 18-month collaboration. We called our alliance Laboratory on the Move, indicating the dynamics of our research that was performed in the contextof the experimental artist/scholar collaborations (the \"CO-OPs\") within theTKC research programme. Other exhibitions and presentations we realized (towhich I will come back later) were Gift in BAK, Basis voor Actuele Kunst in Utrecht (2006) and Forms of Exchange in Museum Het Domein in Sittard (2007), where we also invited the Chinese contemporary artist Wang Jianwei toparticipate. 1 Haifeng's and my interest as an art historian working on art of the contempo- rary world is the way in which art and subsequently art history reflects uponprocesses of globalization, today as well as in a historical perspective, but wealso have a common interest in the way art opens up a social space, sets people inmotion - hence the title \"Laboratory on the Move\". In The Return of the Shreds exhibition a specific aspect of globalization, that of the global - yet in terms oflabour unequal - interconnectedness of the production of material goods (in thiscase, textiles), was visualized by means of - literally - a mountain of shreds,which represented the weekly waste product of a small textile factory in China.Other installations included \"typical\" Chinese products such as tea, porcelainand spices, or cast bronze shoes alluding to the protectionism of the Europeantrade market, but also turned-in old passports resulting from a newspaperannouncement requesting Dutch citizens to participate in our project byresponding. All works of art dealt with specific themes ruling our contemporary175world (labour division, logistics, trade agreements, protectionism, money flows, travel of people, bureaucracy, power relations) as well as issues of representa-tion: what is represented and what does it stand for? The underlying theme of theexhibition The Return of the Shreds was transfer: the transportation, exchange, and conveyance of things and thoughts between nations, cultures, and people.These movements on a worldwide scale are the effect of the globalization oftrade, the international market, and the global financial system. Moreover, theyhave a profound influence on the (unequal) division of labour on a world scale.As a country with cheap labour, China produces cheap clothing for an eagerEuropean market. The lady at the exhibition got the message. Moreover, the exhibition was a journey in itself, allowing one to discover an unknown yet familiar world: the materials and objects are all known to us, butwere modified: shards instead of crockery; bronze shoes; leftover shreds rags (see utensils inChinese bearers of memory rather than aspapers for identification; photographs seemingly depicting mansions in HongKong whereas in reality they were shot on a film set, showing film props. All thetime the immediate recognition (identification) was there but then the ambiguityfiltered through and set the mind in motion: where did I end up, to what culturalsystems do the works refer? It is the simultaneous creation and obliteration ofmeaning Ni aims at, while drawing attention to the cyclical movements of peo-ple, products and goods that are often reflective of patterns of colonialism andglobalization. 2He achieves this through his playful use of material; it is the works of art that get to work. Looking back and reflecting on our collaboration, what did the collaboration bring us, and more significantly, what boundaries did we transgress? Whatknowledge practices and forms were generated and what kind of space wasopened by working together as an artist and an art historian? In this retrospec-tive we discuss and assess aspects of and insights into interdisciplinary collabora-tion, modes of research, and the (social) spaces created in the exhibitions. Thefocus will shift from our working together to the visitors' encounter with theworks. On transdisciplinarity What characterized our collaboration? At its best, collaboration can be inventiveand generate openness towards each other, even leading to forms of novelty. AsAndrew Barry, Georgina Born and Gisa Weszkalnys in their article \"Logics ofInterdisciplinarity\" (2008) 3declare, a variety of different types of relations between disciplines can be distinguished. The idea of a discipline opens up anexus of meanings, disciplinary methods and concepts, and consequently, inter-176 laboratory on the move in retrospectdisciplinarity (or rather transdisciplinarity) implies a variety of boundary trans- gressions. In our case, what would be the boundary transgression between art-practice-based research and that of art history? Our key word may well be com-mensurability. In discussing the CO-OPs programme with Caroline Nevejan, 4she pointed out a number of aspects that are essential to successful interdisciplinary collabo-ration. First and foremost one must have a sense of the necessity to collaborate.A firm basis for collaboration implies a relationship formed by mutual trust andgood will, and the creation of a social interface, a space of interaction, in whichthe actors know the codes and have a certain fluency in language. Within variousdisciplines words and concepts may mean different things, and this needs to beclarified. How do words act? Nevejan distinguished four types of collaborationin the CO-OPs project, which consisted of seven teams, each composed of anartist and an academic scholar 5: (1) inventing together and thus sharing one space of play, of action (especially Werner/Somsen, see also in this volume); (2)developing a new language together 6; (3) complementing each other (Ni/Zijl - mans); (4) not really working together, that is, working more or less at cross-pur-poses. 7In the case of Ni Haifeng and myself, Nevejan typified the collaboration as one of equality, as one of being well matched on the basis of a shared ontology,that is, consenting both to a set of concepts and the relationships between thoseconcepts. At the start of the collaboration, by reading each other's texts (andfrom my part, first of all my prior knowledge of Ni Haifeng's art), and in discus-sions and exchanges, a common ground of understanding was forged. Another aspect that stimulated the collaboration was the setting, the actual context of the projects. This was especially the case with Werner/Somsen's inter-action with the astronomical observatories (see their contribution to this collec-tion), and in our case the Scheltema building, the venue of The Return of the Shreds exhibition. The nineteenth-century Scheltema building's former function as a textile factory inspired Ni Haifeng to turn to textiles for problematizing theimpact of a globalized world. But there were more connections. For many cen-turies Leiden was a textile town and it was the cloth industry that brought itprosperity in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. De Lakenhal, since 1874 amuseum housing the municipal collection of artistic and historical artefacts, wasbuilt in 1640 by the renowned Dutch architect Arent van 's Gravensande for thetesting, measuring and pressing of the woollen cloth in \"the Laeckenhalle\" (liter-ally the hall of cloth ). But De Lakenhal not only testifies of the heritage of the textiles industry. It also houses Chinese porcelain artefacts brought to theNetherlands by the Dutch East India Company's ships to supply the Dutchimport market (the Dutch East India Company can be regarded as the world'sfirst PLC, something Ni always emphasizes because it reflects the Dutch businesssense). The installation Shrinkage 10% in the exhibition The Return of the177 Ni Haifeng and Kitty ZijlmansShreds alluded in a playful way to the former Chine de Commande crockery, but because of its parody on manufacture also to discussions on \"Made in China\" (then and now), on original and reproduction (of vital importance in museumcircles), and the museum as framework because what were once mass-producedplates, cups and saucers are now seen as (singular) and esteemed museum pieces.In this respect, this installation also connected the (collection of the) Lakenhal(Chinese porcelain) with the Scheltema exhibition (the shrunken replicas of La - kenhal pieces). 8 A further concern regarded the claim of novelty of transdisciplinary collabo- ration. One goal of some art-science collaborations, so Andrew Barry et al. convey, is not so much to render art or science more accountable - a frequently heard demand with respect to interdisciplinary research, especially when art isinvolved; rather, it is to challenge and transform existing ways of thinking aboutthe nature of art and science (academia), as well as the relations between artistsand scientists/academics and between the objects and diverse publics. In ourcase, the aspect of novelty comes closer to what Barry et al. call a \"heightenedawareness of what is potentially inventive\" regarding the way in which creatingspaces for experiencing the effects of globalization act on the visitor. 9 Our project wasn't focused on problem solving by joining forces, but on highlighting a sense of responsiveness, both physically and mentally, to what is happening inour globalized world. I fact, this can be viewed as our tertium comparationis , our common ground of interest on the basis of which our collaboration was viable.By means of the installations, rather than being told about globalization, peoplecould feel its existence. They could touch and smell it, and they were incited torelate to the installations with their whole body and mind. In that respect the artworks are sites rather than they are objects, and in the end social relations werewhat was aimed for, an art form that addresses the politics of everyday life. 10It provided a view of globalization from the inside out, and one barely allowing adistancing from it. First because globalization concerns us all and this installa-tion incited us to face the facts, and secondly because of its physical presence. Itcreated, as Bruno Latour suggests, a particular subject/object connection whichcan be characterized as a \"collective experimentation about what humans andnonhumans together are able to swallow or to withstand\". 11Before we go deeper into this framing of subject/object relationships, we will briefly expandupon the artistic mode of research in reciprocal processes of reflexivity. Two modes crossing Interdisciplinarity draws from at least two modes of thinking, one of which, inour case, is the way in which the artist thinks visually and which has a practice-oriented basis in doing, acting, building. The artist processes his own unique178 laboratory on the move in retrospectvisual language. In the act of creation, ideas come to the fore and things are cre- ated that were not there before. For this a plethora of modes of research is possi-ble, in line with the idiosyncrasy of the artist. Art produces its own modes, butother modes may be borrowed from any realm or discipline, and applied oradapted. Ni Haifeng is just as concerned with the process in time and the trajec-tory the research takes as he is with the outcome. Whereas research is predomi-nantly geared towards knowing something, art is geared towards creating. Thehuman mind is always under construction, Ni expounds in a conversation wehad prior to this text; the artist is not just concerned with cognition, but ratherwith images, visuality and feelings. The artist's mode of working and developingis a more sensory, hybrid one - a subversive approach that is geared towardsuprooting. Conversely, the academic acts more rationally and draws on abstrac-tion based on facts and fact finding, on recognition and confirmation. 12Ni Haifeng's response in an email exchange to the two modes of thinking/actingruns as following (which I include verbatim): I think the two modes are comparable to poetry and essay writing. Poetry by its nature leaves a lot unsaid, but strives to render visible the unsayable. Theshreds are just a material presence of the unsayable. An essay is, above all, asolid construction and it has to say all that is sayable. But for us it is importantto find the moments when the two modes cross each other, when the boundaryof the two becomes blurred and when we find ourselves thinking simultane-ously or alternately in two very different modes (not you adopt mine and Iyours). I especially choose the word \"moments\", because in the end you con-tinue to be an art historian and I an artist, but it doesn't mean those transgres-sions are transient or insignificant, rather those moments determine the natureand the outcome of our collaboration. I could well imagine a way of making artthat is theoretically based, as well as a poetic theory; or simply theoretical ele-ments in art and poetic elements in theory. But I just can't pinpoint what can becategorised as such during our collaboration. Maybe we should look at our very initial idea of \"Laboratory on the Move\", taking it not only as an open enclosure (because there is not a fixedplace for the lab) for research but also as a field. The field maybe that of thesocial, since our aim was the social intercourse in different places and settings.Here I am thinking of the project Giftat BAK and Forms of Exchange in Het Domein [see below], and to a lesser degree of The Return of the Shreds, in which some pieces had this aim. Perhaps, at this point, we should not be look-ing at the pieces, but the events, the social interactions we staged together. In sodoing and in those moments, I am not so much an author of an art work andyou are not so much your \"usual self\"; we are both creators of the events.\"Role shifting\", we talked about it before, not comically switching roles, but179 Ni Haifeng and Kitty Zijlmansboth shifting to something else. In that I become an observer of my own work, put to the test in a real social environment, and you become a field practitionertesting your theoretical and art-historical framework. I think there are two parallel lines of concern that we share or which we developed during our collaboration: one is the notion of the social and theother is globalisation. The latter is the anchor of The Return of the Shreds. Although the individual pieces are still made in an \"art\" way, it might be saidthat I adopted a scholarly approach in marking out the context; or maybe thehistorical dimension of some pieces is indebted to your scholarly methodologyof looking in our momentary \"shifting\". These two parallel lines are intercon-nected, or at least they cross each other at certain moments and at certainplaces. Here I am thinking of Forms of Exchange. There must be some rele- vance to a global art-historical perspective, to field-study: two very differentimaginings of social reciprocity, social interaction and art object-human rela-tions. I am also thinking of the Passport project, which is again a field practice, collecting the \"remnants\" of people's movements and border crossings. Themovement of human beings is one of the main agencies of globalisation, butour aim is perhaps to emphasise that this agency has been set in motion longbefore \"globalisation\" became a paradigm. As with many pieces in The Returnof the Shreds and also, as you mentioned above, we are also concerned with the historical dimension of globalisation. Globalisation has been a very longprocess throughout human history, until capitalism shifted to a single market. We tried to make visible our thinking and our research, not just translating thinking in a visual form, but creating a heightened visibility, a shortcut anddirectness of our research to its \"end user\". That is certainly the case withForms of Exchange. Laboratory on the Move In the above Ni Haifeng stresses in particular the social dimension of the projects Gift, Passports, and Forms of Exchange. Picking up on this train of thought, I think that what was set into motion was in part caused by the performativequality of the objects. These also affected me, given that I was operating as a\"participant observer\" from within an art project in which social interactionwas the pivot. What might this new position imply for practising art history?Generally, I am the subsequent theoretical recipient and not the simultaneousparticipant-collaborator. How does material communicate? How does it affecta person? In all three projects, the exchange of physical objects was the centralmotor, and all three alluded to social interactions, people's sense of identifi-cation/identity, and to mutual bonding. In all three art projects, a context wascreated in which objects moved from one hand to the other, creating a space for180 laboratory on the move in retrospectsocial interaction. In that respect, reality was produced. Gift (BAK, Utrecht, December 2006) built on a previous project by Ni Haifeng entitled Art as Gift commissioned by the City of Amsterdam to accom- pany the process of naturalization of migrants and to mark \"Naturalization Day\", the day \"new\" Dutch citizens receive their residence permit. Ni Haifengdecided to award a gift to those who are striving to obtain Dutch nationality (seefigures 15 and 16). After all, the notion of Amsterdam being a tolerant and hos-pitable city throughout history contrasts sharply with present-day politics whichaim to strengthen national borders and to stop the free flow of human beingsacross those borders. Art as Gift for this unique occasion was an art installation of which the parts came from the \"new\" land. Pieces of stone, brick and wood -the building materials of the city of Amsterdam - and as a representative of basicDutch food, the potato, were cast as porcelain objects and hand-painted withtraditional Chinese motifs (blue on white). Together they form a huge installa-tion, which extends physically and in time because the pieces are distributed toAmsterdam's new citizens as a gift from the city. Each object tells you that it ispart of something larger, a social construction, the Dutch nation-state, but eachpiece is also unique. The porcelain potato was accompanied by a little booklet inthe exact format of a passport bearing a welcoming text for the newcomers. For the CO-OPs' kick-off in BAK we mimicked this project by presenting a critical version of this work, which questions what it actually means to own apassport, what kind of freedom it provides and who are the \"lucky\" ones. Afterall, a passport comes with a set of rules; furthermore, it may show to whom thebearer belongs, but not who he or she is. The concept of the nation-state impliesa unified place and a unified people, whereas it is in fact an invented place and animagined community. Crossing borders also means, as Ni once remarked, that one is thoroughly scrutinized and gazed at intensely as if one's whole being coin-cides with the document's set of quantifiable data. At the launching of the CO-OPs project all those who were present were invited to take a porcelain object and the accompanying (in this case) grey pass-port, reflecting a more critical view of state citizenship than that in Art as Gift . Also, it was bestowed on a different group. Instead of the aforementioned groupof immigrants to the Netherlands, the passport and porcelain sculpture (thepotatoes were especially popular) were distributed to Dutch citizens of the Netherlands, thus connecting the former group to the latter. I remember wellpeople selecting the object by touch, and how much they appreciated their \"sec-ond\" passport, with a hint at the political arousal caused by members of parlia-ment (the populist right-wing PVV Party) earlier that year denouncing col-leagues who had immigrated to the Netherlands while retaining two passports.With this allegation the antagonists cast doubt on the loyalty to the Dutch stateof representatives with a migrant background. As such the work Gift had an181 Ni Haifeng and Kitty Zijlmansimmediate political connotation. As a social event it retains its effect as object for reflection and recollection, and because it connects \"new\" Dutch with \"Dutch\"Dutch. It was, as Haifeng suggests in the above text, new for me to be co-produc-ing an art project that was simultaneously an object of study, i.e. an art form thatextends in time, produces social interactions and which, as a new art form, chal-lenges the discipline to discuss it and relate to it. There is yet another subtext to the project. The origin of the discipline of art history runs parallel with the creation of the nation-state in the nineteenth cen-tury. The Netherlands is no exception to the rule. In the context of an emergentsense of Dutch national cultural identity, which, together with the rise of Dutchnationalism, occurred predominantly in the second half of the nineteenth cen-tury, museums were founded for the preservation of Dutch art (particularly thatof the \"Golden Age\") and the discipline of art history began to take shape.Nationalism and the discipline of art history are deeply intertwined. This corre-lation makes it ideologically and politically loaded, celebrating Dutchness,which is rooted in the glorious past of a seagoing nation with a strong merchantnavy and imperialist aims. More than a century later the world has changed sig-nificantly. In an era of migratory flows and a more rapid globalization than everbefore, nationalism is challenged: what is Dutch culture, what is in our muse-ums, what and whose heritage are we preserving, how does Holland positionitself in the European Union, in the world? In a global world the study of artchanges accordingly. It is therefore of paramount importance to question criti-cally the parameters of the discipline of art history and thoroughly revise it. Myaim for an art history in a global perspective (or a world art studies 13) emerged out of this awareness, and projects such as Gift and its follow-ups Used Pass- ports14and Forms of Exchange, challenge as art and hence confront art history to evaluate themes such as the nation-state/nationalism versus cultural identityand sense of belonging; in my opinion art history is part and parcel of this field oftension. To \"field-study two very different imaginings of social reciprocity: social interaction and art object/human relations\", as Haifeng mentions above, indeedhas relevance for a global art-historical perspective. It provokes the art historianto reposition herself as a global citizen with a global responsibility. Throughimperialism, world trade, and colonialism, European countries have had a hugeimpact on the shape of the world today. In the age of post-post-colonialism andchanging economic power balances the \"old world\" has to reposition itself. Artplays a role in this, in the whole range from cultural identity marker, criticalcomment and aesthetic reflection to a growing marketable product. This \"artand agency\" (to borrow the title of Alfred Gell's seminal book of 1998) was cen-tral to the project Forms of Exchange (2007). Ni Haifeng and I re-installed the work Gift and again the audience was182 laboratory on the move in retrospectinvited to come and pick out a porcelain object and accompanying passport. Within an hour the boxes were cleared out and in some cases people's pocketswere bulging with porcelain potatoes. The installation Input/Output by Wang Jianwei, however, was built on a different strategy. Wang is a well-known artistfrom China and friend of Ni Haifeng and was invited by us to participatebecause of his installations alluding to gift exchange and matters of reciprocity.In Wang's case, instead of just taking a free object, you were asked to leave some-thing personal behind in return for one of the squeaky pink rubber ears. The con-tainer with ears emptied as the other one filled with items - knickknacks or care-fully chosen pieces - left by people. Wang has installed this work in variousplaces throughout the world and each time visitors' behaviour is different: inhow they respond, in what they leave as exchange goods, in how they appreciatethe work. Dorothea von Hantelmann refers to this social and political functionof art as \"art's conventionalized ways of production, presentation and experi-ence in which very basic constitutive parameters of modern societies are keptand cultivated\". 15The objects (porcelain sculptures, passports and ears) set peo- ple in motion, often mirroring distinct cultural contexts. The relationship between people and objects (or in Bruno Latour's words between humans and non-humans) creates a social reality: how do humans actwhen enticed by \"non-humans\"? In Input/Output greediness won out over mod- esty; the implied etiquette was that each person should take one object but it wasnowhere precisely spelled out. Without such rules, antisocial behaviour rearedits head. At home or with friends the owner can brag about his boldness. At thesame time, the visitors were all part of a work of art, actually performing it. Theobject and the person have a reciprocal impact: what do objects do, what is their agency? How do they produce social reality? The functioning of, let's say, thepassport is connected to the contribution and particularities of countless otherentities: it has to be designed, tested against counterfeiting, printed (the paperhas to be delivered, the ink, etc.); coded, distributed, assigned to a specific personwho has to be screened, who appropriate photographs that meet stringent crite-ria); the rules have to be set; the passport needs to be acknowledged internation-ally; the numbers have to be registered in order to be checked, which requiresqualified personnel, etc., etc. The holder knows what opportunities are affordedby his or her passport (travel) but as an official state document it also says \"youexist\", you can (actually you have to) identify yourself with it. In mimicking thepassport in an art project and distributing it randomly to people, these rules arebroken, and others are set. You can pass on your passport to anyone you like,forging a bond of friendship perhaps. You can keep it and fool the customs, orput it on display in your house or office. Together with the porcelain potato itforms a tiny installation, not a unique piece for a change, but one part of a largerwhole and this the owner knows. Even by writing this text I again perform the183 Ni Haifeng and Kitty Zijlmansart work. It sets me in motion, again, reflecting upon what a work of art such as this means for, or how it changes art history. Art history still has much to do in exploring the reciprocal relationship, in a Latourian sense, between object and text writing, art work and art history,humans and non-humans. Therein resides a new challenge. In this model art his-tory is performed over and over again, a hands-on art history that steps outsidestudy into the world of art practice and acts and responds from within. Outlook Have we been successful in our enterprise? We could as well have drifted apartduring the process, but that didn't happen. Our contact and the insight into eachother's processes of working intensified. The context created by the project Lab- oratory on the Move offered Ni Haifeng new challenges, working from withinthe framework of a research programme such as Transformations with its theo- retical frames of reference and its aims. As he once said, Ni Haifeng would neverhave realized the projects and installations, nor written about it, if he hadn't feltchallenged by the assignment to work together with an academic in the givencontext of the research programme. Conversely, operating from within a co-cre-ated art project gave an inside view into art practice rarely afforded a theorist.For me, one of the most significant outcomes is the realization of the importanceof understanding art as a field of research ruled by its own set of questions andidiosyncratic methods: one that equals academia. It is my contention that if welook at the three fields in academia, the sciences, the humanities, and social sci-ences, research based on art practice can be seen as a fourth field of knowledgeproduction, a field that is not subordinate to the others, but of equal merit. Andone that can feed academia, just as academic research can fuel artistic research. To understand the significance of art-practice-based research as an independ- ent, yet complementary field of knowledge production with its own frames ofreference, questions, methods, practices and execution, has taken an interestingturn. And one of the incentives for this was supplied by the CO-OPs programme.For a short time now artists can obtain a Ph.D. in the arts at Dutch universitiesconducting research in a self-defined field of artistic practice. This Ph.D. in thearts is supported by both the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(NWO) and the Netherlands Foundation for Visual Arts, Design and Architec-ture (Fonds BKVB), thus continuing the collaboration started during the CO-OPs. 16Acknowledging the impact and scope of the field of the arts and art prac- tice by means of Ph.D.s in the arts is, in my view, a major accomplishment andenriching for academia and the field of art and culture, as well as for society atlarge.184 laboratory on the move in retrospectNotes 1.

Following a request to hand in old passports, more than 150 people from all over185 Ni Haifeng and Kitty Zijlmansthe country took part in this art project. Due to the political debate over the possession of \"two passports\" (as mentioned above) the project gained an unexpected topicality: it high-lighted our concern about (the importance of) our passport. Also it was remarkable howmany people clung to their expired passports and those of their loved ones or deceased fam-ily members. In the show, the first thing the passport owners did was to point out to otherswhere their passport hung, becoming almost emotional about it, as if the expired passportswere pieces of their identity. In fact, they do show the passing of time, as well as the footprintof travel; however, they also portray the bureaucratic side of travelling and migration, towhich the countless visas, stamps, signatures and seals are witnesses. And no one knowsthis better than people who wish to immigrate to the Netherlands. 15.

Education has yet been spared, but most schools and universities arenevertheless managed as a business and marketed as high-performance cars fortop-talented students. Culture itself is increasingly supplied by (semi)privaterms and appropriated by corporate capital, produced for a prot under theconditions of market exchange. In the arts, which have beneted from extensivegovernment support since the 1950s, the Dutch have witnessed a remarkablyrapid shift towards commercial practices and a discourse of cultural entrepre-neurship. Artists are encouraged to turn themselves into brands in order toincrease their revenue-earning capacity. Museums sell these brand names to cul-tural consumers and advertise the attendance gures of blockbuster shows(\"over 50,000 visitors in the opening month\") as if they were movie theatresoperating within a Hollywood-controlled distribution system. 1 What interests me as a social historian in this ongoing process of commercial- ization is its political economy. What are the underlying social dynamics andpower struggles that restructure the transformation of the cultural eld in theNetherlands? Does the \"new order\" of market economics in the non-for-protsector challenge existing social hierarchies and power relations or does commer-cialization reinforce the position of the vested cultural elites? Before discussingthe insights gained by our art-science exploration, which offers only the begin-nings of a systemic understanding of the complex dynamics at work, let meexplicate the central concerns of my research by giving a rough draft of the com-mercial tendencies in the not-for-prot segment of the cultural eld, taking as an187example the nation's major museums for modern art and centres for contempo- rary art. As it draws merely the contours of the commercialization process, mycomposite sketch will inevitably be a simplication of the actual situation, but ithints at the key issues at stake. Most players in the not-for-prot segment of the cultural eld continue to adhere to the seemingly disinterested principle of \"art for art's sake\" or a contemporary\"art-for-society\" version of this ideology whereby art's rationale is still posi-tioned as fundamentally different from the capitalist rationality at work in theeconomic eld. It comes as no surprise then that they frequently complain aboutneoliberal politics and the concomitant economization of the arts. The \"market\"is criticized time and again but at the same time its practices are widely embracedfor institutional advertising and self-promotion. The latter seems in particularthe case with those players who manage the circulation of art, artists and audi-ences in the public domain. Their habitus is intimately tied to the logic of themarket and the media. Much like art dealers, not-for-prot mediators between producers and con- sumers are well aware that media exposure boosts their prestige and expandstheir playground. Hence museum directors and curators play the visibility game.They not only dene, consecrate, distribute and promote art but also sell them-selves, whereby some take on a semi-star status, which facilitates the career oftheir prot\u00e9g\u00e9s as well as their own rise in the (inter)national art scene. Exhibitsoften function as vehicles for upcoming curatorial and artistic talent. With thehelp of publicity campaigns and the media, solo shows of famous and not-yet-famous artists and artistic movement are marketed as must-see events. Ideally,the museum itself develops into a global brand name, like Guggenheim. Whilethe Disneycation of culture is ercely criticized, the Guggenheimiziation of theinternational museum scene encounters less opposition. The \"Bilbao effect\" ismuch sought after, not only by the museum management but also by ambitiouslocal ofcials as museum branding and city marketing go hand in hand. 2 It goes without saying that curatorial practices do not focus solely on main- stream museum audiences, which are primarily composed of highly educatedDutch citizens as well as international tourists. 3Special events and workshops for new audiences, in particular teens and tweens as well as second- and third-generation immigrants, aim at broadening the potential public for art and legit-imize the museum's social function as well as state support. The \"specialists\"(notably curators, artists and cultural theorists) are well served by the centres forcontemporary art, which have earned a reputation of arrogance towards thegeneral public. 4In almost all cases, privileged treatment is given to private and corporate sponsors in order to ensure their nancial loyalty and offer them inreturn a means to build up symbolic and social capital. Museums and art centres188 embedded in the dutch art worldregularly organize exclusive get-togethers for their \"friends\" and \"patrons\" (prosperous friends), such as private previews in the presence of the artist(s),personal newsletters from the artistic director and exclusive art excursions. 5For the next generation of patrons, some of the leading museums for modern and con-temporary art helped to develop the course My First Art Collection , a private ini- tiative which introduces people in the 30-45 age group (especially social climbersfrom immigrant milieus) to the practice of buying art, with visits to art schools andart fairs, information on scal advantages for art collectors and a mock auction. 6 While exhibiting art remains the core business of the museums, a wide range of ancillary services and events inscribes museum visits rmly within a disposi-tive of entertainment and shopping. Vernissages and nissages draw attention to the opening and closing nights of many exhibits, a practice adopted from theworld of commercial art galleries. For instance, in November 2006, a \"specialevening\" marked the end of Street: Behind the Clich\u00e9 at Witte de With in Rotter- dam and the opening of If I Can't Dance I Don't Want to Be Part of Your Revolu-tionat De Appel in Amsterdam. The programme started at Witte de With with a short tour of the exhibition by curator Renske Janssen. Participants then took akaraoke bus to Amsterdam where they attended the vernissage at De Appel. Dur- ing the bus trip, Canadian artist Gareth Moore discussed his month-long stay inRotterdam and the work he created for the Street exhibition. Although opening and closing parties are usually open to the wider public, they primarily serve thein-crowd because personal invitations are distributed only within a limited circle.There is no such thing as a free lunch for the average taxpayers who fund theseparties. However, museum caf\u00e9s are open to all who want to indulge themselves inthe hipness of the contemporary art scene, evoked by design fur niture and trendycooking. In the Flavours Museum Caf\u00e9 in Eindhoven, setting of \"innovative architecture\". 7The Groningen Museum proudly draws attention to the fact that the interior of its restaurant is designed byMaarten Baas. \"The tables, chairs, and settees are made from synthetic clay anddesigned by hand. Every piece in the MendiniRestaurant [sic] is thus unique\". 8 Typically, the museum store operates along similar lines as the museum caf\u00e9. Bothare independent destinations that can be accessed without buying a ticket to themuseum. These days the store no longer sells merely art books, posters and post-cards of the collection and temporary shows, but also a selection of museum mer-chandise, gadgets, toys, design objects and designer fashion. Even within the walls of the exhibition space itself, the boundaries between art and commerce, between aesthetic experience and entertainment are blurred.In 2010, the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen offered \"visitors a unique oppor-tunity to spend a night in the museum\". 9For \u00a4275 to \u00a4450 for two people (including dinner and breakfast), guests could book the installation Revolving Hotel Room by artist Carsten H\u00f6ller. For those who hesitated, the publicity cam-189 Judith Thissenpaign pointed out that \"the Guggenheim Museum in New York exhibited the hotel room last year with great success\". Conforming to the logic of Holly-wood's distribution system, the second run of the show was cheaper than thepremiere in New York City, where prices ranged from $259 (student rate onMonday evenings) to $799 on holiday weekends. On both sides of the Atlantic,the happening was an instant hit and sold out almost overnight. For the nalnight in Rotterdam, which was auctioned off by Boijmans van Beuningen, ananonymous buyer paid \u00a42,010. Of course, the proliferation of commercial discourses and practices in the not- for-prot part of the cultural eld is not specic to the Netherlands, neither is theaestheticization of the economy, which is the flipside of this conspicuous conver-gence between culture and the economy. 10Moreover, it is not a phenomenon without a history. Since the early modern period, culture has been supplied in theform of goods and services produced under the conditions of market exchange.It was only in the nineteenth century that the notion of an \"autonomous\" artisticeld emerged, which was positioned against the commercial orientation of large-scale cultural industries. 11Since then, according to Bourdieu, the opposition between pure art (symbolically dominant but economically dominated) andcommercial art (economically dominant but symbolically dominated) has g-ured as the artistic and ideological benchmark of the cultural eld. Its new logicthereby reproduced, as Bourdieu points out, the opposition between art andmoney that characterizes the eld of power, in which the intellectuals, rich in cultural capital and (relatively) poor in economic capi- tal, and the owners of industry and business, rich in economic capital but (rela-tively) poor in cultural capital are in opposition: on the one hand, a maximalindependence with regards to the demands of the market and exaltation of values of disinterestedness; on the other, direct dependence rewarded with immediate success. 12 However, in the closing decades of the twentieth century, the gap between the cultural eld's founding dogma and the objective practices of those who areinvolved in it, has widened considerably. The boundaries between the culturaleld and the economic eld are more and more blurred. Yet, the present-day con-stellation of the cultural eld is not a mere return to pre-Romantic notions andpatterns of cultural production. For one, the laws of today's global economyentail a homogenization of culture and standardization of taste that are unprece-dented in scope and scale. The centripetal forces of commercialization, bolsteredby new communication technologies and global media networks, are evident inall segments of the cultural eld, including the eld of restricted production(\"high art\"). For another, in most countries which are governed by neo-liberal190 embedded in the dutch art worldeconomic politics, public support for the arts is still largely based upon the eld's presupposed internal dialectic and principles of distinction between pure art andcommercial art, despite a growing emphasis on the \"self-earning capacity\" ofcultural institutions and artists. Hence, the latter nd themselves in a ratherschizophrenic situation: they are prompted to become more \"commercial\" butat the same time they derive their public funding from their position in the eldof restricted production, which is dened by its refusal of the \"commercial\". 13 However, in the end, every single decision to act in one way or another is a mat-ter of personal choice and ethics. Signicantly, it suits the eld as a whole toregard the internalization of economic discourse and practices simply as a conse-quence of pressures from the outside, as if agents and institutions have no agencyat all. What makes the Netherlands a particularly interesting case to research this complex and ongoing process of cultural change is its social and political explo-siveness, which came to the surface after the populist Freedom Party (PVV) ledby Geert Wilders won the parliamentary elections in 2010. This watershed inDutch politics resulted in a minority government of Liberals (VVD) and Chris-tian Democrats (CDA), which introduced unprecedented budget cuts in therealm of high art and artistic experimentation to gain the support of the PVV andsatisfy its populist agenda. 14While Wilders prided himself that the \"left-wing hobbies\" of the cultural and intellectual elite would no longer be publicly fundedin the near future, prominent gures in the eld of contemporary art called for aresponse against the \"Dutch coup d'\u00e9tat in art and culture\". During the newscoverage of the March for Civilization to The Hague (26-27 June 2011), a protest movement organized by \"artists and art lovers\", a new type of Dutch cit-izen was born in the media: the \"cultural activist\". 15Clearly, the term connotes the radical activism of the environmental movement and hints at a fundamentalshift in the position of the arts within Dutch society: public funding for the arts isno longer self-evident. When I started to develop the art-science project Something's Brewing in close collaboration with multimedia artist Edith Abeyta, the widespread populistresentment towards Art and Culture was still buried under a thick layer of tradi-tional Dutch consensus politics. It was by doing this art project that I got a rstsense of the internal forces that fuelled the mechanisms and tendencies that Isketched above and the disruptive potential of the eld's in-group dynamics forsociety at large. Our project started off with a more playful than overtly politicalapproach to the theme of cultural entrepreneurship and the commercializationof everyday life. But rather unexpectedly, we hit a raw nerve. To get a better gripon what was happening, we adjusted the academic objectives of our art-sciencecollaboration: Something's Brewing became an anthropological investigation into the political economy of the Dutch art world. 191 Judith ThissenThe project Edith Abeyta was the artist whose name came almost immediately to my mind when I began to think about a possible partner for the art-science project. Wehad briefly met in Los Angeles in 2004 when I visited Simon Rodia's Watts Tow-ers. Unlike Disneyland's magic castle, the Watts Towers captured my imagina- tion: seventeen structures of steel and mortar decorated with pieces of brokentile, pottery, china, glass, bottles and scrap metal, built by an Italian immigrantconstruction worker in his spare time over a period of more than thirty years(1921-1954). A work of vernacular architecture made of consumer trash, someof the green glass elements still bearing the logos of 7 Up and other soft drinkbrands. An exhibition at the nearby Watts Towers Arts Center featured some ofEdith Abeyta's art - works made with present-day post-consumer cast-offs. I wasinspired by her installations, which, like the Watts Towers, remind us of \"thefailure of consumer capitalism to satisfy, despite the impressions of abundancethat it creates\", as she puts it. I was also struck by the similarities between herprojects and my own research, even though we work in very different contexts.The gap between the precarious living and working conditions of a radical artistand the security of a tenured position at university is enormous and yet in ourwork we pose similar questions about the commercialization of everyday life.The main difference is that I seek to understand its political and social effectsfrom a historical and sociological perspective, while Edith Abeyta is seeking toformulate alternatives to a life that is determined by market forces, looking forways \"to soothe the pain produced by consumer capitalism\". What we had in mind with Something's Brewing was a kind of a crossover between Guerrilla Girls and Negativland. The rst is a group of women whoght sexism, racism and corruption in politics and art \"with facts, humor andoutrageous visuals\", trying with their interventions in the public domain to dis-close the \"understory, the subtext, the overlooked, and the downright unfair\". 16 Negativland is a group of creative anti-corporate activists, who create music,books and visual art using appropriated sound, image and text. Mixing originalmaterials with bits and pieces taken from corporately owned mass culture, theyre-arrange \"these found bits and pieces to make them say and suggest things thatthey never intended to\". 17Combining these two models of artistic activism, we decided to inltrate the Dutch market with our own art beer, turning the prod-uct's generic name in Dutch into a brand name. Free BIER would be provided atcultural events in exchange for promotional display and opportunities for con-versations with the public about subjects ranging from the privatization of cul-ture to the homogenization of taste. 18 Like previous projects by Edith Abeyta, Something's Brewing included collab- orative elements with other artists and the public. Edith Abeyta designed the rst192 embedded in the dutch art worldlabel for BIER, a hand-sewed brown-bag slipover for a standard 33 cl/12 oz beer bottle. In January 2007, an open call was launched to artists, scholars and thewider public to design a label for BIER using the slipover format. Within a fewweeks, we received over fty designs (see gure 17). 19Abeyta and her husband Robert Tower, who is an experienced home brewer, arrived from Los Angeles inApril 2007 to work and live in an artist-in-residency centre in the north of theNetherlands. Three different types of beer were brewed and bottled on location.In total, we produced 780 bottles. Each of them was covered with a machine-sewed paper slipover. We used different designs for the same beer, which greatlyconfused the public, drawing in a simple manner their attention to the standard-ization practices of corporate brewers. On 9 June 2007, BIER premiered in Amsterdam at Imagine IC - a centre for the visual representation of migration and cultures, after an impressive pro-gramme about African roots and cultural identity (see gure 18). Two elderlywomen congratulated us with the results of our rst batch and told us their sto-ries about home brewing in Suriname. Others asked lots of questions about theartists who had collaborated with their designs, treasuring already their slipoveras a little art work and souvenir. Many were surprised that one could make one'sown beer and that it tasted so much better than the standard commercial farethey bought in the supermarket. After Amsterdam, BIER toured the Netherlandsby bike, bus, boat and train. On the island of Terschelling, we sponsored twoconcerts of the Dutch band De Kift during the Oerol theatre festival (see gure19). De Kift's anarchic fanfare music went very well with our Festbier. The band and their fans expressed their frustrations about the commercialization of thealternative music scene but they also shared visions of a society in which DIY-approaches would prevail. Time and again, BIER opened up new horizons. Stu-dents, staff and faculty of Utrecht University met in unexpected ways at an openstudio and tasting event at the Faculty of the Humanities. Something similarhappened a few days later when our Irish Red Ale accompanied a reading of PeteJordan's book Dishwasher at the ABC Treehouse in Amsterdam. Thanks to BIER, tempers calmed down at the CO-OPs conference in Utrecht after a heateddebate about the growing emphasis on competition, protability, and visibilityin the Dutch art world (see gure 20). Finally, we set up a Mobile Research Cen-tre for Beer Culture at the group exhibition Inter-territorial Explorations in Art and Science at the Scheltema Complex in Leiden (29 October 2007 to 20 Janu- ary 2008), which marked the end of the NWO art-science programme. Edith Abeyta's installation and my contribution to the book that accompa- nied the nal group show were our rst efforts to understand the trajectory wehad made with Something's Brewing. 20Because what had started as a playful, participatory exploration of the ways in which the Dutch think about the com-mercialization of everyday life in general and culture, in particular, turned into a193 Judith Thissenstartling discovery of the hidden commercial forces at work in the Dutch art world. Having lived for years in Los Angeles, one of the most ambitious, com-petitive cities in the United States, Edith Abeyta was struck by the constant strug-gles we had to engage in to maintain control over our project. She had notexpected such a erce resistance to her artistic practice in a country where thearts are so generously sponsored by the state. With the advantage of hindsight, Iwill try to decipher in this essay why our ideas, practices and position-takingsclashed with the prevailing norms of production and the expectations of theeld, exasperating the people with whom we worked. \"When Hegemony Just Won't Do!\" Initially, the CO-OPs curator and communications advisor (hereafter: themanagement team) who were charged with the fundraising, PR and day-to-daymanagement of the art-science programme on behalf of the Netherlands Organi-sation for Scientic Research supported Something's Brewing with great enthusi- asm. At Utrecht University, our art-science project was received with a similarkind of eagerness, which surprised me somewhat because of the small amount ofthe grant, the nancial and PR-risks involved (de facto we were running an ille-gal brewery) and the uncertainty of its scholarly outcome. But my academic andpractical concerns were superseded by the project's potential promotional value.Abeyta and I found the over-enthusiastic reception rather amusing and over-looked its deeper implications, namely, that media exposure was a major issuefor the cultural and academic institutions involved in the CO-OPs programme.For NWO and the universities, the art-science projects created opportunities tooffer the broader public a more tangible and accessible image of humanitiesresearch. This is a legitimate PR investment as long as it does not come into con-flict with fundamental values of intellectual freedom and academic integrity. Weencountered no problems on this front, except for one serious incident whichinvolved the programme's academic director (see below). By contrast, we hadseveral conflicts with the management of the CO-OPs programme and the direc-tor-curator of the arts centre that hosted our project. I will single out twomoments of crisis, using Bourdieu's sociological framework to understand thedynamics at work during these struggles. As Bourdieu points out, in moments ofcrisis, \"the objective reality of each of the positions [in the eld] and their rela-tionship is unveiled and the values which do the veiling are reafrmed\". 21It goes without saying that my analysis is not necessarily shared by the other partiesinvolved. The rst moment of crisis I want to discuss relates to a major disagreement with the curator and communications advisor for the CO-OPs programme. Itoccurred in an early stage of the project and concerned the issue of corporate194 embedded in the dutch art worldsponsorship. When we had worked out our initial concept, I was invited to dis- cuss the sponsoring of the overall art-science programme by Heineken. Ourproject was to serve as the bait for this big sh. We found it rather na\u00efve of themanagement team to expect that Heineken, a company known for its obsessionwith \"illegal\" appropriations of its brand identity, would be interested in spon-soring a project that appropriated the cultural practices of corporate beer brew-ers via parody and pastiche. Moreover, colleagues at Utrecht University hadwarned me that in the past Heineken had shown little respect for academic free-dom and corporate interests prevailed over the benets of sharing knowledge.Abeyta was very concerned: In no way should our project be altered, influenced or affected because one of the largest corporate brewers in the world is going to sponsor the event. I don'texpect Heineken to be keeping tabs on us as we are a microscopic organism butI also don't want to be asked or feel pressure to pander or not have a critique ofthem because they are providing free beer ... Our strength as a project/ team isthat we are small, resourceful, flexible and can move and make decisionsquickly as well as being inclusive, participatory and delicious. Maybe it isbecause of my punk rock roots and particular political leanings and influencesbut to be crass, \"screw\" the beer sponsor. One constantly has to negotiate thecorporatization of one's life. Sometimes we have to give them our money but inmost cases they can be circumvented, ignored and sabotaged. I want our proj-ect to be defined by us not in response to the organizers or a beer sponsor. 22 On the other hand, working with a large corporate brewer could be an interest- ing experience, in particular from an academic perspective, considering that thenal aim of Something's Brewing was to gain a better insight into the process of commercialization. Instead of carefully weighing the pros and cons of getting Heineken involved, the CO-OPs management team expected us to comply in advance to whatever\"reasonable\" requests the company would make: serve their beer during publicevents, use the Heineken logo on publicity materials, or organize a party exclu-sively for the benet of the sponsor and its guests. It was kindly suggested thatwe also conceal our critique of corporate capitalism from the company's view. Asthis case suggests, the collective disavowal of economic interests, which remainsa strong governing principle in the artistic eld, no longer automatically entailsthe exaltation of artistic autonomy and maximum independence from thedemands of the market. Tellingly, the CO-OPs curator and communicationsadvisor rejected outright our condition for sponsorship by any brewer: the dona-tion of a few thousands non-labelled bottles to be used for BIER. Such sponsor-ship in kind would considerably reduce our production costs and it would be195 Judith Thissenenvironment-friendly because these standard bottles could be recycled via the supermarket return system. Our request was considered \"unreasonable\" be - cause it would allegedly block any fundraising activity within the beer industry.Why exactly our request created an unworkable situation was never explained.It was a \"matter of common sense\". However, as Gramsci has taught us, com-mon-sense values should never be taken for granted. What seems \"natural\" isoften a consent resulting from hegemonic efforts on the part of those in power.Dominant groups in society seek to prevent systemic change by persuading sub-ordinate groups to identify their own good with the good of those in power. Thusthe status quo is maintained. In the end, the ill-considered fundraising plan turned out to be merely wishful thinking. Nonetheless, the conflict revealed to us that public funding is no safe-guard against capitalist thinking. The CO-OPs management team swiftly discard-ed prevailing notions of autonomy in order to get additional nancing and mediaexposure, which a big corporate sponsor like Heineken would obviously gener-ate. All in all, the discussion about sponsorship was more about logos and brandidentities than about art or science. Disregarding the participatory and DIY qual-ity of our project, the director-curator of our host institution even suggested weabandon the idea of different labels for BIER and stick to a single \"hip design\" inorder to reinforce its brand image and identity. Thus BIER would be in a betterposition to attract public attention and compete with Heineken during CO-OPsevents. Perhaps even more revealing about the eld's political economy than thecommercial logic of our not-for-prot partners was the fact that during the discus-sion about Heineken's potential sponsorship, it turned out that Edith Abeyta andI would have no input into the use of these extra funds. All the money would havegone directly into the \"general budget\" for promotional and curatorial activitiesrather than being distributed among the art-science teams according to theirneeds, as we suggested. In sum, the political economy was fully in favour of the\"middlemen\" - to use a term from Bourdieu's analysis of the cultural eld. Inside knowledge of funding schemes for the arts and the ensuing control over the CO-OPs funds constituted the power base of the programme's managersrather than recognized expertise in the realm of curatorship or PR communica-tions for the arts. According to gures provided by NWO, the total cost of theCO-OPs programme amounted to \u00a4474,054. Half of this sum came from exter- nal parties: private foundations (\u00a471,500) and public sponsors (\u00a4167,500). 23 NWO allocated 60% of the working budget directly to the seven research teams,each of which received \u00a442,000. The remaining \u00a4180,000 covered the fees forthe management team and the cost of their promotional activities for the overallprogramme, such as the website, exhibition catalogue, launch and closingevents. Despite their seemingly disinterested commitment to the arts, these g-ures suggest that middlemen working in not-for-prot contexts operate very196 embedded in the dutch art worldmuch like their commercial counterparts. The distribution of budget allows them to impose their own interests, potentially securing considerable symbolicprots if not economic benets for themselves. After our refusal to collaborate on the corporate sponsorship scheme, Edith Abeyta and I were at best casted as uncooperative or subversive, but more oftenwe were simply ignored. As Bourdieu points out, \"those in dominant positionsoperate essentially defensive strategies, designed to perpetuate the status quo bymaintaining themselves and the principles on which their dominance is based ...The dominant are drawn toward silence, discretion and secrecy\". 24From the perspective of the curator and communications advisor, we were obviously notwilling to play by the rules. More accurately: as outsiders to the tightly-knit,closed system of the subsidized contemporary art eld in the Netherlands, we didnot know the local subtleties of the game. 25Yet, we learned them the hard way. When hegemony works A summary of the material conditions under which Edith Abeyta had to workduring her art residency is necessary to understand in what context we began tograsp the range of veiling mechanisms and deceptive practices that can bebrought into play to protect the modus operandi in the eld of subsidized art andrectify what Bourdieu called \"the heresies of the newcomers\". 26 The project was hosted by an artist-run residency and exhibition space situ- ated in a geographically rather isolated provincial town, some 90 km fromUtrecht. We had preferred a more central location, but it was hard to nd a placewhich could also accommodate the brewery. Abeyta agreed to the location sug-gested by the CO-OPs curator on the proviso that the foundation would help herintegrate the project in the local community - a vital proviso because she meantto involve the general public in her art making. However, shortly before the resi-dency started, we were informed that the director-curator of the centre would beabroad for several months. One day per week, an unpaid intern with no curator-ial or management experience was replacing her. This was the beginning of aseries of unpleasant surprises. We discovered that the residency deal, which wasmade with the CO-OPs curator, stipulated a so-called \"bilateral payment\" con-struction, in which we were invoiced \u00a42,000 for using the accommodation in exchange for receiving a \u00a42,000 working budget to be used for an exhibition onthe site. 27We never saw any of that money. More importantly, the studios were not at all equipped for artists working with traditional materials. The artscentre lacked tools, facilities and nancial resources to buy art supplies. Finally,Edith Abeyta and Robert Tower knew they had to share the large complex forseveral weeks with a dozen art students from the Gerrit Rietveld Academie for197 Judith Thissenne arts and design. However, no space was designated for our project and upon arrival they had to gure out themselves where they could work and install thebrewery. Abeyta set up a public studio in the adjacent exhibition space (see gure 21). Thus, people could come in to discuss the project and participate in the art mak-ing for the installation event that would mark the end of her residency. After arather frustrating start, the project began to work out as we expected. We bene-ted from the kindness of the intern, who spent a lot of her own time on the proj-ect, and two students who were willing to give a hand whenever needed. Then,out of the blue, the residents were notied that the building with the exception ofthe exhibition space had to be vacated within ve days for long-planned demoli-tion and renovation works. It turned out that the foundation was involved in abitter conflict with the public housing association which owned the building andthat the future of the arts centre was at stake. I don't think that the artists-in-res-idence were deliberately used as a kind of human shield in this battle against thedemolishers but there is no doubt that our project had been knowingly put atrisk. We saw no other option than to relocate everything to Utrecht University (see gure 22). However, when we arrived to pack and move our possessions, thedoors were blocked. The director-curator of the arts centre had flown inovernight from the Caribbean (money seemed no longer an issue) to prevent usfrom accessing our intellectual property, claiming that the beer and the art forthe exhibition belonged legally to the foundation. We were also told that by can-celling the exhibition we were jeopardizing the centre's existence. Little by littlethe mystery behind this overreaction unravelled. Without informing us, thefoundation had applied for a grant for Something's Brewing. One of the condi- tions for the grant was a local exhibition. The Netherlands Organisation for Scientic Research, which had fully funded our project, was threatened by the centre's director-curator with a nancial claim of several thousand Euros. 28After hours of negotiation, Edith Abeyta and I were nally granted access to the build-ing to pick up personal belongings, the brewery equipment, art supplies and art.Most of the beer would be picked up later because it could not yet be transported(that would ruin the fermentation process). To liberate our property, we donated100 bottles of BIER to the art centre and Abeyta consented to the one-day use ofa 10-m-wide banner reading \"When Hegemony Just Won't Do!\", which she hadmade in response to the earlier conflict about sponsorship. Pressed by the cir-cumstances, we also reluctantly agreed that to full the grant requirements, thecentre could organize a public presentation of our project and serve our beer butwithout using the BIER slipover labels. A fake exhibition about our project was skilfully arranged by the centre's director-curator, who is an artist herself. In addition to the banner, the show198 embedded in the dutch art worldincluded all the beer cases that had been left on location and a video installation running an interview with Abeyta and her husband made a few weeks earlier byinterns of the programme's communications advisor (see gure 23). Both thebeer and the images of the interview were used without our consent. Worse yet,the short statement which we had written to explain to the audience why we hadrefused to put on an exhibition was used to mislead the public and suggest thatthe show was Abeyta's work after all. This set-up was strengthened by the partic-ipation of the academic director of the CO-OPs programme, an art history pro-fessor. He had agreed to open the show despite his detailed knowledge of the sit-uation. Considering the specialist position that art historians occupy in thecultural eld, his very presence at the opening event produced an effect of conse-cration and thus helped to hush up the actual state of affairs for the sponsors ofthe foundation. But there was more to it. After having read our statement, theprofessor converted the opening event into a work of art, by explaining thatprovocation and confusion is what art is all about. At the same time, our state-ment was projected on the wall of the exhibition space and thus visually inte-grated into the installation by the director-curator-artist. Radical attempts atsubversion are part of avant-garde practices since Duchamp. However, in thiscase, it was a rather extreme form of symbolic violence used against an artistwho refused to play the game. The fake exhibition was staged for just one afternoon: long enough to take the photographs needed to justify the grant. A few relatives, friends, and stu-dents from the Rietveld Academy were part of the cover-up operation. They g-ured as extras amidst the beer cases, video screens and other props (as if it were ascene in a Hollywood B-movie). Altogether, the show and the beer attractedabout 20 people. A freelance journalist, whom we had paid, covered the after-noon for the sake of evidence. Edith Abeyta observed everything in silence andincognito, as she neither presented herself nor was introduced to the public (adeliberate choice on both sides). For insiders, her presence might have added tothe confusion. The group show which marked the end of the art-science programme repli- cated the fake exhibition in several respects, although this time the setting was apremiere arts venue in a major city and the exhibition ran for almost twomonths. There was no apparent curatorial investment from the CO-OPs curatoror the host institution. As a team, we were merely assigned a number of squaremetres in the exhibition space. We did not have the slightest idea of the show'soverall concept. Correspondence about our contribution regarded practicalitiesor publicity. Fullling the visibility requirement stipulated by most externalsponsors of the CO-OPs programme seemed the main rationale behind this exhi-bition. Alternatively, one could see the show as a pretext to publish a catalogue,thus offering the scholars a platform to turn their investment into a legitimate199 Judith Thissenacademic output. The potential or intended audience for either undertaking remained unclear. It was certainly not an issue for discussion or reflection. At thefestive opening night, the show seemed a success. However, insiders knew onlytoo well that the space was primarily crowded with friends and colleagues of theparticipating artists and academics. A professional photographer documentedthe vernissage in detail. In the weeks after the opening, neither the press nor the general public showed much interest. According to a guard, a total of less thanve visitors per day was the rule. By way of conclusion While we planned with Something's Brewing to offer a playful alternative to the logic of corporate capitalism, our project ultimately was perceived as an attemptto question the rules of the Dutch art eld. In the end, however, this is not whatwas really at stake and all parties involved (including ourselves) unconsciouslyunderstood that only too well. Edith Abeyta's art not merely questions the rulesof the game which is played in the eld of contemporary art. Rather, she ques-tions with her do-it-yourself and participatory approach the game itself and thebelief system that supports it. As Bourdieu points out, \"this is the one unforgiv-able transgression\". 29The eld of restricted cultural production operates like a church. You are either in or out. There is no room for disbelievers. The question has to be raised how representative this case is for what is going on in the Dutch art scene. I have no clear-cut answer. The not-for-prot segmentof the cultural eld stands out for its lack of transparency (especially as nancesare concerned), self-congratulatory practices and coercive strategies aimed atconcealing the objective reality. Hence, further anthropological eldwork is nec-essary in order to get a better grip on the working of the eld. Still, most artistswith whom we talked recognized our struggles. Of course, they are no innocentvictims but rather \"partners in crime\", which many of them realize and someopenly admitted. At the same time, it is striking that other players in the eld typ-ically dismissed the conflicts we had as incidents or called the credibility of ouraccount into question. Because I was actively involved in the project and not adistant academic observer, the present analysis too can easily be discarded as asubjective exaggeration. As a colleague from art history put it: \"Don't you thinkthat it was rst and foremost a concurrence of unfortunate circumstances andmatter of bad management?\" No, I do not. This may have been an extreme case.However, there is no doubt that the eld as a whole - that is, including academicsengaged in studying contemporary art - benets from minimizing the impor-tance of our case and similar \"incidents\". Moreover, if a thick description of aBalinese cock ght can help us to understand social relations in Balinese society,a close analysis of what happened to the Something's Brewing project may just as200 embedded in the dutch art worldwell serve as a rst step towards a better insight into the political economy of the contemporary art eld in the Netherlands.30 On her blog, Edith Abeyta summarized her experience with the art residency as follows: Now arts organizations and institutions no longer need artists, well, that's probably not exactly correct, they need the artist's C.V. and documentation ofthe artist's work to write their grant. But they don't need them to producework. It's such a hassle to work with artists, anyway, especially if they are stilloperating in the archaic realm of object making, this requires tools, materials,and a space to work, can't you all just give up these luxuries - any mediocre,temporary, solution will suffice as long as it is on camera. In response, Merry-Beth Noble, an American artist who contributed to Some- thing's Brewing, commented in equally pronounced terms: As artists, we must be aware that our images and creative products are fre-quently hijacked by unsavoury people and companies who use this work asa meal ticket, as prestige or as validation to receive money. The misuse of ourcreative product ranges from the labelling of warehouses as \"artist lofts\" or\"arts districts\" in real estate, to securing government grant money with pro-posals for mysterious non-existent events. This falsification at the artist'sexpense seems to becoming more and more common. Someone is makingmoney in all this madness, and it usually isn't the artist. These two comments, individually and taken together, raise a number of issues which go well beyond the individual case of our project. On the one hand, theycall our attention to the fact that the destabilization of the artist's position in theeld of restricted production is profoundly intertwined with the mediatizationand commercialization of social life. Media exposure - or more precisely theaccumulation of media capital - is a key factor to understanding the transforma-tion of the cultural eld and its political effects. Interdisciplinary research intothis process is much needed, whereby media scholars, cultural sociologists andart historians work together. On the other hand, however, contemporary art isbecoming so deeply contaminated with other models of consumption, as Noblepoints out, that we have to consider to what extent it remains theoretically fer-tile and historically justiable to differentiate between the eld of restricted pro-duction and the eld of large-scale cultural production. Hence, research into thecontemporary political economy of the artistic eld has to focus more on struc-tural homologies between the cultural eld and the economic eld. To considerthe question of power struggles in the eld of restricted production from the201 Judith Thissenaspect of media exposure , as both Abeyta and Noble do, is especially important in the light of rethinking the growing resentment against the contemporary artscene in the Netherlands. The devalorization of the artist and his/her workimplies a devalorization of the public. The arrogance towards the general public- as audiences and taxpayers - shows structural resemblances with the disguis-ing practices in the nancial world. The credit crunch of 2008-2009 was causedby bankers who repacked subprime mortgages into mortgage-backed securitiesto hide their subprime quality. When the virtual values turned out to be fake, thebanks started to collapse. What I propose then is to invigorate the Bourdieusantheoretical framework with a new set of economic concepts derived notablyfrom recent analyses of the burst of the real estate bubble, the credit crunch andthe subsequent market meltdown and bank crisis. Put differently, I suggest thatwe investigate the bubble economy in the cultural eld and its tendency towardsvirtual capitalization with the tools from economics. Within academia and the art world, there is much hesitancy to discuss the politi- cal economy of the not-for-prot segment of the cultural eld. In most settings,calling the disinterestedness of curators, advisors for public funding and otherintermediate gures between the artists and the public into question would be arisky venture. It suits almost all players, including the artists, not to ask ques-tions about decision-making and money-spending. The eld as a whole holds onto the disguising discourse of autonomy, which serves as \"opium for the artists\",who are indeed exploited by the mediators but also fail to organize themselvescollectively in order to systematically analyze the eld's capitalist logic anddevelop radical alternatives. Meanwhile, the ongoing commercialization ofsocial life, including the arts, seems to many academics in the humanities (espe-cially those on the left) such a self-evident object of social critique that they donot recognize the need to investigate these processes empirically and hence onlydiscuss them from a meta-theoretical perspective. For too long, the humanitieshave shown a disdain for economics and the material conditions under whichculture is produced. Obviously, the current political climate in the Netherlands isnot in favour of any research into this direction as the outcomes can be easilyused to serve the populist agenda. And yet, we do have to address the hiddenpolitical economy of the cultural eld, especially if we want to provide an answerto the populist resentment against Art. 202 embedded in the dutch art worldNotes 1. \"De tentoonstelling loopt liefhebbers het museum.\" Newsletter regarding Kees 2010-2011 at the Boijmans van Beuningen, http://boijmans.nl/nl/116/nieuwsbrief/ newsletteritem/469, accessed 14 May 2011.

The project was funded by a \u00a442,000 grant from NWO and partner sponsors. We spent \u00a440,338. In each case the grant included a fixed \u00a411,000 honorarium for the artist. This was quite an exceptional situation because in the Netherlands artists are rarely paid for their con-tribution to projects or exhibitions. The same sum was paid to the university to cover thecosts of the teaching replacement for the scholar. We spent the material budget ( \u00a420,000) primarily on brewing equipment, arts materials, travel expenses and a little catalogue, whichwe published ourselves via Lulu. Because of the project's do-it-yourself approach, the cost ofexternal advisors and services amounted to less than 10% of our material budget or 4.5% ofthe total budget.

Judith ThissenChapter Fifteen Roots and the Production of Heritage Alex van Stipriaan When in 1978 African American journalist Alex Haley published his historical quest Roots, it was an almost instant success.1The book sold by the millions and its immensely popular adaption for television conquered the world. In theNetherlands, for instance, the series was broadcasted several times and is stillavailable on DVD. Haley had done what so many in the African Diasporawanted: nd the route back to where their ancestors came from before theirenslavement in West- and Central Africa. He used stories and archives and allkinds of other tangible and intangible cultural heritage to nd his way back tothe Mandinka family of royal blood in Gambia that he eventually dug up to behis forefathers. For a long time, the concept of \"roots\" was almost synonymouswith African roots. Eventually, however, two parallel discourses on roots emerged: on the one hand, an academic discourse with political implications, closely linked to issuesof globalization, diaspora and identity, and, on the other hand, a more populardiscourse focused on authenticity and belonging. In the eld of cultural studies, in particular, the concept of roots fell on fertile academic ground. From the 1990s onwards, scholars - including Paul Gilroy,Stuart Hall, and James Clifford, to mention some of the most prominent namesin this eld - have worked on the interplay of roots and diaspora. 2They made it part of their discourse on cultural identity and paired \"roots\" with \"routes\". Intheir view, cultural identities, especially diasporic cultural identities, are a con-tinuous dialogue between roots, which is a state of being tied to a specic place,and routes, which is a state of displacement. Put differently, cultural identities are not only rmly rooted in histories, language and culture of a particular place(who we are; where we come from), but also, and perhaps even more so, part ofa process of becoming. 3In some of these postmodern from-roots-to-routes approaches, uprootedness seems almost celebrated. Clearly, this attitude reflects206an era in which ongoing processes of globalization intensied, leading to lively debates about the position and importance of the hybrid, the Creole, and m\u00e9tis- sage, as might be observed, for instance, of the works of Homi Bhabha, Ulf Han-nerz and Nikos Papastergiadis. By sharp contrast, the popular and cultural activist discourse is dominated by voices that favour the security of roots over the insecurity of routes. This goes for all kinds of fundamentalist approaches by people who seek to return to or hangon to a supposedly authentic and pure cultural, ideological or even ethnic core.In contemporary multicultural popular discourse there is little room for ques-tioning the importance of roots. Roots should be fostered or re-appropriated.They are even used as a new kind of cultural essentialism in identity politics. Thehotly debated institutional integration of migrant communities into mainstreamsociety is often phrased in terms of essential cultural qualities that are seen asindivisible and unchangeable and hence need to be maintained and treasured.Not only migrants and their descendants lay claim to cultural authenticity; dom-inant social groups do this too. At the same time, precisely as a consequence of intensied globalization, the concept of roots as a heritage has widely transgressed its African connotation.Ever more people refer to roots as a proof of authenticity. It seems to offer us aguarantee that we deal with the \"real\" thing, the \"original\". In this context,roots can refer to particular geographical, ethnic, ideological or religious con-texts as well as specic segments of cultural traditions - invented or not. Aprominent example is roots music, which is closely associated with \"worldmusic\". But roots can be applied to a wide range of cultural expressions, rangingfrom fashion to design, painting to culinary practices. Meanwhile, Haley's research methods to nd his African roots has come under severe re from historians. 4Apart from accusations of fraud and plagia- rism, a more substantial critique points to the fact that attempts by other AfricanAmericans to track down their ancestors across the ocean and learn about theirparticular roots all failed. Throughout the history of slavery, traders had soughthard to wipe out any African traces by imposing upon their slaves a new identity,once they had survived the anonymous and degrading transatlantic crossing.Thus, Afro-Americans in search of their own past run up against completelyEurocentric historical records and have to deal with an almost physical abyss ofanonymity that seems to have swallowed their ancestors. In the aftermath of the success of Roots, some of my Afro friends asked me to trace their history. Typically, I failed to provide detailed responses. SometimesI was able to trace part of their family history back into the eighteenth century. Icould tell them on which plantations their ancestors had lived, for instance. Inother cases, I could sketch in broad lines from which parts of West or CentralAfrica their ancestors had come, but that was all I could do. With the turn of the207 Alex van Stipriaannew century, however, a new research tool became available, opening up new ways to dig into the past of transatlantic slavery: DNA analysis. Roots and DNA Nowadays we have a new, yet very old type of cultural heritage at our disposal,which might even be considered the most globalized form of cultural heritage. Itcan be found in the most universal, yet most personal kind of archive or museumthere is: the human body. It is the storehouse for loads of hereditary materialholding information going back millennia. It is also where the physical and men-tal memories that we need instantly are stocked. This heritage, however, is noteasily accessible. The larger part of its historical content can only be decipheredby means of DNA analysis of genetic material, the tangible part of the humanbody. The intangible part remains still safely stored in our brains and can not bestudied yet without our own personal translation. DNA can be used to understand the evolution of modern humans, trace migration patterns, differentiate and identify individuals, and determine the ori-gins of domestic plants and animals. As one scholar put it, DNA analysis is \"thegreatest archaeological excavation of all time\". 5From the late 1990s onwards, it rapidly developed into an instrument for tracking down individual lineages andhistories. Not surprisingly, African Americans in the United States were amongthe rst to regard DNA analysis as an exciting new tool for bridging the gap withAfrica. Within a few years scientists made the technology available to the publicat large, increasingly so on a commercial basis. Claims that DNA analysis couldlink a person of African descent to his or her ethnic group of origin in Africa pro-vided a strong incentive for this new product. It suddenly became possible forpeople who are part of the African diaspora to ll in a hitherto largely blankpage of their individual past, rendering it much more concrete by learning aboutthe culture of their ancestors, perhaps even visit the region of origin. It waswidely believed that DNA technology would eventually make it possible touncover everyone's roots. At least, that was everyone's hope, which we sharedwhen we started the art-science project Back to the Roots in 2006. Back to the Roots Our project started from a simple question: what exactly are roots and what dothey look like? To nd out, we put together a mixed group of established artistsand young talent of Afro-Caribbean background. All of them live and work inthe Netherlands. Actress and comedian Jetty Mathurin (b. 1951) and visualartist Marcel Pinas (b. 1971) were both born in Suriname. At the start of theproject, they already had a signicant history of their own and hence perhaps a208 roots and the production of heritagemore substantial notion of what (their) roots were like than the younger artists in the group. Kwinsie had already left the basic amateur statusbehind in their respective artistic elds, but none of them had a very specicsense of their further career yet. Most of them were still busy with their educa-tion. Their primary frame of reference was urban popular culture rather than theestablished art world and they had little attachment to xed jargon or conven-tions. Although because of their age they did not have much of a past yet, theyhad a lot of future and a fresh and open mind. Everyone in the group had very personal motives to search for their roots. Marcel dearly wanted to know about his past to understand \"certain things\" aswell as his position in the present. Along similar lines, Jetty added that sheneeded this also \"to justify my right to be here\", meaning in the Netherlands.Stacey, who is born in the Netherlands, stated that her roots quest started the dayshe got a black Barbie doll for her birthday. This made her realize \"that althoughI lived in the Netherlands I was also a black person living in the Netherlands\".For Herby the roots trip was almost something of a sacred obligation: I have always said that once in my life I have to go to Africa. It is like Muslims who once in their life go to Mecca and when they return they're supposed to becleansed and pure. So when I got the chance to go to the country of my roots ...I really feel that when I'll return [to the Netherlands] I'll have made my journeyto Mecca. I'll be complete. The idea was that everyone was going to search for their roots in as many as pos- sible different ways. So part of the personal quest was based on interviews withfamily members, genealogical research, the study of literature and archivalsources, as well as a process of introspection. The other part was tracing ancestryvia DNA. Right from the start, we decided that some participants would pursuetheir DNA track by going to Africa, while others would not. This set-up wouldallow us to compare the differences in perceptions between a lived experience ofa hitherto unknown country of origin and knowledge of one's roots that wasexclusively based on images and descriptions. From the start, the question if people actually have roots or whether they merely construct them - an issue that receives surprisingly little attention - was a central concern of the project. Constructing roots In the period before the results of the rst DNA tests came in, all participantstalked about their hunches and feelings about the possible outcome. Stacey andGwen expressed a more general belief when stating that they actually knew that209 Alex van Stipriaantheir ancestors came from the region of present-day Ghana. Most participants had images in mind of martial and colourful people with a long history, such asthe Ashanti. We also discussed the concept of \"home\" in relation to \"roots\". ToVerno, born in the rural town of Hoogeveen in the north of the Netherlands, ithad always been an enigma whether he and his younger brother were actually\"Antillean Dutch or Dutch Antilleans\". \"To this day I still don't know,\" he said,\"but I always felt at ease Kwinsie added: \"I feel Suri-namese and Amsterdammer. You can tell from the colour of my skin that I'm notof Dutch origin, but I'm an Amsterdammer at heart. There have been instancesthat I was told to 'piss off to my own country,' you know, but where do I go?\"Yet Kwinsie also called himself \"Surinamese\" and as a musician he played tradi-tional Surinamese - or what others would describe as roots music. When theproject started, he had never been to Suriname. Shortly afterwards, he visited thecountry of his parents for the rst time and this led him to reconsider his positionin Dutch society: maybe he was an Amsterdammer at heart, but Suriname feltlike home. When we nally received the DNA results, an intricate process started in which we gradually discovered that every step on the roots trail involved makingdecisions about the next step (sometimes even literally). This began when we hadto choose a DNA rm. We decided for African Ancestry, a company that claimsto have the largest African DNA database. Immediately after that, we had todecide if we would take the maternal or the paternal test. We decided to do thetests in the ancestral mother line as it better reflected the matrilinear and matrifo-cal character of Afro-Caribbean culture. Without knowing, quite a number ofchoices were made for us. Once we began to pose questions, they were rarelyanswered. For example, we wondered: How representative are the DNA samplesfor all these hundreds of ethnic groups in West- and Central Africa? (It's hard tosay yet.) Did the ethnic groups whose DNA material is gathered for the databasealways reside in the same regions? (No, they moved.) Are all these samples gath-ered in a way in which the integrity of the donors is guaranteed? (Possibly not.)How many generations do the laboratories go back with their DNA research?(Probably ten to twelve generations, but some enslaved ancestors came muchearlier or later to the Americas.) The maternal DNA tests pointed to a relatively large number of different eth- nic groups in a smaller number of West African regions. Not one of the partici-pants was linked to Ghana or the Congo-Angola area, although we know fromarchival research that almost two-fths of the enslaved ancestors in the Dutchcolonies came from this part of Africa. Some participants were linked to coun-tries that did not stir enthusiasm, like Sierra Leone and Liberia, with their bloodycivil wars still fresh on the mind. Others were linked to a number of different eth-nic groups, which complicated the quest for clear roots. This became even much210 roots and the production of heritagemore evident, when the participants also took the paternal test. The second series of tests linked them to many other ethnic groups in other regions, thuscomplicating things even further. When it came out that one third of the paternalDNA traces ended up in Europe, implicating a white forefather, questions aboutwhat roots were and are now became even more pressing. If you are looking forAfrican roots, do you accept Europe as roots too? Two group members refusedthis. One of them explained: \"I don't want to be a descendant of a rapist.\" Par-ticipants also discovered that in some cases where they knew about non-Africanancestors, these ancestors were not brought to light by the DNA tests. We thenstarted to realize that only the direct line of mothers and fathers are traced, leav-ing out a very large group of ancestors to whom each individual is also bio-genet-ically linked (e.g. the test only retains one pair of grandparents). So, choosing thedirect mother line is a cultural choice or an emotional one, and perhaps very con-venient because it leaves out white ancestors but it remains a choice and it isbiased in any case. Cameroon was selected as the destination of the eld trip because the mater- nal DNA prole of three participants linked them to ethnic groups who live there(see gure 24). During this visit, we found out that roots can choose to turn youdown. Contrary to the warm welcome we experienced in a village of theBamileke people to whom Gwen is related, the Fulani village where we went todiscover more about Herby's roots kept their distance. While looking around,Herby observed that most villagers differed from him: \"[They are] more likeSomali with smooth hair and a lighter skin. My hair is frizzy and my skin isdark.\" Despite these differences, he introduced himself to the village elder as \"aboy from Holland who has only recently discovered his roots and now has thechance to visit my Fulani people\". A profound silence followed. Apparently,Herby's statement struck them as rather odd because he was not a Muslim likethem. They asked him if he wanted to convert to Islam. In other words, he waswelcome, but not more than just a little bit. This was also how Herby felt. With-out turning down their request of converting to Islam, he made it clear that thisquestion was quite difcult for him to deal with at all. Herby's confused feelingsfurther increased when we walked through the village, discovering people wholooked more like Herby himself. We all got the impression that the lighterskinned Fulani were much better off than the darker skinned Fulani, who seemedto be poorer and doing the most unpleasant jobs. The distribution of power andwealth in the village reminded us in a very poignant way of the history of internalAfrican slavery. It also called our attention to the enormous social inequality andethnic discrimination within present-day Africa. This past and present can alsobe part of one's roots. Herby decided not to spend the night in the village and wemoved on.211 Alex van StipriaanRoots and emancipation When our quest for roots was over, each participant was asked to formulate his or her idea of roots in an artistic way (see gure 25).6Jetty Mathurin produced a one-woman theatre show about her quest for roots, combining humour and seri-ous reflections. During the show, she explains how the Back to the Roots project has made her become serene, after a life in which she was always mad at every-thing and everyone in respect to the past. \"It is not necessary anymore. Enough isenough. I now determine on my own what I want to take along ... and what Iwant to let go.\" This statement of emancipation from a historical burden alsoresonated in Stacey's poetic performance To My Mothers. After addressing allher foremothers one by one, meanwhile pulling off skirt after skirt, she ends bysaying: \"[T]his daughter has returned because she is free ... I will not call themslaves no more, they were my mothers before.\" And Gwen Denswil, who pro-duced a puppet play of a white boy and a black girl, hilariously discussing familyorigins, concluded after her performance: \"I'm at peace with the Cameroonresult; I've done my research, my quest is over now\", which obviously has anemancipatory ring to it too. For Marcel Pinas, roots were the things that showed a clear bond between Africa and Suriname, in particular with the most African ethnic group in Suri-name, the Maroons, to which he and his family belong. Roots for Marcel alsoexpressed feelings of nostalgia for a disappearing or threatened past. He made aninstallation of the most globalized type of plastic bag in which he placed videosshowing Cameroon women carrying all kinds of goods on their heads (see gure26). These images took him back to his childhood in the interior of Suriname.Although referring to a (nostalgic) past, the installation underlines at the sametime that Marcel's roots are part of his present-day luggage. \"Africa hasstrengthened me as an artist\", he explained. The rap lyrics by Verno Romneyreveal a similar trajectory. They show his newfound strength by combining theseriousness of a roots quest with the fun of its results: Because I'm black you would say my family couldn't be white / all my searches changed my view, it changed my insight / .... / A German sailor, captain WillieBraun, visited the isle of Statia's vibrant town / he found love, on a night of fun /hence the Caribbean Brown's of Goedhard and Kwinsie Cruden took this stance one step further by presenting their roots feelings as the ultimate mix of past andpresent, there and here. Musicians Herby and Kwinsie put together an ensemblethat performed an Afro-Surinamese winti-song accompanied by African percus-sion \"for the right rhythm\" and a European electric bass, because, as Herby212 roots and the production of heritageexplained: \"thus I know how to strike the right note when singing\". Charissa expressed her roots in a performance that combined all the dance traditions,including the accompanying dresses of those cultures, she could trace among herancestors: Native American, Asian and African, all held together in a contempo-rary (global) dance frame. \"Because I'm a hotchpotch myself, this suits me per-fectly\", she said, concluding with her roots motto as the ultimate form of presen-tism: \"Create your own heart beat.\" Reflecting on the impact of the Back to the Roots for the younger generation, Jetty Mathurin made the following observation. \"I was born in a still colonialSuriname, I carry that history with me.\" Marcel still lives in Suriname and car-ries the recent history of civil war in Suriname too. \"But the youngsters in thegroup,\" Jetty explained, \"do not know that Suriname. This project has empow-ered their being black in the Netherlands, that is where their true home is. Nowthey can say: my history might be different from yours, and I might look differ-ent from you, but here is where I belong, whatever is said to the contrary.\" Despite the revolutionary techniques of DNA analysis, the personal and col- lective experiences of the Back to the Roots project highlight that roots remain very much in the domain of the cultural and the social. They are emotionallypowered, subjective products of selections made in one's personal history as wellas in the history of the groups one identies with. Roots are \"works-in-progress\", a continuing process of self-expression, self-reflection, and collectivesearches for connectedness. In many respects, then, roots are quite the oppositeof cultural essentialism and its associated fundamentalism. Notes 1. Alex Haley, Roots (Garden City: Doubleday, 1976). 2.

As the name of the project suggests, its aim was to investigate observatories,places where astronomers observe heavenly bodies. We were the artist andscholar involved. Jeroen Werner came to the project because of his previous art-work, which consists of optical installations creating spaces of light beams andimage projections that explore the geometry of seeing. Geert Somsen wasinvolved as a historian of science interested in the shifting cultural meanings andsocial functions of observational practices. These intersecting interests werebrought together in a common workplace: the nineteenth-century observatory\"De Sonnenborgh\" in Utrecht, whose scientic staff more or less acted as a thirdparty in the project. 1 Although we had a common interest, the project was very open-ended, exploring not only our subject matter, but also what it meant for an artist andhistorian of science to cooperate. Even as our activities became more concrete,these aspects continued to be exploratory. But despite this tentative character, itwas often said that The Observatory Observed was \"successful\" as a project, both while it was still going on and afterwards. Such appreciation was nice, ofcourse, and it did reflect our own pleasure in working together. But at the sametime it was never really spelled out what the alleged success consisted of. Now,more than two years later, it seems like a good moment to look back and reflecton this issue. What was successful about our project? What was not? And more generally: what does \"success\" mean in art-science collaborations? In thesepages, we will answer these questions for ourselves, and also consider what theymight have meant for others.214Scholarly success What drew both of us to this cooperation and what we shared from the begin- ning was an interest in observatories as special kinds of places. For JeroenWerner the fascination was mainly with the geometry of their architecture andoptical installations that reflect lines of seeing and the orientation of the earth inthe universe (more about this below). For Geert Somsen, the attraction lay in thecombination of locality and universality in observatories. On the one hand, theyare very particular - even peculiar - kinds of places. On the other hand, they pro-duce observations of the universe which should be valid anywhere and generallytrue. On the one hand, they exist and have existed in virtually every human civi-lization - from Peru to Korea, and from prehistory to the space age. 2On the other hand, they clearly bear the stamps of the specic cultures that broughtthem forth. This cultural ubiquity makes observatories especially suited forexploring what a global history of science might look like. The historiography ofscience has long limited itself to Europe as the place where the key developments(such as the Scientic Revolution) took place, leaving non-European science as amarginal and separate eld. It is only recently that scholars have been trying tointegrate the two. 3But such an integration immediately raises questions. Should one focus on the contributions which every civilization has made to a universalstock of knowledge? 4Or should one treat science as geographically and cultur- ally diverse? It is these issues that the study of observatories - being ubiquitousanddiverse, local and universal - can bring out very well. What we decided to do in our project was rst to simply look at observatories of different times and places. After considering the nineteenth-century Sonnen-borgh observatory in Utrecht (see below), we took off to compare it to others -rst the cutting-edge radio telescope Lofar in the north of the Netherlands, andthen a fteenth-century observatory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and two eigh-teenth-century Jantar Mantars in Rajasthan, India. We ended up visiting totalof seven observatories, including the mid-twentieth-century Dutch installationsin Dwingeloo and Westerbork. Comparing these observatories, it was impossible not to be struck by the enormous variety in the ways they were set up (see gures 27-30). While the Son-nenborgh installations have the familiar shape of a rotating dome through whichtelescopes peek, Lofar consists of countless spider-like antennas, strewn out overfarm elds. And while the Samarkand observatory is a gigantic stone quadrantsunk into the earth, its Indian counterparts, look, if anything, like skateboardparks, full of half-pipes and curved ramps. The question arose what this varietystemmed from. For what aims and functions had each of these observatoriesbeen designed? It quickly turned out that these questions had rarely been asked,let alone answered. 5The typical approach has been to take the ubiquity of obser-215 Geert Somsen and Jeroen Wernervatories as an expression of mankind's universal quest for knowledge.6From that point of view they have been mainly assessed for their \"contributions\" to the development of astronomy: new measurements of star positions, stepstowards a heliocentric world-picture, etc. But such a perspective in effect relatesthem to developments that came later, and divorces them from the worlds inwhich they were built and functioned. That the Uzbek observations come closeto current standards of accuracy tells us nothing about why they were made inthe rst place. Hence the intentions of the original builders of the observatoriesremained in the dark. In order to shed more light on these origins we needed to expand our research. It was impossible for us to extensively scrutinize primary sources (especially inUzbekistan and India) for several reasons, but we did talk to local experts andtrace literature produced by historians there. We conducted interviews with thecurrent directors of the observatories in Samarkand and Jaipur, and they and aDelhi historian of science led us to more relevant publications. This quest led to fascinating answers. We learned, for example, that the giant quadrant in Samarkand was the prestige object of a new ruling dynasty. Itsfounder, Ulugh Beg, was the grandson of the infamous Amir Timur, who con-quered huge swaths of Central Asia and Persia in the ruthless style of his forefa-ther Genghis Khan. Now the Timurids did not only want to be known as fear-some conquerors, but also as good Muslims, and one of the duties of devoutrulers was to add to the stock of knowledge. 7Hence Ulugh Beg established a madrassa devoted to mathematics, built the most accurate quadrant ever madeand created a new star catalogue that surpassed anything since Ptolemy. 8After this, the observatory was abandoned until it was excavated by a Russian archae-ologist. 9Only the underground part remains. We also found that the \"skateboard parks\" in Rajasthan were at least partly built for astrological purposes. Most of their devices work like sundials, and theirfounder, Maharajah Jai Singh II, spent as much money on them as on his manysumptuous palaces. 10But for all his investments, the instruments were not very accurate. Partly this may have been because they were meant for public display -much like the lavishly decorated planetariums of wealthy contemporary Euro-peans. Another function seems to have been the drawing up of horoscopes, a prac-tice still carried out today. In fact, a Brahmin priest oversees the annual publica-tion of an almanac using readings from the Jantar Mantar instruments in Jaipur,some of which are specically oriented towards the signs of the zodiac. 11This may sound exotic and unscientic, but it is actually not that unusual. Astrology haslong been important for Western astronomers as well, and improving predictionshas been a major stimulus for astronomical work in early modern Europe. The observation of observatories abroad also led to new questions about observatories at home. What had they been built for? Was it merely the advance-216 how to succeed in art and sciencement of astronomy or also for prestige and utility of some form? Sonnenborgh's meteorological and meridian devices certainly point in the latter direction. Son-nenborgh was built for astronomy, but no less to produce weather reports and toaid the nineteenth-century Dutch merchant fleet by providing time settings andnavigational standards. 12Similarly for Lofar, its enormous network of detectors around a supercomputer is not only used to probe the universe, but also to takeseismic measurements and to provide accurate soil data for so-called precisionagriculture. Through these functions the Lofar scientists hope to achieve thekind of valorization that is necessary for large scientic enterprises in the earlytwenty-rst century. 13 It seems then that every observatory we visited had been built in response to the demands and aspirations of its own time and place - reflecting its local cul-ture rather than transcending it. That feature makes it difcult to t all of theminto a single story of the advancement of astronomy. If we follow the universalmodel and only look at the \"contributions\" each has made to astronomicalknowledge, we would miss all the local variety and reduce a richly varied pictureto a much impoverished storyline - all the above motivations and non-astro-nomical uses, for example, would be irrelevant to that tale. Moreover, we woulddistort the historical picture by basically using presentist and Eurocentric stan-dards. For what counts as a \"contribution\" is in effect determined by the current state of our astronomy - if an astronomer in the past embraced heliocentrism it would be counted in, if he improved astrology it would be counted out. What isnot a step in our direction is completely lost from view. And so the universalmodel of contributions from everywhere sounds inclusive, but in fact it is reduc-tive and exclusionary. 14 This has been a major outcome of our project. Included in it is the suggestion of what an alternative global history of science might look like: as a multifacetedpicture of geographically diverse developments - not a single, progressive story,but a variety of endeavours, with every culture producing its own kind of knowl-edge for its own needs and purposes. In several ways such an account wouldresemble the history of art. It is true that art history has also had its reductive his-toriographies, which, e.g. viewed every development as a step towards increas-ing pictorial abstraction. But few would reduce non-Western art to that story-line, or ask why Chinese painters never made it to neoclassicism. Art is easilyseen as culturally diverse - or at least a lot more easily than science where thisview has trouble breaking through. The Observatory Observed has helped a lot to move in that direction, and in that sense the project has been successful forGeert Somsen. The shape of a global history of science has denitely becomeclearer.217 Geert Somsen and Jeroen WernerSuccess in art As an artist, Jeroen Werner had his own motivations for being interested in the specic characteristics of observatories. His art consists of investigating and cre-ating optical installations, in which geometries of light beams work across spaceto create wonderful patterns and projections (see gures 31-33). For example,his Reprocilinder (2001 and 2005) projects a viewer's body to a 3D image else- where in the room, with laser beams indicating the optical lines. And his Zoom- mirror (1997), a reflective inflatable membrane with variable focus length, blows up and shrinks a projected image by becoming successively concave and convex.The observatories in particular drew Jeroen Werner's attention by the geometryof the different sightlines embodied in their architecture. At Sonnenborgh, thesewere partly determined by the sixteenth-century fortication that was used asthe foundation to the observatory. Its function to spot enemies and direct gunsalong the city walls already imposed an optical geometry. When the telescopeswere installed in the observatory on top of the fortress, new sightlines wereadded to this pattern: towards the sky, towards the north, and in parallel to theearth's axis. 15In Delhi and Jaipur, the architecture itself was the instrument, since the installations, often several stories high and including inner rooms, weregraduated arcs, directed towards the sun, moon, or zodiac constellations. AtSamarkand, the quadrant was built to face a tiny pinhole that projected sharpimages of heavenly bodies onto the dial, like a camera obscura. A similar, but smaller and newer instrument, was demonstrated to us in Jaipur. All these observations led Jeroen Werner to make numerous sketches and models for possible observatories, some of which were shown at exhibitions atSonnenborgh and in Scheltema, a centre for contemporary art belonging toMuseum De Lakenhal in Leiden. Some of the designs, titled Obstupas, fused tel- escopic domes with Indian stupas, equally symmetrical buildings for esoteric,rather than external, observation. At Scheltema, Jeroen also installed a lasertable, which allowed visitors to explore the use of sightlines by playing with laserbeams, architectural plans and transparent objects - a work in progress ratherthan a nished work of art (see gure 33). This installation reflected what we hadseen at Sonnenborgh, but in many ways predated our observations of very simi-lar sightline patterns in Uzbekistan and India. The project also had different effects. It allowed Jeroen Werner to work within Sonnenborgh and to connect his own constructions to those of the obser-vatory. From the very beginning of the project, it had been our explicit aim tointegrate his work as much as possible into the observatory spaces, and to seam-lessly melt astronomical with artistic research. A rst chance for doing this pre-sented itself during a lunar eclipse. For this event, Jeroen combined a set ofZoom-mirrors, which he had previously made, with existing observational218 how to succeed in art and scienceinstruments so as to create new viewing devices. This spectacle, called Moon- zoom, was repeated, in slightly different forms, during the Dutch National Museum weekend as Zonzoom (Dutch for \"sun zoom\"), and at an \"art & sci- ence party\" called Discovery 07, in front of hundreds of people in a big venue inAmsterdam (see gure 31). These performances gave rise to a number of new ideas. As a sideshow at Moonzoom, we had projected the full moon's image using the large sun telescopeonto a small white ball in a dark room in the heart of the observatory (see gure32). This created a sensation of a three-dimensional miniature moon hanging inspace and shining by actual moonlight. After seeing this, Jeroen Werner designeda \"True Moon Projector\" that could do the same thing by being mounted onto asmall telescope - a gadget that might be interesting to amateur astronomers, orso Sonnenborgh's staff said. Also, working with a large solar spectrum projectorinspired him to create a milk glass disk in the shape of a painter's palette, thatcould hold the projector's spectral colours. During Zonzoom we used this as a demonstration instrument for explaining astrophysics to curious visitors. These products and performances were enthusiastically received. The staff at Sonnenborgh and the organizers of Discovery 07 were very happy with the artis-tic contributions. Moreover, they led Jeroen to work with some of the observa-tory's technical experts. This collaboration made clear how closely related hisand their skills really were. Although their aims were different, Jeroen's and thetechnicians' expertise in operating optical machinery were very similar. This notonly made for pleasant cooperation, but also demonstrated the skilful nature ofscientic practice. But there was also a drawback. Successful as his contributions may have been in the eyes of others, Jeroen Werner felt somewhat limited by their nature. Afterall, each of these projects was work on commission, but none of the commission-ers was interested in his art per se. Both at Sonnenborgh and during Discovery07, art was part of a larger manifestation with other than artistic goals. On theone hand, it was interesting to be part of such great mixed undertakings. On theother hand, they limited what could be done. The only venues where JeroenWerner could present the outcomes of his own research, independently, was theinterim exhibition at Sonnenborgh and the show at Scheltema. A nal exhibitwhere he could show his end results in a bigger space, was cancelled from theCO-OPs programme. This meant that the only nished work he was able to dis-play, was that which was made within other settings (and not easily adaptablefor museum display), not the nal outcomes of his own artistic explorations.Success, therefore, was partial. 16219 Geert Somsen and Jeroen WernerSuccess in science This brings us to the last consideration of the \"success\" of our project: its suc- cessfulness in the eyes of the people surrounding it. Why were they so enthusias-tic? In order to answer this question, it is important to realize the institutionalsettings in which we operated. One of these was Sonnenborgh. Now Sonnen-borgh is an observatory, but its days as a place for cutting-edge astronomicalresearch lie in the past. Today it is a museum, a meeting point for amateurastronomers and an institute for science popularization. And so it should comeas no surprise that it is for these functions that Jeroen Werner's artistic contribu-tions were valued. His art was used to enliven demonstrations of astronomy,both during the lunar eclipse night and the national museum weekend. And hisdesigns of astronomical devices were welcomed for amateur and educationalpurposes. For Sonnenborgh, CO-OPs was a contribution to its science popular-izing mission. Similar things can be said about Discovery 07. The purpose of this party was to make science hip and attractive to a young audience. Main sponsors of theevent were the Netherlands Organisation for Scientic Research (NWO), theRoyal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, and a government agency for stimulat-ing young people to study science and technology. The means to this end werethe combination of science with DJ party culture and artistic performances. Butit was not the latter that needed to be sold. Science was the product, art was partof its attractive packaging. But then perhaps the same is true, to some extent, for the role of the NWO in the CO-OPs programme. It is unique and unprecedented that a Dutch sciencefunding organization provides support for artistic research, and NWO certainlydeserves praise for this move. But what may have been an extra motivation isthat such cooperation might present science in an attractive light. NWO not onlyfunds scientic research, but also regularly defends its spending before an oftenvery cost-conscious government. And this is not always easy. Of course, one candefend funding research by pointing to its economic spin-offs, but apart fromthat a lot of science is hard to sell, since it is highly specialized and not easilyaccessible. Science journalists often point out how badly scientists themselves\"market\" their own business. Associating science with art, however, can make itlook fascinating, exciting and much more presentable. 17Perhaps partly for that reason, CO-OPs participants were stimulated to show their work at public man-ifestations. In The Observatory Observed, we did this on many occasions, and these public moments drew large audiences and a lot of media attention. It is per-haps also for this reason that our project was deemed successful.220 how to succeed in art and scienceConclusion Success comes in many flavours, depending on aims and expectations. Our own aims with the observation of observatories were to explore new vistas in the his-toriography of science and to inspire new avenues in optical art. On these pointswe have been partially successful - at least according to our own estimates. Butthere have also been external aims and expectations, which only gradually, andperhaps only partially, became clear to us. It was mostly on the basis of theseexpectations that our project has been declared successful, even if they were notnecessarily ours. This is nothing to complain about. Just as the appreciation of anovel is in the hands of its public, not its author, our work is to be judged by oth-ers. But it is interesting to see that the success of an art-science cooperation canbe constituted from outside the cooperation itself. Notes 1. For an overview of the project, see G.J. Somsen and J.

This view is common in much popular historiography, but it also underlay the first serious attempts at a global history of science in the mid-twentieth century, e.g. by George Sartonand Joseph Needham. For Sarton, science was the only endeavour that tied all of humankindtogether, precisely because it transcended culture and nationality. Needham came to simi-lar conclusions in his extensive studies of Chinese science. See G. Sarton, \"l'Histoire de lascience 312-317. 5. Functions like calendar-making areoften mentioned, but most studies quickly turn from the why to the how, and concentrate on the technical aspects of celestial observation. Interest-ingly, this problem was also experienced by the author of a book of the Indian observatories,Virendra Nath Sharma: \"The question, why someone would build instruments of masonryand stone in the age of the telescope, intrigued me. I found no convincing answers in the existing literature\" (Virendra Nath Sharma, Banarsidass Publishers 1995], vii). But the research Sharma carried out himself to fill thatlacuna, although producing many insights into the details and contexts of the Jantar Man-tars, in the end still does not answer that main question. It is only recently that historians of221 Geert Somsen and Jeroen Wernerscience have begun to explicitly address the various uses of observatories in the societies that they were part of. The most important publication is a study of their role in adminis- trative, navigational, commercial and military practices, as well as entertainment in nine-teenth-century Europe: David Aubin, Charlotte Bigg and Otto Sibum, eds.

See, e.g. the recent BBC series History of Science: The Story of Our Thirst for Knowledge - Part I: What Is Out There? (2010). In a recent study, the sociologist Toby Huff takes a comparable approach, taking \"intellectual curiosity\" as a universal condition for doing science, and assessing the extent to which the scientists of various civilizations have met that criterion.Toby E.

It was satisfying, however, to see some of his experiments with sightlines that led to the222 how to succeed in art and sciencework-in-progress shown at Scheltema more or less confirmed in the Indian and Uzbek ob- servatories. There we were able to stand inside geometries that Jeroen Werner had alreadyenvisioned before. Things seemed to come full circle, and the experience led to further spec-ulations about the observatories' uses. 17. Of course, the opposite is also true, but that is not the concern of the NWO.223 Geert Somsen and Jeroen WernerPartviI Looking Back, Looking ForwardIntroduction In 2002, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) launched a large-scale research programme to explore recent transformations in the cul-tural field and develop new theoretical concepts and frameworks for the human-ities. Transformations in Arts and Culture ran for almost a decade and consisted of seven sub-programmes involving over 30 senior and junior scholars at differ-ent universities in the Netherlands. In addition, an art-science programme CO-OPs was set up in which artists and academics explored how art and acad- eme could mutually benefit from each other's practices and ideas. The focus of the Transformations programme was on three interlinked processes that have profoundly reshaped the field of art and culture during thepast decades: globalization, commercialization and technologization. The aimwas to research how these processes have manifested themselves over time(diachronically), through space (synchronically), and in various media. Whatnew modes of communication, interaction and community building haveemerged since the digital revolution? How do new manifestations of art and cul-ture give meaning to our existence? What tools and concepts do we need to bet-ter understand processes of social and cultural change? How can existing disci-plines within the humanities enrich and strengthen each other by workingtogether in interdisciplinary projects? These questions were at the heart of theprogramme. Ten years later, the central issues of the Transformations in Art and Culture programme have been further elaborated and the research of the participants hasmaterialized not only in the present volume but in numerous monographs, Ph.D.dissertations, edited volumes, and articles, as well as in exhibitions and art proj-ects. At this point, Jos\u00e9 van Dijck and Robert Zwijnenberg, two members of thepreparatory committee that designed the Transformations programme on behalf of the NWO, were invited to look back and discuss its impact on arts andhumanities research. Taking their initial ideals and the actual output as steppingstones, they assess the programme's achievements but also look forward toaddress the relevance of the humanities today and in the near future.227Interview with Jos\u00e9 van Dijck and Robert Zwijnenberg By Marcel ten Hooven I Instead of carrying a photograph of his wife Patricia in his wallet, the Canadian neurophilosopher Paul Churchland has a scan of her brain. As passionate advo-cates of eliminative materialism, the couple view psychological phenomena suchas belief, hope and love as constructions of the imagination. It is their contentionthat, in essence, the brain comprises merely the interaction between the neuronscontained therein. Believing in a human mind is the same as believing that theearth is flat. The irony is that this act of holding on to a scan, intended to tease romantics, can also be viewed as an ultra-romantic expression of love. At least that is theopinion of Jos\u00e9 van Dijck and Robert Zwijnenberg. \"Churchland says that thebrain scan shows more of his wife than a photograph. In this way he romanticizesthe brain scan ...\", says Zwijnenberg. Van Dijck responds: course, Magic patient Hans Castorp inspects the X-ray of hisfellow patient, with whom he is in love. This image transports him to a pink cloudof love because he can see inside her. He keeps the X-ray for years in his wallet.Churchland's story is exactly the same.\" Zwijnenberg: \"I'm impressed with howMann is able to eroticize an X-ray. For Castorp it is an erotic experience to see in-side his beloved's ribcage. The image is not only a medical or technological prod-uct but also functions as an essential aspect of an emotional relationship betweentwo people. In this way Mann gives the X-ray a place in the cultural context of hu-man relations.\" This exchange between Van Dijck and Zwijnenberg is typical of the manner in which they engage in the debate with other academic disciplines. Van Dijck,professor of media studies and dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the Univer-sity of Amsterdam, and Zwijnenberg, professor of art history at Leiden Univer-sity, are both in favour of a more offensive, self-assured stance for academics228in the humanities, who they believe have withdrawn too far into their own cir- cles and have left the public debate about the big social issues to prominent representatives of the natural and social sciences. It is their belief that this debate will be enriched if humanities academics distance themselves less from everydayreality. That was one of the aims of Transformations in Art and Culture, the NWO project that is the subject of this book. The programme had to do justice to thehumanities' view of the repercussions that changes in society have on art and cul-ture, both nationally and globally, and to the research methods and the social rel-evance of the disciplines in the humanities . The initiators resolutely did not wish to restrict themselves to a closed-off period in which meanings are static andserve as hallmarks of a coherent cultural system. Although it remains essential toconsider the historical continuity of cultural processes, they sought a connectionwith the here and now based on the idea that art and culture are contested andmutable concepts. This discontinuity is at least as important as continuity where academic the- ory and reflection are concerned. How art and culture are interpreted is both areflection of social processes and the effect of social changes. It was for this rea-son that the research programme focused on ongoing cultural changes: global-ization, commercialization and technologization, the three meta-tendencies thathave radically reshaped the world since the Second World War. The programme had to answer \"urgent social questions\" in order to demon- strate that the humanities are still socially relevant today. This was Van Dijck'sand Zwijnenberg's stance in the prospectus they wrote in September 2002 inwhich they outlined the programme's aims. In their opinion, the need to answer\"urgent social questions\" has lost nothing of its urgency. \"Take the brain scansto which the Churchlands attach so much significance. Much of the informationprovided by the newest scans cannot be interpreted precisely,\" says Van Dijck.\"It involves a great deal of hermeneutics. Nonetheless, brain scans are alreadybeing admitted as evidence in court.\" Zwijnenberg: \"In the trial of JohnLennon's murderer, his brain scan was produced as evidence. Humanities aca-demics should have challenged that! They should have pointed out the strange-ness of this practice.\" Van Dijck: \"Interpreting these scans is not an exact sci-ence, so it is strange that a suspect can be criminalized because there is a littleyellow block somewhere on his scan. These are the critical questions thathumanities academics should pose.\" Neuroscientists are unlikely to pose such questions, echoes Zwijnenberg .\"A colleague such as neurobiologist Dick Swaab announces with great aplomb thatwe, humans, are simply our brain. And there is hardly a response. But of course we are more than just our brain. We are also our body and mind. Swaab presentshis proposition, without a hint of doubt and without qualification, as the indis-229 By Marcel ten Hoovenputable truth with hardly any objection from academics in the humanities. Where are they?\" The question is why do humanities academics not stand up and say: \"Believ- ing that there is no such thing as the human mind is the same as believing that the earth is flat.\" According to Zwijnenberg, academics in the humanities have neg-lected their traditional role in public debates about science and in the discussionabout what happens in the world of technology. To his mind, they remain toomuch at the margins and show too little willingness to win back their old role.Zwijnenberg: \"Philosophers and theologists certainly consider such questionsbut we hear too little from them. Though I should add that access to the publicdebate is difficult because it is a debate without nuance. It is a debate ofunabashed, robust statements: pro and contra.\" Van Dijck: \"That timidity may also be because academics in the humanities think that they are unqualified to judge because they lack technical knowledge.There is a kind of crippling fear of technological knowledge.\" But technical scientists who confidently air their knowledge are not held back by the thought that they lack the knowledge of academics in the humanities. Van Dijck: \"Theysee no problem in that at all, because they believe that anyone can join in thedebate about the humanities.\" Zwijnenberg: \"Yes, that's part of the problem.\"Van Dijck: \"Many people think that the humanities do not have disciplinary spe-cialities but they merely cover subjects about which one simply has an opinion.\" Zwijnenberg recounts a discussion about the necessity of multidisciplinary research in which an environmental scientist in Wageningen said that he and hiscolleagues needed to be left in peace for another five years and they would havesolved the environmental problem. According to Zwijnenberg, his scientific col-league was not open to the idea that thinking about ecological problems alsorequires thinking about culture. Zwijnenberg: \"There seems to be an unwrittenhierarchy. Swaab or one of his colleagues will get invited onto a popular newschat show such as [the Dutch late-night television talk show] Pauw & Witteman and someone from the humanities is allowed to comment from the sidelines andis thus forced into a defensive position.\" Van Dijck: \"This hierarchy is determined by binary oppositions. On the one side we have scientists who work with empirical knowledge. And on the otherside there are theologists and philosophers who have beliefs, convictions orobjections.\" Zwijnenberg: \"In my opinion, humanities academics must also takea long hard look at themselves. They have not been sufficiently self-critical. Theyare seldomly trained in speaking a language that would enable them to addressthe world of science with some authority. And as a result they have become side-tracked. This is a bit of a generalization but in essence this is what has hap-pened.\" Zwijnenberg criticizes the urge within the humanities to withdraw into a pro-230 interview with jos\u00e9 van dijck and robert zwijnenbergtective cocoon of familiarity. He supposes that this tendency arises from the idea that it is difficult to explain to the outside world what the humanities do. Zwij-nenberg: \"At the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences we have dis-cussed how humanities academics can explain to society why they are useful.Then you see the panic setting in. 'But we are important for our culture, aren'twe?' is the tenor. But why? That remains difficult to answer.\" To the question \"What is the use of the humanities?\", he answers: \"We all have certain ways of knowing how societies have developed historically, ethi-cally, culturally and religiously, about how political structures have risen andfallen. We are used to thinking about such things. We can, for example, drawparallels between contemporary immigration and immigration in the GoldenAge. We have a long tradition of philosophizing about the good life , aboutmorality and ethics. That is all useful knowledge.\" The humanities can also see technologies from more than a single perspective and thus expose unexpected aspects. The life sciences are the area in whichmajor innovative research is currently being conducted, with possibly far-reach-ing consequences. Predictive medicine is making revolutionary progress thanksto developments in genetic engineering. There is even talk of technical means ofimproving the workings of the human brain. Zwijnenberg: \"Imagine that a rich person is soon able to make himself more intelligent than other people. That could have enormous consequences. What docommercial practices of brain enhancement mean for our democracy? To whatextent would ideals such as liberty, equality and fraternity still be tenable? Fran-cis Fukuyama has written about this. These kinds of questions about the implica-tions of new technologies are best left to academics in the humanities. If PaulChurchland says that the mind does not exist and that thought is purely a chainreaction between neurons, then academics in the humanities can argue that weapparently have no free will. Imagine what that would mean for society!\" Zwijnenberg has talked about a crisis in the humanities. He explains: \"The humanities comprise a number of venerable disciplines with their own traditionsand methods that are indispensable for interpreting human existence. To mymind, they have burrowed too far into their own worlds. The art historians havecontact with the museums; the linguists with their institutions etc. That is what Imeant.\" Van Dijck responds: \"In my view, crisis is too strong a word and its meaning has become attenuated. I find it fascinating that my students are not bound at allby these strict frameworks. They are very creative in conceiving new methodsand do not hesitate to make excursions into other disciplines such as economicsor computer logic. I think that is a great development. This change has occurredvery quickly. Myself, I had great difficulty in taking that leap. I was educatedstrictly within the boundaries of a single framework. I have been working in231 By Marcel ten Hoovenmedia studies since the 1980s even though I was trained in literary theory: in the characteristics of texts, in narrative structures. I have attempted to apply mytext-specific methods to visual and media products. That has not been easy,being so strictly educated in a single discipline. By contrast, my students haveabsolutely no problem with this. I find that very encouraging. Occasionally theyrisk the danger of widening their scope too broadly, and then I need to convincethem that they can also demonstrate their mastery through limitations.\" II A greater \"methodological openness\" was one of the aims of the Transformations project. The initiators detected high walls between the various disciplines in thehumanities that impeded a fruitful synthesis of the one with the other. While it istrue that the humanities enjoy a long tradition of interdisciplinary research, expe-rience shows that when it comes to carrying out that research there are sometimesbarriers between disciplines, faculties and universities. According to Van Dijckand Zwijnenberg, even young disciplines such as film and television studies havea tendency to mark off their own territory. In general terms, research in the humanities is frequently restricted to a specific field or a tightly defined subject. Interdisciplinary research rarely prioritizes thehistorical evolution of cultural change. The Transformations research programme may be seen as a laboratory for the enrichment of various disciplinary structures. In the name of methodologicalopenness a conscious decision was taken not to adopt a specific definition ofmethods or approaches. This offered greater freedom and flexibility to create afertile intellectual environment. The initiators believed that it was only throughthis methodological openness that it would be possible to encompass the com-plex of changes that has occurred in the context of globalization, commercializa-tion and technologization. The results of the research programme had to be innovative and pioneering at an international level. By tearing down the barriers between the different disci-plines, the humanities would be able to win back greater social relevance. I askedZwijnenberg and Van Dijck if this goal had been achieved. Zwijnenberg: \"At thetime that Jos\u00e9 and I wrote the prospectus, in 2001, traditional disciplines wereundergoing transformation; new research subjects were presenting themselvesand new media were emerging. Using different methods and approaches, wewanted the project to explore the interaction between art, culture and society.How do you marry academic knowledge and artistic skills and knowledge?\" Van Dijck: \"In 2001 we chose three themes: technologization, commercializa- tion and globalization. In retrospect, that was quite revolutionary. Since then,232 interview with jos\u00e9 van dijck and robert zwijnenbergthe impact of these three developments has become poignantly clear, especially the impact of technologization, in particular digitization. That was not so easy topredict in 2001. The social media did not yet exist, or only in rudimentary form.In writing that document we very consciously wanted to look at the humanitiesin a different way. The world has problems. The humanities are divided into dis-ciplines and that restricts their view of these problems. People look at problemsin terms of their discipline, in terms of art history, philosophy or languages. What can the humanities offer - jointly - to increase our understanding of theworld's problems? That is our approach. Globalization is an enormously impor-tant development. As boundaries lose their relevance, states disintegrate, there isa massive increase in urbanization and new streams of migration emerge - thisopens up a huge field of new questions about which the humanities must havesomething to say. Technologization? Strangely, some academics in the humani-ties are quick to say that that has nothing to do with them because the subjectregards information science or the social sciences. That is a great mistake. Com-mercialization, for that matter, is not only a topic for economists. We should notunderestimate the role that commercialization plays in the arts, culture and themedia. Technologization, commercialization and globalization are three themesthat we in the humanities must engage with.\" Zwijnenberg: \"In retrospect, the choice of globalization, commercialization and technologization was fortuitous because these themes are not traditionallyassociated with the humanities. In this way we forced project participants tobreak through the boundaries of their disciplines and to embrace these themeswithin their humanities remit.\" Van Dijck: \"More so than now, at the start of the project the humanities were seen as a sort of footnote to the other sciences. For example, with the emergenceof genomics it was clear that this new field had an ethical dimension, and so theynaturally turned to ethicists. But genomics also has broader socio-cultural impli-cations, because it changes our view of who we are and what humans stand for.Scientists also need scholars trained in the humanities. In 2001 I was approachedby a new colleague in computer sciences, a hardcore information scientist, whowas refining search engines to recognize images from digital archives. That is atechnique in which images are translated into specific algorithms. He told methat he needed to know what the formal characteristics of genres are in order todevelop this technology. Otherwise he would be unable to create algorithms thatcould recognize specific images as a melodrama or a Western. And so he came tothe humanities.\" That was in 2001. Van Dijck says that in order to fully understand a digital game a researcher must go a step further and must consider perspectives from thehumanities, the exact sciences and the social sciences in conjunction. Van Dijck: \"You need not only have to know a lot about narrative structures - about the233 By Marcel ten Hoovenconstruction of stories throughout history - but also about technology. And you also have to know a lot about a game's potential users, how they react psycho-logically depending on environmental factors. Content, technology and users aremutually shaped. If you understand that, you can see how ingeniously games areconstructed. Only then can you understand that the narrative structure of gamesis entirely determined by their techno-economic logic, as one of my Ph.D. stu-dents has examined. From an economic point of view it is best to offer the tech-nology that is required for a particular game in phases, so first the hardware,then new software and then all sorts of new packages that can be ordered online.This forces producers to adapt the narrative structure to this techno-economiclogic. Although we can explain much of the world of gaming using the old-fash-ioned methods, such as narrative structures from literary theory, these methodswill not help me in understanding a complex product like computer games. Bycontrast, my students have far less difficulty in making the required leap. I thinkthat is great.\" \"Our project has contributed to a greater realization among humanities aca- demics that digitization opens up a world of unprecedented research possibili-ties. You can now see this at work across the humanities, from art history to lan-guages and from archaeology to cultural studies. Archaeologists and arthistorians are making their data recognizable for search engines in order toestablish connections and recognize patterns that were practically untraceablepreviously. This enables researchers to pose questions that they could not previ-ously formulate.\" III The Transformations project recognized the need to capitalize on the interests of new generations of graduates intent on undertaking academic research. Theprospectus promised to create a fertile intellectual environment that would dojustice to their interdisciplinary focus and broad curiosity. Van Dijck and Zwij-nenberg believe that the project was successful in this respect. Zwijnenberg:\"Academics of my generation still occasionally have difficulty with the limits ofour discipline, but I see that my doctoral students are able to look beyond theseboundaries. I bring humanities and science students together: an artist gives alecture to scientists who usually work in a laboratory and my art history studentsare prepared to undertake research into genetics and DNA.\" When asked whether this is a difference between her generation and the gen- eration of digital natives - those who have grown up with computers and othertechnologies, Van Dijck answers: \"In the past, working beyond the limits of yourown discipline felt very uncomfortable. Academics in the humanities now seethat technology is not only something that is in their computer but has gradually234 interview with jos\u00e9 van dijck and robert zwijnenbergbecome an integral part of their academic methodology, a defining element within their patterns of thought.\" Zwijnenberg: \"In this respect technology canmore precisely be referred to as a cultural phenomenon than as something spe-cific to a new generation. In the sense that technology is not something externalto us - a tool for performing useful tasks - but is an integral part of our culture.We no longer experience it as a threat. That's certainly true of the generations forwhom digital technology is second nature. It is therefore a generational and acultural phenomenon.\" Digital technologies are often enthusiastically hailed as a tool advancing democracy, while they have also been detracted as being commercially exploit-ing. Van Dijck: \"I am neither a techno-utopian nor a techno-cynic, but a techno-critic. You must maintain a critical distance from technology, certainly if youwant to master it. Take, for example, the revolutions in the Middle East. I readsomewhere that Facebook had brought about these revolutions. I think that is astupid conclusion. A hammer does not make a war. Facebook was an instrumentin the hands of forces that had long wished to overthrow outdated regimes. It is aform of techno-utopianism to say that Facebook can bring about a revolution,just as it is a form of techno-cynicism to say that you want nothing to do withFacebook because you see it as a purely commercial venture. A techno-criticalposition demands that you investigate a new technology and unravel it in orderto understand its commercial, cultural, political and economic impact.\" Newtechnologies such as Facebook have made the revolutions in the Middle Eastpossible, but they did not cause them. Van Dijck: \"I believe that the technologywill, in turn, be influenced by what has happened in the Middle East. Facebookis changing its logistics because of these events.\" One of the aims of the Transformations project was to bring about collabora- tion between artists and scientists. Artists can use the power of their imaginationto expose ethical dilemmas in scientific theories to which scientists remain blind.It remains the question whether or not scientists will be open to such an idea or,like Paul Churchland, will adopt a confrontational stance. Zwijnenberg: \"I have noticed that scientists are generally very sensitive to criticism. And that's understandable. Practitioners of the exact sciences are tar-nished by the image that they are lost in their theories and have a limited view ofthe moral implications of their work. The outside world often views them asheartless. I find that problematic when I want to enter into a partnership withthem. I literally bring artists into the laboratory, where I let them work and makeart. Sometimes the scientists clam up, especially if I tell them that the intention isto lend a critical note to their work. My starting point is that it is good to philos-ophize about the possible negative aspects right from the outset, preciselybecause they will eventually wish to apply their discoveries in the real world. Iattempt to convince them that artists and scientists can help each other in this235 By Marcel ten Hoovenway. Some of them want absolutely nothing to do with us, while others are enthusiastic about the initiative.\" \"I am currently working with the American artist Adam Zaretsky. He calls himself a bio-artist, which means that he works with living materials. He and Iare involved in a large research project about bio-solar cells, living cells that areused in the development of solar energy. You can imagine that this project isteeming with moral questions. Some of the scientists involved keenly understandthat the use of living organisms to supply our energy needs could give rise tosocial objections. They welcome Zaretsky. With his knowledge of living matterhe should be able get to work immediately in a laboratory, but he does unex-pected things with his knowledge; for example, he created a two-headedzebrafish embryo. Zebrafishes are model animals that life scientists use for theirresearch. They are allowed to use these animals because they are practising sci-ence, so why shouldn't an artist be able to do the same? Zaretsky is concernednot with an artistic, aesthetic image but with entering into a critical dialoguewith the scientists to force them to ask themselves: \"What are we actuallydoing?\" Zaretsky seeks conflict. As an artist he stirs up all kinds of ethical ques-tions that scientists do not usually see as confrontational. That is the clash ofpublic and scientific ethics. I find that clash fruitful.\" Van Dijck: \"Scientists can be very engrossed in their work, in such a way that they forget to ask themselves what their work means in the concrete reality of theeveryday.\" Zwijnenberg: \"I have encountered colleagues in the exact sciences who enjoy to work with us. The artist Marta de Menezes has worked in Leiden in a lab witha biologist, Paul Brakefield, who is carrying out research into the distortion ofbutterflies. Brakefield is enthusiastic about her presence. By introducing smallchanges in the chrysalis phase, Menezes manipulates the butterflies' structure toproduce unique examples that would not have occurred naturally. She learnedthis technique in the laboratory. Is an artist permitted to do this? If not, whyshould a biologist be able to do so? Here too, an artist raises questions about thetension between public and scientific morals. In the laboratory ethical bound-aries are constantly being tested by scientists who claim that right because theybelieve that their work advances human life. And that may indeed be the case,but with all these areas of ambiguity it can certainly do no harm to involve a crit-ical outsider with the imagination of an artist in these sorts of projects. I find thatinteresting, also from the point of view of the humanities. In our discipline wecan learn from artists who enter into a critical dialogue with scientists. We mustdo the same.\" Van Dijck: \"In the meantime I am supervising a couple of doctoral students who come from the arts. They have become enormously intrigued by what sci-ence can do with art. One of them was a ballerina in the Turkish national ballet.236 interview with jos\u00e9 van dijck and robert zwijnenbergShe suffered from a sustained knee injury at the age of 23 and decided to retrain. Through an accident she has landed in academia and considers herself verylucky. She is able to use her experience in the arts to reach a higher academiclevel. She is working towards a doctorate on the role that digital technologiescan play in dance. An entirely new form of dance has arisen thanks to computersoftware, so that dance and the computer are engaged in a continuing inter-change. Particular kinds of movement are stimulated by computer-generatedimages and vice versa. This has created new forms of dance influenced by tech-nology. My doctoral student has interviewed numerous dancers and technolo-gists. She has asked them what their profession entails. To what extent are theydancers, choreographers, or software engineers? The worlds of creative arts andengineering are becoming intertwined.\" Zwijnenberg: \"That is a highly relevant development. We frequently discuss this in my field. Will the new art emerge from science? Think, for example of syn-thetic biology, a discipline that involves the design of viruses pushes the bound-aries of aesthetics and ethics. And that is what artists do par excellence. In thisrespect, they occupy the same territory as the life scientists and the synthetic biol-ogists. An artist can react to this situation as Adam Zaretsky has done and carveout a role for himself in the debate about the life sciences or he can continue topaint in his studio. In art historical education these sorts of transformations arebarely discussed, even though such developments pose the highly relevant ques-tion as to what is the social role of art in our time. What makes art somethingmore than a pleasing aesthetic comment on reality, a nice picture? That isincreasingly difficult to define.\" \"In essence this question concerns how art can be a counterforce in society. My first impulse is to be irritated by this question. It seems so old-fashioned. Oneis immediately reminded of the social role that artists played in the 1960s and1970s. But upon closer inspection it is entirely relevant. Art is a specific criticalfactor in our cultural consciousness, a unique counterforce that is, to my mind,indispensable. Artists must therefore participate in the debate about society. Theart of the avant-garde since the beginning of the twentieth century was a reflec-tion of artists' grappling with the big issues of the period, but also with new dis-ciplines, such as psychology, and with all manner of technological innovations.Things are different now. Now, as then, some artists consciously dissociate them-selves from this. They make art for art's sake. And I can enjoy that and be movedby it, but I expect more from art. Artists should not be lumbered with the job ofprettifying and thus lubricating society.\" Van Dijck: \"I recall an exhibition at Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen with beautiful images from the biosciences. Beautiful photographs of a cell with won-derful colours and forms. But that is just the aesthetics of science.\" Zwijnenberg:\"That is a flat view of art, reduced to pure beauty.\"237 By Marcel ten HoovenZwijnenberg agrees that this also renders art innocent. \"Yes. Zaretsky has attempted to give an embryonic zebrafish two heads. In so doing, he poses the dangerous questions that pervade the life sciences, such as eugenics, that wouldremain forever in the background without the intervention of an artist. Zaretskyposes these questions openly.\" Interesting art, work that stands the test of time, is art that exerts some form of criticism. From the French Realist painters, to Dutch avant-gardists such asTheo van Doesburg, to Anselm Kiefer today. All are artists that have had some-thing to say. Van Dijck: \"They were not interested in pure aestheticism. Unfortu-nately, I have the impression that art's critical dimension - the ability to posequestions that others do not ask - is less recognized than earlier, or is possiblyeven denied. That is, I'm afraid, to some extent a consequence of the democrati-zation of media, and in particular social media such as the Internet. Now every-one can make something artistic or write something, or at least they think they can. This undermines the idea that art and journalism involve skill. Someonewho writes a nice piece and posts it on the web is not a journalist, just as some-one who makes a nice collage is not necessarily an artist. Professionalism in artdemands knowledge, skill and experience in making choices and in posing criti-cal questions.\" Zwijnenberg: \"Hegel said as early as the beginning of the nineteenth century that art no longer had any function for the development of thought, that art hadalready reached its peak. Perhaps he was right. Perhaps art is no longer capableof fulfilling the function we attribute to it.\" However, one of the insights that the Transformations project has provided, Zwijnenberg recognizes, is precisely that art can advance thinking. \"Okay, let'sformulate it in positive terms. Bio-artists such as Adam Zaretsky and Marta deMenezes certainly do that and they are certainly not the only ones. That gives mehope.\" IV In addition to globalization, commercialization and technologization, the Trans- formations project also considered numerous other social processes and their effects on art and culture as themes for research. Democratization, emancipa-tion, increased participation in education, individualization and modernizationhave all exerted specific influences on the makers of art and their public. How-ever, the choice fell upon globalization, commercialization and technologizationbecause of their mutual cohesion, international dimension, social urgency andthe relevance of these phenomena. They may also be seen as new manifestations of social and cultural develop- ments that have taken place over a longer historical period. What we now call238 interview with jos\u00e9 van dijck and robert zwijnenbergglobalization can be seen as a new stage in the geographical diffusion of cultural products in which cultural elements initially viewed as strange fuse with familiarones. Commercialization, or the market mentality, is not a phenomenon that hasarisen in the twentieth century, in the sense that art and culture have always beensubject to the processes of competition. And a technological innovation such asdigitization can been seen, in historical terms, as a new phase in the age-oldprocess of renewal of the technologies of production and reproduction. Despite this longer historical trajectory, it is evident that globalization, com- mercialization and technologization influence the very nature of artistic practicein our time. Through globalization, the United States and Europe exert a world-wide influence on culture, resulting in the erosion of authentic local, regionaland national cultures. But this process of homogenization is countered by thefact that migration and unparalleled communications technologies have broughtall manner of non-Western cultures to the attention of a global public. There isnow a world market for art and culture. Commercialization has had the effect that artistic change results increasingly from new cultural markets or media and less as a consequence of governmentcultural policy, albeit sometimes as a result of government arts cuts. Throughtechnologization, digital art has won a place alongside traditional art forms.Computer-driven processes of production, distribution and reception havealtered not only the cultural repertoire but also the experience and appreciationof art. All in all globalization, commercialization and technologization have brought about a reshuffling of cultural forms. Hybrid art forms have emerged and thedistinction between high and low culture has blurred to a large degree. This dis-tinction has become arbitrary and relative, although cultural elites will continueto draw a distinction between acceptable and unacceptable art forms. New gen-res emerge, old genres develop new content. Commercial interests converge withcreative processes, giving rise to new professions at the borders of the two, suchas video games, fashion, advertising and television documentaries. If old means of expression, such as text and imagery, do not change in nature, new hybrids emerge. Globalization, commercialization and technologizationalso influence ethical and aesthetic views of culture and the values and norms towhich they give expression. And the public changes just as much as the makersand their art. The blurred distinction between high and low culture has altered the signifi- cance of creativity and professionalism and it has become difficult to distinguishbetween the specific professions of artist and cultural producer. Genres oncedefined as low culture, such as pop music, cartoons, youth literature and webart, have achieved a higher status, and art forms that previously belonged strictlyto the domain of high culture, such as classical or contemporary classical music,239 By Marcel ten Hoovenare now being fused with cultural expressions that formerly had a low status such as pop and jazz. Zwijnenberg says that the effects that globalization, commercialization and technologization have on artistic practice interconnect. \"The consolidationmade possible by new technologies alters the meaning of artistic authenticity andredefines artistic practice as the most individualistic expression of the most per-sonal emotions. Although it need not necessarily be the case, artists can compro-mise their professional integrity if they are enlisted by commercial enterprises forthe development and exploitation of new technologies. Think of the new artforms that have emerged on the Internet, think of the use of new media as artisticsources. This can all have consequences for artistic practice.\" \"These are interesting developments for consideration. Artists do that too, in their own way. We hoped that reflection on these issues would flourish in CO-OPs, a subproject of Transformations. This raised the question of how artisticknowledge and skill can be part of public and academic debate. Artists and academics worked together in CO-OPs on the three big themes: globalization, commercialization and technologization. However, the reflection upon artisticpractice in CO-OPs was disappointing. It delivered less than we had hoped for,leaving aside some positive outcomes.\" Van Dijck: \"Artistic practice and science occasionally merge. One of the doc- toral students in the subproject on digital games wrote a dissertation about theprinciples of gaming. Over a period of time he gradually became an artist andnow exhibits in America and Amsterdam and lectures at the [Gerrit] RietveldAcademie [for fine arts and design]. He is one of the new media artists who usedigital technologies as their medium. Is this a good result of the project? Is hismetamorphosis a loss for academia or a gain for the arts?\" It is possible that thanks to his artistic talent this researcher has made a contri- bution to academic thought and that thanks to his academic talent he hasbecome a good artist. Van Dijck is not sure. She agrees with Zwijnenberg thatthey had greater expectations about the reflection of these issues in the Transfor- mations project, but it has nonetheless produced new insights and theories. Van Dijck: \"For example, another researcher sets up urban projects in the creativerealm. To do so he employs new communications technologies that stem fromlocative media, such as smartphones. He has received lots of commissions and earns a living as a freelancer. He has organized projects in China. It would beinteresting to ask these doctoral students what their professional identity is. Dothey see themselves more as scientists or artists? Or would they call themselvesproject coordinators?\" The art that both these students practise is applicable and recognizable throughout the world. Their work is the appealing result of a process in which aworld market for art and culture has arisen thanks to globalization, commercial-240 interview with jos\u00e9 van dijck and robert zwijnenbergization and technologization. Both artists and their public participate in this development, thus giving an impulse to the fusion of cultural elements from allparts of the world. Van Dijck: \"I cannot imagine artists who operate in a more global fashion than these two doctoral students. They cater to an international market and aninternational audience. Their concepts are global, unhindered by borders or lan-guage. They have focused entirely on the world at large and do not feel bound tothe Netherlands. Where they work or exhibit is secondary to what they do. Theytake their art all over the world. They are both models for a new generation ofartists. Nowadays all sorts of artistic ventures begin as international projects andare carried out in various countries. This is easier to achieve today, certainly withdigital media, which recognize no boundaries.\" Zwijnenberg: \"They are excellent examples of people who have been trained in the humanities who are now active in the fields overlapping various culturalactivities. Perhaps this is the future of the humanities and we are looking at anew generation of researchers. This will take a little getting used to. We cannotyet comprehend this completely. It is significant that this phenomenon hasexisted longer abroad: humanities academics, researchers or even professorswho also engage in cultural practice. I know colleagues in England who lectureat university and are also involved in the Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht.\" Van Dijck: \"The NWO Research] has introduced a new category: Ph.D. research in the arts. These are doctoralpositions for artists. This has existed for some time in England: artists who alsophilosophize about their practice.\" Zwijnenberg: \"The projects that made up Transformations have contributed to the emergence of a different kind of researcher than those we are used to. Theyare entrepreneurs, even in their capacity as humanities academics. Another resultof the projects is that subjects that are of great importance to the humanities,such as our three big themes, have now become normal topics of research in ouracademic branch.\" Van Dijck: \"Ten or fifteen years ago globalization, commercialization and technologization were not themes dealt with by the humanities. We were con-cerned with linguistics or literary theory, literature or the history of the art of theseventeenth century. For example, a historian might know everything about theperiod from 1780 to 1786. I still believe that this kind of specialist knowledge isof great value, but ... \" Zwijnenberg: \"One type of knowledge does not exclude the other ... \" Van Dijck: \"Exactly. Indeed, I think that one form of knowledge can strengthen the other. Think of digitization. Historians and art historians in myfaculty are gradually discovering the world of possibilities afforded by new digi-tized sources and databases. These files are a great source of unanticipated241 By Marcel ten Hoovenknowledge. I can discover interesting correlations if I can see at the touch of a button the incidence and frequency of particular words in the Bible and in thedigitized medieval edition of Van den Vos Reynaerde. Previously these connec- tions would have remained hidden from me. I would have required two lifetimesto make these associations. Thanks to this new technology I can suddenly poseall manner of new questions.\" \"Digitization has brought about a process of methodological renewal in the humanities. That process has consequences that extend far beyond the need tostore everything digitally. Libraries were the first to begin transferring informa-tion to digital files. That required years of work for art institutions and muse-ums. This process is nearing completion and we must now ask ourselves what wecan actually do with all this material. What can we deduce from it, what can wesee in it? That is why my computer sciences colleague's request to teach himabout genres is so important both for science and the humanities.\" Zwijnenberg believes that the Transformations project has introduced a new form of systematic knowledge and new areas of research in the humanities. Healso points to an increasing realization among historians of the value of classicalhistorical knowledge. Zwijnenberg: \"Amid all the political uproar about immi-gration, historians have pointed out that the Netherlands has been a destinationfor emigrants for centuries, and certainly not to its detriment. Historians aredeveloping a public profile. They have something to offer: historical knowledgethat allows them to provide meaningful commentary on our times. That too is again. From the very beginning of the project we impressed upon the participantsthat the focus on new themes did not mean jettisoning the old. On the contrary,the critical function of the humanities based on historical knowledge and cul-tural expertise is something that we must nurture.\" Van Dijck: \"I hope that historians are not taken in by the idea that young peo- ple spend all their time playing video games and that they will therefore not pro-duce any good historians. I would refer them to the phenomenon of serious gam-ing, a form of teaching that is being used more and more in schools. History isnot only a summation of facts but also a constellation of interpretations of facts.And games are just the same. Take slavery, for example. If through a game youcan succeed in getting children to look at slavery from more than one viewpoint- through the eyes of the slave and the slave dealer and the plantation owner -then children learn to look at slavery in a critical manner, in a different way thanthey would from a book. And isn't it more interesting for children to look at his-tory in this way?\" Van Dijck believes that, in this respect too, the project has fulfilled the aim of bringing about greater \"methodological openness\" and in uniting aspects of aca-demia that were unjustly divided. She says that some doctoral students are ableto operate in commercial circuits without sacrificing their critical stance. One of242 interview with jos\u00e9 van dijck and robert zwijnenbergthem wrote a dissertation on blockbuster games, developed and produced by commercial giants such as Sony. Van Dijck: \"Those sorts of games hold the play-ers captive in cycles of new purchases. You may as well throw the game away ifyou don't get swept along in the cycle. The innovation is therefore not so muchtechnologically motivated, but commercially. These games must constantly earnmoney. It is not possible to write a dissertation about such a phenomenon with-out an in-depth analysis of the economic aspects of the games industry.\" \"And you have to have mastered the games in detail. I once spent an evening with this student playing a war game in which you have to take up strategic mili-tary positions. It is no surprise to me that he was once asked to explain to theleaders of the Dutch army, air force and navy how these games work. He com-pletely deconstructed the game for them to show its workings. And he can do thesame with the manufacturers' commercial techniques. He attends the gamescompanies' PR events as a journalist. He is forced to go in that capacity becauseSony invites journalists but not critical academics. He consciously sets himselfup as a pawn in the industry without renouncing his responsibilities as an aca-demic. It is not a working method that would occur to me personally, but it cer-tainly delivers results.\" V Globalization, commercialization and technologization have brought about aserious countermovement in the form of populism. Historically, cultural objectsand cultural practices contributed to a sense of community. Globalization, com-mercialization and technologization interrupt both the older common identifica-tions based on religion, language or historical consciousness and those based onemancipatory ideals. The attendant institutions, such as churches, schools, thefamily and other vehicles of cultural transmission, are changing or even losingtheir functions. This unleashes a demand for new certainties, in which people with less immu- nity to cultural change and diversity experience an increasing tension with thecomplex, rapidly changing reality. Populism, an extreme variant of resistance tothe new age, also turns aggressively against the arts. The irony is that the projecthas demonstrated that it is precisely the arts that can help us to reach a betterunderstanding of globalization, commercialization and technologization. Thequestion is whether this offers the arts the perfect opportunity to shake off thataggressive atmosphere. Zwijnenberg: \"That may well be so. But the lesson I take from the pro- gramme is that artists themselves need to think more about their own specificcontribution to the political debate. What can art offer that debate? In the debateabout terrorism, for example, art can contribute a unique image of what war is.243 About the authorsThe representation of war is currently dominated by the media, which provides us with a relatively one-dimensional, uniform, period-specific image. But takethe series of etchings that Francisco Goya made about the horrors of war. Usingartistic means, he created an image of war that transcends time and place. And,although it may be a clich\u00e9d example, Picasso's Guernica still has significance for us as a singular expression of the Spanish Civil War.\" Zwijnenberg concurs that art can give universal significance to incidental events. \"Yes, because art is a form of aesthetic representation. Art is not simplyan illustration of an event, like a press photograph, but involves the viewer inquestions about what this event represents. An artist, whether a writer, photog-rapher or film-maker, can tell a more penetrating story than someone whose pro-fession ties them to strict, objective conventions. I see the debate about represen-tations of the Holocaust as a typically artistic debate with political and socialovertones. Authors such as Paul Celan and Primo Levi initiated that debate. Itwas taken up again later in the dispute between Steven Spielberg, the director ofSchindler's List, and Claude Lanzmann, the maker of Shoah. Lanzmannreproached his American colleague for turning the Holocaust into a filmic his-tory with a happy ending. Spielberg praised Shoah as a brilliant documentary, but for a very small audience. It was his contention that thanks to Schindler's Listmore people would go to see Shoah. He said that each film had contributed in its own way to the fight against forgetting.\" Van Dijck: \"A photograph or a film is not something. It becomes something thanks to the power of the image and thanks to the context in which it is viewed. For example, Susan Sontag made a theatre piece in Sarajevo about the BalkanWars. Because she made the piece with Bosnians who had just experienced thetraumatic events in their city, the piece had an enormous impact, even beyondSarajevo. The same performance would have had nowhere near the same effectin New York. I would find it interesting to ask those people who think that art isa superfluous left-wing hobby to imagine a world without art. Such a worldwould be impossible.\" Zwijnenberg: \"But for many people that is precisely thereality as they experience it: a world without art.\" To the question what artists can do themselves to make their relevance clearer, Zwijnenberg replies: \"Not by making artificially fun, beautiful and risk-freework or by trying to flatter the general public in other ways. Artists also have toeat, so it is no disgrace to listen to the demands of the market as long as they donot lose sight of their critical function. The critical potential of art is of value tous all.\" Van Dijck: \"That is an essential function of art and of the humanities.\"Zwijnenberg: \"And critical does not necessarily mean that you are for or againstsomething. It means that you think about things in an engaged fashion.\" VanDijck: \"Engaged and analytical.\"244 interview with jos\u00e9 van dijck and robert zwijnenbergAbout the Authors Historian Karin Bijsterveld is professor in the Department of Technology and Society Studies, Maastricht University.

Jeroen Werner works and lives in Amsterdam. After having started out as a painter, sculptor and photographer, he grew interested in the behaviour of images. He replaced the classical vehicles of visual representation (canvas, paper,board) with transparent or reflecting ones (plates made of glass, aluminium, andPerspex), a new interest that gave rise to spatial works and works that could beprojected, while a mode of painting based on drawing produced sculpturalforms. More recently, digital technology and their everyday use allowed him tointegrate image processing and the design of \"artworks and devices\". Theseworks can be viewed scientically as well as sculpturally. Werner's work isshown internationally and is represented in private and public collections,including the Akzo Nobel Art Foundation, ICN (Institute Collection Nether-lands), The Royal Mint and the Amsterdam City Archive.249 About the authorsKitty Zijlmans is professor of Contemporary Art History and Theory at Leiden University and a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sci- ences.
