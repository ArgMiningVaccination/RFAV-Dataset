A thorough treatment plan is customized for each person. Treat the Entire Person, Not Just the Symptoms Naturopathy for mental illness treats the entire individual, calling on science and the person's innate healing abilities. The naturopathic philosophy is the support of and belief in the body's ability to restore itself, given the correct balance of natural resources, to a place of health after suffering effects of trauma, cumulative stress, toxic exposures, and other life challenges. Part of the naturopath's role is to lead the client's rehabilitation process by enhancing consciousness and awareness relating to their own inherent resources. Naturopathic mental health is based on the foundation of teaching the client how to be in charge of their own health care. For example, under medical oversight, Alternative to Meds Center educates clients about self-health-care and makes recommendations regarding treatment options, both traditional and holistic, including traditional Chinese medicine.2 One of our goals is to teach clients to be their own experts in mental health care. Nutritional psychiatry is a relatively new discipline in the field of mental health and is used extensively at the Alternative to Meds Center to assist clients with the changes they want to see in their overall health.6-9 Find and Resolve Troubling Emotional Causes Since mental illness reflects our state of mind and emotions, one objective is to achieve emotional stability. This entails finding and working to resolve sources of troubling emotions, whether they are psychological, physical, or spiritual. Alternative to Meds Center does not regard an individual as just having a brain inside of a body but as a collective brain-body-spirit entity. Emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual issues act and react to each other, creating either health or a lack of health. At Alternative to Meds Center, we have observed that one can benefit from increased stability without prescription drugs. We employ scientifically proven natural, drug-free approaches to stabilize the body and mind.

[Lab testing](https://www.alternativetomeds.com/services/inpatient/lab-tests/) is a powerful tool that can inform the root causes of specific issues that need correction, such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies, the presence of toxins, and even genetic factors that could be assisted with diet or other strategies. Comprehensive Holistic Therapies Naturopathic treatments used in mental health settings can include: - Counseling - Traditional Chines Medicine - Herbal remedies - Exercise & Physical therapy - Orthomolecular therapy - Holistic Detox - Cleansing Counseling: Cognitive behavioral counseling (CBT), one-on-one or group therapy, peer support groups are all recognized as beneficial options in the holistic treatment of psychiatric symptoms. Traditional Chinese Medicine: A vast body of research supports many modes that are derived from TCM, including yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong, meditation, and practicing mindfulness.5 Exercise & Physical Therapy: Exercise is an overlooked but powerful therapy in treating symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Learned deep-breathing techniques, therapeutic massage, and acupuncture, are other examples of physical therapies that can support and benefit improved mental wellness.3 Orthomolecular Therapy: Lab testing can discover nutritional deficiencies that need to be corrected. A corrected diet is essential for the prevention and elimination of diet-related symptoms. Supplementation can provide the body with the raw materials that are most needed for the repair and maintenance of neurochemistry. Holistic Detox & Cleansing: The use of ionic foot baths, saunas, colon hydrotherapy, and other methods of neurotoxin removal can provide a wide range of beneficial effects. Where detox involves coming off prescription or other drugs, naturopathic adjunctive therapies can reduce discomfort throughout the process, and help ensure a successful outcome. 4 Alternative to Meds Center \u2014 A Healing Center At Alternative to Meds Center, naturopathic treatment for mental illness is meant to produce long-term relief from mental health problems.
