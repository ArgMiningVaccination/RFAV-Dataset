The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on all sectors of Indonesian people's lives. One of the sectors that was significantly affected was the health sector. The main factor that can prevent the transmission of the spread of COVID-19 that can hurt our bodies is by implementing a clean and healthy lifestyle and keeping our immune system stable and good. One way to maintain physical and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic is to do spiritual healing which can have an impact in the form of a balanced mindset, mental resilience, and a strong immune system. One example of the application of spiritual healing is yoga. There are various types of yoga and one of them is yoga asanas. By doing yoga asanas, one can rejuvenate the body's skeletal framework, increase appetite, and this technique also helps in treating all digestive organs and can reduce mental tension or stress that can reduce the body's immune power (immunity) in dealing with microbes that interfere with our body. The movements in yoga asanas are Tadasana (Mountain Pose), Vrikshasana (Tree Pose), Adho Mukho Svanasana (Downward Dog Pose), Trikonasana (Triangle Pose), Kursiasana (Chair Pose), Naukasana (Boat Pose), Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose), Paschimottanasana (Forward Hunchback Pose), Balasana (Child Pose) and Sukhasana (Happy Pose). Yoga practice can activate the immune system by activating the thymus gland, which is located in the area between the heart and the breastbone. The thymus gland produces TCells which are a heterogeneous group of cells important in protecting the body against invasion by foreign organisms. With the various benefits described, the concept of spiritual healing, especially the application of yoga asanas, is very suitable to be applied during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to improve body and mental conditions for the better which will have an impact on increasing the body's immunity in preventing the entry of viruses or other antigens that can cause infection. - Copyright - \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
