Afluria\u00ae Quad contains the active ingredient influenza virus haemagglutinin. Afluria\u00ae Quad is a vaccine used to help prevent certain types of influenza or \"flu\". It is for use in people aged 5 years and over. Influenza is caused by infection with specific influenza viruses. New types of influenza viruses can appear each year. Afluria\u00ae Quad contains fragments of four different types of influenza virus. Each year the Australian Influenza Vaccine Committee decides which four types of viruses are most suitable to include in the vaccine. The virus in the vaccine has been killed. Therefore the vaccine cannot give you or your child \"the flu\". Note: the vaccine will not protect you or your child from the other influenza viruses that Afluria\u00ae Quad does not contain. Vaccination against influenza is recommended every year, for anyone wanting to lower their chance of catching influenza. Afluria\u00ae Quad works by causing your body to protect itself against infection by the influenza viruses, types A and B, that are in the vaccine. The vaccine stimulates the body to make substances, called antibodies. Antibodies fight the influenza virus. If you have been vaccinated, when you come into contact with the influenza viruses in the vaccine, your body is usually able quickly to destroy the virus. This prevents you from getting influenza. Your body takes a few weeks after vaccination to fully develop protection against the influenza virus. Protection against influenza generally requires one dose of Afluria\u00ae Quad. Some people including children who have not received influenza vaccination before may require two doses. Most people make satisfactory antibodies against the influenza virus. However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection cannot be guaranteed. The chance of having a severe unwanted reaction after having Afluria\u00ae Quad is very small. Whereas, the risks of not being vaccinated against influenza may be very serious. 2. What should I know before being given Afluria\u00ae Quad?
