This includes non-conventional treatments of acupuncture, herbal concoctions, or even crystal healing. However, due to the prevalence of Covid-19, the force of the pandemic has made even the most conventional patients turn to alternative medicine, especially in developing countries or countries which are facing a distinct lack of manpower in traditional hospitals. By the end of 2020, Thailand's health authorities have cleared the use of an herbal treatment to combat the early stages of Covid-19. Green chiretta, or as it is known by its scientific name of Andrographis paniculata, can not only ease the severity of symptoms in Covid-19 positive patients, but can be used to cut costs of treatment. As local transmissions reach an all time high, both the government and medical sector have no choice but to increase the use of non-traditional treatments. While the Thailand officials have implemented this new practice in 5 of their state-owned hospitals, it is still considered a voluntary treatment which is open to patients aged 18-65 years old. Furthermore, only patients with minor symptoms are able to be eligible for this form of treatment, and can only be conducted within 72 hours upon testing positive. The treatment has been proven effective in patients who received the treatment within 72 hours and there has been no reports of side effects in patients who have taken the [green chiretta herb](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thailand-clears-use-of-herbal-medicine-for-covid-19-treatment). There has also been research regarding THC in the use of patients with Covid-19. The therapeutic effects of marijuana strains such as [Delta 8 THC](https://cannigma.com/plant/delta-8-thc/) may alleviate symptoms of lung disease, a secondary infection that may leave the lungs scarred and cause patients to have deteriorated breathing function. However, there is a substance in THC known as C. Sativa which can help combat this inflammation of the lungs and prevent [lung fibrosis](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/cannabis-as-a-treatment-for-covid-19/106833/). Aside from that, THC can also offer pain management and alleviate anxiety. At the moment, it is not known whether smoking or inhaling cannabis also offers the same benefits as administering CBD oil and other alternative treatments. As Covid-19's most serious symptom is long-lasting side effects of having contracted the disease, being able to fight off lung-related problems are a huge plus in the battle of fighting against the respiratory disease, which is something that [THC](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/cannabis-as-a-treatment-for-covid-19/106833/) is able to fend from. Taking supplements is also one way of being able to keep the virus at bay by strengthening one's immune system. Vitamin C supplements have seen a huge increase in sales [following the pandemic](https://www.eurekaselect.com/189879/article). Unfortunately, health officials have announced that taking supplements does not offer enough protection when it comes to defending against any kind of illness or infection. However, it is worth noting that Vitamin C is an antioxidant and can [neutralize free radicals](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-coronavirus) in the body. In layman terms, the supplement has the potential to \"swallow\" harmful bacteria and harmful particles which are present in the human body. According to Healthline, \"There's also some evidence from animal research and case studies in humans that high dose or IV vitamin C can reduce lung inflammation in severe respiratory illnesses caused by H1N1 (\"swine flu\") or other viruses\" but there isn't enough research done in this department to suggest that anyone should take excessive amounts of vitamin C without the approval of a doctor as it could lead to stomach sensitivity and diarrhea. On the other hand, China has officiated the use of vitamin C to combat symptoms in Covid-19 positive patients. They are also taking the initiative to further research on the anti-inflammatory properties on the disease. According to authorities on the topic, vitamin C has the potential to improve lung function in patients who have contracted the disease. Aside from oral treatments, there is also acupuncture to consider. However, it is only used in post-Covid treatment for patients who are suffering from side effects of the disease including but not limited to decreased lung function and [decreased quality of sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7535668/). According to patients who have received acupunctural treatment, they have also noted improved mood and also better pain management. For millions of Americans who already suffer from chronic pain, THC and acupuncture are great ways for them to manage their conditions. This is due to how acupuncture works. As it places the body in a deep state of relaxation, the body is able to repair itself from within, giving patients a better peace of mind and therefore creating an environment conducive to healing. With the medical sector being overrun by too many patients that they can handle, alternative medicine can give patients a fair chance at recovering from the disease without any long-lasting side effects and also offer them some semblance of a normal life.
