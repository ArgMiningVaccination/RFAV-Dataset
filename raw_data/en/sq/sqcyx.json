Prah By the time Colorado Gov.-elect Bill Ritter claimed victory in Denver on election night last November, Democrats across the nation were feeling a mile high. The Democratic Party had won the trifecta of the Colorado governor's office, the state House and state Senate for the first time in nearly 50 years - and when all the results were in, had swept to power in the U.S. Congress, a majority of governor's mansions and more legislative chambers than anytime since 1994. President George W. Bush's record-low approval ratingsand frustration with the war in Iraq made the 2006midterm elections a wellspring of voter anger. While the presidency wasn't on the ballot, the elections held hugestakes for state leadership with 36 governors' offices and 84percent of legislative seats in 46 states up for grabs. The election largely reversed gains of the 1994 Republicanrevolution. Democrats entered 2007 with 28 governors, andRepublicans with 22, an exact flip of the pre-election head-count. Democrats are in charge in 23 state legislatures wherethey control both chambers, four more than before the elec-tion. Republicans lost chambers in five states and controlboth houses in only 15. At the federal level, Democrats tookcontrol of Congress: 51-49 in the Senate and 233-202 in theHouse. (A Florida race was still disputed at press time.) There were also these political milestones: Two incumbent governors - both Republicans - were ousted: Robert Ehrlich Jr. in Maryland's general electionand Frank Murkowski in the Alaska primary. Massachusetts made history by electing Democrat Deval Patrick as governor, making him only the second African-American to be elected to a state's top office. Virginia's L. Douglas Wilder (D) was the first. Alaska elected its first woman governor, Republican Sarah Palin. Nine women now serve as state chief execu-tives, matching the record set in 1994. Iowa and New Hampshire, scenes of the earliest presiden- tial primary contests in 2008, both elected Democraticgovernors and legislatures. Democrats now dominate thestatehouse in Iowa for the first time in 40 years and inNew Hampshire for the first time since the Civil War. The outcome gave Democrats a political edge going into nextyear's scramble for the presidency, and strengthened theirability to influence the remapping of congressional and leg-islative districts after the 2010 census - if not sooner. But italso left them needing to produce results for an electoratethat exit polls showed was clearly fed up with partisan bick-ering and government gridlock.Many state leaders are drawing lessons from the success ofone Republican, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger,who roared back from a political slump to win re-election bystressing bipartisanship and compromise with a Democraticlegislature.Indeed, practical problem solving is the mantra of leaders ofboth parties who expect statehouses to remain at the fore-front of major national policy innovations. POLITICS Colorado's Bill Ritter (D) is one of 11 new faces among the 36 governors elected in November.

Janet Napolitano (D),chair of the National Governors Association (NGA), told apost-election gathering for freshman governors at theGreenbrier resort in West Virginia.The governors have moved to position themselves as bipar-tisan brokers with Congress on such federal-state issues asimmigration, Medicaid spending and energy. \"When gover-nors speak in one voice, it has a significant impact,\" NGAVice Chairman Tim Pawlenty, Minnesota's Republican gov-ernor, told Stateline.org.But state leaders aren't waiting for Congress to take the leadon problems such as the nation's broken health care systemand global warming.\"Voters wanted results. They wanted people who can reachacross party lines, who can work in a bipartisan fashion andget things done,\" said Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, aDemocrat who won re-election with 58 percent of the votein a state where less than a third of voters are registeredDemocrats. Her ticket featured a Republican who switchedparties to run as her lieutenant governor.Eleven new faces were among the 20 Democrats and 16Republicans elected in November. Three are former stateattorneys general. New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer (D) succeed-ed Republican George Pataki, a potential 2008 presidentialcontender who voluntarily stepped down after 12 years inoffice. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist became the first Republicansince Reconstruction to succeed another GOP governor in Tallahassee - the popular, term-limited Jeb Bush. AndDemocrat Mike Beebe took over as Arkansas governor fromRepublican Mike Huckabee, another possible presidentialhopeful.Three new governors are former congressmen: Democrat TedStrickland of Ohio and Republicans C.L. \"Butch\" Otter ofIdaho and Jim Gibbons of Nevada. Six others who hadserved in Congress lost gubernatorial bids in Colorado,Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. In addition to Palin in Alaska, Ritter in Colorado and Patrickin Massachusetts, the other new governors are DemocratsChet Culver in Iowa and Martin O'Malley in Maryland.Ritter previously was a Denver prosecutor, Culver was Iowasecretary of state. Palin was mayor of tiny Wasilla, Alaska,and O'Malley was mayor of Baltimore. Patrick, who servedin President Bill Clinton's Justice Department, was an exec-utive with the Coca-Cola Co. Post-Election State-Federal Relations Last year's midterm election was a watershed for statesbecause it cleared the way for a new beginning in state-fed-eral relations.

Ed Rendell (D), who handily won re-election over Republican Lynn Swann, a Hall-of-Fame profootball player.States have a long political wish list requiring congression-al action. Among other things, they want more time andmoney to comply with the federal Real ID Act of 2005,which was passed to keep driver's licenses out of terrorists'hands and make it harder for illegal immigrants to get state-issued identification. Unless federal relief is forthcoming,states foresee nightmarish lines at motor vehicle depart-ments and costs as high as $11 billion.A longer-standing conflict is over the No Child Left BehindAct, Bush's 2002 education initiative, which is up for revi-sion in 2007. States have challenged the costs of testingrequired under the law and its method of determiningwhether schools are making adequate progress.On the energy front, states are in the forefront of efforts todevelop alternative fuels and reduce fossil-fuel emissionsblamed for global warming. California's Schwarzeneggersigned a pact with Great Britain last fall to combat green-house gases and approved the nation's toughest restrictionson smokestack emissions linked to climate change. Othergovernors are promoting greater use of ethanol and newenergy derived from coal. These efforts are likely to intensi-fy now that presumably more environment-friendlyDemocrats are in charge at the U.S. Capitol. \"The message toCongress is that we need each other,\" Iowa's Culver said. Health care is yet another area where stepped-up state poli-cy initiatives are expected. Massachusetts, Vermont andMaine already are moving to see that no state resident isuninsured, and California's Schwarzenegger has said that isone of his top priorities in his second term. The states willbe looking to the federal government for help on programssuch as Medicaid, the health care program for the poor,where federal and state roles intersect. \"Like welfare reformin the 1990s, if Congress gives states flexibility, they'll showthe pathway to a better future,\" Minnesota's Pawlenty said. Government Innovation The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis oncefamously described the states as laboratories of democracy,and in the aftermath of last year's balloting, the states areawash in policy ideas. Florida's Crist, a Republican withGOP majorities in both houses of the Legislature, is pushingto lower property insurance rates for Florida homeowners.Cutting property taxes and curbing the state's climbing mur-der rate are other issues atop Crist's agenda.Colorado's Ritter intends to focus on making higher educa-tion more affordable and health care more accessible, butPOLITICS Governors 1980 to 2006 State legislators 149Lieutenant governors 56U.S. representatives 28Attorneys general 24Mayors 19Secretaries of 11County council members 8State auditors 6U.S. senators 4Offices formerly held by governors Source: National Lieutenant Governors Association 2007 Governors' Elections Ky.La.Miss.Ernie of state Web sitesState Governor Primary General The National Governors Association hosts a post-election orientation session in West Virginia for these first-time governors:Jim Gibbons (R) of Nevada, Deval Patrick (D) of Massachusetts, Bill Ritter (D) of Colorado, C.L. \"Butch\" Otter (R) of Idaho, Mike Beebe (D) of Arkansas and Ted Strickland (D) of Ohio.

Jennifer Granholm (D) willhave a Democratic-controlled state House to work with in2007. Her party won a majority in that chamber for the firsttime since 1994. In a state struggling with job losses in theslumping U.S. auto industry, she has proposed a $1 billionplan to cover 500,000 of the more than one million residentswithout health insurance. She also signaled she will use hernew political footing to try to overturn the state's ban onembryonic stem cell research.Maryland's O'Malley said that government performancemay sound \"ho-hum\" but that a responsive and accountablegovernment is crucial \"to making government work.\" Heplans to replicate a government-performance program called\"CitiStat\" that he piloted as mayor of Baltimore and that in2004 won an \"Innovations in American GovernmentAward\" from the John F. Kennedy School of Government atHarvard.The states are in their best fiscal shape since 2000, provid-ing a window of opportunity for new initiatives. However,the costs of state employee pensions, health care for theuninsured, demands for more education spending and theneed to repair crumbling roads and bridges loom on thehorizon.There is also a worry that federal policy-makers will try toease their deficit headaches at state expense. Less than amonth after the November elections, the National GovernorsAssociation sent a letter urging the White House's Office ofManagement and Budget to \"avoid proposals that simplyresult in savings for the federal government.\"Looming over all of the policy decisions is the 2008 presi-dential race, the first in more than a half-century without anincumbent president or vice president seeking the office.Historically, the party with more governors has an advan-tage. When Bill Clinton was first elected president in 1992,for example, Democrats held 27 governorships. George W.Bush captured the White House in 2000, when Republicangovernors were in charge in 31 states. Ritter's victory in the Colorado gubernatorial race couldhave significance for presidential politics if it heralds areshaping of allegiances in the Rocky Mountain states.Democratic governors now preside in five of eight mountainstates - all carried by Bush in 2004 and all but New Mexicoin his column in 2000. The Democratic governors ofArizona, Colorado, Montana and New Mexico helped founda new political organization just after the election to exploitDemocratic gains in the region.The current 28-22 split in favor of the Democrats couldchange later this year, when governors in Kentucky,Louisiana and Mississippi face re-election.

Ballot Measures The voters were asked to set state policy by saying yea ornay to 204 proposals on the ballot in 37 states on Nov. 7. Thefour most newsworthy results came in Arizona, whichbecame the first state to reject a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage (seven other states joined the 20 that alreadyhad constitutional bans); in Missouri, which approved pro-tections for embryonic stem cell research; in South Dakota,where voters threw out the nation's most stringent anti-abor-tion law; and in Michigan, which approved a ban on theracial preferences in college admissions and governmenthiring known as affirmative action.Minimum wage increases were approved in all six stateswhere they were on the ballot - Arizona, Colorado,Missouri, Montana, Nevada and Ohio. That brought to 29the number of states with a minimum wage higher than the$5.15-an-hour federal rate set by Congress 10 years ago.Anti-tax advocates failed to convince voters in Maine,Nebraska and Oregon to impose caps on state governmentspending. Eight states restricted government power to seizeprivate property under the doctrine of eminent domain.That action came in reaction to a 2005 U.S. Supreme Courtdecision that allowed a Connecticut town to raze homes tomake way for a shopping center. Political partisans increasingly have tried to use ballot meas-ures to spur turnout at the polls. But voters may be gettingleery of initiatives placed on the ballot by citizens' groups.Only a third of citizen initiatives won approval in 2006,compared with nearly a 50 percent approval rate between1990 and 2004, according to the National Conference ofState Legislatures. Meanwhile, voters approved 86 percentof measures put on ballots by legislatures.

Prah Statehouses awash in surpluses ventured into new projects in 2006, from first-in-the-nation preschool for all 3-year-olds in Illinois to a space pad in New Mexico. States also made strides on issues that stymied Congress, including health care, immigra- tion, the minimum wage and global warming. Most in vogue in the 44 states that held regular leg- islative sessions were measures to hike the mini- mum wage, condone use of deadly force in self- defense and restrict local government's power to condemn private property. Legislatures in more than half the states also hustled through a ban on anti-gay picketers stalking U.S. soldiers' funerals. But some of the headlines from state capitols didn't center on policy-making. In an election year that heightened the usual partisan tensions, ethics issues were raised about gov- ernors in Illinois, Kentucky and Wisconsin, and the FBI raided legislative offices in Juneau, Alaska. All but a few states faced the happy dilemma of how to spend unexpected sums of money as a healthier U.S. econ- omy pumped up revenues to their highest level in six years. Utah, Washington state and Wyoming grappled with project- ed surpluses of at least $1 billion. With extra money in their coffers: Florida slashed taxes by nearly $300 million. Illinois spent $135 million to create the nation's first statewide preschool program for both 3- and 4-year-olds. Minnesota approved measures to build a $522 million baseball stadium for the Minnesota Twins and a $248 mil- lion football stadium for the University of Minnesota. New Mexico earmarked $762 million for construction projects, including $100 million to build a commercial spaceport that one day could offer space tourism. New York agreed to nearly $1 billion in grants and tax breaks for a computer chip manufacturing plant in the northeastern part of the state. Wyoming cut $100 million in taxes by eliminating the sales tax on groceries and approved $2.1 billion in new education funding - a 24 percent increase that could boost it to first or second in the nation in per-pupil spending. Where Congress Gridlocked While Congress failed to raise the minimum wage above the $5.15 hourly rate set in 1997, 11 legislatures and voters in six states in 2006 boosted wage floors above the federal min- imum. Twenty-nine states now require businesses to pay workers more than $5.15 an hour. The new Democratic lead- ership in Congress has pledged to raise the minimum wage in the rest of the country. (See MINIMUM WAGE, Page 38) With the number of Americans without health insurance nearing 47 million, states also took groundbreaking steps to address the nation's broken health care system. Moving toward universal coverage, Massachusetts became the first state to require residents to buy insurance and threatened companies with fines of $295 for each worker notPOLITICS Arizona Gov.

Vermont followed with a plan requiring private insurers to offer health coverage for primary and pre- ventive care under the oversight of a state commission. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) vetoed what would have been the nation's first publicly financed univer- sal health care system but vowed to make covering the unin- sured a major priority in his second term. In a state-led backlash to illegal immigration, 33 states enact- ed a record 78 immigration-related laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Arizona, Colorado and Georgia passed the toughest measures while Congress shelved President Bush's proposal to overhaul U.S. immigration policy and instead opted to build a 700- mile fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. Georgia cut off illegal immigrants' access to public services and will impose strict sanctions on employers who hire ille- gal aliens in 2008. In a special session on immigration, Colorado legislators voted to require proof of residency for state services and to target employers who hire illegal aliens. Colorado voters approved two additional anti-immigration measures on Election Day. In Arizona, which sees the largest volume of illegal cross- ings from Mexico, Gov. Janet Napolitano (D) vetoed a host of anti-immigration bills. But the Republican-controlled Legislature retaliated by placing four measures on the November ballot; all were approved. The most controversial builds on a 2004 voter-approved law cutting off state social services for illegal aliens, additionally barring day-care funding and in-state college tuition. Nebraska lawmakers, however, went the other direction and, over the objections of Gov. Dave Heineman (R), became the 10th state to allow illegal immigrants to pay in-state college tuition rates. (See IMMIGRATION, Page 39) On the environment, California took the nation's lead in fighting global warming with a plan to force industries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, 25 per- cent by 2020. Seven Northeastern states also have a pact to curb pollutants blamed for global warming, aiming to cut power-plant emissions 10 percent by 2019. The Bush administration has resisted mandatory reductions of gases blamed for climate change. Abortion, Gay Marriage Abortion and gay marriage attracted controversy in several legislatures, but voters had the final say. South Dakota lawmakers touched off a national tempest by passing a strict abortion ban aimed at setting up a legal chal- lenge to Roe v. Wade , the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion. South Dakota voters, however, threw out the law, which would have made it a felony to help a woman end her pregnancy, except to save her life. In California and Oregon, voters rejected abortion measures similar to those on the books in 35 states requiring parents to be involved if a minor seeks an abortion. For the first time, a state also rejected a ballot initiative to ban same-sex marriage. Arizona voters refused to add a pro- hibition against gay marriage to their state constitution, even as seven other states- for a total of 27 nationwide - adopted constitutional bans on Election Day. New Jersey lawmakers in December adopted civil unions as an alternative to same-sex marriage. The action was a quick response to an Oct. 25 state Supreme Court order to provide equal legal rights for gay couples, either through civil unions as in Vermont and Connecticut or through same-sex mar- riage as in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, the only state where same-sex weddings now are permitted, outgoing Gov. Mitt Romney (R) in November asked the state's highest court to intervene to force the Legislature to put a gay marriage ban on the 2008 ballot. Lawmakers had used parliamentary maneuvers to avoid putting the ban to a statewide vote.

Ten states enacted another pro-gun law, inspired by the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, that bars law enforcers from confiscating weapons during declared emergencies or natural disasters. (See SELF-DEFENSE LAWS, Page 43) News of sensitive personal data being lost or stolen led Delaware, Iowa and Maryland to create \"identity theft pass- port programs\" to help consumers whose credit cards andother information were stolen and used illegally. In addi- tion, at least 15 states enacted laws allowing consumers to put security freezes on their credit reports, bringing to 26 the total of states with laws to prevent credit-reporting compa- nies from releasing information without consumers' con- sent, according to NCSL. In first-of-its-kind legislation, California took steps to protect children in foster care from having their identities purloined by con artists using the youngsters' names to take out credit and phone cards. While the housing market may have cooled, the decade's spike in real estate values added to the sting of property tax bills. Arizona, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island responded by cutting property taxes. A few others swapped lower property taxes for increases in sales or other state taxes. A \"property tax swap\" was the solution to a six-day shut- down of New Jersey state government last July. The nation watched the drama as Gov. Jon S. Corzine (D), in his first year after quitting the U.S. Senate, shuttered Atlantic City casinos, closed state parks and furloughed 45,000 state employees as legislators argued over how to balance the budget and cut property taxes, the highest in the country. Corzine secured a 1 percent sales tax increase, with half the new revenue earmarked for property relief.

New laws in Georgia and Missouri requiring voters to show a govern- ment-issued photo ID were struck down before Election Day. But the U.S. Supreme Court intervened a week before the election to reinstate Arizona's 2004 voter-approved ID requirements. And Indiana piloted its 2005 law - the tough- est in the country - requiring voters to show a government- issued photo ID with their address and signature. Precedents and Popular Policy In other significant 2006 developments: Thirty-one states - by legislation or ballot measures - sharply limited government's powers to take private land through eminent domain for economic development, according to NCSL. States were reacting to a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that let a Connecticut town raze homes to build a shopping center. Ironically, Connecticut created an eminent domain ombudsman, but failed to enact sweeping legislation. (See PROPERTY RIGHTS, Page 42) Indiana raised $3.8 billion for new road projects by leas- ing its 157-mile state-run Indiana Toll Road to a Spanish- Australian consortium. (See Page 14) Illinois lawmakers cleared the way for Chicago to lease downtown Midway Airport to private investors. Hawaii dumped the nation's only cap on wholesale gaso- line prices, eight months after the Legislature's futile attempt to control price spikes spawned by the Gulf Coast hurricanes. North Carolina created the country's first judicial panel to investigate credible claims of innocence by convicted felons, with the possibility of overturning convictions. Maryland's General Assembly, in a move aimed at Wal- Mart, overrode Republican Gov. Robert Ehrlich's veto to enact the first state law to require large employers to bol- ster employee health benefits, but a federal court over- turned it. Alaska re-criminalized marijuana, but the measure faces legal challenge. Georgia let public schools offer courses on the Bible, while South Carolina said its schools could offer credit for religious courses taken off campus. Maine banned the sale of wireless phone records after Internet brokers in several states violated privacy stan- dards. Nebraska divided Omaha's largest public school district into what critics say are three new, racially distinct dis- tricts that revive the specter of segregated schools. West Virginia's new underground coal mine safety law, enacted soon after the Sago Mine explosion that killed 12 miners, served as the blueprint for federal legislation that President Bush signed June 15. Connecticut will require new cars by 2009 to have labels showing their greenhouse gas \"scores\" based on federal ratings on environmental friendliness. Motorists will pay an additional $5 registration fee. A free-speech legal case is springing out of laws passed by 27 states, according to NCSL, to ban anti-gay picketers at memorial services for U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. The protesters, primarily from a Topeka, Kan., church, say the deaths of U.S. troops are God's wrath for the country's sanctioning of homosexuality. Post-Katrina Action The nation got a break from Mother Nature. No hurricanes struck the United States in 2006, but the Gulf Coast still was recovering from devastating Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Louisiana devoted a special session to storm recovery. Gov. Kathleen Blanco (D) pushed through a measure merging southeast Louisiana's hodgepodge network of levee boards into two boards, one for each bank of the Mississippi River, and won permission to streamline the government of New Orleans. In response to the death of thousands of pets after Katrina, the state ordered creation of a unique identification system so pets and owners can be reunited after emergencies. Louisiana voters weighed in, too, amending the state consti- tution to devote any increase in federal royalty payments from offshore oil drilling to post-Katrina coastal restoration and levee projects. The Mississippi Legislature continued Katrina recovery efforts by rebuilding public utilities, offering grants to home- owners and cracking down on home-repair fraud.

Election-Year Ethics Ethical issues heightened the drama in state capitals. In Alaska, the FBI raided the Juneau offices of several legisla- tors, looking for ties to a large oil-field services company. Kentucky Gov. Ernie Fletcher (R), who faces re-election this year, was indicted last May on state misdemeanor charges over hiring practices. Attorney General Greg Stumbo (D) dis- missed the charges three months later, but continued a probe of Fletcher's administration. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich (D) won his re-election bid in 2006 despite being dogged by federal and state corruption probes of his administration. Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle (D) likewise won, after a state ethics board cleared him and a former deputy of allegations they helped a major campaign donor get state work. In Tennessee, Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) called a special session last January on ethics reform, a response to the \"Tennessee Waltz\" sting operation that resulted in the conviction of two former legislators for taking bribes from government agents posing as lobbyists. Three more current and former lawmak- ers were awaiting trial. The special session yielded a new law that limits cash contributions, prohibits lobbyists from giving to campaigns, and strengthens requirements for lob- byist disclosures. Pennsylvania in November finally shed its distinction as the only state not to require lobbyists to report how much they spend wooing state lawmakers. North Carolina lawmakers enacted the biggest changes to ethics and lobbying rules in 30 years by denying themselves unlimited access to campaign contributions, gifts and other perks from lobbyists. In particular, the University of North Carolina, home of the Tar Heels, was barred from giving ath- letic tickets to legislators or officials working for the governor.Notable Inaction The year also will be remembered for some things states didn't do. In California, Schwarzenegger sought to overhaul the state's overcrowded prison system during a special session, but came away empty-handed. Alaska Gov. Frank Murkowski (R), defeated in the Republican primary, failed to push through a deal he nego- tiated with major oil companies to build a $25 billion gas pipeline through Canada. The Alaska Supreme Court ruled in late November that Murkowski could not sign the con- tract without approval from the Legislature.

Prah Want to buy the Brooklyn Bridge? It's not for sale yet, but the Indiana Toll Road and the Pocahontas Parkway outside Richmond, Va., recently were leased to the highest bidders. And if Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) prevails, private firms will pay the Lone Star State $1.2 billion for the right to build a $6 billion toll road from San Antonio to Dallas. It's the latest twist in creative ways of generating revenueswithout raising taxes. States have taken to selling off, leas-ing out and cashing in on some of their most valuable assets, primarily toll roads. Several big deals were consummated in 2006, even as aresurgent economy and the return of surpluses gave moststates a respite from penny-pinching. Another form of easymoney - tax revenues from legalized gambling - also ishelping to keep state coffers brimming. And states, like cred-it card-crazed shoppers, are borrowing more money thanever through the bond markets.The prize of cash upfront is what's driving the new phenom-enon of states marketing public assets to private corpora-tions. \"Policy-makers are asking themselves, 'What assets can welease?'\" said Arturo P\u00e9rez, a fiscal expert at the NationalConference of State Legislatures. \"A lot of creative minds areout there working on that.\" Govs. Rod Blagojevich (D) of Illinois and Matt Blunt (R) ofMissouri are looking into auctioning off student loan portfo-lios. The governors of Illinois and Indiana also are bothpushing to lease their state lotteries for billions of dollars,promising the money will be spent on schools. Indiana's $3.8 billion deal for a 75-year lease on its toll roadmade other states take notice. The arrangement with a pri-vate Australian-Spanish consortium gives the state a way topay for $3 billion in transportation upgrades across Indianaover the next 10 years. The companies also agreed to make$400 million in repairs to the 157-mile toll road, which runsacross northern Indiana from Illinois to Ohio. Plus, the statewill net $700 million to $900 million in interest on the $3.8billion lump-sum payment. Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels (R) figures the deal will triggerthe biggest infrastructure building program in state history,create 130,000 new jobs and ultimately benefit the state tothe tune of $4.5 billion. That's a far cry from the losses the50-year-old toll road chalked up for the state in five of thelast seven years, Daniels said.But Daniels' deal didn't sit well with some Hoosiers. He hadto twist arms to narrowly win the Legislature's approval,even though both houses then were under GOP control, andthe controversy helped Democrats take over the IndianaHouse in last year's elections. Despite the hard sell and political fallout, Danielsannounced he also will seek a private partner to build a $1billion, 75-mile toll bypass around Indianapolis. TAX AND BUDGET Workers cross theBrooklyn Bridge toManhattan on awinter morning. Christopher Connell56455_Txt 12/21/06 10:46 AM Page 14 15 While state finances are the healthiest they've been in sixyears, many state transportation budgets are lagging farbehind the demand for repairs and improvements.Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada andPennsylvania face roadwork to-do lists of more than a bil-lion dollars over several years.It didn't help when gasoline prices skyrocketed in midyear.Motorists curbed their driving, cutting into the per-gallongas taxes that finance most road improvements. Taxpayersgroaning at $50 fill-ups were in no mood for gas tax increas-es. \"Leasing assets is a politically more palatable option,\"says Sujit CanagaRetna, a Council of State Governments fis-cal analyst. Virginia agreed to lease the Pocahontas Parkway, outsideRichmond, for 99 years to a private Australian firm calledTransurban after a nonprofit agency running the nine-mileroad went belly up. Transurban paid $522 million, plusagreed to build a 1.6-mile connector to the Richmond airport. The deal generated little controversy becauseVirginia laws already sanction public-private partnerships.Traffic tie-ups are a big issue in booming northern Virginia,but lawmakers in Richmond have resisted raising taxes toalleviate the congestion. A special session called by fresh-man Gov. Tim Kaine (D) last year failed to untie the knot.Kaine predicts public-private partnerships could address upto 20 percent of the state's long-term highway needs. Oneproposal is to lease a state-operated toll road linking suburbsaround Dulles International Airport to highways intoWashington, D.C., for upwards of $6 billion.In the Southwest, all eyes are on Texas as newly re-electedGov. Perry pushes his \"Trans-Texas Corridor,\" a swath of tollroads, railways and pipelines that would cost $183 billion tobuild over half a century. Three of Perry's gubernatorial opponents lambasted the first phase of the plan, in which aconsortium of foreign firms has agreed to pay the state $1.2billion and spend $6 billion constructing a 300-mile tollroad between Dallas and San Antonio. (The deal is pendinguntil environmental studies are complete.)Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D) in December asked pri-vate companies to make their best offers to buy or lease thePennsylvania Turnpike, which links Philadelphia toPittsburgh and was dubbed \"America's first superhighway\"when it opened in 1940. New Jersey also is considering leas-ing parts of its turnpike.Pennsylvania also is weighing whether to turn to privatefirms to expand heavily traveled Route 322, the road to StateCollege, while New Jersey is mulling a sale or lease of the173-mile Garden State Parkway and its 11 toll plazas, as wellas the 47-mile Atlantic City Expressway from thePhiladelphia suburbs.Critics argue that private firms are apt to jack up tolls andfees because they have to keep investors, not voters, happy.Others worry that states will fritter away the upfront money.\"I'm mistrustful of something-for-nothing schemes, and,conceptually, these plans have a whiff of that,\" said NickJohnson, a state budget expert for the Center for Budget andPolicy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C.President Bush persuaded Congress in 2005 as part of thetransportation bill to make it easier for states to issue tax-exempt bonds for public-private road and bridge projects.Many states still are trying to recover from a borrowing bingeearlier this decade. State and local governments owed near-ly $1.9 trillion in 2005 from bond issues, up sharply from $1 trillion in debt outstanding in 2000. Lower debt meansbetter ratings and terms from Wall Street and bondholders.An easier way for states to bring in cash is to let folks lose iton lottery tickets or at the roulette table - and take a fat cut. TAX AND BUDGET Reserve BoardState and local governments have accumulated $1.85 trillion in combined debt, up 852 percent from the $194.8 billion combined debt they had in 1975.State and Local Government Debt Since 1975 Slot machines sparkled inside the Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downsin Plains Township, Pa., on the eve of opening day in November. 56455_Txt 12/21/06 10:46 AM Page 15 16 All but Hawaii and Utah have legalized some form of gam-bling, and experts foresee no letup in governments' thirst forgaming dollars. Commercial gambling, excluding AmericanIndian casinos, brought in nearly $5 billion in gaming taxesto state and local governments in 2005. That was in additionto $16 billion in profits from state lotteries, and more than $1billion in fees garnered from casinos on Indian reservations. Arkansas voters just legalized bingo. And the first slotmachines recently were installed at racetracks inPennsylvania and Florida, which join nine other states with\"racinos.\" Pennsylvania is on the verge of becoming the nation'sbiggest slots state behind Nevada (not counting AmericanIndian casinos). The first slots parlor in the Quaker Stateopened at a horse track in the state's northeast corner.Eventually Pennsylvania plans to have 61,000 one-armedbandits at 14 venues, raising concerns from nearbyDelaware, New Jersey, New York and West Virginia that alsorely on gaming dollars. In Mississippi, casinos along the Gulf Coast still may looklike riverboats, but they now sit on dry land. Recovery legis-lation after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 allowed casinos torebuild 800 feet from the water's edge. Nine of the dozencasinos destroyed around Gulfport were back in business bylast fall.Indian gaming grew more than three times as fast as thecommercial gaming industry in 2005, and \"more states aretrying to get a cut,\" says Alan Meister, an economist who fol-lows the industry for the Analysis Group, a financial strate-gy and consulting business. While states cannot tax profits from Indian gaming, theyaccrue serious money from compacts negotiated with tribes.In the 30 states with tribal casinos, state and local govern-ments got more than $1 billion from fees and revenue-shar-ing agreements in 2005, according to Meister's most recentfigures. That's a 20 percent increase from the previous year.California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) has signed 20deals with American Indian tribes since he took office in2003, but only 10 have won approval from the Legislature.Still pending is a deal Schwarzenegger negotiated with theAgua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians that could yield thestate $1.8 billion through 2030, including nearly $60 milliona year from 3,000 new slot machines.Three other Southern California tribes want agreementsmodeled on that deal to install 11,000 more slot machines.Democrats, who control the Legislature, objected, arguingthese tribal-state agreements leave unionized hotel and casi-no workers out in the cold. A move by the U.S. Congress to ban Internet gambling maywind up boosting state lottery profits. The new federal lawbans Internet gambling through offshore sites but allows statesto operate lotteries online, noted Keith Whyte, executivedirector of the National Council on Problem Gambling. Heexpects state lotteries to aggressively use the latest technologyto tap into the estimated $12 billion gamblers spend online. Still, the appetite for more gaming is not uniform. In lastyear's election, Ohio and Nebraska voters rejected ballotmeasures to expand video keno and slot machines, andRhode Island voters rejected the Narragansett Indian Tribe'sbid to open a $1 billion casino in West Warwick. On theother hand, Arkansas voted to let charities hold bingogames, and in South Dakota, residents chose to keep thestate's video lottery legal. States were awash in money in 2006, but many are \"appre-hensive about the surge of expenditures down the road,\"says CanagaRetna of the Council of State Governments. As many as 20 states project deficits for fiscal 2008, whichbegins in July for all but four states. State treasuries got abreak when Medicaid health care costs rose just 2.8 percentin 2006, the smallest increase in a decade. But no onebelieves the era of rampant health inflation is over.On top of higher medical bills for the poor, states are underpressure to spend more on schools. That is particularly truefor the nearly two dozen states battling lawsuits alleging thattheir school budgets are inadequate.Also problematic are future health and pension benefits forretiring state employees that experts estimate could cost $1trillion. States also are worried about the $11 billion theysay it will cost to revamp the issuance of driver's licenses tocomply with new federal anti-terrorism rules.

Vock Massachusetts has accomplished the improbable: It got Democrats and Republicans to agree on how to provide nearly every resident with health insurance. And it did so without boosting taxes or pushing aside private health plans. Spearheaded by outgoing Gov. Mitt Romney (R), the com-promise marks a marriage of competing visions forhealth care reform shaping state policies around the nation. Democrats stress the need to move toward health cov-erage for all. Republicans promote putting consumers in con-trol. What Massachusetts did was to fuse these philosophies.While Massachusetts is hailed as a trailblazer, even stateswith less ambitious goals are setting out to repair the coun-try's broken health care system. The changes go beyond tax-payer-funded Medicaid programs for the poor and disabled.States are expanding medical coverage for the working unin-sured, rewarding patients who develop healthy habits andprodding private industry to offer greater health benefits.States feel the brunt of spiraling medical costs in their bot-tom line. Plus, there's powerful political pressure for statesto address the problem of the uninsured. The Census Bureaufound that nearly 47 million Americans - one in six - wentwithout health insurance in 2005. When it began keepingtrack in 1987, 31 million Americans - fewer than one ineight - lacked coverage. Massachusetts' new policy aims to cover 460,000 uninsuredresidents by July. Some 106,000 are already eligible forMedicaid care but weren't enrolled. Another 150,000 willget help buying a private health insurance policy, subsidizedby a portion of the $1 billion the state now uses to reimbursehospitals for charity care.The remaining 204,000 must buy private insurance throughtheir employers or through a new state agency. That groupincludes many uninsured workers who consider privatecoverage too expensive or who are young, healthy and will-ing to risk going without. They will face tax penalties if theydon't buy a policy: loss of their personal exemption, and by2008, a penalty equal to half of what health insurance pre-miums would have cost. Employers who don't providehealth insurance will face annual penalties, too - $295 perworker.A new state agency - the Commonwealth Care HealthInsurance Connector - will create a market for private insur-ers to compete for the new customers and offer benefits otherwise tough to find. For example, a seasonal workercould keep the same plan all year, even if he's working fortwo different employers, building houses in summer andplowing roads in winter. Workers using the Connector can pay for coverage with pre-tax dollars, giving them the same tax benefits as workerswith employer-provided insurance.\"I think one of the things that came out of Massachusetts,which is in the air in many state capitols and hopefully herein Washington (D.C.), is the incredible sense of compromisethat they were able to pull off,\" said Alice Burton, directorof the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's State CoverageInitiatives. HEALTH CARE At a Boston clinic, then-Gov. Mitt Romney (R) of Massachusettscongratulates Madeline state-subsidizedhealth plan. 18 56455_Txt 12/21/06 10:46 AM Page 18 19 At a signing ceremony in Boston's historic Faneuil Hall lastApril, Romney called the result a once-in-a-generation featachieved \"without a government takeover and without rais-ing taxes.\" The former businessman, who is mulling a WhiteHouse bid in 2008, hopes the Bay State's health care planwill be a signature issue.Of course, it could fall apart when Massachusetts residentswho are voluntarily uninsured are forced to buy coverage orface tax penalties. It would not be the first health-carereform attempt to backfire. In 1988, Michael Dukakis, thengovernor of Massachusetts and a Democratic candidate forpresident, signed a \"play or pay\" law that required compa-nies with six or more workers to offer health insurance orpay a $1,680 tax for every worker. But after he lost, lawmak-ers in Boston repealed the mandate before it took effect.The task of covering the uninsured is easier inMassachusetts than in most other states. Its 10.7 percentuninsured rate already is one of the lowest in the country.But other states are trying to close the gap, too. Soon afterMassachusetts adopted its plan, Vermont's Republican Gov.Jim Douglas and the Democratic majority in the Legislaturetook similar action. The Vermont approach shares many elements withMassachusetts' reforms: premium assistance for the workinguninsured, enhanced Medicaid benefits and an opportunityfor all residents to buy insurance through the state, at premi-ums ranging from $60 to $135 a month. It also penalizesbusinesses that don't offer health insurance.Vermont hopes to cut costs by encouraging diabetics andheart patients to keep up with treatment. And it wants toallow HMOs to give discounts to policyholders who quitsmoking or take steps to address chronic conditions. Maine's Democratic Gov. John Baldacci is rethinking how topay for a year-old program designed to move his statetoward universal coverage. When the Dirigo Health initia-tive was launched in 2005, Baldacci argued that savingsfrom driving down health costs could be used to insuremore residents. But health insurers say he overestimated thesavings. They sued when the state tried to collect $44 mil-lion it claims to have wrung out of the health care system.The court challenge failed, but newly re-elected Baldaccihas agreed to take another look at how to fund the program.Expanding health care coverage is a big issue in many statecapitols: After narrowly winning re-election, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty (R) challenged the Democratic Legislature toextend health benefits to more than 70,000 uninsured chil-dren. He also signaled he was open to a Massachusetts-style mandate that all residents be insured. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) promised to make access to health care a major focus of his secondterm after vetoing a move by the Democratic-controlledLegislature last year to jettison private health insuranceand switch to a government-run health system for all.\"Socialized medicine is not the solution to our state'shealth care problems,\" Schwarzenegger wrote in his vetomessage. Labor unions that supported the state takeover,including the Service Employees International Union andthe California Nurses Association, have vowed to bring theissue before voters in a 2008 ballot initiative ifSchwarzenegger fails to act.HEALTH CARE 1.

Rod Blagojevich (D) rolled out his AllKids initiative, which lets parents buy coverage from the statefor their children, even for illegal immigrant children whoare ineligible for Medicaid. The price depends on the par-ents' income. Blagojevich has stressed that AllKids allowsparents of all incomes whose children have chronic dis-eases to buy coverage that might be unaffordable in theprivate market. Pennsylvania Gov. Edward Rendell (D) convinced his Legislature to adopt a comparable Cover All Kids initiative, and Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle (D) is backing asimilar plan. Democratic Govs. Bill Richardson of NewMexico, Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and ChristineGregoire of Washington state also called for universal coverage of children. Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm (D) is seeking federal approval for her $1 billion plan to use Medicaid funds tohelp Michigan's uninsured buy private health coverage. Despite these efforts, the number of uninsured childrengrew in 2006 for the first time since Congress launched theState Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP) in 1997.The program helps states cover uninsured children living infamilies who earn too much to qualify for traditionalMedicaid. In 2005, more than 8 million children and teensunder 18 were uninsured.But aggressive expansions of health care can have pitfalls.Tennessee built up its Medicaid coverage greatly in 1994.But by 2005, Gov. Phil Bredesen (D) had to cut 170,000enrollees from the TennCare program because of perennialbudget overruns. Bredesen assailed the program as \"tooexpensive, too rigid, too hard to control.\" TennCare had been a model for S-CHIP. It began as anexperiment to help working families who could not affordprivate insurance. The idea was that, by aggressively manag-ing their care, TennCare could cover far more people for thesame dollars spent on Medicaid. But the program coveredthe sickest people, making them more expensive to insure.The program encountered large overruns from the start andgrew to consume a third of Tennessee's budget.After pushing through cuts in TennCare, Bredesen, a formerhealth insurance executive, championed his own CoverTennessee initiative, designed to give working familiesaccess to basic medical services. The voluntary programemphasizes personal responsibility - people get a break onpremiums if they stop smoking or lose weight.The federal government gave a boost to healthy living initia-tives in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. It allows states toincrease benefits for Medicaid clients with healthylifestyles, an emphasis meant to improve both patient'shealth and states' bottom lines. As a result: West Virginia now makes people in a Medicaid pilot program agree to follow such simple rules as showing upfor doctor's appointments and getting their childrenimmunized. If they comply, they qualify for extra benefits,such as mental health services and greater prescriptiondrug coverage. HEALTH CARE 106,000150,000204,000460,000 +Eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid.

For exam-ple, someone who keeps up with treatment for asthma orobesity could earn credits toward dental and vision care. Idaho offers Medicaid recipients a medical savingsaccount. Healthy behavior can earn them money to coversmoking-cessation or weight-loss classes, among otherthings. In a pilot project in two Florida counties, Medicaid bene- ficiaries with healthy habits can earn up to $125 a yeartoward over-the-counter medicines and other medicalsupplies. Florida, in addition, is at the forefront of a drive to makeMedicaid programs work more like private health insur-ance. It requires Medicaid patients in a two-county pilotprogram to pick an insurance package from among compet-ing private plans. The state pays the premiums and eventu-ally plans to pay private insurers more for costly patients,such as the elderly and disabled, than for healthier ones.Three out of five Americans receive health insurancethrough their employer, but that number is slipping. Statesare trying both carrots and sticks to slow the trend.Arizona, Kansas, Montana and West Virginia recently beganoffering tax credits to small businesses that offer insuranceto their employees. Arkansas, New Mexico and Oklahomaoffer small businesses and the uninsured the chance to buydiscounted coverage through the state.On the other hand, in a move aimed at Wal-Mart, theMaryland General Assembly passed legislation last year torequire large employers to contribute certain amountstoward employee health benefits. The Democratic-con-trolled Legislature overrode Republican Gov. Robert EhrlichJr.'s veto, but a federal judge invalidated the so-called \"fairshare\" measure, which had been pushed by organized labor.Hawaii, the only state with an employer mandate, hasrequired most businesses to offer health benefits since 1974.Still, 9 percent of its residents are uninsured. In the past,Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington state passed employ-er mandates only to rescind them before they took effect. HEALTH CARE Q1 - Q3 200 6Medicaid, the federal-state partnership that provides health insurance for the poor, has become a major strain on state and federal budgets. In 2006 an improving economy, cost controls instituted by states and a new prescription drug benefit for Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors, all kept costs down. Still, states owe the federal government more than $6 billion to help pay for the new drug benefit.Total Medicaid Spending 1975 to 2006 Source: US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic AnalysisBetween 1996 and 1997, spending slowed to 3 percent, the smallest growth since 1975.

PROVE IT By Kavan Peterson When Colorado state Sen. Andy McElhany (R) championed adoption of the strictest identification require- ments in the country, his aim was to keep illegal immigrants off state welfare rolls. He didn't anticipate making it harder for his 15-year-old daughter to get a learner's permit. But that's what happened when his wife and daughtershowed up at the Division of Motor Vehicles office inColorado Springs in September. They brought the teen's passport, only to discover DMV had changed the rules and apassport was no longer a sufficient form of identification.\"There's no reason to believe a 15-year-old girl is going to berunning around with a fake passport just to get a driver's per-mit,\" a chagrined McElhany said.Going to the DMV never has been a walk in the park, but it'slikely to get even more difficult as states across the countrybegin to comply with stringent federal identification rulesrequired by the 2005 Real ID Act. Americans by the tens of millions will have to dig out doc-uments such as Social Security cards and birth certificates,or go to the expense of getting new ones, to renew their dri-ver's licenses. Fears of terrorism and the uproar over illegalimmigration are behind the new rules. The Real ID Act is aresponse to the fact that four of the 19 foreign hijackers onSept. 11 had obtained valid U.S. driver's licenses.Worries about voter fraud and the chance that illegal immi-grants are taking advantage of taxpayer-funded public serv-ices also have prompted a surge in stiffer identificationrequirements - from voting booths to Medicaid applications.To weed out the few, all Americans growingly need officialpapers to qualify for some of the perks of citizenship. Colorado ran into legal trouble within months of enactingthe nation's toughest ID standards. New rules requiringproof of both identity and legal U.S. residency left someunable to get a driver's license or state ID card. Without ID,they also were left without access to everything from welfareto winter heating assistance to fishing licenses.A state judge in December temporarily froze the new rules,moving the ID dispute into the courts.

Bill Owens (R) -it was the most far-reaching of a record 78 immigration-relat-ed laws enacted in 33 states in 2006. They ranged fromcrackdowns on employers and human traffickers to restric-tions on social services and in-state college tuition. About 100,000 of Colorado's 4.3 million residents draw stateaid. Some 3,000 immigrants were flagged as possible illegalaliens in the first three months under the state's new IDrequirements, and DMV offices detected 150 fake birth cer-tificates, Colorado Revenue Director M. Michael Cooke toldStateline.org . Only 200 people sought temporary waivers from the require-ment on grounds of illness or disability or because theylacked the required documents, Cooke said. That shows thenew identification requirements \"haven't been overly bur-densome,\" she said. But advocates for the poor said caseworkers were over-whelmed with families requesting social services who needhelp tracking down certified birth certificates. The DenverDepartment of Human Services, which helps poor peopleorder and pay for duplicates of their birth certificates, hadabout twice as many folks seeking help a month after the lawtook effect and expects that number to double again by 2007,according to spokeswoman Sue Cobb.Three people turned away at Colorado's DMV filed a class-action lawsuit and won a temporary suspension of the IDrules in December. The judge found the document require-ments for a driver's license imposed a hardship and mayhave been adopted without proper public comment. TheDMV, enforcing a new state law, required applicants to pro-vide two from a list of 19 acceptable documents.One of the plaintiffs, 70-year-old Leon Hill, became home-less after he was robbed of his identification and moneyshortly after moving to Denver in 2006.

A national uproar over illegalimmigration came to a head last year in Colorado, a non-bor-der state whose immigrant population has nearly quadru-pled since 1990 to about 370,000, with half of those undoc-umented, according to an estimate by the nonprofit PewHispanic Center. Fed up with the federal government'sinability to stop illegal border crossings, the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed a dozen immigration bills in aheated special session in July.Still, even lawmakers who voted for restricting services toillegal immigrants said the tough identity requirements fordriver's licenses may have gone too far. \"We need to sitdown and make sure that we're not blocking services tothose entitled to them and that we're protecting our freedomto live under an efficient and effective government,\"Colorado state Rep.

But state officials are aware andare set to bang on the doors of the new Congress demandingmore time and money to comply.States are throwing up their hands at the requirement thateach driver come in person to motor vehicle offices to renewdriver's licenses starting in May 2008. Everyone will have tobring a set of documents proving his identity and residency,although the exact documents haven't been spelled out yet.The papers will have to be verified by government databas-es that do not yet exist. States also have to create new IDswith anti-counterfeiting security features.By curbing renewals by mail and online, Real ID will forceDMVs to handle 686 million customer transactions face-to-face over five years, instead of the 295 million they wouldhandle anyway, a study by the National GovernorsAssociation, the National Conference of State Legislaturesand the American Association of Motor VehicleAdministrators concluded. DMV staffs would have to bedoubled at a cost of more than $11 billion to take on theextra duties, state officials estimate. \"When lines at the DMV are snaking around the block andthe cost of a driver's license has doubled or tripled, thepoliticians holding the bag won't stay in office very long,\"predicts Lee Tien, an attorney for the Electronic FrontierFoundation, a San Francisco consumer advocacy group thatopposes national ID standards.

An election official stood her ground whiletelevision crews recorded the scene. Sanford voted laterwith a newly issued replacement card.South Carolina is one of 26 states that now require voters topresent some form of identification when they show up atthe polls. Georgia and Missouri passed laws last year torequire government-issued photo IDs at the polls, but courtsstruck them down. The Missouri Supreme Court ruled thatthe state's new voter ID requirements \"impermissiblyinfringe on core voting rights guaranteed by the MissouriConstitution.\" Georgia's law, which required residents with-out a state photo ID to purchase a $20 digital identificationcard to vote, was struck down in federal court. The judgelikened the law to an illegal Jim Crow-era poll tax. A legal challenge is pending against Indiana's voter ID law,considered to be the toughest. It requires a government-issued photo ID with the voter's address and signature.Those without proper identification can cast provisionalballots that are counted only if the voter provides proof ofidentity within 48 hours. In Arizona, stringent ID requirements approved at the ballotbox in 2004 were initially struck down by a federal court.But they were reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court oneweek before the 2006 election. Arizona voters needed eithera government-issued photo ID or two documents showingname and address, such as a utility bill or tax return. The federal government also is starting to require proof ofcitizenship for benefits. For the first time, all 53 millionpoor, elderly and disabled people in state-run Medicaidhealth insurance programs must produce documents prov-ing they were born in the United States or are here legally.Four states - Georgia, Montana, New Hampshire and NewYork - already required Medicaid applicants to prove theircitizenship. The ID rules, which went into effect last July, are targeted atillegal immigrants, who are ineligible for Medicaid. TheCongressional Budget Office estimated the change will saveat least $735 million in taxpayer dollars over a decade.But the new law creates problems for Americans withoutbirth certificates or those who can't find them easily. Evenparents with a child's birth certificate in hand - includingthose whose babies were born in U.S. hospitals, makingthem automatic citizens - must provide separate documen-tation proving legal state residency, such as school or healthrecords. Advocates and state Medicaid administrators worrythe nuisance and cost of securing the right documents coulddiscourage parents from getting their child vaccinated ortreated. The elderly and mentally ill in nursing homes or state insti-tutions are especially liable to slip through the cracks, advo-cates warn. It's common for senior citizens to let driver'slicenses lapse or for Alzheimer's patients to lose track of per-sonal identification, noted Elizabeth Priaulx of the NationalDisability Rights Network.

Meanwhile, she relies on welfare checks and subsidized child care to help raise her 7-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son who has serious emotional disabilities. Henderson is in a small category of college-going welfare recipients who studies have shown are mostlikely to be boosted out of poverty permanently. But new federal welfare rules that took effect in October scaleback support states can offer poor parents like Henderson. Now, the 24-year-old must work at least 20 hours a week inaddition to attending classes and must do her homework oncampus under the watchful of eye of a state supervisor tostay eligible for federal welfare dollars. The new limits on students are part of stricter new rulescalled for by Congress last year to nudge even more welfarerecipients into jobs and off the public dime.A decade after then-President Bill Clinton and newlyempowered congressional Republicans made good on prom-ises \"to end welfare as we know it,\" the nation's bedrocksupport program for the needy is being retooled. The newchanges to welfare - while not as radical as the 1996 reforms- will require most states to revamp their welfare policies orsacrifice federal dollars, starting in 2011.The welfare-to-work reform of 1996 still is hailed as a shin-ing success story. The number of families on welfaredropped from 4.41 million in 1996 to 1.89 million last year,the lowest since 1969. But in reauthorizing the program for another 10 years,Congress directed the Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS) to tighten the reins, in part because of con-cerns that states had become lax in administering the wel-fare block grants known as Temporary Assistance to NeedyFamilies (TANF).WELFARE Nichole Henderson withson Jamear 56455_Txt 12/21/06 10:46 AM Page 27A federal watchdog report found some states counted bedrest, smoking-cessation classes and even massages as waysto fulfill the law's requirement that at least half of all parentson welfare work or attend job preparation programs. The goal of welfare reform was to wean poor families fromdependence by putting a five-year time limit on cash assis-tance. States were charged with helping parents, often sin-gle mothers, pull their lives together and start making endsmeet on their own. To ensure states did enough to help welfare recipients findjobs, the federal government imposed a rule that at least 50percent of single parents and 90 percent of married parentsbe in jobs or work preparation programs.With the aid of a strong economy, states quickly changed theprofile of welfare in America. \"In many ways, TANF is a victim of its own success,\" saidHHS Assistant Secretary Wade Horn, who oversees the pro-gram. Within the first two years, states helped so many peo-ple find jobs, the rolls plummeted and the pressure to meetwork participation rates eased. As a result, some statesbecame \"overly generous\" in their work programs, he said. Horn contends the new rules simply reinforce the dealstruck between Washington, D.C., and the states 10 yearsago. \"States failed to hold up their end of the bargain,\" hesaid. Only 32 percent of families who received cash assis-tance in 2004 fully participated in work preparation pro-grams, according to HHS. Congress has stiffened enforcement of its requirement that atleast 50 percent of welfare parents participate in work pro-grams and called on HHS to define explicitly which activi-ties - such as community service, job training and job searchprograms - qualify, taking away much of states' flexibility todevise their own programs. That flexibility was a hallmarkof the 1996 law.Most affected are programs that help students such asHenderson get college degrees so they can land jobs that payenough to raise their families. In addition to requiring stu-dents to work at least 20 hours a week, the rules limit stu-dents to one year of cash assistance. If it takes longer to geta degree, states wanting to help will have to tap their ownresources.Also endangered are federal funds for parents trying to over-come chronic problems like drug or alcohol addiction, men-tal illness or domestic violence that prevent them fromworking. The new rules require all parents to attend at least 30 hoursa week of work or training programs. Only six weeks ofcounseling or rehab a year now will qualify as work partici-pation. Welfare advocates argue that six weeks is not enoughto help parents turn around their lives and find stable jobs. The new, more exacting rules will be easier for some statesto adjust to than others.

California last year appropriated $90 million toincrease participation in state work programs and set asideadditional money to help parents with disabilities and sub-stance abuse problems outside of the TANF program. Estelle Richman, Pennsylvania's secretary of public welfare,said for now she'll use state dollars to ensure TANF motherssuch as Henderson can keep attending college. But she'sunsure the state can afford the successful project year afteryear without federal support.But as simple a change as better record keeping already hashelped Pennsylvania boost its work rate from 7 percent, thelowest rate in the nation in 2004, to 47 percent last year.Georgia - held up by HHS as a model for new welfare reform- already has lifted its work-participation rate by makingwork rules clear to welfare applicants from the beginningand quickly cutting them off if they fail to attend assignedprograms.In the last two years, the percentage of Georgia's welfarerecipients engaged in work programs rose from 24 percent to64 percent, in part because people who failed to meet therequirements were dropped from the rolls. Instead of moving more people off welfare, Arkansas plansto meet the standards by allowing parents to stay on the rollseven after they land jobs. Statewide research shows thatwithout continued aid, most welfare recipients lose theirjobs and end up back on public assistance within a year.By counting working parents who stay in the program,Arkansas expects to hike its work rate from 28 percent in2004 to nearly 45 percent in 2006.New Hampshire combined the approaches of Georgia andArkansas, passing a law that includes stricter sanctions forthose who fail to comply with state work rules and a pro-gram that allows working parents to stay on welfare untilthey reach a certain income level. Gov. John Lynch (D) signed the law under protest, saying itdid not go far enough to help poor people become self-suffi-cient. To supplement the law, he issued an executive order committing additional funds for child care, transportationand education \"to ensure that TANF clients can truly movefrom welfare to work permanently,\" he said. But not all states have the option of caring for their neediestfamilies without federal support. Some will be hard-pressedto meet the new work-participation rates, predicted JackTweedie, welfare expert with the National Conference ofState Legislatures. Vermont state Rep. Mark Larson (D) said one consequence ofthe new rules is that states will have to come up with moremoney for child care, as more moms work or attend jobpreparation classes. Larson said the new rules effectively will shift more of thecost of caring for the neediest families to state budgets - orelse parents with chronic life problems who are unlikely toattend work programs will go without help. The federal gov-ernment may be able to claim success because TANF rollswill shrink, \"but it won't tell the whole story,\" Larson said.

Where All the Children Are Above Average By Pauline Vu When her son came home from middle school with a report card showing he'd passed North Carolina's year-end algebra test, Margaret Carnes believed he had a solid foundation for high school. Then she met with his teacher, who cautioned her not to be too confident. By the state's yardstick, students could answer fewer than half the questions correctly and still pass. In some grades, they could flub two- thirds of the questions and still be marked \"proficient.\" It can be a harsh wake-up call for children and parentsalike. Students are told they are where they're supposedto be academically, but a rude awakening awaits them in high school. \"It compels one to ask the question, Have theybeen prepared?\" said Carnes, now managing director forCharlotte Advocates for Education, a nonprofit group push-ing for higher state standards. It's a problem of long standing in U.S. public education.While international assessments confirm that American stu-dents lag behind numerous other countries in science andmath, many school districts and states keep telling parentsthat their children, like those in Lake Wobegon, GarrisonKeillor's hometown of fable, are all above average.More testing under the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act wassupposed to help measure whether elementary school chil-dren are learning what they need to know. But scores onstate-generated tests often contradict results on a nationaltest. North Carolina is one of several states with glaring dif-ferences between how well it says its students are doing andthe harsher verdict of independent comparisons.The North Carolina Board of Education finally is getting themessage. It has switched to a tougher math exam, and recent-ly raised the passing scores in math for grades 3 to 8. So farit's one of only a handful of states raising their standards.Welcome to the era of high-stakes testing, where persistent-ly low scores mean principals can get fired and states cantake over failing schools. No Child Left Behind requires U.S.schools to make steady progress, so that by 2014 every stu-dent is proficient in math and reading. But to ensure coop-eration, Congress left it up to each state to measure how wellits pupils were doing. Although the goal was transparency the results have beenmurky. While states report growing percentages of studentsare proficient, the verdict is considerably worse on theNational Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), anexam dubbed \"the nation's report card\" that is given to crosssections of students in all 50 states.The discrepancies in some states are alarming. In Alabama,Colorado, Georgia, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina,Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia, students scored 50percentage points higher on the homegrown tests in 2005than on the NAEP exam. When Tennessee's education department reported a dramat-ic jump in state test scores in 2004-05, the Knoxville News- Sentinel headlined the results, \"Schools meet Bush's chal- lenge.\" But parents belatedly learned there was little causefor celebration. On the federally sponsored exam, only 21percent of Tennessee eighth-graders were up to par in mathand 26 percent in reading, not the 87 percent rated profi-cient on the state tests. EDUCATION Claire Talbott, 7, of San Francisco, reads during a news conference addressing California Standardized Testing.56455_Txt 12/21/06 10:47 AM Page 31MO standards Students rated pro/f_icient by NAEP testing standards Sources : Educatio n Secto r, Educatio n Trust and pro/f_icient NAEP and statewide tests use dierent standards to measure student progress. On the 2005 fourth-grade reading assessments, Mississippi had the largest gap at 71 points, while Missouri had only a two point dierence between NAEP and state results. Graphic by Danny Dougherty - Stateline.org 33 graders as proficient at math, fifth lowest in the country. ButMassachusetts students were the country's highest scorerson NAEP, with 49 percent rated proficient. Students are con-sidered proficient on NAEP if they show competency overchallenging subject matter, including how to apply it to real-world situations. The National Center for Education Statistics, which admin-isters NAEP, plans to release a study in the spring that com-pares states' definitions of proficiency with that of the feder-al test. If some states inflate scores, it comes at a price. Schools thatmask how little their kids are learning behind inflated testscores aren't pushed to provide transfer and tutoring options- the first sanctions under No Child Left Behind. Studentsalso advance through school thinking they have the knowl-edge needed to go to college and get a decent job, only tofind out too late they were never prepared.In California, the university system reported last year that 75percent of high school juniors were not ready for college-level English classes. Nationwide, one-third of studentsentering college need remedial classes. More than a quarterwho enter four-year colleges and almost half of those enter-ing community colleges drop out before their second year.\"There's no doubt that too many kids don't know what theyneed to know to succeed in life,\" said Bethany Little, vicepresident for policy and federal advocacy at the Alliance forExcellent Education, a Washington, D.C.-based research andadvocacy group. The Alliance estimates the nation spends$1.4 billion a year on remediation for unprepared students.As No Child Left Behind comes up for debate and renewalin Congress this year, much of the discussion will focus onthe test gaps, and some prominent conservatives are suggest-ing it's time to embrace national standards or even a nation-al test for all students that would supplant state tests. Everyother major industrialized nation employs a standardizedcurriculum and national tests in its schools.William J. Bennett and Rod Paige, education secretariesunder Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, respectively, exhorted fellow Republicans in a commentaryin The Washington Post to support national standards. The organization most actively pushing for national standards isthe Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank. Tommy Thompson, the Republican former governor ofWisconsin and co-chairman of the No Child Left BehindCommission tasked with proposing changes to the law, saidCongress needs to find a way to stiffen states' spines on test-ing.\"I don't think states have been quite as honest as they shouldbe in regard to their testing and standards,\" he told reportersoutside the commission's September meeting, according tonews accounts.Some states have considered softening standards.Democratic lawmakers in California pushed through a billlast year that would have lowered the state's standards,which they called unrealistically high.

Georgia raised its passing scores at the same time thatit adopted more rigorous standards and new, tougher tests. In November, Minnesota released results from tougher mathand reading tests that debuted in 2006. Statewide, 58 per-cent of students were scored proficient on the math test -down from 76 percent the previous year.In West Virginia, Superintendent of Schools Steve Paine wasonly a week into the job in November 2005 when he got thenews that only 26 percent of fourth-graders were proficienton NAEP math and reading tests, and that eighth-gradersfared even worse. Paine said he couldn't sleep worryingabout the results. On West Virginia's own tests, 70 percent ormore of students scored at grade level. Paine called for an outside audit of the state's standards andtests, and both were found to be lacking. The result: substan-tially tougher standards and new tests starting in 2008. \"I dare say that our standards in little, old West Virginia willprobably be as rigorous and relevant as you'll find anywherein the country,\" Paine told Stateline.org . \"If we're going to do this, we're going to do this the right way, set our stan-dards high and make no concessions.\"The change in North Carolina's end-of-grade tests is the firstsuch adjustment since the tests began in 1993. \"The boardfelt that it was time to increase standards in its efforts to bet-ter prepare students for the rigors of the 21st-century com-petitiveness,\" said Lou Fabrizio, the state's director ofaccountability. The state board ordered tougher passing grades appliedretroactively to tests administered in 2006. Only 66 percentof fourth-graders passed this time, compared with 92 per-cent the year before.That may alarm and frustrate some students and parents, butothers, such as Margaret Carnes, say it's ultimately for thebest.

But what was seen as a more humane alternative to the gas chamber, electric chair, firing squad or gallows now faces serious challenges. The execution in Ohio last May of double-murderer JosephClark is a stark example of why America is taking a hard-er look at lethal injection. Although Ohio had carried out 20 lethal injections withoutincident, prison officials encountered serious problems in exe-cuting Clark, a long-time intravenous drug user convicted ofkilling a service station attendant and a convenience storeclerk. Reporters who witnessed the execution said Clark, 57,raised his head off the gurney and said repeatedly, \"It don'twork. It don't work.\" Prison officials closed the viewing cur-tain as they struggled to find a vein to inject the deadly chem-icals. The procedure took almost 90 minutes. Sparring over lethal injection will resume in courts and legis-latures this year as authorities grapple with tough questionsabout how much pain the condemned feel as they die andwhat role, if any, medical professionals should play in execu-tions.The battle over lethal injection is the latest strand in a long-running debate over the ultimate punishment. The UnitedStates is among a handful of industrialized countries that sanc-tion capital punishment. China, a totalitarian state, remainsthe leader, executing thousands of prisoners annually.Of the more than 3,300 prisoners on death row in the UnitedStates, 53 were executed in 2006, the fewest number since1996, when 45 prisoners were put to death. Texas leads thenation with nearly 380 executions since 1976 and 24 execu-tions in 2006. Recent court rulings have narrowed the grounds for capitalpunishment, and public support generally has slipped. TheU.S. public still favors the death penalty by a 65 percent-to-30percent margin, according to USA Today /Gallup polls over the last three years, but that is down from 80 percent that sup-ported capital punishment in 1994.In the most recent test of public sentiment, Wisconsin votersin November election approved a non-binding ballot measurecalling for restoration of the death penalty in cases whereDNA evidence proves multiple counts of first-degree murder.The result shattered Wisconsin tradition. The Badger State,currently one of a dozen states without the death penalty, lastexecuted criminals in the 1850s. But any attempt by theLegislature to reinstate the death penalty likely would bevetoed by Gov. Jim Doyle (D).The death penalty effectively was put on hold in 12 states lastyear - nine because of questions over lethal injection. Just two weeks before leaving office on Jan. 2, Florida Gov. JebBush (R) suspended all executions until at least March 1while a state commission reviews the state's lethal injectionprocess. Bush formed the commission after the Dec. 13 execu-tion of Angel Diaz, 55, took 34 minutes - twice the normaltime - and required a second dose of lethal drugs because thefirst needle was improperly inserted. In South Dakota, Gov.Mike Rounds (R) last August gave a temporary reprieve toElijah Page, 24, so the state could update its lethal injectionprocedure to include the \"most modern and efficient\" meth-ods. When rescheduled, Paige's execution would be the state'sfirst in 59 years.Maryland's highest court suspended executions in december,ruling the state's lethal injection procedures were improper-ly adopted without public comment.

(Nebraska uses theelectric chair.) State Supreme Courts in Florida andKentucky last fall rejected arguments that lethal injectionswere cruel and unusual punishent and allowed executionsto resume.The three-drug lethal injection process works like this: First,a sedative is administered through an IV, rendering the inmateunconscious, then a paralyzing agent stops the breathing mus-cles and finally a shot of potassium chloride stops the heart.Those challenging the procedure say that if the first chemicalis not properly administered, an inmate may remain con-scious and die an excruciating death from the other twochemicals. Critics contend mistakes are likely, because correc-tional officers, not medical practitioners, administer the fataldose in most states.California's lethal injection process was ruled unconstitu-tionally cruel and unusual in December. U. S. DistrictJudge Jeremy Fogel suspended executions untilthe stateoverhauls its lethal injection procedures. The ruling camein an appeal by Michael Morales, sentenced to die for the1981 rape and murder of a 17-year-old girl. PostponingMorales' execution in february 2006, the judge cited abritish medical lournal report that 21 inmates executed intexas and Virginia had such low levels of anestheticthiopental in their blood that they probably were awakebut unable to move or scream when the fatal potassiumchloride was injected. After four days of hearings and avisit to the execution chamber in san Quentin, Fogel con-cluded it was impossible to determine whether inmatesexecuted in California were unconscious before the fatalshot.More than a dozen states saw similar lawsuite. AMissouri doctor who mixed the three-drug cocktail usedin that state's executions admitted in court he was dyslex-ic and had difficulty readind numbers.Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death PenaltyInformation Center, a nonprofit group that opposes capitalpunishment, said nearly every state uses \"the same protocolthat's raising so many questions, so it's a very important issueaffecting virtually everyone on death row.\"The U.S. Supreme Court hasn't taken any cases that testwhether lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishmentoutlawed by the U.S. Constitution. But it has narrowed useof the death penalty in recent years, banning executions ofthe severely retarded in 2002 and in 2005 prohibiting theexecution of those under age 18 when they committed theircrimes.New York's capital punishment system was struck down bythe state Supreme Court in 2004 on procedural grounds. Itcould be reinstated if the state Assembly rewrites sentencingrules, but lawmakers failed to do so in 2005 and 2006. Death penalty moratoriums also were in effect in Illinois,where a probe of police corruption and racial bias led to thefreeing of a dozen men from death row, and in New Jersey,where a one-year hiatus imposed by Gov. Jon Corzine (D)ended in December. David Elliot, communications director for the NationalCoalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, predicted that debateover capital punishment will see a resurgence in state capitolsthis year.

New Jersey, which hasspent $250 million to prosecute capital cases but has execut-ed no one since restoring the death penalty in 1982, will studyrecommendations of a legislative-appointed commission thatlooked at the death penalty's cost and fairness.More than 15,000 people have been executed in the UnitedStates since colonial days. In 1972, the Supreme Court inval-idated all state death penalty statutes as arbitrary and capri-cious, but four years later it opened the door for states to puttheir death chambers back into use. Even before recent movesto bar executions of juveniles and the severely retarded, thehigh court in 1986 ruled out the death penalty for the insane,and in 1977 it held that rape alone was not a crime punish-able by death. The current court's stance on whether someone can be execut-ed for a crime short of murder could be tested by recent lawsin several states, including Florida, Louisiana, Montana,Oklahoma and South Carolina, authorizing the execution ofrepeat child rapists and molesters. No one yet has been exe-cuted under those laws, but one Louisiana man \u2014 Patrick O.Kennedy \u2014 was sentenced to die in 2003 for raping an 8-year-old girl. His case is being appealed in Louisiana courts.Legislators in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Texas, and even Minnesota, which doesn't have the death penalty, have saidthey will push this year for similar laws.According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 123 menand women in 25 states have been released from death rowsince 1973. The latest was Florida inmate John Ballard in2006. Ballard was convicted of bludgeoning two neighbors todeath, but the Florida Supreme Court said the case againsthim had not been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt. Death penalty critics were pleased when former Virginia Gov. MarkWarner (D), in one of his final acts in 2005, ordered a posthumousreview of DNA evidence in the case of Roger K.

But they've also signaled they will notwait for the federal government to take action on illegalimmigration.A record 78 immigration-control laws were enacted in 33states last year out of 550 immigration bills filed, accordingto the National Conference of State Legislatures. In addition,the backlash against the influx of illegal workers landed theissue on two state ballots and in numerous state campaignsin November. Signs point to more action at the state levelagainst illegal immigration this year.In Texas, whose Legislature didn't meet last year, lawmakersprepared dozens of immigration-related bills for the 2007session that would restrict illegal aliens' access to education,health care and employment. Some of the bills go furtherthan other states' proposals and raise legal issues by target-ing the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants,including seeking to make them ineligible for state employ-ment when they become adults. Texas has the second-largestimmigrant population in the nation, behind California.In Missouri, where several immigration-control measuresfailed last year, lawmakers are expected to consider newproposals to establish English as the state's official language,bar children of illegal immigrants from getting in-state col-lege tuition, and alter state tax codes to go after off-the-booksworkers who don't pay income taxes. After adopting some of the most far-reaching anti-immigra-tion measures last year, including cuts in state services forillegal aliens and penalties for employers who hire them,Georgia lawmakers pre-filed bills last fall again targetingillegal immigrants. One measure would make propertyowned by an illegal immigrant ineligible for any state taxexemption. Georgia, Colorado and Arizona passed the most stringentmeasures against illegal immigrants last year. Colorado wasfirst to enact strict identity requirements that demand proofof legal residency for all state services.Arizona lawmakers put on the ballot and voters approved aseries of measures declaring English the state's official lan-guage and barring illegal immigrants from receiving stateaid, collecting punitive damages in civil suits or making bailif arrested for serious crimes.

Immigration also is roiling local governments. Dozens ofcities and towns are debating whether to follow the exampleof Hazleton, Pa., which in July 2006 adopted an English-only ordinance and harsh penalties for those who employ orrent to illegal aliens. Courts have blocked Hazleton and sev-eral other towns from enforcing such ordinances pendingrulings on their constitutionality. By contrast, Nebraska became the 10th state to grant in-statetuition at public colleges to illegal immigrants, if they grad-uated from state high schools. \u2014Kavan Peterson SAME-SEX MARRIAGE New Jersey took center stage in the battle over same-sex mar-riage at the end of 2006 when state lawmakers quickly legal-ized civil unions to comply with a state Supreme Courtorder to give gay and lesbian couples equal access to therights and privileges of marriage.The Garden State's highest court in October ordered law-makers to either legalize same-sex marriage or provide forequal treatment of same-sex couples in the statute books.State lawmakers opted in December to follow the example ofVermont and Connecticut and create civil unions, an alter-native to marriage. Vermont adopted civil unions in 2000after a legal decision similar to New Jersey's court ruling.Connecticut's Legislature voluntarily adopted civil unionsin 2005.The ruling came just two weeks before the Nov. 7 elections,when seven states adopted constitutional same-sex marriagebans and voters in one state - Arizona - made history bybecoming the first to reject such an amendment. Although largely symbolic, the Arizona vote was hailed bygay rights advocates as a major victory. Voters in 27 stateshave agreed in recent years to add language to their consti-tutions defining marriage as the union of one man and onewoman. Arizona, like 45 other states, already has a statuteon the books banning same-sex marriage. Constitutionalbans are seen as better than statutes at keeping courts fromlegalizing gay marriage. Strategists pro and con predict few state legislatures willconsider constitutional gay marriage bans in 2007 becauseof Democratic gains in the 2006 elections. Of the 23 stateswithout amendments to prohibit same-sex weddings, onlyIndiana and Pennsylvania are likely to see legislative voteson such measures this year, advocates said. A citizen-led ini-tiative is under way in Florida to put a same-sex marriageban on the ballot in 2008.In the only state that legally sanctions gay nuptials -Massachusetts - Democratic legislative leaders used parlia-mentary tactics to keep a same-sex marriage ban off the 2008ballot. A constitutional ban would overturn the 2003 statehigh court ruling that legalized gay marriage. High courts in at least three states - California, Connecticutand Maryland - are expected to rule on same-sex marriagein 2007. Justices in those states heard arguments inDecember 2006. Similar lawsuits are pending in lowercourts in Iowa and Oklahoma. \u2014Kavan Peterson STEM CELLS With a presidential veto standing in the way of more feder-al support for embryonic stem cell research, states will stayon the front lines of the battle over the controversial science.Texas lawmakers are laying the groundwork to join six states - Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, North Dakotaand South Dakota - with laws prohibiting embryonic stemcell research and all forms of human cloning. Legislators inother states, including Missouri and Wisconsin, have pro-posed similar bans. Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm (D) is waging a campaignto remove her state from that list and overturn the state's ban. In November, Missouri voters approved a constitutionalamendment creating a so-called \"safe haven\" for the scienceby ensuring the legality of the research and patients' rightsto receive resulting treatments. Missouri's success is expect-ed to spawn similar measures across the country. Stem cell advocates in Florida, Georgia and Kentuckyalready are campaigning to get the issue on the ballot in2008.Five states - California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland andNew Jersey - have committed state money to embryonic stemcell research, filling a void created when President George W.Bush placed a moratorium on federal funding in 2001.Attempts to appropriate state funding could come up thisyear in Massachusetts, which last year created a safe havenHOT TOPICS56455_Txt 12/21/06 10:47 AM Page 40 41 Alaba m a Alaska Arizon a Arkansas California Co lorado Conn ecticut De law are Florida Ge orgi a Hawaii Idah o Illino is Indian a Iow a Kansa s Kentuc ky Lou isiana Main e Ma ryland ssachu s Michigan Minnesota Mississipp i Missou ri Mon tana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina No rth Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oreg on Penn sylvania Rhod eIsland Sou th Carolina Sou th Daokota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virgi nia Washin g ton West Virg inia Wis co ns in Wyomi ng Totals: 1 3 0 42 27 5 STATESS TATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROHIBITS SAME-SEX MARRIAGESTATE LAW PROHIBITS CIVIL UNIONSPERMITS GAY MARRIAGENO STATE LAW ORPOLICY 1 4 5 6 7 982 6 7 89S T A TE P OL IC I E S O N S A ME - SE X M ARR I AG E 541 2Sig nifies lawalsoprohib its civilun ion partn ership satus forsame -sex coup les. es notban same -sex marr iage, but stipula tes that on ly the legi slatu re, not the courts,can define marriage.

Joe Manchin (D) has proposed eliminat-ing his state's use of imported oil by 2030 and tasked thePublic Energy Authority to come up with a plan. Besidesconservation, new uses for the state's coal reserves are partof Manchin's energy solution, including turning coal intosynthetic diesel fuel. While Midwestern states are pushing corn-based ethanol, analcohol fuel that can be mixed with gasoline, newly electedFlorida Gov. Charlie Crist (R) supports tax credits andresearch funds to use waste from Florida's sugar cane andcitrus crops to make ethanol.Alternative energy is viewed both as a tool for boosting economic development, especially in rural areas, and forfighting global warming, which is linked to the burning offossil fuels such as oil.Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter (D) campaigned on a seven-pointenergy plan that includes working with New Mexico Gov.Bill Richardson and Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, bothDemocrats, on a regional plan to generate clean energy andreduce carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for climatechange.Schweitzer has traveled the country promoting his detailedenergy plan, which focuses on conservation plus alternativefuels and new technologies, including projects that wouldconvert coal to liquid fuel and boost the economy of smalltowns in his state. \u2014Eric Kelderman PROPERTY RIGHTS Less than two years after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed aConnecticut town to raze houses to make way for a shoppingcenter, 34 (31 in 2006 alone) states have expanded protec-tions for property owners and curbed government's powersto condemn private land for economic development.Going even further to protect property rights, Arizonabecame the second state to decree that property ownersshould be compensated when government regulationsdiminish the value of their land. Oregon is the only otherstate to allow payments for so-called \"regulatory takings.\" The movement to roll back government's eminent domainpowers is a backlash against the high court's June 2005 deci-sion in Kelo vs. New London, Conn. Since the Kelo ruling, legislatures in 27 states have enacted laws that either pro-hibit or make it harder for local governments to use eminentdomain to take land for private development, according toLarry Morandi, a land-use expert at the National Conferenceof State Legislatures. In addition, voters in 10 states adoptedballot measures last year that restrict eminent domain,duplicating legislative efforts in three states.Of the 16 states that have not passed any significant eminentdomain legislation since Kelo, Morandi said, the ones likely to raise the issue this year are those that tried, but failed, toget a bill passed in 2006. Mississippi and Virginia both hadsweeping bills that failed to make it out of conference com-mittee by the session's end. Connecticut, the state thattouched off the eminent domain fury, created an eminentdomain ombudsman but has yet to pass strong legislation. \u2014Pauline VuHOT TOPICS Michigan Gov.

The NRA expects so-called \"stand-your-ground\" legislationto be popular in 2007, too. Detractors say the \"shoot-first\"laws make it more likely that confrontations will turn dead-ly and more difficult to prosecute people who commit actsof violence.While it already is legal in most states to use deadly forceagainst an attacker who enters your home, the new self-defense laws allow victims to use deadly force against anattacker in other circumstances if they believe their life isthreatened. The laws grant immunity from criminal prosecu-tion or civil lawsuits for actions taken in self-defense. Besides those 14 states (Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia,Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and South Dakota), 10states adopted another brand of pro-gun legislation last year.Inspired by the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when NewOrleans police went door to door ordering citizens to surren-der their guns, the new laws ban local law enforcers fromconfiscating weapons during declared emergencies or natu-ral disasters.

But retrenchment could be instore for tough new zoning laws that put whole towns offlimits to sex offenders.Laws in California, Georgia and Iowa that bar sex offendersfrom living near schools and parks are being challenged incourt by ex-convicts. But such laws also raise alarms amonglaw enforcers, who worry that sexual predators will be hard-er to track because they have no place to live.A federal judge was to hear a challenge in February toCalifornia's law, adopted by voters in November, which pro-hibits registered sex offenders from living within 2,000 feetof schools or parks. Approved by 70 percent of voters,\"Jessica's law\" would make it impossible for sex offenders tolive in most of Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities.Eighteen other states have similar statewide zoning meas-ures or allow cities to adopt even stricter residency rules tokeep sex offenders from living near schools, day-care cen-ters, parks, churches and bus stops. The rules make it near-ly impossible for sex offenders to find urban housing instates such as Iowa and Georgia, advocates said.Iowa's law, considered one of the toughest in the nation, wasupheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but is beingchallenged in state courts. Georgia's law faces a class actionlawsuit. The plaintiffs in Georgia claim they pose little fur-ther threat to society, including an elderly man withAlzheimer's disease, another living in a hospice who cannotwalk and a woman convicted of having consensual oral sexwith a 15-year-old boy when she was 17.Prosecutors, law enforcers and civil rights groups say thelaws have backfired, resulting in more sex offenders drop-ping off the radar or being pushed to rural areas far fromrehabilitation services and supervision. They also questionhow effective the laws are at protecting children, becausestrangers are responsible for only about 10 percent of sexu-al attack on minors. Lawmakers in at least one state, Kansas, decided againstadopting strict residency restrictions after concluding thatIowa's zoning law had doubled the number of sex offendersunaccounted for since the law took effect. \u2014Kavan PetersonPROPERTY TAX SWAPS Idaho, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas cut propertytaxes in 2006 in exchange for increases in sales or othertaxes, an innovative \"swap\" sure to be on the agenda ofother states this year. Homeowners hate the property tax, typically one of thelargest government debits they pay. Although it's largely alocal tax, state law provides the power to impose it. Propertytaxes pay for a range of local services, including fire andpolice protection, but especially schools. New Jersey put the property-tax swap idea in the nationalspotlight when state politicians last July agreed to end a six-day government shutdown by increasing the Garden Statesales tax by 1 cent, with half designated for property reliefthis year and possibly the full amount in future years. Votersapproved the plan in a Nov. 7 ballot measure.Also on Election Day, Idaho voters approved a property-taxrelief plan adopted by the Legislature in August 2006 thatreduces property taxes by about $260 million by raising thesales tax 1 cent.South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford (R) last summer signed ameasure that promises to cut average property taxes by 60percent and makes up the revenue by bumping up the state'ssales tax 1 cent. Texas took a different tact. As part of a special session torevamp school funding, the state lowered property taxes$15.7 billion and hiked taxes on cigarettes and some busi-ness activity to offset the revenue loss. Swaps are not without controversy, particularly when theyaffect school funding. In addition, critics say tax swaps areregressive because they impose a greater burden on the poor,typically hit hardest by sales taxes. \u2014Pamela M. PrahHOT TOPICS56455_Txt 12/21/06 10:47 AM Page 44 45 HOT TOPICS S-CHIP RENEWAL States will be watching anxiously as Congress this yearretools the popular State Children's Health InsuranceProgram, which covers 4 million youngsters.S-CHIP, created in 1997, is a supplemental taxpayer-fundedprogram that gives states extra money to insure children infamilies who earn too much to qualify for traditionalMedicaid coverage. It cost $6 billion in 2004.Like Medicaid, S-CHIP is paid for by both state and federalgovernments. But the feds pick up a bigger share of the chil-dren's program. States have more leeway in S-CHIP todecide what benefits to offer and how much to chargeenrollees for premiums or co-payments.But S-CHIP has become a victim of its own success. Thepremise for the program is that states get flexibility, and, inreturn, the federal government limits the amount of moneyit would spend. The program has grown so fast in recentyears that Congress has had to find more money to cover allthe states' expenses. Congress will have to decide whether to overhaul the cur-rent system, which is supposed to cap each state's allotmentof money. Those caps haven't had much practical effect,however, because Congress regularly redistributed moneyfrom states with unspent funds to states that spent toomuch. As S-CHIP programs have grown, there has been lessmoney to reallocate.Congress must decide whether to spend even more moneyon the program or to restrict states instead. Neither choice isattractive, because capped federal spending and flexibilityfor states are two hallmarks of the program.Some advocates want to expand S-CHIP to cover parentsnationwide. Six states already do cover parents. Researchshows kids are more likely to be signed up if their parentscan get insurance, too. But others question whether the fed-eral government should be using S-CHIP funds to cover par-ents before all children are insured. \u2014Daniel C.
