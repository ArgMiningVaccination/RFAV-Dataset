To be notified of future classes, workshops, retreats and other special offerings, be sure to sign up to Timothy's private list on the home page. Liberate Yourself and Your Life! Primal Dancing, Process-Intuitive Painting, Breathwork, Sound and Voice, HeartSpeak, various forms of authentic relating, intimacy practices, self expression and improv processes, various dance and movement practices, and conscious communication practices have been MAJOR instrumental influences in my life's evolution and transformation. Psychotherapy and counseling, though very valuable and necessary for me, were not enough to heal and free me from trauma and limitations. I want this to be clear: without periods of consistent somatic-based, gestalt (parts work) trauma therapy with a therapist I felt safe with and built a trusting relationship, there is no way I would be where I am today. Yet, I can also say the same about the types of alternative processes, experiences and practices I am referring to on this page. All of this worked together to help me heal and transform my life. These healing processes and practices are major pathways promoting awakening and freeing of the primal core self. Some of these practices are deceptively simple, yet supremely powerful. I have spent a lifetime creating, practicing and evolving these practices. They lead to a profound letting go and transformation of no longer needed defenses, shame, fear, and habitual patterns that continue replicating the suffering of trauma and anxiety conditions (with all of their various symptoms, including low self esteem, failure to thrive in life, chronic blushing, sweating, panic, depression, procrastination, etc), as well as self-defeating behaviors, self-consciousness, self-criticism, self-judgment, and the projecting of the same on the external world. Imagine: experiencing self-acceptance, love for yourself and towards others, feeling free to be your authentic self, pure joy, deep intimate connection with self/others/nature/the universe; greater energy and inspiration to be, express and actualize your own dreams and greatest potential. All your relationships will benefit. There is no greater life enhancing, anti-aging, health benefiting, and magnetic, prosperity promoting acton you can take other than freeing your primal authentic expressive self! Private Sessions can be on on-line or in-person. These sessions can be 1, 1.5 or 2 hours (or longer). Longer sessions often work best as we have more time to both prepare, practice, and go into deeper, more fulfilling experiences. [Schedule here](https://imaginehealing.com/schedule/). Just wanted to reiterate what I said on the phone yesterday about how good I feel and to thank you again for your ministry. It's only been 3+ months since you began working with me on my health issues. I have to say, that compared to this time last year, I am a changed woman (and at 52 years that's saying something). I have a renewed energy for living. As I go about my day, I'll find myself whistling, humming or even doing what I think of as my \"happy dance.\" It has been a long, long time since I've felt this good. I can't wait to see how much better it can get. Thank you so much for what you do to help people! - Karen, New York Dearest Timothy, wishing you and your family all the best for the New 2014 year. I would love to thank you for your help, support and incredible healing and success to help me with my destructive behaviour. What you have achieved with me in such a short period of time, is unbelievable. Yes it is right that you can bring a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink, so for me it was the first step I have made to contact you with your wonderful personality and your way how to approach people, I knew that I have found the right person to take me to the water. It has been 6 months and I am still going strong and don't look back... - Jovana, Australia Meeting Timothy was the beginning of a rebirth for me, so to speak. The entire process was very powerful, and after it was completed, I felt like a great burden had been lifted off of me! It has been two months now, and I feel terrific in all ways. ...thanks again Timothy, for being a healer, a teacher, and someone who truly cares about the well-being of others! - Susan, New York "}
