But COVID 19 vaccines have some adverse effects that raise concerns in the global community. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the adverse effects of Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinated adults. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 15 to 30, 2022 among 421 (211 Janssen and 210 Astra Zeneca vaccinated) adults recruited by a convenience sampling technique in Debre Tabor Town, Northwest Ethiopia. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews and by reviewing the immunization card. Chi-square test, independent t-test, and Mann-Whitney test were used to compare the adverse symptoms and related parameters between the two vaccines. A linear regression model was also used to identify predictors of the number of post-vaccination symptoms. The majority (75.8%) of participants reported at least one side effect after vaccination. Adverse symptoms had a significantly greater occurrence (p < .05) among recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine (84.8%) than receivers of the Janssen vaccine (66.8%). The main adverse symptoms were injection site pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, and myalgia in both vaccines. Significant variations (p < .05) between the receipts of the two vaccines were shown in injection site pain, fever, and arthralgia. The total number of symptoms was significantly higher (p < .05) in participants with female sex, younger age, BMI <25 kg/m2, no prior COVID 19, and those who had received AstraZeneca vaccine. Thus, the authors advise that they should receive vaccines with no hesitation, while continuous tracking of vaccine safety is kept in place.
