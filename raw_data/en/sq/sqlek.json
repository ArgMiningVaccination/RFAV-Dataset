Furthermore, Gates, through his organization the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, believes this method of vaccination [would allow vaccines to reach people in the most remote corners of the world](https://www.technocracy.news/gates-who-cdc-see-peel-stick-vaccine-patches-mailed-directly-to-peoples-homes/). The billionaire claims these vaccine patches, which are needle-free, pre-dosed and easy to transport and store, can also enhance safety during the vaccination process by minimizing operational errors like needle- and injection-related injuries and incorrect dosages. The microneedle vaccines, officially known as vaccine-containing microarray patches (VMAPS) are being touted as the main instrument of the WHO, CDC and UNICEF's \"Big Catch-up\" initiative. Described as \"the largest childhood immunization effort\" in the world, \"The Big Catch-Up\" is intent on reversing \"declines in childhood vaccination recorded in over 100 countries since the pandemic.\" Proponents of microneedle vaccine patches claim these vaccines can inoculate everybody using all kinds of vaccines, everything from measles and rubella vaccines to the various mRNA vaccines currently in development. But many scientific and medical experts warn that this technology is very dangerous. Dr. Brian Hooker, senior director of science and research for Children's Health Defense, noted that the term \"vaccine patch \" is misleading because the technology used is nothing like other patch-based delivery systems such as the ones currently used for nicotine or certain hormones. \"This 'patch' still breaks the skin in order to deliver the liquid vaccine that is contained in the microarray's matrix. As such, I don't quite understand how this injection system will be delivered to patients and parents to administer the vaccine directly. That seems quite risky,\" said Hooker. \"Unfortunately, repackaging the same vaccines in this different platform [also] does nothing to improve their safety - as this seems more a ploy to convince consumers otherwise.\" \"Whether it is delivered by a needle or a patch, a VMAP is a biological product that atypically manipulates the immune system to provoke strong inflammatory responses that can lead to injury or death for some who receive it,\" warned Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center. Fisher noted that the medical literature describing microneedle vaccine patches does not focus on their safety and efficacy and instead on \"how much easier it will be for the vaccinations to slap a patch on a child's skin instead of using a needle, and how the 'painless' patch can reduce vaccine hesitancy,\" which to Fisher is a glaring warning. \"[Vaccine hesitancy] has never been about how the product is delivered,\" she continued. \"It has always been about the lack of evidence demonstrating safety.\" Follow [PharmaceuticalFraud.com](https://pharmaceuticalfraud.com/) for more news on Big Pharma's experimental vaccines.
