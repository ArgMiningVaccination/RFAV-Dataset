If you are creating ANY kind of Gem Water for consumption, you absolutely want to be sure that the crystals and minerals you are using are not toxic. To be safe, always check to be sure there are no toxic minerals in the crystals or stones you plan to use that can leech out into the water. If there is, there are safe, alternative methods to work with that stone's energies. (see making Gem Water and Elixirs page [here](https://www.soulsticejourney.com/crystal-numerology)) Here is a list of crystals that should never be immersed and/or stored in water, including salt water. This also goes for making any sort of essences, gem water or elixirs. They will lose their polish and become dull and some may dissolve. A quick cleanse under water is fine, but do not submerse for extended periods of time. - Fluorite (especially SALT water) - Selenite - Apophyllite - Tangerine Quartz - Gypsum - Lepidolite Opal - Azurite - Apatite - Halite - Labradorite - Celestite - Pyrite - Hematite If you would like to work with crystals in fresh water, here are a few safe options. I do not recommend using salt water at any time. - Clear Quartz - Rose Quartz - Amethyst - Smokey Quartz - Citrine - Agate - Moonstone - Carnelian - Rutilated Quartz - Jasper - Tiger's Eye - Aventurine - Black Obsidian (FYI: can break in EXTREME cold or hot water temperatures) This is not a comprehensive toxic crystals and stones list. I am always adding new information when available. Please always do your own (scientific based) research in addition to checking here from time to time. Remember, when in doubt, do without!
