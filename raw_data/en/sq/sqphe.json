In contrast, your body doesn't allow overdosing from the sun alone. When your vitamin D levels reach a high, potentially toxic level, your skin stops allowing the production of vitamin D.\\nYou can get vitamin D intoxication if you take a very large dose for a prolonged period of time, or a huge dose for a short period of time.\\nSymptoms of vitamin D overdose\\nVitamin D intoxication involves some specific and nonspecific symptoms:\\n\\n Confusion\\n \\n Marked thirst and dehydration\\n \\n Increased urination\\n \\n Constipation\\n \\n Heart rhythm abnormalities\\n \\n Nausea\\n \\n appetite\\n \\n Vomiting\\n \\n Weakness\\n \\n Weight loss\\n \\n\\nTo really know if these symptoms are due to vitamin D toxicity, you need to get some tests done at your doctor's office. These tests show:\\n\\n Elevated levels of calcium in the serum and urine\\n \\n Elevated level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, usually more than 150 ng/ml (375 nmol/L)\\n \\n Parathyroid hormone level usually undetectable\\n \\n\\nIf the toxicity is allowed to continue for more than a few days, the person faces a risk of permanent kidney damage as well as death from heart arrhythmias, dehydration, and abnormal blood salt (electrolyte) levels. Calcium may also be laid down like bone in many areas of the body where it isn't usually found, such as the lining of blood vessels, thereby increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke.\\nExamples of vitamin D overdose\\nInstances of vitamin D overdose have occurred, but they've generally been inadvertent. Consider a few examples from the medical literature:\\n\\n Twenty people in Massachusetts got vitamin D toxicity from their milk when a worker at a local dairy put way too much vitamin D into milk. Milk is normally supplemented with 100 IU vitamin D3 per cup, but the milk from this dairy had as much as 50,000 IU per cup. All of the people who came down with vitamin D toxicity after drinking this milk were heavy milk drinkers. Luckily everyone recovered after this mistake was corrected.\\n \\n A 2-year-old boy was given an ampule of vitamin D a day instead of two drops. Each ampule contained 600,000 IU; he received four ampules, or 2.4 million IU. The boy developed severe high calcium, colic, and constipation. He recovered fully after the improper dosing stopped.\\n \\n A 60-year-old man was taking a supplement that hadn't been properly diluted. He was taking 1 million units daily. The man experienced some nausea and elevated calcium that improved as soon as he stopped the supplement, with no long-term adverse effect.\\n \\n A health guru taking his own Ultimate Power Meal became sick with nausea and constipation. He found that the manufacturer of his meals had been erroneously putting 2 million IU in each meal. Some of his customers suffered kidney damage, but the guru didn't.\\n \\n\",\"item_vector\":null},\"titleHighlight\":null,\"descriptionHighlights\":null,\"headers\":null},{\"objectType\":\"article\",\"id\":186901,\"data\":{\"title\":\"How Vitamin D Affects Your Health\",\"slug\":\"how-vitamin-d-affects-your-health\",\"update_time\":\"2016-03-26T20:17:59+00:00\",\"object_type\":\"article\",\"image\":null,\"breadcrumbs\":[{\"name\":\"Body, Mind, & Spirit\",\"slug\":\"body-mind-spirit\",\"categoryId\":34038},{\"name\":\"Physical Health & Well-Being\",\"slug\":\"physical-health-well-being\",\"categoryId\":34095},{\"name\":\"Diet & Nutrition\",\"slug\":\"diet-nutrition\",\"categoryId\":34102},{\"name\":\"Vitamins & Supplements\",\"slug\":\"vitamins-supplements\",\"categoryId\":34135}],\"description\":\"The medical community has known of the benefits of vitamin D on bone health for decades. In recent years, scientists have discovered that vitamin D may play a role in many other aspects of our health. This overview provides a look at some areas in which vitamin D may improve health and prevent diseases.\\nBuilding bone with vitamin D\\nThe work of calcitriol (active vitamin D) is intimately linked to the way your body uses calcium. Active vitamin D levels increase when you regularly eat a diet low in calcium. When elevated, the role of calcitriol begins in the intestine, where it promotes increased absorption of calcium in an effort to overcome your low dietary calcium intake.\\nCalcitriol also influences the kidneys, where it keeps calcium from leaving in the urine. In the skeleton, calcitriol causes both the production of the framework of the bone and the mineralization of that framework with calcium and phosphate. On the other hand, abnormally high levels of calcitriol cause bone to break down and too much calcium to be absorbed by the intestines; this can cause toxic levels of blood calcium.\\nNormal levels of calcitriol promote the breakdown of old bone and the creation of new bone. Another way that calcitriol protects bone is by influencing the production of the parathyroid hormone. If you have a deficiency of vitamin D, you can't make enough calcitriol. As a result, the parathyroid gland makes more parathyroid hormone which goes to bone and breaks it down to release calcium into the bloodstream. If this goes on too long, the increase in parathyroid hormone is detrimental, leading to weakened bones.\\nRestoring vitamin D and calcitriol levels to normal allows the skeleton to regain lost calcium and strength. Maintaining the calcium level in the blood is important for the body's muscle function: heart muscles, skeletal muscles, and all other muscles.\\nAs they grow, children add more bone than they break down, so bone mass increases. When you're a kid, calcium absorption from the diet has to be very efficient to meet the needs of growing bone, so active vitamin D is important at this stage of life. When you stop growing, there is still a lot of activity going on in the bone. About 10 to 30 percent of the bone in your body is renewed yearly.\\nAfter you reach your 30s, you begin to lose slightly more bone than the amount you make, so you have a net loss of bone. At menopause, women lose bone mass even more rapidly. Because of all this bone loss during adulthood you need to build up plenty of bone at a younger age so that by the time you start to lose more bone mass than you gain, you can avoid osteoporosis, a condition in which the bones are fragile and can fracture.\\nReducing your risk of cancer with vitamin D\\nOne promising role for vitamin D is in the prevention of cancer. In some studies, the rates of certain but not all cancers appear to be lower the closer you live to the equator. Some scientists think that this is because you make more vitamin D in your skin the closer you live to the equator. Other studies show that high blood levels of vitamin D (25OH D) are associated with lower rates of a number of cancers.\\nScientists estimate that higher blood vitamin D levels could cause:\\n\\n A 50 percent reduction in the risk of colon cancer\\n \\n A 30 percent reduction in the risk of breast cancer\\n \\n A 30 percent reduction in the risk of ovarian cancer\\n \\n A 43 percent reduction in the risk of pancreatic cancer\\n \\n\\nCalcitriol has been shown to slow the growth of cancer cells isolated from the breast, the prostate, and the colon, and it can kill cancer cells in culture. Unfortunately, it isn't yet known whether this ability to slow or even kill cancer cells occurs in humans. The high doses of calcitriol needed in cell culture studies would cause toxic, high levels of blood calcium if they were used in humans.\\nPreventing heart disease and diabetes with vitamin D\\nStill other studies are pointing to a possible role for high blood vitamin D levels in the prevention of other chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.\\nIf you looked at a graph comparing the average blood pressure of the population with the distance from the equator, you'd see that blood pressure rises the farther you get from the equator and its strong sun rays (and, therefore, greater skin production of vitamin D). The change in blood pressure might have nothing to do with vitamin D, but it seems reasonable to assume that it does.\\nStudies in animals show that calcitriol can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of an enlarged heart. Calcitriol also relaxes blood vessels, which further lowers blood pressure.\\nThere is also evidence that higher blood vitamin D levels might also protect against the development of diabetes. This might be related to observations that calcitriol can alter the cells of the immune system to suppress autoimmunity, the reaction of the body against itself.\\nType 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease, so active vitamin D might help limit the development of this disease. At the same time, studies in animals and cell cultures suggest that calcitriol improves insulin secretion from the pancreas and increases the sensitivity of cells to the action of insulin. These actions might help prevent and treat type 2 diabetes.\",\"item_vector\":null},\"titleHighlight\":null,\"descriptionHighlights\":null,\"headers\":null},{\"objectType\":\"article\",\"id\":201788,\"data\":{\"title\":\"Signs of Vitamin Deficiencies in Your Diet\",\"slug\":\"signs-of-vitamin-deficiencies-in-your-diet\",\"update_time\":\"2016-03-26T22:59:37+00:00\",\"object_type\":\"article\",\"image\":null,\"breadcrumbs\":[{\"name\":\"Body, Mind, & Spirit\",\"slug\":\"body-mind-spirit\",\"categoryId\":34038},{\"name\":\"Physical Health & Well-Being\",\"slug\":\"physical-health-well-being\",\"categoryId\":34095},{\"name\":\"Diet & Nutrition\",\"slug\":\"diet-nutrition\",\"categoryId\":34102},{\"name\":\"Vitamins & Supplements\",\"slug\":\"vitamins-supplements\",\"categoryId\":34135}],\"description\":\"Nutritional Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs) are broad enough to prevent vitamin deficiencies and avoid the side effects associated with large doses of some vitamins. If your diet doesn't meet these nutrition guidelines, or if you take extreme amounts of vitamins as supplements, you may be in for trouble.\\nThe good news is that vitamin deficiencies are rare among people who have access to a wide variety of foods and know how to put together a balanced diet. For example, the only people likely to experience a vitamin E deficiency are premature and/or low-birth weight infants and people with a metabolic disorder that keeps them from absorbing fat. A healthy adult may go as long as 10 years on a vitamin E-deficient diet without developing any signs of a problem.\\nNutritionists use the term subclinical deficiency to describe a nutritional deficit not yet far enough advanced to produce obvious symptoms. In lay terms, however, the phrase has become a handy explanation for common but hard-to-pin-down symptoms, such as fatigue, irritability, nervousness, emotional depression, allergies, and insomnia. And it's a dandy way to increase the sale of nutritional supplements.\\nSimply put, the RDAs protect you against deficiency. If your odd symptoms linger even after you take reasonable amounts of vitamin supplements, probably something other than a lack of any one vitamin is to blame. The following table lists the symptoms of various vitamin deficiencies.\\n\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Don't Get the Vitamins You Need\\n\\n\\nA Diet Low in This Vitamin\\nMay Produce These Signs of Deficiency\\n\\n\\nVitamin A\\nPoor night vision; dry, rough, or cracked skin; dry mucous\\nmembranes including the inside of the eye; slow wound healing;\\nnerve damage; reduced ability to taste, hear, and smell; inability\\nto perspire; reduced resistance to respiratory infections\\n\\n\\nVitamin D\\nIn children: rickets (weak muscles, delayed tooth development,\\nand soft bones, all caused by the inability to absorb minerals\\nwithout vitamin D)\\nIn adults: osteomalacia (soft, porous bones membranes, skin rashes;\\nupset stomach; nerve damage (in infants)\\n\\n\\nFolate\\nAnemia (immature red blood cells)\\n\\n\\nVitamin B12\\nPernicious anemia (destruction of red blood cells, nerve\\ndamage, increased risk of stomach cancer attributed to damaged\\nstomach tissue, neurological/psychiatric symptoms attributed to\\nnerve cell depression; skin rashes (in infants younger than 6\\nmonths)\\n\\n\",\"item_vector\":null},\"titleHighlight\":null,\"descriptionHighlights\":null,\"headers\":null},{\"objectType\":\"article\",\"id\":187973,\"data\":{\"title\":\"Key Points You Need to Know about Vitamin D\",\"slug\":\"key-points-you-need-to-know-about-vitamin-d\",\"update_time\":\"2016-03-26T20:31:22+00:00\",\"object_type\":\"article\",\"image\":null,\"breadcrumbs\":[{\"name\":\"Body, Mind, & Spirit\",\"slug\":\"body-mind-spirit\",\"categoryId\":34038},{\"name\":\"Physical Health & Well-Being\",\"slug\":\"physical-health-well-being\",\"categoryId\":34095},{\"name\":\"Diet & Nutrition\",\"slug\":\"diet-nutrition\",\"categoryId\":34102},{\"name\":\"Vitamins & Supplements\",\"slug\":\"vitamins-supplements\",\"categoryId\":34135}],\"description\":\"Even as researchers continue to discover how vitamin D can protect your health, a lot of misinformation still surrounds this amazing vitamin.
