Detoxing With Traditional Foods: How To Build A Nourishing Detox Soup To build a soup that supports your body's natural detox process, we must start with [bone broth](https://traditionalcookingschool.com/food-preparation/recipes/perpetual-stock-broth/?utm_campaign=autoblog&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=bloglink&utm_content=Detoxing+With+Traditional+Foods%3A+A+Nourishing+Soup+For+Gentle%2C+Full-Body+Cleansing), then add nourishing vegetables, herbs, and spices. Let's discuss each of these components, one-by-one, in more detail... Step #1: The Bone Broth Foundation Every nourishing soup begins with bone broth. Any bone broth can be used ( [even fish](https://traditionalcookingschool.com/food-preparation/recipes/the-secret-of-fish-stock/?utm_campaign=autoblog&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=bloglink&utm_content=Detoxing+With+Traditional+Foods%3A+A+Nourishing+Soup+For+Gentle%2C+Full-Body+Cleansing)!), yet chicken broth is probably the most common.

Furthermore, your kidneys require plenty of fluids (as well as minerals \u2014 also present in bone broth) to flush toxins out of the body. Strong kidneys ease some of the burden on your liver, allowing it to work more efficiently as well.

Step #2: Veggies That Support Detox Now that you have your bone broth base, it's time to choose veggies!

Many herbs contain nutrients that not only elevate the flavor of your soup, but the nutrition (and healthy detox support) as well. These include...
