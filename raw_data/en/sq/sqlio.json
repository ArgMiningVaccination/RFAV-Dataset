Researchers are supported by funding from the Australian Government and state governments, corporate sponsors and philanthropic organisations, as well as from fundraising programs facilitated by The Royal Children's Hospital Foundation and Murdoch Childrens Research Institute.How you can get involved in research The strength of research on our campus depends on children and parents/carers participating in research. Whilst your child is at the hospital, you and your child may be approached about your child taking part in research. Your child's contribution could help to provide better care both for your child and for other children in the future. Involvement in research may involve lling in questionnaires or surveys, trialling a different medication or treatment, or undergoing extra tests or procedures. All research projects on the campus undergo an ethical review before being approved. Before agreeing to allow your child to take part in a research project, be sure both you and Coming to hospitalYour guide to The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne | 27your child understand what is involved and ask questions about the project. There is no nancial cost to you associated with taking part in research and there is no obligation for your child to take part in research.

Pre-Admission Resource Centre The Pre-Admission Resource Centre is a service available to all surgical patients, to prepare them for elective surgery. Before your child is placed on the surgical waiting list, you will be asked to complete a risk screen questionnaire and you may meet with an anaesthetist, a nurse, an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, a play therapist, and/or a surgeon. This service provides an opportunity for any clinical examinations, tests and conversations to occur prior to admission. Appointments can be made by your referring doctor at the time that the procedure is booked, or families can contact the service directly.

Any patient who has a procedure other than as a 'day patient' will potentially be seen by the acute pain management team to ensure that pain management is optimised. The chronic pain management clinic is accessed by medical referral, usually as an outpatient. 'Pain Pain Go Away' is a booklet available to families from the Family Resource and Respite Centre or the Pre-Admission Resource Centre. Fasting Children don't like being hungry or thirsty, but fasting is necessary to make anaesthesia as safe as possible. Please refer to your admission letter from the hospital and follow the fasting instructions carefully. If you do not follow the instructions, the operation or procedure may be postponed. If you have any questions about the fasting instructions, please contact your child's doctor or our Pre-Admission Resource Centre. Pre-Admission Resource Centre 9345 4115During your visitYour guide to The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne | 31Consent Consent is giving permission for a test, operation or procedure to go ahead. The doctor will let you know why the test, operation or procedure needs to be done, what will be done and how it will be done. You will also be told of any problems or risks that may occur. It is important that you fully understand the test, operation or procedure your child will have. For some procedures and operations you will be asked to sign a consent form after talking with your child's doctor. Please take your time to ask any questions you may have. There is no rush to complete the form. There may be a fact sheet about the test, procedure or operation your child is to have\u2014please ask the doctor. If your child is old enough, the doctor may ask for their views and permission for the test, operation or procedure to go ahead. Patient identication When your child is admitted to hospital he/she will have an identication band attached around their wrist or ankle. The band tells the staff your child's name and date of birth, and their unique RCH number (UR number). A trip to theatre involves travelling through a number of different areas, such as the pre-operative hold area, the operating theatre, and the recovery area. Your child will be cared for by a number of different medical and nursing staff members.For this reason you will be asked on a number of occasions to conrm that the information contained on your child's identication band is correct, and that the procedure undertaken is the one documented on the consent form you have signed.

This band should have the name of your child, his/her hospital record number (UR number) and date of birth. If your child doesn't have one on, or it has fallen off, please let our nursing staff know so that it can be replaced as soon as possible. In addition to checking the patient identication band, staff will ask you to state: 8.41!'(+\"2$4++- ,# 8.41!'(+\"2\" 3#.$ (13'6' 38.4 1#'#1#$.1 These checks must happen before any procedure begins to make sure that the right child gets the right care. Don't be alarmed by these questions\u2014 the staff need to conrm who your child is. Prevention of infection Children admitted to hospital could be exposed to infections by the procedures/treatments they may have, or their condition makes them susceptible to infection. To reduce this risk, we have many strategies and procedures in place, such as appropriate cleaning, disinfection and sterilisation of equipment, management of known infections, hand hygiene and environmental cleaning. Infection Control 9345 574056 | Your guide to The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne Hand hygiene Doctors, nurses and other health care workers should wash their hands before and after each patient contact. It is the policy of the RCH to practise hand hygiene and for all staff to inform visitors to perform hand hygiene. To promote hand hygiene, an alcohol- based gel is provided in the wards. This gel can kill germs without the use of water. Parents and visitors are encouraged to use the gel. Spread the gel over the surfaces of both hands and allow to dry (15 seconds). It may be used instead of washing your hands with soap and water. If your hands are visibly dirty, do not use the gel, use soap and water. When to wash your Please discuss with the nursing staff any signs of infection you may have, such as diarrhoea, vomiting, temperature, cough, rash etc. Please also inform staff if you or your child has had contact with someone who has an infection eg chicken pox. Falls Falls in children are not uncommon. While in hospital, please remember to use bed or cot sides at all times. If you are unsure of how to use the bed or cot sides, please ask the staff to show you. Supervision The hospital is an unfamiliar place for children. Please don't let your children wander around the wards or hospital unsupervised. Let the staff know when you are leaving the ward and ensure visiting children are always supervised. Balloons Latex (rubber) balloons can cause serious injury, such as choking, eye injuries, allergies and strangulation. These are not permitted on the wards. Foil balloons are allowed on the ward, but the string must be no longer than 30 centimetres (the length of a ruler).Parent tip All parents, patients and carers may ask staff members, 'Have you washed your hands?'Working together to provide careYour guide to The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne | 57Hot liquids Hot liquids can burn, so please do not have hot drinks near children.
