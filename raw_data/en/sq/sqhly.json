This journey offers an insight into a Bali that is not commonly seen, and allows you to experience the charming culture of rural Bali. A fantastic day out packed with education and fun! You will begin your Countryside Cycle Tour in Penestanan Kaja (a small village northwest of central Ubud), cycling alongside the rice fields, which have inspired painters and poets for centuries.Along the way, you will see local farmers, ducks, exotic tropical birds like the kingfisher, small lizards and lots of dragonfies & butterflies. You will see banyan trees, temples and special sacred sites, which might be wrapped in a special black and white checkered cloth called poleng. You will enter small, narrow alleys, which zigzag across stone paths, the trail then opening onto a landscape where the colors change according to the period in the cycle of local rice cultivation. These rice fields, known as padi, form the core of the Balinese diet. Small, green shoots are planted directly into the muddy, fertile water, which over time, having matured and turned a golden color, may grow well over a meter in height. *This can be chosen as a Bliss Day Option on our other retreat programs - Goddess](https://www.goddessretreats.com/testimonial/ubud-wellness-goddess-retreat/), [Bali Goddess](https://www.goddessretreats.com/goddess-packages/bali-retreat/), [Fitness Goddess](https://www.goddessretreats.com/goddess-packages/fitness-retreat/), [Surf Goddess. ](https://www.goddessretreats.com/goddess-packages/surf-retreat/)This is also an individual option that can be added while on your retreat program for an additional fee.
