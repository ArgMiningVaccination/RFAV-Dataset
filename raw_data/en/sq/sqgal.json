Currently, the ability to sequence the genome of whole organisms presents opportunities that could be hardly envisioned ten years ago.Many other technological advances have occurred that provide bioprocess engineers withnew tools to serve society better. However, the principles of bioprocess engineering statedin the first edition remain sound. The goals of this revision are threefold. We want to capture for students the excite- ment created by these advances in biology and biotechnology. We want to inform studentsabout these tools. Most importantly, we want to demonstrate how the principles of bio-process engineering can be applied in concert with these advances. This edition contains a new section in the first chapter alerting students to the regu- latory issues that constrain bioprocess design and modification. We believe students needto be aware of these industrially critical issues. Part 2, \"An Overview of BiologicalBasics,\" has been updated throughout and expanded. Greater emphasis is given now toposttranslational processing of proteins, as this is a key issue in choice of bioprocessingstrategies to make therapeutic proteins. Basic processes in animal cells are more com-pletely described, since animal cell culture is now an established commercial bioprocesstechnology. Chapter 5 is made more complete by introduction of a section on noncarbohy-drate metabolism. Key concepts in functional genomics have been added to prepare stu-dents to understand the impact of these emerging ideas and technologies on bioprocesses.5203fm01.qxd_sm 10/9/2001 9:36 AM Page xviiIn Part 3, \"Engineering Principles for Bioprocesses,\" greater attention is given to is- sues associated with animal cell bioreactors. The discussion of chromatographic processes is expanded. In Part 4, \"Applications to Nonconventional Biological Systems,\" the mate-rial has been rearranged and updated and a new chapter added. These changes are evidentin the chapters on animal and plant cell culture. Particularly important is the expandeddiscussion on choice of host-vector systems for production of proteins from recombinantDNA technology. Coverage of two areas of increasing importance to bioprocess engi-neers, metabolic and protein engineering, has been expanded. A new chapter on biomed-ical applications illustrates how approaches to bioprocess engineering are relevant toproblems typically considered to be biomedical engineering. The chapter on mixed cul-tures has been extended to cover advanced waste-water treatment processes. An appendixproviding descriptive overviews of some traditional bioprocesses is now included. The suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter have been updated. We are unable in this book to provide in-depth treatment of many vital topics. These read-ings give students an easy way to begin to learn more about these topics. Teaching a subject as broad as bioprocess engineering in the typical one-semester, three-credit class has never been easy. Although some material in the first edition has beenremoved or condensed, the second edition is longer than the first. For students with noformal background in biology, coverage of all of the material in this book would require afour-credit class. In a three-credit class we suggest that the instructor cover Chapters 1 to11 (with 7 being optional) and then decide on subsequent chapters based on course goals.A course oriented toward biopharmaceuticals will want to include careful coverage ofChapters 12 and 14 and some coverage of 13 and 15. A course oriented toward utilizationof bioresources would emphasize Chapter 16 and the Appendix and selected coverage oftopics in Chapters 13 and 14. Many students now enter a bioprocess engineering course with formal, college-level instruction in biology and biochemistry. For such students Chapters 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 canbe given as reading assignments to refresh their memories and to insure a uniform, mini-mal level of biological knowledge. Lecture time can be reserved for material in otherchapters or for supplementary material. For these five chapters study questions are pro-vided for self-testing. Under these circumstances the instructor should be able to cover therest of the material in the book. Once again we have been assisted by comments from many colleagues across the world. These comments have included suggestions for new material to be incorporatedand for corrections. While the list is too long to include here, specific contributions de-serve special recognition. Mohammad Ataai provided us a summary of IMAC (immobi-lized metal affinity chromatography) that has been incorporated into the revision. KelvinLee provided the paragraph describing 2-D gel electrophoresis. We thank LauraPalomares for an excellent job in updating and revising a first draft of the Appendix ontraditional bioprocesses. The first edition of this book was translated into Korean, andYoon-Mo Koo, Jin Ho Seo, Yong Keun Chang, and Tai Hyun Park provided us an exten-sive list of corrections, which has been very helpful in preparation of this revision. We wish to also thank our families for their support during the process of this revision. xviii Preface to the Second Edition5203fm01.qxd_sm 10/9/2001 9:36 AM Page xviiiPreface to the First Edition xixBioprocess engineering is the application of engineering principles to design, develop, and analyze processes using biocatalysts. These processes may result in the formation ofdesirable compounds or in the destruction of unwanted or hazardous substances. The toolsof the engineer, particularly the chemical engineer, will be essential to the successful ex-ploitation of bioprocesses. This book's main purpose is to introduce the essential concepts of bioprocessing to traditional chemical engineers. No background in biology is assumed. The material in thisbook has been used as a basis for a course at Cornell University. Although it was designedprimarily for seniors and entering graduate students from chemical engineering, studentsfrom agricultural engineering, environmental engineering, food science, soil science,microbiology, and biochemistry have successfully completed this course. Parts 1 and 2 outline basic biological concepts. These eight chapters are not in- tended to be a replacement for good courses in microbiology, biochemistry, and genetics.They simply provide sufficient information to make the rest of the book accessible to thereader. A reader who desires a more in-depth understanding of the key biological conceptsis referred to the suggested readings at the end of each chapter. Chapters 3 and 6 differ inthat they are more detailed and introduce concepts not normally found in the standard bio-logical textbooks. In Part 3, \"Engineering Principles for Bioprocesses,\" we focus on the generic com- ponents of bioprocessing that do not depend on the type of cell used in the process. In5203fm01.qxd_sm 10/2/2001 9:21 AM Page xixPart 4 we discuss applications to special systems and the particular characteristics of mixed cultures, genetically engineered cells, plant cells, and animal cells. These applica-tion chapters reinforce the previous engineering and biological concepts while providingmore detailed information about important new biological systems. This book reflects useful and important suggestions from many people. Students in Chemical Engineering 643 (\"Introduction to Bioprocess Engineering\") at Cornell Univer-sity in Fall 1989 provided written critiques on the chapters. This input has been invaluableand is deeply appreciated. The two external reviewers of this text also provided invaluablesuggestions. Harvey Blanch, Charles D. Scott, and Octave Levenspiel have provided oneof us (FK) with suggested homework problems, which have greatly enhanced the poten-tial usefulness of this book. Finally, the superb technical skills of Bonnie Sisco have beeninstrumental in converting nearly incomprehensible written scrawls into a readable text. Finally, both authors wish to thank their families for their patience and support dur- ing this process. Michael L. Shuler Fikret Kargi xx Preface to the First Edition5203fm01.qxd_sm 10/2/2001 9:21 AM Page xxPART 1 Introduction 11.1. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS We can now manipulate life at its most basic level\u2014the genetic. For thousands of years people have practiced genetic engineering at the level of selection and breeding. But nowit can be done in a purposeful, predetermined manner with the molecular-level manipula-tion of DNA. We now have a tool to probe the mysteries of life in a way unimaginable 25years ago. With this intellectual revolution emerge new visions and new hopes: new medicines, semisynthetic organs grown in large vats, abundant and nutritious foods, computers basedon biological molecules rather than silicon chips, superorganisms to degrade pollutants,and a wide array of consumer products and industrial processes. These dreams will remain dreams without hard work. Engineers will play an essen- tial role in converting these visions into reality. Biological systems are very complex andbeautifully constructed, but they obey the rules of chemistry and physics and they are sus-ceptible to engineering analysis. Living cells are predictable, and the processes to usethem can be rationally constructed on commercial scales. Doing this is the job of the bio-process engineer. Probably the reason you are reading this book is your desire to participate in this in- tellectual revolution and to make an important contribution to society. You cando it, but it1 What Is a Bioprocess Engineer?ch01.cou 10/11/01 4:22 PM Page 1is not easy to combine the skills of the engineer with those of the biologist. Our intent is to help you begin to develop these skills. This book and a one-term course are not enoughto make you a complete bioprocess engineer, but we intend to help you form the neces-sary foundation. 1.2. BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOPROCESS ENGINEERING When new fields emerge from new ideas, old words are usually not adequate to describe these fields. Biotechnology and what constitutes engineering in this field are best de-scribed with examples rather than single words or short phrases. Biotechnology usually implies the use or development of methods of direct genetic manipulation for a socially desirable goal. Such goals might be the production of a partic-ular chemical, but they may also involve the production of better plants or seeds, or genetherapy, or the use of specially designed organisms to degrade wastes. The key elementfor many workers is the use of sophisticated techniques outside the cell for genetic manip-ulation. Others interpret biotechnology in a much broader sense and equate it with appliedbiology; they may include engineering as a subcomponent of biotechnology. Many words have been used to describe engineers working with biotechnology. Bioengineering is a broad title and would include work on medical and agricultural sys- tems; its practitioners include agricultural, electrical, mechanical, industrial, environmen-tal and chemical engineers, and others. Biological engineering is similar but emphasizes applications to plants and animals. Biochemical engineering has usually meant the exten- sion of chemical engineering principles to systems using a biological catalyst to bringabout desired chemical transformations. It is often subdivided into bioreaction engineer-ing and bioseparations. Biomedical engineering has been considered to be totally separate from biochemical engineering, although the boundary between the two is increasinglyvague, particularly in the areas of cell surface receptors and animal cell culture. Anotherrelevant term is biomolecular engineering, which has been defined by the National Insti- tutes of Health as \". . . research at the interface of biology and chemical engineering and isfocused at the molecular level.\" There is a difference between bioprocess engineering and biochemical engineering. In addition to chemical engineering, bioprocess engineering would include the work of mechanical, electrical, and industrial engineers to apply the principles of their disciplinesto processes based on using living cells or subcomponents of such cells. The problems ofdetailed equipment design, sensor development, control algorithms, and manufacturingstrategies can utilize principles from these disciplines. Biochemical engineering is morelimited in the sense that it draws primarily from chemical engineering principles andbroader in the sense that it is not restricted to well-defined artificially constructedprocesses, but can be applied to natural systems. We will focus primarily on the application of chemical engineering principles to systems containing biological catalysts, but with an emphasis on those systems makinguse of biotechnology. The rapidly increasing ability to determine the complete sequenceof genes in an organism offers new opportunities for bioprocess engineers in the designand monitoring of bioprocesses. The cell, itself, is now a designable component of theoverall process. 2 What Is a Bioprocess Engineer? Chap. 1ch01.cou 10/11/01 4:22 PM Page 21.3. BIOLOGISTS AND ENGINEERS DIFFER IN THEIR APPROACH TO RESEARCH The fundamental trainings of biologists and engineers are distinctly different. In the devel- opment of knowledge in the life sciences, unlike chemistry and physics, mathematical theo-ries and quantitative methods (except statistics) have played a secondary role. Most progresshas been due to improvements in experimental tools. Results are qualitative and descriptivemodels are formulated and tested. Consequently, biologists often have incomplete back-grounds in mathematics but are very strong with respect to laboratory tools and, more im-portantly, with respect to the interpretation of laboratory data from complex systems. Engineers usually possess a very good background in the physical and mathematical sciences. Often a theory leads to mathematical formulations, and the validity of the theoryis tested by comparing predicted responses to those in experiments. Quantitative modelsand approaches, even to complex systems, are strengths. Biologists are usually better atthe formation of testable hypotheses, experimental design, and data interpretation fromcomplex systems. Engineers are typically unfamiliar with the experimental techniquesand strategies used by life scientists. The skills of the engineer and life scientist are complementary. To convert the promises of molecular biology into new processes to make new products requires the inte-gration of these skills. To function at this level, the engineer needs a solid understandingof biology and its experimental tools. In this book we provide sufficient biological back-ground for you to understand the chapters on applying engineering principles to biosys-tems. However, if you are serious about becoming a bioprocess engineer, you will need totake further courses in microbiology, biochemistry, and cell biology, as well as more ad-vanced work in biochemical engineering. If you already have these courses, these chapterscan be used for review. 1.4. THE STORY OF PENICILLIN: HOW BIOLOGISTS AND ENGINEERS WORK TOGETHER In September 1928, Alexander Fleming at St. Mary's Hospital in London was trying to isolate the bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus , which causes boils. The technique in use was to grow the bacterium on the surface of a nutrient solution. One of the dishes hadbeen contaminated inadvertently with a foreign particle. Normally, such a contaminatedplate would be tossed out. However, Fleming noticed that no bacteria grew near the invad-ing substance (see Fig. 1.1). Fleming's genius was to realize that this observation was meaningful and not a \"failed\" experiment. Fleming recognized that the cell killing must be due to an antibacter-ial agent. He recovered the foreign particle and found that it was a common mold of thePenicillium genus (later identified as Penicillium notatum ). Fleming nurtured the mold to grow and, using the crude extraction methods then available, managed to obtain a tinyquantity of secreted material. He then demonstrated that this material had powerful an-timicrobial properties and named the product penicillin. Fleming carefully preserved theculture, but the discovery lay essentially dormant for over a decade. Sec. 1.4 The Story of Penicillin: How Biologists and Engineers Work Together 3ch01.cou 10/11/01 4:22 PM Page 3World War II provided the impetus to resurrect the discovery. Sulfa drugs have a rather restricted range of activity, and an antibiotic with minimal side effects andbroader applicability was desperately needed. Howard Florey and Ernst Chain of Ox-ford decided to build on Fleming's observations. Norman Heatley played the key rolein producing sufficient material for Chain and Florey to test the effectiveness of peni-cillin. Heatley, trained as a biochemist, performed as a bioprocess engineer. He devel-oped an assay to monitor the amount of penicillin made so as to determine the kineticsof the fermentation, developed a culture technique that could be implemented easily,and devised a novel back-extraction process to recover the very delicate product. Aftermonths of immense effort, they produced enough penicillin to treat some laboratoryanimals. Eighteen months after starting on the project, they began to treat a London bobby for a blood infection. The penicillin worked wonders initially and brought the patient tothe point of recovery. Most unfortunately, the supply of penicillin was exhausted and theman relapsed and died. Nonetheless, Florey and Chain had demonstrated the great poten-tial for penicillin, if it could be made in sufficient amount. To make large amounts of peni-cillin would require a process, and for such a process development, engineers would beneeded, in addition to microbial physiologists and other life scientists. The war further complicated the situation. Great Britain's industrial facilities were already totally devoted to the war. Florey and his associates approached pharmaceuticalfirms in the United States to persuade them to develop the capacity to produce penicillin,since the United States was not at war at that time. 4 What Is a Bioprocess Engineer?

Particularly prominent were Merck, Pfizer, Squibb, and the USDANorthern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois. The first efforts with fermentation were modest. A large effort went into attempts to chemically synthesize penicillin. This effort involved hundreds of chemists. Conse-quently, many companies were at first reluctant to commit to the fermentation process, be-yond the pilot-plant stage. It was thought that the pilot-plant fermentation system couldproduce sufficient penicillin to meet the needs of clinical testing, but large-scale produc-tion would soon be done by chemical synthesis. At that time, U.S. companies hadachieved a great deal of success with chemical synthesis of other drugs, which gave thecompanies a great deal of control over the drug's production. The chemical synthesis ofpenicillin proved to be exceedingly difficult. (It was accomplished in the 1950s, and thesynthesis route is still not competitive with fermentation.) However, in 1940 fermentationfor the production of a pharmaceutical was an unproved approach, and most companieswere betting on chemical synthesis to ultimately dominate. The early clinical successes were so dramatic that in 1943 the War Production Board appointed A. L. Elder to coordinate the activities of producers to greatly increasethe supply of penicillin. The fermentation route was chosen. As Elder recalls, \"I wasridiculed by some of my closest scientific friends for allowing myself to become associ-ated with what obviously was to be a flop\u2014namely, the commercial production of peni-cillin by a fermentation process\" (from Elder, 1970). The problems facing thefermentation process were indeed very formidable. The problem was typical of most new fermentation processes: a valuable product made at very low levels. The low rate of production per unit volume would necessitatevery large and inefficient reactors, and the low concentration (titer) made product recov-ery and purification very difficult. In 1939 the final concentration in a typical penicillinfermentation broth was one part per million (ca. 0.001 g/l); gold is more plentiful in seawater. Furthermore, penicillin is a fragile and unstable product, which places significantconstraints on the approaches used for recovery and purification. Life scientists at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory made many major contributions to the penicillin program. One was the development of a corn steepliquor-lactose based medium. This medium increased productivity about tenfold. Aworldwide search by the laboratory for better producer strains of Penicillium led to the isolation of a Penicillium chrysogenum strain. This strain, isolated from a moldy can- taloupe at a Peoria fruit market, proved superior to hundreds of other isolates tested. Itsprogeny have been used in almost all commercial penicillin fermentations. The other hurdle was to decide on a manufacturing process. One method involved the growth of the mold on the surface of moist bran. This bran method was discarded be-cause of difficulties in temperature control, sterilization, and equipment size. The surfacemethod involved growth of the mold on top of a quiescent medium. The surface methodused a variety of containers, including milk bottles, and the term \"bottle plant\" indicatedsuch a manufacturing technique. The surface method gave relatively high yields, but had along growing cycle and was very labor intensive. The first manufacturing plants were bot-tle plants because the method worked and could be implemented quickly. However, it was clear that the surface method would not meet the full need for peni- cillin. If the goal of the War Production Board was met by bottle plants, it was estimated Sec. 1.4 The Story of Penicillin: How Biologists and Engineers Work Together 5ch01.cou 10/11/01 4:22 PM Page 5that the necessary bottles would fill a row stretching from New York City to San Fran- cisco. Engineers generally favored a submerged tank process. The submerged process pre-sented challenges in terms of both mold physiology and in tank design and operation.Large volumes of absolutely clean, oil- and dirt-free sterile air were required. What werethen very large agitators were required, and the mechanical seal for the agitator shaft hadto be designed to prevent the entry of organisms. Even today, problems of oxygen supplyand heat removal are important constraints on antibiotic fermenter design. Contaminationby foreign organisms could degrade the product as fast as it was formed, consume nutri-ents before they were converted to penicillin, or produce toxins. 6 What Is a Bioprocess Engineer? Chap. 1 Figure 1.2(a). Series from T.D. Brock, K.M. Brock, and D.M. Ward.

The very fragile nature of penicillin required the develop-ment of special techniques. A combination of pH shifts and rapid liquid-liquid extractionproved useful. Soon processes using tanks of about 10,000 gal were built. Pfizer completed in less than six months the first plant for commercial production of penicillin by submerged fer-mentation (Hobby, 1985). The plant had 14 tanks each of 7000-gal capacity. By a combi-nation of good luck and hard work, the United States had the capacity by the end of WorldWar II to produce enough penicillin for almost 100,000 patients per year (see Figs. 1.2and 1.3). This accomplishment required a high level of multidisciplinary work. For example, Merck realized that men who understood both engineering and biology were not avail-able. Merck assigned a chemical engineer and microbiologist together to each aspect ofthe problem. They planned, executed, and analyzed the experimental program jointly, \"al-most as if they were one man\" (see the chapter by Silcox in Elder, 1970). Progress with penicillin fermentation has continued, as has the need for the interac- tion of biologists and engineers. From 1939 to now, the yield of penicillin has gone from0.001 g/l to over 50 g/l of fermentation broth. Progress has involved better understandingof mold physiology, metabolic pathways, penicillin structure, methods of mutation and se-lection of mold genetics, process control, and reactor design.

With the advent of modern antibiotics, the concept of a bio-process engineer was born. The penicillin process also established a paradigm for bio-process development and biochemical engineering. This paradigm still guides much ofour profession's thinking. The mind set of bioprocess engineers was cast with the peni-cillin experience. It is for this reason that we have focused on the penicillin story, ratherthan on an example for production of a protein from a genetically engineered organism.Although many parallels can be made between the penicillin process and our efforts to userecombinant DNA, no similar paradigm has yet emerged from our experience with geneti-cally engineered cells. We must continually reexamine the prejudices the field has inher-ited from the penicillin experience. It is you, the student, who will best be able to challenge these prejudices. 1.5. BIOPROCESSES: REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS To understand the mind set of a bioprocess engineer you must understand the regulatory climate in which many bioprocess engineers work. The U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Ad-ministration) and its equivalents in other countries must insure the safety and efficacy of 8 What Is a Bioprocess Engineer? Chap. 1 Figure 1.3. Schematic of 10/11/01 4:23 PM Page 8medicines. For bioprocess engineers working in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology in- dustry the primary concern is not reduction of manufacturing cost (although that is still avery desirable goal), but the production of a product of consistently high quality inamounts to satisfy the medical needs of the population. Consider briefly the process by which a drug obtains FDA approval. A typical drug undergoes 6.5 years of development from the discovery stage through preclinical testingin animals. Human clinical trials are conducted in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials(about 1 year) are used to test safety; typically 20 to 80 volunteers are used. Phase II clini-cal trials (about 2 years) use 100 to 300 patients and the emphasis is on efficacy (i.e., doesit help the patient) as well as further determining which side effects exist. Compounds thatare still promising enter phase III clinical trials (about 3 years) with 1000 to 3000 patients.Since individuals vary in body chemistry, it is important to test the range of responses interms of both side effects and efficacy by using a representative cross section of the popu-lation. Data from clinical trials is presented to the FDA for review (about 18 months). Ifthe clinical trials are well designed and demonstrate statistically significant improvementsin health with acceptable side effects, the drug is likely to be approved. Even after thispoint there is continued monitoring of the drug for adverse effects. The whole drugdiscovery-through-approval process takes 15 years on the average and costs about $400million (in 1996). Only one in ten drugs that enter human clinical trials receives approval.Recent FDA reforms have decreased the time to obtain approval for life-saving drugs intreatment of diseases such as cancer and AIDS, but the overall process is still lengthy. This process greatly affects a bioprocess engineer. FDA approval is for the product andthe process together. There have been tragic examples where a small process change has allowed a toxic trace compound to form or become incorporated in the final product,resulting in severe side effects, including death. Thus, process changes may require newclinical trials to test the safety of the resulting product. Since clinical trials are very expen-sive, process improvements are made under a limited set of circumstances. Even duringclinical trials it is difficult to make major process changes. Drugs sold on the market or used in clinical trials must come from facilities that are certified as GMP. GMP stands for good manufacturing practice . GMP concerns the actual manufacturing facility design and layout, the equipment and procedures, training of pro-duction personnel, control of process inputs (e.g., raw materials and cultures), and han-dling of product. The plant layout and design must prevent contamination of the productand dictates the flow of material, personnel, and air. Equipment and procedures must bevalidated . Procedures include not only operation of a piece of equipment, but also clean- ing and sterilization. Computer software used to monitor and control the process must bevalidated. Off-line assays done in laboratories must satisfy good laboratory practices (GLP). Procedures are documented by SOPs ( standard operating procedures ). The GMP guidelines stress the need for documented procedures to validate perfor- mance. \"Process validation is establishing documented evidence which provides a highdegree of assurance that a specific process will consistently produce a product meeting itspredetermined specifications and quality characteristics\" and \"There shall be written pro-cedures for production and process-control to assure that products have the identity,strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess.\" The actual process of doing validation is often complex, particularly when a whole facility design is considered. The FDA provides extensive information and guidelines Sec. 1.5 Bioprocesses: Regulatory Constraints 9ch01.cou 10/11/01 4:23 PM Page 9which are updated regularly. If students become involved in biomanufacturing for phar- maceuticals, they will need to consult these sources. However, certain key concepts do notchange. These concepts are written documentation, consistency of procedures, consis-tency of product, and demonstrable measures of product quality, particularly purity andsafety. These tasks are demanding and require careful attention to detail. Bioprocessengineers will often find that much of their effort will be to satisfy these regulatoryrequirements. The key point is that process changes cannot be made without considering their considerable regulatory impact. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING A. History of Penicillin ELDER , A.

Living cells can be found al- most anywhere that water is in the liquid state. The right temperature, pH, and moisturelevels vary from one organism to another. Some cells can grow at -20\u00b0C (in a brine to prevent freezing), while others can grow at 120\u00b0C (where water is under high enough pressure to prevent boiling). Cells thatgrow best at low temperatures (below 20\u00b0C) are usually called psychrophiles , while those with temperature optima in the range of 20\u00b0 to 50\u00b0C are mesophiles . Organisms that grow best at temperatures greater than 50\u00b0C are thermophiles . Many organisms have pH optima far from neutrality; some prefer pH values down to 1 or 2, while others may grow well at pH 9. Some organisms can grow at low pH valuesand high temperatures. Although most organisms can grow only where water activity is high, others can grow on barely moist solid surfaces or in solutions with high salt concentrations. Some cells require oxygen for growth and metabolism. Such organisms can be termed aerobic . Other organisms are inhibited by the presence of oxygen and grow only2 An Overview of Biological Basicsch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 11anaerobically . Some organisms can switch the metabolic pathways to allow them to grow under either circumstance. Such organisms are facultative . Often organisms can grow in environments with almost no obvious source of nutri- ents. Some cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae) can grow in an environment with only a little moisture and a few dissolved minerals. These bacteria are photosyntheticand can convert CO 2from the atmosphere into the organic compounds necessary for life. They can also convert N2into NH3for use in making the essential building blocks of life. Such organisms are important in colonizing nutrient-deficient environments. Organisms from these extreme environments ( extremophiles ) often provide the human race with important tools for processes to make useful chemicals and medicinals.They are also key to the maintenance of natural cycles and can be used in the recovery ofmetals from low-grade ores or in the desulfurization of coal or other fuels. The fact thatorganisms can develop the capacity to exist and multiply in almost any environment onearth is extremely useful. Not only do organisms occupy a wide variety of habitats, but they also come in a wide range of sizes and shapes. Spherical, cylindrical, ellipsoidal, spiral, and pleomorphiccells exist. Special names are used to describe the shape of bacteria. A cell with a spheri-cal or elliptical shape is often called a coccus (plural, cocci ); a cylindrical cell is a rod or bacillus (plural, bacilli ); a spiral-shaped cell is a spirillum (plural, spirilla ). Some cells may change shape in response to changes in their local environment. Thus, organisms can be found in the most extreme environments and have evolved a wondrous array of shapes, sizes, and metabolic capabilities. This great diversity providesthe engineer with an immense variety of potential tools. We have barely begun to learnhow to exploit these tools. 2.1.2. Naming Cells The situation is complicated by the bewildering variety of organisms present. A system- atic approach to classifying these organisms is an essential aid to their intelligent use. Tax- onomy is the development of approaches to organize and summarize our knowledge about the variety of organisms that exist. Although a knowledge of taxonomy may seem remotefrom the needs of the engineer, it is necessary for efficient communication among engi-neers and scientists working with living cells. Taxonomy can also play a critical role inpatent litigation involving bioprocesses. While taxonomy is concerned with approaches to classification, nomenclature refers to the actual naming of organisms. For microorganisms we use a dual name (binarynomenclature). The names are given in Latin or are Latinized. A genus is a group of re-lated species, while a species includes organisms that are substantially alike. A commongut organism that has been well studied is Escherichia coli. Escherichia is the genus and colithe species. When writing a report or paper, it is common practice to give the full name when the organism is first mentioned, but in subsequent discussion to abbreviate thegenus to the first letter. In this case we would use E. coli . Although organisms that belong to the same species all share the same major characteristics, there are subtle and oftentechnologically important variations within species. An E. coli used in one laboratory may differ from that used in another. Thus, various strains and substrains are designated by the 12 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 12addition of letters and numbers. For example, E. coli B/r A will differ in growth and phys- iological properties from E. coli K12. Now that we know how to name organisms, we could consider broader classifica- tion up to the level of kingdoms. There is no universal agreement on how to classify mi-croorganisms at this level. Such classification is rather arbitrary and need not concern us.However, we must be aware that there are two primary cell types: eucaryotic and procary- otic. The primary difference between them is the presence or absence of a membrane around the cell's genetic information. Procaryotes have a simple structure with a single chromosome. Procaryotic cells have no nuclear membrane and no organelles, such as the mitochondria and endoplasmicreticulum. Eucaryotes have a more complex internal structure, with more than one chro-mosome (DNA molecule) in the nucleus. Eucaryotic cells have a true nuclear membraneand contain mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, and a variety of spe-cialized organelles. We will soon describe each of these components (Section 2.1.5). A de-tailed comparison of procaryotes and eucaryotes is presented in Table 2.1. Structuraldifferences between procaryotes and eucaryotes are discussed later. Recently, it has become obvious that the situation is even more complicated. Evi- dence suggests that a common or universal ancestor gave rise to three distinctive branchesof life: eucaryotes, eubacteria (or \"true\" bacteria), and archaebacteria. Table 2.2 summa-rizes some of the distinctive features of these groups. The ability to sequence the genes ofwhole organisms will have a great impact on our understanding of how these familiesevolved and are related. Viruses cannot be classified under any of these categories, as they are not free-living organisms. Let's consider first some of the characteristics of these rather simple\"organisms.\" Sec. 2.1 Are All Cells the Same? 13TABLE 2.1 A Comparison of Procaryotes with Eucaryotes Characteristic Procaryotes Eucaryotes Genome No. of DNA molecules One More than oneDNA in organelles No YesDNA observed as chromosomes No YesNuclear membrane No YesMitotic and meiotic division of the nucleus No YesFormation of partial diploid Yes No Organelles Mitochondria No YesPhotosynthetic apparatus Chlorosomes ChloroplastsFlagella Single protein, simple Complex structure, with structure microtubules Spores Endospores Endo- and exospores Heat resistance High Low With permission, from N.

Viruses Viruses are very small and are obligate parasites of other cells, such as bacterial, yeast, plant, and animal cells. Viruses cannot capture or store free energy and are not function-ally active except when inside their host cells. The sizes of viruses vary from 30 to 200nanometers (nm). Viruses contain either DNA (DNA viruses) or RNA (RNA viruses) asgenetic material. DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, and RNA is ribonucleic acid; wewill soon discuss these molecules in more detail. In free-living cells, all genetic informa-tion is contained on the DNA, whereas viruses can use either RNA or DNA to encodesuch information. This nuclear material is covered by a protein coat called a capsid . Some viruses have an outer envelope of a lipoprotein and some do not. Almost all cell types are susceptible to viral infections. Viruses infecting bacteria are called bacteriophages . Some bacteriophages have a hexagonal head, tail, and tail fibers. Bacteriophages attach to the cell wall of a host cell with tail fibers, alter the cellwall of the host cell, and inject the viral nuclear material into the host cell. Figure 2.1 de-scribes the attachment of a virus onto a host cell. Bacteriophage nucleic acids reproduceinside the host cells to produce more phages. At a certain stage of viral reproduction, hostcells lyse or break apart and phage particles are released, which can infect new host cells.This mode of reproduction of viruses is called the lytic cycle . In some cases, phage DNA may be incorporated into the host DNA, and the host may continue to multiply in thisstate, which is called the lysogenic cycle . Viruses are the cause of many diseases, and antiviral agents are important targets for drug discovery. Additionally, viruses are directly important to bioprocess technology. Forexample, a phage attack on an E. coli fermentation to make a recombinant protein product can be extremely destructive, causing the loss of the whole culture in vessels of manythousands of liters. However, phages can be used as agents to move desired genetic mater-ial into E. coli . Modified animal viruses can be used as vectors in genetically engineering animal cells to produce proteins from recombinant DNA technology. In some cases akilled virus preparation is used as a vaccine. In other cases genetic engineering allowsproduction of viruslike particles that are empty shells; the shell is the capsid and allnucleic acid is removed. Such particles can be used as vaccines without fear of viral repli-cation, since all of the genetic material has been removed. For gene therapy one approach 14 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2TABLE 2.2 Primary Subdivisions of Cellular Organisms That Are Now Recognized Group Cell structure Properties Constituent groups Eucaryotes Eucaryotic Multicellular; extensive differ- Plants (seed plants, or Protists (algae, or no tissue differentiation Eubacteria Procaryotic Cell chemistry similar to Most bacteria Distinctive cell chemistry Methanogens, from R.

The viral capsid can act as a Trojan Horse to protect the desiredgene in a hostile environment and then to deliver it selectively to a particle cell type. Thus,viruses can do great harm but also are important biotechnological tools. 2.1.4. Procaryotes The sizes of most procaryotes vary from 0.5 to 3 micrometers ( mm) in equivalent radius. Different species have different shapes, such as spherical or coccus (e.g., Staphylococci ), cylindrical or spirillum ( Rhodospirillum ). Procaryotic cells grow rapidly, with typical doubling times of one-half hour to several hours. Also, procary-otes can utilize a variety of nutrients as carbon source, including carbohydrates, hydrocar-bons, proteins, and CO 2. 2.1.4.1. Eubacteria. The Eubacteria can be divided into several different groups. One distinction is based on the gram stain (developed by Hans Christian Gram in1884). The staining procedure first requires fixing the cells by heating. The basic dye,crystal violet, is added; all bacteria will stain purple. Next, iodine is added, followed by Sec. 2.1 Are All Cells the Same? 15 Figure 2.1. Replication of a virulent bacteriophage. A virulent phage undergoes a lytic cycle to produce new phage particles within a bacterial cell. Cell lysis releases new phage particles that can infect more bacteria. (With permission, from J. G.

Gram-positive cells remain purple, while gram-negative cells be- come colorless. Finally, counterstaining with safranin leaves gram-positive cells purple,while gram-negative cells are red. This ability to react with the gram stain reveals intrinsicdifferences in the structure of the cell envelope. A typical gram-negative cell is E. coli (see Fig. 2.2). It has an outer membrane sup- ported by a thin peptidoglycan layer. Peptidoglycan is a complex polysaccharide with amino acids and forms a structure somewhat analogous to a chain-link fence. A secondmembrane (the inner or cytoplasmic membrane ) exists and is separated from the outer membrane by the periplasmic space . The cytoplasmic membrane contains about 50% pro- tein, 30% lipids, and 20% carbohydrates. The cell envelope serves to retain importantcellular compounds and to preferentially exclude undesirable compounds in the environ-ment. Loss of membrane integrity leads to cell lysis (cells breaking open) and cell death. The cell envelope is crucial to the transport of selected material in and out of the cell. A typical gram-positive cell is Bacillus subtilis . Gram-positive cells do not have an outer membrane. Rather they have a very thick, rigid cell wall with multiple layers of pep-tidoglycan. Gram-positive cells also contain teichoic acids covalently bonded to the pepti- doglycan. Because gram-positive bacteria have only a cytoplasmic membrane, they areoften much better suited to excretion of proteins. Such excretion can be technologicallyadvantageous when the protein is a desired product. Some bacteria are not gram-positive or gram-negative. For example, the Myco- plasma have no cell walls. These bacteria are important not only clinically (e.g., primary atypical pneumonia), but also because they commonly contaminate media used industri-ally for animal cell culture. 16 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2 Figure 2.2. Schematic of a typical gram-negative bacterium ( E. coli ). A gram-positive cell would be similar, except that it would have no outer membrane, its peptidoglycanlayer would be thicker, and the chemical composition of the cell wall would differ signifi-cantly from the outer envelope of the gram-negative cell.ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 16Actinomycetes are bacteria, but, morphologically, actinomycetes resemble molds with their long and highly branched hyphae. However, the lack of a nuclear membrane andthe composition of the cell wall require classification as bacteria. Actinomycetes are impor-tant sources of antibiotics. Certain Actinomycetes possess amylolytic and cellulolytic en-zymes and are effective starch and cellulose. Actinomyces, Thermomonospora , and Streptomyces are examples of genera belonging to this group. Other distinctions within the eubacteria can be made based on cellular nutrition and energy metabolism. One important example is photosynthesis. The cyanobacteria (for-merly called blue-green algae) have chlorophyll and fix CO 2into sugars. Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (the purple and green bacteria) have light-gathering pigmentscalled bacteriochlorophyll . Unlike true photosynthesis, the purple and green bacteria do not obtain reducing power from the splitting of water and do not form oxygen. When stained properly, the area occupied by the procaryotic cell's DNA can be eas- ily seen. Procaryotes may also have other visible structures when viewed under the micro-scope, such as ribosomes, storage granules, spores , and volutins . Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. A typical bacterial cell contains approximately 10,000 ribosomes percell, although this number can vary greatly with growth rate. The size of a typical ribo-some is 10 to 20 nm and consists of approximately 63% RNA and 37% protein. Storagegranules (which are not present in every bacterium) can be used as a source of keymetabolites and often contain polysaccharides, lipids, and sulfur granules. The sizes ofstorage granules vary between 0.5 and 1 mm. Some bacteria make intracellular spores (often called endospores in bacteria). Bac- terial spores are produced as a resistance to adverse conditions such as high temperature,radiation, and toxic chemicals. The usual concentration is 1 spore per cell, with a sporesize of about 1 mm. Spores can germinate under favorable growth conditions to yield ac- tively growing bacteria. V olutin is another granular intracellular structure, made of inorganic polymetaphos- phates, that is present in some species. Some photosynthetic bacteria, such as Rhodospir- illum , have chromatophores that are large inclusion bodies (50 to 100 nm) utilized in photosynthesis for the absorption of light. Extracellular products can adhere to or become incorporated within the surface of the cell. Certain bacteria have a coating or outside cell wall called capsule , which is usu- ally a polysaccharide or sometimes a polypeptide. Extracellular polymers are important tobiofilm formation and response to environmental challenges (e.g., viruses). Table 2.3summarizes the architecture of most bacteria. 2.1.4.2. Archaebacteria. The archaebacteria appear under the microscope to be nearly identical to many of the eubacteria. However, these cells differ greatly at themolecular level. In many ways the archaebacteria are as similar to the eucaryotes as theyare to the eubacteria. Some examples of differences between archaebacteria and eubac-teria follows: nucleotide in the ribosomal RNA are similar within the archaebacte- ria but distinctly different from eubacteria. 3.The lipid composition of the cytoplasmic membrane is very different for the two groups.

Millis, Biochemical Engineering , 2d 10:46 PM Page 18The archaebacteria usually live in extreme environments and possess unusual me- tabolism. Methanogens, which are methane-producing bacteria, belong to this group, aswell as the thermoacidophiles. The thermoacidophiles can grow at high temperatures andlow pH values. The halobacteria, which can live only in very strong salt solutions, aremembers of this group. These organisms are important sources for catalytically activeproteins (enzymes) with novel properties. 2.1.5. EucaryotesFungi (yeasts and molds), algae, protozoa, and animal and plant cells constitute the eu- caryotes. Eucaryotes are five to ten times larger than procaryotes in diameter (e.g., yeastabout 5 mm, animal cells about 10 mm, and plants about 20 mm). Eucaryotes have a true nucleus and a number of cellular organelles inside the cytoplasma. Figure 2.3 is aschematic of two typical eucaryotic cells. In cell wall and cell membrane structure, eucaryotes are similar to procaryotes. The plasma membrane is made of proteins and phospholipids that form a bilayer structure.Major proteins of the membrane are hydrophobic and are embedded in the phospholipidmatrix. One major difference is the presence of sterols in the cytoplasmic membrane ofeucaryotes. Sterols strengthen the structure and make the membrane less flexible. The cellwall of eucaryotic cells shows considerable variations. Some eucaryotes have a peptido-glycan layer in their cell wall; some have polysaccharides and cellulose (e.g., algae). Theplant cell wall is composed of cellulose fibers embedded in pectin aggregates, which im-part strength to the cell wall. Animal cells do not have a cell wall but only a cytoplasmicmembrane. For this reason, animal cells are very shear-sensitive and fragile. This factorsignificantly complicates the design of large-scale bioreactors for animal cells. Sec. 2.1 Are All Cells the Same? 19 Figure 2.3. Sketches of the two primary types of higher eucaryotic cells. Neither sketch is complete, but each summarizes the principal differences and similarities of such cells.ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 19The nucleus of eucaryotic cells contains chromosomes as nuclear material (DNA molecules with some closely associated small proteins), surrounded by a membrane. Thenuclear membrane consists of a pair of concentric and porous membranes. The nucleolusis an area in the nucleus that stains differently and is the site of ribosome synthesis. How-ever, many chromosomes contain small amounts of RNA and basic proteins called his- tones attached to the DNA. Each chromosome contains a single linear DNA molecule on which the histones are attached. Cell division (asexual) in eucaryotes involves several major steps, such as DNA synthesis, nuclear division, cell division, and cell separation. Sexual reproduction in eu-caryotic cells involves the conjugation of two cells called gametes (egg and sperm cells). The single cell formed from the conjugation of gametes is called a zygote . The zygote has twice as many chromosomes as does the gamete. Gametes are haploid cells, while zygotes are diploid . For humans, a haploid cell contains 23 chromosomes, and diploid cells have 46. The cell-division cycle (asexual reproduction) in a eucaryotic cell is depicted in Fig. 2.4. The cell-division cycle is divided into four phases. The M phase consists of mitosis where the nucleous divides, and cytokinesis where the cell splits into separate daughter cells. All of the phases between one M phase and the next are known collectively as theinterphase . The interphase is divided into three phases: G 1, S, and G2. The cell increases in size during the interphase period. In the S phase the cell replicates its nuclear DNA.There are key checkpoints in the cycle when the cell machinery must commit to entry tothe next phase. Checkpoints exist for entry into the S and M phases and exit from M phase. Cells may also be in a G 0state, which is a resting state where there is no growth. The mitochondria are the powerhouses of a eucaryotic cell, where respiration and oxidative phosphorylation take place. Mitochondria have a nearly cylindrical shape 1 mm in diameter and 2 to 3 mm in length. The typical structure of a mitochondrion is shown in 20 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2 Figure 2.4. Schematic of cell division cycle in an eucaryote. (See text for details.)ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 20Fig. 2.5. The external membrane is made of a phospholipid bilayer with proteins embed- ded in the lipid matrix. The mitochondria contain a complex system of inner membranescalled cristae . A gellike matrix containing large amounts of protein fills the space inside the cristae. Some enzymes of oxidative respiration are bound to the cristae. A mitochon-drion has its own DNA and protein-synthesizing machinery and reproduces indepen-dently. The endoplasmic reticulum is a complex, convoluted membrane system leading from the cell membrane into the cell. The rough endoplasmic reticulum contains ribo-somes on the inner surfaces and is the site of protein synthesis and modifications of pro-tein structure after synthesis. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is more involved withlipid synthesis. Lysosomes are very small membrane-bound particles that contain and release diges- tive enzymes. Lysosomes contribute to the digestion of nutrients and invading substances. Peroxisomes are similar to lysosomes in their structure, but not in function. Peroxi- somes carry out oxidative reactions that produce hydrogen peroxide. Glyoxysomes are also very small membrane-bound particles that contain the en- zymes of the glyoxylate cycle. Golgi bodies are very small particles composed of membrane aggregates and are re- sponsible for the secretion of certain proteins. Golgi bodies are sites where proteins aremodified by the addition of various sugars in a process called glycosylation . Such modifi- cations are important to protein function in the body. Vacuoles are membrane-bound organelles of low density and are responsible for food digestion, osmotic regulation, and waste-product storage. Vacuoles may occupy alarge fraction of cell volume (up to 90% in plant cells). Sec. 2.1 Are All Cells the Same? 21 Figure 2.5. Diagram of a mitochondrion.

Chlorophyll molecules are associated with thylakoids, which have a regular membrane structure with lipid bilayers. Chloroplasts are autonomous units con-taining their own DNA and protein-synthesizing machinery. Certain procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms contain flagella \u2014long, filamentous structures that are attached to one end of the cell and are responsible for the motion of thecell. Eucaryotic flagella contain two central fibers surrounded by eighteen peripheralfibers, which exist in doublets. Fibers are in a tube structure called a microtubule and are composed of proteins called tubulin. The whole fiber assembly is embedded in an organicmatrix and is surrounded by a membrane. The cytoskeleton (in eucaryotic cells) refers to filaments that provide an internal framework to organize the cell's internal activities and control its shape. These filamentsare critical in cell movement, transduction of mechanical forces into biological responses,and separation of chromosomes into the two daughter cells during cell division. Threetypes of fibers are present: actin filaments, intermediate filaments , and microtubules . Cilia are flagellalike structures, but are numerous and shorter. Only one group of protozoa, called ciliates, contains cilia. Paramecium species contain nearly 10 4cilia per cell. Ciliated organisms move much faster than flagellated ones. This completes our summary of eucaryotic cell structure. Now let us turn our atten- tion to the microscopic eucaryotes. Fungi are heterotrophs that are widespread in nature. Fungal cells are larger than bacterial cells, and their typical internal structures, such as nucleus and vacuoles, can beseen easily with a light microscope. Two major groups of fungi are yeasts and molds. Yeasts are single small cells of 5- to 10- mm size. Yeast cells are usually spherical, cylindrical, or oval. Yeasts can reproduce by asexual or sexual means. Asexual reproduc-tion is by either budding or fission. In budding, a small bud cell forms on the cell, whichgradually enlarges and separates from the mother cell. Asexual reproduction by fission is similar to that of bacteria. Only a few species of yeast can reproduce by fission. In fission,cells grow to a certain size and divide into two equal cells. Sexual reproduction of yeastsinvolves the formation of a zygote (a diploid cell) from fusion of two haploid cells, each having a single set of chromosomes. The nucleus of the diploid cells divides several timesto form ascospores . Each ascospore eventually becomes a new haploid cell and may re- produce by budding and fission. The life cycle of a typical yeast cell is presented in Fig. 2.6. The classification of yeasts is based on reproductive modes (e.g., budding or fission ) and the nutritional requirements of cells. The most widely used yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae , is used in alcohol formation under anaerobic conditions (e.g., in wine, beer and whiskey making) and also for baker's yeast production under aerobic conditions. Molds are filamentous fungi and have a mycelial structure. The mycelium is a highly branched system of tubes that contains mobil cytoplasm with many nuclei. Long, thin fila-ments on the mycelium are called hyphae . Certain branches of mycelium may grow in the air, and asexual spores called conidia are formed on these aerial branches. Conidia are nearly spherical in structure and are often pigmented. Some molds reproduce by sexualmeans and form sexual spores. These spores provide resistance against heat, freezing, 22 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 22drying, and some chemical agents. Both sexual and asexual spores of molds can germi- nate and form new hyphae. Figure 2.7 describes the structure and asexual reproduction ofmolds. Molds usually form long, highly branched cells and easily grow on moist, solid nu- trient surfaces. The typical size of a filamentous form of mold is 5 to 20 mm. When grown in submerged culture, molds often form cell aggregates and pellets. The typical size of amold pellet varies between 50 mm and 1 mm, depending on the type of mold and growth conditions. Pellet formation can cause some nutrient-transfer (mainly oxygen) problemsinside the pellet. However, pellet formation reduces broth viscosity, which can improvebulk oxygen transfer. On the basis of their mode of sexual reproduction, fungi are grouped in four classes. 1.The phycomycetes are algalike fungi; however, they do not possess chlorophyll and cannot photosynthesize. Aquatic and terrestrial molds belong to this category. 2.The ascomycetes form sexual spores called ascospores, which are contained within a sac (a capsule structure). Some molds of the genera Neurospora and Aspergillus and yeasts belong to this category. 3.The basidiomycetes reproduce by basidiospores, which are extended from the stalks of specialized cells called the basidia. Mushrooms are basidiomycetes. Sec. 2.1 Are All Cells the Same? 23 Figure 2.6. Cell-division cycle of a typical yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae . (With per- mission, from T. D. Brock, D. W.

Only asexually reproducing molds belong to this category. Some pathogenic fungi, suchas Trichophyton , which causes athlete's foot, belong to the deuteromycetes. Molds are used for the production of citric acid ( Aspergillus niger ) and many penicillin ( Penicillium chrysogenum ). Mold fermentations make up a large frac- tion of the fermentation industry. Algae are usually unicellular organisms. However, some plantlike multicellular structures are present in marine waters. All algae are photosynthetic and contain chloro-plasts, which normally impart a green color to the organisms. The chloroplasts are thesites of chlorophyll pigments and are responsible for photosynthesis. The size of a typicalunicellular alga is 10 to 30 mm. Multicellular algae sometimes form a branched or un- branched filamentous structure. Some algae contain silica or calcium carbonate in theircell wall. Diatoms containing silica in their cell wall are used as filter aids in industry.Some algae, such as Chlorella, Scenedesmus, Spirullina , and are used treatment with simultaneous single-cell protein production. Certain gellingagents such as agar and alginic acid are obtained from marine algae and seaweeds. Somealgae are brown or red because of the presence of other pigments. Protozoa are unicellular, motile, relatively large (1 mm to 50 mm) eucaryotic cells that lack cell walls. Protozoa usually obtain food by ingesting other small organisms, suchas bacteria, or other food particles. Protozoa are usually uninucleate and reproduce bysexual or asexual means. They are classified on the basis of their motion. The amoebae move by ameboid motion, whereby the cytoplasm of the cell flows forward to form apseudopodium (false foot), and the rest of the cell flows toward this lobe. The flagellates 24 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2 Figure 2.7. Structure and asexual reproduction of molds. (With permission, from T. D. Brock, K. M. Brock, and D. M.

Trypanosomes move by flagella and cause a number of diseases in humans. The ciliates move by motion of a large number of small appendages on the cell surface called cilia. The sporozoans are nonmotile and contain members that are human and animal parasites. These protozoa do not engulf food particles, but absorb dis-solved food components through their membranes. Protozoa cause some diseases, such asmalaria and dysentery. Protozoa may have a beneficial role in removing bacteria fromwaste water in biological waste-water treatment processes and helping to obtain clean ef-fluents. Microscopic pictures of some protozoa are presented in Fig. 2.8. 2.2. CELL CONSTRUCTION 2.2.1. IntroductionLiving cells are composed of high-molecular-weight polymeric compounds such as pro- teins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, lipids, and other storage materials (fats, polyhydroxy-butyrate, glycogen).

For example, a typical bacterial cell wall contains polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids; cell cytoplasm contains proteins mostly in the form of enzymes; in eucaryotes, thecell nucleus contains nucleic acids mostly in the form of DNA. In addition to thesebiopolymers, cells contain other metabolites in the form of inorganic salts (e.g., NH vita- mins. The elemental composition of a typical bacterial cell is 50% carbon, 20% oxygen,14% nitrogen, 8% hydrogen, 3% phosphorus, and 1% amounts of K +, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, and vitamins. The cellular macromolecules are functional only when in the proper three-dimen- sional configuration. The interaction among them is very complicated. Each macromole-cule is part of an intracellular organelle and functions in its unique microenvironment.Information transfer from one organelle to another (e.g., from nucleus to ribosomes) ismediated by special molecules (e.g., messenger RNA). Most of the enzymes and meta-bolic intermediates are present in cytoplasm. However, other organelles, such as mito-chondria, contain enzymes and other metabolites. A living cell can be visualized as a verycomplex reactor in which more than 2000 reactions take place. These reactions (metabolicpathways) are interrelated and are controlled in a complicated fashion. Despite all their complexity, an understanding of biological systems can be sim- plified by analyzing the system at several different levels: molecular level (molecularbiology, biochemistry); cellular level (cell biology, microbiology); population level (mi-crobiology, ecology); and production level (bioprocess engineering). This section is de-voted mainly to the structure and function of biological molecules. 2.2.2. Amino Acids and ProteinsProteins are the most abundant organic molecules in living cells, constituting 40% to 70% of their dry weight. Proteins are polymers built from amino acid monomers. Proteins typi-cally have molecular weights of 6000 to several hundred thousand. The a-amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and contain at least one carboxyl group and one a-amino group, but they differ from each other in the structure of their R groups or side chains. 26 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2 Although the sequence of amino acids determines a protein's primary structure, the secondary and tertiary structure are determined by the weak interactions among the vari- ous side groups. The ultimate three-dimensional structure is critical to the biological ac-tivity of the protein. Two major types of protein conformation are (1) fibrous proteins and(2) globular proteins. Figure 2.9 depicts examples of fibrous and globular proteins. Pro-teins have diverse biological functions, which can be classified in five major 5.Protective proteins: antibodies, thrombin The enzymes represent the largest class of proteins. Over 2000 different kinds of en- zymes are known. Enzymes are highly specific in their function and have extraordinarycatalytic power. Each enzyme's molecule contains an active site to which its specific sub- strate is bound during catalysis. Some enzymes are regulated and are called regulatory en- zymes. Most enzymes are globular proteins. Sec. 2.2 Cell Construction 27 Figure 2.9. Fibrous and globular proteins. (With permission, from A. Lehninger, Bio- chemistry , 2d ed., Worth Publishing, New York, 1975, p. 61.)ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 27The building blocks of proteins are a-amino acids, and there are 20 common amino acids. Amino acids are named on the basis of the side (R) group attached to the a-carbon. Amino acids are optically active and occur in two isomeric forms. 28 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2 Only L-amino acids are found in proteins. D-amino acids are rare in nature; they are found in the cell walls of some microorganisms and in some antibiotics. Amino acids have acidic (\u2014COOH) and basic (\u2014NH2) groups. The acidic group is neutral at low pH (\u2014COOH) and negatively charged at high pH (\u2014COO-). At intermedi- ate pH values, an amino acid has positively and negatively charged groups, a dipolar mol-ecule called a zwitterion . The pH value at which amino acids have no net charge is called the isoelectric point , which varies depending on the R group of amino acids. At its isoelectric point, an amino acid does not migrate under the influence of an electric field. Knowledge of theisoelectric point can be used in developing processes for protein purification. A list of 21amino acids that are commonly found in proteins is given in Table 2.4. The proteins are amino acid chains. The condensation reaction between two amino acids results in the formation of a peptide bond . The peptide bond is planar. Peptides contain two or more amino acids linked by pep- tide bonds. Polypeptides usually contain fewer than 50 amino acids. Larger amino acidchains are called proteins . Many proteins contain organic and/or inorganic components other than amino acids. These components are called prosthetic groups , and the proteins containing prosthetic groups are named conjugated proteins . Hemoglobin is a conjugated protein and has heme groups, which are iron-containing organometallic complexes.(2.1)ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 28Sec. 2.2 Cell Construction 29TABLE 2.4 Chemical Structure of 21 Amino Acids of the General Structure R Group Name Abbreviation Symbol Class \u2014H Glycine GLY G Aliphatic \u2014CH3 amides Cystine \u2014 Disulfide The three-dimensional structure of proteins can be described at four different levels. 1.Primary structure: The primary structure of a protein is its linear sequence of amino acids. Each protein has not only a definite amino acid composition, but also aunique sequence. The one-dimensional structure of proteins (the amino acid sequence)has a profound effect on the resulting three-dimensional structure and, therefore, on thefunction of proteins. ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 292.Secondary structure : This is the way the polypeptide chain is extended and is a result of hydrogen bonding between residues not widely separated. Two major types ofsecondary structure are (a) helixes and (b) sheets. Helical structure can be either a-helical or triple helix. In an a-helical structure, hydrogen bonding can occur between the a-carboxyl group of one residue and the \u2014NH group of its neighbor four units down the chain, as shown in Fig. 2.10. The triple-helix structure present in collagen consists of threea-helixes intertwined in a superhelix. Triple-helix structure is rigid and stretch resistant. The a-helical structure can be easily disturbed, since H bonds are not highly stable. How- ever, the sheet structure ( b-pleated sheet) is more stable. The hydrogen bonds between par- allel chains stabilize the sheet structure and provide resistance to stretching (Fig. 2.11). 3.Tertiary structure: This is a result of interactions between R groups widely sepa- rated along the chain. The folding or bending of an amino acid chain induced byinteraction between R groups determines the tertiary structure of proteins. R groups mayinteract by covalent, disulfide, or hydrogen bonds. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic interac-tions may also be present among R groups. The disulfide bond can cross-link twopolypeptide chains (for example, insulin). Disulfide bonds are also critical in proper chainfolding, as shown in Fig. 2.12. The tertiary structure of a protein has a profound effect onits function. 4.Quaternary structure: Only proteins with more than one polypeptide chain have quaternary structure. Interactions among polypeptide chains determine the quaternarystructure (Fig. 2.9). Hemoglobin has four subunits (oligomeric), and interaction among 30 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2 Figure 2.10. The a-helical structure Page 30these subunits results in a quaternary structure. The forces between polypeptide chains can be disulfide bonds or other weak interactions. The subunit structure of enzymes hasan important role in the control of their catalytic activity. Antibodies or immunoglobulins are proteins that bind to particular molecules or por- tions of large molecules with a high degree of specificity. Antibody (Ab) molecules ap-pear in the blood serum and in certain cells of a vertebrate in response to foreignmacromolecules. The foreign macromolecule is called the antigen (Ag) . The specific anti- body molecules can combine with the antigen to form an antigen-antibody complex . The complex formation between Ag and Ab is called the immune response . In addition to their obvious clinical importance, antibodies are important industrial products for use in diag-nostic kits and protein separation schemes. Antibodies may also become a key element inthe delivery of some anticancer drugs. Antibodies have emerged as one of the most impor-tant products of biotechnology. Antibody molecules have binding sites that are specific for and complementary to the structural features of the antigen. Antibody molecules usually have two binding sitesand can form a three-dimensional lattice of alternating antigen and antibody molecules.This complex precipitates from the serum and is called precipitin . Antibodies are highly specific for the foreign proteins that induce their formation. Sec. 2.2 Cell Construction 31 Figure 2.11. Representation of an antiparallel b-pleated sheet.

Molecular weights of immunoglobulins are about 150 kilodaltons (kD) except forIgM, which has a molecular weight of 900 kD. A dalton is a unit of mass equivalent to a hydrogen atom. Immunoglobulins have four polypeptide chains: two heavy (H) chains(about 430 amino acids) and two light (L) chains (about 214 amino acids). These chainsare linked together by disulfide bonds into a Y-shaped, flexible structure (Fig. 2.13). Theheavy chains contain a covalently bound oligosaccharide component. Each chain has a re-gion of constant amino acid sequence and a variable-sequence region. The Ab moleculehas two binding sites for the antigen; the variable portions of the L and H chains Sec. 2.2 Cell Construction 33 Figure 2.13. Structure of immunoglobulin G (IgG).

The variable sections have hypervariable regions in which the frequency of amino acid replacement is high. The study of how cells developand produce antibodies is being actively pursued worldwide. Recent developments havealso led to insights on how to impart catalytic activities to antibodies. These moleculeshave been called abzymes . Coupling new developments in protein engineering to antibod- ies promises the development of extremely specific catalytic agents. 2.2.3. Carbohydrates: Mono- and PolysaccharidesCarbohydrates play key roles as structural and storage compounds in cells. They also ap- pear to play critical roles in modulating some aspects of chemical signaling in animalsand plants. Carbohydrates are represented by the general formula (CH 2O)n, where n3, and are synthesized through photosynthesis. 34 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2 The gases CO2and H2O are converted through photosynthesis into sugars in the presence of sunlight and are then polymerized to yield polysaccharides, such as cellulose or starch. Monosaccharides are the smallest carbohydrates and contain three to nine carbon atoms. Common monosaccharides are presented in Table 2.5. Common monosaccharidesare either aldehydes or ketones. For example, glucose is an aldohexose. Glucose may bepresent in the form of a linear or ring structure. In solution, D-glucose is in the form of a ring (pyranose) structure. The L-form plays a minor role in biological systems. ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 34Sec. Monosaccharides ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page important group of monosaccharides are D-ribose and deoxyribose. These are five carbon ring-structured sugar molecules and are essential components ofDNA and RNA. 36 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2TABLE 2.5 (Continued ) Disaccharides are formed by the condensation of two monosaccharides. For exam- ple, maltose is formed by the condensation of two glucose molecules via a-1,4 glycosidic linkage. Sucrose is a disaccharide and b-D-galactose.ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 36Lactose is found in milk and whey, while sucrose is the major sugar in photosyn- thetic plants. Whey utilization remains an important biotechnological challenge, and su-crose is often a major component in artificial growth media. Polysaccharides are formed by the condensation of more than two monosaccharides by glycosidic bonds. The polysaccharide processing industry makes extensive use of en-zymatic processing and biochemical engineering. Amylose is a straight chain of glucose molecules linked by a-1,4 glycosidic link- ages. The molecular weight (MW) of amylose is between several thousand and one-halfmillion daltons. Sec. 2.2 Cell Construction 37 Amylose is water insoluble and constitutes about 20 %of starch. Amylopectin is a branched chain of D-glucose molecules. Branching occurs be- tween the glycosidic\u2014OH of one chain and the \u20146 carbon of another glucose, which iscalled a-1,6 glycosidic linkage.ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 37Amylopectin molecules much larger than those of amylose, with a MW of 1 to 2 mil- lion daltons. Amylopectin is water soluble. Partial hydrolysis of starch (acidic or enzy-matic) yields glucose, maltose, and dextrins, which are branched sections of amylopectin.Dextrins are used as thickeners. Glycogen is a branched chain of glucose molecules that resembles amylopectin. Glycogen is highly branched and contains about 12 glucose units in straight-chain seg-ments. The MW of a typical glycogen molecule is less than 5 \u00a510 6daltons. Cellulose is a long, unbranched chain of D-glucose with a MW between 50,000 and 1 million daltons. The linkage between glucose monomers in cellulose is a b-1,4 glyco- sidic linkage. 38 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2 The b-1,4 glycosidic bond is resistant to enzymatic Only a few microorgan- isms can hydrolyze b-1,4 glycosidic bonds of cellulose. a-1,4 glycosidic bonds in starch or glycogen are relatively easy to break by enzymatic or acid hydrolysis. Efficient cellu-lose hydrolysis remains one of the most challenging problems in attempts to convert cel-lulosic wastes into fuels or chemicals. 2.2.4. Lipids, Fats, and SteroidsLipids are hydrophobic biological compounds that are insoluble in water, but soluble in nonpolar solvents such as benzene, chloroform, and ether. They are usually present in thenonaqueous biological phases, such as plasma membranes. Fats are lipids that can serveas biological fuel-storage molecules. Lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides are other typesof lipids, which appear in the biological membranes of cells. Cells can alter the mix oflipids in their membranes to compensate (at least partially) for changes in temperature orto increase their tolerance to the presence of chemical agents such as ethanol. The major component in most lipids is fatty acids , which are made of a straight chain of hydrocarbon (hydrophobic) groups, with a carboxyl group (hydrophilic) at theend. A typical fatty acid represented COOH3__()__ 2nch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 38The nis typically between 12 and 20. Unsaturated fatty acids contain double \u2014C =C\u2014 bonds, such as oleic acid. A list of common fatty acids is presented in Table 2.6. The hydrocarbon chain of a fatty acid is hydrophobic (water insoluble), but the carboxyl group is hydrophilic (watersoluble). Fats are esters of fatty acids with glycerol. The formation of a fat molecule can be represented by the following reaction:Oleic Cell Construction 39TABLE 2.6 Examples of Common Fatty Acids Acid Structure Saturated fatty acids Acetic acid PM Page 39Phosphoglycerides have similar structures to fats, the only difference being that phosphoric acid replaces a fatty acid and is esterified at one end to glycerol. Membranes with selective permeability are key to life. Cells must control the entry and exit of molecules. Phospholipids are key components, but membranes contain large amounts of proteins. Biological membranes are based on a lipid bilayer. The hydrophobictails of the phospholipids associate with each other in the core of the membrane. The hy-drophilic heads form the outsides of the membrane and associate with the aqueous cytosolor the aqueous extracellular fluid. Some proteins span across the membrane, while othersare attached to one of the surfaces. Membranes are dynamic structures, and lipids and pro-teins can diffuse rapidly. Typical membrane phospholipids include phosphatidyl glycerol, and phosphatidyl inositol. Another class lipids of increasing technological importance is the polyhydroxy- alkanoates (PHA). In particular, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a good example. It can be used to form a clear, biodegradable polymeric sheet. Polymers with a variety of PHAs arebeing commercially developed. In some cells PHB is formed as a storage product. Steroids can also be classified as lipids. Naturally occurring steroids are hormones that are important regulators of animal development and metabolism at very low concentrations(for example, 10 -8M). A well-known steroid, cholesterol, is present in membranes of animal tissues. Figure 2.14 depicts the structures of some important steroids. Cortisone is an anti-inflammatory used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and some skin diseases. Derivatives of es-trogens and progesterone are used as contraceptives. The commercial production of steroidsis very important and depends on microbial conversions. Because of the large number ofasymmetric centers, the total synthesis of steroids is difficult. Plants provide a source ofabundant lipid precursors for these steroids, but the highly specific hydroxylation of thesesubstrates at positions 11 (and 16) or dehydrogenations at position 1 are necessary to convertthe precursors into compounds similar to those made in the adrenal gland. This cannot bedone easily with chemical means and is done commercially using microbes that contain en-zymes mediating specific hydroxylations or dehydrogenations. 2.2.5. Nucleic Acids, RNA, and DNA Nucleic acids play the central role in reproduction of living cells. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) stores and preserves genetic information. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a central role in protein synthesis. Both DNA and RNA are large polymers made of their corre-sponding nucleotides. 40 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2 ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 40Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA and also serve as molecules to store energy and reducing power. The three major components in all nucleotides arephosphoric acid, pentose (ribose or deoxyribose), and a base or pyrimidine). Fig-ure 2.15 depicts the structure of nucleotides and purine-pyrimidine bases. Two majorpurines present in nucleotides are adenine (A) and guanine (G), and three major pyrim-idines are thymine (T), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) con-tains A, T, G, and C, and ribonucleic acid (RNA) contains A, U, G, and C as bases. It isthe base sequence in DNA that carries genetic information for protein synthesis. In Chap-ters 4 and 8 we discuss how this information is expressed and passed on from one genera-tion to another. In Chapter 5 we will discuss further the role of nucleotides in cellular energetics. The triphosphates of adenosine and to a lesser extent guanosine are the primary energycurrency of the cell. The phosphate bonds in ATP ) and GTP (guanosine triphosphate ) are high-energy The formation of these phosphate bonds or their hydrolysis is the primary means by which cellular energy is stored or used. Forexample, the synthesis of a compound that is thermodynamically unfavorable can be Sec. 2.2 Cell Construction 41 Figure 2.14. Examples of important steroids.

The coupled reaction can proceed to a much greater extent, since the free-energy change be-comes much more negative. In reactions that release energy (for example, oxidation of asugar), the energy is \"captured\" and stored by the formation of a phosphate bond in a cou-pled reaction where ADP is converted into ATP. In addition to using ATP to store energy, the cell stores and releases hydrogen atoms from biological oxidation-reduction reactions by using nucleotide derivatives. The twomost common carriers of reducing power In addition to this important role in cellular energetics, the nucleotides are important monomers. The polynucleotides (DNA and RNA) are formed by the condensation of nu-cleotides. The nucleotides are linked together between the 3 \u00a2and 5 \u00a2carbons' successive sugar rings by phosphodiester bonds. The structures of DNA and RNA are illustrated inFig. 2.16. DNA is a very large threadlike macromolecule (MW, 2 \u00a510 9D in E. coli ) and has a double-helical three-dimensional structure. The sequence of bases (purines and pyrim-idines) in DNA carries genetic information, whereas sugar and phosphate groups performa structural role. The base sequence of DNA is written in the 5 \u00a2\u00c6 3\u00a2direction, such as pAGCT. The double-helical structure of DNA is depicted in Fig. 2.17. In this structure,two helical polynucleotide chains are coiled around a common axis to form a double-helical DNA, and the chains run in opposite directions, 5 \u00a2\u00c63\u00a2and 3 \u00a2\u00c65\u00a2. The main fea- tures of double-helical DNA structure are as follows: 1.The phosphate and deoxyribose units are on the outer surface, but the bases point toward the chain center. The planes of the bases are perpendicular to the helix axis. 2.The diameter of the helix is 2 nm. The helical structure repeats after ten residues on each chain, at an interval of 3.4 nm. 3.The two chains are held together by hydrogen bonding between pairs of bases. Ade- nine is always paired with thymine (two H bonds); guanine is always paired with cytosine (three H bonds). This feature is essential to the genetic role of DNA. 4.The sequence of bases along a polynucleotide is not restricted in any way, although each strand must be complementary to the other. The precise sequence of bases car-ries the genetic information. The large number of H bonds formed between base pairs provides molecular stabi- lization. Regeneration of DNA from original DNA segments is known as DNA replication . When DNA segments are replicated, one strand of the new DNA segment comes directly from the parent DNA, and the other strand is newly synthesized using theparent DNA segment as a template. Therefore, DNA replication is semiconservative, asdepicted in Fig. 2.18. The replication of DNA is discussed in more detail in Chapter 4. Some cells contain circular DNA segments in cytoplasm that are called plasmids. Plasmids are nonchromosomal, autonomous, self-replicating DNA segments. Plasmids areeasily moved in and out of the cells and are often used for genetic engineering. Naturally oc-curring plasmids can encode factors that protect cells from antibiotics or harmful chemicals. Sec. 2.2 Cell Construction 43Linear rather than circular plasmids can be found in some yeasts and other organisms.ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 43Figure 2.16. Structure of DNA and RNA chains.

Semiconservative replication of DNA.ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 45The major function of DNA is to carry genetic information in its base sequence. The genetic information in DNA is transcribed by RNA molecules and translated in proteinsynthesis. The templates for RNA synthesis are DNA molecules, and RNA molecules arethe templates for protein synthesis. The formation of RNA molecules from DNA is knownas DNA transcription , and the formation of peptides and proteins from RNA is called translation . Certain RNA molecules function as the genetic information-carrying intermediates in protein synthesis ( messenger, m-RNA), whereas other RNA molecules [ transfer (t-RNA) and ribosomal (r-RNA)] are part of the machinery of protein synthesis. The ribosomal r-RNA is located in ribosomes which are small particles made of protein and RNA. Ribo- somes are cytoplasmic organelles (usually attached on the inner surfaces of endoplasmic reticulum in eucaryotes) and are the sites of protein synthesis. RNA is a long, unbranched macromolecule consisting of nucleotides joined by 3 \u00a2-5 \u00a2 phosphodiester bonds. An RNA molecule may contain from 70 to several thousand nu-cleotides. RNA molecules are usually single stranded, except some viral RNA. However,certain RNA molecules contain regions of double-helical structure, like hairpin loops.Figure 2.19 describes the cloverleaf structure of t-RNA (transfer RNA). In double-helicalregions of t-RNA, A pairs with U and G pairs with C. The RNA content of cells is usuallytwo to six times higher than the DNA content. Let us summarize the roles of each class of RNA species:Messenger RNA (m-RNA) is synthesized on the chromosome and carries genetic in- formation from the chromosome for synthesis of a particular protein to the ribosomes.The m-RNA molecule is a large one with a short half-life. Transfer RNA (t-RNA) is a relatively small and stable molecule that carries a spe- cific amino acid from the cytoplasm to the site of protein synthesis on ribosomes. t-RNAscontain 70 to 90 nucleotides and have a MW range of 23 to 28 kD. Each one of 20 aminoacids has at least one corresponding t-RNA. Ribosomal RNA (r-RNA) is the major component of ribosomes, constituting nearly 65 %. The remainder is various ribosomal proteins. Three distinct types of r-RNAs present in the E. coli ribosome are specified as 23S, 16S, and 5S, respectively, on the basis of their sedimentation coefficients (determined in a centrifuge). The symbol S denotes a Svedbergunit. The molecular weights are 35 kD for 5S, 550 kD for 16S, and 1,100 kD for 23S.These three r-RNAs differ in their base sequences and ratios. Eucaryotic cells have largerribosomes and four different of r-RNAs: 5S, 7S, 18S, and 28S. Ribosomal RNAsmake up a large fraction of total RNA. In E. coli , about 85 %of the total RNA is r-RNA, while t-RNA is about 12 %and m-RNA is 2 %to 3 %. 2.3. CELL NUTRIENTS 2.3.1. IntroductionA cell's composition differs greatly from its environment. A cell must selectively remove desirable compounds from its extracellular environment and retain other compoundswithin itself. A semipermeable membrane is the key to this selectivity. Since the cell dif- 46 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 46fers so greatly in composition from its environment, it must expend energy to maintain itself away from thermodynamic equilibrium. Thermodynamic equilibrium and death areequivalent for a cell. All organisms except viruses contain large amounts of water (about 80 %). About 50 %of dry weight of cells is protein, and the proteins are largely enzymes (proteins that act as catalysts). The nucleic acid content (which contains the genetic code and machinery Sec. 2.3 Cell Nutrients 47 Figure 2.19.

The amino acid corresponding to this codon (UUC) is phenylalanine whichis bound to the opposite end of the tRNA molecule. Many tRNA molecules contain un-usual bases, such as methyl cytosine (mC) and pseudouridine ( y). (With permission, from T. D. Brock, K. M. Brock, and D. M.

However, viruses may contain nucleic acids up to 50 %of their dry weight. Typically, the lipid content of most cells varies between 5 %to 15 %of dry weight. However, some cells accumulate PHB up to 90 %of the total mass under certain culture conditions. In general, the intracellular composition of cells varies depending on the type and age of the cells and the compositionof the nutrient media. Typical compositions for major groups of organisms are summa-rized in Table 2.7. Most of the products formed by organisms are produced as a result of their response to environmental conditions, such as nutrients, growth hormones, and ions. The qualita-tive and quantitative nutritional requirements of cells need to be determined to optimizegrowth and product formation. Nutrients required by cells can be classified in twocategories: 1.Macronutrients are needed in concentrations larger than 10 -4M. Carbon, nitro- gen, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, Mg2+, and K+are major macro- nutrients. 2.Micronutrients are needed in concentrations of less than 10-4M. Trace elements such as Mo2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, vitamins, growth hormones, and metabolic precursors are micronutrients. 48 An Overview of Biological Basics Chap. 2TABLE 2.7 Chemical Analyses, Dry Weights, and the Populations of Different Microorganisms Obtained in Culture Typical Typical population dry weight of Nucleic in culture this culture Organism Protein acid Lipid (numbers/ml) (g/100 ml) Comments Viruses 50-90 Some unicellular (50) (3) (10) monly found valuealgae but the composition varies with the growth conditions. aFor a virus of 200 nm diameter.

Macronutrients Carbon compounds are major sources of cellular carbon and energy. Microorganisms are classified in two categories on the basis of their carbon source: (1) Heterotrophs use or- ganic compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and hydrocarbons as a carbon and energysource. (2) Autotrophs use carbon dioxide as a carbon source. Mixotrophs concomitantly grow under both autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions; however, autotrophic growth isstimulated by compounds. Facultative autotrophs normally grow under au-totrophic conditions; however, they can grow under heterotrophic conditions in the ab-sence of CO 2and inorganic energy sources. Chemoautotrophs utilize CO2as a carbon source and obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. Photoautotrophs use CO2as a carbon source and utilize light as an energy source. The most common carbon sources in industrial fermentations are molasses (sucrose), starch (glucose, dextrin), corn syrup, and waste sulfite liquor (glucose). In laboratory fer-mentations, glucose, sucrose, and fructose are the most common carbon sources. Methanol,ethanol, and methane also constitute cheap carbon sources for some fermentations. In aero-bic fermentations, about 50 %of substrate carbon is incorporated into cells and about 50 % of it is used as an energy source. In anaerobic fermentations, a large fraction of substrate car-bon is converted to products and a smaller fraction is converted to cell mass (less than 30 %). Nitrogen constitutes about 10 %to 14 %of cell dry weight. The most widely used ni- trogen sources are ammonia or the ammonium salts [NH 4Cl, (NH4)2SO4, NH4NO3], pro- teins, peptides, and amino acids. Nitrogen is incorporated into cell mass in the form ofproteins and nucleic acids. Some organisms such as Azotobacter sp. and the cyanobacteria fix nitrogen from the atmosphere to form ammonium. Urea may also be used as a nitrogensource by some organisms. Organic nitrogen sources such as yeast extract and peptone areexpensive compared to ammonium salts. Some carbon and nitrogen sources utilized bythe fermentation industry are summarized in Table 2.8. Oxygen is present in all organic cell components and cellular water and constitutes about 20 %of the dry weight of cells. Molecular oxygen is required as a terminal electron acceptor in the aerobic metabolism of carbon compounds. Gaseous oxygen is introducedinto growth media by sparging air or by surface aeration.

Some bacteria such as methanogens can utilizehydrogen as an energy source. Phosphorus constitutes about 3 %of cell dry weight and is present in nucleic acids and in the cell wall of some gram-positive bacteria such as teichoic acids. Inorganic phos-phate salts, such common phosphate salts. Glyc- erophosphates can also be used as organic phosphate sources. Phosphorus is a keyelement in the regulation of cell metabolism. The phosphate level in the media should beless than 1 mM for the formation of many secondary metabolites such as antibiotics. Sulfur constitutes nearly 1 %of cell dry weight and is present in proteins and some coenzymes. Sulfate salts such as (NH 4)2SO4are the most common sulfur source. Sulfur- containing amino acids can also be used as a sulfur source. Certain autotrophs utilize S2+ and S0as energy sources. Potassium is a cofactor for some enzymes and is required in carbohydrate metabo- lism. Cells tend to actively take up K+and Mg2+and exclude Na+and Ca2+. The most K2HPO4, KH2PO4, and K3PO4. Magnesium is a cofactor for some enzymes and is present in cell walls and mem- branes. Ribosomes specifically require Mg2+ions. Magnesium is usually MgSO4/H115547H2O supplied as MgSO4/H115547H2O or MgCl2. Table 2.9 lists the eight major macronutrients and their physiological role. 2.3.3. MicronutrientsTrace elements are essential to microbial nutrition. Lack of essential trace elements in- creases the lag phase (the time from inoculation to active cell replication in batch culture)and may decrease the specific growth rate and the yield.

Iron (Fe) is present in ferredoxin and cytochrome and is an important cofactor. Iron also plays a regulatory rolein some fermentation processes (e.g., iron deficiency is required for the excretion of ri-boflavin by Ashbya gosypii and iron concentration regulates penicillin production by Penicillium chrysogenum) . Zinc (Zn) is a cofactor for some enzymes and also regulates some fermentations such as penicillin fermentation. Manganese (Mn) is also an enzymecofactor and plays a role in the regulation of secondary metabolism and excretion of pri-mary metabolites. 2.Trace elements needed under specific growth conditions are Cu, Co, Mo, Ca, Na, Cl, Ni, and Se. Copper (Cu) is present in certain respiratory-chain components and en-zymes. Copper deficiency stimulates penicillin and citric acid production. Cobalt (Co) ispresent in corrinoid compounds such as vitamin B 12. Propionic bacteria and certain methanogens require cobalt. Molybdenum (Mo) is a cofactor of nitrate reductase and ni-trogenase and is required for growth on NO 3and N2as the sole source of nitrogen. Cal- cium (Ca) is a cofactor for amylases and some proteases and is also present in somebacterial spores and in the cell walls of some cells, such as plant cells. Sodium (Na) is needed in trace amounts by some bacteria, especially by methanogens for ion balance. Sodium is important in the transport of charged species ineucaryotic cells. Chloride (Cl -) is needed by some halobacteria and marine microbes, which require Na+, too. Nickel (Ni) is required by some methanogens as a cofactor and Selenium (Se) is required in formate metabolism of some organisms. 3.Trace elements that are rarely required are B, Al, Si, Cr, V , Sn, Be, F, Ti, Ga, Ge, Br, Zr, W, Li, and I. These elements are required in concentrations of less than 10-6Mand are toxic at high concentrations, such as 10-4M. Some ions such as Mg2+, Fe3+, and PO3- 4may precipitate in nutrient medium and be- come unavailable to the cells. Chelating agents are used to form soluble compounds with the precipitating ions. Chelating agents have certain groups termed ligands that bind to metal ions to form soluble complexes. Major ligands are the most commonly usedchelating Na 2EDTA is the most common chelating agent. EDTA may remove some metal ion components of the cell wall, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+and may cause cell wall disintegration. Citric acid is metabolizable by some bacteria. Chelating agentsare included in media in low concentrations (e.g., 1 m M). Growth factors stimulate the growth and synthesis of some metabolites. Vitamins, hormones, and amino acids are major growth factors. Vitamins usually function as coen-zymes. Some commonly required vitamins are thiamine and vita- min K. Vitamins are required at a concentration range of 10-6Mto 10-12M. Depending on the organism, some or all of the amino acids may need to be supplied externally in con-centrations from 10 -6Mto 10-13M. Some fatty acids, such as oleic acid and sterols, are also needed in small quantities by some organisms. Higher forms of life, such as animaland plant cells, require hormones to regulate their metabolism. Insulin is a common hor-mone for animal cells, and auxin and cytokinins are plant-growth hormones.

Defined media contain specific amounts of pure chemical compounds with known chemical compositions. Amedium containing glucose, (NH 4) 2SO4, KH2PO4, and MgCl2is a defined medium. Com- plex media contain natural compounds whose chemical composition is not exactly known. A medium containing yeast extracts, peptone, molasses, or corn steep liquor is a complexmedium. A complex medium usually can provide the necessary growth factors, vitamins,hormones, and trace elements, often resulting in higher cell yields, compared to the de-fined medium. Often, complex media are less expensive than defined media. The primaryadvantage of defined media is that the results are more reproducible and the operator hasbetter control of the fermentation. Further, recovery and purification of a product is ofteneasier and cheaper in defined media.

SUMMARY Microbes can grow over an immense range of conditions: temperatures above boiling and below freezing; high salt concentrations; high pressures ( >1000 atm); and at low and high pH values (about 1 to 10). Cells that must use oxygen are known as aerobic . Cells that find oxygen toxic are anaerobic . Cells that can adapt to growth either with or without oxygen are facultative . The two major groups of cells are procaryotic and eucaryotic . Eucaryotic cells are more complex. The essential demarcation between procaryotic and eucaryotic is the ab-sence (procaryotes) or presence (eucaryotes) of a membrane around the chromosomal orgenetic material. The procaryotes can be divided into two major groups: the eubacteria and archae- bacteria . The archaebacteria are a group of ancient organisms; subdivisions include methanogens (methane producing), halobacteria (live in high-salt environments), andthermoacidophiles (grow best under conditions of high temperature and high acidity).Most eubacteria can be separated into gram-positive and gram-negative cells. Gram- positive cells have an inner membrane and strong cell wall. Gram-negative cells have an inner membrane and an outer membrane. The outer membrane is supported by cell wallmaterial but is less rigid than in gram-positive cells. The cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are photosynthetic procaryotes classified as a subdivision of the eubacteria. The eucaryotes contain both single-celled organisms and multicell systems. The fungi and yeasts, the algae, and the protozoa are all examples of single-celled eucaryotes.Plants and animals are multicellular eucaryotes. Viruses are replicating particles that are obligate parasites. Some viruses use DNA to store genetic information, while others use RNA. Viruses specific for bacteria are calledbacteriophages or phages. All cells contain the macromolecules: protein , RNA, and DNA . Other essential com- ponents of these cells are constructed from lipids and carbohydrates. Proteins are poly-mers of amino acids; typically, 20 different amino acids are used. Each amino acid has adistinctive side group. The sequence of amino acids determines the primary structure of the protein. Interactions among the side groups of the amino acids (hydrogen bonding,disulfide bonds, regions of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity) determine the secondary and tertiary structure of the molecule. If separate polypeptide chains associate to form the final structure, then we speak of quaternary structure . The three-dimensional shape of a protein is critical to its function. DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides. DNA contains the cell's genetic infor- mation. RNA is involved in transcribing and translating that information into real pro-teins. Messenger RNA transcribes the code; transfer RNA is an adapter molecule thattransports a specific amino acid to the reaction site for protein synthesis; and ribosomalRNAs are essential components of ribosomes, which are the structures responsible forprotein synthesis. In addition to their role as monomers for DNA and RNA synthesis, nucleotides play important roles in cellular energetics. The high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP can store energy. The hydrolysis of ATP when coupled to otherwise energetically unfavorable reac-tions can drive the reaction toward completion. NAD and NAPH are important carriers of reducing power . Sec. 2.4 Summary 53ch02.cou 10/11/01 10:46 PM Page 53Carbohydrates consist of sugars, and the polymerized products of sugars are called polysaccharides . Sugars represent convenient molecules for the rapid oxidation and re- lease of energy. The polysaccharides play an important structural role (as in cellulose) orcan be used as a cellular reserve of carbon and energy (as in starch). Lipids and related compounds are critical in the construction of cellular membranes. Some fats also form reserve sources. A number of growth factors or hormones involvelipid materials. Phospholipids are the primary components of biological membranes. The maintenance of cellular integrity requires the selective uptake of nutrients. One class of nutrients is the macronutrients , and these are used in large amounts. The micro- nutrients and trace nutrients are used in low concentrations; some of these compounds be- come toxic if present at too high a level. In a defined medium , all components added to the medium are identifiable chemical species. In a complex medium , one or more components are not chemically defined (e.g., yeast extract).

INTRODUCTION Enzymes are usually proteins of high molecular weight (15,000 <MW <several million daltons) that act as catalysts. Recently, it has been shown that some RNA molecules arealso catalytic, but the vast majority of cellular reactions are mediated by protein catalysts.RNA molecules that have catalytic properties are called ribozymes . Enzymes are specific, versatile, and very effective biological catalysts, resulting in much higher reaction rates ascompared to chemically catalyzed reactions under ambient conditions. More than 2000enzymes are known. Enzymes are named by adding the suffix - aseto the end of the sub- strate, such as urease, or the reaction catalyzed, such as alcohol dehydrogenase. Some en-zymes have a simple structure, such as a folded polypeptide chain (typical of mosthydrolytic enzymes). Many enzymes have more than one subunit. Some protein enzymesrequire a nonprotein group for their activity. This group is either a cofactor, such as metalions, Mg, Zn, Mn, Fe, or a coenzyme, such as a complex organic molecule, NAD, FAD,CoA, or some vitamins. An enzyme containing a nonprotein group is called a holoenzyme . The protein part of this enzyme is the apoenzyme (holoenzyme =apoenzyme + cofactor). Enzymes that occur in several different molecular forms, but catalyze the samereaction, are called isozymes . Some enzymes are grouped together to form enzyme com- plexes. Enzymes are substrate specific and are classified according to the reaction theycatalyze. Major classes of enzymes and their functions are listed in Table 3.1.3 57ch03 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 5758 Enzymes Chap. 33.2. HOW ENZYMES WORK Enzymes lower the activation energy of the reaction catalyzed by binding the substrate and forming an enzyme-substrate complex. Enzymes do not affect the free-energy changeor the equilibrium constant. Figure 3.1 illustrates the action of an enzyme from theactivation-energy point of view. For example, the activation energy for the decompositionof hydrogen peroxide varies depending on the type of catalysis. The activation energy ofthe uncatalyzed reaction at 20 C is 18 kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol), whereas the DE values for chemically catalyzed (by colloidal platinum) and enzymatically catalyzed(catalase) decomposition are 13 and 7 kcal/mol, respectively. That is, catalase acceleratesthe rate of reaction by a factor of about 10 8. The reader should note that this large change in rate for a relatively small change in activation energy is due to the exponential depen-dence of rate on activation energy. In this case, the ratio of the rates is exp( -7000/2 293) exp( -18,000/2 293).TABLE 3.1 International Classification of Enzymes: Class Names, Code Numbers, and Types of Reactions Catalyzed 1.

This interaction varies from one enzyme-substrate complex to another. Various studiesusing x-ray and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the presence of the enzyme-substrate(ES) complex. The interaction between the enzyme and its substrate is usually by weakforces. In most cases, van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding are responsible for theformation of ES complexes. The substrate binds to a specific site on the enzyme known asthe active site . The substrate is a relatively small molecule and fits into a certain region on the enzyme molecule, which is a much larger molecule. The simplest model describingthis interaction is the lock-and-key model, in which the enzyme represents the lock andthe substrate represents the key, as described in Fig. 3.2. In multisubstrate enzyme-catalyzed reactions, enzymes can hold substrates such that reactive regions of substrates are close to each other and to the enzyme's active site,which is known as the proximity effect . Also, enzymes may hold the substrates at certain positions and angles to improve the reaction rate, which is known as the orientation effect . In some enzymes, the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex causes slight changes inthe three-dimensional shape of the enzyme. This induced fit of the substrate to the enzymemolecule may contribute to the catalytic activity of the enzyme, too. The enzymeslysozyme and carboxypeptidase A have been observed to change their three-dimensionalstructure upon complexing with the substrate. Enzyme catalysis is affected not only by theprimary structure of enzymes but also by the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary struc-tures. The properties of the active site of enzymes and the folding characteristics have aprofound effect on the catalytic activity of enzymes. Certain enzymes require coenzymesand cofactors for proper functioning. Table 3.2 lists some enzymes and their cofactors andcoenzymes. Figure 3.1. Activation energies of of the kinetics of single-substrate-enzyme-catalyzed reactions was first developed by V . C. R. Henri in 1902 and by L. Michaelis and M. L. Menten in 1913.Kinetics of simple enzyme-catalyzed reactions are often referred to as Michaelis-Mentenkinetics or saturation kinetics. The qualitative features of enzyme kinetics are similar to Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics (see Fig. 3.3). These models are based on data frombatch reactors with constant liquid volume in which the initial substrate, [S 0], and en- zyme, [E0], concentrations are known. More complicated enzyme-substrate interactions such as multisubstrate-multienzyme reactions can take place in biological systems. Anenzyme solution has a fixed number of active sites to which substrates can bind. At highsubstrate concentrations, all these sites may be occupied by substrates or the enzyme issaturated . Saturation kinetics can be obtained from a simple reaction scheme that involves a reversible step for enzyme-substrate complex formation and a dissociation step of theES complex.

Lehninger, Biochemistry , 2d ed., Worth Publishers, New York, 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 60Sec. 3.3 Enzyme Kinetics 61It is assumed that the ES complex is established rather rapidly and the rate of the re- verse reaction of the second step is negligible. The assumption of an irreversible secondreaction often holds only when product accumulation is negligible at the beginning of thereaction. Two major approaches used in developing a rate expression for the enzyme-catalyzed reactions are (1) rapid-equilibrium approach and (2) quasi-steady-state approach. 3.3.2. Mechanistic Models for Simple Enzyme KineticsBoth the quasi-steady-state approximation and the assumption of rapid equilibrium share the same few initial steps in deriving a rate expression for the mechanism in eq. 3.1,where the rate of product formation is (3.2) where vis the rate of product formation or substrate consumption in moles/l-s. The rate constant k 2is often denoted as kcatin the biological literature. The rate of variation of the ES complex is (3.3) Since the enzyme is not consumed, the conservation equation on the enzyme yields (3.4) At this point, an assumption is required to achieve an analytical solution. 3.3.2.1.The rapid equilibrium assumption. Henri and Michaelis and Menten used essentially this approach.

The equilibrium constant is (3.5) Since [E] =[E0] -[ES] if enzyme is conserved, then (3.6) (3.7) where K\u00a2m= k-1/k1, which is the dissociation constant of the ES complex. Substituting eq. 3.7 into eq. 3.2 yields (3.8) where Vm=k2[E0]. In this case, the maximum forward velocity of the reaction is Vm. Vmchanges if more enzyme is added, but the addition of more substrate has no influence on Vm. K\u00a2mis often called the Michaelis-Menten constant, and the prime reminds us that it was derivedby assuming rapid equilibrium in the first step. A low value of K\u00a2 msuggests that the en- zyme has a high affinity for the substrate. Also, K\u00a2mcorresponds to the substrate concentra- tion, giving the half-maximal reaction velocity. An equation of exactly the same form as eq. 3.8 can be derived with a different, more general assumption applied to the reaction scheme in eq. 3.1. 3.3.2.2. The quasi-steady-state assumption. In many cases the assumption of rapid equilibrium following mass-action kinetics is not valid, although the enzyme-substrate reaction still shows saturation-type kinetics. G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane first proposed using the quasi-steady-state as- sumption. In most experimental systems a closed system (batch reactor) is used in whichthe initial substrate concentration greatly exceeds the initial enzyme concentration. Theysuggest that since [E 0] was small, d[ES]/ dt \u00aa0. (This logic is flawed. Do you see why?) Computer simulations of the actual time course represented by eqs. 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 haveshown that in a closed system the quasi-steady-state hypothesis holds after a brief tran- sient if [S 0] /H11271[E0] (for example, 100 \u00a5). Figure 3.4 displays one such time course. By applying the quasi-steady-state assumption to eq. 3.3, we find (3.9) Substituting the enzyme conservation eq. 3.4 in eq. 3.9 yields most circumstances ments), it is impossible to determine whether Kmor K\u00a2mis more suitable.

Experimentally Determining Rate Parameters for Michaelis-Menten T ype Kinetics The determination of values for Kmand Vmwith high precision can be difficult. Typically, experimental data are obtained from initial-rate experiments . A batch reactor is charged with a known amount of substrate [S0] and enzyme [E0]. The product (or substrate concentration) is plotted against time. The initial slope of this curve is estimated (i.e., v=d[P]/dt| t=0 =-d[S]/dt|t=0). This value of vthen depends on the values of [E0] and [S0] in the charge to the reactor. Many such experiments can be used to generate many pairs of v and [S] data. These could be plotted as in Fig. 3.3, but the accurate determination of K m from such a plot is very difficult. Consequently, other methods of analyzing such data have been suggested. 3.3.3.1. Double-reciprocal plot (Lineweaver-Burk plot). Equation 3.12b can be form: (3.13) A plot of 1/ vversus 1/[S] yields a linear line with a slope of Km/Vmand y-axis intercept of 1/Vm, as depicted in Fig. 3.5. A double-reciprocal plot gives good estimates on Vm, but not necessarily on Km. Because the error about the reciprocal of a data point is not symmetric, the reader should be cautious in applying regression analysis (least squares) to such plots.Data points at low substrate concentrations influence the slope and intercept more thanthose at high substrate concentrations.11 Equation 3.12b rearranged as (3.14) A plot of vversus v/[S] results in a line of slope -Kmand y-axis intercept of Vm, as de- picted in Fig. 3.6. Eadie-Hofstee plots can be subject to large errors since both coordi-nates contain u, but there is less bias on points at low [S]. 3.3.3.3. Hanes-Woolf plot. Rearrangement of plot of [S]/ vversus [S] in a line of slope 1/ V mand y-axis intercept of Km/Vm, as depicted in Fig. 3.7. This plot is used to determine Vmmore accurately. 3.3.3.4. Batch kinetics. The time course of variation of [S] in a batch enzy- matic reaction can be determined from (3.12 b) by integration to yield (3.16) Vt Kmm =- +[] [ ] a rameter, Vmis not. Kmis solely a function of rate parameters and is expected to change with temperature or pH. However, Vmis a function of the rate parameter k2and the initial enzyme level, [E0]. As [E0] changes, so does Vm. Of course, k2can be readily calculated if [E0] is known. For highly purified enzyme preparations it may be possible to express [E0] in terms of mol/l or g/l. When the enzyme is part of a crude preparation, its concentration is in terms of \"units.\" A \"unit\" is the amount of enzyme that gives a predetermined amount of catalyticactivity under specific conditions. For example, one unit would be formation of one mmol product per minute at a specified pH and temperature with a substrate concentration muchgreater than the value of K m. The specific activity is the number of units of activity per amount of total protein. For example, a crude cell lysate might have a specific activity of0.2 units/mg protein which upon purification may increase to 10 units/mg protein. Onlyenzyme that remains catalytically active will be measured. The enzyme may be denatured if it unfolds or has its three-dimensional shape altered by pH extremes or temperature dur-ing purification. The denatured enzyme will have no activity.VtK 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 66Example 3.1. To measure the amount of glucoamylase in a crude enzyme preparation, 1 ml of the crude en- zyme preparation containing 8 mg protein is added to 9 ml of a 4.44% starch solution. Oneunit of activity of glucoamylase is defined as the amount of enzyme which produces 1 mmol of glucose per min in a 4% solution of Lintner starch at pH 4.5 and at 60 C. Initial rate exper- iments show that the reaction produces 0.6 mmol of glucose/ml-min. What is the specific ac- tivity of the crude enzyme preparation? Solution The total amount of glucose made is 10 ml \u00a50.6 mmol glucose/ml-min or 6 mmol glucose per min. The specific activity is then: Vmmust have units such as mmol product/ml-min. Since Vm=k2E0, the dimensions of k2must reflect the definition of units in E0. In the above example we had a concentra- tion of enzyme of 8 mg protein/10 ml solution 0.75 units/mg protein or 0.6 units/ml. If, for example, Enzyme Kinetics 3.3.4.1. Allosteric enzymes. Some enzymes have more than one substrate binding site. The binding of one substrate to the enzyme facilitates binding of other sub-strate molecules. This behavior is known as allostery orcooperative binding, and regula- tory enzymes show this behavior. The rate expression in this case is (3.18) where n=cooperativity coefficient and n>1 indicates positive with enzyme kinetics, a sig-moidal -[S] plot for allosteric enzymes. The cooperativity coefficient can be determined by rearranging eq. 3.18 as (3.19) and by plotting ln v/(V m-v) versus ln[S] as depicted in Fig. 3.9. 3.3.4.2. Inhibited enzyme kinetics. Certain compounds may bind to en- zymes and reduce their activity. These compounds are known to be enzyme inhibitors. En-zyme inhibitions may be irreversible or reversible. Irreversible inhibitors such as heavymetals (lead, cadium, mercury, and others) form a stable complex with enzyme and re-duce enzyme activity. Such enzyme inhibition may be reversed only by using chelatingagents such as EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and citrate. Reversible inhibitorsmay dissociate more easily from the enzyme after binding. The three major classes of re-ln units 1 ml protein solution 8 mg/ml 6 units/8 mg protein 0.75 competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibi- tions. The substrate may act as an inhibitor in some cases. Competitive inhibitors are usually substrate analogs and compete with substrate for the active site of the enzyme. The competitive enzyme inhibition scheme can be described as (3.20)ES ES E P I EI+ + + 1 kk k K-\u00e6\u00c6\u00e6 11 2 Figure 3.8. Comparison of Michaelis- Menten and 69Assuming rapid equilibrium and with the definition of (3.21) we can develop the following equation for the rate of enzymatic conversion: (3.22) or (3.23) where . The net effect of competitive inhibition is an increased value of K\u00a2m,appand, there- fore, reduced reaction rate. Competitive inhibition can be overcome by high concentra-tions of substrate. Figure 3.10 describes competitive enzyme inhibition in the form of adouble-reciprocal plot. Noncompetitive inhibitors are not substrate analogs. Inhibitors bind on sites other than the active site and reduce enzyme affinity to the substrate. Noncompetitive enzymeinhibition can be described as follows: (3.24) With the definition of (3.25) we can develop the following rate [ ] [],[] [ ] [][] [ ] [] [] [ ] ++ +ES ES E P I I EI S =[] [ ] [],[] [ ] [] [] [ ] [] [ ] []ES ESEI EI E E ES EI and 6970 Enzymes Chap. 3or (3.27) where The net effect of noncompetitive inhibition is a reduction in Vm. High substrate con- centrations would not overcome noncompetitive inhibition. Other reagents need to beadded to block binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme. In some forms of noncompetitiveinhibition V mis reduced and K\u00a2mis increased. This occurs if the complex ESI can form product. Uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the ES complex only and have no affinity for the enzyme itself. The scheme 11:08 PM Page With the definition of (3.29) we can develop the following equation for the rate of reaction: (3.30) or (3.31) The net effect of uncompetitive inhibition is a reduction in both Vmand K\u00a2mvalues. Reduction in Vmhas a more pronounced effect than the reduction in K\u00a2m,and the net result is a reduction in reaction rate. Uncompetitive inhibition is described in Fig. 3.10 in theform of a double-reciprocal plot. High substrate concentrations may cause inhibition in some enzymatic reactions, known as substrate inhibition . Substrate inhibition is graphically described in Fig. 3.11.

Certain enzymes have ionic groups on their active sites, and these ionic groups must be in a suitable form (acid or base) to function. Variations inthe pH of the medium result in changes in the ionic form of the active site and changes inthe activity of the enzyme and hence the reaction rate. Changes in pH may also alter thethree-dimensional shape of the enzyme. For these reasons, enzymes are only active over acertain pH range. The pH of the medium may affect the maximum reaction rate, K m, and the stability of the enzyme. In some cases, the substrate may contain ionic groups, and thepH of the medium affects the affinity of the substrate to the enzyme. The following scheme may be used to describe pH dependence of the enzymatic re- action rate for ionizing enzymes. (3.40) With the definition ofEH EH S EHS EH P km2 \u00c6 \u00e6+ + Figure 3.13.

For the case of ionizing substrate, the following scheme and rate expression can be developed: Theoretical prediction of the pH optimum of enzymes requires a knowledge of the active site characteristics of enzymes, which are very difficult to obtain. The pH optimumfor an enzyme is usually determined experimentally. Figure 3.14 depicts variation of en-zymatic activity with pH for two different enzymes. 3.3.5.2. T emperature effects.

Figure 3.15 depicts the variation of reaction rate with temperature and the presence of an optimal temperature.The ascending part of Fig. 3.15 is known as temperature activation. The rate varies ac- cording to the Arrhenius equation in this region. (3.46a) (3.46b) kA eER Ta2=-vE=k2[] Figure 3.14. The pH-activity profiles of two enzymes.

A plot of ln uversus 1/ Tresults in a line of slope -Ea/R. The descending part of Fig. 3.15 is known as temperature inactivation or thermal denaturation . The kinetics of thermal denaturation can be expressed as (3.47) or (3.48) where [E0] is the initial enzyme concentration and kdis the denaturation constant. kdalso varies with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation. (3.49) where Edis the deactivation energy (kcal/mol). Consequently, (3.50) The activation energies of enzyme-catalyzed reactions are within the 4 to 20 kcal/g mol range (mostly about 11 kcal/g mol). Deactivation energies Edvary between 40 and 130 kcal/g (mostly about 70 kcal/g mol). That is, enzyme denaturation by tempera-ture is much faster than enzyme activation. A rise in temperature from 30 to 40 C results in a 1.8-fold increase in enzyme activity, but a 41-fold increase in enzyme denaturation.Variations in temperature may affect both V mand Kmvalues of enzymes. 3.3.6. Insoluble Substrates Enzymes are often used to attack large, insoluble substrates such as wood chips (in bio- pulping for paper manufacture) or cellulosic residues from agriculture (e.g., cornstalks).In these cases access to the reaction site on these biopolymers by enzymes is often limitedby enzyme diffusion. The number of potential reactive sites exceeds the number of en-zyme molecules. This situation is opposite that of the typical situation with soluble sub-strates, where access to the enzyme's active site limits reaction. If we consider initialreaction rates and if the reaction is first order with respect to the concentration of enzymebound to substrate (i.e., [ES]), then we can derive a rate expression: (3.51a) where PM Page 78Sec. 3.4 Immobilized Enzyme Systems 79The previous equation assumes slow binding of enzyme (i.e., [E] \u00aa[E0]), S0is the number of substrate bonds available initially for breakage, and kdesand kadsrefer to rates of en- zyme desorption and adsorption onto the insoluble matrix, respectively. 3.4 IMMOBILIZED ENZYME SYSTEMS The restriction of enzyme mobility in a fixed space is known as enzyme immobilization . Immobilization of enzymes provides important advantages, such as enzyme reutilizationand elimination of enzyme recovery and purification processes, and may provide a betterenvironment for enzyme activity. Since enzymes are expensive, catalyst reuse is criticalfor many processes. Since some of the intracellular enzymes are membrane bound, immo-bilized enzymes provide a model system to mimic and understand the action of somemembrane-bound intracellular enzymes. Product purity is usually improved, and effluenthandling problems are minimized by immobilization. 3.4.1. Methods of Immobilization Major methods of immobilization are summarized in Fig. 3.16. The two major categories are entrapment and surface immobilization. 3.4.1.1. Entrapment. Entrapment is the physical enclosure of enzymes in a small space. Matrix entrapment and membrane entrapment, including microencapsula-tion, are the two major methods of entrapment. Matrices used for enzyme immobilization are usually polymeric materials such as Ca-alginate, agar, k-carrageenin, polyacrylamide, and collagen. However, some solid ma- trices such as activated carbon, porous ceramic, and diatomaceous earth can also be usedfor this purpose. The matrix can be a particle, a membrane, or a fiber. When immobilizing Figure 3.16. Major immobilization methods.ch03 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 7980in a polymer matrix, enzyme solution is mixed with polymer solution before polymeriza- tion takes place. Polymerized gel-containing enzyme is either extruded or a template isused to shape the particles from a liquid polymer-enzyme mixture. Entrapment and sur-face attachment may be used in combination in some cases. Membrane entrapment of enzymes is possible; for example, hollow fiber units have been used to entrap an enzyme solution between thin, semipermeable membranes. Mem-branes of nylon, cellulose, polysulfone, and polyacrylate are commonly used. Configura-tions, other than hollow fibers, are possible, but in all cases a semipermeable membrane isused to retain high-molecular-weight compounds (enzyme), while allowing small-molecular-weight compounds (substrate or products) access to the enzyme. A special form of membrane entrapment is microencapsulation . In this technique, microscopic hollow spheres are formed. The spheres contain the enzyme solution, whilethe sphere is enclosed within a porous membrane. The membrane can be polymeric or anenriched interfacial phase formed around a microdrop. Despite the aforementioned advantages, enzyme entrapment may have its inherent problems, such as enzyme leakage into solution, significant diffusional limitations, reducedenzyme activity and stability, and lack of control of microenvironmental conditions. En-zyme leakage can be overcome by reducing the MW cutoff of membranes or the pore size ofsolid matrices. Diffusion limitations can be eliminated by reducing the particle size of ma-trices and/or capsules. Reduced enzyme activity and stability are due to unfavorable mi-croenvironmental conditions, which are difficult to control. However, by using differentmatrices and chemical ingredients, by changing processing conditions, and by reducing par-ticle or capsule size, more favorable microenvironmental conditions can be obtained. Diffu-sion barrier is usually less significant in microcapsules as compared to gel beads. 3.4.1.2. Surface immobilization. The two major types of immobilization of enzymes on the surfaces of support materials are adsorption and covalent binding. Adsorption is the attachment of enzymes on the surfaces of support particles by weak physical forces, such as van der Waals or dispersion forces. The active site of the adsorbedenzyme is usually unaffected, and nearly full activity is retained upon adsorption. However,desorption of enzymes is a common problem, especially in the presence of strong hydrody-namic forces, since binding forces are weak. Adsorption of enzymes may be stabilized bycross-linking with glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde treatment can denature some proteins.Support materials used for enzyme adsorption can be inorganic materials, such as alumina,silica, porous glass, ceramics, diatomaceous earth, clay, and bentonite, or organic materials,such as cellulose (CMC, DEAE-cellulose), starch, activated carbon, and ion-exchangeresins, such as Amberlite, Sephadex, and Dowex. The surfaces of the support materials mayneed to be pretreated (chemically or physically) for effective immobilization. Covalent binding is the retention of enzymes on support surfaces by covalent bond formation. Enzyme molecules bind to support material via certain functional groups, suchas amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and sulfhydryl groups. These functional groups must not bein the active site. One common trick is to block the active site by flooding the enzymesolution with a competitive inhibitor prior to covalent binding. Functional groups on sup-port material are usually activated by using chemical reagents, such as cyanogen bromide,carbodiimide, and glutaraldehyde. Support materials with various functional groups andthe chemical reagents used for the covalent binding of proteins are listed in Table 3.3. 80 Enzymes Chap. 3ch03 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 8081TABLE 3.3 Methods of Covalent Binding of Enzymes to Supports Supports with \u2014OH (a) Using cyanogen bromide (b) Using S-triazine derivatives Supports with \u2014NH2 diazotization (b) Using glutaraldehyde (continued )ch03 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 8182 TABLE 3.3 Methods of Covalent Binding of Enzymes to Supports ( Continued ) Supports with \u2014COOH (a) Via azide derivative 1) 2) (b) Using a carbodiimide Supports containing anhydrides With permission, from D. I. C. Wang et al., Fermentation and Enzyme Technology , John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1979. ch03 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 82Binding groups on the protein molecule are usually side groups (R) or the amino or car- boxyl groups of the polypeptide chain. The cross-linking of enzyme molecules with each other using agents such as glu- taraldehyde, bis-diazobenzidine, and 2,2-disulfonic acid is another method of enzyme im- mobilization. Cross-linking can be achieved in several different ways: enzymes can becross-linked with glutaraldehyde to form an insoluble aggregate, adsorbed enzymes maybe cross-linked, or cross-linking may take place following the impregnation of poroussupport material with enzyme solution. Cross-linking may cause significant changes inthe active site of enzymes, and also severe diffusion limitations may result. The most suitable support material and immobilization method vary depending on the enzyme and particular application. Two major criteria used in the selection of supportmaterial are (1) the binding capacity of the support material, which is a function of chargedensity, functional groups, porosity, and hydrophobicity of the support surface, and (2) stability and retention of enzymatic activity, which is a function of functional groupson support material and microenvironmental conditions. If immobilization causes someconformational changes on the enzyme, or if reactive groups on the active site of the en-zyme are involved in binding, a loss in enzyme activity can take place upon immobiliza-tion. Usually, immobilization results in a loss in enzyme activity and stability. However, insome cases, immobilization may cause an increase in enzyme activity and stability due tomore favorable microenvironmental conditions. Because enzymes often have more thanone functional site that can bind the surface, an immobilized enzyme preparation may bevery heterogeneous. Even when binding does not alter enzyme structure, some enzymecan be bound with the active site oriented away from the substrate solution and toward thesupport surface, decreasing the access of the substrate to the enzyme. Retention of activityvaries with the method used. Table 3.4 summarizes the retention of activity of aminoacy-lase immobilized by different methods.

Wang et al., Fermentation and Enzyme Technology , John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1979.ch03 11:08 Diffusional Limitations in Immobilized Enzyme Systems Diffusional resistances may be observed at different levels in immobilized enzymes. These resistances vary depending on the nature of the support material (porous, nonporous), hy-drodynamical conditions surrounding the support material, and distribution of the enzymeinside or on the surface of the support material. Whether diffusion resistance has a signifi-cant effect on the rate of enzymatic reaction rate depends on the relative rate of the reactionrate and diffusion rate, which is characterized by the Damk\u00f6hler number (Da). (3.52) where [S b] is substrate concentration in bulk liquid (g/cm3) and kLis the mass-transfer co- efficient (cm/s). The rate of enzymatic conversion may be limited by diffusion of the substrate or re- action, depending on the value of the Damk\u00f6hler number. If Da >>1, the diffusion rate is limiting. For Da <<1, the reaction rate is limiting, and for Da \u00aa1, the diffusion and reac- tion resistances are comparable. Diffusion and enzymatic reactions may be simultaneous,with enzymes entrapped in a solid matrix, or may be two consecutive phenomena for ad-sorbed enzymes. 3.4.2.1. Diffusion effects in surface-bound enzymes on nonporous sup- port materials. Assume a situation where enzymes are bound and evenly distributed on the surface of a nonporous support material, all enzyme molecules are equally active,and substrate diffuses through a thin liquid film surrounding the support surface to reachthe reactive surfaces, as depicted in Fig. 3.17. Assume further that the process of immobi-lization has not altered the protein structure, and the intrinsic kinetic parameters (V m, Km) are unaltered.Damaximum rate of reaction maximum rate of diffusion== V km Lb\u00a2 []S Figure 3.17. Substrate concentration pro- file in a liquid film around adsorbed en-zymes. 84 Enzymes Chap. 3 84 Enzymes PM Page 84Sec. 3.4 Immobilized Enzyme Systems 85At steady state, the reaction rate is equal to the mass-transfer rate: (3.53) where V\u00a2mis the maximum reaction rate per unit of external surface area and kLis the liquid mass-transfer coefficient. This equation is quadratic in [Ss], the substrate concentration at the surface. It can be solved analytically, but the solution is cumbersome. Furthermore,the value of [S s] is not amenable to direct experimental observation. Equation 3.53 can be solved graphically as depicted in Fig. 3.18. Such a plot also makes it easy to visualize the effects of parameter changes such as stirring rate, changes inbulk substrate concentration, Figure 3.18. Graphical solution for amount of reaction per unit surface area for enzyme immobilized on a nonporous catalyst. Curve A results from a knowledge of the intrinsicsolution-based kinetic parameters and the surface loading of enzyme (right side of eq. 3.53). Line B is the mass transfer equation (left side of eq. 3.53). The intersection ofthe two lines is the reaction rate, u, that can be sustained in the system. The responses for two different bulk substrate concentrations are shown.ch03 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 85When the system is strongly mass-transfer limited, [Ss] \u00aa0, since the reaction is rapid compared to mass transfer, and (3.54) and the system behaves as pseudo first order. When the system is reaction limited (Da <<1), the reaction rate is often expressed as (3.55a) where, with appropriate assumptions, (3.55b) Under these circumstances, the apparent Michaelis-Menten \"constant\" is a function of stirring speed. Usually, Km,appis estimated experimentally as the value of [Sb], giving one- half of the maximal reaction rate. Example 3.4 Consider a system where a flat sheet of polymer coated with enzyme is placed in a stirred beaker. The intrinsic maximum reaction rate ( Vm) of the enzyme is 6 \u00a510-6mol/s-mg en- zyme. The amount of enzyme bound to the surface has been determined to be 1 \u00a510-4mg enzyme/cm2of support. In solution, the value of Kmhas been determined to be 2 \u00a510-3 mol/l. The mass-transfer coefficient can be estimated from standard correlations for stirred vessels. We assume in this case a very poorly mixed system where kL=4.3 \u00a510-5cm/s. What is the reaction rate when (a) the bulk concentration of the substrate is 7 \u00a510-3mol/l? (b) Sb= 1 \u00a510-2mol/l? Solution The solution is given in Fig. 3.18. The key is to note that the mass-transfer rate equals the reaction rate at steady state, and as a consequence the right side of eq. 3.53 mustequal the left side. In case (a), this occurs at a substrate surface concentration of about 0.0015mol/l with a reaction rate of 2.3 \u00a510 -10mol/s-cm2. By increasing the bulk substrate concen- tration to 0.01 mol/l, the value of [Ss] increases to 0.0024 mol/l with a reaction rate about 3.3 \u00a510-10mol/s-cm2. 3.4.2.2. Diffusion effects in enzymes immobilized in a porous matrix. When enzymes are immobilized on internal pore surfaces of a porous matrix, substratediffuses through the tortuous pathway among pores and reacts with enzyme immobilizedon pore surfaces. Diffusion and reaction are simultaneous in this case, as depicted in Fig. 3.19. Assume that enzyme is uniformly distributed in a spherical support particle; the re- action kinetics are expressed by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and there is no partitioningof the substrate between the exterior and interior of the support. Then we write the follow-ing equation, stating that diffusion rate is equal to reaction rate at steady state:KKV kKm, >> 1, 86 Enzymes 3ch03 11:08 PM Page 86Sec. max- imum reaction rate per unit volume of support, and Deis the effective diffusivity of sub- strate within the porous matrix. Equation 3.56 can be written in dimensionless form by defining the following di- mensionless variables: (3.57a) or (3.57b) where ically solved to determine the substrate profile inside the matrix. The rate of substrateconsumption is equal to the rate of substrate transfer through the external surface of thesupport particle at steady state into the sphere.

The value ofthe effectiveness factor is a measure of the extent of diffusion limitation. For h<1, the conversion is diffusion limited, whereas for h\u00aa1 values, conversion is limited by the re- action rate and diffusion limitations are negligible. The factor is a function of fand bas depicted in Figure 3.20. For a zero-order reaction rate ( b \u00c6 0), h\u00aa1 for a large range of Thiele modulus values such as 1 <f< 100.

(3.60) When internal diffusion limits the enzymatic reaction rate, the rate-constant V m,app and Km,appvalues are not true intrinsic rate constants, but apparent values.

The particle size ( R) should be as small as possible within the constraints of particle integrity, resistance to compression, and the nature of the particle recovery systems. The maximumreaction rate is determined by enzyme activity and concentration in the support. Highenzyme content will result in high enzyme activity per unit of reaction volume but loweffectiveness factor. On the other hand, low enzyme content will result in lower en-zyme activity per unit volume but a high effectiveness factor. For maximum conversionrates, particle size should be small ( D p\u00a310 mm) and enzyme loading should be optimized. As depicted in the example in Fig. 3.21, Dp\u00a310 mm and enzyme loadings of less than 10 mg/cm3are required for high values of the effectiveness factor (h 0.8). Example 3.5 D. Thornton and co-workers studied the hydrolysis of sucrose at pH =4.5 and 25 C using crude invertase obtained from baker's yeast in free and immobilized form. The following ini-tial velocity data were obtained with 408 units of crude enzyme (1 unit =quantity of enzyme when incubated with 0.29 Msucrose in a buffer at pH 4.5 and 25 C). Figure 3.21.

Electrostatic and Steric Effects in Immobilized Enzyme Systems When enzymes are immobilized in a charged matrix as a result of a change in the mi- croenvironment of the enzyme, the apparent bulk pH optimum of the immobilized en-zyme will shift from that of soluble enzyme. The charged matrix will repel or attractsubstrates, product, cofactors, and H +depending on the type and quantity of surface charge. For an enzyme immobilized onto a charged support, the shift in the pH-activityprofile is given by (3.61) where pH iand pHeare internal and external pH values, respectively; zis the charge (valence) on and Ris the gas constant. Expressions similar to eq. 3.61 apply to other nonreactive charged medium components. The intrinsic activity of the enzyme is al-tered by the local changes in pH and ionic constituents. Further alterations in the apparentkinetics are due to the repulsion or attraction of substrates or inhibitors. The activity of an enzyme toward a high-molecular-weight substrate is usually re- duced upon immobilization to a much greater extent than for a low-molecular-weight sub-strate. This is mainly because of steric hindrance by the support. Certain substrates, suchas starch, have molecular weights comparable to those of enzymes and may therefore notbe able to penetrate to the active sites of immobilized enzymes. Immobilization also affects the thermal stability of enzymes. Thermal stability often increases upon immobilization due to the presence of thermal diffusion barriers and theconstraints on protein unfolding. However, decreases in thermal stability have been notedin a few cases. The pH stability of enzymes usually increases upon immobilization, too. 3.5. LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION OF ENZYMES Among various enzymes produced at large are produced using overproducing strains of certain organisms.Separation and purification of an enzyme from an organism require disruption of cells, re-moval of cell debris and nucleic acids, precipitation of proteins, ultrafiltration of the de-sired enzyme, chromatographic separations (optional), crystallization, and drying. Theprocess scheme varies depending on whether the enzyme is intracellular or extracellular.In some cases, it may be more advantageous to use inactive (dead or resting) cells with thedesired enzyme activity in immobilized form. This approach eliminates costly enzymeseparation and purification steps and is therefore economically more feasible. Details ofprotein separations are covered in Chapter 11. The first step in the large-scale production of enzymes is to cultivate the organisms pro- ducing the desired enzyme. Enzyme production can be regulated and fermentation conditionscan be optimized for overproduction of the enzyme. Proteases are produced by using over-producing produced by yeast and Aspergillus; lipases are produced by certain strains of yeasts and fungi; glucose isomerase is produced by Flavobacterium ar- borescens or Bacillus coagulans . After the cultivation step, cells are separated from the media usually by filtration or sometimes by centrifugation. Depending on the intracellular or extra-cellular nature of the enzyme, either the cells or the fermentation broth is further processed toseparate and purify the enzyme. The recovery of intracellular enzymes is more complicatedand involves the disruption of cells and removal of cell debris and nucleic acids. Figure 3.23depicts a schematic of an enzyme plant producing intracellular enzymes. In some cases, enzyme may be both intracellular and extracellular, which requires processing of both broth and cells. Intracellular enzymes may be released by increasingthe permeability of cell membrane. Certain salts such as CaCl 2and other chemicals such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and pH shift may be used for this purpose. If enzyme re-lease is not complete, then cell disruption may be essential. The processes used to produce these industrial enzymes have much in common with our later discussions on processes to make proteins from recombinant DNA. 3.6. MEDICAL AND INDUSTRIAL UTILIZATION OF ENZYMES Enzymes have been significant industrial products for more than a hundred years. How- ever, the range of potential application is increasing rapidly. With the advent of recombi-nant DNA technology it has become possible to make formerly rare enzymes in large Figure 3.23. A flowsheet for the production of an extracellular enzyme.ch03 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 92Sec. 3.6 Medical and Industrial Utilization of Enzymes 93quantities and, hence, reduce cost. Also, in pharmaceutical manufacture the desire to make chirally pure compounds is leading to new opportunities. Chirality is important in aproduct; in a racemic mixture one enantiomer is often therapeutically useful while theother may cause side effects and add no therapeutic value. The ability of enzymes to rec-ognize chiral isomers and react with only one of them can be a key component in pharma-ceutical synthesis. Processes that depend on a mixture of chemical and enzymaticsynthesis are being developed for a new generation of pharmaceuticals. Technological advances have facilitated the use of enzymes over an increasingly broad range of process conditions. Enzymes from organisms that grow in unusual environ-ments (e.g., deep ocean, salt lakes, and hot springs) are increasingly available for study andpotential use. New enzymes and better control of reaction conditions allow the use of en-zymes in the presence of high concentrations of organics, in high-salt aqueous environ-ments, or at extreme temperatures, pH, or pressures. As we couple new insights into therelationship of enzyme structure to biological function with recombinant DNA technology,we are able to produce enzymes that are human designed or manipulated (see Section 14.9on protein engineering). We no longer need to depend solely on natural sources for enzymes. While there are many reasons to be optimistic about increasing use of enzymes, the number of enzymes made at high volume for industrial purposes evolves more slowly. In1996 the U.S. sales of industrial enzymes were $372 million, and sales are projected togrow to $686 million by 2006. The products made in enzyme processes are worth billionsof dollars. Table 3.5 provides a breakdown of projected enzyme sales by industrial sector.Table 3.6 lists some industrially important enzymes. Proteases hydrolyze proteins into smaller peptide units and constitute a large and in- dustrially important group of enzymes. Proteases constitute about 60 %of the total enzyme market. Industrial proteases are obtained pergillus, Rhizopus, and Mucor ), animal pancreas, and plants. Most of the industrial pro- teases are endoproteases. Proteases are used in food processing, such as cheese making(rennet), baking, meat tenderization (papain, trypsin), and brewing protein stains (subtilisin Carlsberg); and in tanning andthe medical treatment of wounds.

The major components in pectinases are pectin esterase, polygalacturonase, and polymethylgalacturonatelyase. Pectinases areused in fruit juice processing and wine making to increase juice yield, reduce viscosity,and clear the juice. Lipases hydrolyze lipids into fatty acids and glycerol and are produced from animal pancreas, some molds, and yeasts. Lipases may be used to hydrolyze oils for soap manu-facture and to hydrolyze the lipid-fat compounds present in waste-water streams. Inter-esterification of oils and fats may be catalyzed by lipases. Lipases may also be used in thecheese and butter industry to impart flavor as a result of the hydrolysis of fats. Lipase-containing detergents are an important application of lipases. Amylases are used for the hydrolysis of starch and are produced by many differ- ent organisms, including A. niger and B. subtilis . Three major types of amylases are and solubilizes amylose. For b-amylase amylose and produces maltose residues. b-amylase is known as a saccharifying enzyme. a-1,6 glycosidic linkages in the amylopectin fraction of starch are hydrolyzed by glucoamylase, which is also known as a saccharifying enzyme. In theUnited States on the average, nearly 1.3 \u00a510 9lb/yr of glucose is produced by the enzy- matic starch. The enzyme ages in starch selectively.TABLE 3.6 Some Industrially Important Enzymes Name Example of Source Application Amylase Bacillus subtilis, Aspergillus niger Starch hydrolysis, glucose production Glucoamylase A. niger, Rhizopus niveus, Endomycopsis Saccharification of starch, glucose Meat tenderizer, beer haze removalPapain Papaya Digestive aid, meat tenderizer, medical applications Pepsin Animal stomach Digestive aid, meat tenderizerRennet Calf stomach/recombinant E. coli Cheese isomerase Flavobacterium Lactobacillus brevis Isomerization of glucose fructose Penicillinase B. subtilis Degradation of penicillin Glucose oxidase A. niger Glucose \u00c6gluconic acid, dried-egg manufacture Lignases Fungal of further fermentation Pectinase A. oryzae, A. niger, A. flavus Clarification of are used in the hydrolysis of cellulose and are produced by some Tricho- derma species, such as Trichoderma viride or T. reesei ; and by some molds, such as Aspergillus niger and Thermomonospora; and by some Clostridium species. Cellulase is an enzyme complex and its formation is induced by cellulose. Trichoderma cellulase hydrolyzes crystalline cellulose, but Aspergillus cellulase does first hy- drolyzed to cellobiose by cellulase, and cellobiose is further hydrolyzed to glucose by b-glucosidase. Both of these enzymes are inhibited by their end products, cellobiose and glucose. Cellulases are used in cereal processing, alcohol fermentation from biomass,brewing, and waste treatment. Hemicellulases hydrolyze hemicellulose to five-carbon sugar units and are pro- duced by some molds, such as white rot fungi and A. niger . Hemicellulases are used in combination with other enzymes in baking doughs, brewing mashes, alcohol fermentationfrom biomass, and waste treatment. Lactases are used to hydrolyze lactose in whey to glucose and galactose and are produced by yeast and some Aspergillus species. Lactases are used in the fermentation of cheese whey to ethanol. Other microbial b-1,4 glucanases produced , A. and Penicillium emersonii are used in brewing mashes containing barley or malt. These enzymes improve wort filtration and extract yield. Penicillin acylase is used by the antibiotic industry to convert penicillin G to 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), which is a precursor for semisynthetic penicillinderivatives. Among other important industrial applications of enzymes are the conversion of fu- marate to L-aspartate by aspartase. In industry, this conversion is realized in a packed col- umn of immobilized dead E. coli cells with active aspartase enzyme. Fumarate solution is passed through the column, and aspartate is obtained in the effluent stream. Aspartate isfurther coupled with L-phenylalanine to produce aspartame, which is a low-calorie sweet-ener known as \"Nutrasweet .\" The conversion of glucose to fructose by immobilized glucose isomerase is an im- portant industrial process. Fructose is nearly 1.7 times sweeter than glucose and is used asa sweetener in soft drinks. Glucose isomerase is an intracellular enzyme and is producedby Bacillus and some inactive whole cells with glu- cose isomerase activity are used in a packed column for fructose formation from glucose.Cobalt (Co 2+) activity. Differ- ent immobilization methods are used by different companies. One uses flocculated wholecells of F . arborescens treated with glutaraldehyde in the form of dry spherical particles. Entrapment of whole cells in gelatin treated with glutaraldehyde, the use of glutaralde-hyde-treated lysed cells in the form of dry particles, and immobilization of the enzymeon inorganic support particles such as silica and alumina are methods used by othercompanies. DL-Acylamino acids are converted to a mixture of L- and D-amino acids by immobilized aminoacylase. L-Amino acids are separated from D-acylaminoacid, which is recycled back to the column. L-Amino acids have important applications in food technology and medicine. Enzymes are commonly used in medicine for diagnosis, therapy, and treatment pur- poses. Trypsin can be used as an antiinflammatory agent; lysozyme, which hydrolyzes the Sec. 3.6 Medical and Industrial Utilization of Enzymes 95ch03 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 95cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, is used as an antibacterial agent; streptokinase is used as an antiinflammatory agent; urokinase is used in dissolving and preventing blood clots.Asparaginase, which catalyzes the conversion of L-asparagine to L-aspartate, is used as an anticancer agent. Cancer cells require L-asparagine and are inhibited by asparaginase. As- paraginase is produced by E. coli . Glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which can easily be detected. Glucose oxidase isused for the determination of glucose levels in blood and urine. Penicillinases hydrolyzepenicillin and are used to treat allergic reactions against penicillin. Tissue plasminogenactivator (TPA) and streptokinase are used in the dissolution of blood clots (particularlyfollowing a heart attack or stroke). The development of biosensors using enzymes as integral components is proceeding rapidly. Two examples of immobilized enzyme electrodes are those used in the determina-tion of glucose and urea by using glucose oxidase and urease immobilized on the elec-trode membrane, respectively. Scarce enzymes (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) arefinding increasing uses, as the techniques of genetic engineering now make it possible toproduce usable quantities of such enzymes. The preceding list of enzymes and uses is not exhaustive, but merely illustrative. 3.7 . SUMMARY Enzymes are protein, glycoprotein, or RNA molecules that catalyze biologically impor- tant reactions. Enzymes are very effective, specific, and versatile biocatalysts. Enzymesbind substrate molecules and reduce the activation energy of the reaction catalyzed, re-sulting in significant increases in reaction rate. Some protein enzymes require a nonpro-tein group for their activity as a cofactor. Simple single-enzyme-catalyzed reaction kinetics can be described by Michaelis- Menten kinetics, which has a hyperbolic form in terms of substrate concentration. The ac-tivity of some enzymes can be altered by inhibitory compounds, which bind the enzymemolecule and reduce its activity. Enzyme inhibition may be competitive, noncompetitive,and uncompetitive. High substrate and product concentrations may be inhibitory, too. Enzymes require optimal conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength) for their max- imum activity. Enzymes with an ionizing group on their active site show a distinct optimalpH that corresponds to the natural active form of the enzyme. The activation energy ofenzyme-catalyzed reactions is within 4 to 20 kcal/g mol. Above the optimal temperature,enzymes lose their activity, and the inactivation energy is on the order of 40 to 130 kcal/g mol. Enzymes can be used in suspension or in immobilized form. Enzymes can be im- mobilized by entrapment in a porous matrix, by encapsulation in a semipermeable mem-brane capsule or between membranes, such as in a hollow-fiber unit, or by adsorptiononto a solid support surface. Enzyme immobilization provides enzyme reutilization, elim-inates costly enzyme recovery and purification processes, and may result in increased ac-tivity by providing a more suitable microenvironment for the enzyme. Enzymeimmobilization may result in diffusion limitations within the matrix. Immobilization mayalso cause enzyme instability, loss of activity, and a shift in optimal conditions (pH, ionicstrength). To obtain maximum reaction rates, the particle size of the support material and 96 Enzymes Chap. 3ch03 10/11/01 11:08 PM Page 96enzyme loading need to be optimized, and a support material with the correct surface characteristics must be selected. Enzymes are widely used in industry and have significant medical applications. Among the most widely used enzymes are proteases and utilization are amultibillion-dollar business with a great potential for expansion. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING ADAMS , M. W. W., AND R. M.

INTRODUCTION So far you have learned something about how cells are constructed and how enzymes func- tion. But a cell is much more than a bag filled with lipids, amino acids, sugars, enzymes, andnucleic acids. The cell must control how these components are made and interact with eachother. In this chapter we will explore some examples of metabolic regulation. It is this abil-ity to coordinate a wide variety of chemical reactions that makes a cell a cell. The key to metabolic regulation is the flow and control of information. The advent of computers has led many to speak of the \"Information Age.\" There are many analogiesbetween human society's need to use and exchange information and a cell's need to useand exchange information between subcellular components. Human society depends pri-marily on electronic signals for information storage, processing, and transmission; cellsuse chemical signals for the same purposes. Molecular biology is primarily the study ofinformation flow and control. 4.2. THE CENTRAL DOGMA Fortunately, almost all living systems have the same core approach to the storage, ex- pression, and utilization of information. Information is stored in the DNA molecule4 How Cells Work 1054ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 105106 How Cells Work Chap. 4and, like information on a computer tape or disc, can be replicated. It can also be played back or transcribed to produce a message. The message must translate into someaction, such as a series of calculations with the ultimate display of the results, for themessage to be useful. Cells operate with an analogous system. Figure 4.1 displays the central dogma of biology. Information is stored on the DNA molecule. That information can be repli- cated directly to form a second identical molecule. Further segments of information on the molecule can be transcribed to yield RNAs. Using a variety of RNAs, this infor- mation is translated into proteins. The proteins then perform a structural or enzymatic role, mediating almost all the metabolic functions in the cell. The information contentof the DNA molecule is static; changes occur slowly through infrequent mutations orrearrangements. Which species of RNA that are present and in what amount varies withtime and with changes in culture conditions. Likewise, the proteins that are present willchange with time but on a different time scale than for RNA species. Some of the pro-teins produced in the cell bind to DNA and regulate the transcriptional process to formRNAs. The important feature of the central dogma is its universality from the simplest to most complex organisms. One important, although relatively minor, deviation is that someRNA tumor viruses ( retroviruses ) contain an enzyme called reverse transcriptase . (The virus that causes AIDS, the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV , is a retrovirus, and Figure 4.1. The primary tenet of molecu- lar biology is the central dogma, which ap-plies to all organisms. DNA serves as thetemplate for its own replication, as well astranscription to RNA. The information tran-scribed into the RNA can then be translatedinto proteins using an RNA template. Notethat information on the DNA molecule isrelatively time independent, while the infor-mation which exists in the form of RNA andprotein molecules depends on the historyand environment of the cell and is time de-pendent. Some of the proteins interact withDNA to control which genes are transcribed.ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 106one approach to treatment is to selectively inhibit reverse transcriptase.) In this case, the virus encodes information on a RNA molecule. In the host cell, viral reverse transcriptaseproduces a viral DNA molecule using the viral RNA as a template. Such viruses are clini-cally important and the enzyme, reverse transcriptase, is an important tool in genetic engi-neering. Nonetheless, the process depicted in Fig. 4.1 is essentially applicable to any cellof commercial importance. For information storage and exchange to take place, there must be a language. We can conceive of all life as using a four-letter alphabet made up of the nucleotides dis-cussed in Chapter 2 (that is, A, T, G, and C in DNA). All words are three letters long; suchwords are called codons . With four letters and only three-letter words, we have a maxi- mum of 64 words. These words, when expressed, represent a particular amino acid or\"stop\" protein synthesis. When these words are put into a sequence, they can make a \"sentence\" (i.e., a gene ), which when properly transcribed and translated is a protein. Other combinations of wordsregulate when the gene is expressed. Carrying the analogy to the extreme, we may look atthe complete set of information in an organism's DNA (i.e., the genome ) as a book. (For the human genome it would be more than 1000 books the size of this one.) This simple language of 64 words is all that is necessary to summarize your total physical makeup at birth and all your natural capabilities. It is essentially universal, thesame for E. coli and Homo sapiens (humans). This universality has helped us to make great strides in understanding life and is a practical tool in genetic engineering and com-mercial biotechnology. Each of the steps in information storage and transfer (Fig. 4.1) requires a macromol- ecular template. Let us examine how these templates are made and how this genetic-levellanguage is preserved and expressed. 4.3. DNA REPLICATION: PRESERVING AND PROPAGATING THE CELLULAR MESSAGE The double-helix structure of DNA discussed in Chapter 2 is extremely well suited to its role of preserving genetic information. Information resides simply in the linear arrange-ment of the four nucleotide letters (A, T, G, and C). Because G can hydrogen-bind only to C and A only to T, the strands must be complementary if an undistorted double helix is to result. Replication is semiconservative (see Fig. 2.18); each daughter chromosome con- tains one parental strand and one newly generated strand. To illustrate the replication process (see Figs. 4.2 and 4.3), let us briefly consider DNA replication in E. coli . The enzyme responsible for covalently linking the monomers is DNA polymerase. Escherichia coli has three DNA polymerases (named Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III). A DNA polymerase is an enzyme that will link deoxynucleotides together toform a DNA polymer. Pol III enzymatically mediates the addition of nucleotides to anRNA primer. Pol I can hydrolyze an RNA primer and duplicates single-stranded regionsof DNA; it is also active in the repair of DNA molecules. The exact role of Pol II is stillunclear. In addition to the enzyme, the enzymatic reaction requires activated monomer and the template. The activated monomers are the nucleoside triphosphates. The formation of Sec. 4.3 DNA Replication 107ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 107108 How Cells Work Chap. 4 Figure 4.2. Initiation of DNA synthesis re- quires the formation of an RNA primer. the 5 \u00a2-3 \u00a2phosphodiester bond to link a nucleotide with the growing DNA molecule re- sults in the release of a pyrophosphate, which provides the energy for such a biosyntheticreaction. The resulting nucleoside monophosphates are the constituent monomers of theDNA molecule. Replication of the chromosome normally begins at a predetermined site, the origin of replication , which in E. coli is attached to the plasma membrane at the start of replica- tion. Initiator proteins bind to DNA at the origin of replication, break hydrogen bonds inthe local region of the origin, and force the two DNA strands apart. When DNA replica-tion begins, the two strands separate to form a Y-shaped structure called a replication fork . Movement of the fork must be facilitated by the energy-dependent action of DNA gyrase and unwinding enzymes . In E. coli the chromosome is circular. In E. coli (but not all or- ganisms) the synthesis of DNA is bidirectional . Two forks start at the origin and move in opposite directions until they meet again, approximately 180 from the origin. To initiate DNA synthesis, an RNA primer is required; RNA polymerase requires no primer to initiate the chain-building process, while DNA polymerase does. (We can spec-ulate on why this is so. In DNA replication, it is critical that no mistakes be made in theaddition of each nucleotide. The DNA polymerase, Pol III, can proofread , in part due to the enzyme's 3 \u00a2-to-5 \u00a2exonuclease activity, which can remove mismatches by moving backward. On the other hand, a mistake in RNA synthesis is not nearly so critical, soRNA polymerase lacks this proofreading capacity.) Once a short stretch of RNA comple-mentary to one of the DNA strands is made, DNA synthesis begins with Pol III. Next, theRNA portion is degraded by Pol I, and DNA is synthesized in its place. This process issummarized in Fig. 4.2.ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 108DNA polymerase works only in the 5 \u00a2-to-3 \u00a2direction, which means that the next nu- cleotide is always added to the exposed 3 \u00a2-OH group of the chain. Thus, one strand (the leading strand ) can be formed continuously if it is synthesized in the same direction as the replication fork is moving. The other strand (the lagging strand ) must be synthesized dis- continuously. Short pieces of DNA attached to RNA are formed on the lagging strand.These fragments are called Okazaki fragments . The whole process is summarized in Fig. 4.3. The enzyme, DNA ligase , which joins the two short pieces of DNA on the continuous strand, will be very important in our discussions of genetic engineering. Figure 4.3. Schematic representation of the steps of replication of the bacterial chromo- some. Part (a) represents a portion of a replicating bacterial chromosome at a stage shortlyafter replication has begun at the origin. The newly polymerized strands of DNA (wavylines) are synthesized in the 5 \u00a2-to-3 \u00a2direction (indicated by the arrows), using the preex- isting DNA strands (solid lines) as a template. The process creates two replication forks,which travel in opposite directions until they meet on the opposite side of the circularchromosome, completing the replication process. Part (b) represents a more detailed viewof one of the replicating forks and shows the process by which short lengths of DNA aresynthesized and eventually joined to produce a continuous new strand of DNA. For pur-poses of illustration, four short segments of nucleic acid are illustrated at various stages.In (1), primer RNA (thickened area) is being synthesized by an RNA polymerase (R Pol).Then, successively, in (2) DNA is being polymerized to it by DNA polymerase III (PolIII); in (3) a preceding primer RNA is being hydrolyzed, while DNA is being polymerizedin its place by the exonuclease and polymerase activities of DNA polymerase I (Pol I); fi-nally, the completed short segment of DNA (4) is joined to the continuous strand (5) bythe action of DNA ligase.

Sec. 4.3 DNA Replication 109ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 109This brief discussion summarizes the essentials of how one DNA molecule is made from another and thus preserves and propagates the genetic information in the originalmolecule. Now we turn our attention to how this genetic information can be transferred. 4.4. TRANSCRIPTION: SENDING THE MESSAGE The primary products of transcription are the three major types of RNA we introduced in Chapter 2: m-RNA, t-RNA, and r-RNA. Their rates of synthesis determine the cell's ca- pacity to make proteins. RNA synthesis from DNA is mediated by the enzyme, RNA poly- merase . To be functional, RNA polymerase must have two major subcomponents: the core enzyme and the sigma factor . The core enzyme contains the catalytic site, while the sigma factor is a protein essential to locating the appropriate beginning for the message. Thecore enzyme plus the sigma factor constitutes the holoenzyme . The student may wonder which of the two strands of DNA is actually transcribed. It turns out that either strand can be read. RNA polymerase always reads in the 3 \u00a2- to 5\u00a2-direction, so the direction of reading will be opposite on each strand. On one part of the chromosome, one strand of DNA may serve as the template or sense strand , and on an- other portion of the chromosome, the other strand may serve as a template. The processes of initiation, elongation, and termination are summarized in Fig. 4.4. The sigma factor is involved only in initiation. The sigma factor recognizes a specific se-quence of nucleotides on a DNA strand. This sequence is the promoter region . Promoters can vary somewhat, and this alters the affinity of the sigma factor (and consequently theholoenzyme) for a particular promoter. A strong promoter is one with a high affinity for the holoenzyme. The rate of formation of transcripts is determined primarily by the fre-quency of initiation of transcription, which is directly related to promoter strength. Thiswill be important in our discussions of genetic engineering. Cells usually have one domi-nant sigma factor that is required to recognize the vast majority of promoters in the cell.However, other sigma factors can play important roles under different growth conditions(particularly stress) and are used to initiate transcription from promoters that encode pro-teins important to the cell for coping with unusual growth conditions or stress. After the initiation site is recognized, elongation of the transcript begins. As soon as elongation is established, the sigma factor is released so it can be reused. The synthesis ofthe growing RNA molecule is energy requiring, so activated triphosphate monomers ofthe ribonucleotides are required. The transcript is made until the RNA polymerase encounters a stop signal, or tran- scription terminator . At this point, the RNA polymerase disassociates from the DNA tem- plate and the RNA transcript is released. In some cases an additional protein, the rho protein, is required for termination. Terminators can be strong or weak. If a weak termina-tor is coupled with a strong promoter, some of the RNA polymerase will read through the terminator, creating an artificially long transcript and possibly disrupting subsequent con-trol regions on that DNA strand. We must consider terminator regions and their strengthwhen constructing recombinant DNA systems. The transcripts that are formed may be roughly lumped as either stable or unstable RNA species. The stable RNA species are r-RNA and t-RNA. Messenger-RNA is highly unstable (about a 1-min half-life for a typical E. coli m -RNA, although m-RNA may be 110 How Cells Work Chap. 4ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 110considerably more stable in cells from higher plants and animals). The student should consider for a moment why m-RNA is relatively unstable. The answer should become ap- parent as we discuss translation and regulation. Although the general features of transcription are universal, there are some signifi- cant differences in transcription between procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. One example is Figure 4.4. Steps in messenger RNA synthesis. The start and stop sites are specific nu- cleotide sequences on the DNA. RNA polymerase moves down the DNA chain, causingtemporary opening of the double helix and transcription of one of the DNA strands. Rhobinds to the termination site and stops chain growth; termination can also occur at some siteswithout rho. (With permission, from T. D. Brock, D. W. Smith, and M. T. Madigan, Biology of Microorganisms , 4th ed., Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1984, p. 285.) Sec. 4.4 Transcription: Sending the Message 111ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 111that in procaryotes related proteins are often encoded in a row without interspacing termi- nators. Thus, transcription from a single promoter may result in a polygenic message. Polygenic indicates many genes; each single gene encodes a separate protein . Thus, the regulation of transcription from a single promoter can provide efficient regulation of func-tionally related proteins; such a strategy is particularly important for relatively small andsimple cells. On the other hand, eucaryotic cells do not produce polygenic messages. In procaryotic cells, there is no physical separation of the chromosome from the cy- toplasma and ribosomes. Often an m-RNA will bind to a ribosome and begin translation immediately, even while part of it is still being transcribed! However, in eucaryotes,where the nuclear membrane separates chromosomes and ribosomes, the m-RNA is often subject to processing before translation (see Fig. 4.5). The DNA can encode for a tran-script with an intervening sequence (called an intron ) in the middle of the transcript. This intron is then cut out of the transcript at two specific sites. The ends of the remaining frag-ments are joined by a process called m-RNA splicing . The spliced message can then be translated into an actual protein. The part of the transcript forming the intron is degradedand the monomers recycled. When m-RNA is recovered from the cytosol it will be in the mature form, while m-RNA within the nucleus has introns. Many eucaryotic genes con- tain \"nonsense DNA,\" which encodes the intronic part of the transcript. The word\"nonsense\" denotes that that particular sequence of DNA does not encode for amino Figure 4.5. In eucaryotes, RNA splicing is important. The presence of introns is a com- plication in cloning genes from eucaryotes procaryotes. 112 4ch04 10/11/01 PM Page 112Sec. 4.5 Translation: Message to Product 113acids. The role of introns is not well understood, but they likely play a role in either evolu- tion or cellular regulation or both. The presence of introns complicates the transfer of eu-caryotic genes to protein production systems in procaryotes such as E. coli . Two other m-RNA processing steps occur in eucaryotic cells that do not occur in procaryotes. One is RNA capping, in which the 5 \u00a2end is modified by the addition of a guanine nucleotide with a methyl group attached. The other is polyadenylation, in which a string of adenine nucleotides are added to the 3 \u00a2end. This tail of adenines is often several hundred nucleotides long. These two modifications are thought to increase m-RNA stabil- ity and facilitiate transport across the nuclear membrane. Once we understand transcription, we can tackle translation. The translation of in- formation on m-RNA into proteins occupies a very large fraction of the cells' resources. Like a large automobile plant, the generation of blueprints and the construction of themanufacturing machinery is worthless until product is made. 4.5. TRANSLATION: MESSAGE TO PRODUCT 4.5.1. Genetic Code: Universal MessageThe blueprint for any living cell is the genetic code. The code is made up of three-letter words ( codons ) with an alphabet of four letters. Sixty-four words are possible, but many of these words are redundant. Although such a \"language\" may appear to be ridiculouslysimple, it is sufficient to serve as a complete blueprint for the \"construction\" of the reader. The dictionary for this language is given in Table 4.1, and an illustration of the rela- tionship of nucleotides in the chromosome and m-RNA to the final protein product is given in Fig. 4.6. The code is degenerate in that more than one codon can specify a partic- ular amino acid (for example, UCC, specify serine). UAG, and UGA, are called nonsense codons in that they do not encode normally for amino acids. These codons act as stop points in translation and are encodedat the end of each gene. The genetic code is essentially universal, although some exceptions exist (particu- larly in the mitochondria and for inclusion of rare amino acids). This essential universalitygreatly facilitates genetic engineering. The language used to make a human protein is un-derstood in E. coli and yeast, and these simple cells will faithfully produce the same amino acid sequence as a human cell. Knowing the genetic language, we may ask more about the mechanism by which proteins are actually made. 4.5.2. T ranslation: How the Machinery Works The process of translation consists of three primary steps: initiation , elongation , and termination . For initiation ,m-RNA must bind to the ribosome. All protein synthesis begins with a AUG codon (or GUG) on the m-RNA. This AUG encodes for a modified methion- ine, N-formylmethionine. In the middle of a protein, AUG encodes for methionine, so the question is how the cell knows that a particular AUG is an initiation codon for ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 113Figure 4.6. Overview of the transfer of information from codons on the DNA template to proteins.

The answer lies about ten nucleotides upstream of the AUG, where the ribosome binding site (Shine-Delgarno box) is located. Ribosome binding sites canvary in strength and are an important consideration in genetic engineering. The initiationof polymerization in procaryotes requires an initiation complex composed of a 30s riboso- mal unit with an N-formylmethionine bound to its initiation region, a 50s ribosomal unit, three proteins called initiation factors (IF1, IF2, and IF3), and the phosphate bond energyfrom GTP. The elongation of the amino acid chain uses t-RNAs as decoders. One end of the t-RNA contains the anticodon , which is complementary to the codon on the m-RNA. The other end of the t-RNA binds a specific amino acid. The t-RNA is called charged when it is carrying an amino acid. The binding of an amino acid to the t-RNA molecule requires the energy from two phosphate bonds and enzymes known as aminoacyl-t-RNA syn- thetases . Figure 2.19 depicts a t-RNA molecule. The actual formation of the peptide bond between the two amino acids occurs on adjacent sites on the ribosome: the P or peptidyl site and the A or aminoacyl site (see Fig. 4.7). The growing protein occupies the P site, while the next amino acid to be addedoccupies the A site. As the peptide bond is formed, the t-RNA associated with the P site is released, and a rachet mechanism moves the m-RNA down one codon so as to cause the t-RNA that was in the A site to be in the P site. Then a charged t-RNA with the correct an- ticodon can be recognized and inserted into the A site. The whole process is then repeated.The cell expends a total of four phosphate bonds to add one amino acid to each growingpolypeptide (two to charge the t-RNA and two in the process of elongation), and this ac- counts for most of the cellular energy expenditure in bacteria. When a nonsense or stop codon is reached, the protein is released from the ribo- some with the aid of a protein release factor (RF). The 70S ribosome then dissociates into 30S and 50S subunits. An m-RNA typically is being read by many (for example, 10 to 20) ribosomes at once; as soon as one ribosome has moved sufficiently far along the messagethat the ribosome binding site is not physically blocked, another ribosome can bind andinitiate synthesis of a new polypeptide chain. 4.5.3. Posttranslational Processing: Making the Product Useful Often the polypeptide formed from the ribosome must undergo further processing before it can become truly useful. First, the newly formed chain must fold into the proper struc-ture; in some cases, several different chains must associate to form a particular enzyme orstructural protein. Additionally, chaperones are an important class of proteins that assist in the proper folding of peptides. There are distinct pathways to assist in folding polypep-tides. The level of chaperones in a cell increases in response to environmental stressessuch as high temperature. Misfolded proteins are subject to degradation if they remainsoluble. Often misfolded proteins aggregate and form insoluble particles (i.e., inclusionbodies). High levels of expression of foreign proteins through recombinant DNA technol-ogy in E. coli often overwhelm the processing machinery, resulting in inclusion bodies. The formation of proteins in inclusion bodies greatly complicates any bioprocess, since invitro methods to unfold and refold the protein product must be employed. Even when ach04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 115cell properly folds a protein, additional cellular processing steps must occur to make a useful product. Many proteins are secreted through a membrane. In many cases, the translocation of the protein across the membrane is done cotranslationally (during translation), while in some cases posttranslation movement across the membrane occurs. When proteins move across a membrane, they have a signal sequence (about 20 to 25 amino acids). This signal Figure 4.7. Translation of genetic information from a nucleotide sequence to an amino acid sequence. (With permission, from M. W. Jensen and D. N. Wright, Introduction to Medical Microbiology , Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1985, p. 66.) 116 How Cells Work Chap. 4ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 116Sec. 4.5 Translation: Message to Product 117sequence is clipped off during secretion. Such proteins exist in a pre-form and mature form. The pre-form is what is made from the m-RNA, but the actual active form is the ma- ture form. The pre-form is the signal sequence plus the mature form. In procaryotes secretion of proteins occurs through the cytoplasmic membrane. In E. coli and most gram-negative bacteria the outer membrane blocks release of the secreted protein into the extracellular compartment. In gram-positive cells secreted proteins readilypass the cell wall into the extracellular compartment. Whether a protein product is re-tained in a cell or released has a major impact on bioprocess design. In eucaryotic cells proteins are released by two pathways. Both involve exocytosis, where transport vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents. Transport vesicles mediate the transport of proteins and other chemicals from the endo-plasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus and from the Golgi apparatus to othermembrane-enclosed compartments. Such vesicles bud from a membrane and enclose anaqueous solution with specific proteins, lipids, or other compounds. In the secretory path-way vesicles, carrying proteins bud from the ER, enter the cisface of the Golgi apparatus, exit the Golgi trans face, and then fuse with the plasma membrane. Only proteins with a signal sequence are processed in the ER to enter the secretory pathway. Two pathways exist. One is the constitutive exocytosis pathway, which operates at all times and delivers lipids and proteins to the plasma membrane. The second is the regu- lated exocytosis pathway, which typically is in specialized secretory cells. These cells se- crete proteins or other chemicals only in response to specific chemical signals. Other modifications to proteins can take place, particularly in higher eucaryotic cells. These modifications involve the addition of nonamino acid components (for example, sug-ars and lipids) and phosphorylation . Glycosylation refers to the addition of sugars. These modifications can be quite complex and are important considerations in the choice of hostorganisms for the production of proteins. A bioprocess engineer must be aware that manyproteins are subject to extensive processing after the initial polypeptide chain is made. A particularly important aspect of posttranslational processing is N-linked glycosy- lation . The glycosylation pattern can serve to target the protein to a particular compart- ment or to control its degradation and removal from the organism. For therapeuticproteins injected into the human body these issues are critical ones. A protein productmay be ineffective if the N-linked glycosylation pattern is not humanlike, as the proteinmay not reach the target tissue or may be cleared (i.e., removed) from the body before itexerts the desired action. Further, undesirable immunogenic responses can occur if a pro-tein has a nonhumanlike pattern. Thus, the glycoform of a protein product is a key issue inbioprocesses to make therapeutic proteins (see Chapter 14). The process of N-linked glycosylation occurs only in eucaryotic cells and involves both the ER and Golgi. Thus, the use of procaryotic cells, such as E. coli , to serve as hosts for expression of human therapeutic proteins is limited to those proteins where N-linkedglycosylation is not present or unimportant. However, not all eucaryotic cells produceproteins with humanlike, N-linked glycosylation. For example, yeasts, lower fungi, andinsect cells often produce partially processed products. Even mammalian cells (includinghuman cells) will show altered patterns of glycosylation when cultured in bioreactors, andthese patterns can shift upon scale-up in bioreactor size. The process of N-linked glycosylation is depicted in Fig. 4.8. The pattern shown is \"typical,\" and many variants are possible. The natural proteins in the human body usuallych04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 117display a range of glycoforms; a single form is not observed. A simple sequence of three amino acids, of which asparagine must be one, is required for attachment of N-linked sug-ars and amino sugars. The sequence at the attachment site is Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where Xaais any amino acid and the third amino acid in the sequence must be serine or threonine.The process of N-linked glycosylation begins in the ER, where a preformed branched Figure 4.8.

The parentheses refer to an op- tional fucosylation. The GlcNAc-ase step is important in insect cells, but not mammaliancells. (Courtesy of C. Joosten.) 118 How Cells Work Chap. 10/11/01 pyrophosphate-oligosaccharide ) with 14 sugars is trans- ferred to the amino group of asparagine. The 14-sugar residue is first \"trimmed\" by a set of specific glycosidases. In yeast, oligosaccharide processing often stops in the ER, leading to simple glycoforms (or high mannose or oligomannose forms). The initial trimming takes place in the ER, followed bytransfer to the Golgi apparatus where final trimming occurs, followed by addition of vari-ous sugars or aminosugars. These units are added through the action of various glycosyl-transferases using nucleotide-sugar cosubstrates as sugar donors. In insect cells highlevels of N-acetylglucosaminidase activity results typically in dead-end structures with amannose cap. Complex glycoforms have sugar residues (N-acetyl glucosamine, galactose, and/or sialic acid) added to all branches of the oligosaccharide structure. Hybrid glyco- forms have at least one branch modified with one of these sugar residues and one or more with mannose as the terminal residue. 4.6. METABOLIC REGULATION Metabolic regulation is the heart of any living cell. Regulation takes place principally at the genetic level and at the cellular level (principally, control of enzyme activity andthrough cell surface receptors). Let us first consider genetic-level changes, as these fitmost closely with our discussion of transcription and translation. 4.6.1. Genetic-level Control:Which Proteins Are Synthesized? As the reader will recall, the formation of a protein requires transcription of a gene. Tran- scriptional control of protein synthesis is the most common control strategy used in bacte-ria. Control of protein synthesis in eucaryotes can be more complex, but the same basicconcepts hold. In the simplest terms, the cell senses that it has too much or too little of aparticular protein and responds by increasing or decreasing the rate of transcription of thatgene. One form of regulation is feedback repression ; in this case, the end product of enzy- matic activity accumulates and blocks transcription. Another form of regulation is induc- tion; a metabolite (often a substrate for a pathway) accumulates and acts as an inducer of transcription. These concepts are summarized in Figs. 4.9 and 4.10. In both cases a repres-sor protein is required. The repressor can bind to the operator region and hinder RNA polymerase binding. For repression, a corepressor (typically the end product of the path-way) is required, and the repressor can block transcription only when bound to the core-pressor. For induction, the inducer (typically a substrate for a reaction) will combine withthe repressor, and the complex is inactive as a repressor. Note in Figs. 4.9 and 4.10 that several genes are under the control of a single pro- moter. A set of contiguous genes, encoding proteins with related functions, under the con-trol of a single promoter-operator is called an operon . The operon concept is central to understanding microbial regulation. Control can be even more complex than indicated in Figs. 4.9 and 4.10. The lactose (or lac) operon controls the synthesis of three proteins involved in lactose utilization as acarbon and energy source in E. coli . These genes are lac z, lac y , and lac a . Lac z encodesch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 119b-galactosidase (or lactase), which cleaves lactose to glucose and galactose. The lac y pro- tein is a permease , which acts to increase the rate of uptake of lactose into the cell. Lac- tose is modified in the cell to allolactose, which acts as the inducer. The conversion oflactose to allolactose is through a secondary activity of the enzyme b-galactosidase. Re- pression of transcription in uninduced cells is incomplete, and a low level ( basal level ) of proteins from the operon is made. Allolactose acts as indicated in Fig. 4.10, but inductionby allolactose is not both necessary and sufficient for maximum transcription. Further reg-ulation is exerted through catabolite repression (also called the glucose effect ). When E. coli senses the presence of a carbon-energy source preferred to lactose, it will not use the lactose until the preferred substrate (e.g., glucose) is fully consumed. Thiscontrol mechanism is exercised through a protein called CAP (cyclic-AMP-activating pro- tein). Cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels increase as the amount of energy available to the celldecreases. Thus, if glucose or a preferred substrate is depleted, the level of cAMP will in-crease. Under these conditions, cAMP will readily bind to CAP to form a complex thatbinds near the lac promoter. This complex greatly enhances RNA polymerase binding tothe lac promoter. Enhancer regions exist in both procaryotes and eucaryotes. Figure 4.9. Process of enzyme repression. (a) Transcription of the operon occurs be-cause the repressor is unable to bind to theoperator. (b) After a corepressor (small mol-ecule) binds to the repressor, the repressornow binds to the operator and blocks tran-scription. m-RNA and the proteins it codes for are not made.

The repressor is made on a separategene called lac i. 120 How Cells Work Chap. 4ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 120The reader should now see how the cellular control strategy emerges. If the cell has an energetically favorable carbon-energy source available, it will not expend significantenergy to create a pathway for utilization of a less favorable carbon-energy source. If,however, energy levels are low, then it seeks an alternative carbon-energy source. If andonly if lactose is present will it activate the pathway necessary to utilize it. Catabolite repression is a global response that affects more than lactose utilization. Furthermore, even for lactose, the glucose effect can work at levels other than genetic.The presence of glucose inhibits the uptake of lactose, even when an active uptake systemexists. This is called inducer exclusion . The role of global regulatory systems is still emerging. One concept is that of a reg- ulon. Many noncontiguous gene products under the control of separate promoters can be coordinately expressed in a regulon. The best studied regulon is the heat shock regulon . The cell has a specific response to a sudden increase in temperature, which results in the elevated synthesis of specific proteins. Evidence now exists that this regulon works byemploying the induction of an alternative sigma factor, which leads to high levels of tran-scription from promoters that do not readily recognize the normal E. coli sigma factor. Examples of other regulons involve nitrogen and phosphate starvation, as well as a switchfrom aerobic to anaerobic conditions. Although many genes are regulated, others are not. Unregulated genes are termed constitutive , which means that their gene products are made at a relatively constant rate ir- respective of changes in growth conditions. Constitutive gene products are those that acell expects to utilize under almost any condition; the enzymes involved in glycolysis arean example. Example 4.1. Diauxic growth is a term to describe the sequential use of two different carbon-energy sources. Industrially, diauxic growth is observed when fermenting a mixture of sugars, suchas might result from the hydrolysis of biomass. The classic example of diauxic growth isgrowth of E. coli on a glucose-lactose mixture. Observations on this system led to formula- tion of the operon hypothesis and the basis for a Nobel prize (for J. Monod and F. Jacob).Consider the plot in Fig. 4.11, where the utilization of glucose and lactose and the growth ofa culture are depicted for a batch culture (batch reactor). As we will discuss in more detail inChapter 6, the amount of biomass in a culture, X, accumulates exponentially. Note that at 2 h after inoculation, cells are growing rapidly, glucose is being consumed, and lactose is notbeing utilized. At 7 h, cell mass accumulation is zero. All the glucose has been consumed. At10 h the culture is growing and lactose is being consumed, but the rate of growth (cell massaccumulation) is less than at 2 h. Explain what is happening with intracellular control to account for the observations at 2, 7, and 10 h. What rate of b-galactosidase formation would you expect to find in the culture at these times in comparison to the basal rate (which is <1%of the maximum rate)? Solution At 2 h the lac operon is fully induced, since lactose converted to allolactose com- bines with the lac i repressor protein, inactivating it. With the repressor protein deacti- vated, RNA polymerase is free to bind to the promoter, but does so inefficiently. Glucose Or other stresses that result in abnormal protein formation or membrane disruption. Sec. 4.6 Metabolic Regulation 121ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 121levels are still high, which results in higher levels of ATP and low levels of AMP and cAMP. Consequently, little cAMP-CAP complex is formed, and the interaction of the lacpromoter with RNA polymerase is weak in the absence of cAMP-CAP. The rate of -galactosidase formation would be slightly increased from the basal level\u2014perhaps 5 % of the maximal rate. At 7 h the glucose has been fully consumed. The cell cannot generate energy, and the level of ATP decreases and cAMP increases. The cAMP-CAP complex level is high, whichincreases the efficiency of binding RNA polymerase to the lac promoter. This increased bind-ing leads to increased transcription and translation. The rate of -galactosidase formation is maximal and much higher than the basal rate or the 2 h rate. However, the cells have not yetaccumulated sufficient intracellular concentrations of -galactosidase and lac permease to allow efficient use of lactose and rapid growth. At 10 h the intracellular content of proteins made from the lac operon is sufficiently high to allow maximal growth on lactose. However, this growth rate on lactose is slower thanon glucose, since lactose utilization generates energy less efficiently. Consequently, thecAMP level remains higher than when the cell was growing on glucose. The level of produc-tion of -galactosidase is thus higher than the basal or 2 h level. Irrespective of whether an enzyme is made from a regulated or constitutive gene, its activity in the cell is regulated. Let us now consider control at the enzymatic level. Figure 4.11. Diauxic growth curve for E. coli on glucose and lactose. 122 How Cells Work Chap. 4ch04.cou 10/17/01 3:06 PM Page 1224.6.2. Metabolic Pathway Control In Chapter 3, we learned how enzyme activity could be modulated by inhibitors or activa- tors. Here we discuss how the activities of a group of enzymes (a pathway) can be con-trolled. The cell will attempt to make the most efficient use of its resources; thefermentation specialist tries to disrupt the cell's control strategy so as to cause the cell tooverproduce the product of commercial interest. An understanding of how cells controltheir pathways is vital to the development of many bioprocesses. First, consider the very simple case of a linear pathway making a product, P 1. Most often the first reaction in the pathway is inhibited by accumulation of the product ( feed- back inhibition or end-product inhibition ). The enzyme for the entry of substrate into the pathway would be an allosteric enzyme (as described in Chapter 3), where the binding ofthe end product in a secondary site distorts the enzyme so as to render the primary activesite ineffective. Thus, if the cell has a sufficient supply of P 1(perhaps through an addition to the growth medium), it will deactivate the pathway so that the substrates normally usedto make P 1can be utilized elsewhere. This simple concept can be extended to more complicated pathways with many branch points (see Fig. 4.12). Assuming that P1and P2are both essential metabolites, the cell may use one of several strategies to ensure adequate levels of P1and P2with efficient utilization of substrates. One strategy is the use of isofunctional enzymes ( isozymes ). Two separate enzymes are made to carry out the same conversion, while each is sensitive to inhibition by a differ-ent end product. Thus, if P 1is added in excess in the growth medium, it inhibits one of the Figure 4.12. Examples of feedback control of branched pathways. P1and P2are the Mj-1to Mj. Possible paths of inhibition are shown by dashed lines. Sec. 4.6 Metabolic Regulation 123ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 123isozymes (E2), while the other enzyme (E \u00a22) is fully active. Sufficient activity remains through isozyme E \u00a22to ensure adequate synthesis of P2. An alternative approach is concerted feedback inhibition . Here a single enzyme with two allosteric binding sites (for P1and P2) controls entry into the pathway. A high level of either P1or P2is not sufficient by itself to inhibit enzyme E2, while a high level of both P1and P2will result in full inhibition. A third possibility is sequential feedback inhibition, by which an intermediate at the branch point can accumulate and act as the inhibitor of metabolic flux into the pathway.High levels of P P2inhibit E4and E5, respectively. If either E4or E5is blocked, M3will accumulate, but not as rapidly as when both E4or E5are blocked. Thus, intermediate flux levels are allowed if either P1or P2is high, but the pathway is inacti- vated if both P1and P2are high. Other effects are possible in more complex pathways. A single allosteric enzyme may have effector sites for several end products of a pathway; each effector causes onlypartial inhibition. Full inhibition is a cumulative effect, and such control is called cumula- tive feedback inhibition or cooperative feedback inhibition . In other cases, effectors from related pathways may also act as activators. Typically, this situation occurs when the prod-uct of one pathway was the substrate for another pathway. An example of control of acomplex pathway (for aspartate) is described in Section 4.9. The reader should pause to consider the differences between feedback inhibition and repression. Inhibition occurs at the enzyme level and is rapid; repression occurs at thegenetic level and is slower and more difficult to reverse. In bacteria where growth ratesare high, unwanted enzymes are diluted out by growth. Would such a strategy work forhigher cells in differentiated structures? Clearly not, since growth rates would be nearlyzero. In higher cells (animals and plants) the control of enzyme levels is done primarilythrough the control of protein degradation, rather than at the level of synthesis. Most ofour discussion has centered on procaryotes; the extension of these concepts to higher or-ganisms must be done carefully. Another caution is that the control strategy that one organism adopts for a particular pathway may differ greatly from that adopted by even a closely related organism with anidentical pathway. Even if an industrial organism is closely related to a well-studied or-ganism, it is prudent to check whether the same regulatory strategy has been adopted byboth organisms. Knowing the cellular regulatory strategy facilitates choosing optimal fer-menter operating strategy, as well as guiding strain improvement programs. We have touched on some aspects of cellular metabolic regulation. A related form of regulation that we are just now beginning to appreciate has to do with the cell surface. 4.7 . HOW THE CELL SENSES ITS EXTRACELLULAR ENVIRONMENT 4.7 .1. Mechanisms to T ransport Small Molecules across Cellular Membranes A cell must take nutrients from its extracellular environment if it is to grow or retain meta- bolic activity. As we discussed in Example 4.1, which nutrients enter the cell and at whatrate can be important in regulating metabolic activity. 124 How Cells Work Chap. 4ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 124Sec. 4.7 How the Cell Senses Its Extracellular Environment 125Molecules enter the cell through either energy-independent or energy-dependent mechanisms. The two primary examples of energy-independent uptake are passive diffu- sion and facilitated diffusion . Energy-dependent uptake mechanisms include active trans- port and group translocation . In passive diffusion, molecules move down a concentration gradient (from high to low concentration) that is thermodynamically favorable. Consequently, (4.1) where JAis the flux of species Aacross the membrane (mol/cm2- s), Kpis the permeabil- ity the of A(mol/cm3), and CAIis the in- tracellular concentration. The cytoplasmic membrane consists of a lipid core with perhapsvery small pores. For charged or large molecules, the value K pis very low and the flow of material across the membrane is negligible. The cellular uptake of water and oxygen ap-pears to be due to passive diffusion. Furthermore, lipids or other highly hydrophobic com-pounds have relatively high diffusivities (10 -8cm2/s) in cellular membranes, and passive diffusion can be a mechanism of quantitative importance in their transport. With facilitated transport, a carrier molecule (protein) can combine specifically and reversibly with the molecule of interest. The carrier protein is considered embedded in themembrane. By mechanisms that are not yet understood, the carrier protein, after bindingthe target molecule, undergoes conformational changes, which result in release of themolecule on the intracellular side of the membrane. The carrier can bind to the target mol-ecule on the intracellular side of the membrane, resulting in the efflux or exit of the mole-cule from the cell. Thus, the net flux of a molecule depends on its concentration gradient. The carrier protein effectively increases the solubility of the target molecule in the membrane. Because the binding of the molecule to the carrier protein is saturable (just asthe active sites in the enzyme solution can be saturated), the flux rate of the target mole-cule into the cell depends on concentration differently than indicated in eq. 4.1. A simpleequation to represent uptake by facilitated transport is (4.2) where K MTis related to the binding affinity of the substrate (mol/cm3) and JA MAX is the maximum flux rate of A(mol/cm2-s). When CAE >CAI, the net flux will be into the cell. If CAI>CAE, there will be a net efflux of Afrom the cell. The transport is down a concentra- tion gradient and is thermodynamically favorable. Facilitated transport of sugars and otherlow-molecular-weight organic compounds is common in eucaryotic cells, but infrequentin procaryotes. However, the uptake of glycerol in enteric bacteria (such as E. coli ) is a good example of facilitated transport. Active transport is similar to facilitated transport in that proteins embedded in the cellular membrane are necessary components. The primary difference is that active trans-port occurs against a concentration gradient . The intracellular concentration of a mole- cule may be a hundredfold or more greater than the extracellular concentration. Themovement of a molecule up a concentration gradient is thermodynamically unfavorableand will not occur spontaneously; energy must be supplied. In active transport, several en-ergy sources are possible: (1) the electrostatic or 5:08 PM Page example, of Na+or other ions) derived from the proton- motive force by other active transport systems and by the hydrolysis of ATP. The proton-motive force results from the extrusion of hydrogen as protons. The res- piratory system of cells (see Section 5.4) is configured to ensure the formation of suchgradients. Hydrogen atoms, removed from hydrogen carriers (most commonly NADH) onthe inside of the membrane, are carried to the outside of the membrane, while the elec-trons removed from these hydrogen atoms return to the cytoplasmic side of the mem-brane. These electrons are passed to a final electron acceptor, such as O 2. When O2is reduced, it combines with H+from the cytoplasm, causing the net formation of OH-on the inside. Because the flow of H+and OH-across the cellular membrane by passive dif- fusion is negligible, the concentration of chemical species cannot equilibrate. This processgenerates a pH gradient and an electrical potential across the cell. The inside of the cell isalkaline compared to the extracellular compartment. The cytoplasmic side of the mem-brane is electrically negative, and the outside is electrically positive. The proton-motiveforce is essential to the transport of many species across the membrane, and any defect inthe cellular membrane that allows free movement of H +and OH-across the cell boundary can collapse the proton-motive force and lead to cell death. Some molecules are actively transported into the cell without coupling to the ion gradients generated by the proton-motive force. By a mechanism that is not fully under-stood, the hydrolysis of ATP to release phosphate bond energy is utilized directly in trans-port (e.g., the transport of maltose in E. coli ). For these mechanisms of active transport, irrespective of energy source, we can write an equation analogous to Michaelis-Menten kinetics to describe uptake: (4.3) The use of eq. 4.3 is meaningful only when the cell is in an energy-sufficient state. Another energy-dependent approach to the uptake of nutrients is group transloca- tion. The key factor here is the chemical modification of the substrate during the processof transport. The best-studied system of this type is the phosphotransferase system . This system is important in the uptake of many sugars in bacteria. The biological system itselfis complex, consisting of four separate phosphate-carrying proteins. The source of energyis phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Effectively, the process can be represented by: (4.4) By converting the sugar to the phosphorylated form, the sugar is trapped inside the cell. The asymmetric nature of the cellular membrane and this process make the process essentiallyirreversible. Because the phosphorylation of sugars is a key step in their metabolism, nutri-ent uptake of these compounds by group translocation is energetically preferable to activetransport. In active transport, energy would be expended to move the unmodified substrateinto the cell, and then further energy would be expended to phosphorylate it. Certainly, the control of nutrient uptake is a critical cellular interface with its extra- cellular environment. In some cases, however, cells can sense their external environmentwithout the direct uptake of nutrients.sugar + 4ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 1264.7 .2. Role of Cell Receptors in Metabolism and Cellular Differentiation Almost all cells have receptors on their surfaces. These receptors can bind a chemical in the extracellular space. Such receptors are important in providing a cell with informationabout its environment. Receptors are particularly important in animals in facilitating cell-to-cell communication. Animal cell surface receptors are important in transducing signalsfor growth or cellular differentiation. These receptors are also prime targets for the devel-opment of therapeutic drugs. Many viruses mimic certain chemicals (e.g., a growth factor)and use cell surface receptors as a means to entering a cell. Simpler examples exist with bacteria. Some motile bacteria have been observed to move up concentration gradients for nutrients or down gradients of toxic compounds. Thisresponse is called chemotaxis . Some microbes also respond to gradients in aero- taxis ) or light ( phototaxis ). Such tactic phenomena are only partially understood. How- ever, the mechanism involves receptors binding to specific compounds, and this bindingreaction results in changes in the direction of movement of the flagella. Motile cells movein a random-walk fashion; the binding of an attractant extends the length of time the cellmoves on a \"run\" toward the attractant. Similarly, repellents decrease the length of runsup the concentration gradient. Chemotaxis is described in Fig. 4.13. Figure 4.13.

Sec. 4.7 How the Cell Senses Its Extracellular Environment 127ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 127Microbial communities can be highly structured (e.g., biofilms), and cell-to-cell communication is important in the physical structure of the biofilm. Cell-to-cell commu-nication is also important in microbial phenomena such as bioluminescence, exoenzymesynthesis, and virulence factor production. Basically, these phenomena depend on localcell concentration. How do bacteria count? They produce a chemical known as quorum sensing molecule , whose accumulation is related to cell concentration. When the quorum sensing molecule reaches a critical concentration, it activates a response in all of the cellspresent. A typical quorum sensing molecule is an acylated homoserine lactone. The mech-anism of quorum sensing depends on an intracellular receptor protein, while chemotaxisdepends on surface receptor proteins. With higher cells, the timing of events in cellular differentiation and development is associated with surface receptors. With higher organisms, these receptors are highlyevolved. Some receptors respond to steroids ( steroid hormone receptors ). Steroids do not act by themselves in cells, but rather the hormone-receptor complex interacts with spe-cific gene loci to activate the transcription of a target gene. A host of other animal receptors respond to a variety of small proteins that act as hormones or growth factors . These growth factors are normally required for the cell to ini- tiate DNA synthesis and replication. Such factors are a critical component in the large-scale use of animal tissue cultures. Other cell surface receptors are important in theattachment of cells to surfaces. Cell adhesion can lead to changes in cell morphology,which are often critical to animal cell growth and normal physiological function. Theexact mechanism by which receptors work is only now starting to emerge. One possibilityfor growth factors that stimulate cell division is that binding of the growth factor to the re-ceptor causes an alteration in the structure of the receptor. This altered structure possessescatalytic activity (e.g., tyrosine kinase activity), which begins a cascade of reactions lead-ing to cellular division. Surface receptors are continuously internalized, complexes de-graded, and receptors recycled to supplement newly formed receptors. Thus, the ability ofcells to respond to changes in environmental signals is continuously renewed. Such recep-tors will be important in our later discussions on animal cell culture. 4.8. SUMMARY In this chapter you have learned some of the elementary concepts of how cells control their composition in response to an ever-changing environment. The essence of an organism re-sides in the chromosome as a linear sequence of nucleotides that form a language ( genetic code) to describe the production of cellular components. The cell controls the storage and transmission of such information, using macromolecular templates. DNA is responsible forits own replication and is also a template for transcription of information into RNA species that serve both as machinery and template to translate genetic information into proteins. Pro- teins often must undergo posttranslational processing to perform their intended functions. The cell controls both the amount and activity of proteins it produces. Many pro- teins are made on regulated genes (e.g., repressible or inducible ), although other genes are constitutive . With regulated genes, small effector molecules alter the binding of regulatory proteins to specific sequences of nucleotides in the operator or promoter regions. Such regulatory proteins can block transcription or in other cases enhance it. A group of con- 128 How Cells Work Chap. 4ch04 10/11/01 5:08 PM Page 128tiguous genes under the control of a single promoter-operator is called an operon . More global control through regulons is also evident. Some gene products are not regulated, and their synthesis is constitutive. Once a protein is formed, its activity may be continuously modulated through feed- back inhibition . A number of alternative strategies are employed by the cell to control the flux of material through a pathway. Another form of regulation occurs through the interac-tion of extracellular compounds with cell surface protein receptors. 4.9. APPENDIX: EXAMPLES OF REGULATION OF COMPLEX PATHWAYS In E. coli the conversion of aspartic acid to aspartyl phosphate is mediated by three iso- functional enzymes, of which two (designated as aand cin Fig. 4A.1) also mediate the conversion of aspartic acid semialdehyde to homoserine. Enzyme a, possessing both these functions, is feedback inhibited, and its synthesis is repressed by threonine. Enzyme c, which similarly possesses both functions, is inhibited, and repressed by lysine. The third,aspartokinase (enzyme b), is not subject to end-product inhibition, but its synthesis is re- pressed by methionine (Table 4A.1). The enzymes of the L-lysine cat- alyze reactions leading in each case to a single end product and are subject to specific re-pression by that end product ( L-lysine and L-methionine, respectively). The third branch of the aspartate pathway is subject to much more complex regula- tion, for two reasons. First, L-threonine, formed through this branch, is both a component of proteins and an intermediate in the synthesis of another amino acid, L-isoleucine. Sec- ond, four of the five enzymes ( e-h) that catalyze L-isoleucine synthesis from L-threonine, also catalyze analogous steps in the completely separate biosynthetic pathway by which L-valine is synthesized from pyruvic acid. The intermediate of this latter pathway, a-ketoisovaleric acid, is also a precursor of the amino acid L-leucine. These interrelation- ships are shown in Fig. 4A.1(b). L-isoleucine is an end-product inhibitor of the enzyme d, catalyzing the first step in its synthesis from L-threonine; this enzyme has no other biosynthetic role. L-valine is an end- product inhibitor of an enzyme ( e) that has a dual metabolic role, since it catalyzes steps in both isoleucine and valine biosynthesis. In certain strains of E. coli , this enzyme is extremely sensitive to valine inhibition, with the result that exogenous valine prevents growth, an effectthat can be reversed by the simultaneous provision of exogenous isoleucine. The L-leucine branch of the valine pathway is regulated by L-leucine, which is an end-product inhibitor of the first enzyme, i, specific to this branch. These interrelationships are shown in Fig. 4A.1(b). As shown in Table 4A.2, many of the enzymes that catalyze steps in the synthesis of L-isoleucine, L-valine, and L-leucine are subject to repression only by a mixture of the three end products, a phenomenon known as multivalent repression . However, the five en- zymes specific to L-leucine synthesis are specifically repressed by this amino acid alone. With permission, from R. Y .

INTRODUCTION A major challenge in bioprocess development is to select an organism that can efficiently make a given product. Before about 1980 only naturally occurring organisms were avail-able. With the advent of genetic engineering, it is possible to remove and add genes to anorganism to alter its metabolic functions in a predetermined manner ( metabolic engineer- ing). In any case, the bioprocess developer must understand the metabolic capabilities of natural organisms either to use them directly or to know how to metabolically engineerthem to make a desired, perhaps novel, product. Consequently, we turn our focus towardslearning about some essential metabolic pathways. Differences in microbial metabolism can be attributed partly to genetic differences and/or to differences in their responses to changes in their environment. Even the samespecies may produce different products when grown under different nutritional and envi-ronmental conditions. The control of metabolic pathways by nutritional and environmen-tal regulation has become an important consideration in bioprocess engineering. Forexample, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) produces ethanol when grown under anaerobic conditions. However, the major product is yeast cells (baker's yeast) whengrowth conditions are aerobic. Moreover, even under aerobic conditions, at high glucoseconcentrations some ethanol formation is observed, which indicates metabolic regulationnot only by oxygen, but also by glucose. This effect is known as the Crabtree effect . formation during baker's yeast fermentation may be reduced or eliminated by cul- ture with intermittent addition of glucose or by using carbon sources other than sucrose orglucose that support less rapid growth. The major metabolic pathways and products of various microorganisms will be briefly covered in this chapter. Metabolic pathways are subgrouped as aerobic and anaero-bic metabolism. There are two key concepts in our discussion. Catabolism is the intracellular process of degrading a compound into smaller and simpler products (e.g., glucose to CO 2 and H2O). Catabolism produces energy for the cell. Anabolism is involved in the synthesis of more complex compounds (e.g., glucose to glycogen) and requires energy. 5.2. BIOENERGETICS Living cells require energy for biosynthesis, transport of nutrients, motility, and mainte- nance. This energy is obtained from the catabolism of carbon compounds, mainly carbo-hydrates. Carbohydrates are synthesized from CO 2and H2O in the presence of light by photosynthesis. The sun is the ultimate energy source for the life processes on earth. Metabolic reactions are fairly complicated and vary from one organism to another. However, these reactions can be classified in three major categories. A schematic diagramof these reactions is presented in Fig. 5.1. The major categories are (I) degradation of nu-trients, (II) biosynthesis of small molecules (amino acids, nucleotides), and (III) biosyn-thesis of large molecules. These reactions take place in the cell simultaneously. As a resultof metabolic reactions, end products are formed and released from the cells. These endproducts (organic acids, amino acids, antibiotics) are often valuable products for humanand animal consumption. Energy in biological systems is primarily stored and transferred via adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which contains high-energy phosphate bonds. The active form of ATP is complexed with Mg 2+. The standard free-energy charge for the hydrolysis of ATP is 7.3 kcal/mol. The actual free-energy release in the cell may besubstantially higher because the concentration of ATP is often much greater than that forADP. (5.1) Biological energy is stored in ATP by reversing this reaction to form ATP from ADP and P i. Similarly, ADP dissociates to release energy. (5.2) Analog compounds of transfer high-energy phos-phate bonds, but not to the extent of ATP.

Energy stored in ATP is later transferrded to lower-energy phos- phate compounds such as glucose-6-phosphate and glycerol-3-phosphate, as depicted in Fig. 5.2. Figure 5.1.

The oxidation- reduction reaction described is readily reversible. NADH can donate electrons to certaincompounds and accept from others, depending on the oxidation-reduction potential of thecompounds. NADH has two major functions in biological systems: 1.Reducing power: NADH and NADPH supply hydrogen in in metabolism: The electrons (or H atoms) carried by NADH are transferred to oxygen via a series of intermediate compounds (respira-tory chain). The energy released from this electron transport results in the informa-tion of up to three ATP molecules. ATP can be formed from the reducing power in NADH in the absence of oxygen if an alternative electron acceptor is available(e.g., NO - 3). Some research suggests that the theoretical limit may be 2.5 ATP for each NADH, rather than 3. Figure 5.3. Structure of the oxidation-reduction coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinu- cleotide (NAD). In NADP, a phosphate group is present, as indicated. Both NAD andNADP undergo oxidation-reduction as shown. (With permission, from T. D. Brock, D. W.Smith, and M. T. Madigan, Biology of Microorganisms , 4th ed., Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1984, p. 104.) 136 Major Metabolic Pathways GLYCOLYSIS AND THE TCA CYCLE Glucose is a major carbon and energy source for many organisms. Several different meta- bolic pathways are used by different organisms for the catabolism of glucose. The catabo-lism of glucose by glycolysis , or the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, is the primary pathway in many organisms. Other pathways, such as the hexose monophosphate (HMP) and Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways, will be covered later. Aerobic catabolism of organic compounds such as glucose may be considered in three different phases: 1.EMP pathway for fermentation of glucose to pyruvate. 2.Krebs , tricarboxylic acid (TCA) , or citric conversion of pyruvate to CO 2and NADH. 3.Respiratory or electron transport chain for formation of ATP by transferring elec- trons from NADH to an electron acceptor. The final phase, respiration, changes reducing power into a biologically useful en- ergy form (ATP). Respiration may be aerobic or anaerobic, depending on the final elec- tron acceptor. If oxygen is used as final electron acceptor, the respiration is called aerobic respiration . When other electron acceptors, such as NO- 3, SO3- 4 , Fe3+, Cu2+, anaerobic respiration . Glycolysis or the EMP pathway results in the breakdown of glucose to two pyruvate molecules. The enzymatic reaction sequence involved in glycolysis is presented inFig. 5.4. The first step in glycolysis is phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate(G-6P) by hexokinase. Phosphorylated glucose can be kept inside the cell. Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose-6-phosphate (F-6P) by phosphoglucose isomerase,which is to fructose 1,6-diphosphate by phosphofructokinase. The first and thethird reactions are the only two ATP-consuming reactions in glycolysis. They are irre-versible. The breakdown into dihydroxyacetone phosphate(DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA-3P) by aldolase is one of key steps inglycolysis (e.g., C 6to 2 C3). DHAP and GA-3P are in equilibrium. As GA-3P is utilized in glycolysis, DHAP is continuously converted to GA-3P. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate isfirst oxidized with the addition of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate (1,3-dP-GA) by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1,3-dP-GA releases onephosphate group to is converted to 3-phosphoglycerate (3P-GA)by 3-phosphoglycerate of 2P-GA to phosphenol pyruvate(PEP) by enolase is the next is further dephosphorylated to pyruvate (Pyr) bypyruvate kinase, with the formation of an ATP. Reactions after DHAP and GA-3P forma-tion repeat twice during glycolysis. The end-product pyruvate is key metabolite in metabolism. Under anaerobic con- ditions, pyruvate may be converted to lactic acid, ethanol, or other products, such as ace-tone, butanol, and acetic acid. Anaerobic conversion of glucose to the aforementionedcompounds used to be known as fermentation . However, that term today covers a whole Sec. 5.3 Glucose Metabolism: Glycolysis and the TCA Cycle 137ch05 10/11/01 5:12 PM Page 137Figure 5.4. Reactions involved in the breakdown of glucose by glycolysis. (With per- mission, from T. D. Brock, D. W. Smith, and M. T.

The overall reaction in glycolysis is glucose +2 net yield glycolysis is 2 mol ATP/glucose under anaerobic conditions. Pyruvate produced in the EMP pathway transfers its reducing power to NAD+via the Krebs cycle. Glycolysis takes place in cytoplasm, whereas the site for the Krebs cycleis the matrix of mitochondria in eucaryotes. In procaryotes, these reactions are associatedwith membrane-bound enzymes. Entry into the Krebs cycle is provided by the acylationof coenyzme-A by pyruvate. (5.5) Acetyl CoA is transferred through mitochondrial membrane at the expense of the conver- sion of the two NADHs produced in glycolysis to 2 FADH. Acetyl CoA is a key interme-diate in the metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids. The reactions involved in the TCA cycle are presented in Fig. 5.5. Condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetic acid results in citric acid, which is further converted to iso-citric acid and then to a-ketoglutaric acid ( a-KGA) with a release of CO 2. a-KGA is de- carboxylated and oxidized to succinic acid (SA), which is further oxidized to fumaric acid(FA). Hydration of fumaric acid to malic acid oxidation of malic acid to ox-aloacetic acid (OAA) are the two last steps of the TCA cycle. For each pyruvate moleculeentering the cycle, three CO 2, four NADH +H+, and one FADH2are produced. The succi- nate and a-ketoglutarate produced during the TCA cycle are used as precursors for the synthesis of certain amino acids. The reducing power (NADH +H+and FADH2) produced is used either for biosynthetic pathways or for ATP generation through the electron trans-port chain. The overall reaction of the TCA cycle is acetyl-CoA +3 from Fig. 5.5 that GTP can be converted easily into ATP; some descriptions of the TCA cycle show directly the conversion of ADP plus phosphorus into ATP, as succinylCoA is converted to succinate. The major roles of the TCA cycle are (1) to provide electrons (NADH) for the elec- tron transport chain and biosynthesis, (2) to supply C skeletons for amino acid synthesis,and (3) to generate energy. Many of the intermediates in the TCA cycle are used extensively in biosynthesis. Removal of these intermediates \"short-circuits\" the TCA cycle. To maintain a functioningTCA cycle, the cell can fix CO 2(heterotrophic CO2fixation). In some microbes, phospho- enolpyruvate (PEP) can be combined with CO2to yield oxalacetate. Three enzymes that can catalyze such a conversion have been found (PEP carboxylase, PEP carboxykinase,and PEP carboxytransphosphorylase). Pyruvate can be combined with 2to 139ch05 10/11/01 5:12 PM Page 139Figure 5.5. Krebs or TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle with energy yields based on eucaryotic cells. (With permission, from T. D.

When a culture is initiated at low density (i.e., few cells per unit volume) with little accumula-tion of intracellular CO 2, or when a gas sparge rate into a fermentation tank is high, then growth may be limited by the rate of CO2fixation to maintain the TCA cycle. 5.4. RESPIRATION The respiration reaction sequence is also known as the electron transport chain. The process of forming ATP from the electron transport chain is known as oxidative phospho- rylation . Electrons carried by NADH +H+and FADH2are transferred to oxygen via a se- ries of electron carriers, and ATPs are formed. Three ATPs are formed from each NADH + H+and two ATPs for each FADH2in eucaryotes. The details of the respiratory (cy- tochrome) chain are depicted in Fig. 5.6. The major role of the electron transport chain isto regenerate NADs for glycolysis and ATPs for biosynthesis. The term P/O ratio is usedto indicate the number of phosphate bonds made (ADP +Pi \u00c6ATP) for each oxygen atom used as an electron acceptor (e.g., /onenumeratorcentered/twodenominatorcentered O 2+NADH +H+\u00c6H2O +NAD+). Formation of NADH +H+, FADH2, and ATP at different stages of the aerobic ca- tabolism of glucose are summarized in Table 5.1. The overall reaction (assuming 3 ATP/NADH) of aerobic glucose catabolism The energy deposited in 36 mol of ATP is 263 kcal/mol glucose. The free-energy change in the direct oxidation of glucose is 686 kcal/mol glucose. Therefore, the energyefficiency of glycolysis is 38% under standard conditions. With the correction for non-standard conditions, this efficiency is estimated to be greater than 60%, which is signifi-cantly higher than the efficiency of man-made machines. The remaining energy stored inglucose is dissipated as heat. However, in procaryotes the conversion of the reducingpower to ATP is less efficient. The number of ATP generated from NADH +H +is usually \u00a3 2, and only one ATP may be generated from FADH2. Thus, in procaryotes a single glu- cose molecule will yield less than 24 ATP, and the P/O ratio is generally between 1 and 2. The yield is about 30 ATP if we assume 2.5 ATP/NADH.TABLE 5.1 Summary of NADH, FADH2, and ATP Formation during Aerobic Catabolism of Glucose (Based on Consumption of 1 Mole of Glucose) NADH FADH2 ATP Total ATPa Glycolysis 2 - 2 6b Oxidative decarboxylation 2 - - 6 of pyruvate TCA cycle 6 2 2 24 Total 10 2 4 36 mol ATP aAssumes a P/O ratio of 3 (i.e., 3 ATP phosphates made for each proton transported by the electron transport chain) for NADH and a P/O ratio of 2 for each FADH2. bThe yield is 6 ATP rather than 8 because 2 NADH are converted to 2 FADH2for the transfer of acetyl CoA into mitochondria.

The major control site in glycolysis is enzyme activated by ADP and Pi, but in- activated by ATP. Figure 5.6. Electron transport and electron transport phosphorylation. Top: Oxidation of NADH and the flow of electrons through the electron transport system, leading to thetransfer of protons (H +) from the inside to the outside of the membrane. The tendency of protons to return to the inside is called proton-motive force . Bottom: ATP synthesis occurs as protons reenter the cell. An ATPase enzyme uses the proton-motive force for the syn-thesis of ATP. The proton-motive force is discussed in Section 4.7. (With permission, fromT. D. Brock, K. M. Brock, and D. M. Ward, Basic Microbiology with Applications , 3d ed., Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1986, p. 71.) 142 Major Metabolic Pathways Chap. 5ch05 10/11/01 ratios, this enzyme is inactivated, resulting in a reduced rate of glycoly- sis and reduced ATP synthesis. The concentration of dissolved oxygen or oxygen partial pressure has a regulatory effect on rate of glycolysis, known as the Pasteur effect . The rate of glycolysis under anaerobic conditions is higher than that under aerobic conditions. In the presence of oxy-gen, ATP yield is high, since the TCA cycle and electron transport chain are operating. Asa result of high levels of ATP, ADP and Pi become limiting, and phosphofructokinase be-comes inhibited. Also, some enzymes of glycolysis with \u2014SH groups are inhibited byhigh levels of oxygen. A high NADH/NAD +ratio also reduces the rate of glycolysis. Certain enzymes of the Krebs cycle are also regulated by feedback inhibition. Pyru- vate dehydrogenase is inhibited by ATP, NADH, and acetyl CoA and activated by ADP,AMP, and NAD +. Similarly, citrate synthase is inactivated by ATP and activated by ADP and AMP; succinyl CoA synthetase is inhibited by NAD+. In general, high ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD+ratios reduce the processing rate of the TCA cycle. Several steps in the electron transport chain are inhibited by cyanide, azide, carbon monoxide, and certain antibiotics, such as amytal. Such inhibition is important due to itspotential to alter cellular metabolism. 5.6. METABOLISM OF NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDS Most of the organic nitrogen compounds have an oxidation level between carbohydrates and lipids. Consequently, nitrogenous compounds can be used as nitrogen, carbon, andenergy source. Proteins are hydrolyzed to peptides and further to amino acids by pro-teases. Amino acids are first converted to organic acids by deamination (removal of aminogroup). Deamination reaction may be oxidative, reductive, enzyme systems deamination can be representedas follows: (5.10) Ammonia released from deamination is utilized in protein and nucleic acid synthe- sis as a nitrogen source, and organic acids can be further oxidized for energy production(ATP). Transamination is another mechanism for conversion of amino acids to organic acids and other amino acids. The amino group is exchanged for the keto group of a-keto acid. A typical transamination reaction is acid +oxaloacetic \u00e6\u00c6 a -keto glutaric acid +aspartic acid (5.11) Nucleic acids can also be utilized by many organisms as carbon, nitrogen, and en- ergy source.

Sugar molecules are metabolized by glycolysis and the TCAcycle, producing CO 2and H2O under aerobic conditions. Phosphoric acids are used in ATP, phospholipid, and nucleic acid synthesis. Purines/pyrimidines are degraded into urea and acetic acid and then to ammonia and CO2.

Certain cyanobacteria, such as Anabaena sp., fix nitrogen under aerobic conditions. The lichens are associations of cyanobacteria and fungi. Cyanobacteria provide nitrogen to fungi by fixing atmospheric nitrogen. Rhizobium species are heterotrophic organisms growing in the roots of leguminous plants. Rhizobium fix atmospheric nitrogen under low oxygen pressure and provide ammonium to plants.Rhizobium and Azospirillum are widely used for agricultural purposes and are bioprocess products. 5.8. METABOLISM OF HYDROCARBONS The metabolism of aliphatic hydrocarbons is important in some bioprocesses and often critical in applications such as bioremediation. Such metabolism requires oxygen, andonly few organisms (e.g., Pseudomonas , Mycobacteria , certain yeasts and molds) can me- tabolize hydrocarbons. The low solubility of hydrocarbons in water is a barrier to rapidmetabolism. The first step in metabolism of aliphatic hydrocarbons is oxygenation by oxyge- nases. Hydrocarbon molecules are converted to an alcohol by incorporation of oxygeninto the end of the carbon skeleton. The alcohol molecule is further oxidized to aldehyde 144 Major Metabolic Pathways Chap. 5ch05 10/11/01 5:12 PM Page 144and then to an organic acid which is further converted to acetyl-CoA, which is metabo- lized by the TCA cycle. Oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons takes place by the action of oxygenases and proceeds much slower than those of aliphatic hydrocarbons. Cathecol is the key interme-diate in this oxidation sequence and can be further broken down ultimately to acetyl-CoAor TCA cycle intermediates. Aerobic metabolism of benzene is depicted below: (5.15) Anaerobic metabolism of hydrocarbons is more difficult. Only a few organisms can me- tabolize hydrocarbons under anaerobic conditions. They cleave the C -C bonds and satu- rate with hydrogen to yield methane. 5.9. OVERVIEW OF BIOSYNTHESIS The TCA cycle and glycolysis are critical catabolic pathways and also provide important precursors for the biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids, and polysaccharides.Although many additional pathways exist, we will describe just two more, one in the con-text of biosynthesis and the other under anaerobic metabolism. The first is the pentose-phosphate pathway or hexose-monophosphate pathway (HMP) (see Fig. 5.7). Although this pathway produces significant reducing power, whichcould be used, in principle, to supply energy to the cell, its primary role is to provide car-bon skeletons for biosynthetic reactions and the reducing power necessary to support an-abolism. Normally, NADPH is used in biosynthesis, whereas NADH is used in energyproduction. This pathway provides an array of small organic compounds with three, four,five, and seven carbon atoms. These compounds are particularly important for the synthe-sis of ribose, purines, coenzymes, and the aromatic amino acids. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate formed can be oxidized to yield energy through conversion to pyruvate andfurther oxidation of pyruvate in the TCA cycle. A vital component of biosynthesis, which consumes a large amount of cellular building blocks, is the production of amino acids. Many amino acids are also importantcommercial products, and the alteration of pathways to induce overproduction (see Chap-ter 4) is critical to commercial success. The 20 amino acids can be grouped into variousfamilies. Figure 5.8 summarizes these families and the compounds from which they arederived. The amino acid, histidine, is not included in Fig. 5.8. Its biosynthesis is fairlycomplicated and cannot be easily grouped with the others. However, ribose-5-phosphatefrom HMP is a key precursor in its synthesis. In addition to the synthesis of amino acids and nucleic acids, the cell must be able to synthesize lipids and polysaccharides. The key precursor is acetyl-CoA (see Fig. 5.5 for theTCA cycle). Fatty acid synthesis consists of the stepwise buildup of acetyl-CoA. Also, CO 2 is an essential component in fatty acid biosynthesis. Acetyl-CoA and CO2produce malomyl-CoA, which is a intermediate in fatty acid synthesis. Thisrequirement for CO 2can lengthen the start-up phase (or lag phase; see 145ch05 10/11/01 5:12 PM Page 145mercial fermentations if the system is not operated carefully. The requirement for CO2can be eliminated if the medium is formulated to supply key lipids, such as oleic acid. The synthesis of most of the polysaccharides from glucose or other hexoses is read- ily accomplished in most organisms. However, if the carbon energy source has less thansix carbons, special reactions need to be used. Essentially, the EMP pathway needs to beoperated in reverse to produce glucose. The production of glucose is called gluconeogene- sis. Since several of the key steps in the EMP pathway are irreversible, the cell must cir- 146 Major Metabolic Pathways Chap. 5 Figure 5.7.

Since pyruvate can be synthesized from a wide variety of pathways, it is the starting point. However, in gly-colysis the final step to convert phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate is irreversible.In gluconeogenesis, reactions in glycolysis are reversible (under appropriate conditions) up to the forma- tion of fructose-1,6-diphosphate. To complete glucogenesis, two enzymes (fructose-1,6-diphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase) not in the EMP pathway are required. Thus,an organism with these two enzymes and the ability to complete reaction 5.19 should beable to grow a wide variety of nonhexose carbon-energy sources. So far we have concentrated on aerobic metabolism. Many of the reactions we have described would be operable under anaerobic conditions. The primary feature of anaero-bic metabolism is energy production in the absence of oxygen and in most cases theabsence of other external electron acceptors. The cell must also balance its generation andconsumption of reducing power. In the next section we show how the pathways we havediscussed can be adapted to the constraints of anaerobic metabolism.

Sec. 5.9 Overview of Biosynthesis 147ch05 10/11/01 5:12 PM Page 1475.10. OVERVIEW OF ANAEROBIC METABOLISM The production of energy in the absence of oxygen can be accomplished by anaerobic respiration (see also Section 5.2). The same pathways as employed in aerobic metabolism can be used; the primary difference is the use of an alternative electron acceptor. One ex-cellent example is the use of nitrate NO - 3, which can act as an electron acceptor. Its prod- uct, nitrous oxide (N2O-), is also an acceptor leading to the formation of dinitrogen (N2). This process, denitrification , is an important process environmentally. Many advanced bi- ological waste-treatment systems are operated to promote denitrification. Many organisms grow without using the electron transport chain. The generation of energy without the electron transport chain is called fermentation . This definition is the exact and original meaning of the term fermentation, although currently it is often used ina broader context. Since no electron transport is used, the organic substrate must undergoa balanced series of oxidative and reductive reactions. This constraint requires that therates of conversion of NAD +and NADP+to NADH and NADPH must equal the rates of conversion of NADH and NADPH to NAD+and NADP+. For example, with the EMP pathway the 2 mol of NAD reduced in this pathway in the production of pyruvate arereoxidized by oxidation of pyruvate to other products. Two prime examples are lacticacid and ethanol production (see Fig. 5.9). Both lactic acid and ethanol are important Figure 5.9. Comparison between (a) lactic acid and (b) alcoholic fermentations.

Figure 5.10 summarizes common routes to some of these fermentation end prod- ucts. Pyruvate is a key metabolite in these pathways. most cases, pyruvate is formedthrough glycolysis. However, alternative pathways to form pyruvate exist. The most com-mon of these is the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (see Fig. 5.11). This pathway is important in the fermentation of glucose by the bacterium Zymomonas . The use of Zymomonas to convert glucose into ethanol is of potential commercial interest, because the use of theEntner-Doudoroff pathway produces only 1 mol of ATP per mole of glucose. This low en-ergy yield forces more glucose into ethanol and less into cell mass than for yeast, whichuses glycolysis to produce pyruvate, which yields 2 mol ATP per mole of glucose. No one organism makes all the products indicated in Fig. 5.10. Different organisms will contain different combinations of pathways. Thus, it is important to screen a wide va- Figure 5.10.

OVERVIEW OF AUTOTROPHIC METABOLISM So far we have been concerned primarily with heterotrophic growth (e.g., organic mole- cules serve as carbon-energy sources). However, autotrophs obtain nearly all their carbon from CO2. Most autotrophs (either photoautotrophs or chemoautotrophs) fix or molecules of glyceric acid- 3-phosphate. This is the key step in the Calvin cycle (or Calvin-Benson cycle). This cycle is summarized in Fig. 5.12 and provides the building blocks for autotrophic growth. Energy for autotrophic growth can be supplied by light (photoautotroph) or chemi- cals (chemoautotroph). Here we consider the special case of photoautotrophic growth. Figure 5.11. Entner-Doudoroff pathway. (With permission, from T. D. Brock. D. W.Smith, and M. T.

The overall reaction is (5.19) The first phase of photosynthesis is known as the light phase . Light energy is cap- tured and converted into biochemical energy in the form of ATP and reducing agents, suchas NADPH. In this process, hydrogen atoms are removed from water molecules and areused to reduce NADP, leaving behind molecular oxygen. Simultaneously, ADP is phos-phorylated to ATP. The light-phase reaction of photosynthesis is (5.20) In the second phase, the energy-rich products of the first phase, NADPH and ATP, are used as the sources of energy to reduce the CO 2to yield glucose (see Fig 5.12). Simul- taneously, NADPH is reoxidized to NADP+, and the ATP is converted into ADP and phos- phate. This dark phase is CO2by photosynthesis. In procaryotes (e.g., cyanobacteria), photosynthesis takes place in stacked membranes, whereas in eu-caryotes an organelle called the chloroplast conducts photosynthesis. Both systems con- tain chlorophyll to absorb light. Light absorption by chlorophyll molecules results in anelectronic excitation. The excited chlorophyll molecule returns to the normal state byemitting light quanta in a process known as fluorescence . The excited chlorophyll donates an electron to a sequence of enzymes, and ATP is produced as the electrons travel throughthe chain. This ATP generation process is called photophosphorylation . Electron carriers in this process are ferrodoxin and several cytochromes.H O NADP P ADP oxygen NADPH ATPilight 2 ++ + + + +++ \u00e6\u00c6 \u00e6\u00e666 622 6 1 2 62CO H O C H O Olight++ \u00e6\u00c6 \u00e6\u00e6 Figure Schematic phases: CO and regeneration of the CO2 acceptor.

Sec. 5.11 Overview of Autotrophic Metabolism 151ch05 10/11/01 5:12 PM Page 151The light phase of photosynthesis consists of two photosystems. Photosystem I (PS I) can be excited by light of wavelength shorter than 700 nm and generates NADPH.Photosystem II (PS II) requires light of wavelength shorter than 680 nm and splits H 2O into /onenumeratorcentered/twodenominatorcentered O2+2 H+. ATPs are formed as electrons flow from PS II to PS I. 5.12. SUMMARY Cellular metabolism is concerned with two primary functions: catabolism and anabolism . Catabolism involves the degradation of a substrate to more highly oxidized end productsfor the purpose of generating energy and reducing power. Anabolism is the biosynthesisof more complex compounds from simpler compounds, usually with the consumption ofenergy and reducing power. The key compound to store and release energy is adenosinetriphosphate or ATP. Reducing power is stored of the most important pathways in the cell are (1) the Embden- Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, or glycolysis , which converts glucose into pyruvate; (2) the tricarboxylic acid cycle , which can oxidize pyruvate through acetyl-CoA into CO 2 and H2O; and (3) the pentose-phosphate or hexose-monophosphate (HMP) pathway, which converts glucose-6-phosphate into a of skeletons (C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7), with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate as the end product. Although all three pathways can have catabolic and anabolic roles, the EMP pathway and TCA cycle are the primarymeans for energy generation, and HMP plays a key role in supplying carbon skeletons andreducing power for direct use in biosynthesis. In this chapter we have briefly consideredthe relationship of these pathways to amino acid, fatty acid, and polysaccharide biosyn-thesis. The conversion of pyruvate to glucose, necessary for polysaccharide biosynthesiswhen the carbon source does not have six carbons, is called glucogenesis . Reducing power can be used to generate ATP through the electron transport chain . If oxygen is the final electron acceptor for this reducing power, the process is called aero- bic respiration . If another electron acceptor is used in conjunction with the electron trans- port chain, then the process is called anaerobic respiration . Cells that obtain energy without using the electron transport chain use fermentation . Substrate-level phospho- rylation supplies ATP. The end products of fermentative metabolism (e.g., ethanol, acetone-butanol, and lactic acid) are important commercially and are formed in responseto the cell's need to balance consumption and the production of reducing power. Autotrophic organisms use CO 2as their carbon source and rely on the Calvin (or Calvin-Benson ) cycle to incorporate (or fix) carbon from CO2into cellular material. Energy is obtained either through light ( photoautotroph ) pathways in E. coli . (Adapted from J. D. Watson, Molecular Biology of the Gene, 2d ed., W. A.

INTRODUCTION For microbes, growth is their most essential response to their physiochemical environ- ment. Growth is a result of both replication and change in cell size. Microorganisms cangrow under a variety of physical, chemical, and nutritional conditions. In a suitable nutri-ent medium, organisms extract nutrients from the medium and convert them into biologi-cal compounds. Part of these nutrients are used for energy production and part are usedfor biosynthesis and product formation. As a result of nutrient utilization, microbial massincreases with time and can be described simply by (6.1) Microbial growth is a good example of an autocatalytic reaction. The rate of growth is di- rectly related to cell concentration, and cellular reproduction is the normal outcome of thisreaction. The rate of microbial growth is characterized by the net specific growth rate , de- fined as (6.2a) mnet 1 XdX dtsubstrates cells -- extracellular products more cells S X -- P X+\u00c6 + +\u00c6 + SS n6 How Cells Growch06 PM Page 155156 How Cells Grow Chap. 6(6.2b) where Xis cell mass concentration ( g/l), tis time (h), and mnetis net specific growth rate (h-1). The net specific growth is the difference between a gross specific growth rate, mg (h-1), and the rate of loss of cell mass due to cell death or endogenous metabolism, kd(h-1). Microbial growth can also be described in terms of cell number concentration, N, as well as X. In that case (6.3) where mRis the net specific replication rate (h-1). If we ignore cell death, kd, then we use the symbol m\u00a2R;and in cases where cell death is unimportant, mRwill equal m\u00a2R. In this chapter we will discuss how the specific growth rate changes with its envi- ronment. First, we will consider growth in batch culture, where growth conditions areconstantly changing. 6.2. BATCH GROWTH Batch growth refers to culturing cells in a vessel with an initial charge of medium that is not altered by further nutrient addition or removal. This form of cultivation is simple andwidely used both in the laboratory and industrially. 6.2.1. Quantifying Cell Concentration The quantification of cell concentration in a culture medium is essential for the determina- tion of the kinetics and stoichiometry of microbial growth. The methods used in the quan-tification of cell concentration can be classified in two categories: direct and indirect. Inmany cases, the direct methods are not feasible due to the presence of suspended solids orother interfering compounds in the medium. Either cell number or cell mass can be quan-tified depending on the type of information needed and the properties of the system. Cellmass concentration is often preferred to the measurement of cell number density whenonly one is measured, but the combination of the two measurements is often desirable. 6.2.1.1. Determining cell number density. A Petroff-Hausser slide or a hemocytometer is often used for direct cell counting. In this method, a calibrated grid is placed over the culture chamber, and the number of cells per grid square is counted usinga microscope. To be statistically reliable, at least 20 grid squares must be counted and av-eraged. The culture medium should be clear and free of particles that could hide cells orbe confused with cells. Stains can be used to distinguish between dead and live cells. Thismethod is suitable for nonaggregated cultures. It is difficult to count molds under the mi-croscope because of their mycelial nature. Plates containing appropriate growth medium gelled with agar (Petri dishes) are used for counting viable cells. (The word viable used in this context means capable of reproduc- tion.) Culture samples are diluted and spread on the agar surface and the plates are incu-bated. Colonies are counted on the agar surface following the incubation period. The resultsare expressed in terms of colony-forming units (CFU). If cells form aggregates, then a g =- kdch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 156colony may not be formed from a single cell. This method ( plate counts ) is more suitable for bacteria and yeasts and much less suitable for molds. A large number of colonies must becounted to yield a statistically reliable number. Growth media have to be selected carefully,since some media support growth better than others. The viable count may vary, depending on the composition of the growth medium. From a single cell, it may require 25 generationsto form an easily observable colony. Unless the correct medium and culture conditions arechosen, some cells that are metabolically active may not form colonies. In an alternative method, an agar-gel medium is placed in a small ring mounted on a microscope slide, and cells are spread on this miniature culture dish. After an incubationperiod of a few doubling times, the slide is examined with a microscope to count cells.This method has many of the same limitations as plate counts, but it is more rapid, andcells capable of only limited reproduction will be counted. Another method is based on the relatively high electrical resistance of cells (Fig. 6.1). Commercial particle counters employ two electrodes and an electrolyte solu- tion. One electrode is placed in a tube containing an orifice. A vacuum is applied to theinner tube, which causes an electrolyte solution containing the cells to be sucked throughthe orifice. An electrical potential is applied across the electrodes. As cells pass throughthe orifice, the electrical resistance increases and causes pulses in electrical voltage. Thenumber of pulses is a measure of the number of particles; particle concentration is known,since the counter is activated for a predetermined sample volume. The height of the pulseis a measure of cell size. Probes with various orifice sizes are used for different cell sizes.This method is suitable for discrete cells in a particulate-free medium and cannot be usedfor mycelial organisms. The number of particles in solution can be determined from the measurement of scattered light intensity with the aid of a phototube (nephelometry). Light passes through Figure 6.1. Diagram of a particle counter using the electrical resistance method formeasuring cell number and cell size distribu-tion. The ratio of volumes of a nonconduct-ing particle to the orifice volume (altered bychanging orifice diameter) determines thesize of the voltage pulse. (Adapted with per-mission, from D. I. C. Wang and others, Fer- mentation and Enzyme Technology , John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1979, p. 64.) Sec. 6.2 Batch Growth 157ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 157the culture sample, and a phototube measures the light scattered by cells in the sample. The intensity of the scattered light is proportional to cell concentration. This method givesbest results for dilute cell and particle suspensions. 6.2.1.2. Determining cell mass concentration. Direct methods . Determi- nation of cellular dry weight is the most commonly used direct method for determining cell mass concentration and is applicable only for cells grown in solids-free medium. Ifnoncellular solids, such as molasses solids, cellulose, or corn steep liquor, are present, thedry weight measurement will be inaccurate. Typically, samples of culture broth are cen-trifuged or filtered and washed with a buffer solution or water. The washed wet cell massis then dried at 80 C for 24 hours; then dry cell weight is measured. Packed cell volume is used to rapidly but roughly estimate the cell concentration in a fermentation broth (e.g., industrial antibiotic fermentations). Fermentation broth is cen-trifuged in a tapered graduated tube under standard conditions (rpm and time), and thevolume of cells is measured. Another rapid method is based on the absorption of light by suspended cells in sam- ple culture media. The intensity of the transmitted light is measured using a spectrometer.Turbidity or optical density measurement of the culture medium provides a fast, inexpen- sive, and simple method of estimating cell density in the absence of other solids or light-absorbing compounds. The extent of light transmission in a sample chamber is a functionof cell density and the thickness of the chamber. Light transmission is modulated by bothabsorption and scattering. Pigmented cells give different results than unpigmented ones.Background absorption by components in the medium must be considered, particularly ifabsorbing dissolved species are taken into cells. The medium should be essentially parti-cle free. Proper procedure entails using a wavelength that minimizes absorption bymedium components (600- to 700-nm wavelengths are often used), \"blanking\" againstmedium, and the use of a calibration curve. The calibration curve relates optical density(OD) to dry-weight measurements. Such calibration curves can become nonlinear at highOD values ( > 0.3) and depend to some extent on the physiological state of the cells. Indirect methods . In many fermentation processes, such as mold fermentations, di- rect methods cannot be used. In such cases indirect methods are used, which are basedmainly on the measurement of substrate consumption and/or product formation during thecourse of growth. Intracellular components of cells such as RNA, DNA, and protein can be measured as indirect measures of cell growth. During a batch growth cycle, the concentrations ofthese intracellular components change with time. Figure 6.2 depicts the variation of cer-tain intracellular components with time during a batch growth cycle. Concentration ofRNA (RNA/cell weight) varies significantly during a batch growth cycle; however, DNAand protein concentrations remain fairly constant. Therefore, in a complex medium, DNAconcentration can be used as a measure of microbial growth. Cellular protein measure-ments can be achieved using different methods. Total amino acids, Biuret, Lowry (folinreagent), and Kjeldahl nitrogen measurements can be used for this purpose. Total aminoacids and the Lowry method are the most reliable. Recently, protein determination kitsfrom several vendors have been developed for simple and rapid protein measurements. 158 How Cells Grow Chap. 6ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 158Sec. 6.2 Batch Growth 159 Figure 6.2.

Microbiol. 31 :927, 1975 and National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa.)ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 159However, many media contain proteins as substrates, which limits the usefulness of this approach. The intracellular ATP concentration (mg ATP/mg cells) is approximately constant for a given organism. Thus, the ATP concentration in a fermentation broth can be used as a mea-sure of biomass concentration. The method is based on luciferase activity, which catalyzesoxidation of luciferin at the expense of oxygen and ATP with the emission of light. (6.4) When oxygen and luciferin are in excess, total light emission is proportional to total ATP present in the sample. Photometers can be used to detect emitted light. Small concentra-tions of biomass can be measured by this method, since very low concentrations of ATP(10 -12g ATP/l) can be measured by photometers or scintillation counters. The ATP con- tent of a typical bacterial cell is 1 mg ATP/g dry-weight cell, approximately. Sometimes, nutrients used for cellular mass production can be measured to follow microbial growth. Nutrients used for product formation are not suitable for this purpose.Nitrate, phosphate, or sulfate measurements can be used. The utilization of a carbonsource or oxygen uptake rate can be measured to monitor cellular growth when cell massis the major product. The products of cell metabolism can be used to monitor and quantify cellular growth. Certain products produced under anaerobic conditions, such as ethanol and lacticacid, can be related nearly stoichiometrically to microbial growth. Products must be eithergrowth associated (ethanol) or mixed growth associated (lactic acid) to be correlated withmicrobial growth. For aerobic fermentations, CO 2is a common product and can be related to microbial growth. In some cases, changes in the pH or acid-base addition to control pHcan be used to monitor nutrient uptake and microbial growth. For example, the utilizationof ammonium results in the release of hydrogen ions (H +) and therefore a drop in pH. The amount of base added to neutralize the H+released is proportional to ammonium uptake and growth. Similarly, when nitrate is used as the nitrogen source, hydrogen ions are re-moved from the medium, resulting in an increase in pH. In this case, the amount of acidadded is proportional to nitrate uptake and therefore to microbial growth. In some fermentation processes, as a result of mycelial growth or extracellular poly- saccharide formation, the viscosity of the fermentation broth increases during the courseof fermentation. If the substrate is a biodegradable polymer, such as starch or cellulose,then the viscosity of the broth decreases with time as biohydrolysis continues. Changes inthe viscosity of the fermentation broth can be correlated with the extent of microbialgrowth. Although polymeric broths are usually non-Newtonian, the apparent viscositymeasured at a fixed rate can be used to estimate cell or product concentration. 6.2.2. Growth Patterns and Kinetics in Batch Culture When a liquid nutrient medium is inoculated with a seed culture, the organisms selec- tively take up dissolved nutrients from the medium and convert them into biomass. A typi-cal batch growth curve includes the following phases: (1) lag phase, (2) logarithmic orexponential growth phase, (3) deceleration phase, (4) stationary phase, and (5) deathphase. Figure 6.3 describes a batch growth cycle.luciferin O ATP light ++2luciferase 160 How Cells Grow Chap. 6ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 160The lag phase occurs immediately after inoculation and is a period of adaptation of cells to a new environment. Microorganisms reorganize their molecular constituents whenthey are transferred to a new medium. Depending on the composition of nutrients, newenzymes are synthesized, the synthesis of some other enzymes is repressed, and the inter-nal machinery of cells is adapted to the new environmental conditions. These changes re-flect the intracellular mechanisms for the regulation of the metabolic processes discussedin Chapter 4. During this phase, cell mass may increase a little, without an increase in cellnumber density. When the inoculum is small and has a low fraction of cells that are vi-able, there may be a pseudolag phase, which is a result, not of adaptation, but of small in-oculum size or poor condition of the inoculum. Low concentration of some nutrients and growth factors may also cause a long lag phase. For example, the lag phase of Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Aerobacter aero- genes ) grown in glucose and phosphate buffer medium increases as the concentration of Mg 2+, which is an activator of the enzyme phosphatase, is decreased. As another example, even heterotrophic cells require CO2fixation (to supplement intermediates removed from key energy-producing metabolic cycles during rapid biosynthesis), and excessive spargingcan remove metabolically generated CO 2too rapidly for cellular restructuring to be ac- complished efficiently, particularly with a small inoculum. Figure 6.3. Typical growth curve for a bacterial population. Note that the phase of growth (shown here for cell number) depends on the parameter used to monitor growth. Sec. 6.2 Batch Growth 161ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 161The age of the inoculum culture has a strong effect on the length of lag phase. The age refers to how long a culture has been maintained in a batch culture. Usually, the lagperiod increases with the age of the inoculum. In some cases, there is an optimal inoculumage resulting in minimum lag period. To minimize the duration of the lag phase, cellsshould be adapted to the growth medium and conditions before inoculation, and cellsshould be young (or exponential phase cells) and active, and the inoculum size should belarge (5% to 10% by volume). The nutrient medium may need to be optimized and certaingrowth factors included to minimize the lag phase. Figure 6.4 shows an example of varia-tion of the lag phase with MgSO 4concentration. Many commercial fermentation plants rely on batch culture; to obtain high productivity from a fixed plant size, the lag phasemust be as short as possible. Multiple lag phases may be observed when the medium contains more than one car- bon source. This phenomenon, known as diauxic growth, is caused by a shift in metabolic pathways in the middle of a growth cycle (see Example 4.1). After one carbon source isexhausted, the cells adapt their metabolic activities to utilize the second carbon source.The first carbon source is more readily utilizable than the second, and the presence ofmore readily available carbon source represses the synthesis of the enzymes required forthe metabolism of the second substrate. The exponential growth phase is also known as the logarithmic growth phase . In this phase, the cells have adjusted to their new environment. After this adaptation period,cells can multiply rapidly, and cell mass and cell number density increase exponentiallywith time. This is a period of balanced growth, in which all components of a cell grow at the same rate. That is, the average composition of a single cell remains approximatelyconstant during this phase of growth. During balanced growth, the net specific growth rate Figure 6.4.

Since the nutrient concentrations are large in this phase, the growth rate is independent of nutrient concen-tration. The exponential growth rate is first order: (6.5) Integration of eq. 6.5 yields (6.6) where Xand X 0are cell concentrations at time tand t=0. The time required to double the microbial mass is given by eq. 6.6. The exponential growth is characterized by a straight line on a semilogarithm plot of ln Xversus time: (6.7) where tdis the doubling time of cell mass. Similarly, we can calculate a doubling time based on cell numbers and the net spe- cific rate of replication. Thus (6.8) where t\u00a2dis the doubling time based on the replication rate. During balanced growth td will equal t\u00a2d,since the average cell composition and size will not change with time. The deceleration growth phase follows the exponential phase. In this phase, growth decelerates due to either depletion of one or more essential nutrients or the accumulationof toxic by-products of growth. For a typical bacterial culture, these changes occur over avery short period of time. The rapidly changing environment results in unbalanced growth . During unbalanced growth, cell composition and size will change and t dand t\u00a2d will notbe equal. In the exponential phase, the cellular metabolic control system is set to achieve maximum rates of reproduction. In the deceleration phase, the stresses induced bynutrient depletion or waste accumulation cause a restructuring of the cell to increase theprospects of cellular survival in a hostile environment. These observable changes are theresult of the molecular mechanisms of repression and induction that we discussed inChapter 4. Because of the rapidity of these changes, cell physiology under conditions ofnutrient limitation is more easily studied in continuous culture, as discussed later in thischapter. The stationary phase starts at the end of the deceleration phase, when the net growth rate is zero (no cell division) or when the growth rate is equal to the death rate.Even though the net growth rate is zero during the stationary phase, cells are still metabol-ically active and produce secondary metabolites. Primary metabolites are growth-related products and secondary metabolites are nongrowth-related. In fact, the production of certain metabolites is enhanced during the stationary phase (e.g., antibiotics, some hor-mones) due to metabolite deregulation. During the course of the stationary phase, one ormore of the following phenomena may take place:\u00a2= tmd Rln 2 t == =mnet 0 6.2 Batch Growth 163ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 1631.Total cell mass concentration may stay constant, but the number of viable cells may decrease. 2.Cell lysis may occur and viable cell mass may drop. A second growth phase may occur and cells may grow on lysis products of lysed cells (cryptic growth). 3.Cells may not be growing but may have active metabolism to produce secondary metabolites. Cellular regulation changes when concentrations of certain metabolites(carbon, nitrogen, phosphate) are low. Secondary metabolites are produced as a re-sult of metabolite deregulation. During the stationary phase, the cell catabolizes cellular reserves for new building blocks and for energy-producing monomers. This is called endogenous metabolism . The cell must always expend energy to maintain an energized membrane (i.e., proton-motiveforce) and transport of nutrients and for essential metabolic functions such as motility andrepair of damage to cellular structures. This energy expenditure is called maintenance en- ergy. The appropriate equation to describe the conversion of cell mass into maintenance energy or the loss of cell mass due to cell lysis during the stationary phase is (6.9) where k dis a first-order rate constant for endogeneous metabolism, and Xsois the cell mass concentration at the beginning of the stationary phase. Because Sis zero, mgis zero in the stationary phase. The reason for termination of growth may be either exhaustion of an essential nutri- ent or accumulation of toxic products. If an inhibitory product is produced and accumu-lates in the medium, the growth rate will slow down, depending on inhibitor production,and at a certain level of inhibitor concentration, growth will stop. Ethanol production byyeast is an example of a fermentation in which the product is inhibitory to growth. Dilu-tion of toxified medium, addition of an unmetabolizable chemical compound complexingwith the toxin, or simultaneous removal of the toxin would alleviate the adverse effects ofthe toxin and yield further growth. The death phase (or decline phase) follows the stationary phase. However, some cell death may start during the stationary phase, and a clear demarcation between thesetwo phases is not always possible. Often, dead cells lyse, and intracellular nutrients re-leased into the medium are used by the living organisms during stationary phase. At theend of the stationary phase, because of either nutrient depletion or toxic product accumu-lation, the death phase begins. The rate of death usually follows first-order kinetics: (6.10) where N sis the concentration of cells at the end of the stationary phase and k\u00a2dis the first- order death-rate constant. A plot of ln Nversus tyields a line of slope -k\u00a2d. During the death phase, cells may or may not lyse, and the reestablishment of the culture may be pos-sible in the early death phase if cells are transferred into a nutrient-rich medium. In boththe death and stationary phases, it is important to recognize that there is a distribution ofdN dtkN N N ed Grow Chap. 6ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 164properties among individuals in a population. With a narrow distribution, cell death will occur nearly simultaneously; with a broad distribution, a subfraction of the populationmay survive for an extended period. It is this subfraction that would dominate the reestab-lishment of a culture from inoculum derived from stationary or death-phase cultures.Thus, using an old inoculum may select for variants of the original strain having alteredmetabolic capabilities. To better describe growth kinetics, we define some stoichiometrically related pa- rameters. Yield coefficients are defined based on the amount of consumption of anothermaterial. For example, the growth yield in a fermentation is (6.11) At the end of the batch growth period, we have an apparent growth yield (or ob- served growth yield). Because culture conditions can alter patterns of substrate utilization,the apparent growth yield is not a true constant. For example, with a compound (such asglucose) that is both a carbon and energy source, substrate may be consumed as: (6.12) In the section on continuous culture, we will differentiate between the true growth yield (which is constant) and the apparent yield. Yield coefficients based on other sub-strates or product formation may be defined; for example, (6.13) (6.14) For organisms growing aerobically on glucose, Y X/Sis typically 0.4 to 0.6 g/g for most yeast and bacteria, while YX/O2is 0.9 to 1.4 g/g. Anaerobic growth is less efficient, and the yield coefficient is reduced substantially (see Fig. 6.5). With substrates that are more orless reduced than glucose, the value of the apparent yield coefficient will change. Formethane, Y X/Swould assume values of 0.6 to 1.0 g/g, with the corresponding YX/O2decreas- ing to about 0.2 g/g. In most cases the yield of biomass on a carbon-energy source is 1.0 \u00b1 0.4 g biomass per g of carbon consumed. Table 6.1 lists some examples of YX/Sand YX/O2 for a variety of substrates and organisms. A maintenance coefficient is used to describe the specific rate of substrate uptake for cellular maintenance, or (6.15) However, during the stationary phase where little external substrate is available, endoge- neous metabolism of biomass components is used dt Xm -[]YP SPS/ =-D DYX into biomassassimilated into anextracellular productgrowth energy maintenance D 6.2 Batch Growth 165ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 165Cellular maintenance represents energy expenditures to repair damaged cellular components, to transfer some nutrients and products in and out of cells, for motility, andto adjust the osmolarity of the cells' interior volume. Microbial growth, product forma-tion, and substrate utilization rates are usually expressed in the form of specific rates (e.g.,normalized with respect to X), since bioreactions are autocatalytic. The specific rates are used to compare the effectiveness of various fermentation schemes and biocatalysts. Microbial products can be classified in three major categories (see Fig. 6.6): 1.Growth-associated products are produced simultaneously with microbial growth. The specific rate of product formation is proportional to the specific rate of growth,m g. Note that mgdiffers from mnet, the net specific growth rate, when endogeneous metabolism is nonzero. (6.16) The production of a constitutive enzyme is an example of a growth-associated product. 2.Nongrowth-associated product formation takes place during the stationary phase when the growth rate is zero. The specific rate of product formation is constant.qXdP dtYPP X==1 /mg Figure 6.5. Aerobic and anaerobic growth yields of Streptococcus faecalis with glucose as substrate. (With permission, from B.

How Environmental Conditions Affect Growth Kinetics The patterns of microbial growth and product formation we have just discussed are in- fluenced by environmental conditions such as temperature, pH, and dissolved-oxygenconcentration. Temperature is an important factor affecting the performance of cells. According to their temperature optima, organisms can be classified in three groups: 50\u00b0 C). As the temperature is increased toward optimal growth temperature, the growth rateapproximately doubles for every 10\u00b0C increase in temperature. Above the optimal temper-ature range, the growth rate decreases and thermal death may occur. The net specific repli-cation rate can be expressed by the following equation for temperature above optimallevel: (6.19) At high temperatures, the thermal death rate exceeds the growth rate, which causes a net decrease in the concentration of viable cells. Both m\u00a2 Rand k\u00a2dvary with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation: (6.20) where Eaand Edare activation energies for growth and thermal death. The activation en- ergy for growth is typically 10 to 20 kcal/mol, and for thermal death 60 to 80 kcal/mol.That is, thermal death is more sensitive to temperature changes than microbial growth. Temperature also affects product formation. However, the temperature optimum for growth and product formation may be different. The yield coefficient is also affected bytemperature. In some cases, such as single-cell protein production, temperature optimiza-tion to maximize the yield coefficient ( Y X/S) is critical. When temperature is increased above the optimum temperature, the maintenance requirements of cells increase. That is,the maintenance coefficient (see eq. 6.15) increases with increasing temperature with anactivation energy of 15 to 20 kcal/mol, resulting in a decrease in the yield coefficient. Temperature also may affect the rate-limiting step in a fermentation process. At high temperatures, the rate of bioreaction might become higher than the diffusion rate,and diffusion would then become the rate-limiting step (for example, in an immobilizedcell system). The activation energy of molecular diffusion is about 6 kcal/mol. The activa-tion energy for most bioreactions is more than 10 kcal/mol, so diffusional limitations mustbe carefully considered at high temperatures. Figure 6.7 depicts a typical variation ofgrowth rate with temperature. Hydrogen-ion concentration (pH) affects the activity of enzymes and therefore the microbial growth rate. The optimal pH for growth may be different from that for productformation. Generally, the acceptable pH range varies about the optimum by \u00b11 to 2 pH units. Different organisms have different pH optima: the pH optimum for many bacteriaranges from pH =3 to 8; for yeast, pH =3 to 6; for molds, pH =3 to 7; for plant cells, pH =5 to 6; and for animal cells, pH =6.5 to 7.5. Many organisms have mechanisms to\u00a2= \u00a2= \u00a2--mRER T dER TAe k A ead//, dN dtkNR d = \u00a2- \u00a2 ()m 169ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 169maintain intracellular pH at a relatively constant level in the presence of fluctuations in environmental pH. When pH differs from the optimal value, the maintenance-energy re-quirements increase. One consequence of different pH optima is that the pH of themedium can be used to select one organism over another. In most fermentations, pH can vary substantially. Often the nature of the nitrogen source can be important. If ammonium is the sole nitrogen source, hydrogen ions are re-leased into the medium as a result of the microbial utilization of ammonia, resulting in adecrease in pH. If nitrate is the sole nitrogen source, hydrogen ions are removed from themedium to reduce nitrate to ammonia, resulting in an increase in pH. Also, pH can changebecause of the production of organic acids, the utilization of acids (particularly aminoacids), or the production of bases. The evolution or supply of CO 2can alter pH greatly in some systems (e.g., seawater or animal cell culture). Thus, pH control by means of abuffer or an active pH control system is important. Variation of specific growth rate withpH is depicted in Fig. 6.8, indicating a pH optimum. Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important substrate in aerobic fermentations and may be a limiting substrate, since oxygen gas is sparingly soluble in water. At high cell con-centrations, the rate of oxygen consumption may exceed the rate of oxygen supply, lead-ing to oxygen limitations. When oxygen is the rate-limiting factor, specific growth ratevaries with dissolved-oxygen concentration according to saturation kinetics; below a criti-cal concentration, growth or respiration approaches a first-order rate dependence on thedissolved-oxygen concentration. Above a critical oxygen concentration , the growth rate becomes independent of the dissolved-oxygen concentration. Figure 6.9 depicts the variation of specific growth ratewith dissolved-oxygen concentration. Oxygen is a growth-rate-limiting factor when the Figure 6.7. Arrhenius plot of growth rate of E. coli B/r.

In this case, another medium component (e.g., glucose, ammonium) becomes growth-extent limiting. For example, with Azotobac- ter vinelandii at a DO =0.05 mg/l, the growth rate is about 50% of maximum even if a large amount of glucose is present. However, the maximum amount of cells formed is notdetermined by the DO, as oxygen is continually resupplied. If glucose were totally con-sumed, growth would cease even if DO =0.05 mg/l. Thus, the extent of growth (mass of cells formed) would depend on glucose, while the growth rate for most of the culture pe-riod would depend on the value of DO. The critical oxygen concentration is about 5% to 10% of the saturated DO concen- tration for bacteria and yeast and about 10% to 50% of the saturated DO concentration formold cultures, depending on the pellet size of molds. Saturated DO concentration in waterat 25 C and 1 atm pressure is about 7 ppm. The presence of dissolved salts and organics can alter the saturation value, while increasingly high temperatures decrease the saturationvalue. Oxygen is usually introduced to fermentation broth by sparging air through the broth. Oxygen transfer from gas bubbles to cells is usually limited by oxygen transferthrough the liquid film surrounding the gas bubbles. The rate of oxygen transfer from thegas to liquid phase is given by (6.21) where k Lis the oxygen transfer coefficient (cm/h), ais the gas-liquid interfacial is DONk a C CLL O OTR2=- = (* ) Figure 6.8.

Among the various methods used to overcome DO limitations are the use ofoxygen-enriched air or pure oxygen and operation under high atmospheric pressure (2 to3 atm). Oxygen transfer has a big impact on reactor design (see Chapter 10). The redox potential is an important parameter that affects the rate and extent of many oxidative-reductive reactions. In a fermentation medium, the redox potential is acomplex function of DO, pH, and other ion concentrations, such as reducing and oxidiz-ing agents. The electrochemical potential of a fermentation medium can be expressed bythe following equation: (6.25) where the electrochemical potential is measured in millivolts by a pH/voltmeter and P O2is in atmospheres. The redox potential of a fermentation media can be reduced by passing nitrogen gas or by the addition of reducing agents such as cysteine HCl or Na2S. Oxygen gas can be passed or some oxidizing agents can be added to the fermentation media to increase the redox potential. Dissolved carbon dioxide (DCO2) concentration may have a profound effect on per- formance of organisms. Very high DCO2concentrations may be toxic to some cells. On the other hand, cells require a certain DCO2level for proper metabolic functions. The dis- solved carbon dioxide concentration can be controlled by changing the CO2content of the air supply and the agitation speed. The ionic strength of the fermentation media affects the transport of certain nutri- ents in and out of cells, the metabolic functions of cells, and the solubility of certain nutri-ents, such as dissolved oxygen. The ionic strength is given by the following equation: (6.26) where Cis the concentration of an ion, Z iis its charge, and Iis the ionic strength of the medium. High substrate concentrations that are significantly above stoichiometric require- ments are inhibitory to cellular functions. Inhibitory levels of substrates vary dependingon the type of cells and substrate. Glucose may be inhibitory at concentrations above 200g/l (e.g., ethanol fermentation by yeast), probably due to a reduction in water activity.Certain salts such as NaCl may be inhibitory at concentrations above 40 g/l due to highosmotic pressure. Some refractory compounds, such as phenol, toluene, and methanol, areinhibitory at much lower concentrations (e.g., 1 g/l). Typical maximum noninhibitory con-centrations of some nutrients are glucose, 100 g/l; ethanol, 50 g/l for yeast, much less formost organisms; ammonium, 5 g/l; phosphate, 10 g/l; and nitrate, 5 g/l. Substrate inhibi-tion can be overcome by intermittent addition of the substrate to the medium. 6.2.4. Heat Generation by Microbial Growth About 40% to 50% of the energy stored in a carbon and energy source is converted to bio- logical energy (ATP) during aerobic metabolism, and the rest of the energy is released asheat. For actively growing cells, the maintenance requirement is low, and heat evolution isdirectly related Growth 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 173The heat generated during microbial growth can be calculated using the heat of combustion of the substrate and of cellular material. A schematic of an enthalpy balancefor microbial utilization of substrate is presented in Fig. 6.10. The heat of combustion ofthe substrate is equal to the sum of the metabolic heat and the heat of combustion of thecellular material. (6.27a) where DH sis the heat of combustion of the substrate (kJ/g substrate), YX/Sis the substrate yield coefficient (g cell/g substrate), DHcis the heat of combustion of cells (kJ/g cells), and 1/ YHis the metabolic heat evolved per gram of cell mass produced (kJ/g cells). Equation 6.27a can be rearranged to yield (6.27b) DHsand DHccan be determined from the combustion of substrate and cells. Typical DHcvalues for bacterial cells are 20 to 25 kJ/g cells. Typical values of 0.061 g/kcal. Clearly, the degree of oxidation of the substrate has astrong effect on the amount of heat released. The total rate of heat evolution in a batch fermentation is (6.28) where V Lis the liquid volume (l) and Xis the cell concentration (g/l). In aerobic fermentations, the rate of metabolic heat evolution can roughly be corre- lated to the rate of oxygen uptake, since oxygen is the final electron 6.10.

Metabolic heat released during fermentation can be removed by circulating cooling water through a cooling coil or cooling jacket in the fermenter. Often, temperature control(adequate heat removal) is an important limitation on reactor design (see Chapter 10). Theability to estimate heat-removal requirements is essential to proper reactor design. 6.3. QUANTIFYING GROWTH KINETICS 6.3.1. IntroductionIn the previous section we described some key concepts in the growth of cultures. Clearly, we can think of the growth dynamics in terms of kinetic descriptions. It is essential to re-call that cellular composition and biosynthetic capabilities change in response to newgrowth conditions ( unbalanced growth ), although a constant cellular composition and bal- anced growth can predominate in the exponential growth phase. If the decelerating growthphase is due to substrate depletion rather than inhibition by toxins, the growth rate de-creases in relation to decreasing substrate concentrations. In the stationary and deathphases, the distribution of properties among individuals is important (e.g., cryptic death).Although these kinetic ideas are evident in batch culture, they are equally evident and im-portant in other modes of culture (e.g., continuous culture). Clearly, the complete description of the growth kinetics of a culture would involve recognition of the structured nature of each cell and the segregation of the culture into in- dividual units (cells) that may differ from each other. Models can have these same attrib-utes. A chemically structured model divides the cell mass into components. If the ratio ofthese components can change in response to perturbations in the extracellular environ-ment, then the model is behaving analogously to a cell changing its composition in re-sponse to environmental changes. Consider in Chapter 4 our discussion of cellularregulation, particularly the induction of whole pathways. Any of these metabolic re-sponses results in changes in intracellular structure. Furthermore, if a model of a culture isconstructed from discrete units, it begins to mimic the segregation observed in realcultures. Models may be structured and segregated, structured and nonsegregated, un-structured and segregated, and unstructured and nonsegregated. Models containing bothstructure and segregation are the most realistic, but they are also computationallycomplex. The degree of realism and complexity required in a model depends on what is being described; the modeler should always choose the simplest model that can adequately de-scribe the desired system. An unstructured model assumes fixed cell composition, whichis equivalent to assuming balanced growth . The balanced-growth assumption is valid pri- marily in single-stage, steady-state continuous culture and the exponential phase of batchculture; it fails during any transient condition. How fast the cell responds to perturbationsin its environment and how fast these perturbations occur determine whether pseudobal-anced growth can be assumed. If cell response is fast compared to external changes and ifthe magnitude of these changes is not too large (e.g., a 10% or 20% variation from initialconditions), then the use of unstructured models can be justified, since the deviation from Sec. 6.2 Batch Growth 175ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 175balanced growth may be small. Culture response to large or rapid perturbations cannot be described satisfactorily by unstructured models. For many systems, segregation is not a critical component of culture response, so nonsegregated models will be satisfactory under many circumstances. An important ex-ception is the prediction of the growth responses of plasmid-containing cultures (seeChapter 14). Because of the introductory nature of this book, we will concentrate our discussion on unstructured and nonsegregated models. The reader must be aware of the limitationson these models. Nonetheless, such models are simple and applicable to some situationsof practical interest. 6.3.2. Using Unstructured Nonsegregated Models to Predict Specific Growth Rate 6.3.2.1. Substrate-limited growth. As shown in Fig. 6.11, the relationship of specific growth rate to substrate concentration often assumes the form of saturation ki-netics. Here we assume that a single chemical species, S, is growth-rate limiting (i.e., an increase in Sinfluences growth rate, while changes in other nutrient concentrations have no effect). These kinetics are similar to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (or Hougen-Watson)kinetics in traditional chemical kinetics or Michaelis-Menten kinetics for enzyme reac-tions. When applied to cellular systems, these kinetics can be described by the Monod equation: (6.30) where m mis the maximum specific growth rate when S>>Ks. If endogeneous metabolism is unimportant, then mnet =mg. The constant Ksis known as the saturation constant or half- velocity constant and is equal to the concentration of the rate-limiting substrate when the specific rate of growth is equal to one-half of the maximum. That is, Ks=Swhen mg= /onenumeratorcentered/twodenominatorcenteredmmax. In The Monod equation is semiempirical; it derives from the premise that a single enzyme system withMichaelis-Menten kinetics is responsible for uptake of S, and the amount of that enzyme or its catalytic activity is sufficiently low to be growth-rate limiting.mm g=+m sS KS Figure 6.11. Effect of nutrient concentra- tion on the specific growth rate of E. coli. (With permission, from R. Y . Stanier, M. Doudoroff, and E. A. Adelberg, The Microbial World , 5th ed., Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1986, p. 192.) 176 How Cells Grow Chap. 6ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 176This simple premise is if ever, true; however, the Monod equation empiri- cally fits a wide range of data satisfactorily and is the most commonly applied unstruc-tured, nonsegregated model of microbial growth. The Monod equation describes substrate-limited growth only when growth is slow and population density is low. Under these circumstances, environmental conditions canbe related simply to S. If the consumption of a carbon-energy substrate is rapid, then the release of toxic waste products is more likely (due to energy-spilling reactions). At highpopulation levels, the buildup of toxic metabolic by-products becomes more important.The following rate expressions have been proposed for rapidly growing dense cultures: (6.31) or (6.32) where S 0is the initial concentration of the substrate and Ks0is dimensionless. Other equations have been proposed to describe the substrate-limited growth phase. Depending on the shape of m-Scurve, one of these equations may be more plausible than the others. The following equations are alternatives to the Monod equation: (6.33) (6.34) (6.35) (6.36) Although the Blackman equation often fits the data better than the Monod equation, the discontinuity in the Blackman equation is troublesome in many applications. The Tessierequation has two constants ( m m, K), and the Moser equation has three constants ( mm, Ks, n). The Moser equation is the most general form of these equations, and it is equivalent to the Monod equation when n=1. The Contois equation has a saturation constant propor- tional to cell concentration that describes substrate-limited growth at high cell densities.According to this equation, the specific growth rate decreases with decreasing substrateconcentrations and eventually becomes inversely proportional to the cell concentration inthe medium (i.e., m g \u00b5 X-1). These equations can be described by a single 177where u=mg/mm, Sis the rate-limiting substrate concentration, and K, a, and bare constants. The values of these constants are different for each equation and are listed inTable 6.2. The correct rate form to use in the case where more than one substrate is potentially growth-rate limiting is an unresolved question. However, under most circumstances thenoninteractive approach works best: (6.38) where the lowest value of m g(Si) is used. 6.3.2.2. Models with growth inhibitors. At high concentrations of sub- strate or product and in the presence of inhibitory substances in the medium, growth be-comes inhibited, and growth rate depends on inhibitor concentration. The inhibitionpattern of microbial growth is analogous to enzyme inhibition. If a single-substrateenzyme-catalyzed reaction is the rate-limiting step in microbial growth, then kineticconstants in the rate expression are biologically meaningful. Often, the underlying mecha-nism is complicated, and kinetic constants do not have biological meanings and are ob-tained from experimental data by curve fitting. 1.Substrate inhibition: At high substrate concentrations, microbial growth rate is inhibited by the substrate. As in enzyme kinetics, substrate inhibition of growth may becompetitive or noncompetitive. If a single-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the rate-limiting step in microbial growth, then inhibition of enzyme activity results in inhibitionof microbial growth by the same pattern. The major substrate-inhibition patterns and expressions are as follows: (6.39) (6.40) Or then: 6.2 Constants of the Generalized Differential Specific Growth Rate Equation 6.34 for Different Models abK Monod 0 2 1/ 0 1 /Kl/n s Contois 10/11/01 5:19 Page 178(6.41) Note that eq. 6.41 differs from 6.39 and 6.40, and KIin 6.40 and 6.41 differ. Substrate inhibi- tion may be alleviated by slow, intermittent addition of the substrate to the growth medium. 2.Product inhibition: High concentrations of product can be inhibitory for micro- bial growth. Product inhibition may be competitive or noncompetitive, and in some caseswhen the underlying mechanism is not known, the inhibited growth rate is approximatedto exponential or linear decay expressions. Important examples of the product inhibition rate expression are as follows: (6.42) (6.43) Ethanol fermentation from glucose by yeasts is a good example of noncompetitive prod- uct inhibition, and ethanol is the inhibitor at concentrations above about 5%. Other rateexpressions used for ethanol inhibition are (6.44) where P mis the product concentration at which growth stops, or (6.45) where Kpis the product inhibition constant. 3.Inhibition by toxic compounds: The following rate expressions are used for compet- itive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 179(6.48) In some cases, the presence of toxic compounds in the medium results in the inactivation of cells or death. The net specific rate expression in the presence of death has the follow-ing form: (6.49) where k\u00a2 dis the death-rate constant (h-1). 6.3.2.3. The logistic equation. When plotted on arithmetic paper, the batch growth curve assumes a sigmoidal shape (see Fig. 6.3). This shape can be predicted bycombining the Monod equation (6.30) with the growth equation (6.2) and an equation forthe yield of cell mass based on substrate consumption. Combining eqs. 6.30 and 6.2a andassuming no endogenous metabolism yields (6.50) The relationship between microbial growth yield and substrate consumption is (6.51) where X 0and S0are initial values and YX/Sis the cell mass yield based on the limiting nu- trient. Substituting for Sin eq. 6.50 yields the following rate expression: (6.52) The integrated form of the rate expression in this phase is (6.53) This equation describes the sigmoidal-shaped batch growth curve, and the value of X asymptotically reaches to the value of YX/SS0+X0. Equation 6.52 requires a predetermined knowledge of the maximum cell mass in a particular environment. This maximum cell mass we will denote as X; it is identical to the ecological concept of carrying capacity . Equation 6.53 is implicit in its dependence on S. Logistic equations are a set of equations that characterize growth in terms of carry- ing capacity. The usual approach is based on a formulation in which the specific growthrate is related to the amount of unused carrying capacity:() ()ln()ln{( )/ 0000 mdX X X KY Y S X XXmX S X 10/11/01 5:19 180(6.54) Thus, (6.55) eq. 6.55 with the boundary condition X(0) =X0yields the logistic curve. (6.56) Equation 6.56 is represented by the growth curve in Fig. 6.12. Equations of the form of 6.56 can also be generated by assuming that a toxin gener- ated as a by-product of growth limits X(the carrying capacity). Example 6.2 illustrates the use of the logistic approach. Example 6.2.

Filamentous organ- isms such as molds often form microbial pellets at high cell densities in suspension cul-ture. Cells growing inside pellets may be subject to diffusion limitations. The growthmodels of molds should include the simultaneous diffusion and consumption of nutrientswithin the pellet at large pellet sizes. This problem is the same one we face in modelingthe behavior of bacteria or yeasts entrapped in spherical gel particles (see Chapter 9). Alternatively, filamentous cells can grow on the surface of a moist solid. Such growth is usually a complicated process, involving not only growth kinetics but the diffu-sion of nutrients and toxic metabolic by-products. However, for an isolated colony grow-ing on a rich medium, we can ignore some of these complications. In the absence of mass-transfer limitations, it has been observed that the radius of a microbial pellet in a submerged culture or of a mold colony growing on an agar surfaceincreases linearly with time. (6.57) In terms of growth rate of a mold colony, eq. 6.57 can be expressed as (6.58a) pr)1/3. yields (6.59) The initial biomass, M0, is usually very small compared to M, and therefore Mvaries with t3. This behavior has been supported by experimental data. 6.3.3. Models for T ransient Behavior In most practical applications of microbial cultures, the environmental or culture condi- tions can shift, dramatically leading to changes in cellular composition and biosyntheticcapabilities. These cellular changes are not instantaneous but occur over an observable pe-riod of time. In this section we examine models that can describe or predict such time-dependent (or transient) changes. 6.3.3.1. Models with time delays. The unstructured growth models we have described so far are limited to balanced or pseudobalanced growth conditions. These un-structured models can be improved for use in dynamic situations through the addition oftime delays. The use of time delays incorporates structure implicitly. It is built on thepremise that the dynamic response of a cell is dominated by an internal process with atime delay on the order of the response time under observation. Other PM Page 183Figure 6.13. Comparison of from a model derived from a system-analysis per- spective, predictions from a Monod model, and experiment. The experimental system was achemostat for a glucose-limited culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae operating at a dilution rate of 0.20 h-1.

Bioeng. 15 :377, 1973, and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.)are assumed to be too fast (essentially always at a pseudoequilibrium) or too slow to influ- ence greatly the observed response. By using black-box techniques equivalent to the tradi-tional approach to the control of chemical processes, it is possible to generate transferfunctions that can represent the dynamic response of a culture. An example of the resultsfrom such an approach are given in Fig. 6.13. However, it should be recognized that suchapproaches are limited to cultures with similar growth histories and subjected to qualita-tively similar perturbations. 6.3.3.2. Chemically structured models. A much more general approach with much greater a priori predictive power is a model capturing the important kinetic in-teractions among cellular subcomponents. Initially, chemically structured models werebased on two components, but at least three components appear necessary to give good re-sults. More sophisticated models with 20 to 40 components are being used in many labo-ratories. A schematic of one such model is given in Fig. 6.14. Writing such models requires that the modeler understand the physical system at a level of greater detail than that at which the model is written, so that the appropriate as-sumptions can be made. A detailed discussion of such models is appropriate for more ad-vanced texts. However, two important guidelines in writing such models should beunderstood by even the beginning student. The first is that all reactions should be ex-pressed in terms of intrinsic concentrations. An intrinsic concentration is the amount of a compound per unit cell mass or cell volume. Extrinsic concentrations, the amount of a compound per unit reactor volume, cannot be used in kinetic expressions. Although thismay seem self-evident, all the early structured models were flawed by the use of extrinsic 184 How Cells Grow Chap. 6ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 184concentrations. A second consideration, closely related to the first, is that the dilution of intrinsic concentration by growth must be considered. The appropriate equation to use in a nonflow reactor is where VRis the total volume in the reactor, Xis the extrinsic biomass concentration, and Ciis the extrinsic concentration of component i.

(6.60) Sec. 6.3 185ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 185Equation 6.60 can also be rewritten in terms of intrinsic concentrations. For simplic- ity we will use mass fractions (e.g., Ci/X). Note that (6.61) Recalling (6.2a) we have (6.62) and, eq. constant, (6.63) In eq. 6.63, the rfiterm must be in terms of intrinsic concentrations and the term mnetCi/X represents dilution by growth. These concepts are illustrated in Example 6.3. The model indicated in Fig. 6.14 is that for a single cell. The single-cell model re- sponse can be directly related to culture response if all cells are assumed to behave identi-cally. In this case each cell has the same division cycle. A population will have, at steadystate, twice as many cells at \"birth\" as at division. The average concentrations in the cul-ture will be at the geometric mean (a time equal to multiplied by the division time) foreach cell component. Used in this way, the model is a structured, nonsegregated model. If,however, a cellular population is divided into subpopulations, with each subpopulationrepresented by a separate single-cell model, then a population model containing ahigh level of structure, as well as aspects of segregation, can be built. Such a finite-representation technique has been used and is capable of making good a priori predictionsof dynamic response in cultures (see Fig. 6.15). When used in this context, at least onerandom element in the cell cycle must be included to lead to realistic prediction of distrib-utions. Some examples of such randomness include placement of the cell cross wall, tim-ing of the initiation of chromosome synthesis or cross-wall synthesis, and distribution ofplasmids at division. With this section, the reader should have a good overview of the basic concepts in modeling and some simple tools to describe microbial growth. We need these tools to ade-quately discuss the cultivation of cells in continuous culture. Example 6.3 illustrates howa structured model might be developed. Example 6.3. Write the equations describing the following system. An organism consists of active biomass and a storage component. The storage component is made when the internal concentration ofthe carbon-energy sources is high and is degraded when it is low. Use the symbols A=active biomass, P=polymeric storage compound, S* =external concentration of S, and S=internal concentration of S. Assume that Sis the growth-rate-limiting nutrient.2dC X dtrC Xi fii 5:19 PM Page 186Solution When measuring the concentration of A, P , and S*,the natural units are grams per liter of reactor volume.

By considering S* and S separately, transients in Scan be captured. However, these transients will be fast in compari- son to changes in Aand P.The Monod and other unstructured models assume an instanta- neous equilibrium between S*and S. A number of kinetic descriptions would be defensible. However, let us assume the fol- lowing pseudochemical equations: A+ a1S+ \u00c6 2A+ (b) where Sis consumed to make 1 g of Aplus by-products; the reaction requires both A as a \"catalyst\" and Sfor building blocks.

Quantifying Growth Kinetics 187ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 187The actual reaction mechanisms implied in these reactions are likely very complex. Most reactions in a cell are saturable and subject to feedback control. For these reactions, theintracellular level of Sis the main control variable. Thus, a reasonable set of equations based on eq. 6.60 for constant V Ris (d) where k1is rate of uptake per unit cell mass (g Stransported/g X-h) and KXS*is the saturation parameter for uptake. Since S* is not a cellular component, extrinsic concentrations can be used in the rate expression. For Swe write where k2is g P(h-1). The parameters a1and a2are defined in eqs. (b) and (c), while KAS, KPSf,and KPSdare saturation parameters in units of mass fraction. Similarly, (f) where k5is a first-order coefficient (h-1) and (g) Equations f and g describe the rate of formation of Aand P. The value of k1could be determined by the uptake of a nonmetabolizable analog of the substrate, use of vesicles, or material balance information on exponentially growing cells.Values of k 2and k3can be estimated from measurements on total biomass and polymer under conditions where S/Xshould be large (e.g., exponential growth), while k4and k5can be esti- mated from time-dependent measurements of cell composition in the stationary phase, whereS/Xshould be low. If experimental values of S/Xare available at various times, then more re- fined estimates of k 2, k3, k4, and k5can be made, as well as estimates of the saturation parame- ters.

The rate forms used here are by no means the only correct solution. A more extensive base of experimental observations would be needed to eliminate other possible formulations. 6.3.4. Cybernetic Models Another modeling approach has been developed primarily to predict growth under condi- tions when several substrates are available. These substrates may be complementary (e.g.,carbon or nitrogen) or substitutable. For example, glucose and lactose would be substi-tutable, as these compounds both supply carbon and energy. As the reader will recall, wediscussed the diauxic phenomenon for sequential use of glucose and lactose in Chapter 4.That experimental observation led us to an understanding of regulation of the lacoperon and catabolite repression. This metabolic regulation was necessary for the transition fromone primary pathway to another. The reader might infer that the culture had as its objec-tive function the maximization of its growth rate. One approach to modeling growth on multiple substrates is a cybernetic approach. Cybernetic means that a process is goal seeking (e.g., maximization of growth rate).While this approach was initially motivated by a desire to predict the response of a micro-bial culture to growth on a set of substitutable carbon sources, it has been expanded toprovide an alternative method of identifying the regulatory structure of a complex bio-chemical reaction network (such as cellular metabolism) in a simple manner. Typically asingle objective, such as maximum growth rate, is chosen and an objective-oriented math-ematical analysis is employed. This analysis is similiar to many economic analyses for re-source distribution. For many practical situations this approach describes satisfactorilygrowth of a culture on a complex medium. However, the potential power of this approachis now being realized in efforts in metabolic engineering and in relating information onDNA sequences in an organism to physiologic function (see Chapter 8). This approach has limitations, as the objective function for any organism is maxi- mizing its long-term survival as a species. Maximization of growth rate or of growth yieldare really subobjectives which can dominate under some environmental conditions; theseconditions are often of great interest to the bioprocess engineer. Consequently, the cyber-netic approach is often a valuable tool. It is too complex for us to describe in detail in thisbook; the interested reader may consult the references at the end of this chapter. 6.4. HOW CELLS GROW IN CONTINUOUS CULTURE 6.4.1. IntroductionThe culture environment changes continually in a batch culture. Growth, product forma- tion, and substrate utilization terminate after a certain time interval, whereas, in continu-ous culture, fresh nutrient medium is continually supplied to a well-stirred culture, andproducts and cells are simultaneously withdrawn. Growth and product formation can bemaintained for prolonged periods in continuous culture. After a certain period of time, the Sec. 6.3 Quantifying Growth Kinetics 189ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 189system usually reaches a steady state where cell, product, and substrate concentrations remain constant. Continuous culture provides constant environmental conditions forgrowth and product formation and supplies uniform-quality product. Continuous cultureis an important tool to determine the response of microorganisms to their environment andto produce the desired products under optimal environmental conditions. In Chapter 9we will compare batch and continuous culture in terms of their suitability for large-scaleoperation. 6.4.2. Some Specific Devices for Continuous CultureThe primary types of continuous cultivation devices are the chemostat and turbidostat , al- though plug flow reactors (PFR) are used. In some cases these units are modified by recy-cle of cells. Figure 6.16 is a schematic of a continuous culture device (chemostat). Cellular growth is usually limited by one essential nutrient, and other nutrients are in excess. As we willshow, when a chemostat is at steady state, the nutrient, product, and cell concentrations areconstant. For this reason, the name chemostat refers to constant chemical environment. Figure 6.17 is a schematic of a turbidostat in which the cell concentration in the cul- ture vessel is maintained constant by monitoring the optical density of the culture andcontrolling the feed flow rate. When the turbidity of the medium exceeds the set point, a Figure 6.16. A continuous-culture laboratory setup (chemostat). (With permission, from D. I. C. Wang and others, Fermentation and Enzyme Technology , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1979, p. 99.) 190 How Cells Grow Chap. 6ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 190pump is activated and fresh medium is added. The culture volume is kept constant by re- moving an equal amount of culture fluid. The turbidostat is less used than the chemostat,since it is more elaborate than a chemostat and because the environment is dynamic. Tur-bidostats can be very useful in selecting subpopulations able to withstand a desiredenvironmental stress (for example, high ethanol concentrations), because the cell concen-tration is maintained constant. The selection of variants or mutants with desirable proper-ties is very important (see Chapter 8). A plug flow reactor (PFR) can also be used for continuous cultivation purposes. Since there is no backmixing in an ideal PFR, fluid elements containing active cells can-not inoculate other fluid elements at different axial positions. Liquid recycle is requiredfor continuous inoculation of nutrient media. In a PFR, substrate and cell concentrationsvary with axial position in the vessel. An ideal PFR resembles a batch reactor in whichdistance along the fermenter replaces incubation time in a batch reactor. In waste treat-ment, some units approach PFR behavior, and multistage chemostats tend to approachPFR dynamics if the number of stages is large (five or more). 6.4.3. The Ideal Chemostat An ideal chemostat is the same as a perfectly mixed continuous-flow, stirred-tank reactor (CFSTR). Most chemostats require some control elements, such as pH and dissolved-oxygen control units, to be useful. Fresh sterile medium is fed to the completely mixedand aerated (if required) reactor, and cell suspension is removed at the same rate. Liquidvolume in the reactor is kept constant. Figure 6.18 is a schematic of a simplified chemostat. A material balance on the cell concentration around the chemostat yields (6.64) FX FX V X V k X VdX dtRR d R 0 -+ - = mg Figure 6.17.

The reader should note that if cell mass is the pri- mary parameter, it is difficult to differentiate cell death from endogenous metabolism.When we use k d, we imply that endogenous metabolism is the primary mechanism for cell mass decrease. With k\u00a2d, we imply that cell death and lysis are the primary mechanisms of decrease in mass. The reader should also note that, if eq. 6.64 had been written in terms ofcell number, k dcould only be a cell death rate. When balances are written in terms of cell number, the influence of endogenous metabolism can appear only in the substrate balanceequation. Since most experiments are done by measuring total cell mass rather than num-ber, we write our examples based on X. However, the reader should be aware of the ambi- guity introduced when equations are written in terms of X. Equation 6.64 can be rearranged as (6.65) where Dis dilution rate and D =F/V R. Dis the reciprocal of residence time. Usually, the feed media are sterile, X0=0, and if the endogenous metabolism or death rate is negligible compared to the growth rate ( kd<< mg) and if the system is at steady state ( dX/dt =0), then mg=D(if kd=0) (6.66) In a chemostat, cells are removed at a rate equal to their growth rate, and the growth rate of cells is equal to the dilution rate. This property allows the investigator to manipulate growth rate as an independent parameter and makes the chemostat a powerful experimen- tal tool.dX dtDX k D Xd - -0()mg Figure 6.18.

The use of the superscript Mon YX/Sdenotes a maximum value of the yield coefficient; such a superscript will be important in discussing the effects ofmaintenance energy. When extracellular product formation is negligible and the system is at steady state (dS/dt =0), (6.70) Since m g=Dat steady state if kd=0, (6.71) Using eq. 6.68, the steady-state cell concentration expressed as eqs. 6.71 and 6.72, the yield coefficient ( YX/S) is assumed to be constant, which is an approximation, since endogenous metabolism has been neglected. Usually, YX/Svaries with the limiting nutrient and growth rate. Consider the effect the inclusion of endogenousmetabolism will have; Ds m=- mmm g==+DS KSm s Sec. 6.4 How Cells Grow in Continuous Culture 193ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 193By substituting eq. 6.73b into the steady-state substrate balance, assuming no extracellu- lar product formation (eq. 6.70), we find (6.73c) where YM X/Sdenotes the maximum or mainte- nance energy). YM X/Shas a single constant value independent of growth rate. This approach does not allow the direct conversion of Sinto maintenance energy. Rather, Smust be first incorporated into the cell mass, where it is degraded by endogenous metabolism. Thisviewpoint is the proper one when working with an unstructured model. With a structuredmodel, which explicitly recognizes intracellular Sas a subcomponent of the biomass, the direct consumption of Sfor maintenance functions could be modeled. However, with un- structured models, substrate that is no longer extracellular becomes part of the biomass. Equation 6.73c can be rearranged to (6.74) or (6.75a) (6.75b) (6.76) where (6.77) where m sis the maintenance coefficient based on substrate S. YAP X/Sis the apparent yield. When YX/Sis written, it should be interpreted as YAP X/S. While YM X/Sis a constant, YAP if Values of YM X/Sand mscan be obtained from chemostat experiments by plotting 1/YAP X/Sagainst 1/ D. The slope msand the intercept is 1/ YM X/S(see Fig. mnet =mmS/(Ks+S) -kd), we can also show that (6.78) and (6.79) In addition to the effects of maintenance, it is often appropriate to consider the conversion of extracellular substrate into extracellular product. With an unstructuredXY S k XXSM d () / ( )/ 0 10 -- + = 194 How Cells Grow Chap. 6ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 194model, we must view this conversion as instantaneous. Otherwise, a perceptible period of substrate uptake, prior to conversion to product, would cause a change in the amount of X. This is unlike maintenance, since the period between substrate uptake and use for mainte-nance functions may be long, so we allow Sto become incorporated into Xand Xis then degraded when needed; the following equations assume instantaneous conversion of sub-strate to extracellular product, with the cell acting as a catalyst. The balance on productformation is DP =q PX (6.80) where nongrowth-associated product for- mation, qPis a constant ( b), while for growth-associated products it is a function of mg. For substrate balance, eq. 6.69 becomes (6.81) The biomass balance is unchanged from the case with endogenous metabolism estimating YM X/Sand msfor chemostat data for E. coli growing on glucose as the limiting nutrient. Sec. 6.4 How Cells Grow in Continuous Culture 195ch06 10/11/01 5:19 PM Page 195(6.78) Equation 6.81 can be solved for X: (6.82) The productivity of a chemostat for product and biomass (Prx) can be found from DPand DX, respectively. The dilution rate that maximizes productivity is found by differentiating DPor DXwith respect to Dand setting the derivative equal to zero. The optimal value of D(Dopt) will depend on whether endogenous metabolism and/or product formation are considered. When kd=0 and qP=0, eqs. 6.71 and 6.68 ( DX) becomes (6.83) Since S0is usually much greater than Ks, Doptwill approach D =mmor the washout point. Stable chemostat operation with D \u00aammis very difficult, unless the flow rate and liquid volume can be maintained exactly constant. Consequently, a value of Dslightly less than Doptmay be a good compromise between stability and biomass productivity. It should also be apparent that Doptfor biomass formation will not necessarily be optimal for product formation. Examples 6.4 and 6.5 illustrate the use of these equations to characterize the perfor- mance of chemostats. Example 6.4. A new strain of yeast is being considered for biomass production.

The Chemostat as a T ool The chemostat can be used as a tool to study the mutation and selection of cultures and also to study the effect of changes in the environment on cell physiology. The molecularaspects of mutation and selection will be discussed in Chapter 8. Natural or induced mutations can take place in a chemostat culture. Errors in DNA replication take place with an average frequency of about 10 -6to 10-8gene per generation. With a cell concentration of 109cells/ml in culture, the probability is high in a chemostat that a wide variety of mutant cells will be formed. The vast majority of natural mutationsin a chemostat are of little significance, unless the mutation alters the function of a proteininvolved in growth in the chemostat environment. If the specific growth rate of the mutantis larger than that of the wild type, then the mutant outgrows the wild type in a chemostat.This selection for a variant cell type can be accomplished by creating a more favorable en-vironment for growth of the mutant organism. A chemostat culture can be used for the selection of special organisms. Selection or enrichment nutrient media need to be used for this purpose. For example, if it is desired toselect an organism growing on ethanol, a nutrient medium containing ethanol and mineralsalts is used as a feed to a chemostat culture. An organism capable of oxidizing sometoxic refractory compounds can be selected from a mixed culture by slowly feeding thiscompound to a chemostat. A thermophilic organism can be selected from a natural popu-lation by operating a chemostat at an elevated temperature (e.g., 50 to 60 C). Selection in chemostats also presents significant problems in the culture of cells containing recombi-nant DNA. The most productive cells often grow more slowly and are displaced by lessproductive cells. We will discuss this problem in more detail in Chapter 14. 6.4.5. Deviations from Ideality In fermentations such as the utilization or production of polysaccharides or mycelial fer- mentations, the fermentation broth may be highly viscous and it may be difficult to main-tain complete mixing. Also, certain cells tend to grow in the form of a film on solidsurfaces in fermenters, such as on fermenter walls or probe surfaces. Incomplete mixing isthe rule in industrial-scale fermenters. The presence of incompletely mixed regions in a\"chemostat\" culture is common. The term \"chemostat\" is actually applicable only toperfectly mixed vessels. Here we denote nonideality by putting chemostat in quota-tion marks. A segregated reactor model can be used to analyze an incompletely mixedcontinuous-flow fermenter. A simple, two-compartmental model of a \"chemostat\" culture is depicted in Fig. 6.20, where the reactor is divided into two regions: a well-mixed region and a stag-nant region. Feed and effluent streams pass through the well-mixed region 1, and mass ex-change takes place between the two regions. The biomass and substrate balances for bothregions at steady state are as follows:Pr ( ) . ./ xX SDX = --\u00ca \u00cb \u00af0 01 198In an with a stagnant biotic phase, dilution rate can exceed mmwithout washout. The washout dilution rate is obtained by setting S0=S1=S2 and is where Dwois the washout dilution rate. 6.5. SUMMARY During batch cultivation, a population of cells typically exhibits several different growth phases. During the lag phase, the cell builds the biosynthetic pathways necessary for max-imal growth rates in the fresh medium. During exponential growth , cell replication is maximal, and the chemical composition of the cell population is nearly constant (e.g., bal-anced growth). When substrate is nearly exhausted or when toxic metabolic by-productshave built to a critical level, the growth rate begins to drop rapidly, causing significantchanges in biosynthetic pathways. In the stationary phase , there is no net growth; cells now reorient their metabolic machinery to increase the probability of long-term survival.At some point, some cells can no longer obtain enough energy from their reserves orenough of another critical resource, and the culture enters the death phase . Dead cells do not have an energized membrane and often lyse (or break apart). Nutrients released bylysed cells can be utilized by survivors, allowing cryptic growth. Products formed by cells can be related to this batch-culture growth cycle. Primary products are growth associated. Secondary products are nongrowth associated and aremade in the stationary phase. Some products have both growth-associated and nongrowth-associated components. Cell-growth kinetics can be modeled. Models that are structured break the popula- tion into distinct subcomponents. Unstructured models quantify cell m am0 02 0 001 11() () Substrate balance Biomass balance Region 1 X1=Y(S0-S1) Region Figure 6.20.

Unstructured models cannot describe transient behavior very well. Some models are segregated ; they recognize that not all members of the population are identi- cal, and the distribution of properties among individual cells is important. Nonsegregated models ignore these distributions and assume that population-average parameters are adequate. These models apply not only to batch culture but also to continuous culture. The primary form of continuous culture is a steady-state CFSTR or chemostat . A chemostat ensures a time-invariant growth environment. The net growth rate is equal to the dilutionrate, which is determined by the flow rate to the chemostat. Thus, the growth rate can bemanipulated by the investigator. A turbidostat adjusts flow rate to maintain a constant cell density. A turbidostat operates well at high flow rates (near the washout point) and is use-ful in selecting cellular subpopulations that have adapted to a particular stress.

INTRODUCTION Cell growth and product formation are complex processes reflecting the overall kinetics and stoichiometry of the thousands of intracellular reactions that can be observed within a cell.For many process calculations, we wish to compare potential substrates in terms of cell massyield, or product yield, or evolution of heat. Also, we may need to know how close to its ther-modynamic limit a system is operating. (That is, is product yield constrained by kinetic orthermodynamic considerations?) If a system is close to its thermodynamic limit, it would beunwise to try to improve production through mutation or genetic engineering. Although the cell is complex, the stoichiometry of conversion of substrates into products and cellular materials is often represented by a simple pseudochemical equation.In this chapter we will discuss how these equations can be written and how useful esti-mates of key yield coefficients can be made. 7 .2. SOME OTHER DEFINITIONS In Chapter 6 we discussed the definitions of yield and maintenance coefficients, and we learned how to estimate their values using chemostat culture. In particular, we discussedthe overall growth yield coefficient Y M X/S, which is the maximum yield of cell mass per unit mass of substrate consumed when no maintenance is considered. 2077ch07 10/11/01 5:20 PM Page 207208 Stoichiometry of Microbial Growth Product Formation Chap. 7Two other yield and maintenance coefficients of importance are related to ATP con- sumption and oxygen. The ATP yield coefficient, YX/A TP, represents the amount of biomass synthesized per mole of ATP generated. Surprisingly, it has been observed that for manysubstrates and organisms Y M X/AT Pis nearly constant at 10 to 11 g dry weight/mol ATP for heterotrophic growth under anaerobic conditions. The ATP yield for many autotrophic or-ganisms (recall that autotrophic organisms fix CO 2) is YM X/AT P \u00aa 6.5 g/mol ATP. Under aero- bic conditions, the values for YM X/AT Pare usually greater than 10.5 (see Table 7.1). Table 7.2 shows calculated ATP yields (maximum theoretical values) for a variety of media. Amaintenance coefficient can also be estimated using an equation analogous to the one wedeveloped for substrate yield coefficient in a chemostat: (7.1) where Y AP X/AT Pis the \"apparent\" yield of biomass and mAT Pis the rate of ATP consumption for maintenance energy. Similarly, yields based on oxygen consumption can be defined and calculated.

TABLE 7 .2 ATP Yields in Various Growth Media Growth Medium YX/A TP(g cells/mol ATP) Glucose indicated in Table 6.1, values of YX/O2can vary from 0.17 to 1.5 g biomass/g O2, depending on substrate and organism. Information from some measurements can be usefully combined. A particularly im- portant derived parameter is the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is defined as the molesof CO 2produced per mole of oxygen consumed. The RQ value provides an indication of metabolic state (for example, aerobic growth versus ethanol fermentation in baker's yeast)and can be used in process control. We have already discussed (Chapter 5) the P/O ratio, which is the ratio of phosphate bonds formed per unit of oxygen consumed (g mole P/g atom O). The P/O ratio indicatesthe efficiency of conversion of reducing power into high-energy phosphate bonds in therespiratory chain. For eucaryotes, the P/O ratio approaches 3 when glucose is the sub-strate, while it is significantly less in procaryotes. A closely related parameter is the pro-ton/oxygen ratio (H/O). This ratio is the number of H +ions released per unit of oxygen consumed. Electron generation is directly related to proton release. Usually 4 mol of elec-trons are consumed per mole of oxygen consumed. The generation of electrons results inthe expulsion of H +that can be used directly to drive the transport of some substrates or to generate ATP. The complexity of mass and energy balances for cellular growth can be decreased greatly through the recognition that some parameters are nearly the same irrespective ofthe species or substrate involved. These parameters can be referred to as regularities . For example, we have shown in Table 7.1 that Y M X/A TP 10.5 g dry wt/mol ATP. Three impor- tant regularities (identified first by I. G. Minkevich and V . K. Eroshin) are 26.95 kcal/gequivalent of available electrons transferred to oxygen (coefficient of variation of 4%),4.291 g equivalent of available electrons per quantity of biomass containing 1 g atom car-bon, and 0.462 g carbon in biomass per gram of dry biomass. It has also been observedthat Y X/e -=3.14 \u00b10.11 g dry wt/g equivalent of electrons. These observed average values of cell composition and yields facilitate estimates of other growth-related parameters. 7 .3. STOICHIOMETRIC CALCULATIONS 7 .3.1. Elemental BalancesA material balance on biological reactions can easily be written when the compositions of substrates, products, and cellular material are known. Usually, electron-proton balancesare required in addition to elemental balances to determine the stoichiometric coefficientsin bioreactions. Accurate determination of the composition of cellular material is a majorproblem. Variations in cellular composition with different types of organisms are shown inTable 7.3. A typical cellular composition can be represented as CH 1.8O0.5N0.2. One mole of biological material is defined as the amount containing 1 gram atom of carbon, such asCH aObNd.

Simple elemental balances on C, H, O, and N yield the following equations: (7.4) The respiratory quotient (RQ) is (7.5) Equations 7.4 and 7.5 constitute five equations for five unknowns a, b,c,d, and e.With a measured value of RQ, these equations can be solved to determine the stoichiometriccoefficients. 7 .3.2. Degree of Reduction In more complex reactions, as in the formation of extracellular products, an additional sto- ichiometric coefficient is added, requiring more information. Also, elemental balancesprovide no insight into the energetics of a reaction. Consequently, the concept of degree of reduction has been developed and used for proton-electron balances in bioreactions. The degree of reduction, g, for organic compounds may be defined as the number of equiva- lents of available electrons per gram atom C. The available electrons are those that wouldbe transferred to oxygen upon oxidation of a compound to CO 2, H2O, and NH3. The de- grees of reduction for some key elements are C =4, H =1, N =-3, O =-2, P =5, and S =6. The degree of reduction of any element in a compound is equal to the valence of this element. For example, 4 is the valence of carbon in CO2and -3 is the valence of N in NH3. Degrees of reduction for various organic compounds are given in Table 7.4. The fol- lowing are examples of how to calculate the degree of reduction for substrates. degree of reduction indicates a low degree of oxidation. That is, gCH4>gEtOH >gglucose . Consider the aerobic production of a single extracellular product.

Equation 7.6 can lead to elemental balances on C, H, O, and N, an available electron balance, an energy balance, and a total mass balance. Of the equations, only five will beindependent. If all the equations are written, then the extra equations can be used to checkthe consistency of an experimental data set. Because the amount of water formed or usedin such reactions is difficult to determine and water is present in great excess, the hydro-gen and oxygen balances are difficult to use. For such a data set, we would typicallychoose a carbon, a nitrogen, and an available-electron balance. Thus, (7.10) (7.11) (7.12) With partial experimental data, it is possible to solve this set of equations.

However, the oxygen yield on glucose is higher than that on the hexade-cane, since glucose is partially oxidized. 7 .4. THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS OF YIELD COEFFICIENTS In aerobic fermentations, the growth yield per available electron in oxygen molecules is approximately 3.14 \u00b10.11 gdw cells/electron when ammonia is used as the nitrogen source. The number of available electrons per oxygen molecule (O2) is four. When the number of oxygen molecules per mole of substrate consumed is known, the growth yieldcoefficient, Y X/S, can easily be calculated. Consider the aerobic catabolism of glucose. C6H12O6+6 O2 \u00e6\u00c6 6 CO2+6 number of available electrons in 1 mole of glucose is 24. The cellular yield per available electron is YX/S =24(3.14) =76 gdw gdw cells/g glucose.

The product yields are about 90% to 95% of the maximal values, because the glucose is converted into biomass and other metabolic by-products (e.g., glycerol or acetate). 7 .5. SUMMARY Simple methods to determine the reaction stoichiometry for bioreactors are reviewed. These methods lead to the possibility of predicting yield coefficients for various fermentationsusing a variety of substrates. By coupling these equations to experimentally measurable pa-rameters, such as the respiratory quotient, we can infer a great deal about the progress of afermentation. Such calculations can also assist in initial process design equations by allow-ing the prediction of the amount of oxygen required (and consequently heat generated) for acertain conversion of a particular substrate. The prediction of yield coefficients is not exact,because unknown or unaccounted for metabolic pathways and products are present.Nonetheless, such calculations provide useful first estimates of such parameters.

INTRODUCTION We have already discussed some aspects of how cells inherit information and how a chemostat (Chapter 6) can be used as a tool to select for individual cells with different oraugmented metabolism. The mechanism for DNA replication in procaryotes has beensummarized in Chapter 4. This process is a good example of the exchange of genetic in-formation from one generation to another. However, some individuals can receive ad-ditional genetic information through natural or artificial means. The initial geneticinformation within a cell may also undergo rearrangements or alterations. In this chapterwe will discuss some mechanisms causing alterations in a cell's content of genetic infor-mation and ways that we can manipulate those mechanisms to improve bioprocesses. 8.2. EVOLVING DESIRABLE BIOCHEMICAL ACTIVITIES THROUGH MUTATION AND SELECTION Although the cell has a well-developed system to prevent errors in DNA replication and an active repair system to correct damage to a DNA molecule, mistakes occur. These mis-takes are called mutations . Before we discuss mutations, we need to establish the working vocabulary of microbial genetics.8 How Cellular Information Is Alteredch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 219The sum of the genetic construction of an organism constitutes its genotype . The characteristics expressed by a cell constitute its phenotype . The phenotypic response of a culture may change reversibly with alterations in environmental conditions, whereas thegenotype is constant irrespective of the environment. A mutation is a genotypic change and is irreversible. A whole culture undergoes a phenotypic response, whereas only a rareindividual will undergo a genotypic change. For example, if a culture changes in colorfrom white to green when oxygen levels fall and then changes from green to white uponan increase in dissolved oxygen, the change would be phenotypic. Now consider an alter-native experiment where white cells were removed from a culture and placed on a plate (a small circular dish filled with nutrients solidified with agar) and allowed to grow intoseparate colonies. If one colony, but not the others, turned green and if cells obtained fromthe green colony remain green when cultured under the original conditions, it would beevidence for a genotypic change. In this case, the white cells would be the wild type and the green cells the mutants . Let us consider what mechanisms may lead to genotypic change. 8.2.1. How Mutations Occur Most mutations occur due to mistakes in DNA synthesis. Some examples are shown in Fig. 8.1. One common form is a point mutation . A point mutation results from the change of a single base (for example, cytosine instead of thymine). Some point mutations aresilent mutations because the altered codon still codes for the same amino acid (e.g., UCU and UCA both code for serine). Even if the point mutation causes the substitution of adifferent amino acid, it may or may not alter protein activity substantially. A change ofamino acid near the active site might alter protein activity greatly, whereas the samesubstitution at another site might not be very critical. One type of point mutation that usually has a profound effect results in a nonsense or stop codon (e.g., CAA for glutamine to UAA for stop on the m-RNA from the altered DNA). This results in the premature termination of translation and an incompletelyformed protein. Generally, deletion mutations have profound effects on cellular metabolism. By deleting or adding one or more bases, we can alter the whole composition of a protein, notjust a single amino acid. A deletion can shift the reading frame when translating the re- sulting m-RNA. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.2. Additions often take place through insertion elements (IS). These elements are about 700 to 1400 base pairs in length; in E. coli about five different IS sequences are known and are present on the chromosome. These elements can move on the chromosomefrom essentially any one site to another. Often they will insert in the middle of a gene, to-tally destroying its function. Back mutations or reversions are possible. Revertants are cells for which the origi- nal wild-type phenotype has been restored. Restoration of a function can occur due to adirect change at the original mutation (e.g., if the original mutation was CAA to UAA,then a second mutation for UAA to CAA restores the original genotype and phenotype).Second-site revertants can occur that restore phenotype ( suppressor mutations ), but not genotype (e.g., a second deletion mutation that restores the gene to the normal readingframe or a mutation in another gene that restores the wild-type phenotype). 220 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8ch08 5:23 PM Page 2208.2.2. Selecting for Desirable Mutants Mutants can serve as powerful tools to better understand cell physiology; they are also valuable as industrial organisms, because mutation can be used to alter metabolic regula-tion and to cause overproduction of a desired compound. Methods to induce mutationsand then select for mutants are important tools for catalyst development in bioprocessing. Natural ( spontaneous ) rates of mutation vary greatly from gene to gene (10 -3to 10-9 per cell division), with 10-6mutations in a gene per cell division being typical. Chemical agents ( mutagens ) or radiation are often used in the laboratory to increase mutation rates. Mutagens are nonspecific and may affect any gene. Sec. 8.2 Evolving Desirable Biochemical Activities 221 Figure 8.1. DNA base changes from wild type, involving point mutation and deletion.(With permission, from T. D. Brock, D. W.Smith, and M. T. Madigan, Biology of Mi- croorganisms , 4th ed., Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1984, p. 307.)ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 221The selection of a mutant with desirable properties is no easy task. Mutations are classified as selectable and unselectable . A selectable mutation confers upon the mutant an advantage for growth or survival under a specific set of environmental conditions; thus,the mutant can grow and the wild type will die. An unselectable mutant requires a cell-by-cell examination to find a mutant with the desired characteristics (e.g., green pigment).Even with mutagens, the frequency of mutation is sufficiently low to make prohibitive abrute-force screening effort for most unselectable mutants. Selection can be direct or indirect. An example of direct selection would be to find a mutant resistant to an antibiotic or toxic compound. A culture fluid containing 10 8to 1010 cells/ml is subjected to a mutagenic agent. A few drops of culture fluid are spread evenlyon a plate, with the antibiotic incorporated into the gelled medium. Only antibiotic-resistant cells can grow, so any colonies that form must arise from antibiotic-resistant mu-tants. If one in a million cells has this particular mutation, we would expect to find about10 to 100 colonies per plate if 0.1 ml of culture fluid was tested. Indirect selection is used for isolating mutants that are deficient in their capacity to produce a necessary growth factor (e.g., an amino acid or a vitamin). Wild-type E. coli grow on glucose and mineral salts. Auxotrophic mutants would not grow on such a simple medium unless it were supplemented with the growth factor that the cell could no longer make (e.g.,a lysine auxotroph has lost the capacity to make lysine, so lysine must be added to the glu-cose and salts to enable the cell to grow). The wild-type cell that needs no supplements to aminimal medium is called a prototroph . Consider the selection of a rare mutant cell that is auxotrophic for lysine from a population of wild-type cells. This cannot be done directly,since both cell types would grow in the minimal medium supplemented with lysine. Amethod that facilitates selection greatly is called replicate plating (see Fig. 8.3). A master plate using lysine-supplemented medium will grow both the auxotroph and wild-type cells.Once colonies are well formed on the master plate, an imprint is made on sterile velveteen.The bristles on the velveteen capture some of the cells from each colony. The orientationof the master plate is carefully noted. Then a test plate with minimal medium is pressedagainst the velveteen; some cells, at the point of each previous colony, then serve to inoculate 222 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8 Figure 8.2.

After incubation (approxi- mately 24 hours for E. coli ), the test plate is compared to the master plate. Colonies that ap- pear at the same positions on both plates arise from wild-type cells, while colonies that existonly on the master plate must arise from the auxotrophic mutants. Another class of mutants is called conditional mutants. Mutations that would nor- mally be lethal to the cell could not be detected by methods we have described so far.However, mutated proteins are often more temperature sensitive than normal proteins.Thus, temperature sensitivity can often be used to select for conditionally lethal muta-tions. For example, the mutant may be unable to grow at the normal growth temperature(e.g., 37\u00b0C for E. coli ) but will grow satisfactorily at a lower temperature (e.g., 25\u00b0C). Table 8.1 summarizes a variety of mutants and how they may be detected. Mutation and selection have been used to tremendous advantage to probe the basic features of cell physiology and regulation. They also have been the mainstay of industrialprograms for the improvement of production strains. Mutation and selection programshave been primarily responsible for increasing the yield of penicillin from 0.001 g/l in1939 to current values of about 50 g/l of fermentation broth. 8.3. NATURAL MECHANISMS FOR GENE TRANSFER AND REARRANGEMENT Bacteria can gain and express wholely different biochemical capabilities (e.g., the ability to degrade an antibiotic or detoxify a hazardous chemical in their environment) literallyovernight. These alterations cannot be explained through inheritance and small evolution-ary changes in the chromosome. Rather, they arise from gene transfer from one organismto another and/or large rearrangements in chromosomal DNA. In this section we will dis-cuss genetic recombination, gene transfer, and genetic rearrangements\u2014all mechanismsthat can be exploited to genetically engineer cells. (See Table 8.1.) 8.3.1. Genetic RecombinationGenetic recombination is a process that brings genetic elements from two different genomes into one unit, resulting in new genotypes in the absence of mutations. Geneticrecombination in procaryotes is a rare event, but sufficiently frequent to be important in-dustrially and ecologically. The three main mechanisms for gene transfer are transforma- tion, transduction, and conjugation . Transformation is a process in which free DNA is taken up by a cell. Transduction is a process in which DNA is transferred by a bacterio-phage, and conjugation is DNA transfer between intact cells that are in direct contact withone another. Once donor DNA is inside a cell, the mechanism for recombination is essentially in- dependent of how the donor DNA was inserted. Figure 8.4 summarizes the molecular-level events in general recombination. The donor DNA must be homologous, or nearly so,to a segment of DNA on the recipient DNA. Under the right conditions, cellular enzymes Sec. 8.3 Natural Mechanisms for Gene Transfer and Rearrangement 225Illegitimate recombination between nonhomologous regions of DNA is possible, but rare. See later dis- cussion on transposons.ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 225cut out the homologous section of recipient DNA, allow insertion of the donor DNA, and then ligate or join the ends of the donor DNA to the recipient DNA. Pieces of donor DNAthat a cell recognizes as foreign are usually degraded by enzymes called restriction en- donucleases (these enzymes are essential in genetic engineering). A cell marks its own DNA (e.g., through methylation of certain purine or pyrimidine bases) to distinguish itfrom foreign DNA. These modifications block the action of a cell's own restriction en-donucleases on its own DNA. Under natural conditions, gene transfer is effective only ifthe donor DNA is from the same or closely related species. Let us now consider some details of how donor DNA can enter a cell. 226 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8 Figure 8.4. Integration of transforming DNA into a recipient cell.

T ransformation The uptake of naked DNA cannot be done by all genera of bacteria. Even within trans- formable genera, only certain strains are transformable ( competent ). Competent cells have a much higher capacity for binding DNA to the cell surface than do noncompetent cells.Competency can depend on the physiological state of the cell (current and previousgrowth conditions). Even in a competent population not all cells are transformable. Typi-cally, about 0.1% to 1.0% are transformable. E. coli are not normally competent, but their importance to microbial genetics has led to the development of empirical procedures to induce competency. This procedure in-volves treating E. coli with high concentrations of calcium ions, coupled with temperature manipulation. The competency of treated cells varies among strains of E. coli but is typi- cally rather low (about one in a million cells becomes successfully transformed). With theuse of selective markers, this frequency is still high enough to be quite useful. Transformation is useful only when the information that enters the cell can be prop- agated. When doing transformation, we typically use a vector called a plasmid . This ele- ment forms the basis for most industrially important fermentations with recombinantDNA. A plasmid is an autonomous, double-strand piece of DNA that isnormally extrachromosomal. Some plasmids are maintained as low-copy-number plas-mids (only a few copies per cell), and others have a high copy number (20 to 100 copiesper cell). These plasmids differ in their mechanisms for partitioning at cell division and inthe control of their replication. Plasmids encode genes typically for proteins that arenonessential for growth, but that can confer important advantages to their host cells undersome environmental circumstances. For example, most plasmids encode proteins that con-fer resistance to specific antibiotics. Such antibiotic resistance is very helpful in selectingfor cells that contain a desired plasmid. 8.3.3. T ransduction DNA transfer from one cell to another can be mediated by viruses and certainly plays an im- portant role in nature. In the most common type of transduction, generalized transduction , infection of a recipient cell results in fragmentation of the bacterial DNA into 100 or sopieces. One of these fragments can be packaged accidentally into a phage particle. The de-fective phage particle then injects bacterial DNA into another cell, where it can recombinewith that cell's DNA. With generalized transduction, any bacterial gene may be transferred. Another method of transfer, which is far more specific with respect to the genes that are transferred, is specialized transduction . Here the phage incorporates into specific sites in the chromosome, and the frequency of transduction of a gene is related to its distance away fromthe site of incorporation. This process is summarized in Fig. 8.5. A lysogenic cell is one carry- ing a prophage or phage DNA incorporated into chromosomal DNA. Phage lambda is an ex-ample of such a temperate phage (a phage that can either lyse a cell or become incorporated into the chromosome). Such phages almost invariably insert at a specific site in the chromo-some. The conversion of a prophage (the phage DNA in the chromosome) into the lytic cycle is normally a rare event (10 -4per cell division), but it can be induced in almost the whole cul- ture upon exposure to UV light or other agents that interfere with DNA replication. Sec. 8.3 Natural Mechanisms for Gene Transfer and Rearrangement 227ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 2278.3.4. Episomes and Conjugation A third type of gene transfer involves another genetic element. This element is called an episome . It is a DNA molecule that may exist either integrated into the chromosome or separate from it. When it exists separately from the chromosome (extrachromosomally), itis essentially a plasmid. A well-known episome is the F or fertility factor. Such factors areresponsible for the process known as conjugation . 228 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8 Figure 8.5. Transduction, the transfer of genetic material from donor to recipient via virus particles. (With permission, from T. D. Brock, K. M. Brock, and D. M. Ward, Basic Microbiology with Applications , 3d ed., Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1986, p. 161.)ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 228Most experiments with conjugation are done with the F factor, which is present in low copy number. Direct cell-to-cell contact is required. This DNA molecule encodes atleast 13 genes involved in its self-transfer from one cell to another. In a population of E. coli there are frequently some cells with the F plasmid, which are termed F +(male). Other cells are F-(female). F+cells encode proteins to make a sex pilus . When F+and F-cells are mixed together, the sex pilus connects an F+to an F-cell (see Fig. 8.6). The sex pilus may act as a conduit for the transfer of a copy of the F plasmid to the F-cell. The actual process of transfer involves replication of the F plasmid. This process is normal and does not involve transfer of chromosomal genes or re- combination. A more rare event is when the F plasmid has been integrated into the chro-mosome itself to form a single, large, circular molecule. Thirteen sites for integration areknown. Such cells are termed Hfr (for high-frequency recombination). When transfer is initiated, the F plasmid moves not only itself, but also the attached chromosome, to the recipient cell. The time required to transfer a whole E. coli chromo- some is 100 min. If contact between the two cells is broken during the transfer process,only a proportional amount of the chromosome will have been transferred (that is, at50 min, about 50%). Since the transfer begins at a known point, Hfr cells can be used tomap the location of genes on the chromosome. This technique for gene mapping is beingreplaced by methods for directly sequencing nucleotide sequences in DNA. If F +and F-cells differ in properties (e.g., the ability to make lysine), conjugation can be used to alter the properties of the F-cell. Conjugation, transduction, and transformation all represent forms of gene transfer from one cell to another. However, gene transfer can occur within a cell.

T ransposons: Internal Gene T ransfer Previously, we discussed the presence of insertion elements on the chromosome. A closely related phenomenon is a transposon , which refers to a gene or genes that have the ability to \"jump\" from one piece of DNA to another, or to another position on the originalpiece of DNA. The transposon integrates itself into the new position independently of anyhomology with the recipient piece of DNA. Transposons differ from insertion sequencesin that they code for proteins. Transposons appear to arise when a gene becomes boundedon both sides by insertion sequences. Many of the transposons encode antibioticresistance. Transposons are important because (1) they can induce mutations when they insert into the middle of a gene, (2) they can bring once-separate genes together, and (3) in com-bination with plasmid- or viral-mediated gene transfer, they can mediate the movement ofgenes between unrelated bacteria (e.g., multiple antibiotic resistance on newly formedplasmids). Transposon mutagensis can be a very powerful tool in altering cellular properties. 8.4. GENETICALLY ENGINEERING CELLS Our description of DNA replication, mutation, and selection and the natural mechanisms for gene transfer provide the reader with a knowledge of all the tools necessary to geneti-cally engineer a cell. The purposeful, predetermined manipulation of cells at the geneticlevel, an idea that was farfetched before 1970, is easily within the grasp of beginning col-lege students. Genetic engineering is a set of tools and not a scientific discipline. Although difficult to define precisely, it involves the manipulation of DNA outside the cell to create artificial genesor novel combinations of genes with predesigned control elements. Because many of thesemanipulations can be done outside the cell, we can circumvent species limitations that limit the age-old techniques of mutation and selection and breeding (e.g., we can express a human pro-tein in E. coli ). Learning how to use these tools is the basis of modern biotechnology. 8.4.1. Basic Elements of Genetic Engineering An overview of the strategy typically employed in genetic engineering is given in Fig. 8.7. The strategy makes use of recombinant DNA techniques, the ability to isolate genes from one organism and recombine the isolated gene with other DNA that can be propagated ina similar or unrelated host. Most of our discussion will be drawn from approaches for ge-netically engineering bacteria. The first step is obtaining the gene of interest. A simple, brute-force approach is shotgun cloning . Here the DNA from the donor organism is cut into fragments using re- striction enzymes . If an efficient screening procedure is available, large numbers of host cells with random fragments of DNA can be screened for those with a property related tothe desired gene. 230 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 230Most often, such a shotgun approach is very inefficient. More specific approaches use hybridization . A probe can be synthesized chemically to be complementary to a por- tion of the gene. The probe is usually much shorter than the gene, but sufficiently longthat it is unlikely for other genes to have the same complementary DNA sequence. Theconstruction of the probe requires some knowledge of either the nucleotide sequence ofthe desired gene or a partial amino acid sequence for the desired gene. Since the genetic Sec. 8.4 Genetically Engineering Cells 231 Figure 8.7. Overview of the essential steps in genetic engineering: moving a gene from one organism to another. (With permission, from T. D. Brock, K. M. Brock, and D. M.Ward, Basic Microbiology with Applications , 3d ed., Pearson Education, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1986, p. 169.)ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 231code is degenerate, the deduction of the actual nucleotide sequence is ambiguous. This ambiguity requires that a variety of probes be generated. Hybridization reactions requirethe donor DNA to be both fragmented and converted into single strands that can reactwith the single-stranded probes. An alternative to hybridization is total chemical synthesis of a gene that corresponds to the desired protein. This alternative requires knowledge of the amino acid sequence ofthe desired protein. An artificial gene may code for exactly the same protein as in nature,even if the sequence of nucleotides on the artificial gene is not identical to the naturalgene. Chemical synthesis also allows us to produce specifically modified natural proteinsor potentially totally human-designed proteins. Another method to obtain the desired gene is particularly useful for genes with in- trons . Since bacteria lack the cellular machinery to cutout introns and to do m-RNA splic- ing, eucaryotic genes with introns cannot be directly placed in bacteria to make a desiredprotein. Often we wish to make these proteins in bacteria, since the bacteria grow muchmore rapidly and are much easier and cheaper to culture. Often the processed m-RNA for the desired gene can be isolated directly from the donor organism's cytoplasm (using hy-bridization probes). Once the m-RNA is isolated, the enzyme reverse transcriptase (see Chapter 4) can be used to synthesize a DNA molecule with the corresponding nucleotidesequence; this molecule is called complementary DNA or c DNA . Once the desired gene is isolated or made, it can be inserted into a small piece of carrier DNA called a vector . Typically, vectors are plasmids, although temperate viruses can be used. The process for preparing the donor DNA and vector for recombination andthe actual joining of the DNA segments requires special enzymes (see Fig. 8.8); we havediscussed these enzymes in our previous consideration of DNA replication and genetic re-combination. A wide variety of restriction enzymes exist that will cut DNA at a different prespecified site. Most vectors have maps showing the various restriction sites; importantexamples are EcoR1 from E. coli nucleotides of single-stranded DNA projectingfrom the cut site. Pieces of DNA with complementary \"sticky ends\" naturally associate,and in a mixture of cut vector and donor DNA, some pieces of donor DNA will associatewith vector DNA. DNA ligase can permanently join these ends. The mixture bearing the desired vector-donor combinations is then moved into the recipient or host cell. In most cases this is done by transformation, although other tech-niques can be used if transformation of the host is difficult. Note that the construction ofthe desired vector-donor DNA usually results in a mixture (e.g., some vector moleculesmay be opened and rejoined without donor DNA being inserted, or multiple copies ofdonor DNA may be inserted, or DNA contaminants of the donor DNA mixture may be-come inserted into the vector). Consequently, an efficient method to screen transformantsfor those with the desired vector-donor DNA combination is important. Most vectors contain selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance or the genes to make essential growth factors that have been removed by mutation from the host cell. Inthe latter case, growth in minimal medium is possible only in the presence of the plasmid.These selectable markers allow the isolation of genetic clones that have been successfully transformed. A further screening step is then necessary to ensure that the donor DNA ispresent and being expressed (i.e., a functional protein is being made from the donor DNA). 232 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 232Obtaining good expression from the donor DNA is often a difficult challenge. Care- ful selection of stably propagating vectors and of promoters, checks to ensure that the cor-rect reading frame is being used, and the selection of host cell backgrounds that do notinteract unfavorably with the \"foreign\" protein are all important considerations. Discus-sions of how to obtain and maintain high levels of expression will occupy much of Chap-ter 14. We can screen for the expression of donor DNA, for example, if the product Sec. 8.4 Genetically Engineering Cells 233 Figure 8.8. Use of special enzymes in genetic engineering. (a) The specific cutting of DNA by a restriction enzyme results in the formation of ends that contain smallsingle-stranded complementary sequences (\"sticky ends\"). (b) The enzyme DNA ligaselinks pieces of DNA that have become associated by their sticky ends. (With permission,from T. D. Brock, K. M. Brock, and D. M.

Also, antibodies to the target protein when tagged with a radiolabel orfluorescent label can be used to identify colonies expressing the target protein. An important tool in working with both proteins and DNA fragments or plasmids is electrophoresis . In protein electrophoresis an electric field is applied to a solution contain- ing proteins placed at the top of a gel (typically made of polyacrylamide). The proteinsmigrate through the porous structure of the gel in a direction and at a speed that reflectboth the size and the net change of the molecule. The gel reduces the effects of convec-tion, although thermally induced convection can be problematic in large gels. For proteinsSDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) is commonlyused. In this technique the proteins are denatured by heating with SDS and mercap-toethanol. Mercaptoethanol is a reducing agent to break disulfide bands. Individualpolypeptide chains form a complex with SDS, which is negatively charged. The nega-tively charged complex then migrates through the gel at a rate that reflects the molecularweight of the polypeptide. In a typical SDS-PAGE gel there is a lane with polymers ofknown molecular weight. Other lanes will have samples with unknown proteins. After adefined period of time (typically a few hours) the process is stopped and the gel exam-ined. Each protein forms a band. With some types of electrophoresis the band is high-lighted by use of stains. Smaller molecules travel a greater distance. The molecular weightof a protein band in the unknown sample can be estimated by comparing to the lane withthe molecular weight standard. The relative amount of a protein can be determined by theintensity of the band. Various forms of gel electrophoresis can be used to determine if a protein from a clone is being produced and at what relative level. A particularly useful procedure is animmunoblot or Western blot. Here a nondenaturing gel is run to separate proteins, they are blotted onto nitrocellulose paper, and the protein identified by binding to a specific anti-body followed by a radioactive marker that binds antigen-antibody complexes. The bandis visualized by exposure of the nitrocellulose paper to x-ray film. Because of the high de-gree of specificity of antibodies, a positive band is good confirmation that the proteinband represents a target product rather than another protein of similar molecular weight. Similarly DNA molecules can be separated by gel electrophoresis using agarose or polyacrylamide. DNA is negatively charged. DNA fragments (e.g., from digestion withrestriction enzymes) can be separated by molecular weight as well as plasmids from largerDNA elements. The DNA separates based on molecular weight. The DNA can be recov-ered by simply cutting out the part of the gel corresponding to the band for the desiredDNA and eluting. The DNA is invisible unless stained. One approach is to expose DNA toa dye that fluoresces when under ultraviolet light. With shotgun cloning (which produces a large gene library or gene bank ), a desired colony can be isolated by using radiolabeled RNA or DNA probes complementary to thecloned gene. Such a procedure involves transferring colonies to nitrocellulose filter paper,where they are lysed. After lysis, the DNA spills out to bind on the filter paper. The paperis flooded with the probe; the probe only binds to the DNA with a complementary se-quence (hybridization) and excess probe is washed away. If the filter is covered with x-rayfilm, radioactivity will expose the film (visible as a black spot), identifying whichcolonies had the donor DNA. This procedure identifies colonies that have been trans-formed with the desired DNA; expression has to be established in separate experiments. 234 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 234Another approach to using a gene library to find genes that express proteins with certain functions is the use of display technologies. Most common are phage displays and bacterial displays . For example, a bacteriophage or bacterium may display on its surfaces proteins encoded from genes derived from the library. Each cell may display at most onlya few of these gene products. An example of the use of such a system is the isolation of acell producing a gene product that will bind to a particular molecule ( ligand ). The ligand can be bound to a surface, and only those cells expressing a protein on their surface thatbinds to that ligand can \"stick\" to the surface. These cells that stick can be recovered andpropagated to make more copies of the gene and protein. Although our focus is on amplifying the number of genes as a basis for producing target proteins or altering pathways, gene cloning is often done to obtain many copies of aparticular gene. The amplification of the gene number facilitates gene sequencing andanalysis. This amplification is particularly important for mapping genomes (e.g., thehuman genome project), for diagnosis of disease-causing organisms (both microbial andviral), for biologists studying evolution, and for forensic scientists. An alternative technique to traditional gene cloning is a technique called the polym- erase chain reaction, or PCR . PCR is the preferred method to amplify DNA. In this tech- nique a target sequence of interest is a gene on double-stranded DNA. The technique requires that two short primer sequences ( < 20 nucleotides) on either side of the target be known. If heat is applied, the complementary strands of double-stranded DNA separate.While separated, two pieces of chemically synthesized DNA (the primers) are added.Each primer binds to complementary sequences. A heat-stable DNA polymerase from abacterium that grows in hot springs (the Taq polymerase) is added and quickly synthesizesfrom the primers the complementary DNA strands using the four nucleotides (A, G, T,and C) added to the reaction mixture. At the end of the cycle, there are two copies of theoriginal gene. If the cycle is repeated, those two copies become four. Thirty cycles can bedone in less than a day. Thus, from a single gene copy, 2 30copies of the gene can be gen- erated, more than a billionfold increase. Thermal cyclers and PCR kits are commerciallyavailable. This simple summary does not cover all the intricacies investigators often face in obtaining industrially useful clones. However, the procedures discussed here are applica-ble in most cases where plasmids are used as vectors to transform bacteria such as E. coli. 8.4.2. Genetic Engineering of Higher Organisms The direct genetic engineering of higher organisms can be a great deal more difficult be- cause of a lack of good effective techniques to introduce foreign DNA and of an under-standing of host cell genetics. The reader should be aware of the techniques beingdeveloped to work with some of these host systems. The introduction of foreign DNA intohigher organisms is usually termed transfection . Some plants are subject to infection with the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens . A. tumefaciens contains a plasmid that contains a section known as T-DNA. This T-DNA can integrate into the plant chromosome. If genes are inserted into the T-DNA region, they Sec. 8.4 Genetically Engineering Cells 235For forensic studies or phylogenic studies on relationships of organisms a non-protein coding sequence may be the target.ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 235can be incorporated ultimately in the plant chromosome. Unfortunately, most cereal plants are not readily susceptible to Agrobacterium infection. The biolistic process for obtaining plant transformation is to coat small (1 -mm diam- eter) projectiles (e.g., of tungsten) and shoot these into cells at high velocity. Results withthis approach have been remarkably successful, and this technique is fairly general. Another fairly general approach is electroporation, which involves a brief high- voltage electric discharge that renders cells permeable to DNA. Electroporation can beused with animal, plant, fungal, and bacterial systems. The formation of protoplasts can enhance transfection but is not essential. A protoplast is a cell in which the outer cell en-velope has been removed so that only the cytoplasmic membrane remains. Chemically or electrically mediated protoplast fusion is another technique for trans- ferring genetic information from one cell to another. Such approaches have been particu-larly useful with some fungi for which few or no plasmids have been identified. Protoplastfusion can be interspecies and can result in stable hybrids with desired properties due torecombination events between the two genomes or extrachromosomal pieces of DNA. For most animal cells, genetic manipulation can be accomplished by modifying viruses to become vectors. For example, in the insect cell system a baculovirus can be modified so as to place a desired gene under the control of a very strong promoter at theexpense of a gene product that is unessential for viral replication in cell culture. Although the basic conceptual approach to genetic engineering is rather straightfor- ward, its implementation can vary widely in difficulty. The level of difficulty depends onthe nature of the gene product and its corresponding gene, as well as the character of thedesired host cell. Techniques to improve the ease of obtaining desirable genetic modifica-tion will undoubtedly continue to be developed. The ultimate limitation will be humanimagination and wisdom. 8.5. GENOMICS Genomics is the set of experimental and computational tools which allow the genetic blueprints of life to be read. A genome is an organism's total inheritable DNA. We now have complete genomic information on about 50 microbes, as well as representative ani-mals and plants. Most importantly, we have the genomic sequence for humans. This se-quence information is simply a string of nucleotide letters. Functional genomics is the process of relating genetic blueprints to the structure and behavior of an organism. Tocompletely relate physiological behavior to this sequence of nucleotides is an extremelychallenging problem. It is a problem to which bioengineers can make a significantcontribution. Much of the progress in molecular biology has been due to a reductionist approach in which a subcomponent has been isolated and studied in detail. This approach has beenvery fruitful in learning about the detailed mechanisms at the heart of living systems. Thedetailed sequence information now available is the ultimate limit in reduction in biology.There is increasing interest in asking how the individual subcellular components work to-gether. Function arises from the complex interactions of the components. A systems engi-neering approach allows one to integrate component parts into a functional whole. 236 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 236While genetic information is linear and static, cellular systems are highly nonlinear, dynamic systems that respond to their environment and regulate gene expression. Overthe next decades a focus of biochemical engineering, in conjunction with other disci-plines, will be relating this linear sequence information to those nonlinear dynamicalsystems. The role of the bioengineer is twofold. One role is as an enabler, by making better tools for rapid analysis of DNA sequences, of expression of m-RNAs, and of a cell's total proteins ( proteomics ). A second role is as an interpreter and organizer of genetic informa- tion; this role usually involves mathematical modeling. 8.5.1. Experimental T echniquesThe primary tools of genomics are used for DNA sequencing, detecting which m-RNAs are expressed, and determining which proteins are present in a cell or tissue. The nu-cleotide sequence of DNA fragments can be determined on a sequencing gel. The key tothis method is the use of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, which are derivatives ofthe natural deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and lack the hydroxyl (OH) group at the 3\u00a2position. For example, ddATP is the derivative dATP. If a strand of DNA is being repli- cated and if ddATP is inserted into the position normally occupied by dATP, replication isstopped. The OH group at the 3 \u00a2position is essential for continued replication. The basic process for sequencing is shown in Fig. 8.9. It is easiest to imagine reactions in four sepa-rate tubes labelled A, T, C, and G. To each tube is added the DNA fragment to be se-quenced, DNA polymerase, a stoichiometeric excess of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP,and an oligonucleotide primer for the DNA polymerase to use. The reaction is analogousto the first step in the PCR reaction. Only one strand of the DNA fragment to be se-quenced is read. In addition to the above reactants, in each tube a small amount of ddNTPis added. For example, in tube A ddATP is added, in tube T, ddTP, and so on. Since theamount of ddNTP added is small in tube N, several reaction products are formed. In tubeN, the first time dNTP or ddNTP must be added to the growing copy of the original DNAfragment, there is a high probability that dNTP will be added and the chain can be ex-tended. However, there is also a finite probability (determined by the ratio of ddNTP todNTP) that ddNTP will be added and the chain extension will be terminated. At the sec-ond position where N is required, either ddNTP or dNTP will be added. As above, somechains will be terminated, and others will continue to extend. This reaction continues, andtube N will generate fragments of different sizes, all of which end in the letter N. Thesefragments are separated by gel electrophoresis, and the sequence of the DNA fragmentcan be read directly from the gel (as shown in Fig. 8.9). This technique is limited to rela-tively short DNA fragments (a few hundred nucleotides). For sequencing genomes this technique can be modified and automated. The basic approach to sequence a large genome is to cut it into millions of overlapping fragments of2,000 to 10,000 base pairs in length. Each fragment is ligated into a plasmid, which istransformed into E. coli . This approach is termed a shotgun approach, and the E. coli form a living genomic library. These colonies are robotically picked, identified with a barcode,and placed in a 384-well plate. The amount of the cloned DNA fragment is amplifiedusing PCR. From each end of the fragment 500 letters are replicated using the ddNTP Sec. 8.5 Genomics 237ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 237approach described above. For the purposes of automation a fluorescent dye is used for each ddNTP. Four different dyes are used to distinguish A, T, C, and G. These labelledfragments are then read in automated sequencing machines. These machines rely on 104glass capillaries; capillary electrophoresis is used to separate the fragments by size. As thefragments exit the capillary, a laser beam detects the color of the dye at the end of thefragment. The information is led to a computer and the 500-letter sequence is determined.One company, Celera, expects to use such machines to read 100 million letters of DNAsequence per day. These sequences are stored in a computer; computer alogrithms arethen used to align the overlapping sequences. Because of the large number of fragments, this information processing is very chal- lenging. For the human genome 70 million separate sequences are necessary to achievesufficient overlap to reconstruct the whole human genome (about 3 billion letters). Thistechnique cannot do a perfect reconstruction, but one that is effectively complete. One 238 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8 Figure 8.9. Example of a sequencing gel to obtain the nucleotide sequence of a DNA fragment. See text for details.ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 238problem is that in much of the human DNA there are long repeated sequences which com- plicate alignment. Only about 5% of human DNA encodes genes. The coding fraction ismuch higher in bacteria. Because of the smaller genome size and fewer complications,such as repeated sequences, bacterial genomes are easier to sequence. DNA sequencing is essentially a problem in information technology. Many feel that the current sequencing technology is comparable to computer technology in 1970. Thereare tremendous opportunities for engineers to design and construct devices to read andanalyze genomic information much more rapidly and cheaply. The intrinsic scale of ge-nomic information is the size of a nucleotide (about 0.34 nm). Recent advances in nano-technology may allow us to generate such instruments. Indeed, engineers have contributedsignificantly to a \"lab-on-a-chip\" device to do DNA sequencing. This device begins tomarry microtechnology and biotechnology. Another technology that is having a large impact on genomics is microarrays for mea- suring which genes are being expressed by measuring the corresponding m-RNA levels. These microarrays are high-density oligonucleotide arrays. These oligonucleotides hy-bridize with the corresponding m-RNA. For a known gene or protein an oligonucleotide can be synthesized that binds the corresponding m-RNA. Using photolithography, the manufac- turing of arrays oligonucleotides glass substrates of 1.64cm 2is now routine. Such arrays can simultaneously analyze expression from 6,000 to 10,000 genes. For bioprocesses the array can be used to determine which genes are up regu-lated or down regulated in response to a process change (e.g., temperature). An increase in m-RNA levels does not immediately correspond to a change in pro- tein level. Because different m-RNAs have different rates of degradation, efficiency of translation, and so on, changes in m-RNA expression may not translate directly into changes in the protein content of a cell or tissue. Since the proteins are the primary com-ponents responsible for biological activity, a knowledge of the protein content of a cell ishighly valuable. Because proteins cannot be easily amplified like nucleic acids, measure-ments of all of the proteins in a cell (i.e., proteomics) is very difficult. Also proteins varygreatly in properties such as hydrophobicity. Currently there is no method that can mea-sure all proteins in a cell. The best available technique is two-dimensional gel elec-trophoresis. This technique is derived from the SDS-PAGE technique described earlier inthis chapter. For 2D gel electrophoresis two methods are combined. The first is to separateproteins in one direction (say the x-axis) according to their isoelectric point \u2014the pH at which the protein has no net charge. Using a special set of buffers, a pH gradient can beestablished in a polyacrylamide gel. When the proteins are subjected to an electric field,they will move to the pH equal to their isoelectric point and remain there. After equilibra-tion with an anionic surfactant, the proteins are then subjected to an electric field in theother direction (say the y-axis). The proteins will remain at the same pH but move down the y-axis according to their molecular weight. By separating protein mixtures using these two parameters (isoelectric point and molecular weight), a complex protein mixture canbe resolved into separate spots. Often those \"spots\" can be removed and analyzed by tan-dem mass spectrometry to identify the protein's sequence. The technique of 2-D gel electrophoresis is time consuming and expensive. Signifi- cant improvements will be necessary for routine analysis of cell and tissue protein con-tent. Better gels or methods of protein separation are needed. Promising approaches Sec. 8.5 Genomics 239ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 239combine microtechnology, liquid chromatographies, and mass spectrometry techniques. The engineering challenges in making a practical device are significant. 8.5.2. Computational T echniques The wealth of data emerging from these new experimental techniques is overwhelming. Generally, DNA sequence information could be used to identify which sequences aregenes that encode for proteins, what these proteins are, what their biological function is,and ultimately how these genes are regulated. Deciding what nucleotide sequence corresponds to a gene is not always a clear-cut process. Investigators look for \"open reading frames\" or ORFs. An ORF is a nucleotidesequence without a \"stop\" signal that encodes some minimal number of amino acids(about 100). In prokaryotes, identifying ORFs is fairly straightforward. In eukaryotes, be-cause of introns and exons, assignment of ORFs is complicated. Some computer programscan recognize probable (consensus) intron/exon boundaries. When a prospective gene is identified, we need to know the function of the corre- sponding protein. In some cases the function can be deduced by comparison to databaseswith amino acid sequence information on known proteins. In some cases the amino acidsequence and function of a protein is conserved across species. With a highly conserved protein we might find similiar amino acid sequences\u2014for example, in the fruit fly and humans. In this case we would determine how homologous the two amino acid sequences were. We then might infer that the human gene encodesa protein with similiar function. Conservation of amino acids near a catalytic or bindingsite is particularly critical. Efficient computer algorithms to do such searches are underdevelopment. Ideally one would like to predict protein structure and function solely from the amino acid sequence. Heroic efforts have been made to accomplish this goal, but thereis no good general solution. Understanding the folding of proteins into their three-dimensional configuration is a computationally difficult problem. Even with well-studied organisms, such as E. coli, we generally can guess the func- tion of only 50 %of the genes. Clearly, knowing the full genome sequence has told us how little we really understand. The process of identifying single genes and the function of thecorresponding genes has been the focus of bioinformatics . Even if we knew the identity of every gene in a cell and the function of each corre- sponding protein, we would have an incomplete understanding of function and cellularphysiology. A list of the proteins and their functions needs to be supplemented by an un-derstanding of cellular structure and regulation. A combination of proteins can form meta-bolic pathways, and there will be a corresponding genetic circuit. Relating the cell's\"parts list\" to its dynamic, physiological state is an unmet challenge that provides excit-ing, long-term opportunities for bioengineers. In particular, models of cells and metabolic circuits as discussed in Chapter 6 pro- vide tools with which to organize data and to understand biological function. Simple stoi-chiometric models of central metabolism have been used with good success to identifywhich genes are essential to a cell in a particular environment. Models that also incorpo-rate kinetics and regulatory structure are in development. Such models will be key to 240 How Cellular Information Is Altered Chap. 8ch08 10/11/01 5:23 PM Page 240relating cellular physiology to the genome. Such an understanding will provide important guidance to development of future bioprocesses. 8.6. SUMMARY A cell's genotype represents the cell's genetic potential, whereas its phenotype represents the expression of a culture's potential. The genotype of a cell can be altered by mutations . Examples of mutations are point mutations , deletions , and additions . Additions are usu- ally the result of insertion sequences that \"jump\" from one position to another. Mutations may be selectable or unselectable . The rate of mutation can be enhanced by the addition of chemicals called mutagens or by radiation. Auxotrophs are of particular use in genetic analysis and as a basis for some bioprocesses. Another useful class of mu-tants is conditional mutants. Gene transfer from one cell to another augments genetic information in ways that are not possible through mutation only. Genetic recombination of different DNA mole- cules occurs within most cells. Thus, genetic information transferred from another organ-ism may become a permanent part of the recipient cell. The three primary modes of genetransfer in bacteria are transformation , transduction , and Self-replicating, autonomous, extrachromosomal pieces called plasmids play important roles in transformation. Episomes , which are closely related to plasmids, are the key elements in conjugation. Bacteriophages are critical to generalized transduction, while temperate phages are key to specialized transduction. Internal gene transfer can occur due to the presence of transposons, which probably also play a role in the assembly of new plasmids. We can use gene transfer in conjunction with restriction enzymes and ligases to ge- netically engineer cells. In-vitro procedures to recombine isolated donor DNA genes withvector DNA (for example, plasmids, temperate phages, or modified viruses) are called re- combinant DNA techniques . Once the vector with the DNA donor insert has been con- structed, it can be moved to a recipient cell through any natural or artificial method ofgene transfer. Although transformation is the most common technique in bacteria, a largevariety of artificial methods have been developed (e.g., biolistic process, electroportation, modification of infective agents, and protoplast fusion ) to insert foreign DNA into a host cell. Genomics is the set of experimental and computational tools which allows the ge- netic blueprints of a whole organism to be read. Functional genomics is the process of re- lating genetic blueprints to the behavior and structure of an organism.

INTRODUCTION So far we have discussed what cells are, how they work, and how to describe their growth in simple reactors. We now begin our discussion of how to use these cells in processes.We will explore some more complicated reactor strategies and why they might be consid-ered for use in real processes. Chapter 10 will give more details on reactor design, andChapter 11 will detail how to recover products from these reactors. These chapters shouldgive the reader an understanding of how real bioprocesses can be assembled. An important decision for constructing any process concerns the configuration the reactor system should take. The choice of reactor and operating strategy determines prod-uct concentration, number and types of impurities, degree of substrate conversion, yields,and whether sustainable, reliable performance can be achieved. Unlike many traditionalchemical processes, the reactor section represents a very major component (usually > 50%) of the total capital expenditures. Choices at the reactor level and of the biocatalyst determine the difficulty of the separation. Thus, our choice of reactor must be made in thecontext of the total process: biocatalyst, reactor, and separation and purification train.ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 2459.2. CHOOSING THE CULTIVATION METHOD One of the first decisions is whether to use a batch or continuous cultivation scheme. Although a simple batch and continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor (CFSTR) represent ex-tremes (we will soon learn about other reactors with intermediate characteristics), consid-eration of these two extreme alternatives will clarify some important issues in reactorselection. First, we can consider productivity. The simplest case is for the production of cell mass or a primary product. For a batch reactor, four distinct phases are present: lag phase,exponential growth phase, harvesting, and preparation for a new batch (e.g., cleaning,sterilizing, and filling). Let us define t las the sum of the times required for the lag phase, harvesting, and preparation. The value for tlwill vary with size of the equipment and the nature of the fermentation but is normally in the range of several hours (3 to 10 h). Thus,the total time to complete a batch cycle ( t c) is (9.1) where Xmis the maximal attainable cell concentration and X0is the cell concentration at inoculation. The total amount of cell mass produced comes from knowing the total amount of growth-extent-limiting nutrient present and its yield coefficient: (9.2) The rate of cell mass production in one batch cycle ( rb) is (9.3) As discussed in Chapter 6, the maximum productivity of a chemostat is found by differen- tiating DXwith respect to Dand setting dDX/dD to zero. The value for Doptimal when simple Monod kinetics apply is given by eq. 6.83, and the corresponding Xcan be deter- mined to be (9.4) Thus, the best productivity that could be expected from a chemostat where Monod kinet- ics apply is Dopt Xopt, or (9.5) Under normal circumstances S0>>Ks, so the rate of chemostat biomass production, rc,is approximately (9.6)rD X +- [] / () m1 000XY S KK S KXS s s s opt =+ - + {}/ ()00rYS XX tbXS mm l=+/ mm l =+1 Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 246The ratio for rates of biomass formation is (9.7) Most commercial fermentations operate with Xm/X0\u00aa10 to 20. Thus, we would ex- pect continuous systems to always have a significant productivity advantage for primaryproducts. For example, an E. coli fermentation with X m/X0=20, tl=5 h, and mm=1.0 h-1 would yield rc,opt/rb=8. Based on this productivity advantage we might be surprised to learn that most com- mercial bioprocesses are batch systems. Why? There are several answers. The first is that eq. 9.7 applies only to growth-associated products. Many secondary products are not made by growing cells; growth represses product formation. Under suchcircumstances, product is made only at very low dilution rates, far below those values op-timal for biomass formation. For secondary products, the productivity in a batch reactormay significantly exceed that in a simple chemostat. Another primary reason for the choice of batch systems over chemostats is genetic instability . The biocatalyst in most bioprocesses has undergone extensive selection. These highly \"bred\" organisms often grow less well than the parental strain. A chemostat im-poses strong selection pressure for the most rapidly growing cell. Back-mutation from theproductive specialized strain to one similar to the less productive parental strain (i.e., a re-vertant) is always present. In the chemostat the less productive variant will become domi-nant, decreasing productivity. In the batch culture the number of generations available (< 25 from slant cultures to a commercial-scale fermenter) for the revertant cell to out- grow the more productive strain is limited. Cells at the end of the batch are not reused.These considerations of genetic stability are very important for cells with recombinantDNA and are discussed in detail in Chapter 14. Another consideration is operability and reliability. Batch cultures can suffer great variability from one run to another. Variations in product quality and concentration createproblems in downstream processing and are undesirable. However, long-term continuousculture can be problematic; pumps may break, controllers may fail, and so on. Mainte-nance of sterility (absence of detectable foreign organisms) can be very difficult toachieve for periods of months, and the consequences of a loss of sterility are more severethan with batch culture. One other factor determining reactor choice is market economics. A continuous sys- tem forms the basis of a dedicated processing system\u2014dedicated to a single product.Many fermentation products are required in small amounts, and demand is difficult toproject. Batch systems provide much greater flexibility. The same reactor can be used fortwo months to make product A and then for the next three for product B and the rest of theyear for product C. Most bioprocesses are based on batch reactors. Continuous systems are used to make single-cell protein (SCP), and modified forms of continuous culture are used inwaste treatment, in ethanol production, and for some other large-volume, growth-associated products such as latic acid. Let us consider some modifications to these reactor modes.r rX Xtc bm ml,opt=+ln 0m Sec. 9.2 247ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 2479.3. MODIFYING BATCH AND CONTINUOUS REACTORS 9.3.1. Chemostat with RecycleMicrobial conversions are autocatalytic, and the rate of conversion increases with cell concentration. To keep the cell concentration higher than the normal steady-state level in achemostat, cells in the effluent can be recycled back to the reactor. Cell recycle increasesthe rate of conversion (or productivity) and also increases the stability of some systems(e.g., waste-water treatment) by minimizing the effects of process perturbation. Cells inthe effluent stream are either centrifuged, filtered, or settled in a conical tank for recy-cling. Consider the chemostat system with cell recycle as depicted in Fig. 9.1. A material balance on cell (biomass) concentration around the fermenter yields the followingequation: (9.8) where ais the recycle ratio based on volumetric flow rates, Cis the concentration factor or ratio of cell concentration in the cell recycle stream to the cell concentration in the re-actor effluent, Fis nutrient flow rate, Vis culture volume, X 0and X1are cell concentra- tions in feed and recycle streams, and X2is cell concentration in effluent from the cell separator. At steady state, and if dX1/dt =0 and X0=0 (that is, sterile feed); then eq. 9.8 be- comes (9.9) Since C >1 and a(1 -C)<0, then mnet <D. That is, a chemostat can be operated at dilu- tion rates higher than the specific growth rate when cell recycle is used.

Cell concentrations and productivities are higher withcell recycle, resulting in higher rates of substrate consumption. Systems with cell recycleare used extensively in waste treatment and are finding increasing use in ethanol produc-tion. The application of cell recycle reactors in waste treatment is detailed in Chapter 16.The equations differ from the case above due to the inclusion of a term for endogenousmetabolism (i.e., k d). The basic concept of operation at flows above the \"washout\" rate ap- plies when kd0. Example 9.1 In a chemostat with cell recycle, as shown in Fig. 9.1, the feed flow rate and culture volumes are F=100 ml/h and V=1000 ml, respectively.

Solution Using eq. 9.9, we determine =[1 + (1 -1.5)0.7](0.1) = mg =0.065 h-1 Then A biomass balance around the concentrator yields for secondary metabolite production, the growth and product-formation steps need to be separated, since optimal conditions for each step aredifferent. Conditions such as temperature, pH, and limiting nutrients may be varied ineach stage, resulting in different cell physiology and cellular products in multistagesystems. An example of a multistage system that may be beneficial is in the culture of geneti- cally engineered cells. To improve genetic stability, a plasmid-carrying recombinant DNAusually uses an inducible promoter to control production of the target protein (see Chap-ter 8). In the uninduced state, the plasmid-containing cell grows at nearly the same rate asthe cell that loses the plasmid (a revertant), so the plasmid-free cell holds little growthadvantage over the plasmid-containing cell. However, if the inducer is added, the plas-mid-containing cells will make large quantities of the desired protein product but willhave greatly reduced growth rates. Thus, a single-stage chemostat would not be suitablefor the production of the target protein because of resulting problems in genetic stability.A multistage system can circumvent this problem. In the first stage, no inducer is addedand the plasmid-containing cell can be maintained easily (usually an antibiotic is added tokill plasmid-free cells; see Chapter 14 for a more complete discussion). In the second g/l g/lnet 02 00 6 504 8 01 1 0 04 805 0 065 7310 250 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 250stage, the inducer is added and large quantities of product are made. Cells defective in product synthesis should not overtake the culture (at least not completely), because freshgenetically unaltered cells are being continuously fed to the reactor. Thus, the two-stagesystem can allow the stable continuous production of the target protein when it would beimpossible in a simple chemostat. Perhaps an easier situation to consider is the production of a secondary product (e.g., ethanol or an antibiotic). Here we worry not so much about a mixture of subpopula-tions, but that conditions that promote growth completely repress product formation. Avery large scale multistage system for ethanol production is currently in use. A multistagesystem of CFSTR approaches PFR behavior. A PFR mimics the batch system, wherespace time (the time it takes the culture fluid to reach a specific location in the PFR) re-places culture time. A multistage system is much like taking the batch growth curve anddividing it into sections, with each section being \"frozen\" in a corresponding stage of themultistage system. As in the batch reactor, the culture's physiological state progressesfrom one stage to the next. The mathematical analysis of the multistage system that we present here is imper- fect. Growth in the second and subsequent stages is intrinsically unbalanced growth, eventhough it is steady-state growth. New cells entering the second or subsequent stage arecontinuously adapting to the new conditions in that stage. Consequently, unstructuredmodels are not expected to give completely accurate predictions. However, we use un-structured models here due to their simplicity and to illustrate at least some aspects ofmultistage systems. A two-stage chemostat system is depicted in Fig. 9.3. Biomass and substrate bal- ances on the first stage yield the following equations (ignoring endogeneous metabolism): (9.15) (9.16) The biomass balance for the second stage yields (9.17) FX FX V X VdX dt12 2 2 2 22-+ = mXYSSXSM 10 1=-/()SKD Ds m11 1=- m Sec. 9.3 Modifying Batch and Continuous Reactors 251 Figure 9.3. Two-stage chemostat system.ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM becomes (9.18) where X1/X2<1 and m2<D2. The substrate balance for the limiting substrate in the second stage is (9.19) At steady state, eq. 9.19 becomes (9.20) where Equations 9.18 and 9.20 can be solved simultaneously for X2and S2by substituting m2 = mmS2/(Ks+ S2) in both equations or any other functional form that describes m2. When a feed stream is added to the second stage, then the design equations change. The second feed stream may contain additional nutrients, inducers, hormones, or in-hibitors. Biomass balance for the second stage in this case is (9.21) At steady state when X\u00a2=0, eq. 9.21 becomes (9.22) where Substrate balance for the second stage yields (9.23) Equations 9.22 and 9.23 need to be solved simultaneously for X 2and S2. We can generalize these equations for a system with no additional streams added to second or subsequent units. If we do a balance around the nth stage on biomass, substrate, and product, we find (9.24a) rX S D X Xxn x n n n n,(,) ( ) =--1FS F S F F for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9ch09 or (9.26b) where Dn=F/Vn,qnis the mean residence time in the nth stage, and rx,n,rs,n,and rp,nall represent rates of reaction in the nth stage. The preceding set of equations lends itself to machine calculations. However, graphical approaches to multistage design can also be used and have the advantage thatthe functional form of the growth or production rate need not be known. All that is re-quired is a batch growth curve. However, the transfer of the information from batchgrowth curve to predictions of the multistage system still requires the assumption of bal-anced growth. Hence, the analysis must be used with caution. In at least one case (the pro-duction of spores from Bacillus ), this approach has made experimentally verifiable predictions of the performance of a six-stage system. The graphical approaches make use of eqs. 9.24 to 9.26. One approach is to use a of 1/( dX/dt ) versus Xor 1/( dP/dt ) versus Pderived batch growth curves. This corresponds to using eqs. 9.24b and 9.26b. The size of the required reactor is determinedby the area of the rectangle described with sides X n-Xn - ). area of the rectangle is q, and if Fis known, Vcan be calculated. An alter- native approach avoids some trial-and-error solutions that are necessary with the first ap-proach. This second approach requires plots of dX/dt versus X and dP/dt versus P. The intersection of the reaction curve with a line from the mass balance equation (e.g., eq. 9.24a) determines the exit concentration of Xor P, while the slope of the line deter- mines D, and if Fis known, Vcan be found. We illustrate the use of these approaches in Example 9.2. Example 9.2 Data for the production of a secondary metabolite from a small-scale batch reactor are shown in Fig. 9.4. Assume that two reactors, each with 700-l working volume, are available. You will useexactly the same culture conditions (medium, pH, temperature, and so on) as in the batch reac-tor. If the flow rate is 100 l/h, predict the outlet concentration of the product. Compare that to thevalue predicted if a single 1400-l reactor were used. Use both graphical approaches.qn nnn pn R DPP ) KrX S D Sec. 9.3 Modifying Batch and Continuous Reactors 253ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 253Solution The first step in using either graphical approach is to differentiate the data in the batch growth curve to yield dX/dt and dP/dt . The differentiation of experimental data can magnify errors present in the original data, so the values of dX/dt and dP/dt must be inter- preted cautiously. For the graphical approach illustrated in Fig. 9.5, we have plotted 1/( dX/dt ) versus Xand eqs. 9.26b. For q1=7 h (that is, 700 1/100 1/h), we must determine what value of X1will satisfy or Since a sterile feed is to be used, X0=0. By trial and error, we find on the graph that X1=7.2 g/l corresponds to 0.95 h/g/l =6.84 h. Given the accuracy with which Fig. 9.5 can be read, this is an acceptable solution. The product concentration that corresponds to X1=7.2 g/l is determined from the batch growth curve. As illustrated, X1=7.2 g/l is achieved at 9.4 h after inoculation; at the same time, the value for P1is 0.08 g/l. The effect of the second stage on the process is determined by using eq. 9.26b and not- ing that again Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9 Figure 9.4. Data for Example 9.2. Data are for the production of a secondary prod-uct in batch culture.ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 254By trial and error, we find that at P2=0.49 g/l which corresponds reasonably closely to 7 h. In this solution the reader should note that for the first stage, only solutions that exist for X1greater than the value of Xfor which 1/( dX/dt ) is a minimum are practically obtainable. Washout occurs if q1is too small. We can compare the result to a single-stage system with the same total volume as the two-stage system (Fig. 9.6). Here the trial-and-error approach indicates for X1=7.35 g/l that The value of P1that corresponds to X1=7.35 g/l is 0.10 g/l. Thus, the use of the two-stage system in this case increased product concentration from 0.10 to 0.49 g/l. An alternative graphical approach that eliminates the trial-and-error aspect of the first approach is shown in Fig. 9.7. Here eqs. 9.24a and 9.26a have been used.

The intersection of the reaction curve with the straight line determined by D1(X1 -X0) =D1X1is the solution to eq. 9.24a. For the second stage, we consider the produc- tion phase and use eq. 9.26a. The predicted values of X1and P2are the same as in the first approach. Note that the dP/dt -versus- Pcurve is displaced in time from the dX/dt -versus- Xcurve. Consequently, we use the dX/dt plot before using the dP/dt plot. 9.3.3. Fed-batch Operation In fed-batch culture, nutrients are continuously or semicontinuously fed, while effluent is removed discontinuously (Fig. 9.8). Such a system is called a repeated fed-batch culture . Fed-batch culture is usually used to overcome substrate inhibition or catabolite repressionby intermittent feeding of the substrate. If the substrate is inhibitory, intermittent additionof the substrate improves the productivity of the fermentation by maintaining the substrateconcentration low. Fed-batch operation is also called the semicontinuous system orvariable-volume continuous culture. Consider a batch culture where the concentration ofbiomass at a certain time is given by (9.27) XX Y S SXSM=+ -00 /( ) 256 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9 Figure 9.6.

When biomass concentration reaches its maximum value(X m), the substrate concentration is very low, S <<S0, and also X0<<X. That is, Xm\u00aaYM X/SS0. Suppose that at Xm@YM X/SS0, a nutrient feed is started at a flow rate F, with the substrate concentration S0. The total amount of biomass in the vessel is Xt=VX, where V is the culture volume at time t. The rate of increase in culture volume is (9.28) Integration of eq. 9.28 yields (9.29) where V0is the initial culture volume (l).

A fed-batch system operates at quasi-steady state when nutrientconsumption rate is nearly equal to nutrient feed rate. Since dX/dt =0 at quasi-steady state, then (9.33) If maintenance energy can be neglected, then (9.34) SKD Ds m@- mmmnet =+m ) ( / ) 2 258 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9 Figure 9.8.

At quasi-steady state, Xt=VXmand essentially all the substrate is consumed, so no significant level of substrate can accumulate. Therefore, (9.36) Equation 9.31 at quasi-steady state with S\u00aa0 yields (9.37) Integration of eq. 9.37 from t = 0 to t with the initial amount of biomass in the reactor being Xt 0yields (9.38) That is, the total amount of cell in the culture increases linearly with time (which is exper- imentally observed) in a fed-batch culture. Dilution rate and therefore mnetdecrease with time in a fed-batch culture. Since mnet =Dat quasi-steady state, the growth rate is con- trolled by the dilution rate. The use of unstructured models is an approximation, since mnet is a function of time. Product profiles in a fed-batch culture can be obtained by using the definitions of YP/Sor qP. When the product yield coefficient YP/Sis constant, at quasi-steady state with S<< S0 (9.39) or the potential product output is (9.40) When the specific rate of product formation qPis constant, (9.41) where Ptis the total amount of product in culture.

In some fed-batch operations, part of the culture volume is removed at certain inter- vals, since the reactor volume is limited. This operation is called the repeated fed-batch culture . The culture volume and dilution rate ( = mnet) undergo cyclical variations in this operation. If the cycle time twis constant and the system is always at quasi-steady state, then the product concentration at the end of each cycle is given by (9.45) where Dw=F/Vw, Vwis the culture volume at the end of each cycle, V0is the residual cul- ture volume after removal, gis the fraction of culture volume remaining at each cycle (=V0/Vw), and twis the cycle time.

Fed-batch culture is important for E. coli fermentations to make proteins from recom- binant DNA technology. To make a high concentration of product, it is desirable to grow theculture to very high cell density before inducing production of the target protein. If E. coli has an unlimited supply of glucose it will grow at a maximal rate, but produce organic acids(e.g., acetic acid) as by-products. The accumulation of these by-products inhibits growth.If glucose is fed at a rate that substains the growth rate at slightly less than maximal, E. coli uses the glucose more efficiently, making less by-product. Very high cell densities (50 to 100g/l) can be achieved. Fed-batch culture may benefit from active process control. For exam-ple, the feed rate of glucose could be controlled by measuring glucose concentration in themedium or the CO 2evolution rate using a feedback controller.

Modifying Batch Continuous Reactors 261ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 2619.3.4. Perfusion Systems An alternative to fed-batch culture is a perfusion system. Such systems are used most often with animal cell cultures (see Chapter 12). The basic characteristic is constantmedium flow, cell retention, and in some cases selective removal of dead cells. High celldensity can be achieved. Cell retention is usually achieved by membranes or screens or bya centrifuge capable of selective cell removal. When a membrane is used, the system hascharacteristics of an immobilized cell system (see Section 9.4) except the cells are usuallymaintained in suspension and mixed. With a selective removal/recycle the system ap-proaches the cell recycle reactor discussed earlier in this chapter. Figure 9.10 depicts onetype of perfusion system. The potential advantages of a perfusion system is the potential removal of cell de- bris and inhibitory by-products, removal of enzymes released by dead cells that may de-stroy product, shorter exposure time of product to potentially harsh production conditions(compared to batch or fed-batch operation), high per-unit volumetric productivity (due tohigh cell density and metabolism), and a rather constant environment. The primary disadvantage is that a large amount of medium is typically used and the nutrients in the medium are less completely utilized than in batch or fed-batch sys-tems. High medium usage is expensive, owing not only to the high cost of raw materialsbut also to the costs to prepare and sterilize the medium. Additionally, costs for wastetreatment increase. Typically the bioprocess engineer must consider the trade-off of im-proved product quality and reactor productivity with the extra costs associated with amore complex reactor system (membranes, pumps, centrifugal separator, etc.) and in-creased medium usage. The best choice depends on the specific situation. 262 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9 Fig. 9.10.

IntroductionImmobilization of cells as biocatalysts is almost as common as enzyme immobilization. Immobilization is the restriction of cell mobility within a defined space. Immobilized cellcultures have the following potential advantages over suspension cultures. 1.Immobilization provides high cell concentrations. 2.Immobilization provides cell reuse and eliminates the costly processes of cell recov- ery and cell recycle. 3.Immobilization eliminates cell washout problems at high dilution rates. 4.The combination of high cell concentrations and high flow rates (no washout re- strictions) allows high volumetric productivities. 5.Immobilization may conditions (i.e., contact, nutrient-product gradients, pH gradients) for cells, resulting inbetter performance of the biocatalysts (e.g., higher product yields and rates). 6.In some cases, immobilization improves genetic stability. 7.For some cells, protection against shear damage is important. The major limitation on immobilization is that the product of interest should be ex- creted by the cells. A further complication is that immobilization often leads to systemsfor which diffusional limitations are important. In such cases the control of microenviron-mental conditions is difficult, owing to the resulting heterogeneity in the system. With liv-ing cells, growth and gas evolution present significant problems in some systems and canlead to significant mechanical disruption of the immobilizing matrix. In Chapter 3 we discussed enzyme immobilization. Figure 3.16 provides a useful summary of immobilization strategies. Many of the ideas in enzyme immobilization havea direct counterpart in whole cells. However, the maintenance of a living cell in such asystem is more complex than maintaining enzymatic activity. The primary advantage ofimmobilized cells over immobilized enzymes is that immobilized cells can perform multi-step, cofactor-requiring, biosynthetic reactions that are not practical using purified en-zyme preparations. 9.4.2. Active Immobilization of Cells Active immobilization is entrapment or binding of cells by physical or chemical forces. The two major methods of active immobilization are entrapment and binding. Physical entrapment within porous matrices is the most widely used method of cell immobilization. Various matrices can be used for the immobilization porous polymers (agar, alginate, chitosan, gelatin, gel, polystyrene, and cellu-lose triacetate. ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 263Polymer beads should be porous enough to allow the transport of substrates and products in and out of the bead. They are usually formed in the presence of cells and canbe prepared by one of the following methods: 1.Gelation of polymers: Gelatin and agar beads may be prepared by mixing the liquid form of these polymers with cell suspensions and using a template to form beads.Reduction of temperature in the templates causes solidification of the polymers with thecells entrapped. Gel beads are usually soft and mechanically fragile. However, we can usea hard core (glass, plastic) and a soft gelatin shell with entrapped cells to overcome somemechanical problems associated with polymer beads. Because of diffusional limitations,the inner core of such beads is often not active, so this approach does not necessarily de-crease the amount of product made per bead. 2.Precipitation of polymers: Cells are dispersed in a polymer solution, and by changing the pH or the solvent, the polymer can be precipitated. The starting solution ofthe polymer has to be prepared with an organic solvent or a water-solvent mixture.Ethanol and acetone are examples of water-miscible solvents. Polymers used for this pur-pose are polystyrene, cellulose triacetate, and collagen. The direct contact of cells withsolvents may cause inactivation and even the death of cells. 3.Ion-exchange gelation: Ion-exchange gelation takes place when a water-soluble polyelectrolyte is mixed with a salt solution. Solidification occurs when the polyelec-trolyte reacts with the salt solution to form a solid gel. The most popular example of thiskind of gelation is the formation of Ca-alginate gel by mixing Na-alginate solution with aCaCl 2solution. polymers for cell- immobilization purposes. Ionic gels can be further stabilized by covalent cross-linking. 4.Polycondensation: Epoxy resins are prepared by polycondensation and can be used for cell immobilization. Polycondensation produces covalent networks with highchemical and mechanical stability. Usually, liquid precursors are cured with a multifunc-tional component. Functional groups usually are hydroxy, amino, epoxy, and isocyanategroups. Some examples of polymer networks obtained by polycondensation are epoxy,polyurethane, silica gel, gelatin-glutaraldehyde, albumin-glutaraldehyde, and collagen-glutaraldehyde. Severe reaction conditions (high temperature, low or high pH values) andtoxic functional groups may adversely affect the activity of cells. 5.Polymerization: Polymeric networks can be prepared by cross-linking copoly- mers of a vinyl group containing monomers. Polyacrylamide beads are the most widelyused of acrylamide and bisacrylamide. formation; methacrylamide,and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate are the most widely is usually initi-ated by copolymerization with a divinyl compound, such as methylenebis-acrylamide. Immobilization by polymerization is a simple method. The polymerizing solution is mixed with the cell suspension, and polymerization takes place to form a polymeric block,which is pressed through a sieve plate to obtain regular-shaped particles. Suspension oremulsion polymerization can also be used to form polymeric beads for cell entrapment. 264 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 264Encapsulation is another method of cell entrapment. Microcapsules are hollow, spherical particles bound by semipermeable membranes. Cells are entrapped within thehollow capsule volume. The transport of nutrients and products in and out of the capsuletakes place through the capsule membrane. Microcapsules have certain advantages overgel beads. More cells can be packed per unit volume of support material into capsules,and intraparticle diffusion limitations are less severe in capsules due to the presence ofliquid cell suspension in the intracapsule space. Various polymers can be used as capsulemembranes. Among these are nylon, collodion, polystyrene, acrylate, polylysine-alginatehydrogel, cellulose acetate-ethyl cellulose, and polyester membranes. Different mem-branes (composition and MW cutoff) may need to be used for different applications inorder to retain some high-MW products inside capsules and provide passage to low-MWnutrients and products. Another form of entrapment is the use of macroscopic membrane-based reactors. The simplest of these is the hollow-fiber reactor. This device is a mass-transfer analog ofthe shell-and-tube heat exchanger in which the tubes are made of semipermeable mem-branes. Typically, cells are inoculated on the shell side and are allowed to grow in place.The nutrient solution is pumped through the insides of the tubes. Nutrients diffuse throughthe membrane and are utilized by the cells, and metabolic products diffuse back into theflowing nutrient stream. Owing to diffusional limitations, the unmodified hollow-fiberunit does not perform well with living cells. Modifications involving multiple membranetypes (for example, for gas exchange or extractive product removal) or changes to pro-mote convective flux within the cell layer have been proposed. Several commercial reac-tors for animal cell cultivation use membrane entrapment. In addition to entrapment or encapsulation, cells can be bound directly to a support. Immobilization of cells on the surfaces of support materials can be achieved by physicaladsorption or covalent binding. Adsorption of cells on inert support surfaces has been widely used for cell immobi- lization. The major advantage of immobilization by adsorption is direct contact betweennutrient and support materials. High cell loadings can be obtained using microporous sup-port materials. However, porous support materials may cause intraparticle pore diffusionlimitations at high cell densities, as is also the case with polymer-entrapped cell systems.Also, the control of microenvironmental conditions is a problem with porous support ma-terials. A ratio of pore to cell diameter of 4 to 5 is recommended for the immobilization ofcells onto the inner surface of porous support particles. At small pore sizes, accessibilityof the nutrient into inner surfaces of pores may be the limiting factor, whereas at largepore sizes the specific surface area may be the limiting factor. Therefore, there may be anoptimal pore size, resulting in the maximum rate of bioconversion. Adsorption capacity and strength of binding are the two major factors that affect the selection of a suitable support material. Adsorption capacity varies between 2 mg/g(porous silica) and 250 mg/g (wood chips). Porous glass carriers provide adsorption ca-pacities (10 8to 109cells/g) that are less than or comparable to those of gel-entrapped cell concentrations (109to 1011cells/ml). The binding forces between the cell and support sur- faces may vary, depending on the surface properties of the support material and the typeof cells. Electrostatic forces are dominant when positively charged support surfaces (ion-exchange resins, gelatin) are used. Cells also adhere on negatively charged surfaces by co-valent binding or H bonding. The adsorption of cells on neutral polymer support surfaces Sec. 9.4 Immobilized Cell Systems 265ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 265may be mediated by chemical bonding, such as covalent bonding, H bonds, or van der Waals forces. Some specific chelating agents may be used to develop stronger cell-surfaceinteractions. Among the support materials used for cell adsorption are porous glass,porous silica, alumina, ceramics, (DEAE-Sephadex, CMC-), and Sepharose. Adsorption is inexpensive method of cell immobilization. However, lim- ited cell loadings and rather weak binding forces reduce the attractiveness of this method.Hydrodynamic shear around adsorbed cells should be very mild to avoid the removal ofcells from support surfaces. Covalent binding is the most widely used method for enzyme immobilization. How- ever, it is not as widely used for cell immobilization. Functional groups on cell and sup-port material surfaces are not usually suitable for covalent binding. Binding surfaces needto be specially treated with coupling agents (e.g., glutaraldehyde or carbodiimide) or reac-tive groups for covalent binding. These reactive groups may be toxic to cells. A number ofinorganic carriers (metal oxides such as titanium and zirconium oxide) have been devel-oped that provide satisfactory functional groups for covalent binding. Covalent binding forces are stronger than adsorption forces, resulting in more stable binding. However, with growing cells, large numbers of cell progeny must be lost. Sup-port materials with desired functional groups are rather limited. Among the support mate-rials used for covalent binding are CMC plus materials with \u2014OH groups are treated with CNBr, materials with \u2014NH 2are treated with glutaraldehyde, and supports with COOH groups are treated with carbodiimide for covalent binding with protein groups on cell surfaces. The direct cross-linking of cells by glutaraldehyde to form an insoluble aggregate is more like cell entrapment than binding. However, some cells may be cross-linked afteradsorption onto support surfaces. Cross-linking by glutaraldehyde may adversely affectthe cell's metabolic activity and may also cause severe diffusion limitations. Physicalcross-linking may also be provided by using polyelectrolytes, polymers such as chitosan,and salts [CaCl 2,Al(OH)3,FeCl3]. Direct cross-linking is not widely used because of the aforementioned disadvantages. A good support material should be rigid and chemically inert, should bind cells firmly, and should have high loading capacity. In the case of gel entrapment, gels shouldbe porous enough and particle size should be small enough to avoid intraparticle diffusionlimitations. Some examples of cell immobilization by entrapment and by surface attachment (binding) are summarized in Tables 9.1 and 9.2, respectively. 9.4.3. Passive Immobilization: Biological Films Biological films are the multilayer growth of cells on solid support surfaces. The support material can be inert or biologically active. Biofilm formation is common in natural andindustrial fermentation systems, such as biological waste-water treatment and mold fer-mentations. The interaction among cells and the binding forces between the cell and sup-port material may be very complicated. 266 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 266In mixed-culture microbial presence of some polymer-producing organ- isms facilitates biofilm formation and enhances the stability of the biofilms. Microenvi-ronmental conditions inside a thick biofilm vary with position and affect the physiologyof the cells. In a stagnant biological film, nutrients diffuse into the biofilm and products diffuse out into liquid nutrient medium. Nutrient and product profiles within the biofilm are im-portant factors affecting cellular physiology and metabolism. A schematic of a biofilm isdepicted in Fig. 9.11. Biofilm cultures have almost the same advantages as those of theimmobilized cell systems over suspension cultures, as listed in the previous section. The thickness of a biofilm is an important factor affecting the performance of the bi- otic phase. Thin biofilms will have low rates of conversion due to low biomass concentra-tion, and thick biofilms may experience diffusionally limited growth, which may or maynot be beneficial depending on the cellular system and objectives. Nutrient-depleted re-gions may also develop within the biofilm for thick biofilms. In many cases, an optimalbiofilm thickness resulting in the maximum rate of bioconversion exists and can be deter-mined. In some cases, growth under diffusion limitations may result in higher yields ofproducts as a result of changes in cell physiology and cell-cell interactions. In this case, Sec. 9.4 Immobilized Cell Systems 267TABLE 9.1 Examples of Cell Immobilization by Entrapment Using Different Support Materials Cells Support matrix Conversion S. cerevisiae k-Carrageenan or polyacrylamide Glucose to ethanol E. aerogenes k-Carrageenan to 2,3-butanediol mobilis Ca-alginate Polyurethane Conversion Penicillin G-APA menthol TABLE 9.2 Examples of Cell Immobilization by Surface Attachment Cells Support surface Conversion Lactobacillus sp. Gelatin (adsorption) Glucose to lactic acid Clostridium Page 267improvement in reaction stoichiometry (e.g., high yield) may overcome the reduction in reaction rate, and it may be more beneficial to operate the system under diffusion limita-tions. Usually, the most sparingly soluble nutrient, such as dissolved oxygen, is therate-limiting nutrient within the biofilm. A typical variation of dissolved oxygen concen-tration within the biofilm is depicted in Fig. 9.12. 9.4.4. Diffusional Limitations in Immobilized Cell Systems Immobilization of cells may cause extra diffusional limitations as compared to suspension cultures. The presence and significance of diffusional limitations depend on the relativerates of bioconversion and diffusion, which can be described by the Damk\u00f6hler number(Da) (see eq. 3.52 also). 268 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9 Figure 9.11 Schematic representation of a biofilm.

When the film-theory model applies,D e/dis the mass transfer coefficient (i.e., kL=De/d). If Da >>1, the rate of bioconversion is diffusion limited; for Da <<1, the rate is limited by the rate of bioconversion; and for Da \u00aa1, the diffusion and bioreaction rates are comparable. It is desirable to keep Da <1 to eliminate diffusion limitations when the productivity of a cell population does not improve upon immobilization due to cell-cellcontact and nutrient gradients. Diffusional limitations may be external (that is, between fluid and support surface in adsorption and covalent binding), intraparticle (i.e., inside particles in entrapment, encap-sulation, or immobilization in porous particles), or both. If the external mass transfer islimiting, an increase in liquid-phase turbulence should result in an increase in the reactionrate. In case of intraparticle mass-transfer limitations, a reduction in particle size or an in-crease in the porous void fraction of the support material should result in an increase inthe rate of the bioreaction. In Chapter 3 we discussed in reasonable detail a mathematical model of the interac- tion of diffusion and reaction for surface immobilized or entrapped biocatalysts. Thesemodels apply directly to immobilized cells when the kinetics of bioconversion are de-scribed by a Michaelis-Menten type of kinetic expression. Thus, the reader may wish toconsult Chapter 3 again. Another interesting case is to consider biofilms where we allow cell growth. Models for immobilized enzymes have no terms for biocatalyst replication, so this case presents anew problem. The thickness of a biofilm or the size of microbial floc increases with time during the growth phase. A microbial floc is an aggregation of many cells, and in some processes these aggregates can be more than 1 mm in diameter. However, since the rate of increasein biofilm thickness is much slower than the rate of substrate uptake, the system can beassumed to be at quasi-steady state for relatively short periods. The simplest case is toassume that the system is at quasi-steady state and all the cells inside the biofilm are in the same physiological state. In this situation we write a steady-state substrate bal-ance within the biofilm by using average kinetic constants for the biotic phase (livingcells). A differential material balance for the rate-limiting substrate within the biofilm (see Fig. 9.11) yields at steady state (9.49) where D eis the effective diffusivity (cm2/S) and YX/Sis ) d0 Sec. 9.4 Immobilized Cell Systems 269ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 269The boundary conditions are where Lis the thickness of biofilm. If it is also assumed that the liquid nutrient phase is vigorously agitated and the liq- uid film resistance is negligible, then S0\u00aaS0i. By defining a maximum rate of substrate utilization as rm=mmX/YX/S(g subs/cm3h), we rewrite eq. 9.49 as (9.50) In dimensionless form, eq. 9.50 can be written as (9.51) where and (9.52) Equation 9.51 can be solved numerically. An analytical solution can be derived for the limiting cases of zero or first-order reaction rates. The maximum rate of substrate flux in the absence of diffusion limitations is given by the following equation: (9.53) where Asis a surface area of biofilm available for substrate flux, Nsis the substrate flux, and Lis the thickness of the biofilm. In the presence of diffusion limitation, the rate of substrate consumption or flux is expressed in terms of the effectiveness factor. (9.54) where his the effectiveness factor, defined as the ratio of the rate of substrate consump- tion in the presence of diffusion limitation to the rate of substrate consumption in the ab-sence of diffusion limitation. In the absence of diffusion limitations, h@ 1, and in the presence of diffusion limitations, h<1. The effectiveness factor is a function of fand b.

Bioreactor Considerations in Immobilized Cell Systems Various reactor configurations can be used for immobilized cell systems. Since the sup- port matrices used for cell immobilization are often bioreactors withlow hydrodynamic shear, such packed-column, fluidized-bed, or airlift reactors, arepreferred. Mechanically agitated fermenters can be used for some immobilized-cell sys-tems if the support matrix is strong and durable. Any of these reactors can usually be op-erated in a perfusion mode by passing nutrient solution through a column Schematic diagrams packed-column and fluidized-bed reactorsare depicted in Fig. 9.15. These reactors can be operated in batch or continuous mode. Consider the reactors shown in Fig. 9.15. When the fluid recirculation rate is high, the system approaches CFSTR behavior. One commercial fluidized-bed, immobilized-animal-cell bioreactor system requires high recirculation to maintain uniform conditionsin the reactor. The models we have discussed so far can be applied to such systems. Theh= - Systems 273ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 273other extreme involves some waste-treatment systems where the rate of fluid recirculation is low or even zero. In the latter case, the system cannot be modeled as a CFSTR but mustbe treated as a PFR. To analyze such a system, consider a material balance on the rate-limiting substrate over a differential element: (9.69) where S 0is the bulk liquid-phase substrate concentration (mg S/cm3) and is a function of height, Fis the liquid nutrient flow rate (cm3/h), Nsis flux of substrate into the biofilm (mg S/cm2h), ais the biofilm or support particle surface area per unit reactor volume (cm2/cm3), Ais the cross-sectional area of the bed (cm2), and dzis the differential height of an element of the column (cm). Substituting eq. 9.54 into eq. 9.69 yields the followingequation: (9.70) Integration of eq. 9.70 yields (9.71) where S 0iis the inlet bulk substrate concentration, Lis the biofilm thickness or the charac- teristic length of the support particle ( L= VP/AP), and His the total height 274 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9 Figure 9.15. Schematics of a packed-bed and a fluidized-bed biofilm or immobilized- cell bioreactors are shown. In batch operation, only the streams with solid lines exist. Incontinuous operation, the streams shown by dashed lines are added. For the fluidized bed,fluidization can be accomplished by liquid recirculation only or a mixture of liquid andgas flows.ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 274For low substrate concentrations in the feed, the rate of substrate consumption is first order and eq. 9.71 has the following form: (9.72) Substrate concentration drops exponentially with the height of the column in this case, and a plot of ln S0versus Hresults in a straight line. Equation 9.71 or 9.72 can be used as the design equation for immobilized-biofilm column reactors to determine the height ofthe column for a desired level of substrate conversion. Example 9.4 Glucose is converted to ethanol by immobilized S. cerevisiae cells entrapped in Ca-alginate beads in a packed column. The specific rate of ethanol production is qP=0.2 g ethanol/ g cell h, and the average dry-weight cell concentration in the bed is -X=25 g/l bed. Assume that growth is negligible (i.e., almost all glucose is converted to ethanol) and the bead size issufficiently small that h@1. The feed flow rate is F=400 l/h, and glucose concentration in the feed is S 0i=100 g glucose/l.

Substituting the given values into 202 2 5 04 941 0 400 49 4 92 -= ==pH H dm at low moisture lev- els or water activities. The water content of a typical submerged fermentation is more than95%. The water content of a solid mash in SSF often varies between 40% and 80%.Solid-state fermentations are usually used for the fermentation of agricultural products orfoods, such as rice, wheat, barley, corn, and soybeans. The unique characteristic ofsolid-state fermentations is operation at low moisture levels, which provides a selectiveenvironment for the growth of mycelial organisms, such as molds. In fact, most solid-statefermentations are mold fermentations producing extracellular enzymes on moist agricul-tural substrates. Since bacteria and yeasts cannot tolerate low moisture levels (water activ-ities), the chances of contamination of fermentation media by bacteria or yeast are greatlyreduced in SSF. Although most SSFs are mold fermentations, SSFs based on bacteria andyeast operating at relatively high moisture levels (75% to 90%) are also used. Solid-statefermentations are used widely in Asia for food products, such as tempeh, miso, or soysauce fermentations, and also for enzyme production. The major advantages of SSFs over submerged fermentation systems are (1) the small volume of fermentation mash or reactor volume, resulting in lower capital and oper-ating costs, (2) a lower chance of contamination due to low moisture levels, (3) easy prod-uct separation, (4) energy efficiency, and (5) the allowing of the development of fullydifferentiated structures, which is critical in some cases to product formation. The majordisadvantage of SSFs is the heterogeneous nature of the media due to poor mixing charac-teristics, which results in control problems (pH, DO, temperature) within the fermentationmash. To eliminate these control problems, fermentation media are usually mixed eithercontinuously or intermittently. For large fermentation mash volumes, the concentrationgradients may not be eliminated at low agitation speeds, and mycelial cells may be dam-aged at high agitation speeds. Usually, a rotating-drum fermenter is used for SSF systems,and the rotational speed needs to be optimized for the best performance. Solid-substrate fermentations imply a more general method of fermentations in which moisture content may not need to be low, but the substrate is in the form of sub-merged solid particles in liquid media. Bacterial ore leaching (i.e., growth and microbialoxidation on surfaces of mineral sulfide particles) or fermentation of rice in a packedcolumn with circulating liquid media are examples of solid-substrate fermentations.Solid-state (or solid-phase) fermentations are a special form of solid-substrate fermenta-tions for which the substrate is solid and the moisture level is low. The koji process is an SSF system that employs molds ( Aspergillus, Rhizopus ) growing on grains or foods (wheat, rice, soybean). A typical SSF process involves twostages. The first and the primary stage is an aerobic, fungal, solid-state fermentation ofgrains called the koji. The second stage is an anaerobic submerged fermentation with a mixed bacterial culture called the moromi . The products listed in Table 9.3 are the prod- ucts of aerobic SSF, the koji process. Fermentation in the second stage (moromi) may berealized by using the natural flora, or, usually, with externally added bacteria and yeasts.Some strains of Saccharomyces , Torulopsis , and Pediococcus are used as flavor producers in soy sauce manufacture. The moromi is usually fermented for 8 to 12 months. However,the processing time can be reduced to 6 months by temperature profiling. The final prod-uct is pressed to recover the liquid soy sauce and is pasteurized, filtered, and bottled. 276 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9ch09 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 276The major industrial use of the koji process is for the production of enzymes by fungal species. Fungal amylases are produced by SSF of wheat bran by A. oryzae in a rotating-drum fermenter. Wheat bran is pretreated with formaldehyde, and the initial pHof the bran is adjusted to pH =3.5 to 4.0 to reduce the chance of contamination. Usually, perforated pans, rotating drums, or packed beds with air ventilation are used. A typicalrotary-drum type of koji fermenter is depicted in Fig. 9.16. Enzymes other than amylases,such as cellulase, pectinase, protease, and by koji fermenta-tions. Trichoderma viride species have been used for the production of cellulases from wheat bran in a rotary-tray fermenter. Some secondary metabolites, such as antibacterial agents, are produced by Rhizopus and Actinomucor species in some koji processes. Certain mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, were produced by SSF of rice (40% moisture) by A. parasiticus . Ochratoxins were also produced by Aspergillus species on wheat in a rotary-drum koji fermenter. Microbial degradation of lignocellulosics can also be accomplished by solid-state fermentations forwaste-treatment purposes or in biopulping of wood chips for use in paper manufacture.Spores from some molds have found use as insecticides. Proper spore formation is diffi-cult to obtain in submerged culture, and SSF must be used. Major process variables in SSF systems are moisture content (water activity), inocu- lum density, temperature, pH, particle size, and aeration/agitation. Optimization of theseparameters to maximize product yield and rate of product formation is the key in SSFsystems and depends on the substrate and organism used. Most natural substrates (e.g., grains) require pretreatment to make the physical structure of substrates more sus-ceptible to mycelial penetration and utilization. Solid substrates are usually treated withantimicrobial agents, such as formaldehyde, and are steamed in an autoclave. Nutrientmedia addition, pH adjustment, and the adjustment of moisture level are realized beforeinoculation of the fermentation mash. Koji fermentations are usually realized in acontrolled-humidity air environment with air ventilation and agitation. Many solid-statemycelial fermentations are shear sensitive due to disruption of the mycelia at high Sec. 9.5 Solid-State Fermentations 277TABLE 9.3 Some Traditional Food Fermentations Thermal processing Incubation Initial Primary Common Temp.

At low agitation rates, oxygen transfer and CO2evolution rates become limiting. Therefore, an optimal range of agitation rate or rotation speed needs to be determined. Similarly, there is a minimum level of moisture content ( 30%by weight) below which microbial activity is inhibited. At high moisture levels ( >60%), solid sub- strates become sticky and form large aggregates. Moreover, moisture level affects themetabolic activities of cells. Optimal moisture level needs to be determined experimen-tally for each cell-substrate system. For most of the koji processes, the optimal moisturelevel is about 40 %\u00b1 5%. Particle size should be small enough to avoid any oxygen-CO 2 exchange or other nutrient transport limitations. Porosity of the particles can be improvedby pretreatment to provide a larger intraparticle surface to volume ratio for microbialaction. Most of the SSF processes are realized using a rotary-tray type of reactor in a tem- perature- and humidity-controlled chamber where controlled-humidity air is circulatedthrough stacked beds of trays containing fermented arotary-tray are less fre-quently because of the shear sensitivity of mycelial cells. 9.6. SUMMARY Bioreactors using suspended cells can be operated in many modes intermediate between abatch reactor and a single-stage chemostat. Although a chemostat has potential productiv-ity advantages for primary products, considerations of genetic instability, process flexibil-ity, and process reliability have greatly limited the use of chemostat units. The use of cellrecycle with a CSTR increases volumetric productivity and has found use in large- 278 Bioreactors for Suspension and Immobilized Cultures Chap. 9 Figure 9.16.

Multistage continuous systems improve the potential usefulness of continuousprocesses for the production of secondary metabolites and for the use of genetically unsta-ble cells. The fed-batch system is widely used in commercial plants and combines the fea-tures of continuous culture and batch that allow the manufacturer to maintain flexibilityand ease of intervention. The perfusion system is another option that is particularly attrac-tive for animal cells. Immobilized cell systems offer a number of potential processing advantages, and the commercialization of such systems is proceeding rapidly where cell culture is expen-sive and difficult (e.g., animal cell tissue culture). Physical entrapment or encapsulation isused in most cases, although adsorption onto surfaces or covalent binding of cells to sur-faces is possible. In some cases, self-immobilization on surfaces is possible and a biofilm is formed. Biofilm reactors can apply to tissue culture, mold, and bacterial systems. Biofilm-basedreactors are very important in waste-treatment applications and in natural ecosystems. Theanalysis of immobilized cell reactors is analogous to that for immobilized enzyme reac-tors except for the feature of biocatalyst replication. Solid-state fermentations share some characteristics with immobilized cell systems, but differ in that no discernible liquid is present. SSFs have found important uses in theproduction of some traditional fermented foods and may have use in upgrading agricul-tural or forest materials and in the production of mold products requiring full mold differ-entiation.

In a two-stage chemostat system, the volumes of the first and second reactors are V 1=500 l and V2=300 l, respectively. The first reactor is used for biomass production and the second is for a secondary metabolite formation. The feed flow rate to the first reactor is F =100 l/h, and the glucose concentration in the feed is S=5.0 g/l.

Penicillin is produced by P . chrysogenum in a fed-batch culture with the intermittent addition of glucose solution to the culture medium. The initial culture volume at quasi-steady state isV 0=500 l, and glucose-containing nutrient solution is added with a flow rate of F =50 l/h. Glucose concentration in the feed solution and initial cell concentration are S0=300 g/l and X0=20 g/l, respectively. The kinetic and yield coefficients of the organism are mm=0.2 h-1, KS=0.5 g/l, g dw/g glucose.ch09 281a.Determine the culture volume at t=10 h. b.Determine the concentration of glucose at t=10 h at quasi-steady state. c.Determine the concentration and total amount of cells at quasi-steady state when t=10 h. d.If qP=0.05 g product/g cells h and P0=0.1 g/l, determine the product concentration in the vessel at t=10 h. 9.5The bioconversion of glucose to ethanol is carried out in a packed-bed, immobilized-cell bioreactor containing yeast cells entrapped in Ca-alginate beads. The rate-limiting substrateis glucose, and its concentration in the feed bulk liquid phase is S 0i=5g/l. The nutrient flow rate is F=2 l/min. The particle size of Ca-alginate beads is DP=0.5 cm. The rate constants for this conversion are rm=100 mg S/cm3h KS=10 mg S/cm3 for the following rate expression: The surface area of the alginate beads per unit volume of the reactor is a=25 cm2/cm3, and the cross-sectional area of the bed is A =100 cm2. Assuming a first-order reaction-kinetics (e.g., relatively low substrate concentrations), determine the required bed height for 80 %con- version of glucose to ethanol at the exit stream. Hint: To calculate the effectiveness factor, we can use the following equations: where and DS=10-6cm2/s 9.6. A fluidized-bed, immobilized-cell bioreactor is used for the conversion of glucose to ethanol by Z. mobilis cells immobilized in k-carrageenan gel beads. The dimensions of the bed are 10 cm (diameter) by 200 cm. Since the reactor is fed from the bottom of the column and becauseof CO 2gas evolution, substrate and cell concentrations decrease with the height of the column. The average cell concentration at the bottom of the column is X0= 45 g/l, and the average cell concentration decreases with the column height according to the following equation: where Zis the column height (cm). The specific rate of substrate consumption is qS=2 g S/g cells h. The feed flow rate and glucose concentration in the feed are 5 l/h and 160 g glucose/l, respectively. a.Determine the substrate (glucose) concentration in the effluent. b.Determine the ethanol concentration in the effluent and ethanol productivity (g/l h) if YP/S =0.48 Suspension and Immobilized Cultures 10/11/01 5:33 PM Page 2829.7. In a fluidized-bed biofilm reactor, cells are attached on spherical plastic particles to form biofilms of average thickness L =0.5 mm. The bed is used to remove carbon compounds from a waste-water stream. The feed flow rate and concentration of total fermentable carboncompounds in the feed are F=2 l/h and S=2000 mg/l. The diameter of the column is 10 cm. The kinetic constants of the microbial population are r m=50 mg S/cm3h and KS=25 mg S/cm3. The specific surface area of the biofilm in the reactor is 2.5 cm2/cm3. Assuming first-order reaction kinetics and an average effectiveness factor of h=0.7 throughout the col- umn, determine the required height of the column for effluent total carbon concentration ofS 0i=100 mg/l. 9.8Glucose is converted to ethanol by immobilized yeast cells entrapped in gel beads. The spe- cific rate of ethanol production is: qP=0.2 g ethanol/g-cell-h. The effectiveness factor for an average bead is 0.8. Each bead contains 50 g/L of cells. The voids volume in the column is40%. Assume growth is negligible (all glucose is converted into ethanol). The feed flow rateis F=400 l/h and glucose concentration in the feed is S 0i=150 g glucose/l. The diameter of the column is 1 m and the yield coefficient is about 0.49 g ethanol/g glucose. The columnheight is 4 m. a.What is the glucose conversion at the exit of the column? b.What is the ethanol concentration in the exit stream? 9.9Consider the batch growth curve in Fig. 9.4 and the corresponding plots of dX/dt vs. Xand dP/dt vs. P.

INTRODUCTION In our previous discussion we focused on idealized descriptions of homogeneous bioreac- tors with regard to operating mode (batch, fed-batch, continuous, and multistage) andgeneralized discussions of heterogeneous reactors (immobilized-cell systems and SSF).However, real processes demand greater insight into the details of reactor configuration. Itwould be impossible in a book of this type to provide the reader with all the informationnecessary to become a design engineer. However, we will introduce some of the conceptsthat drive the choice of real bioreactors. Our focus will be primarily on reactors for bac-teria and fungi; some of the special reactor issues for animal and plant cell tissue culturewill be handled in chapters on tissue culture.ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 28510.2. SCALE-UP AND ITS DIFFICULTIES 10.2.1. IntroductionWhy would the performance of a fungal culture making an antibiotic be so different at 10,000 l than at 10 l? At first glance the reader may have difficulty understanding whyperformance should change with scale. The answers lie in the difficulty of maintaininghomogeneity in large systems, changes in surface to volume ratios, and changes in thecultures themselves due to the increased length of culture time. To understand the prob-lems in scale-up, we first need to describe what traditional culture vessels are and howthey are operated. 10.2.2. Overview of Reactor T ypes Rather than catalog the large array of suggested fermenter and bioreactor designs, we will restrict ourselves to considering some basic types: 1.Reactors with internal mechanical agitation. 2.Bubble columns , which rely on gas sparging for agitation. 3.Loop reactors, in which mixing and liquid circulation are induced by the motion of an injected gas, by a mechanical pump, or by a combination of the two. All three reactor types (see Fig. 10.1 for schematics) invariably are concerned with three-phase reactions (gas-liquid-solid). Three-phase reactors are difficult to design, be-cause the mass transfer of components among the three phases must be controlled. Inade-quate tools for the complex fluid mechanics in such systems coupled with the complexnature of cells as reactive solids make the prediction of system performance from firstprinciples very difficult. The traditional fermenter is the stirred-tank reactor (Fig. 10.2), the prime example of a reactor with internal mechanical agitation. The main virtues of such systems are thatthey are highly flexible and can provide high k La(volumetric mass-transfer coefficient) values for gas transfer. Stirred reactors of up to 400 m3are used in antibiotic production, with stirrer powers of up to 5 kW/m3. Stirred reactors can be used commercially up to vis- cosities of about 2000 centipoises (2 Pa sec). Gas under pressure is supplied to the sparger (usually either a ring with holes or a tube with a single orifice). The size of the gas bubbles and their dispersion throughout thetank are critical to reactor performance. Although a sparging ring will initially providesmaller bubble size and better gas distribution, spargers with a single discharge point areoften preferred for media with high levels of suspended solids because they are more re-sistant to plugging. Gas dispersion is mainly the function not of the sparger but of the impeller . The im- peller must provide sufficiently rapid agitation to disperse bubbles throughout the tank, toincrease their residence time within the liquid, and to shear larger bubbles into small bub-bles. Too much stirring can be detrimental, owing to the shear sensitivity exhibited tovarying degrees by some cells (e.g., animal cells) and the stratification of reactor contents 286 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control Bioreactors Chap. 10ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 286with multiple-impeller systems. Although a wide variety of impeller designs have been proposed, the predominant choices are disc- and turbine-type impellers, while marine andpaddle impellers are of particular interest for cellular systems with high levels of shearsensitivity. The Rushton impeller (Fig. 10.3) is a disc with typically 6 to 8 blades designed to pump fluid in a radial direction. This was the predominant impeller design up to themid-1980s and is commonly found on industrial and laboratory fermenters. The axial flowhydrofoil impellers (Fig. 10.3) have become increasingly popular. These axial flow sys-tems can pump liquid either down or up. They have been shown to give superior perfor-mance (compared to Rushton radial flow impellers) with respect to lower energy demandsfor the same level of oxygen transfer. Further, they show reduced maximum shear rates, Sec. 10.2 Scale-up and Its Difficulties 287 Figure 10.1. Bioreactor types.

Axial flow systemsbreak up the compartmentalization often observed with multiple radial flow impellers onthe same shaft. Combinations of axial flow and radial flow impeller systems are some-times used. To augment mixing and gas dispersion, baffles are employed. A typicalarrangement includes four baffles, the width of each being about 8 %to 10 %of the reactor 288 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10 Figure 10.2.

The input air can be sterilized by both incineration and filtra-tion. (With permission, from W. Crueger and A. Crueger, Biotechnology: A Textbook of animal cell cultures, baffles cause shear damage; instead of baffles bottom- drive axial impellers slightly offset from center are used. The vessel itself is almost always stainless steel. Type 316 is used on all wetted parts, type 304 on covers and jackets. With plant and animal cell tissue cultures, alow-carbon version (type 316L) is often used. Many bench-scale fermenters are glass ves-sels with stainless-steel cover plates. Glass fermenters are rarely used at the 50 l scale, andmaterial considerations limit the maximum size of glass vessels to about 500 l. The use ofstainless steel and glass is called for by the need to sterilize the reactor and the corrosiveand/or abrasive nature of many fermentation media. Sec. 10.2 Scale-up and Its Difficulties 289 Figure 10.2 (continued)ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 289Most fermenters are built with a height-to-diameter ratio of 2 to 3, although bioreac- tors for animal cell cultures tend to be closer to 1. The Rushton impeller diameter is typi-cally 30 %to 40 %of the tank diameter, while it may reach 50 %with the axial flow hydroflow impellers. In large reactors the two main limitations on size are the abilities ofthe design to provide an adequate supply of oxygen and to remove metabolic heat effi-ciently. Large reactors usually use either internal coils for heat removal or a jacketed ves-sel. Although copper coils have better thermal transport characteristics, stainless-steelcoils are almost always used, although this choice can depend on the nature of the mediaand culture. Internal coils provide advantages over jacketed vessels in terms of efficiencyof heat removal, owing to the larger surface area for heat transfer. However, in many sys-tems the coils become rapidly fouled by microbial growth, decreasing heat transfer andoften adversely affecting mixing. In such cases the jacketed vessel offers advantages. Another problem often encountered in commercial fermentations is foaming . If foam escapes from the fermenter, it can wet filters, increasing pressure drop and decreas-ing gas flow. Of greater concern is that it provides a pathway for contaminating cells toenter the fermenter. For most products of commercial interest, absolute sterility is re-quired, and contamination may cause the loss of much product, time, and money. Foamcan be controlled with a mechanical foam breaker or the addition of surface-active chemi-cal agents. Although such chemicals can be very effective in controlling foam, there arepenalties. Foam-breaking chemicals usually lower k Lavalues, reducing the reactor's ca- pacity to supply oxygen or other gases, and in some cases they can be inhibitory to cellgrowth. Foam formation is not well understood, but complex media or the formation ofhigh levels of extracellular polymers (e.g., proteins) tend to promote foaming. Foam canlimit the ultimate productivity of a fermenter. All stirred-tank fermenters provide headspace for the gas to disengage from the liquid. The working volume (the amount of cul- ture) in a fermenter is typically about 75 %of the total fermenter volume. 290 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10 Figure 10.3. Liquid flow in bottled tanks with (A) Rushton radial flow impellers andwith 5:38 PM Page 290Sterility is a prime design consideration for fermenter hardware. Pressurized steam is used for in-place sterilization of the reactor, seals, probes, and valves. The number ofopenings into the fermenter should be limited to what is essential. A trade-off is necessarybetween the use of many probes, which improves fermenter control, and of few probes,which improves the chances of maintaining sterility. Small openings are made leakproofwith O-rings, while flat gaskets are satisfactory for larger openings. Although smallfermenters can use magnetically coupled agitators, industrial-size fermenters have movingshafts that must penetrate into the fermenter. Prevention of contamination due to the entryof foreign organisms through such a shaft is a major challenge in the mechanical design offermenters. Stuffing-box seals are common on old fermenters, while double mechanicalseals are used in newer ones. All surfaces must be smooth. Crevices in the tank surface,pipes, and valves can trap large quantities of particulate organics and contaminatingorganisms. Such clumps of cells increase the chances for a contaminant to survive thesterilization procedure. Cleanability of all surfaces is important. Cleaning is generally done \"in place,\" and fermenter design includes spray balls to allow for clean-in-place (CIP) technology. Highly alkaline detergents are often used, andthis factor helps dictate the selection of materials. Surfaces, especially in bioreactors foranimal or plant tissue cultures, often undergo electropolishing, an electrolytic process thatremoves the sharp microscopic projections often resulting from mechanical polishing.All ports and valves involved in sampling and injection should be protected with steam-sterilizable closures. The application of a continuous flow of live steam to sample valvesis one strategy that is often applied in antibiotic plants. The same concern for sterility applies to bubble columns and loop (e.g., airlift) reac- tors. Bubble columns offer distinct advantages for some systems. They are suitable forlow-viscosity Newtonian broths; satisfactory mixing may not be possible in highly vis-cous broths. Bubble columns provide a higher energy efficiency than stirred-tank systems,where by energy efficiency we mean the amount of oxygen transferred per unit of power input. An additional advantage often mentioned for bubble columns is that they provide alow-shear environment, which may be a critical consideration with some cells. Cells tendto accumulate at the bubble surface, however, and bubble bursting is highly detrimental tocells. The absence of mechanical agitation also reduces cost and eliminates one potentialentry point for contaminants. Besides having less vigorous mixing capabilities than stirred tanks, bubble column operation is often limited by considerations of foaming and bubble coalescence. Becauseof bubble coalescence, bubble columns work over a rather narrow range of gas flow rates.The range of appropriate gas flows varies with the nature of the broth. Thus, bubblecolumns are less flexible than stirred tanks. Partial relief from the problem of coalescencecan be found by using multistage columns; each stage (perforated plate) acts to redistrib-ute gas flow. This gas redispersion, however, carries an energy penalty. Loop reactors have intermediate characteristics between bubble columns and stirred tanks. We will consider primarily the airlift system (Fig. 10.1). Here the motion of the gas carries fluid and cells up a draft tube. At the top, gas disengages from the liquid, and the de-gassed liquid (which is denser than the gassed liquid) descends in the annulus outside thetube. At the bottom of the reactor, the descending fluid again encounters the gas stream andis carried back up the draft tube. Airlift systems can generally handle somewhat more vis-cous fluids than bubble columns, and coalescence is not so much of a problem.

With very large fermenters ( > 200 m3) the use of nonmechanically agitated designs is preferred, as high oxygen transfer rates and better cooling can be attained. Withan airlift design the interchange of material between fluid elements is small, so the transienttime to circulate from the bottom of the draft tube to the top and back again is important. Inthe ICI design, multiple injection points for the substrate were used to prevent the cells frombecoming substrate starved during circulation. The addition of mechanical stirring to a loopreactor increases flexibility (the operating range). Although we focus our attention on agitated tanks, the reader should realize that most fermentations (in terms of total volume) are conducted in nonstirred and nonaeratedvessels. Such vessels are used often in food fermentations, such as for beer, wine, anddairy products (e.g., cheese). In anaerobic fermentations, gas evolution by the fermentingorganisms can provide some mixing, but gases are not normally sparged into the vessel.However, agitated and/or aerated vessels are used on a wider variety of fermentations (interms of number of processes), are more difficult to scale, and are more likely to be cho-sen for the production of new products. 10.2.3. Some Considerations in Aeration, Agitation, and Heat T ransfer The basic equations describing oxygen transfer, carbon dioxide evolution, and heat gener- ation by microbial growth are given in Chapter 6. For industrial-scale fermenters, oxygensupply and heat removal are the key design limitations. The severity of the oxygen requirements depends on the choice of organism. Equa- tion 6.24 can be rewritten as (10.1) where q O2is the specific uptake rate of oxygen (mol O2/g-h). Typical values of qO2are given in Table 10.1. The value of qO2(or OUR or oxygen uptake rate) is the demand side of the equation; typical requirements in large-scale systems are 40 to 200 mmol O2/l-h, with most systems in the 40- to 60-mmol O2/l-h range. On the supply side, the critical parameter is kLa(h-1), the volumetric transfer coeffi- cient. A wide range of equations has been suggested for the estimation of kLa. References at the end of this chapter detail some of these correlations. A typical correlation is of theform (10.2a) where kis an empirical constant, P gis the power requirement in an aerated (gassed) biore- actor, VRis bioreactor volume, vSis the superficial gas exit speed, and Nis the rotational speed of the agitator. With equations of the form of 10.2a, all the parameters must be inthe units used in fitting the equation to a data set. An example of one of the original corre-lations of this type (when partial pressures are used) is (10.2b) ka P V h p v NLg R S (mmol/ l-h-atm) l cm/min) ] / ] ( [ (.0 6 100004ka =(/ a C 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 292A value of Pgcan be estimated from other correlations, such as (10.3) where Kis a constant based on reactor geometry, Puis the power required in the ungassed fermenter, Diis the impeller diameter, and Qis the aeration rate (volume of gas supplied per minute divided by the liquid volume in the reactor). The preceding correlations are not very good for Newtonian systems and are even worse for non-Newtonian or highly viscous systems. They also neglect the effects ofmedium components on k La. The presence of salts and surfactants can significantly alter bubble size and liquid film resistance around the gas bubble. These factors also can affectoxygen solubility (C*). Temperature and pressure also affect k Laand C*. Finally, on the supply side, it should be noted that CLis maintained at a value above the critical oxygen concentration (see Chapter 6) but at a low enough value to provide good oxygen transfer.For many bacterial fermentations, a C Lof about 1 mg/l provides a good margin of safety if mixing is incomplete and yet allows a good rate of oxygen transfer. Although kLais difficult to predict, it is a measurable parameter. Four approaches are commonly used: unsteady state, steady state, dynamic, and sulfite test. The way inwhich these methods are applied depends on whether the test is being made on the systemin the presence or absence of cells. A new reactor prior to operation can be filled with pure water or a medium in which C* can be accurately measured. Oxygen is removed from the system by sparging with N Its Difficulties 293TABLE 10.1 Typical Respiration Rates of Microbes and Cells in Culture qO2 Organism (mmol O2/g dw-h) Penicillium 3-4 Aspergillus niger ca. 3 Plant cells Acer pseudoplatanus (sycamore) 0.2 Saccharum (sugar cane) 1-3 Animal unsteady-state method , air is then introduced and the change in dissolved oxygen (DO) is monitored until the solution is nearly saturated. In this case, (10.4a) or (10.4b) or (10.5) As shown in Fig. 10.4, a plot of log ( C* -CL) versus time will give an estimate of kLa. Another approach is the sulfite method . In the presence of Cu2+, the sulfur in sulfite (SO2- 3) is oxidized to sulfate (SO2- 4) in a zero-order reaction. This reaction is very rapid, and consequently CLapproaches zero. The rate of sulfate formation is monitored and is proportional to the rate of oxygen consumption ( /onenumeratorcentered/twodenominatorcenteredmol of O2is consumed to produce 1 CC Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10 Figure 10.4.

The factor, /onenumeratorcentered/twodenominatorcentered, requires that CSO4and C* be ex- pressed in terms of moles. Oxygen solubility, C*, is a constant dependent on medium composition, temperature, and pressure and can be measured separately. Thus, (10.7) The sulfite method probably overestimates kLa. The astute reader may have already noted that if the chemical reaction takes place in the liquid film around the gas bubble, theapparent oxygen transfer will be greater than that for a system with no chemical reactionin the liquid film. (An unresolved question is whether respiring organisms can enhanceoxygen transfer by a similar method.) Perhaps the best way to determine k Lais the steady-state method, in which the whole reactor is used as a respirometer. Such an approach requires the accurate measure-ment of oxygen concentration in all gas exit streams and a reliable measurement of C L. A mass balance on O2in the gas allows the rate of O2uptake, OUR, to be calculated: (10.8) OUR could also be estimated with off-line measurements of a sample of the culture in a respirometer, but using information from the actual fermenter is ideal. One complication,however, in this (and other methods) is the value of C* to use. In a large fermenter, gas is sparged under significant pressure (due at least to the liquid height in an industrial fer-menter). C* is proportional to pO 2, which depends on total pressure as well as the fraction of the gas that is oxygen. At the sparger point, pO2will be significantly higher than at the exit, due to both higher pressure and the decrease in the fraction of the gas that is O2be- cause of consumption by respiration. In a bubble column, the log mean value of C* based on pO2at the entrance and exit would be a justifiable choice. In a perfectly mixed vessel, the composition of gas in the exit stream should be the same as bubbles dispersed any-where in the tank, and consequently C* would be based on pO 2at the exit. In an actual tank, a knowledge of the residence time distribution of gas bubbles is necessary to esti-mate a volume averaged value of C*. The dynamic method shares similarities with the steady-state method in that it uses a fermenter with active cells. It is simpler in that it requires only a dissolved oxygen (DO)probe and a chart recorder rather than off-gas analyzers as well as the DO probe requiredin the steady-state method. The governing equation for DO levels is: (10.9a) or (10.9b) The dynamic method requires that the air supply be shut off for a short period (eq < 5 min) and then turned back on. The anticipated result is shown in Fig. 10.5. Since there areno gas bubbles when the gas is off, k Lawill be zero. Hence,dC dt k a C C and Its Difficulties 295ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 295(10.10) and the slope of the descending curve will give the OUR or -qO2X. The lowest value of CL obtained in the experiment must be above the critical oxygen concentration (recall Chap- ter 6) so that qO2is independent of CL. Further complications can arise due to the measure- ment lag in the DO probe (about 30 to 45 s) and the dissolution of oxygen from theheadspace gas into the liquid (which may be significant primarily in small vessels, sincethe ratio of surface area for gas transfer is high compared to liquid volume). When airsparging is resumed, the ascending curve can be used to calculate k La. Values of dCL/dt can be estimated from the slope of the ascending curve calculated at various timepoints. A plot of ( dC L/dt+ OUR) versus ( C*- CL) results in a line with a slope of kLa. The primary advantage of the dynamic method is that kLacan be estimated under actual fermentation conditions. Additionally, if qO2is known, the value of OUR can be used to estimate X. Variations on these methods to determine kLaexist, but the general principles re- main the same. However, once the OTR (oxygen transfer rate) can be estimated fromeither correlations or experimentally determined values k La, it is possible to quickly esti- mate the rate of metabolic heat generation. Equation 6.29 provides such a relationship.Equations 6.27 to 6.29 apply in all cases and lead to an estimate of the rate of heat genera-tion. The total amount of cooling surface (either jacket or coils) required can then be cal-culated, given the temperature of the cooling water, the maximum flow rates allowable,the desired temperature differential between the exiting coolant and the reactor, and theoverall heat transfer coefficient. The latter presents the greatest problem, since it can varygreatly from fermentation to fermentation.

Many fermentations will cause solids deposition on coils, greatly decreasing the heat transfer coefficient. In extremecases, solids deposition can plug spaces between coils, greatly decreasing convective flowby coils and consequently the heat transfer coefficient. Cooling coils are usually placed sothat high fluid velocities will strike the coils to promote cleaning. If a reactor is to bemaintained as a highly flexible piece of equipment adaptable to a wide range of fermenta-tions, very conservative estimates of the overall heat transfer coefficient must be made. Example 10.1. Use the data in Fig 10.5 to estimate kLafrom the dynamic method. Also, if the cell dry weight has been measured as 2 g/l, evaluate the specific respiration rate of the culture. Solution When the aerator is off, we can use the declining part of the curve in Fig 10.5 to estimate OUR. For the straight-line part of the curve (0.5 to 3 min after the aerator is off) weestimate OUR as To estimate k Lawe use the ascending curve formed during reaeration or The best method to estimate kLa is to plot dCL/dt +OUR versus ( C* -CL)-1, but you can just make use of single points at individual times. In this problem kLa=0.16 min-1. The specific respiration rate is estimated as or 10.2.4. Scale-up The discussion in the previous sections should have alerted the reader to the complex na- ture of industrial fermenters. Now we consider how these complexities affect approachesto scaling fermenters. Generally, fermenters maintain a height-to-diameter ratio of 2 to 1 or 3 to 1. If the height-to-diameter ratio remains constant, then the surface-to-volume ratio decreases dra-matically during scale-up. This change decreases the relative contribution of surface aera-tion to oxygen supply and dissolved-carbon-dioxide removal in comparison to thecontribution from sparging. For traditional bacterial fermentations, surface aeration isunimportant, but for shear-sensitive cultures (e.g., animal cells) it can be critical becauseof restrictions on stirring and sparging.qX q qO O O2 2 2OUR/ mg DO l- g cells / l mg DO g cells-= = =08 2 04. / min . / minOURO2=qXkadC CCLL 0.5 mg DO/l-25 05 10.2 and Its Difficulties 297ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 297More important in bacterial and fungal fermentations is wall growth . If cells adhere to surfaces, and if such adherent cells have altered metabolism (e.g., due to mass transferlimitations), then data obtained in a small fermenter may be unreliable in predicting cul-ture response in a larger fermenter. This point is more clearly illustrated in Example 10.2. Perhaps even more importantly, it can be shown that the physical conditions in a large fermenter can never exactly duplicate those in a smaller fermenter if geometric simi- larity is maintained. In the case described in Table 10.2, a stirred-tank diameter has been increased by a factor of 5, resulting in a 125-fold increase in volume, since the height-to-diameter ratio was maintained constant. Four cases are treated in Table 10.2: scale-upbased on constant power input ( P 0/V), constant liquid circulation rate inside the vessel (pumping rate of impeller per unit volume, Q/V), constant shear at impeller tip ( NDi), and Difixes all the quantities in Table 10.2. Since these quantities have different dependencies on Nand Di, a change of scale must result in changes in the physical environment that the cells experience. When these changes alterthe distribution of chemical species in the reactor, or they destroy or injure cells, the meta-bolic response of the culture will differ from one scale to another. In some cases cells re-spond to modest changes in mechanical stress by changing physiological functions evenwhen there is no visible cell injury or cell lysis. Thus, different scale-up rules (constantP/Vimplies constant OTR, constant Re implies geometrically similar flow patterns, con- stant Nto give constant mixing times, and constant tip speed to give constant shear) can give very different results. These scale-up problems are all related to transport processes. In particular, the relative time scales for mixing and reaction are important in determining the degree ofheterogeneity in a fermenter. As we scale up, we may move from a system where the mi-crokinetics (the cellular reactions) control the system response at small scale to one wheretransport limitations control the system response at large scale. When a change in the con-trolling regime takes place, the results of small-scale experiments become unreliable withrespect to predicting large-scale performance. 298 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10TABLE 10.2 Interdependence of Scale-up Parameters Production fermenter, 10,000:l Small fermenter, Constant, Constant, Constant, Constant, Scale-up criterion Designation 80 l P0/V N N \u00b7 Di Re Energy input P0 1.0 125 3125 25 0.2 Energy input/volume P0/V 1.0 1.0 25 0.2 0.0016 Impeller rotation N 1.0 0.34 1.0 0.2 0.04 number Impeller diameter Di 1.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 Pump rate of impeller Q 1.0 42.5 125 25 5.0 Pump rate of impeller/volume Q/V 1.0 0.34 1.0 0.2 0.04 Maximum impeller speed (max. shearing rate) N \u00b7 Di 1.0 1.7 5.0 1.0 0.2 Reynolds number ND2 ir/m 1.0 8.5 25.0 5.0 1.0 . Oldshue, 5:38 PM Page 298One approach to predicting possible reactor limitations is the use of characteristic time constants for conversion and transport processes. Table 10.3 defines some of the im-portant time constants, and Table 10.4 shows the application of these time constants to a20 m 3fermenter for the production of gluconic acid. Processes with time constants that are small compared to the main processes appear to be essentially at equilibrium. If, for example, 1/ kLa<<tO2conversion ( tO2conversion is the time constant for O2consumption), then the broth would be saturated with oxygen, be- cause oxygen supply is much more rapid than conversion. If, on the other hand, consump-tion is of the same order of magnitude as oxygen supply (e.g., 1/ k La\u00aatO2conversion), the dissolved oxygen concentration may be very low. This is precisely the case in Table 10.4and Fig. 10.6. The resulting experimental measurements of dissolved oxygen show the Sec. 10.2 Scale-up and Its Difficulties 299TABLE 10.3 Some Time Constants (Equations)a Transport process Equation Flow L/vor V/Q Diffusion L2/D Oxygen transfer 1/ kLa Heat transfer VrCp/UA Mixing tm=4V/(1.5ND3), stirred vessel Conversion processes: Growth 1/ m Chemical reaction Substrate consumption Cs/rmax(Cs>>Ks) Ks /rmax(Cs<<Ks) Heat production rCpDkT/rDH aWith permission, from N.

This het- erogeneity means that cells pass periodically through anaerobic regions. Since many cellshave regulatory circuits to respond to changes from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, thesecircuits may be constantly altering cellular metabolism. Traditional scale-up is highly empirical and makes sense only if there is no change in the controlling regime during scale-up, particularly if the system is only reaction oronly transport controlled. Common scale-up rules are the maintenance of constant power-to-volume ratios, constant k La, constant tip speed, a combination of mixing time and Reynolds number, and the maintenance of a constant substrate or product level (usuallydissolved-oxygen concentration). Each of these rules has resulted in both successful and 300 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10 Figure 10.6.

Results are more favorable with Newtonian broths than with non-Newtonian systems. The failure of any of these rules is related to changes in the controlling regime upon scale-up. No empirical rule can satisfactorily address such situations. Advances are beingmade in models that predict flow distribution, mixing times, and gas dispersion in fer-menters, as well as models to predict explicitly cellular responses to changes in the localenvironment. If these models can be integrated, they may provide a much more funda-mentally sound basis for scale-up. With the advent of improved supercomputers, the com-putational demands of such sophisticated models can be met. An approach to estimatingmixing times in a stirred fermenter is given in Example 10.4. It has been shown empirically for fermenter volumes of 0.1 to 100 m 3that mixing time can be correlated to reactor volume according to an expression like: (10.11) where tmis mixing time and Vis vessel volume. The constant, Tk, is a function of impeller type, placement, and vessel design. Equation 10.11 assumes multiple Rushton-type im-pellers and is based on data from vessels of different sizes at practical operating conditions. In summary, scale-up as currently practiced is an empirical, imprecise art. As long as geometric similarity is demanded at various scales, microenvironmental conditions cannotbe made scale independent. Models and the use of scale-down procedures are potential ap-proaches to improving scale-up, but these approaches are not yet fully developed. The nature of the practical operating boundaries for an aerated, agitated fermenter can be summarized as in Fig. 10.7. The exact placement of such boundaries depends onthe fermentation and change as the system is scaled up or scaled down. The boundariesare fuzzy rather than sharp. Nonetheless, the bioprocess engineer must appreciate the ex-istence of such constraints. 10.2.5. Scale-downAlthough scale-up models and the use of characteristic time analysis are potentially attrac- tive, a more immediate approach to the rational scaling of reactors is scale-down . The basic concept is to provide at a smaller scale an experimental system that duplicates exactly thetT Vm k =03. Sec. 10.2 Scale-up and Its Difficulties 301 Fig. 10.7.

In many cases, scale-up will require using existing production facilities, so it is important to mimic those productionfacilities at a smaller scale. At the smaller scale, many parameters can be tested more quicklyand inexpensively than at the production scale. Also, such a small-scale system can be usedto evaluate proposed process changes for an existing operating process. Figure 10.8 is a sketch of a smaller-scale apparatus to approximate the types of vari- ations in substrate and dissolved-oxygen concentrations that might be expected from amixing-time analysis (or from estimates from time constants) or from actual data onresidence-time distributions from a large reactor. The difference between this scale-downapparatus and a traditional smaller-scale fermenter in a pilot plant is that the type of appa-ratus described in Fig. 10.8 is constructed specifically to mimic a known piece of equip-ment. It should be noted that the apparatus in Fig. 10.8 would not mimic temperatureheterogeneity as it might exist in the larger system. Modifications to control temperatureseparately in each subvessel could be made. Such a scale-down apparatus could be used to estimate the system's response (e.g., growth rate, product formation, and formation of contaminating by-products) to changesin medium composition (e.g., a new supplier of raw materials), introduction of modifiedproduction strains, use of different inoculum preparations, new antifoam agents, and fortesting for O 2and CO2tolerance. Corrective protocols can be suggested also for use in the large-scale system by simulating the response to pH or oxygen-probe failure or compres-sor failure during different phases of the fermentation. Construction of scale-down apparatus can be a powerful complement to mathemati- cal models, scale-up rules, and traditional pilot-plant operation. Examples 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 illustrate scale-up issues. 302 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10 Figure 10.8. Experimental setup for scale-down experiments.

After a batch fermentation, the system is dismantled and approximately 75 %of the cell mass is suspended in the liquid phase (2 l), while 25 %is attached to the reactor walls and internals in a thick film (ca. 0.3 cm). Work with radioactive tracers shows that 50 %of the target prod- uct (intracellular) is associated with each cell fraction. The productivity of this reactor is 2 gproduct/l at the 2 l scale. What would be the productivity at 20,000 l scale if both reactors hada height-to-diameter ratio of 2 to 1? Solution Both tanks are geometrically similar, so we can calculate the diameter and the re- sulting surface area and volume in both tanks. For the 2 l system For the 20,000 l systems, At the bench scale (2 l) the amount of product made by surface-attached cells is The amount of product formed at 20,000 l due to surface-attached growth is The overall yield in the 2 l system is The overall yield in the 20,000 l system is If no wall growth had been present, the 20,000 l tank would have yielded 40,000 g. Thus, wall growth, if present, can seriously alter the productivity of a large-scale system upon scale-up. Example 10.3. Consider the scale-up of a fermentation from a 10 l to 10,000 l vessel. The small fermenter has a height-to-diameter ratio of 3. The impeller diameter is 30% of the tank diameter.Agitator speed is 500 rpm and three Rushton impellers are used.

Mixing times are experimentally de- terminable by step addition of an electrolyte. The conductivity can be measured continuouslyat various locations distant from the injection site. A production fermenter usually contains multiple impellers. An effective modeling ap- proach is to divide the contents of the large tank into mixing compartments, where each com-partment is perfectly mixed. As indicated in Fig. 10.9, a simple model is to consider that aseparate compartment is associated with each impeller. In this problem, we let Hbe the over- all mass transfer coefficient between compartments. The transient mass balances and experi-mental data can be used to estimate a value of H. Consider the case where Hhas been determined to be 0.43 s -1for a 10 l vessel and 0.075 s-1for a 10,000 l vessel. With E. coli fermentations, glucose feed rates in a fed batch are adjusted to maintain a constant, relatively low concentration of glucose to prevent the for-mation of toxic metabolites (e.g., acetate) that would limit the ultimate cell concentration.Assume that the desired glucose concentration is 25 mg/l and that the Monod kinetics can beapproximated as first order with a rate constant of about 0.05 s -1. Assume the cell concentra- tion changes slowly. Assume that the glucose supplemental feed is sufficiently concentratedthat the total fluid volume in the reactor is constant. Also, assume that F, the mass addition rate of glucose per unit reactor volume, changes slowly in comparison to the characteristicmixing and reaction times. Compare the variation in glucose concentrations in the small andlarge tanks when an ideal probe (no error or lag in measurement) is used to maintain theset-point concentration at 25 mg/l in the middle compartment. Consider the response if theprobe is placed in the top compartment instead of the middle compartment.Solution Note that Fand k 1are closely related. As the cells grow, k1increases, which changes the demand for glucose ( F). Because Fchanges more slowly than the characteristic time constants for mixing, we assume a quasi-steady state.

The solution to the preceding set of equations is (d) (e) (f) If the probe is placed in the middle compartment, then C2=25 mg/l if the control sys- tem is perfect. Using eq. e, we calculate F=3.9 mg/l-s in the small tank and F=4.6 mg/l-s in the large tank. Values for C1and C3are found from eqs. d, e, and f.

It should also be clear that probe placement in a less than perfectly mixed vessel will have significant effects on re-actions within that vessel.CC C12 325 - ( )- 10.3.1. IntroductionThe maintenance of optimal conditions for product formation in the complex environment in a bioreactor requires the control and measurement of at least a few parameters. Almostall fermenters have pH, temperature, and dissolved-oxygen control (by control of agitatorrotational speed). New probes and techniques for the measurement of various ions, sub-strates, and products are being developed and have been implemented in particular situa-tions. Actual process-control strategies for bioreactors are very primitive in comparison tothe petrochemical industry, because of a lack of sensors for on-line measurements and ofreliable, quantitative, dynamically accurate models. In this section we will summarizebriefly not only the state of the art but some ideas on opportunities to improve the controlof bioreactors. 10.3.2. Instrumentation for Measurements of Active Fermentation The maintenance of sterility in a fermenter imposes a severe limitation on obtaining on-line measurements of fermentation parameters. Some probes (e.g., pH and dissolvedoxygen) enter the reactor through penetrations in the fermenter shell. Each penetrationsignificantly increases the probability of contamination. Thus, the benefit in increasedproductivity from the use of each probe must outweigh the economic losses that resultfrom an increased number of contamination events. The probes themselves must also besterilizable, preferably with steam. Thus, probes must ideally be able to withstand moder-ately high temperatures (121\u00b0C) in the presence of 100 %humidity. Chemical sterilization, which is less desirable, may allow the use of a temperature-sensitive device if it has suffi-cient chemical resistance. Any general technique for monitoring fermentations must becompatible with the limitations imposed by sterility requirements. Techniques to monitor the physical environment are summarized in Table 10.5. Ex- cept for viscosity and turbidity, these parameters would be monitored on most pilot-plantfermenters and many industrial fermenters. Each parameter is generally subject to its ownclosed-loop control system. These individual control loops may be integrated into anoverall control package, especially at the pilot-plant scale, but in many cases higher-levelcontrol is not practiced, owing to the difficulty of measuring key parameters (e.g., productconcentration) and the lack of dynamically accurate process models. On-line measurements of concentrations beyond pH and dissolved oxygen are diffi- cult, although exciting progress is being made. Table 10.6 summarizes techniques thathave been considered for determining the concentrations of key components. With insertable probes, we need to worry not only about probe performance but also about probe placement. The heterogeneity in a large fermenter means that dissolvedoxygen and substrate levels (and to a lesser extent pH) will be position dependent (see Ex-ample 10.4). Although placement in the midsection of the vessel often gives the most rep-resentative values, mechanical design considerations may dictate placement elsewhere.Because probe fouling is a potential problem, the probe should be inserted in a region Sec. 10.3 Bioreactor Instrumentation and Control 307ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 307with sufficient turbulence to help keep it clean. Although the use of multiple probes would be desirable, the increased risk of contamination often argues against it. Even with accu-rate probe response, the interpretation of that response in a large fermenter must be donecarefully. Since many fermentations require extensive periods for completion (2 to 20 days), it is important that probe response be stable for extended periods. Industrial fermentationbroths contain many proteins and other organics that have a significant tendency to adsorbonto surfaces. Many microbes also have a strong tendency to adhere to surfaces. Thus,probe fouling in an extended fermentation is a constant problem. Drift is a problem in some probes, and recalibration in situ is not always possible. If sterility is to be main- tained, the removal and replacement of probes is practically impossible. In some cases,special designs allowing some back-flushing are possible. However, the quality of infor-mation available tends to decrease as the length of a fermentation cycle increases. Exit-gas measurements, particularly with mass spectrometers, are of increasing in- terest. Advances in building robust process instruments at lower cost have made this amore attractive proposition, particularly when such an instrument can be used for severalfermenters (e.g., using a computer-controlled switching manifold). The main limitation onexit-gas analysis is that only volatile components can be monitored. 308 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10TABLE 10.5 Monitoring and Control of the Physical Environment Parameter Measuring devices(s) Comments 1.

Although this assay is not routine, many vendorsare actively developing systems for this application. However, this method, as well asmost others using a liquid slip stream, requires sample preparation and has a significanttime delay associated with sampling. Typically, a small side stream is pumped from thereactor, and microfiltration or an ultrafilter is used to remove cells and particulates. Thefiltrate usually requires further processing (e.g., the removal of compounds that could foulthe analytical-grade columns). After injection of the sample, there can be a significanttime (min) before a response is obtained. One other problem with slip streams is the po-tential for contamination; the membrane filtration step is of particular concern. Nonethe-less, the use of liquid slip streams allows the relatively rapid determination of importantproduct information. Other methods not listed in Table 10.6 have the potential to significantly affect the on-line measurement of fermentation parameters. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) hasgiven important information on intracellular metabolism for off-line or small-scale growthexperiments. In situ NMR has the potential for use with at least bench-scale systems, al- though significant technical advances must first be made. Selective fluorescence in com-bination with flow cytometry has given important information, off line, on the distributionof intracellular parameters (e.g., plasmid content) in a population. The adaptation of suchtechniques to on-line measurement is conceivable, but again a number of technical prob-ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 310lems would need to be solved. Another analytical method that offers a good potential for on-line determination of solutes is Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra analysis. Fi-nally, the use of spectra analysis combined with optical fibers may offer a good techniqueto determine cell mass in the presence of other suspended solids. In summary, current instrumentation to monitor fermenters on line is very limited. However, many techniques currently under development promise to solve this problem. 10.3.3. Using the Information Obtained Having information is one thing; using it wisely is another. Current fermenter design and control techniques are rather limited. We do not have a fully satisfactory approach to theeffective use of information on the extracellular and intracellular chemical environment. Computer-controlled fermenters are fairly common, particularly at the pilot-plant scale. Figure 10.10 displays an overview of the software functions for a typical antibioticfermentation facility, and Fig. 10.11 shows the relationship of primary measurements tosecondary parameters. An important function of such systems is data logging . This information is unusu- ally important in the food and pharmaceutical industries. An actual record for the manu-facture of each product batch is required by regulatory agencies. If the product is laterfound to be unsafe, such information can be used to trace the problem. Beyond the regula-tory concerns, the lack of good high-level control strategies leads to a control strategybased on exactly duplicating a particular recipe. Consistency from batch to batch is an im-portant consideration. Expert control systems may be useful in such situations. In many cases, fermentation control schemes have begun to move beyond simple open-loop environmental control strategies. The use of computers allows the rapidmanipulation of information from the data-logging operation to yield estimates of sec-ondary parameters. For example, a secondary parameter may be cell concentration esti-mated from estimates of oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide evolution based onprimary measurements of off-gas composition and dissolved-gas concentrations. Essen-tially, cell mass is estimated from mass balances using information from what have beentermed gateway sensors . The main limitation to this approach is the accumulation of error. For example, in estimating cell mass Xat time t, the value of Xat time t-Dtmust be known. Any systematic errors in cell mass estimates or the inability of an algorithm to re-spond to an unusual perturbation can lead to significant difficulties over the length of atypical culture cycle. Data-handling procedures to mitigate this problem have been sug-gested (e.g., Kalman filters). In some cases our partial knowledge of cellular metabolism is sufficient to solve im- portant bioreactor problems. For many years it was thought impossible to grow E. coli to high cell densities ( > 15 or 20 g/l). An improved understanding of cell physiology led to the observation that it was the buildup of toxic metabolic by-products (primarily acetate)that inhibited growth. Acetate is formed in E. coli when a good carbon source, such as glucose, is available in high concentrations. Control strategies that feed glucose at a ratesufficient to maintain at least moderately good growth without forming acetate were seenas possibilities to improve reactor volumetric productivities. Thus, several possible control strategies are immediately apparent. The simplest perhaps would be to measure acetate concentration on line and reduce nutrient feed rates Sec. 10.3 Bioreactor Instrumentation and Control 311ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 311312 Figure 10.10.

Prave, eds., Hanser Publishers, New York, 1988, p. 203.)ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 312in response to acetate accumulation. On-line measurement of acetate is not now routine, but improvements in sensors certainly make this a tenable approach. A strategy that is eas-ier to implement with current sensors is based on measuring the rates of carbon dioxideevolution. Measurement of carbon dioxide in the off-gas, coupled with information onsubstrate concentration in the feed and nutrient flow rates, allows the glucose feed rate tobe manipulated to maintain glucose concentrations at an optimal level. This indirect strat-egy depends on the use of mass balances and the gateway sensor concept. Another strat-egy is to control glucose concentration with a feedback control system, if a glucosesensing system is available. The easiest approach is to use a predetermined glucose feed-ing schedule, although this usually results in significant periods of sub- or superoptimalglucose concentrations. These strategies have been used successfully. High-density E. coli cultures (ca. 100 g dry wt/l) have greatly increased product concentration and productivi-ties in E. coli -based fermentations to make proteins from recombinant DNA. At these high densities, special strategies for oxygen supply (e.g., O 2-enriched gas) are often required. This example illustrates the important interaction between process-control strategies andcellular metabolism. As we develop better sensors and a better understanding of metabolic pathways, it becomes more feasible to combine information from primary sensors with models of me-tabolism to develop better control strategies. Without direct measurement of the product,simple feedback control on the process itself is impossible. Without extremely good Sec. 10.3 Bioreactor Instrumentation and Control 313 Figure 10.11.

Because of the highly nonlinear nature of most culture systems, black-box techniques to develop dy-namic models are usually ineffective. Good process control for fermentations awaits im-proved models of cultures, more sophisticated sensors, and advances in nonlinear controltheory. In addition to reactor control, a computer monitored and controlled process involves the control of medium preparation, sterilization, and some downstream recovery pro-cesses. An important factor in bioprocesses is the predominance of batch processing. Thescheduling of equipment is critical, and these tasks are being done increasingly with theaid of in-house computers. In summary, exciting progress is being made in instrumentation and modeling, but the possible contributions of process control to bioprocesses have been only marginallyrealized. 10.4. STERILIZATION OF PROCESS FLUIDS 10.4.1. Introduction and the Kinetics of DeathModern fermenters consume large amounts of media and gas. The tens of thousands of liters of medium and millions of liters of air used in a typical antibiotic fermentation mustbe absolutely devoid of any contaminating organism. The economic penalty for contami-nation is high. With bioprocesses to make proteins from recombinant DNA, the exitstreams must also be treated to prevent the discharge of any living cell. The ability to en-sure the destruction of viable organisms is critical. Sterility is an absolute concept; a system is never partially or almost sterile. How- ever, with a 100,000-l fermenter, we cannot sample every drop of fluid for a foreignorganism. On a practical basis, sterility means the absence of any detectable viable organ-ism, and a pure culture means that only the desired organism is detectably present. Disinfection differs from sterilization. A disinfecting agent will greatly reduce the number of viable organisms, often a specific type of organism, to a low, but nonzerovalue. Fluid streams can be sterilized through the physical removal of cells and viruses or the inactivation of living particles by heat, radiation, or chemicals. If sterilization is ac-complished by inactivating living cells, spores, or viruses, we need to understand thekinetics of death. Death in this case means the failure of the cell, spore, or virus to repro- duce or germinate when placed in a favorable environment. When dealing with steriliza-tion, the probabilistic nature of cell death cannot be ignored. The simplest case presumes that all the viable cells or spores are identical. The probability of extinction of the total population, P 0(t), is (10.12) where p(t) is the probability that an individual will still be viable at time t,and N0is the number of individuals initially present. The expected value of the number of individualspresent at time t, E[N(t)], isPt 10() =- () Page 314(10.13) while the variance about this number is (10.14) The specific death rate, kd, is (10.15a) and if p(t) is not a function of N(t), then (10.15b) The functional form for p(t) depends on the organism and environment. The sim- plest form is to assume a first-order death model in which kdis a constant and has units of reciprocal time: (10.16) In the microbiological literature, the term decimal reduction time (D) is often used. It is the time for the number of viable cells to decrease tenfold. For example, with kdas a con- stant, Dis (10.17a) (10.17b) (10.17c) A plot of ln N(t)/N0versus time is called a survival curve (see Fig. 10.12). Such a curve is implicitly deterministic; the deterministic and probabilistic approaches give es-sentially the same result as long as N(t) is >> 1 (about 10 to 100). Extrapolation of a sur- vival curve to one organism or less is not proper. Most real populations are not homogeneous. Often a subgroup is more resistant to the sterilization agent. Also, organisms growing in clumps tend to be more resistant todeath. These factors are important in processing (see Fig. 10.13 for the effects on survivalcurves). For example, consider a tragic error in the early development of a polio vaccine.The virus is inactivated (\"killed\"). The required processing time was estimated from lin-ear extrapolation (on a semilog plot) of a survival curve. The original data for the plot didnot extend to sufficiently low numbers to detect the presence of a resistant subpopulation.Consequently, some patients were inoculated with live rather than killed virus. 10.4.2 Sterilization of LiquidsThe kinetics of death apply to the sterilization of liquids. Values for k dcan be determined for inactivation by chemical, thermal, or radioactive agents. Thermal inactivation is 315ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 315316 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10 Figure 10.12.

F.Millis, Biochemical Engineering , 2d ed., University of Tokyo Press, Tokyo, 1973, p. 241.) much preferred for the economic, large-scale sterilization of equipment and liquids. How- ever, heat-sensitive equipment must be sterilized with chemical agents or radiation. The use of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is effective to sterilize surfaces, but UV cannot penetrate fluids easily, particularly those with high amounts of suspended material. Al-though x-rays can penetrate more deeply, cost and safety considerations preclude their usein large-scale systems. A chemical agent for sterilization must leave no residue that would be toxic to the desired culture. Ethylene oxide, a gas, can be used to sterilize equipment. A 70%ethanol-water mixture acidified to a pH of 2 with HCl kills virtually all vegetative cellsch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 316and many spores and can be used to sterilize equipment. A formaldehyde solution is often effective. Sodium hypochlorite solution (3%) has been used in sterilizing (or disinfecting)small-scale, heat-sensitive equipment. Some chemicals (e.g., ozone) cannot usually beused to sterilize fluids without adverse side reactions affecting medium quality. For most large-scale equipment and liquids, thermal sterilization is used (filter ster- ilization is the only practical alternative for liquids). Usually, the dependence of the spe-cific death rate on temperature is given by an Arrhenius equation: (10.18) where Ris the gas constant, Tis absolute temperature, and E 0dis the activation energy for the death of the organism. Values for E0drange from about 50 to 150 kcal/g-mol. For spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus , E0d\u00aa70 kcal/g-mol, and values of 127 kcal/g-mol have been determined for E. coli . Most thermal sterilizations take place at 121 C. The val- ues for kdin such situations are very high for vegetative cells (often > 1010min-1). For spores, the values of kdtypically range from 0.5 to 5.0 min-1. In most cases we are only concerned about spores when steam-sterilizing equipment and media, since the value of kd is so much lower with spores than vegetative cells. The E0dfor vitamins and growth factors in many media is about 2 to 20 kcal/g-mol. The inactivation of viability is much more sensitive to temperature changes than thedegradation of important growth factors in the medium. This factor is important to the de-sign of sterilization equipment and protocols so as to assure complete killing of foreignorganisms without the destruction of necessary growth factors in the medium. The main factors in any sterilization protocol are the temperature, time of exposure, and initial number of organisms that must be killed. The problems of sterilization increasekedEdRT=-a0 Sec. 10.4 Sterilization of Process Fluids 317 Figure 10.13. Overall survival curve (D) for a system with three distinct subpopulations (A, B, and C). Population A is normally dominant, but it is the one most sensitive to thesterilizing agent, while subpopulation C is far more resistant.ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 317with scale-up. Consider the probability of an unsuccessful fermentation, [1 -P0(t)], in a reactor, (10.19a) or with a simple model of killing in homogeneous populations: (10.19b) N0in eq. 10.19 corresponds to the number of individuals in the reactor, not the concentra- tion of organisms. Let n0be the concentration of particles. Now consider the probability of an unsuccessful sterilization in a 1 l and 10,000 l reactor, where each contains the sameidentical solution ( n 0is the same in both tanks), and the temperature ( kd) and time of ster- ilization are identical. Thus, for the 1-l tank (10.20a) and for the 10,000-l tank (10.20b) If kdtis 15 and n0=104spores/l in both cases, the probability of an unsuccessful fermenta- tion is 0.003 in the 1-l vessel and about 1 in the 10,000-l tank (5 \u00b7 10-14probability of ex- tinction of the spores). Thus, the sterilization protocol that would be acceptable for alaboratory bench-scale experiment would be totally unacceptable for the larger-scale sys-tem. The larger tank would require much longer exposure to the same temperature toachieve the same degree of sterility, and the longer exposure to higher temperatures couldlead to greater changes in the chemical composition of the medium. A sterilization chart can be constructed from eq. 10.19b. An example is depicted in Fig. 10.14. To use such a chart, you need to specify the probability of failure that is ac-ceptable (for example, 10 -3) and the number of particles initially present in the fluid (n0\u00b7 total volume). For 10-3and N0=108, the corresponding value of kdtis about 26. If kd=1 min-1at 121 C, then t=26 min corresponds to the exposure time at 121 C required to ensure that 999 sterilizations out of a 1000 are successful. Steam sterilizations can be accomplished batchwise, often in situ in the fermenta- tion vessel, or in a continuous apparatus (Fig. 10.15). The greatest difficulty with batchsterilization is thermal lags and incomplete mixing. Typically, batch sterilization occurs at121 C. The time required to heat the fluid to 121 C and to cool it back to growth tempera- tures (e.g., 37 C) is often much longer than the time of exposure to the desired tempera- ture. For most spores, k dfalls very rapidly with temperatures (e.g., a tenfold decrease for kdat T=110 C rather than 121 C), so the heat-up and cool-down periods do little to aug- ment spore killing. However, the elevated temperatures during heat-up and cool-down canbe very damaging to vitamins and proteins, can lead to carmelization reactions for sugars,and can greatly alter medium quality. Continuous sterilization , particularly a high-temperature, short-exposure time, can achieve complete sterilization with much less damage to the medium. Both the heat-up11 1010 0000-= - - [] Pt p Operation, and 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 318and cool-down periods are very rapid. Continuous sterilization is easier to control and re- duces downtime in the fermenters. Two potential disadvantages of the continuous processare dilution of the medium with steam injection and foaming. The flow pattern inside thepipe is critical, since the fluid residence time near the wall can be different from that inthe center. The average flow rate and the length of the sterilizing section should be de-signed to ensure high Peclet numbers (above 500), so that the velocity distribution ap-proaches piston-like flow. In addition to steam sterilization, process fluids can be filter sterilized. Filter steril- ization is necessary when the medium contains heat-sensitive materials. An important ex- ample of filter sterilization in bioprocesses is the sterilization of medium to support thegrowth of animal cells. Microporous filters (pore sizes < 0.2 mm) are typically used. The filters should be absolute filters; no pores larger than the nominal pore size must exist. Avery narrow pore-size distribution is advantageous. The medium may be first prefiltered toremove large particulates that might plug the microporous filter. The actual microporousfilter must be sterilized. The equipment that receives the filtered-sterilized fluid is alsosterilized. Filter sterilization is not as reliable as steam sterilization. Any defect in the mem- brane can lead to failure. Viruses and mycoplasma (small wall-less bacteria) can pass thefilter. Consequently, filtered-sterilized medium is usually quarantined for a period of time Sec. 10.4 Sterilization of Process Fluids 319 Figure 10.14. Sterilization chart. (With permission, from M. L. Shuler, Encyclopedia of Physical Science and Technology , V ol. 2, p. 427, Academic Press, New York, 1987.)ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 319to allow any contaminants to multiply to a detectable number. Clearly, a period of quaran- tine will detect only vegetative cells and not host-dependent contaminants (e.g., viruses). Filter sterilization is used not only to filter medium, but also to sterilize process air. 10.4.3. Sterilization of Gases Aerobic fermentations require huge volumes of air. At 0.1 to 1 volume of gas per volume of liquid per minute, a 50,000-l fermenter requires 7 \u00b7 106l to 7 \u00b7 107l per day of air. Many fermentations are several days in duration. For a five-day fermentation, as much as 2 \u00b7 10 8l of air may be required. This volume of air must be absolutely sterile. Typically, the concentration of microbes in air is 103to 104/m3or 1 to 10 microbes/l. Fed-batch or continuous culture systems place even more stringent demands on air sterilization, sinceair filters cannot be replaced during the run period. An air supply of this magnitude requires sizable air compressors. Adiabatic com- pression of air can increase the air temperature (typically 150\u00b0 to 220\u00b0C). Dry heat is less 320 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10 Figure 10.15. Comparison of a batch (A) with a continuous sterilization strategy (B) for the temperature profile of the medium sterilized. The continuous unit allows short-time,high-temperature sterilization.ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 320effective in killing organisms than moist heat. To kill spores, a temperature typically of 220 C for 30 s is required. Consequently, the adiabatic compression of process air certainly aids airsterilization. Since the exit air cools rapidly and the pipes connecting the compressor to thefermenter are difficult to maintain as absolutely sterile, an air-filtration step is almost alwaysused. (Alternatives such as UV radiation, ozone injection, and scrubbing are not practical.) The filtration of gases can be accomplished using either depth filters or surface fil- ters. Historically, depth filters using glass wool were used, but depth filters have been al- most totally replaced with membrane cartridge filters, which are surface filters . Glass wool filters rely on a combination of mechanisms for the capture of particles. Possible mechanisms of removal for particles of about 1- mm diameter are direct intercep- tion, electrostatic effects, diffusion (or Brownian motion), and inertial effects. As theflowing gas approaches a fiber, the flow streamlines must curve around the fiber. If a par-ticle had no density, it would follow the streamlines around the fiber. Only particles whosecenters are on streamlines less than a particle radius away from the fiber could be inter-cepted. However, for real particles, inertial effects mean that particles with mass will havea tendency to maintain a straight-line trajectory as they approach the fiber. Thus, such par-ticles deviate from the streamline and crash into the fiber. Both interception and inertialeffects are important in removing bacteria. Diffusional effects may be important for virus removal, but bacteria are sufficiently large that diffusion is relatively unimportant. The removal of a particle by these mecha-nisms is probabilistic. The deeper the filter is, the smaller the probability of a particle pen-etrating the depth of the filter. Depth filters using glass wool can show shrinkage and hardening upon steam steril- ization. In such cases, channeling can occur, and the filter becomes far less effective thanwould be predicted. More recent advances in the design of fiberglass filter cartridges haveovercome much of this disadvantage. Another serious problem with such fibrous filters iswetting. If a filter wets, an easy path becomes available for a contaminant to penetratethrough it. A wet filter also greatly increases pressure drop. Thus, any condensation withinsuch a filter must be avoided. Surface filters (membrane cartridges) work using another mechanism for particle re- moval, a sieving effect. Figure 10.16 depicts a membrane cartridge unit and its housing.Membranes with uniformly small pores prevent the passage of particles with a radiuslarger than the pore radius. Such filters can be steam-sterilized many times. Also, any con-densate formed on the nonsterile side cannot pass into the sterile side. With both depth filters and membrane cartridges, pressure drop is critical. The en- ergy input for compressed air for a commercial-scale process is significant. Air treatmentcan account for 25 %of total production costs. Thus, the design engineer has to balance the assurance of sterility against pressure drop. Generally, the bioprocess engineer is not involved in the design of membrane car- tridge units (a number of competent vendors offer suitable products), but the testing ofsuch units for effectiveness is important. In the United States, an example is an aerosoltest using corn oil nebulized to 1.0 to 1.5 mg oil/l of air. This test is recognized by theFDA. Such an aerosol would contain particles primarily in the range of 0.2- to 1.0- mm di- ameters. Aerosol in the exit gas from a filter cartridge can be monitored by a photometer.The number of sterilization cycles a cartridge can undergo before failure is an importantcriterion in the selection of membrane cartridge units. Sec. 10.4 Sterilization of Process Fluids 321ch10 10/11/01 5:38 PM Page 321Other tests for the integrity of the unit are pressure-drop-versus-flow-rate and bubble-point tests, which detect defects in the membrane and maximum pore size.\"Grow-through\" tests use a sterile nutrient solution on one side of the membrane and asimilar nutrient solution inoculated with a test strain (e.g., Pseudomonas diminuta ) on the nonsterile side. The greater the integrity of the filter, the longer it will take before growthon the nominally sterile side will occur. A filter should be evaluated with several differenttypes of tests. Because of the high costs associated with the loss of a batch due to contamination, the choice of air filter to give dependable protection for a fermentation while minimizingpressure drop is critical. 322 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors Chap. 10 Figure 10.16.

With fermentations involving pathogens (disease-causing organisms) or recombinant DNA, all organisms must be re- moved from the exhaust gas. The concentration of microbes in the exit gas is far higherthan in the inlet gas. Catalytically aided combustion (incineration) of the exit gas is aneffective, but expensive, solution. Consequently, filtration of the exit air is of increasingimportance. 10.5. SUMMARY Scale-up of reactors is a task primarily for the biochemical engineer. Three basic reactor types for the aerobic cultivation of suspended cells are (1) systems with internal mechani- cal agitation , (2) bubble columns , and (3) loop reactors . Although the bubble and loop re- actors offer advantages in terms of energy efficiency and reduced shear damage to cells,the traditional stirred-tank system is more flexible and can better handle broths that be-come highly viscous. The primary limitations on the size of stirred-tank bioreactors are gas supply (e.g., O 2) and heat removal. The value of kLa, the volumetric transfer coefficient , is of prime concern. Its value depends not only on the equipment used, gas flow rates, and agitatorspeed, but also on the nature of the fluid (salt content, presence of surface active agents,and viscosity). The properties of the fluid can change during the fermentation. By directlymonitoring oxygen concentration in the gas phase and the dissolved-oxygen level, it ispossible to make on-line estimates of k La. If the rate of oxygen uptake is known, the rate of heat generation can be readily estimated in aerobic fermentations. Scale-up is difficult, because conditions in a large vessel are much more hetero- geneous than in a small vessel. If geometrically similar tanks are used, it is impossibleto maintain shear, mixing times, and k Lasimultaneously identical in both the large and small tank. Scale-up would be simplified if good reaction models could be coupled togood transport models; since this is not yet possible, scale-down techniques are a good alternative. Bioreactor instrumentation and control are less advanced than in the petrochemical industry. Improvements in sensor technology and the dynamical models of bioreactors arecritical to improvements in control technology. The large-scale bioreactor places heavy demands on processes to sterilize (kill or re- move all organisms from) fluids entering the bioreactor. Liquid streams are thermally ster-ilized or filter sterilized. Steam terilization is preferred, but the sterilization process mustnot damage the ability of the medium to support growth. Since longer periods of exposureto high temperatures are necessary to assure sterility in larger volumes of liquid, the steril-ization process can alter the medium composition more for large-scale than forsmall-scale systems. This is an additional factor that can lead to differences in productiv-ity upon scale-up. Continuous sterilization protects the medium components from degra- dation better than batch sterilization, because the heat-up and cool-down periods aregreatly minimized. Filter sterilization of liquids is used when the medium contains partic- ularly heat-sensitive components. Air streams are typically filter sterilized. Surface filters(membrane cartridges) are commonly used in gas sterilization.

A value of kLa=30 h-1has been determined for a fermenter at its maximum practical agitator rotational speed and with air being sparged at 0.5 l gas/l reactor volume-min. E. coli with a qO2of 10 mmol O2/g-dry wt-h are to be cultured. The critical dissolved oxygen concentration is 0.2 mg/l. The solubility of oxygen from air in the fermentation broth is 7.3 mg/l at 30 C. a.What maximum concentration of E. coli can be sustained in this fermenter under aerobic conditions? b.What concentration could be maintained if pure oxygen was used to sparge the reactor? 10.3. a.

The desired operating temperature is 35\u00b0C. A cooling coil is to be used. The minimum allowable tem-perature differential between the cooling water and the broth is 5\u00b0C. Cooling water isavailable at 15\u00b0C. The heat capacities of the broth and the cooling water are roughlyequal. b.Estimate the required length of cooling coil if the coil has a 2.5-cm diameter and the over- all heat transfer coefficient is 1420 J/s-m 2-\u00b0C. 10.4.

Consider the 10-l and 10,000-l tanks described in Example 10.4. Suppose that fully continu- ous operation is to be used, and Fwas fixed at 5 mg/l-s for both tanks, and D =0.2 h-1for each tank with fluid removal from the top. What fraction of the inlet substrate would be con-sumed in each tank? If the biomass yield coefficient were 0.5 g cells/g substrate and Y P/X = 0.1 g product/g cells, what would be the effect on volumetric productivity upon scale-up? 10.6. A continuous culture system is being constructed. The fermentation tank is to be 50,000 l in size and the residence time is to be 2 h. A continuous sterilizer is to be used. The unsterilizedmedium contains 10 4spores/l. The value of kdhas been determined to be 1 min-1at 121 C and 61 min-1at 140 C. For each temperature (121 C and 140 C), determine the required res- idence time in the holding section so as to ensure that 99% of the time four weeks of continu-ous operation can be obtained without contamination (due to contaminants in the liquidmedium). 10.7. Discuss the effects on sterilization of mixing in a batch fermenter. 10.8. A medium containing a vitamin is to be sterilized. Assume that the number of spores initially present is 10 5/l.

Consider the data given in the table on the temperature changes in a 10,000-l fermenter, which includes the heat-up and cool-down periods. Use the values for the Arrhenius parame-ters given in Problem 10.8 and assume an initial spore concentration of 10 5/l and a vitamin concentration of 30 mg/l. 326 Selection, Scale-up, Operation, and Control of Bioreactors 5:38 PM Page 326a.What is the probability of a successful sterilization? b.What fraction of the vitamin remains undegraded? c.What fraction of the vitamin is degraded in the sterilization period? d.What fraction of the vitamin is degraded in the heat-up and cool-down periods? e.What is the fraction of spores deactivated in the heat-up and cool-down cycles? 10.10. E. coli have rate, qO2max, of about 240-mg O2/g-dry wt-h. It is desired to achieve a cell mass of 20 g dry wt/l. The kLais 120 h-1in a 1000-l reactor (800 l working volume). A gas stream enriched in oxygen is used (i.e., 80 %O2) which gives a value of C* = 28 mg/L. If oxygen becomes limiting, growth and respiration slow; for example, where CLis the dissolved oxygen concentration in the fermenter. What is CLwhen the cell mass is at 20 g/l? 10.11. The temperature history of the heating and cooling of a 40,000-l tank during sterilization of medium is: 0 to 15 min, T=85\u00b0C; 15 to 40 min, T=121\u00b0C; 40 to 50 min, T=85\u00b0C; 50 to 60 min, T=55\u00b0C; > 60 min, T=30\u00b0C. The medium contains vitamins, the most fragile of the vi- tamins has an activation energy for destruction of 10 kcal/g-mol, and the value of a(see eq. 10.18) is 1 \u00b7 104min-1. Assume vitamin destruction is first order and the initial concentration is 50 mg/l. Ris 1.99 cal/g-mol-\u00b0K. The medium contains 2.5 103spores/l. The spores have an E0d= 65 kcal/g-mol, and kdat 121\u00b0C is 1.02 min-1. Estimate: (a) the probability of a suc- cessful sterilization, and (b) what fraction of the vitamin remains active? 10.12.

STRATEGIES TO RECOVER AND PURIFY PRODUCTS The recovery and purification of a fermentation product is essential to any commercial process. The difficulty entailed depends heavily on the nature of the product. Products maybe the biomass itself, an extracellular component, or an intracellular component. Since thechemical nature of a fermentation broth is quite complex and extremely high purity is re-quired for some products (e.g., some pharmaceuticals), recovery and purification often re-quire many processing steps and in many cases represent a manufacturing cost higher thanthat involved in producing the product. Since the compounds of interest are often fragile(e.g., heat sensitive) and present in dilute aqueous solution, the traditional separation tech-niques of the chemical engineer must be augmented with more specialized ones. Recovery and purification are major expenses in production of most fermentation products; often they comprise more than 50% of the total manufacturing costs, especiallyfor an intracellular product. There is an excellent correlation between the price of a prod-uct (on a per-kg basis) and how dilute the product is as it exits the fermentation. For ex-ample, citric acid is on the order of 100 g/l when it enters recovery processes and sells fororder of 1 to 2 $/kg, while a therapeutic protein might be at the concentration of 0.00001g/l and sell for 100,000,000 $/kg. The efficiency of the production process and the diffi-culty and cost of the recovery and purification processes are tightly coupled. The major unit operations used for product recovery and purification and the major principles of separations are summarized in Fig. 11.1. Separation methods vary with the11 Recovery and Purification of Productsch11 10/11/01 106 103 1Microfilters Cloth and filters Screens and strainers Ultrafiltration Gel chromatography Distysis Electrodialysis Ion exchange Distillation/freeze concentration bubble fractionation Ultracentrifuges Centrifuges Liquid cyclones Gravity rangeFine particle rangeCoarse particle rangeMacromolecular range Figure 11.1.

The strategy in Fig. 11.2 can be generalized to involve four primary functions: (1) separation of insoluble products and other solids, (2) primary isolation or concentra-tion of product and removal of most of the water, (3) purification or removal of contami-nating chemicals, and (4) product preparation, such as drying. Process economics dictatethat water must be removed very early in the process train so that the size of the equip-ment in the following steps will be minimized. Because a step designed primarily to con-centrate product and the steps designed to remove contaminating chemicals often removesolvent, there is no distinct separation between steps 2 and 3. We will treat these steps bydescribing in the same section operations to recover soluble compounds. First, however,we consider those steps that remove solids, such as cells or the insoluble material. 11.2. SEPARATION OF INSOLUBLE PRODUCTS The separation of solids such as biomass, insoluble particles, and macromolecules from the fermentation broth is usually the first step in product recovery. In some cases, thebroth may need to be pretreated to facilitate solids separation. Examples of pretreatmentare heat treatment, pH and ionic strength adjustment, and the addition of coagulants and Sec. 11.2 Separation of Insoluble Products 331 Figure 11.2. Major steps involved in the separation and purification of intracellularenzymes.ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 331flocculants. If the product is biomass, then separation of solids is the major step in product recovery, which results in a significant volume reduction. If the product is a soluble com-pound, solids need to be separated from liquid before the liquid is further treated to re-cover and purify the soluble product. For the recovery of intracellular products, the cellsneed to be disrupted and other cellular products need to be separated from the desiredproduct. The major methods used for the separation of cellular material (biomass) are (1) filtration (both rotary vacuum filtration and micro- or ultrafiltration), (2) centrifuga-tion, and (3) coagulation and flocculation. 11.2.1. FiltrationFiltration is probably the most cost-effective method for the separation of large solid parti- cles and cells from fermentation broth. Fermentation broth is passed through a filtermedium, and a filter cake is formed as a result of deposition of solids on the filter surface.Continuous rotary filters or rotary vacuum precoat filters are the most widely used types in the fermentation industry. The drum is covered with a layer of precoat, usually of di-atomaceous earth, prior to filtration. A small amount of coagulating agent or filter aid isadded to the broth before it is pumped into the filter. As the drum rotates under vacuum, athin layer of cells adhere to the drum. The thickness of the cell layer increases in the sec-tion designed for forming the cake. The layer of solids is washed and dewatered during itspassage to the discharge point, where a knife blade cuts off the cake. A vacuum main-tained in the drum provides the driving force for liquid and air flow. A schematic diagramof a continuous rotary vacuum filter is shown in Fig. 11.3. Filtration is commonly used for separating mycelium from fermentation broth in antibiotic fermentations. It is also commonly used in waste-water treatment facilities. The rate of filtration (the flow of filtrate) for a constant-pressure (vacuum) filtration operation is determined primarily by the resistance of the cake and filter medium: (11.1) where Vis the volume of filtrate, Ais the surface area of the filter, Dpis the pressure drop through the cake and filter medium, mis the viscosity of the filtrate, r mis the resistance ofdV dtgp A rrc mc=+D () m 332 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11 Figure 11.3.

The total weight of cake is related to the total volume of filtrate by (11.3) Substituting eqs. 11.2 and 11.3 into eq. 11.1 with constant Ayields (11.4) Integration of eq. 11.4 from V=0 to V=Vand t=0 to t=tyields (11.5) where Equation 11.5 is known as the Ruth equation for constant-pressure filtration and can be rearranged to give (11.6) A plot of t/Vversus Vyields a straight line with a slope of 1/ Kand intercept of 2 V0/K, as depicted in Fig. 11.4. The values for rmand aare calculated from experimentally deter- mined values of Kand V0. In a rotating drum filter (Fig. 11.3), the drum rotates at a constant speed ( nrps) and only a fraction of drum-surface area is immersed in suspension reservoir ( j). The period of time during which filtration is carried out is j/nper revolution of the drum. Equation 11.5 can be rewritten in this case as (11.7) where V\u00a2=filtrate volume per unit time (volume/time) and V\u00a2/nrepresents the volume of filtrate filtered for one revolution of the drum. This analysis of filtration is based on several assumptions; the primary one is an in- compressible cake which results in constant specific cake resistance. Usually, fermenta- tion cakes are compressible, so avaries with Dp. The concentration of filter aid (1% to 5%) also has a significant effect on specific cake resistance. As depicted in Fig. 11.5, theV nV 333ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 333specific cake resistance decreases as the concentration of filter aid increases. The filter- ability of fermentation broth is also affected by fermentation conditions. The pH, viscos-ity, and composition of the medium affect the cake resistance. Figure 11.6 depicts theeffect of pH on cake resistance. Specific cake resistance decreases with decreasing pH.The coagulation of mycelial protein with heat treatment improves the filterability of the 334 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11 Figure 11.4.

The duration of fermenta- tion also affects filterability and antibiotic activity in penicillin fermentations and repre-sents an example of the interplay of upstream processing (e.g., fermentation) withdownstream processing. Fermentation times of 180 to 200 h are used in penicillin fermen-tations to minimize the cake resistance and maximize antibiotic activity. Typical filtrationconditions for streptomycin fermentations are pH =3.6, 2% to 3% filter aid, following a heat treatment of 30 to 60 min at T=80 to 90\u00b0C. Cell separation can also be accomplished by cross-flow filtration using ultrafil- tration or microporous filtration. These systems are described in more detail in Sec-tion 11.4.8. This technique has achieved rather rapid acceptance and has replaced cen-trifugation and vacuum filtration in many applications. Cross-flow filtration is well suitedto the removal of dispersed cells such as E. coli and yeast. Microporous filters with pores of 0.02 and 0.2 mm are useful for bacterial separations, while larger sizes 0.2 to 2 mm can be used with yeast.

Centrifugation Centrifugation is used to separate particles of size between 100 and 0.1 mm from liquid by centrifugal forces. The theory of solid-liquid separations in a gravitational field should beclearly understood before centrifugal and gravity separations such as sedimentation arecovered. Particle settling in a high-particle-density suspension is known as hindered set- tling, which resembles solid-liquid separations in a centrifugal field.VV V K t KA C p g V r A Ccm2 02 0 22+= = = ,( / ) 7 1 0 15 1 0 298 23 1 044 2 22 42KK pKC Aggkg kg s pccm f. , . /min Products Chap. 11ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 336The major forces acting on a solid particle settling in a liquid by gravitational forces are gravitational force ( FG), drag force ( FD), and buoyant force ( FB).

The analysis presented so far is valid only for dilute cell suspensions where particle- particle interactions are negligible. When particle concentration is high, particles interactto form a swarm, and their terminal velocity decreases from U 0to U. This is known as hindered settling . The separation of cells or particles in a centrifugal field is similar to hin- dered settling under gravity, since particle concentration is high under centrifugation con-ditions. In hindered settling, the drag force on particles is (11.18) where Uis the terminal velocity of the particles under hindered-settling conditions, Lis the average distance between adjacent particles, and b 0is the hindered-settling coefficient. b0is 1.6 for a rectangular arrangement of particles. In dilute solutions, since Dp/L<<1, F\u00a2Dapproaches FD. Hindered settling becomes important when Dpand Lare comparable.

When designing or sizing a centrifuge, we are concerned primarily with the capac- ity of the centrifuge to handle a given flow rate of broth. If we know both the velocity ofthe particle in the centrifugal field and the distance the particle must travel to be captured,then we can proceed with the design. Examples of two popular centrifuges are shown in Fig. 11.7. Clearly, the geometry of the centrifuge influences the travel distance.

Cross-flow microfiltration processes (Section 11.4.8) have replaced centrifugation in many bioprocesses, particularly when it is essential to prevent the escape of cells intothe atmosphere. This consideration is particularly relevant when the organism is geneti-cally modified. 11.2.3. Coagulation and Flocculation Coagulation and flocculation are usually used to form cell aggregates before centrifu- gation, gravity settling, or filtration to improve the performance of these separationprocesses. Coagulation is the formation of small flocs from dispersed colloids using coag-ulating agents, which are usually simple electrolytes. Flocculation is the agglomeration ofthese small flocs into larger settlable particles using flocculating agents, which are usuallypolyelectrolytes or certain salts, such as CaCl 2. Simple electrolytes used in coagulation are acids, bases, salts, and multivalent ions, which are relatively inexpensive, but less effective than polyelectrolytes. Certain fine solidparticles, such as clays, activated carbon, or silica, may serve as nucleation sites for coag-ulation. Polyelectrolytes used in flocculation are can be either anionic, cationic, or nonionic. The analysis of gravity sedimentation is based on Stokes's and Newton's laws and is similar to the analysis presented in the centrifugation section. Sedimentation is a criticalfeature in the activated waste-treatment process and has been applied in some schemes tostabilize a population of genetically engineered cells. A list of widely used flocculants andtheir dosage ranges is given in Table 11.1. The important parameters to be consideredin flocculation are flocculant-coagulant 41 42 22 12 and Purification of Products Chap. 11ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 340kinetics of the binding, and settling phenomena. The selection criteria usually are floccu- lation-sedimentation rate, floc size, and the clarity of the supernatant liquid. 11.3. CELL DISRUPTION After cells are separated from liquid broth, if the desired product is intracellular, then the cells need to be disrupted to release the intracellular products. The method of disruptionvaries with the type of cells and the nature of intracellular products. Major methods of celldisruption can be classified as mechanical and nonmechanical. With small bacteria, effi-cient, large-capacity cell-disruption processes can be difficult to construct. 11.3.1. Mechanical Methods Mechanical methods can be applied to a liquid or solid medium. First, consider some methods applied to a liquid medium. Ultrasonic vibrators (sonicators) are used to disrupt the cell wall and membrane of bacterial cells. Wave density is usually around 20 kc/s. Rods are broken more readily thancocci, and gram-negative cells more easily than gram-positive cells. This method is not aseffective for molds. An electronic generator is used to generate ultrasonic waves, and atransducer converts these waves into mechanical oscillations by a titanium probe im-mersed in a cell suspension. Intracellular compounds (enzymes, metabolites) are releasedinto the broth upon cell disruption. Ultrasonic disruption in some cases results in denatu-ration of sensitive enzymes and fragmentation of cell debris. Heat dissipation is an impor-tant problem in cell disintegration, particularly if the volume subjected to sonication islarge. Consequently this method is used primarily at the laboratory scale. The Gaulin-Manton and French presses work well on a laboratory scale. The French press is a hollow cylinder in a stainless-steel block that is filled with cell paste and Sec. 11.3 Cell Disruption 341TABLE 11.1 Flocculant Dosages Flocculant dose [g (100 g wt)-1] Hydro- Glucose carbon Resuspended Penicillin Dilute Agent Anionic polyelectrolytes polyelectrolytes Polyethylene imine 10 7.0 2.0 20.0 0.6 Inorganic coagulants 0.045-4.5 With permission, from B. Atkinson F. Mavituna, Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology Handbook , Macmil- York, 1983.ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 341subjected to a high pressure. The cylinder has a needle valve at the base, and the cells dis- rupt as they are extruded through the valve to atmospheric pressure. The Ribi fractionatoris similar to a French press but is capable of continuous operation. It requires a preconcen-trated cell paste or slurry. The Rannie high-pressure homogenizer is advertised to operateup to 1000 bar and to have a capacity of up to 40,000 l/h. Other mechanical homogenizers make use of small beads (20 to 50 mesh). Some of these can be effectively used at rather large scales. The Dyno-Mill is available in sizes upto 275 l and can process 2000 kg/h of a cell suspension or about 340 kg dw/h of yeast.The Dyno-Mill can work with algae, bacteria, and fungi. The principle of operation is topump the cell suspension through a horizontal grinding chamber filled with about 80%beads. Within the grinding chamber is a shaft with specially designed discs. When rotatedat high speeds, high shearing and impact forces from millions of beads break cell walls.The broken cells are then discharged. A primary advantage of bead over pressure devicesis better temperature control. Also this device is fully enclosed, preventing release of or-ganisms in an aerosol, which is a critical consideration with pathogenic or geneticallymodified organisms. For a solid medium, such as frozen cell paste or cells attached to or within a solid matrix, different processing options are available. Ball mills can be operated onlarge-scale processes. More specialized pieces of equipment include the Hughes andX-presses. The Hughes press consists of a split block with a half-cylinder hollowed ineach face. The frozen cell paste is placed in the hollow, and pressure is applied to it fromthe cylinder into channels cut in the block. In the X-press, frozen cells are forced continu-ously through a small hole in a disc between two cylinders at low temperature and pres-sure. Cell disruption takes place because of deformation of organisms embedded in theice. Pressure levels of several hundred bars can be obtained with the X-press. With any of these approaches there is potential for damage to the product. Clearly heat denaturation is a major potential problem. The release of proteases from cellular compart-ments can lead to enzymatic degradation of the product. Some techniques, such as beadmills, have comparatively long residence times, so that if 100% cell breakage is desired,some fragile compounds released early in the process may be damaged. Once cell breakageoccurs, products are released and encounter an oxidizing environment (due to air) that cancause, for protein products, rapid denaturation and aggregation. Typically this effect can bemitigated by addition of a reducing agent (e.g., b-mercaptoethanol) and a chelating agent (e.g., EDTA) to complex metal ions that may accelerate the oxidation process. Product qual-ity considerations are essential to selection of a method for cell breakage. 11.3.2 Nonmechanical MethodsOsmotic shock and rupture with ice crystals are commonly used methods. By slowly freezing and then thawing a cell paste, the cell wall and membrane may be broken, releas-ing enzymes into the media. Changes in the osmotic pressure of the medium may result inthe release of certain enzymes, particularly periplasmic proteins in gram-negative cells. Cell-wall preparation of certain organisms can be made by heat-shocking. Freeze-dryingafter treatment with acetone, butanol, and buffers results in cell-wall disruption. 342 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11The periplasmic space in a gram-negative cell is the space between the inner and outer membranes.ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 342Enzymes such as lysozyme (a carbohydrase) can be used to lyse cell walls of bacte- ria. Gram-positive bacteria are far more susceptible to enzymatic lysis than gram-negativebacteria. The cells may be treated with EDTA or by freezing and thawing before treatmentwith lysozyme. (EDTA) will extract divalent ions that are part of the cell envelope. Enzymatic hydrolysisis an expensive method and is not very widely used in industry. Actively growing cells can be treated with an antibiotic, such as penicillin or cy- closerine, that interferes with cell-wall synthesis and, coupled with the correct osmoticconditions, can lead to cell disruption. After cells have been lysed and the products are released into the medium, cell de- bris can be separated by ultracentrifugation or ultrafiltration, and soluble products are re-covered using the following methods. 11.4. SEPARATION OF SOLUBLE PRODUCTS Most microbial products, such as antibiotics, organic acids, solvents, amino acids, and ex- tracellular enzymes, are soluble and extracellular. Various methods have been developedto recover such soluble products, including extraction, adsorption, ultrafiltration, andchromatography. 11.4.1. Liquid-Liquid ExtractionLiquid extraction is commonly used to separate inhibitory fermentation products such as ethanol and acetone-butanol from a fermentation broth. Antibiotics are also recovered byliquid extraction (using amylacetate or isoamylacetate). Ideally, the liquid extractantshould be nontoxic, selective, inexpensive, and immiscible with fermentation broth andshould have a high distribution coefficient for the product. The extraction of a compound from one phase to the other is based on solubility dif- ferences of the compound in one phase relative to the other. When a compound is distrib-uted between two immiscible liquids, the ratio of the concentrations in the two phases isknown as the distribution coefficient: (11.27) where Y Land XHare concentrations of the solute in light and heavy phases, respectively. In most, but certainly not all cases, the light phase will be the organic solvent and theheavy phase will be the aqueous fermentation broth. Assuming that K Dis constant and the solvents are totally immiscible (that is, the mass flows of the light and heavy phases are conserved so that L0=L1=Land H0=H1=H), a mass balance on the extracted solute yields (Fig. 11.8a) (11.28) PM Page as (11.30) E=LKD/His the extraction factor.

Figure 11.9 depicts the relationship between E, Xn/X0, and n, which is used to determine the number of stages ( n) required for a certain degree of extraction ( Xn/X0) for a given system ( E). Most antibiotics are extracted from the fermentation broth by using solvents such as amylacetate or isoamylacetate. Usually, continuous centrifugal Podbielniak extractors are used for the extraction of antibiotics. Penicillin is more soluble in organic phase at lowpHs (pH =2 to 3) and is highly soluble in aqueous phase at high pHs (pH =8 to 9). There- fore, penicillin is extracted between organic and aqueous phases several times by shiftingthe pH to improve the purity of the product. Figure 11.10 depicts the variation of distribu-tion coefficient (solvent-aqueous) with pH in penicillin extraction by amylacetate. Some products to be recovered from the fermentation broth are weak acids or weak bases. Since compounds that are not ionized are soluble in the organic phase, the pH con-ditions are selected such that the extracted compound is neutral and is soluble in an or-ganic solvent. Therefore, weak bases are extracted at high pHs and weak acids areextracted at low pH values in the neutral form. If fermentation broth contains more than one component, then the selectivity ( b) of the solvent becomes an important parameter. The selectivity coefficient ( b ij) is defined as (11.35) The ease of separation depends on the bijvalue: the higher the bijvalue is, the easier the separation of ifrom j. In some cases, the bijvalue changes appreciably with a pH shift andbiji jK K= Sec. 11.4 Separation of Soluble Products 345 Figure 11.9.

For example, at low pH values, penicillins can be separated from other impurities by selective extraction into the organic solvent. How-ever, the separation of similar compounds by extraction is difficult. If only nonionizedspecies are soluble in both phases at extreme pH values and the solvents are immiscible,the aforementioned design equations can be used. However, at intermediate pH values,when compounds are partially ionized, the analysis of the system becomes more compli-cated. The extraction of ionized species (weak acid or bases) is known as dissociation extraction .

A particularly important device for liquid-liquid extraction for fermentation prod- ucts is the Podbielniak centrifugal extractor (see Fig. 11.11). Many fermentation productsare unstable (e.g., penicillin). The use of mixer-settlers can be problematic, because theresidence time of the product in the pH-adjusted broth is too long. The rapid rotation ofthe Podbielniak extractor produces a centrifugal field that rapidly drives the two fluidscountercurrent to each other, as depicted in Fig. 11.11. A product can be extracted and re-turned to another aqueous phase (e.g., a phosphate buffer) within minutes. Example 11.2. Penicillin is extracted from a fermentation broth using isoamylacetate as the organic solvent in a continuous countercurrent cascade extraction unit. The flow rates of organic ( L) and aqueous ( H) phases are L=10 H =100 l/min, respectively. The distribution coeffi- cient of penicillin between organic and aqueous phases at pH =3 is KD=YL/XH=50. If the penicillin concentration in the feed stream is 20 g/l, determine the number of stages requiredto reduce the penicillin concentration to 0.1 g/l in the effluent of the extraction unit. Solution Using Fig. 11.9, we can obtain n=4. If a Podbielniak centrifugal extractor were used, it would have to correspond to four ideal stages.ELK H X XD n== = == \u00a5-() () () .10 50 1005 01 2051 0 03 Sec. 11.4 Separation of Soluble Products 347 Figure 11.11.

Aqueous T wo-phase Extraction Aqueous two-phase extraction is an approach under active development for the extraction of soluble proteins such as enzymes between two aqueous phases containing incompatiblepolymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran. The phases containing PEGand dextran are more than 75% water and are immiscible. Typical aqueous phases usedfor this purpose are PEG-water/dextran-water and PEG-water/K-phosphate-water.PEG/dextran and PEG/K phosphate are reasonably immiscible. The partition coefficient,K p, varies with the molecular weight (MW) of the soluble protein in the form of an expo- nential function. (11.38) where Mis the MW of protein, Tis the absolute temperature, and Ais a constant. The partition coefficient, Kp, of many enzymes between the two phases ( CPEG-CDEX) varies between 1 and 3.7, resulting in poor separations in a single stage. The partitioncoefficient can be improved by including ion-exchange resins or certain salts, such as(NH 4)2SO4and KH2PO4, in one of the phases. Figure 11.12 depicts the variation of Kpof an enzyme with a concentration of KH2PO4in a PEG/(NH4)2SO4system. More than ten- fold increases in Kpvalues may be achieved by increasing the concentration of KH2PO4 from 0.1 to 0.3 M. In PEG-salt systems, salting-out may result in protein precipitation at the interface. Ion-exchange resins can be used to increase the value of a partition coefficient. PEG can be derivatized to yield cation or anion exchange properties and used in a two-phaseKepAM T=/ 348 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11 Figure 11.12. The expected behavior of an enzyme in a two-phase solution is depicted.Note the dependence of the partition coeffi-cient of a hypothetical protein on the con-centration of potassium phosphate in apolyethylene glycol 4000 ammonium sul-phate system. A typical condition would be14% PEG 4000 and 9.5% (NH 4)2SO4.ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 348system. Affinity ligands may also be used to increase Kpvalues; examples are PEG-NADH and PEG-cibacron blue systems. This method is known as two-aqueous- phase affinity partition extraction. Also, partial hydrolysis of dextran and PEG may result in an increase in the Kpvalue, since lower-MW polymers may interact with proteins more effectively. By mixing two kinds of PEGs (PEG400and PEG4000), the Kpvalue may be in- creased by a factor of 6 for the partition of fumarase. Two-aqueous-phase extraction canalso be used for the recovery of cell debris, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. The parti-tion coefficient for whole cells and DNA is between 100 and 0.01, for proteins it is be-tween 10 and 0.1, and for small ions it is around 1. After the extraction step, the phases can be separated by centrifugation or decanta- tion, and PEG can be recovered by ultrafiltration. Figure 11.13 is a block diagram of anenzyme separation unit using the two-phase partitioning method with PEG recovery. Thisseparation method is fast and can be operated under mild conditions of temperature, pres-sure, and pH. Dextran and PEG are recovered and reused, since the cost of polymers is themajor economic factor. 11.4.3. PrecipitationThe first step in the purification of intracellular proteins after cell disruption is usually precipitation. Proteins in a fermentation broth (before or after cell lysis) can be separated from other components by precipitation using certain salts. Examples include strepto-mycin sulfate and ammonium sulfate. The two major methods used for protein precipitation are as follows: 1.Salting-out by adding inorganic salts such as (NH 4)2SO4at high ionic strength. 2.Solubility reduction at low temperatures by adding organic solvents ( T<-5\u00b0). Salting-out of proteins is achieved by increasing the ionic strength of a protein-con- taining solution by adding salts such as (NH4)2SO4or Na2SO4. The added ions interact with water more strongly, causing protein molecules to precipitate. The solubility of pro-teins in a solution as a function of the ionic strength of the solution is given by (11.39) log ( )S SKIS 0=- \u00a2 Sec. 11.4 Separation of Soluble Products 349 Figure 11.13.

The ionic strength of a solution is defined as (11.40) where Ciis molar concentration of the ionic species (mol/l), and Ziis the charge (valence) on ions. Figure 11.14 depicts variation of the solubility of hemoglobin with inorganic salt concentrations. At high ionic strengths, the solubility of the protein decreases logarithmi-cally with ionic strength. Organic solvent addition at low temperatures ( T<-5C) causes the precipitation of proteins by reducing the dielectric constant of the solution. The solubility of protein as afunction of the dielectric constant of a solution is given by (11.41) where D Sis the dielectric constant of the water-solvent solution. A reduction in the dielectric constant of a solution results in stronger electrostatic forces between the protein molecules and facilitates protein precipitation. The addition ofsolvents also reduces protein-water molecule interactions and therefore decreases proteinsolubility. Solvents may cause protein denaturation. However, denaturation of proteins inthe salting-out method is less likely. Solvent precipitation can be used with salt addition, pH adjustment, and low temperature to improve precipitation. Among other protein pre-cipitation methods, the following methods are the most widely used. Isoelectric precipitation is the precipitation of proteins at their isoelectric point, which is the pH at which proteins have no net charge. The isoelectric point of a protein isdefined as p I=/onenumeratorcentered/twodenominatorcentered(pK 1+pK2). When pH =pI, protein becomes typical protein.ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 350tates. This method is effective for proteins with high surface hydrophobicity (that is, a nonpolar surface). It is inexpensive, but low pH values may result in the denaturation ofproteins. The use of ionic polyelectrolytes, such polyphosphates, and polyacrylic acids, changes the ionic strength of the media and causes protein precipi-tation. However, polyelectrolytes may cause protein denaturation and structural damage. The use of nonionic polymers, such as dextrans and polyethylene glycol, reduces the amount of water available to interact with protein molecules and results in protein pre-cipitation. High concentrations of polymers are most effective for low-MW proteins, andnonionic polymers do not interfere with further protein recovery. 11.4.4. Adsorption Adsorption of solutes from liquid media onto solids is a common practice in separating soluble materials from fermentation broth. Various mechanisms may be involved in ad-sorption. In physical adsorption, weak forces, such as van der Waals forces, are dominant;however, in ion-exchange adsorption, strong ionic bonds are utilized. Solute is transferredfrom liquid to solid phase, and an equilibrium is reached after a while in a batch opera-tion. The type of adsorbent used depends on the particular application. The most widelyused adsorbent for waste-water treatment applications is activated carbon, since it haslarge internal surface area per unit weight. Ion-exchange resins and other polymeric ad-sorbents can be used for protein separations of small organics. For example, a carboxylicacid cation exchange resin is used to recover streptomycin. Adsorption capacity varies de-pending on adsorbent, adsorbate, the surface propertiesof the adsorbent and adsorbate. Usually, the exact mechanism of adsorption is not wellunderstood, and the equilibrium data must be determined experimentally. One typical equilibrium relationship between solute concentrations in liquid and solid phases is (11.42) where C* Land C*Sare equilibrium concentrations of the solute in liquid and solid phases. CSis in units of mass of solute adsorbed per unit volume of resin. This relationship is an example of a type of Freundlich adsorption isotherm, with KFand nbeing empirical para- meters greater than 1. Various types of solid-liquid contactors have been developed for the adsorption of and the most widely used, since the adsorp-tion area per unit volume of reactor is the largest among the others. Analysis of adsorptionphenomena in a packed-bed column is based on a differential material balance of the solu- tion in the column. (11.43) where Uis the superficial velocity of the liquid, ethe porosity of the bed, and C Lthe con- centration the solute in the Soluble Products 351ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 351The first term in eq. 11.43 is the convective transfer of solute in the bed, the second term represents the time course of change (transient) of the solute concentration in liquid,and the last term represents the rate of solute transfer from the liquid to the solid phase. The rate of solute transfer from the liquid into the solid phase is (11.44) where K ais the overall mass transfer coefficient describing the internal and external mass transfer resistance, and C*Lis the concentration of solute in the liquid phase, which is in equilibrium with CS. Substituting eq. 11.44 into eq. 11.43 yields (11.45) Equation 11.45, along equilibrium relationship (eq. 11.42), can be solved numer- ically to determine the solute profile, CL=CL(Z, t), in the column. The preceding approach is based on plug flow conditions in the bed. However, in practice, due to back-mixing and dispersion, irregular flow profiles and channeling occur.A dispersion term [ -D E(2CL/Z2)] is added to the right side of eq. 11.45 to account for dispersion effects. A fixed-bed adsorption unit can be approximated to a large number ofwell-mixed tanks in series. For very long moving-bed columns to which adsorbent is added continuously, the operation may be considered to be at steady state (see Fig. 11.15). For the analysis, equi-librium is assumed to occur at the top of the column. If the dispersion effects are negligi-ble, then at steady state eq. 11.45 can be written as (11.46) 1dC dtKC CS aL L =- *) 352 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11B q = OF C = OB (Withpermission, from D.

Equation 11.46 can be integrated to determine the height of the column for a certain degree of separation. (11.47) By using an equilibrium relationship, we can integrate eq. 11.47 to determine the height of the column. To complete the analysis, a relationship between the unsaturatedresin and the liquid concentration is needed. This relationship is called an operating line (Fig. 11.16) and represents a mass balance. Note that the volumetric resin flow is denotedby Band the volumetric liquid flow rate by F. Also note that (11.48) where Ais the cross-sectional area of the column. From mass balance considerations on the solute, (11.49) or (11.50) where C* S0is the resin concentration of solute in equilibrium with CL0. As noted in Fig. 11.16, the operating line is straight. For fixed-bed columns, the absorptive capacity is limited to a maximum level. In this view, a column would consist of three zones: a saturated zone , an adsorption zone , and a virgin zone . The adsorption zone moves down a column at a rate determined by the feed rate of the solute and the mass transfer characteristics of the bed. When the leadingedge of the adsorption zone reaches the bottom of the column, there will be a rapid in-crease in the exit concentration of solute. Normally, the column would be shut down atthis point and the resin replaced or regenerated. However, if the column were operated fora period of time equal to the time for the adsorption zone to travel its own height, weB () * 10 0 /H9255 Sec. 11.4 Separation of Soluble Products 353 Figure 11.16.

Dialysis Dialysis is a membrane separation operation used for the removal of low-MW solutes such as organic acids (100 <MW <500) and ions (10 <MW <100) from a solution. A well-known example is the use of dialysis membranes to remove urea (MW =60) from urine in artificial kidney (dialysis) devices. In biotechnology dialysis can be used to remove salts from a protein solution, which is often a step in resolubilizing pro-teins that were initially in inclusion bodies. A schematic of a dialysis membrane is de-picted in Fig. 11.18. Note that the membrane is selective. The dialysis membraneseparates two phases containing low-MW and high-MW solutions. Since the MW cutoffof a dialysis membrane is very small, low-MW solutes move from a high- to a low-concentration region. At equilibrium, the chemical potentials of diffusing compounds onboth sides of a membrane are equal. (11.51) where mis the chemical potential of the diffusing compound. In terms of concentrations, eq. 11.51 can be written as (11.52) 11.4 Separation of Soluble Products 355ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 355where C1is the concentration and g1is the activity coefficient of diffusing component 1. For ideal (very dilute) solutions, g1\u00aa 1 and (11.54) The concentrations represented in eqs. 11.51 through 11.54 are concentrations of dis- solved (unbound) component 1. This dialysis equilibrium is based on the assumption of uncharged solute molecules. If macromolecules are polyelectrolytes, such as proteins and nucleic acids, then thecharge equilibrium of the macromolecules needs to be considered. This equilibrium isknown as the Donnan equilibrium. 11.4.6. Reverse Osmosis For fermentation broths, osmosis is the transport of water molecules from a high- to a low-concentration region (i.e., from a pure water phase to a salt-containing aqueousphase) when these two phases are separated by a selective membrane. The water passesthe membrane easily, while the salt does not. At equilibrium, the chemical potential ofwater must be the same on both sides of the membrane. As the water passes into the saltsolution, its pressure increases. This osmotic pressure can be expressed by (11.55) where Cis the concentration of the solute, Tis temperature, Ris the gas constant, and B 2, B3are the virial coefficients for the solute. For very dilute, ideal solutions, B2=B3=0, and (11.56) In reverse osmosis (RO), a pressure is applied onto a salt-containing phase, which drives water (solvent) molecules from a low- to a high-concentration region and results in theconcentration of solute (salt) molecules on one side of the membrane. The pressure re-quired to move solvent from a low- to high-concentration phase is equal to or slightlylarger than the osmotic pressure.

High-MW compo-nent ( D) cannot pass.ch11 some reverse osmosis applications, membranes may allow the passage of solute molecules along with solvent. Solute transport can be by diffusion or convection. A reflec- tion coefficient (s) for each solute can be defined as the fraction of solute molecules re- tained on one side of the membrane in the presence of a solvent flux. Therefore, for s=0, complete solute passage is obtained, and for s=1, no solute passage is achieved (that is, perfect reflection). Solvent and solute fluxes in reverse osmosis can Kpand Kp\u00a2are permeability coefficients for solvent and solute, respectively, Cis the average solute concentration in solution, and DCis the solute concentration difference across the membrane. The magnitude of the required pressure varies with the concentration of solutions. Pressures on the order of 30 to 40 atm are required for a 0.6 Msalt solution. The salt level in fermentation fluids may be much higher than 0.6 M, requiring high pressures for RO separations. The applications of RO in bioseparations are limited, since the method re-quires high pressures and is based on solvent removal. RO membranes are usually usedfor dewatering and concentration purposes, but not for protein separations. Another problem with RO membranes is the deposition of solute molecules on membrane surfaces, resulting in large resistances for solvent flow. This phenomenon,known as concentration polarization, can be overcome by increasing the degree of turbu- lence on the membrane surface. The osmotic pressure for multicomponent systems is equal to the sum of the indi- vidual osmotic pressures: (11.59) pp== + + +\u00c2\u00c2 i ii iii ii CR T B C B C ()1232LSolute: ( ) NC of Soluble Products 357 Figure 11.19.

Membrane separations may beused to separate proteins after precipitation to remove many of the contaminants. Mem-branes can serve as a molecular sieve to separate solute molecules of different molecularsize. Depending on molecular-size cutoff, different membranes can be used for the separa-tion of different MW proteins. Microfiltration ormicroporous filtration (MF) is used to separate species, such as bacteria and yeast, that range from 0.1 to 10 mm in width. Ultra- filters are used for macromolecules with a molecule-weight range of 2000 to 500,000. Allthese membrane sieving methods (microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis) arebased on the same driving force, namely pressure, but have some minor differences. Someultrafiltration (UF) membranes have anisotropic structure . In an anisotropic membrane, a thin skin with small pores is formed on top of a thick, highly porous structure. The thinlayer provides selectivity, while the thicker layer provides mechanical support. Withnewer membrane materials available, anisotropic membranes are used less frequently. Mi- croporous filters are usually isotropic and may have an open, tortuous path structure, which causes particle entrapment within the filter, or may have well-defined pores of uni-form size. While most membranes in use are made from polymers, ceramic membranes have increased in popularity. Factors that affect choice of membrane materials are interactionswith proteins, mechanical stability, chemical stability (especially to cleaning agents), bio-compatibility, flux rates, ease of sterilization (e.g., thermal stability), and cost. Typicalpolymeric materials are cellulose acetate, nylon, polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE), poly-vinyldine difluroide and polysulfone. Ceramic membranes have a high level ofchemical resistance, can be steam sterilized, and have a much longer life time (ca. 10 yr)versus many polymeric membranes. Such membranes have high initial cost and, whilemechanically strong, are sometimes brittle. The actual choice of membrane depends onthe application, the composition of the feed stream, and required product characteristics. UF and MF membranes are widely used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries for the separation of vaccines, fermentation products, enzymes, and other pro-teins. Ultrafiltration is an energy-efficient, economical separation method used to concen-trate chemicals and biologicals at a high degree of purity. Typical UF and MF operations are pressure-driven processes in which low-MW solutes and water pass through the filter and high-MW solutes are retained on the mem-brane surface. Therefore, a concentration gradient builds up between the surface of themembrane and the bulk fluid. This gradient results in concentration polarization. As a re-sult, solute diffuses back from the membrane surface to the solution (Fig. 11.20). Atsteady state, the rate of convective transfer of solute toward membrane is equal to the rateNC NK C iii i p i 5:44 PM Page 358of diffusion of solute in the opposite direction because of concentration polarization.

That is, k\u00b5v0.5for laminar and k\u00b5vfor turbulent flow. A gel layer is formed on the surface of the UF membrane when slowly diffusing large macromolecules accumulate at the surface. A gel layer forms if the protein concen-tration in the solution exceeds 0.1%. For biological fluids, protein accumulation is usuallydominant (Fig. 11.20). The protein concentration in the gel, C G, is the maximum value of CW. In this case, the liquid flux through the filter is given by (11.66) Gel formation depends on the nature and concentration of the solute, pH, and pressure. Once gel is formed, CGbecomes constant, and liquid flux decreases logarithmically with increasing solute concentration in the bulk liquid. The gel layer causes a hydraulic resis-tance against flow and acts somewhat like a second membrane. Figure 11.21 depicts thevariation of liquid flux with the log of solute concentration in the absence and presence ofgel formation. 11.4.8 Cross-flow Ultrafiltration and Microfiltration Gel formation can be partially eliminated by cross-flow filtration , where pressure is not applied directly perpendicular to the membrane, but parallel to the membrane surface.This process is also called tangential flow filtration. That is, fluid flows parallel to the membrane surface and passes through the membrane, leaving solutes in a liquid phaseabove the membrane. Mechanical agitation or vibration of the membrane surface can alsobe used to alleviate gel formation. A schematic of cross-flow filtration is shown in Fig. 11.22. The pressure drop driv- ing Purification of Products Chap. 11 Figure 11.21.

For turbulent flow, the following equation is used for DP: (11.69) where fis the Fanning friction factor, which is a function of Re. For cross-flow filtration, turbulent flow is desired. The average transmembrane pressure drop is (11.70) where Pfis the filtrate pressure, which is usually near atmospheric pressure. Assuming that Pf=Patmor Pfis zero gauge pressure, we can relate DPMto DP. (11.71) High inlet pressure and low fluid velocities need to be used to obtain high DPM. The filtration flux ( J), as a function of transmembrane pressure drop, is given by (11.72) where RGand RMare gel and membrane resistances, respectively. RMis constant and RG varies with the solute concentration and the tangential velocity across the membrane, which can retard or eliminate gel formation. Also, the filtration flux ( J) is a function of fluid velocity, as described by eqs. 11.71 and 11.72. Usually, there is an optimal fluid ve-locity range maximizing the filtration rate. At low velocities, the mass transfer coefficient(k) is low, resulting in high gel resistance ( R G) and low filtrate flux. At high fluid veloci- ties, DPis high, resulting in low DPMand therefore low Jvalues. Also, there is an optimal value of DPMresulting in maximum flux. This is because of a maximum-pressure limita- tion on Pi. That is, the maximum value of DPMis Pi, and Piis limited by the physical properties of the membrane. With modern membranes, especially the new = =01 22 4Dmm 11.4 Separation of cross-flow filtration.ch11 10/11/01 5:44 361branes, it may be possible to push Pito high levels. Therefore, at low DPMvalues, flux in- creases with DPM; however, at high DPMvalues, filtration flux drops as a result of the de- crease in velocity. Figure 11.23 describes optimal values of DPMresulting in the maximum UF or MF rate for various solute concentrations. In the absence of gel formation, the filtration flux increases linearly with DPM. Fig- ure 11.24 depicts the variation of filtration flux ( J) with DPM. At low DPMvalues, Jin- creases linearly with DPMbecause of the absence of gel polarization. However, at high DPM, gel formation takes place, and gel resistance ( RG) increases with increasing DPM, re- sulting in a constant filtration flux ( J) over a large range of high DPMvalues. At higher solute concentrations, flux levels off at lower DPMvalues. The rejection coefficient of an ultrafilter is defined as (11.73) where CFis the concentration of the solute in the filtrate. When CF=0, only water passes through the filter and R =1, which is complete solute rejection. If CF=CB, complete solute transfer to the filtrate takes place and R=0 (no rejection). Usually, 0 <R<1 and is closer to 1 (i.e., R \u00aa0.95 or 0.98). The value of Ris a measure of the selectivity of the membrane for certain solutes. Selective separations of various compounds can beachieved using membranes with the right molecular-weight cutoff.

Three major membrane configurations are depicted in Fig. 11.26: hollow fibers, flat sheets, and spiral-wound cartridges. Fiber cartridges provide a large surface-to-volumeratio. However, they plug more easily than the other two configurations. Flat-plate config-urations are easy to construct and allow easy membrane replacement. The channel widthcan be altered to reduce plugging problems. Membrane support must be added to allowoperation at higher pressures. Flat-plate systems have a low membrane surface-to-volumeratio. Spiral cartridges contain rolled membranes and are essentially flat-plate systemsconfigured to increase the surface-to-volume ratio. Most UF membranes operate with DP<5 to 7 bars and MF membranes at a slightly lower DP. Sec. 11.4 Separation of Soluble Productsd 363 Figure 11.24.

In concentration, water is removed from the aqueous solution of solute using anUF membrane, and solute is concentrated. In purification, solvent and low-MW productsare separated from high-MW compounds using a UF membrane. The product containslow-MW compounds and the solvent. In diafiltration, low-MW solutes such as salts, sug-ars, and alcohols pass through the filter, and the retained stream contains the product. Thepermeate that leaves the system is replaced with deionized water. Ultrafiltration membranes are used for the separation of proteins, enzymes, pyro- gens (lipopolysaccharides from bacterial cell wall), cell debris, and viruses from fermen-tation media. Ultrafiltration is usually the second step in protein recovery after protein 364 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11 Figure 11.26. Examples of different membrane configurations.

UF separations conditions ( T=20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C, P =5 to 50 psi) and are energy efficient, inexpensive, nondestructive, and easy to operate. Microfiltration is used primarily to concentrate bacterial and yeast suspensions and provide a cell-free supernatant. Cross-flow filtration and improved membranes have beenkey to making this process viable. In many applications it has replaced centrifugation. Ini-tial devices were primarily open plate and frame, owing to possible blockages, althoughhollow-fiber systems are now available. Application to animal cells, which are mechani-cally fragile, is possible but difficult, owing to high levels of hydrodynamic sheer that canbreak cells. 11.4.9. ChromatographyChromatography separates mixtures into components by passing a fluid mixture through a bed of adsorbent material. We will be interested primarily in elution chromatography . Typically a column is packed with adsorbent particles, which may be solid, a porous solid,a gel, or a liquid phase immobilized in or on a solid. A mobile phase or fluid phase with a mixture of solutes is injected. This pulse is followed by a solvent or eluent. The pulse en-ters as a narrow concentrated peak, but exits dispersed and diluted by additional solvent.Different solutes in the mixture interact differently with the adsorbent material ( stationary phase ); some interact weakly and some interact strongly. Solutes that interact weakly with the matrix pass out of the column rapidly (see Fig. 11.27), while those that interactstrongly with the matrix exit slowly. These differential rates of migration separate the Sec. 11.4 Separation of Soluble Products 365Increasing Time Solute Retention Time Figure 11.27. Concentrations in elution chromatography. Three solutes, shownschematically as circles, squares, and trian-gles, are injected into one end of a packedbed. When solvent flows through the bedfrom left to right, the three solutes move atdifferent rates because of different adsorp-tion. They exit at different times, and henceare separated.

Hu,Bioseparations: Downstream Processing for Biotechnology , John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1988, p. 184.)ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 365solutes into different peaks that exit at a characteristic retention time (which will change if operating conditions are altered). Elution chromatography is similiar to fixed-bed adsorption (Section chromatography) solute is cap-tured in the adsorbent and then eluted as a concentrate. In elution chromatography youpurify the product even while it is being diluted. When large amounts of material are being processed, displacement chromatography may be attractive. In this method the column is subjected to sequential step changes ininlet conditions (e.g., nature of solvent). In this method the feed mixture is introduced,followed by a constant infusion of displacer solution. The displacer must have a higheraffinity for the stationary phase than any compound in the feed solution. The displacer\"pushes\" solute off the stationary phase and back into the mobile phase. If conditions arechosen correctly, the feed components are forced into adjacent square-wave-like zones ofconcentrated, pure solutes. These zones then break through the end of the columnwith the zone having the solute with the lowest affinity for the stationary phase exitingfirst. The primary advantage of displacement chromatography over elution chromatogra-phy is the potential for higher throughput, but operation is more difficult, and high resolu- tion(separation of solutes) can be difficult to obtain in some situations. These chromatographic processes are almost always run as batch operations, al- though schemes for continuous or semicontinuous operation have been proposed. For theremainder of our discussion we focus on elution chromatography as a batch process.Some important types of chromatographic methods are: 1.Adsorption chromatography (ADC) is based on the adsorption of solute molecules onto solid particles, such as alumina and silica gel, by weak van der Waals forcesand steric interactions. 2.Liquid-liquid partition chromatography (LLC) is based on the different partition coefficients (solubility) of solute molecules between an adsorbed liquid phase solution. Often the adsorbed liquid is nonpolar. 3.Ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) is based on the adsorption of ions (or electri- cally charged compounds) on particles by electrostatic forces. 4.Gel-filtration (molecular sieving) chromatography is based on the penetration of solute molecules into small pores of packing particles on the basis of molecular size and theshape of the solute molecules. It is also known as size exclusion chromatography. 5.Affinity chromatography (AFC) is based on the specific chemical interactions be- tween solute molecules and ligands (a functional molecule covalently linked to asupport particle). Ligand-solute interaction is very specific, such as enzyme-substrate interaction, which may depend on covalent, ionic forces or hydrogen-bondformation. Affinity binding may be molecular size and shape specific. 6.Hydrophobic chromatography (HC) is based on hydrophobic interactions between solute molecules (e.g., proteins) and functional groups (e.g., alkyl residues) on sup-port particles. This method is a type of reverse phase chromatography which re- quires that the stationary phase is less polar than the mobile phase. 7.High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) is based on the general principles of chromatography, the only difference being high liquid pressure applied to the 366 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 366packed column. Owing to high-pressure liquid (high liquid flow rate) and dense col- umn packing, HPLC provides fast and high resolution of solute molecules. The choice of the stationary phase and consequently the type of chromatography depends on the nature of the solutes and process goals. Ion-exchange chromatography iswidely used, particularly for recovery of proteins. This method offers good resolution ofpeaks, high capacity, and good speed. Hydrophobic chromatography and LLC share manyof these attributes, but are best applied when the aqueous phase is at high ionic strength.Also organic solvents may be needed, which may denature proteins or create environmen-tal problems. Adsorption chromatography is often relatively inexpensive, but resolution isoften not very sharp. Gel-filtration chromatography is good for buffer exchange and de-salting and offers decent resolution. Because gels are compressible, capacity and through-put are often low; new rigid packings for size exclusion chromatography allow faster flowrates. Affinity methods offer the possibility of very high selectivity and good capacity andspeed. However, such methods can be extremely expensive, especially if based on anti-bodies. For real bioprocesses (e.g., recovery of proteins) multiple types of chromatogra-phy are used, since greater purity is possible if more than one basis of separation is used.Ion-exchange and affinity chromatography are the most widely used methods to recoverproteins from bioprocesses. A single chromatographic separation process may include more than one of these mechanisms. For example, adsorption chromatography using silica gel functions properlywhen the water content of silica gel is less than 15%. The system may operate asliquid-liquid partition chromatography when the water content exceeds 30%. In somecases, electrostatic and weak forces may be simultaneously functional. A typical chromatographic column is shown in Fig. 11.28, where a solution is flow- ing downward in the column and a solute is adsorbed on adsorbent solids by forming a Sec. 11.4 Separation of Soluble Products 367 Figure 11.28. Schematic of a chromatog- raphy column.ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 367band. The solvent carries the solute downward as it moves along the axis of the column. It is assumed that a rapid equilibrium is established between the solute and adsorbent andthat radial gradients are negligible. Assume that a small volume of solvent, DV, is poured through the band, which car- ries the adsorbed solute downward in the column. A material balance on solute over a dif-ferential column height of DXyields (11.74) where C\u00a2 Sis the amount of adsorbed solute per unit volume of column. Further simplifica- tion of eq. 11.74 yields (11.75) In the simplest case, the amount of solute adsorbed per unit volume of column is closely related to the adsorption isotherm of the solute. (11.76) where Mis amount of adsorbent per unit volume of column (mg/ml) and f(CL) is the ad- sorption isotherm or amount of adsorbed solute per unit amount of absorbent, which is afunction of C L. By substituting the derivative of eq. 11.76 into eq. 11.75, Since e, and Mare constants, DXis determined by f\u00a2(CL), which is the derivative of f(CL), or the adsorption isotherm. That is, the location of the solute band formed is mainly determined by the adsorption characteristics of a particular solute on an adsorbent. Whenthe solvent contains two components, Iand J, the solutes form two distinct bands at differ- ent axial distances, depending on their adsorption characteristics (see Fig. 11.29). If we define L Ias the distance traveled by solute I, LSas the distance traveled by sol- vent above the adsorption column ( DV/A), and LCas the penetration distance of the sol-DDXV AM f CL=+\u00a2[( ) ]/H9255 solute removal in void D D D D Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 368vent into the column ( DV/Ae), then the resolution ( R) or the ratio of the distance traveled by solute Ito that of solvent in the space above the column is given by (11.80) where K =f\u00a2(CL) =df(CL)/dCL=partition coefficient. Similarly, we can define Rfas (11.81) where Rfis the ratio of the travel distance of Ito that of solvent in the column. When component Iis moved out of the column, then LI=L0and LS=V0/A, where V0is the volume of solvent required to displace out of the packed column. Then LS/LI becomes (11.82) where Vris the ratio of solvent volume to column volume. This theory of chromatography is applicable to fixed column adsorption, partition, ion-exchange, and affinity chromatography. The theory of gel-filtration different. In gel-filtration (molecular sieving) chromatography, solute mole-cules diffuse into porous structures of support particles, depending on their molecular sizeand shape. Small solute molecules get into the fine pore structures of the support particlesand remain in contact with the solid for a \"long\" period, while large molecules are ad-sorbed on the outer surface and remain in contact with the solid for a \"short\" period.When the column is eluted, the largest molecules appear first in the eluent solvent, and thesmallest molecules last. Different bands of solute molecules are obtained on the basis oftheir size and shape. Consider the case where a buffer with the solutes of interest is addedto the column, followed by sufficient washes to elute the original buffer solution. The total volume of the buffer solution eluted from the column over a certain period of Soluble Products 369Liquid Adsorbent t = O t = t fLiquid AdsorbentLX LOLCX Y=V A LS=V A X + Y Figure 11.29.

For large molecules that do not penetrate inside the gel structure, KD=0; for small molecules that completely penetrate inside the gel, KD=1. Equation 11.83 can be rewrit- ten as (11.84) For a given solute mixture and gel beads, KDand the Vi/V0ratio are fixed, and the Ve/V0 ratio is approximately constant, irrespective of column geometry and Ve. Gel-filtration chromatography can be used to determine the molecular weight of macromolecules. A plot of Ve/V0versus log (MW) yields a straight line with a negative slope that is proportional with KD. Affinity chromatography is based on the highly specific interaction between solute molecules and ligands attached on polymeric or ceramic beads in a packed column. Theconcept of affinity chromatography is described in Fig. 11.30. The matrix is usuallyagarose. However, polyacrylamide, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, cellulose, and porousglass can also be used as the matrix bead. Spacer arms between the matrix and ligand areusually linear aliphatic hydrocarbons. The use of spacer arms may reduce the steric hin-drance generated by the matrix. Coupling between the matrix and ligand depends on thefunctional groups present on the matrix and ligand. Chemically reactive groups on thesupport matrix usually are \u2014OH,\u2014NH 2, or \u2014COOH groups. If the reactive group on the matrix is \u2014OH group (polysaccharides, glass, hydroxyalkyl methacrylate), thencyanogen cyanogen bromide-activatedagarose reacts with primary amine groups present in proteins that act as ligands. After thedesired solutes are bound to the ligand, elution is achieved by changing the pH or ionicstrength in the column.

In the adsorption step, only thosemolecules with a specific binding site for theligand bind to the adsorbent; moleculeswithout the proper geometric fit passthrough unaffected.

That is, an enzyme inhibitor or substrate may be used as a ligand in separating a specific enzymefrom a mixture. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) may be used as a ligand to separate spe-cific antigen molecules by affinity chromatography. Another type of affinity chromatography is IMAC (immobilized-metal-affinity chro- matography) which exploits the that solutes (esp. proteins) have formetal ions chelated to a support surface. A very attractive feature is the low cost of metalsand the ease of regeneration of the stationary phase, particularly in contrast to affinitychromatography using antibodies. Typically, iminodiacetic acid (IDA) or nitrilotriaceticacid (NTA) linked to an agarose or silica gel support provide attachment sites for a metalion. A variety of target proteins have been purified using zinc, copper, and nickel chelates.Water molecules will normally solvate metal ions, but in the presence of a strong Lewisbase (e.g., histidine residue in a protein) the water molecules can be displaced. The bondsthat form between the immobilized metal and the base (protein) result in an adsorbed pro-tein. Factors such as the accessibility, microenvironment of the binding residue (i.e., histi-dine, cystein, and tryptophan), cooperation between neighboring amino acid side groups,and local conformations play important roles in the strength of binding and thus proteinretention. Subsequent destruction of the bond by lowering the pH or adding a competingligand in the mobile phase results in the elution of the metal binding protein. Not all proteins naturally bind metals. However, IMAC can still be used if the ge- netic information for the desired protein is altered to include a tailthat has high metal- binding affinity. Typically the structural gene encoding the target protein is extended tocode for a metal-binding peptide, resulting in production of a fusion protein of the targetprotein and tail. The amino acid sequence of the tail is based on a sequence of amino acidsknown to bind metals. A common choice is six adjacent histidines. Peptide libraries havealso been used to generate effective affinity tails. The biggest drawback to the method isthat for many applications the tail must be removed. The system can be designed with alinker between the tail and target protein that can be cleaved chemically. Our discussion of the theory of chromatography is based on many simplifying as- sumptions. Usually the analysis of real columns is more complicated, owing to dispersion,wall effects, and lack of local equilibrium. Wall effects can be reduced by keeping thecolumn-diameter-to-bead-diameter ratio larger than 10 ( D c/Db>10). Bed compression can occur under some operating conditions and can further complicate analysis of the sys-tem by causing flow irregularities such as viscous fingering. Understanding these hydrodynamical and kinetic effects is also critical to scale-up of chromatographic processes. These effects alter the shape of the peaks exiting the col-umn. In addition to these flow effects, the step controlling the rate of adsorption will alterpeak shape. For a porous support internal diffusion, diffusion through the external film, orexternal dispersion (Taylor dispersion) in laminar flow can control the rate of mass trans-fer. In the following we consider a more quantitative description of these ideas. Figure 11.31 depicts the output from a chromatography column. Refering to this figure, we can define some key characteristics of the output.

Thus, (11.86) where yiis the concentration of solute, i, and Fis the solvent flow rate. The value of yican be estimated from the peak height and shape if the peak is as- sumed to be Gaussian. This assumption leads to (11.87) where tmax, iis the time at which the maximum amount of ielutes, tis elution time, and stmax, iis the standard deviation for peak i. Then the yield can be calculated as (11.88) where erf is the error function as defined byYtt ttt ttii tt iD,=\u00da \u00da12 0 372 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11 Figure 11.31.

The key in the above analysis is s. The value of swill depend on dispersion and ad- sorption kinetics. With a more detailed analysis it can be shown that (11.91) where vis the superficial fluid velocity (i.e., volumeteric flow rate divided by column di- ameter A), kais the surface \"reaction\" rate consisting of a reaction rate ( k) and available surface area ( a), and lis column length. The reader may note that s2in eq. 11.91 equals a flow rate divided by the reaction rate and is effectively a Peclet Number. The value of s2 depends on rate controlling step; for example (internal diffusion control) (11.92) (external film control) (11.93) (Taylor dispersion) (11.94) In the above equations dis the diameter of the particle used to pack the column and Dis the effective diffusion coefficient of the solute. Consider the problem of scale-up of a chromatography process to handle increasing amount of product. One approach might be to increase solute concentration while usingthe same column. The danger here is that the packing would become saturated, whichwould reduce purity and yield. Another approach might be to increase both dand Aso as to maintain a constant particle-size-to-bed-diameter ratio. Such an approach maintainsflow patterns, but note from eqs. 11.92 to 11.94 that swould increase if dincreased. Higher values of sindicate broadening of peaks and reduced resolution, yield, and purity. Another approach is to fix dand increase both vand l, but maintain the ratio of vto lcon- stant. While this approach will mathematically keep sconstant, there are practical limita- tions. Lengthening the column increases pressure drop. Since many packings are soft,they compress further, thereby increasing pressure drop, reducing flow, and altering flowpatterns.

Another approach is to increase Aand volumetric flow to maintain a constant vand hence constant s. This yields a \"pancake\" reactor. It is quite workable if the liquid can be applied uniformly overthe surface of the column. Recent advances in the design of packings (particles) for chromatography columns have also assisted in scale-up. Rigid, mechanically strong particles with macropores allowconvective flow both around and through particles. The macropores are intimately con-nected with the micropores, so good mass transfer is maintained. These particles allowfast flow of solvent and solutes and reduce problems of bed compression, allowing col-umn length to be increased. Example 11.4.

Electrophoresis Electrophoresis is used for the separation of charged biomolecules according to their size and charge in an electric field. In an electric field, the drag force on a charged particle isbalanced by electrostatic forces when the particle is moving with a constant terminal ve-locity. A force balance on a charged particle moving with a terminal velocity in an electricfield yields the following equation: (11.95) or (11.96) where qis the charge on the particle, Eis electric field intensity, D Pis particle diameter, mis the viscosity of the fluid, and Vtis the terminal velocity of the particle. Depending on the pH of the medium, electrostatic charges on protein molecules will be different.

The net charge on the protein will determine the velocity of the protein. When a protein molecule is placed in a pH gradient, the elec-trophoretic velocity becomes zero when pH =pI, since the net charge on the protein is zero at pH = pI. Precipitation of proteins in a pH gradient at their isoelectric point isknown as isoelectric focusing . Since the size and charge of protein molecules are different at a given pH, the terminal velocity of the proteins will be different according to eq. 11.96and, therefore, proteins will be separated from each other in an electric field. Certain gels,such as agar or polyacrylamide, are used for protein separations by gel electrophoresis.Gel electrophoresis is an important analytical separation technique. Scale-up is problem-atic due to thermal convection resulting from electrical heating. One analytical and micropreparative version of electrophoresis that has excellent resolution is called two-dimensional protein electrophoresis (2DE). The 2DE procedure isactually the series combination of two electrophoretic separations which resolve proteinmixtures based on two independent characteristics\u2014charge and size. Proteins are firstseparated in a polyacrylamide gel matrix using isoelectric focusing\u2014an equilibrium sepa-ration technique that resolves proteins based on their respective isoelectric points. Pro-teins are subsequently coated with an anionic surfactant and separated by size in anotherpolyacrylamide gel. Finally, proteins are detected using a chemical stain, by autoradiogra-phy or by other methods. The result of this two-dimensional separation is a high-resolution fingerprint of protein expression that is characteristic of a particular biologicalsystem. This technique has at least two orders of magnitude better resolution than anyother analytical tool for protein analysis. Separated protein spots can be cut out of thepolyacrylamide gels and subjected to further microchemical analysis to determine theamino acid sequence. 11.4.11. Electrodialysis Electrodialysis (ED) is a membrane separation method used for the separation of charged molecules from a solution by application of a direct electric current. The membranes con-tain ion-exchange groups and have a fixed electrical charge. Positively charged mem-branes (anion membranes) allow the membranes (cation membranes) allow the passage of cations and repel anions.This method is very effective in the concentration of electrolytes and proteins. The ED process is driven by electrostatic forces and can be used to transfer salts from low to high concentration. Salt solutions can be concentrated or diluted by this method. TheED method is much faster than dialysis and is a more efficient desalting method. Ion-exchange membranes (IEM) used in ED units are in essence ion-exchange resins in sheet form. IEMs contain mobile counterions that carry electric current. Thecation-exchange membrane consists of polystyrene with negatively charged sulfonategroups bonded to phenyl groups in polystyrene. Anion membranes contain positivelycharged quaternary ammonium groups (\u2014N 3R+) chemically bonded to the phenyl groups in the polystyrene. Mobile counterions account for the low electrical resistance of themembranes. To control swelling of sulfonated polystyrene, some cross-linking agentssuch as divinyl benzene are included in the polymer. A typical ED membrane has a pore 376 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 376size of 10 to 20 \u00c5 with a capacity of 2 to 3 mEq/g dw resin. Membrane thickness is on the order of 0.1 to 0.6 mm, and electrical resistance is approximately 3 to 30 ohm/cm2. ED units can be used for (1) concentration and dilution of salts, (2) ion substitution, and (3) electrolysis. A schematic of an ED unit used for concentration and dilution of salts isdepicted in Fig. 11.32. The unit diluting ( D*) concentrating ( C*) anion-cation membranes and two electrodes, thecathode and anode. ED units can also be used for ion-substitution purposes to change theionic composition of a process stream. If the ionic liquid stream is passed between two mem-branes of the same charge (two cation or two anion exchange membranes), ions will betransferred from the solution in one direction through one membrane, and equivalent ions ofthe same charge will be transferred into the solution through the opposite membrane from amakeup solution on the other side of the membrane. In electrolytic ED units, electrodes playan important fundamental role in the process. Two electrode compartments are separated by Sec. 11.4 Separation of Soluble Products 377 Figure 11.32.

An example of an electrolytic ED unit is a chlor-alkali cell in which an NaCl solution is electrolyzed and converted to NaOH and Cl. 11.5. FINISHING STEPS FOR PURIFICATION The major finishing steps in fermentation-product purification are crystallization and drying. 11.5.1. Crystallization Crystallization is usually the last step in producing highly purified products such as an- tibiotics. Crystallization operates at low temperatures, which minimize thermal degrada-tion of heat-sensitive materials. Operations are conducted at high concentrations and,therefore, unit costs are low and separation factors are high. The determination of optimalcrystallization conditions is a matter of empirical experimentation, since phase diagramsand pertinent kinetics for specific systems are usually not available. High-purity crystals are recovered by using batch Nutsche-type filters or centrifugal filters. The following equation is used for the filtration of crystal slurries, assuming thecrystals are noncompressible and the resistance of the filter medium is negligible. (11.97) where DXis the thickness of crystal layer, tis time, Vis liquid volume, DPis pressure drop, Ais surface area, and Kis the transfer coefficient. Substituting W \u00b5V, where Wis the solids concentration in the cake, and integrating eq. 11.97, we obtain (11.98) A typical centrifugal filter combines a bowl centrifuge with a filter, and the following relationship is used to determine the filtration-crystallization rate for centrifugal filters. (11.99) where Nis the rotational speed, ais the specific cake resistance, Wis the solids concen- tration in the cake, A mis the log mean area, and RMis the medium resistance. The nature and size of crystals affect the centrifugation and washing rates; therefore, crys- tallization and recovery steps are interrelated and should be considered together in theoptimization of crystallization operations. After washing, the crystals are discharged for drying. 11.5.2. Drying The removal of solvent from purified wet product (crystal or dissolved solute) is usually achieved by drying. In selecting drying conditions, the physical properties of the product,its heat sensitivity, and the desirable final moisture content must be considered. The para-meters affecting drying can be classified in four categories: physical properties of thedV dtNL rr WA R AL mM=- +() ( 2DdV dtKAP Chap. 11ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 378solid-liquid system, intrinsic properties of the solute, conditions of the drying environ- ment, and heat-transfer parameters. The major types of driers used for drying fermentation product are the following: 1.A vacuum-tray drier consists of heated shelves in a single chamber and is usually used in pharmaceutical products. This is a good method for small batches of expen-sive materials, where product loss and heat damage must be minimized. 2.Freeze drying (lyophilization) is a method where water is removed by sublimation (from solid ice to vapor) from the frozen solution. The freezing can be accom-plished either outside or inside the vacuum chamber prior to drying. This method isused for antibiotics, enzyme solutions, and bacterial suspensions. 3.Rotary-drum driers are not good for crystal solutions. Water is removed by heat con- duction over a thin film of solution on the steam-heated surface of the rotating drum.The dried product is scraped from the drum with the aid of a knife at the discharge point. 4.Spray dryers employ atomization and spraying of product solution into a heated chamber through a nozzle. Hot gas inside the chamber provides the necessary heat for evaporationof the liquid. Dried particles are separated from hot gases using cyclones. Spray dryers areexpensive to purchase but are the preferred method for heat-sensitive materials. 5.Pneumatic conveyor driers use a hot air stream to suspend and transport particles. The retention time of a particle in the gas stream is short, usually a few seconds. Such sys-tems work well when surface drying is critical, but do not provide sufficient exposuretimes to dry large porous particles where water removal is diffusion controlled. Pneu-matic conveyor systems are well suited for heat-sensitive and easily oxidized materials. 11.6. INTEGRATION OF REACTION AND SEPARATION The separate optimization of fermentation and recovery does not necessarily yield the op- timal process. Traditionally, the strain development, fermentation, and recovery expertsworked essentially in isolation. A lack of formal training of engineers in basic biologicalconcepts and of biologists in engineering and process concepts has made an integratedview of the bioprocesses difficult to obtain. Systems have been optimized sequentially,with only modest feedback from downstream to upstream. With improved training of bothengineers and biologists, it has become possible to begin to build better processes. One form of this integration is to try to couple some aspects of recovery and purifi- cation with the bioreactor. The motivation for such approaches has come initially from adesire to relieve product inhibition and thereby increase reaction rates and/or allow theuse of a more concentrated feed. However, other advantages may accrue, such as im-proved selectivity for the product of interest, conversion of a primarily intracellular to anextracellular product, and protection of a product from degradation. Isolated examples of attempts at bioprocess integration stretch back to the begin- ning of modern biochemical engineering. In the 1970s the energy crisis and interest inethanol production spawned many suggested approaches to bioprocess integration. Someearly approaches to such process integration include vacuum fermentation, membraneprocesses, addition of solid adsorbents, and liquid extractants. One example is a reactor system that allows the use of tributylphosphate (TBP) as an extractant of ethanol from fermentation broths. Although TBP had been recognized as Sec. 11.6 Integration of Reaction and Separation 379ch11 10/11/01 5:44 PM Page 379an attractive solvent for this purpose, its direct use for in situ extraction was thought to be impossible due to toxicity. However, further work led to the recognition that a solventcould be toxic due to two features: (1) a chemical or molecular level toxicity due tosolvent dissolved in aqueous broth, and (2) a physical or phase toxicity due to direct inter-action of yeast with droplets of emulsified solvent. It turned out that TBP's toxicity wassolely due to phase toxicity. One way to circumvent this is to immobilize cells in a man-ner that allows entry of nutrients and exit of product while excluding droplets of solvent.One device that can do this is a multimembrane bioreactor (Fig. 11.33). With a hydrophobic membrane, the solvent will readily fill the pores of the membrane. If the aqueous solution is at a pressure higher than the solvent, but less than the critical entrypressure of the aqueous solution into the membrane pores, then the solvent is effectively im-mobilized in the membrane. Such a system allows in situ solvent extraction of product while preventing the emulsification of solvent and phase toxicity. The primary advantages for thistype of bioreactor are the use of more concentrated feeds, relief of feedback inhibition, andreduced distillation or separation costs (e.g., for ethanol recovery). Not only can this integrated view be expressed through the addition of extracting agents, but it can be expressed at the molecular level. Several groups have worked on pro-tein excretion into the extracellular compartment from E. coli using appropriately con- structed plasmids. The motivation for this approach has been to greatly simplify recoveryand purification, rather than any potential increases in reactor productivity. It is important for the bioprocess engineer to consider the whole system. The design or choice of culture, reactor configuration, and separation and purification train must bemade carefully. Small changes in the upstream process can either greatly simplify or com-plicate the design of the downstream process. 11.7 . SUMMARY The recovery and purification of products at the end of fermentation processes is an essen- tial step. Product separation can be accomplished either integrated with or following thefermentation step. The major categories of separation of fermentation products are 380 Recovery and Purification of Products Chap. 11 Figure 11.33. Example of a multimember reactor. The extractant fills the pores of the hydrophobic membrane but cannot pass into the nutrient solution if the pressure on thenutrient side is higher than on the extractant side. S is the substrate and P is the product.(With permission, from T. Cho and M. L. 2:53-60, 1986.)ch11 10/11/01 of biomass or other insoluble products, (2) concentration or primary isola- tion of product, and (3) purification. When the product is the biomass, the separation strategy is relatively simple and in- volves filtration or centrifugation following coagulation-flocculation of the cells. Dryingis required for a marketable biomass, such as a single-cell protein (SCP) source. For soluble products such as antibiotics, enzymes, and organic acids, the separation strategy depends on whether the products are extracellular or intracellular. Some productscan be both. For intracellular products, the cells need to be disrupted for the release of theproducts. Mechanical, chemical, and enzymatic methods can be used for cell disruption.Products need to be separated from the other cell and medium components after cell dis-ruption. Depending on the type and the molecular weight of the product, separation meth-ods involve the removal of cell debris by centrifugation or filtration, followed byextraction or precipitation (for protein products) of the product. The separation strategyfor extracellular products is simpler than that for intracellular products, since cell disrup-tion is not required. After the separation of the biomass from the fermentation medium,the product is separated from the broth by one or a combination of the following methods:liquid-liquid extraction (antibiotics), two-aqueous-phase extraction (enzymes), adsorption(antibiotics), or precipitation (proteins). Protein (enzymes, hormones) separations usually require a special strategy. Proteins are usually precipitated from the media either by salting-out or by the addition of organicsolvents. The desired protein is crudely separated from other protein components, usuallyby ultrafiltration on the basis of its molecular weight. Then some chromatographic meth-ods, such as ion-exchange or affinity chromatography, need to be used for further purifica-tion. After elution of the protein from the chromatographic column, the product must bedried and crystallized, if necessary, before packaging. Depending on the chemical natureof the desired protein and the composition of the protein mixture, sometimes special pro-tein separation methods, such as isoelectric focusing or electrophoresis (for charged pro-teins), may need to be used. Simultaneous separation and fermentation schemes offer special advantages over consecutive schemes, since they may overcome product inhibition and provide a morecompact and economical alternative. Membrane, adsorptive, or extractive separationschemes can be utilized for the simultaneous separation of products during fermentation. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING AIBA, S., A. E.

They are capable of making a vast array of important therapeutic proteins. With recombinant DNA techniques,it is possible to achieve significant levels of production of compounds made only inminute amounts in native cells. Animal cells possess the machinery to do complex post-translational modifications to proteins. This capacity is essential in some cases to the for-mation of a clinically useful product. Let us consider some of the important constraints inusing these cells. 12.1. STRUCTURE AND BIOCHEMISTRY OF ANIMAL CELLS Animal cells vary in size (10 to 30 mm) and shape (spherical, ellipsoidal). In terms of in- tracellular structures, animal cells are typical eucaryotes, and we discussed their cellularstructure in Chapter 2. Figure 12.1 summarizes the structure of a typical animal cell. Animal cells do not have a cell wall, but are surrounded by a thin and fragile plasma membrane that is composed of protein, lipid, and carbohydrate. This structure results insignificant shear sensitivity. In some cells, a portion of the plasma membrane is modifiedto form a number of projections called microvilli . The microvilli increase the surface area of the cell and provide more effective passage of materials across the plasma membrane.The composition of plasma membrane is not uniform and varies in different regions of thech12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 385membrane. The surface of an animal cell is negatively charged, and cells tend to grow on positively charged surfaces, such as Sephadex or collagen (anchorage-dependent cells).Many cells possess specific cell surface receptors that adhere to ligands on the surface.For example, the binding to collagen may be nonspecific or may be mediated by specificcell surface receptors. The degree of cell adhesiveness is usually greater if attachment isreceptor mediated. Some animal cells such as hybridomas are nonanchorage dependentand grow in suspension culture. Inside the cytoplasm of most animal cells is an extensive network of membrane- bounded channels called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The membranes of the ER di- vide the cytoplasm into two phases: the lumenal phase (inside the endoplasmic reticulum) and the cytosol (outside the rough endoplasmic membrane). Ribosomes are usually lo- cated on the outer surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. Some ribosomes are located incytoplasm and may be interconnected by fine filaments. The ER is critical in protein syn-thesis and initial stages of posttranslational processing (see Chapter 4). Mitochondria are the powerhouse of cells where respiration takes place and the bulk of the ATPs are produced. Mitochondria are independent organelles in the cytoplasmcontaining DNA and are capable of independent reproduction. Each mitochondrion issurrounded by a double membrane: a smooth outer membrane and a highly foldedinner membrane called the cristae . The mitochondrial matrix crystallike inclusions. Lysosomes are rather small cytoplasmic organelles bound by a single membrane, and they contain various hydrolytic enzymes, such as proteases, nucleases, and esterases.Lysosomes are responsible for the digestion of certain food particles ingested by the cell. The Golgi body is a cytoplasmic organelle surrounded by a rather irregularly shaped membrane called the cisternae . The cisternae of a Golgi body are often stacked together in parallel rows, called dictyosome . The Golgi apparatus is responsible for the completion of complex glycosylation and for collecting and secreting extracellular proteins or direct-ing intracellular protein traffic to other organelles. Some cells organelles oxysomes . These organelles bounded by a single membrane and contain a number of enzymes, including peroxidases (hydrolysis of H 2O2) and glyoxalases (glyoxylic acid metabolism). 386 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Animal Cell Cultures Chap. 12 Figure 12.1. Generalized animal cell. rest of thecell by selectively permeable membranes.ch12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 386The nucleus is bounded by two nuclear membranes that form a nuclear envelope. At certain positions, the inner and outer membrane of nucleus fuse to form pores . Nuclear pores provide continuity between the cytoplasm and the inner part of the nucleus. Theperinuclear space (the space between the two membranes of the nucleus) may have ac- cess to the outer cell. The nucleus contains chromosomal DNA and also some dark granu-lar structures called nucleoli , which can be seen under an electron microscope. Nucleoli are not bound by a membrane and appear to be formed by ribosomal material. Animal cells have a cytoskeleton or system of protein filaments that provide cell mechanical strength, control cell shape, and guide cell movement. These elements areoften critical components in controlling cell response to mechanical forces such as fromfluid flow or from attachment to surfaces. The three types of filaments are actin filaments , intermediate filaments , and microtubules . Actin filaments are relatively thin, while micro- tubules have the largest diameter. Microtubules are critical in cell division and cell move-ment. Cell division and movement require the and thus \"freezing\" the cell in a nondividing step. The centrosome is the primary microtubule-organizing center in the cell and is a small organelle involved inthe formation of spindle poles during mitosis. Some animal cells may contain cilia, which are used to transport substrate across the cell surface, but not for self-locomotion. Eachcilium is covered by a plasma membrane and contains a specific array of microtubules. The metabolism of nutrients by animal cells in culture is very different from that in other types of cells. A typical growth medium of an animal cell culture contains glucose,glutamine, nonessential and essential amino acids, serum (horse or calf), and mineral salts(for example, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media, DME). The major metabolic pathwaysfor animal cells in culture are depicted in Fig. 12.2. Glucose is converted to pyruvate byglycolysis and also is utilized for biomass synthesis through the pentose phosphate path-way. Pyruvate is converted partly to CO 2and H2O by the TCA cycle, partly to lactic acid, and partly to fatty acids. Glucose is used as a carbon and energy source, as is glutamine.Part of the glutamine is deaminated to yield ammonium and glutamate, which is convertedto other amino acids for biosynthesis purposes. Glutamine also enters into the TCA cycleto yield carbon skeletons for other amino acids and to yield ATP, CO 2, and H2O. Animal cells are also capable of synthesizing glucose from pyruvate by the gluconeogenesis path-way. The release of lactate and ammonia as waste products of metabolism is a major prob-lem in high-cell-density culture systems. Both lactate and ammonia at high levels aretoxic to cells, primarily by altering intracellular and lysosomal pH. 12.2. METHODS USED FOR THE CULTIVATION OF ANIMAL CELLS The techniques used for cultivation of animal cells differ significantly from those used with bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. Tissues excised from specific organs of animals, such aslung and kidney, under aseptic conditions are transferred into a growth medium contain-ing serum and small amounts of antibiotics in small T-flasks. These cells form a primary culture. Unlike plant cells, primary mammalian cells do not normally form aggregates, but grow in the form of monolayers on support surfaces such as glass surfaces of flasks. Sec. 12.2 Methods Used for the Cultivation of Animal Cells 387ch12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 387Using the proteolytic enzyme trypsin, individual cells in a tissue can be separated to form single-cell cultures. To start cultures of animal cells, excised tissues are cut into small pieces ( ~2 mm3) and are placed in an agitated solution of trypsin ( buffered saline for 120 min at 37\u00b0C. The cell suspension is passed through a presterilizedfilter to clear the solution, and cells are washed in the centrifuge. The cells are then resus-pended in growth medium and placed in T-flasks or roller bottles. Cells usually attachonto the glass surface of the bottle and grow to form a monolayer. The cells growing onsupport surfaces are known as anchorage-dependent cells. Surface attachment is neces- sary for these cells to assume the three-dimensional shape necessary for the alignment ofinternal structures in a manner allowing growth. However, some cells grow in suspensionculture and are known to be nonanchorage-dependent cells. The cells directly derived from excised tissues are known as the primary culture. A cell line obtained from the primary culture is known as the secondary culture. Cells are re- moved from the surfaces of flasks using a solution of EDTA, trypsin, collagenase, orpronase. The exposure time for cell removal is 5 to 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After cells are re-moved from surfaces, serum is added to the culture bottle. The serum-containing suspen-sion is centrifuged, washed with buffered isotonic saline solution, and used to inoculate 388 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Animal Cell Cultures Chap. 12 Figure 12.2. Major metabolic pathways in an animal cell. For cultured cells, glucose and glutamine are the major sources of carbon and energy. Lactate and ammonia are theprimary waste products, although the release of alanine can be important. Symbols: 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 388secondary cultures. Many secondary lines can be adapted to grow in suspension and are nonanchorage dependent. Most differentiated mammalian cell lines (e.g., human fibroblasts such as WI-38 and MRC-5 that are licensed for human vaccine production) are mortal . These cell lines undergo a process called senescence . Essentially, the cells, for reasons that are not completely un- derstood, will divide only for a limited number of generations (e.g., about 30 generations forthe MRC-5 cells). Cells that can be propagated indefinitely are called continuous , immortal , or transformed cell lines. Cancer cells are naturally immortal. All cancerous cell lines are transformed, although it is not clear whether all transformed cell lines are cancerous. Because of the linkage of cancer to cell transformation, the FDA had been reluctant to approve products made from transformed cells. However, transformed cells usually be-come attachment independent and can be propagated indefinitely in suspension culture,which is highly desirable for large-scale production in bioreactors. A little over a decadeago the FDA began to approve processes for production of products, such as the therapeu-tic protein, tissue plasminogen activator, from processes using immortalized cells. The ap-proval of such processes has provided a major impetus for development of bioprocessesbased on suspension cultures of animal cells. Table 12.1 provides a summary of differences between nontransformed and trans- formed cells. One particular characteristic is contact inhibition . In two-dimensional cul- ture on a surface nontransformed cells form only a monolayer, as cell division is inhibitedwhen a cell's surface is in contact with other cells. Transformed cells do not \"sense\" thepresence of other cells and keep on dividing to form multilayer structures. Although mammalian cell lines have been the primary focus of work in animal cell culture, the two are not synonymous. Insect, fish, and crustacean cell cultures are evolvingtechnologies. In particular, insect cell culture is unusually promising for biotechnologicalpurposes. The baculovirus that infects insect cells is an ideal vector for genetic engineer-ing, because it is nonpathogenic to humans and has a very strong promoter that encodesfor a protein that is not essential for virus production in cell culture. The insertion of agene under the control of this promoter can lead to high expression levels (40 %of the total protein as the target protein). Most cell lines are derived from ovaries or embryonictissue, although at least one differentiated cell line (a BTI-EAA blood cell line) has beenmaintained in indefinite culture for 25 years. Insect cell lines are not transformed but arenaturally continuous. In contrast, senescence is observed with many fish cell lines.

Hybridoma cells are ob- tained by fusing lymphocytes (normal blood cells that make antibodies) with myeloma(cancer) cells. Lymphocytes producing antibodies grow slowly and are mortal. After fu-sion with myeloma cells, hybridomas become immortal, can reproduce indefinitely, andproduce antibodies. Using hybridoma cells, highly specific, monoclonal (originating fromone cell) antibodies can be produced against specific antigens. To produce hybridoma cells, animals (mice) are injected (immunized) with certain antigens (see Fig. 12.3). As a reaction to antigens, the animals produce antibodies. Theantibody-producing cells (e.g., spleen B lymphocytes) are separated from blood sera andfused with certain tumor cells (e.g., myeloma cells with infinite capacity to proliferate andderived from lymphocytes). The resulting cells are hybrid cells (hybridomas), whichsecrete highly specific antibodies (monoclonal Ab's) against the immunizing antigen. Mammalian cell culture to produce proteins other than antibodies usually involves genetically engineered cells. Although many host cells can be used, Chinese hamsterovary (CHO) cells are particularly popular. Most of the vectors for genetic engineering arederived from viruses (usually primate). Some inducible promoters exist. However, expres-sion levels are relatively low, often in the range of 1 %to 5 %of the total cellular protein. A typical growth medium for mammalian cells contains serum (5 %to 20 %), inor- ganic salts, nitrogen sources, carbon and energy sources, vitamins, trace elements, growthfactors, and buffers in water. Serum is a cell-free liquid recovered from blood. Examplesare FBS (fetal bovine serum), CS (calf serum), and HS (horse serum). The exact composi-tion of any serum product is not known. However, serum is known to contain amino acids,growth factors, vitamins, certain proteins, hormones, lipids, and minerals. A list of major 390 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Animal Cell Cultures Chap. 12 Figure 12.3. Formation of a hybridoma for making a monoclonal antibody.

The major functions of serum are as follows: 1.To stimulate cell growth and other cell activities by hormones and growth factors 2.To enhance cell attachment by certain proteins such as collagen and fibronectin 3.To provide transport proteins carrying hormones, minerals, and lipids Serum is an expensive medium component ($100 to $500/l) and may cause further com- plications in the cultivation and downstream separation processes. The demand for serumis increasing rapidly and periodically exceeds supply. The presence of serum proteins andpeptides greatly complicates downstream processing. Serum must be filtered sterilized,and contamination with viruses and possibly mycoplasma (a wallless bacterium) are po-tential problems. Contamination by prions (agents that cause diseases such as \"mad cow\"disease) is a real concern, and source animals cannot come from regions known to havecontaminated animals. Serum-containing medium foams easily. Perhaps most disturbingfrom a production perspective is the intrinsic variability in serum. No one batch of serum Sec. 12.2 Methods Used for the Cultivation of Animal Cells 391TABLE 12.2 Important Components of Serum and Their Probable Role in Cell Culture Component Probable function Proteins Albumin Osmoticum and buffer Lipid, hormone, mineral MitogenPlatelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) Mitogen and major growth factor Hormones Hydrocortisone Promotes attachment and proliferationInsulin Promotes uptake of glucose and amino acidsGrowth hormones Mitogen\u2014present in fetal sera Metabolites and nutrients Amino acids Cell proliferationGlucose Cell proliferationKeto-acids (e.g., pyruvate) Cell proliferationLipids (e.g., cholesterol) Membrane synthesis Minerals Iron, copper, zinc, and selenium Enzymes and other constituents Inhibitors g-globulin Bacterial toxins from prior contaminants Chalones (tissue-specific inhibitors) aA mitogen is a substance that signals mitosis to begin.ch12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 391is ever identical to another. A batch of serum will last only a year before deteriorating. Changes in serum batches require extensive testing. Because of the aforementioned disadvantages of serum-containing media, low- serum or serum-free media have been developed. Typical compositions of two definedmedia are listed in Table 12.3. Serum-free medium contains basal salts (inorganic salts,carbon, nitrogen compounds), vitamins, growth factors, and hormones (e.g., insulin, trans-ferrin, hydrocortisone, progesterone, fibronectin). By using a serum-free medium, we canreduce the cost of media, eliminate some potential problems in product purification, im-prove the reproducibility of results, and reduce the chance of contamination.

Not all cell lines have been adapted to serum-free media. A number of defined media have been developed. Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM), Dulbecco's enriched (modified) Eagle's medium and are supplemented with 5 %to 10 %(by volume) of serum when used. For serum-free media formulations, often a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of DMEM(nutrient rich) and F12 (rich in trace elements and vitamins) is used. More specializedmedia (e.g., MCDB 170MDS) may be used for serum-free growth of specific cell lines. Asimpler serum-free medium may contain insulin, transferrin, and selenium as serum re-placement components, in addition to glucose, glutamine, other amino acids, and salts.Filtered whole lymph from a cow has been used as a growth medium for some mam-malian cells. Mammalian cells grow at 37\u00b0C and pH \u00aa7.3. Typical doubling times are 12 to 20 h. Usually, 5 %CO 2-enriched air is used to buffer the medium pH around pH =7.3. A car- bonate buffer (HCO2- 3/H2CO- 3) is used to control pH around 7.3. Since bicarbonate is used up by the cells, CO2-enriched air is provided to balance carbonate equilibrium to keep pH \u00aa7.3. The culture medium needs to be gently aerated and agitated. Other buffers such as HEPES ( N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine- to keep \u00aa7.3 \u00b10.1. Insect cells grow best at about 28\u00b0C and a pH of about 6.2. Fish cell lines tolerate a wide range of temperature, although temperatures below 37\u00b0C are usuallypreferred (25\u00b0 to 35\u00b0C). Values for pH typical of mammalian cell cultures are usually sat-isfactory for fish cells; pH values between 7.0 and 7.5 usually give good growth. The kinetics of the growth of mammalian cells are similar to microbial growth. Usually, the stationary phase is relatively short, and the concentration of viable cells dropssharply thereafter, as a result of the accumulation of toxic metabolic products such as lac-tate and ammonium. A high level of ammonium is usually the result of glutamine metabo-lism, and lactate is usually a product of glucose metabolism. Cell concentration reaches apeak value within three to five days. However, product formation, such as monoclonal an-tibody formation by hybridoma cells, can continue under nongrowth conditions. Most ofthe products of mammalian cell cultures are mixed-growth associated, and product forma-tion takes place both during the growth phase and after growth ceases. Figure 12.4 depictsa typical variation of growth, product (MAb's) formation, and glucose utilization by hy-bridoma cells. The kinetics of product formation (e.g., MAb formation by hybridoma cells) can be described by a Luedeking-Piret equation: (6.18) where mis the specific growth rate. The first term in eq. 6.18 is for growth-associated pro- duction and the second term is nongrowth-associated. The doubling time of mammaliancells varies between 10 and 50 h, and a typical value is 20 h. As expected, the growth ratevaries depending on cell type, medium composition (including growth factors), and otherenvironmental conditions (dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide levels, pH, ionic strength). 1 Xdp dtqp == a m + b 394 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Animal Cell Cultures Chap. 12ch12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 394Animal cells require 0.06 to 0.2 \u00a510-12mol O2/h cell, which is about five times less than the oxygen requirements of many plant cells and much lower than for microbialcells. Typical animal cell concentration in suspension culture media is 0.1 to 1 g/l (5 \u00a510 5 to 5 \u00a5106cells/ml) for suspension cultures and 10 to 50 times higher than this in immobi- lized/surface culture systems. For a cell culture density of 106cells/ml, the oxygen re- quirement is on the order of 0.1 to 0.6 mmol O2/l h. For shallow culture depths of 2 to 5 cm, oxygen supplied by air in the head space of the vessel should meet the oxygen re-quirements of cells. Forced aeration is required for submerged cultivation of denser cul-tures. However, animal cells are very shear sensitive, and rising air bubbles may causeshear damage to cells, particularly at the point of bubble rupture. Very small bubbles areless damaging. For this reason, special aeration and agitation systems are designed for an-imal cell cultures. Techniques that decouple agitation (and shear) from oxygenation areparticularly attractive. Chemicals (e.g., Pluronic \u00aeF-68) can be added to provide shear protection. Since the oxygen requirements of animal cells are relatively low, the oxygentransfer coefficient need not be as high as for bacterial fermentations. Typical values ofk Lafor suspension cultures (106cells/ml) are 5 to 25 h-1. Animal cells are usually culti- vated in spinner flasks of 0.5 to 10 l in the laboratory. Spinner flasks contain a magneti-cally driven impeller or spoonlike agitators that operate at 10 to 60 rpm. Aeration isusually by surface aeration using 5 %CO 2-enriched and filtered air for mammalian cell lines. Spinner flasks are set on a magnetic stirrer plate in a CO2incubator.

Time trajectories of hybridoma growth and monoclonal antibody produc- tion at different dissolved-oxygen concentrations in a 3-1 fermenter. (With permission,from S. Reuveay, D. Velez, J. D. 1986.)ch12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 395Although cell is the most obvious result of excess shear, sublytic levels of shear can be important. For a variety of cell lines, it has been shown that attached cells re-spond to shear by elongating and reorienting themselves to minimize shear stress. Also,the distribution and numbers of cell surface receptors can be altered. These receptors in-teract directly with components in the medium, such as growth factors, that regulate cellmetabolism. Alterations in the production of specific proteins and the rates of DNA syn-thesis have been observed as responses to shear. This response to sublytic shear compli-cates scale-up, since the same cells exposed to the same medium, but at different levels ofshear, may produce the product of interest at different rates. Also processes, such as N-linked glycosylation, can be altered by shear, resulting in protein products that differpotentially in therapeutic value. 12.3. BIOREACTOR CONSIDERATIONS FOR ANIMAL CELL CULTURE Mammalian cells are large (10 to 20 mm diameter), slow growing ( t d\u00aa10 to 50 h), and very shear sensitive. Moreover, some animal cells are anchorage dependent and mustgrow on surfaces of glass, specially treated plastics, natural polymers such as collagen, orother support materials; some are not anchorage dependent and can grow in suspensionculture. Product concentration (titer) is usually very low ( mg/ml), and toxic metabolites such as ammonium and lactate are produced during growth. These properties of animalcells set certain constraints on the design of animal cell bioreactors. Certain common fea-tures of these reactors are the following: 1.The reactor should be gently aerated and agitated. Some mechanically agitated reac- tors operating at agitation speeds over 20 rpm and bubble-column and airlift reactorsoperating at high aeration rates may cause shear damage to cells. Shear sensitivity isstrain dependent. 2.Well-controlled homogeneous environmental conditions (T, pH, DO, redox poten- tial) and a supply of CO 2-enriched air need to be provided. 3.A large support material surface-volume ratio needs to be provided for anchorage- dependent cells. 4.The removal of toxic products of metabolism, such as lactic acid and ammonium, and the concentration of high-value products, such as MAb's, vaccines, and lym-phokines, should be accomplished during cell cultivation. The laboratory-scale cultivation of animal cells is carried out in (1) T-flasks (25 ml to 100 ml) for anchorage-dependent cell lines and for shallow suspension cultures, (2) spinner flasks (100 ml to 1 l) with paddle-type magnetic agitators, (3) roller bottles (50 ml to 5 l) rotating at about 1 to 5 rpm, and (4) trays containing shallow liquid suspen-sion culture. These laboratory-scale reactors are placed in a carbon dioxide incubator at37\u00b0C (5 %CO 2-containing air) for the cultivation of mammalian cells. Different steps need to be taken for anchorage-dependent and suspension cells when scaling up animalcell cultures. An example of these steps for one cell line is presented in Fig. 12.5. Reactorswith a high surface-volume ratio (microcarrier systems, hollow-fiber reactors, ceramic 396 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Animal Cell Cultures Chap. 12ch12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 396matrix systems, weighted porous beads) are used for anchorage-dependent cells. How- ever, some modified stirred reactors and airlift or bubble-column reactors are used for sus-pension cultures. Membrane bioreactors and microencapsulation methods have beendeveloped for simultaneous cell cultivation, product concentration, and toxic product re-moval. Many of these systems behave as perfusion reactors (see Chapter 9). In essence, aperfusion system exists when cells are retained in the reactor, medium is added continu-ously or semicontinuously, and spent medium is removed. The removal of spent mediumremoves toxic metabolites. The classic method for animal cell culture has been roller bottles, and they have been important components in the scale-up of processes using anchorage-dependent cells(Fig. 12.5). With roller bottles the liquid covers about 25 %of the surface area. Bottles are Sec. 12.3 Bioreactor Considerations for Animal Cell Culture 397 Figure 12.5. Example of scale-up of animal cell cultivation using BHK (baby hamster kidney) 21 cells. Numbers in parentheses denote total amount of cells produced at the in-dicated stage. (With permission, from H. W. D. Katinger and Scheirer, Acta 5:48 PM Page 397rotated about the long axis (1 to 5 rpm). Cells adhere to the walls of the bottle and are ex- posed to liquid 25 %of the time and to gas (e.g., 5 %CO2and 95 %air) 75 %of the time. When exposed to the liquid, nutrients can be transported into the cell, and when in the gasphase, aeration takes place. The roller-bottle system has an advantage over T-flasks be-cause of increased surface area, agitation of the liquid, and better aeration. Roller bottlesare not typically used for large-scale production because of high labor requirements andbottle-to-bottle variability. However, a highly automated facility making extensive use ofrobots uses roller bottles for commercial production of erythropoietin (a therapeutic pro-tein). Roller bottles are also used for production of some vaccines. The use of microcarriers for the cultivation of anchorage-dependent mammalian cells is an attractive approach. For example, microcarriers such as DEAE-Sephadexbeads, which provide large surface per unit volume of reactor ( ~70,000 cm 2/l), allow high cell concentrations in the medium ( ~107cells/ml). The microcarrier beads with cells are suspended in stirred bioreactor. Other microcarrier beads, such as polyacrylamide, poly-styrene, cellulose glass, and gelatin-coated dextran beads, have been devel-oped. At present the most widely used microcarriers are dextran- and DEAE-based(DEAE-Sephadex, DEAE-polyacrylamide). The surfaces of these microcarrier beads canbe modified by addition of compounds, such as collagen, to promote cell adhesion and en-hance cell function. Cells grow on the surfaces of microcarriers, usually in the form ofmonolayers and sometimes as multilayers. Microcarrier culture methods provide a largesurface area for growth and a rather homogeneous growth environment. Microcarrierbeads can be placed in a gently agitated reactor vessel, in a fluidized bed, or in an airlift(bubble-column) fermenter. Bead-to-bead contact and abrasion of the surfaces can be aproblem, and the nonporous nature of these carriers limits the available surface area. Agi-tation of large-scale vessels with microcarrier cultures is difficult, owing to balancing theneeds for aeration and mixing against the shear sensitivity of cells attached to microcarri-ers. Shear forces are more harmful to cells attached to microcarriers than to suspendedcells because attached cells cannot \"tumble,\" and shear tends to \"rip\" them off the carriersurface. Macroporous microcarriers can be used; cells which enter the pores are shieldedfrom shear effects. However, diffusional limitations and heterogeneous growth conditionsmay cause undesirable results. Because cells are easily retained in the bioreactor, micro-carrier cultures are well suited for perfusion operation. Conventional stirred-tank bioreactors have been modified to reduce shear rates on cells in suspension. Sail-type and axial-flow hydrofoil agitators have been developed andused for suspension cultures. The agitation rate in these reactors is on the order of 10 to40 rpm, providing low shear rate. Many animal cells can be cultured as suspensions inbioreactors up to 10,000 l in size. Because cells are significantly smaller than the turbulenteddies in these bioreactors, cell lysis is minimized. Only cells that are at the interface ofan eddy and another eddy or another surface (e.g., reactor wall) are likely to experiencedamage. Cells at the gas-liquid interface are particularly prone to damage. The breakageof air bubbles is particularly destructive to cells that accumulate at the interface of a gasbubble and medium. Many shear protecting agents (such as serum or Pluronic F-68) work by preventing cells from accumulating at the gas-liquid interface. While gas exchange can be accom-plished with membranes or silicone rubber tubing, sparging of gas is the simplest methodand is acceptable with many cell lines when shear protectants are used. Cell lines differ in 398 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Animal Cell Cultures PM Page 398shear sensitivity; Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, widely used for protein production, are relatively resistant to shear damage. Gross shear damage where cells lyse ( necrosis ) is obvious. More subtle effects of shear include changes in physiology and, possibly, induc-tion of apoptosis or programmed cell death. These more subtle changes can alter apparent growth rates, productivity, and product quality (e.g., due to release of degradative en-zymes into the medium). Hollow-fiber reactors have also been used to provide a high growth surface-volume ratio and, therefore, high cell concentrations. Cells are immobilized on the external surfacesof hollow fibers, and nutrients pass through the tubes. Cell concentrations comparable tothose found in tissues can be reached in hollow-fiber reactors. However, the control of mi-croenvironmental conditions inside the reactor where cells are immobilized on fiber sur-faces is very difficult, because there is almost no mixing (i.e., a heterogeneous environment).Also, the quantification of growth and product formation is difficult in such a system. How-ever, it is possible to construct the reactor using fibers of known MW cutoff to control theflux of different-molecular-weight products into the effluent stream. The accumulation ofsome toxic products, such as lactate and ammonium, in the fiber reactors may cause highlevels of inhibition. Selection of fiber material (MW cutoff) and flow regime are critical fac-tors for the rapid removal of toxic metabolic products. Hollow-fiber reactors have been usedfor the production of MAb's from hybridoma cells. Antibody concentrations on the order of5 to 50 mg/ml have been obtained with this reactor since product is retained by the mem-brane while medium flows in through the membrane and lower molecular wastes flow out ofthe cell compartment. Because of severe mass transfer and control problems, this reactormay not be suitable for large-scale production purposes. To overcome some of the difficul-ties with axial-flow hollow-fiber reactors, radial-flow or cross-flow hollow-fiber units havebeen developed. Hollow fiber reactors are well suited to perfusion operation with continu-ous feed. MAb production from hybridomas can be sustained for extended periods (e.g., 100days), as stationary-phase cells still synthesize product. The immobilization of mammalian cells in gel beads (agar, alginate, collagen, poly- acrylamide) and the use of such systems in a packed- or fluidized-bed configuration arepossible. Such immobilization methods and reactor configurations will reduce or elimi-nate the shear effects on cells. High cell densities make high volumetric productivitiespossible. However, the control of microenvironmental conditions inside bead particles andthe accumulation of toxic metabolic products in beads are potential problems. A tubular ceramic matrix has been used for the immobilization and cultivation of hybridoma cells. High cell and, therefore, MAb concentrations can be obtained using suchsystems. The quantification of cell concentration and the control of microenvironmentalconditions within the heterogeneous cell culture in ceramic matrix are some of the majordifficulties, although these matrices do provide well-defined flow channels. Scale-up of aceramic matrix reactor may be difficult because of the heterogeneous nature of the systemwhen long tubes are used. Microencapsulation is another method used for the immobilization of animal cells. Hybridoma cells have been encapsulated within spherical membranes of polylysine-alginate for production of MAb's. Typical capsule size is 300 to 500 mm, and the molecu- lar weight cutoff of these capsule membranes is 60 to 70 kda. Microcapsules operatelike small membrane bioreactors, in which very high cell concentrations can be reached(~10 8cells/ml). Using the right capsule membrane with a desired MW cutoff, toxic Sec. 12.3 Bioreactor Considerations for Animal Cell Culture 399ch12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 399products such as lactate and ammonium can be removed from intracapsule culture media, and high-MW products such as MAb's or lymphokines can be concentrated inside cap-sules. Moreover, cells are protected from hydrodynamic shear by encapsulation, providinga suitable environment for direct aeration. However, the growth and product-formationrate inside capsules may be limited by the diffusion of nutrients such as dissolved oxygenor glucose, especially at large capsule sizes. The reduction of capsule size to eliminatemass transfer limitations (down to 200 mm) and the control of pore size to concentrate de- sired products within the capsule are two promising approaches to solve some of the prob-lems associated with encapsulated cells. By varying the concentration and average MW ofpoly- L-lysine (PPL), the pore size of the capsule membrane can be controlled within cer- tain limits (30 to 80 kda). Monitoring and control of microenvironmental conditionswithin capsules (pH, DO level, nutrient-product gradient) are major problems that imposelimitations on growth and product formation inside capsules. The fragile nature of themicrocapsule also limits the scale-up potential of this system. 12.4. PRODUCTS OF ANIMAL CELL CULTURES Animal cell products usually consist of high-molecular-weight proteins with or without glycosidic groups. A number of enzymes, hormones, vaccines, immunobiologicals(monoclonal antibodies, lymphokines) and anticancer agents can be produced using ani-mal cell culture technology (see Table 12.4). The major types of immunobiologicals produced by animal cells are (1) monoclonal antibodies, (2) regulators (interleukins, lymphokines), and (3) virusvaccines (prophylactics). 12.4.1. Monoclonal Antibodies Among the most important products of animal cell culture have been monoclonal antibod- ies (MAb's). MAb's are produced by hybridoma cells and are used in diagnostic assaysystems, for therapeutic purposes, and for biological separations (e.g., affinity chromatog-raphy). MAb's have been used as diagnostic agents to determine hundreds of drugs,toxins, vitamins, and other biological compounds. MAb's are also used for chromato-graphic separations to purify protein molecules. Purification of interferon by affinity chro-matography is an example of the use of MAb's for protein purification purposes. MAb's 400 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Animal Cell Cultures Chap. 12TABLE 12.4 Major Categories of Products of Animal Cell Cultures Immunobiologicals Hormones Monoclonal antibodies EnzymesLymphokines and interleukines Insecticides Virus vaccines factorsCell surface antigens Whole cells Tissues Organsch12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 400also may serve as \"magic\" bullets to target toxic agents to cancer tumors. However, the large size of MAb's has limited their ability to penetrate some tumors. Antibody frag-ments can be used instead; these products can be made in nonmammalian cells. 12.4.2. Immunobiological Regulators Interferon (an anticancer glycoprotein secreted by animal cells upon exposure to cancer- causing agents) is an example of an immunoregulator produced by mammalian cells. In-terferon can be produced by either animal cells or recombinant (genetically engineered)bacteria. Other immunoregulators are lymphokines (hormonal proteins regulating immuneresponses of human body), interleukines (anticancer agents), tissue plasminogen activator(a compound preventing blood clotting), and thymosin. The production of immunoregula-tors is a very promising area with a great potential for growth in the near future. 12.4.3. Virus Vaccines Various virus vaccines (prophylactics) have been produced for animal and human use. In some cases live virus is propagated in animal cells. Virus is then collected and inactivated(\"killed\" virus) and used as a vaccine. In other cases a weakened or attenuated form of the virus is used that will induce a protective response but no disease. However, most vac-cines now under development are subunit vaccines . Typically a protein displayed on the surface of the virus particle is produced. An epitope or small region of the protein is rec- ognized by the immune system and induces a protective immune response. For the epitopeto be displayed properly, the protein may need to assemble into a viruslike particle . Such a particle is an empty capsid that contains no nucleic acid. The absence of viral DNA orRNA increases the safety of the product. 12.4.4. Hormones Some animal hormones are large molecules (50 to 200 amino acids) and are glycosylated. These hormones can be produced by using cell cultures of the hormone-synthesizingorgan. Some potential hormone products from animal cells are follicle-stimulating hor- mone, chorionic hormone, and erythropoetin. Some animal hormones are relatively smallpolypeptides (20 to 30 amino acids) and may be produced by chemical synthesis. Erythro-poetin is a very successful commercial product useful in treating anemia in a wide rangeof disorders from patients on artificial kidneys to those with AIDS. 12.4.5. Enzymes A number of enzymes can be produced by animal cell cultures. The synthesis and excre- tion of these enzymes are targets of genetic engineering. Glycosylation, posttranslationalmodification, and excretion from the host organism are potential problems. Some poten-tial enzyme products from animal pepsin, trypsin, hyaluronidase, and blood-clotting compounds such as factor VII, Sec. 12.4 Products of Animal Cell Cultures 401ch12 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 401factor VIII, and factor X. The large-scale production of tissue plasminogen activator is an important commercial process. 12.4.6. Insecticides Animal cell cultures have been used to produce some insect viruses that are highly spe- cific and safe to the environment. Several of the baculoviruses have federal approval foruse as insecticides. Genetically engineered variants with greater virulence can now beproduced. The commercial production of such viruses from tissue culture has not yet beenaccomplished. 12.4.7 . Whole Cells and Tissue Culture The production of differentiated cells for medical use is under early development. Artifi- cial skin for burn patients is one example. Artificial organs and semisynthetic bone anddental structures are potentially feasible. 12.5. SUMMARY Animal cells are well suited for the production of proteins requiring extensive and accu- rate posttranslational processing, organized tissues (artificial skin), certain vaccines, andviruses that can be used as pesticides. Animal cells are more complex and fragile than bacterial, fungal, or yeast cultures. These characteristics require the development of unique strategies for cultivation. Critical distinctions are primary cell lines (established directly from tissue) and sec- ondary cell lines, which are established from primary cell lines. Normal cell lines are mortal ; they can divide only a finite number of times. Other cell lines are transformed or immortal and divide indefinitely. Many cell lines will grow only when attached to a sur- face and are thus anchorage dependent . Some cells, particularly transformed cell lines, can grow in suspension. One particularly important type of suspension cell is the hy- bridoma . This cell is a hybrid of a mortal antibody-producing cell with a transformed cell, which results in an immortal, easily cultured cell line that produces a single type of anti-body or a monoclonal antibody . The media used to grow animal cells must provide a variety of growth factors, glu- cose, glutamine, amino acids, specific salts, and vitamins. In some cases, serum fromanimals (especially mammals) is used. However, serum is expensive, increases the proba-bility of contamination, is undefined in composition, is variable from lot to lot, and com-plicates the downstream recovery of protein products. In many cases, our knowledge ofcellular nutrition has allowed the development of serum-free media, and the use of suchmedia is of increasing importance. Many potential bioreactor configurations are commercially available for use with animal cells. The reactor design problem centers on providing sufficient oxygen and nutri-ents and (for anchorage-dependent cells) surface area to achieve high cell densities whileminimizing exposure to liquid shear. Also, complete medium utilization and high productconcentrations are sought. Designs must minimize the formation of toxic by-products 402 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Animal Cell 10/11/01 5:48 PM Page 402(for example, lactate and or effectively remove such metabolites from the mi- croenvironment of the cells.

WHY PLANT CELL CULTURES? The plant kingdom is very diverse. Many thousands of chemicals are produced only in plants. The biosynthetic capabilities of plant cells have been little explored. Only a fewpercent of the world's plants have been scientifically named or described, and only a smallfraction of these have been screened for the production of novel and useful compounds.The great genetic potential of plants to produce compounds of use to humans has been lit-tle exploited. In fact, the rapid destruction of forests worldwide is leading to the extinctionof many plants without preservation of their genomes. Even the small number of characterized plants have yielded many important com- pounds (e.g., over 120 prescription drugs). In the Western world, over 25 %of pharmaceuti- cals are derived from extraction from whole plants, and a much greater fraction of medicinalsare plant-derived in Asia and the rest of the world. In addition to uses as medicinals, plantproducts are of interest as dyes, food colors, food flavors, fragrances, insecticides, and herbi-cides. Some compounds of potential commercial interest are listed in Table 13.1. These compounds are chemically complex and are generally nonproteins. The com- pounds most likely to be of commercial interest are those that are not synthesized bymicrobes and are of sufficient complexity that chemical synthesis is not a reasonable al-ternative. Also, these nonprotein products are often made by the condensation ofintermediates from separate pathways. Plant genetics and physiology are poorlych13 10/11/01 5:52 PM Page 405understood in comparison to animal or bacterial systems. Because of the difficulty of find- ing and recovering genes from unrelated pathways, genetic engineering using more easilygrown organisms to make these products is not now an attractive alternative to plant cellculture. Plant cell tissue cultures have low volumetric productivities, so higher-valueproducts ( $500/kg) are reasonable targets. Thus, the chemicals of greatest commercial interest must be of intermediate to high value and unique to the plant kingdom. A good example of bioprocess development using plant cell cultures is for the produc- tion of the important anticancer agent, paclitaxel (Taxol). Supply problems greatly impededthe clinical development of this drug. Initially paclitaxel was produced by extraction from thebark of the Pacific yew tree ( Taxus brevifolia ). It required three 100-year-old trees to supply enough paclitaxel to treat one patient. This tree is relatively uncommon, and its harvestationhad significant adverse environmental impacts. Harvestation of whole trees has been replacedby a method of semisynthesis. Needles and branches of more common yews can be collected,a precursor compound extracted, and the precursor chemically converted to paclitaxel. Thecollection of needles and branches can be done in a way to prevent death of the plant. How-ever, there are environmental concerns with both needle collection and disposal of solventsfrom the chemical processing. Production of paclitaxel in large-scale bioreactors provides aproduct with fewer contaminants, is highly controllable and reproducible, and is environ-mentally friendly. Commercial production of paclitaxel using large-scale bioreactors is nowa reality. Suspension cultures in stirred tank vessels of about 30000 l are used. The factory production of chemicals from plant cell tissue culture offers a number of important advantages: 1.Control of supply of product independent of availability of the plant itself. 2.Cultivation under controlled and optimized conditions. 3.Strain improvement with programs analogous to those used for microbial systems. 4.With the feeding of compounds analogous to natural substrates, novel compounds not present in nature can be synthesized. The production of the dye, shikonin, further illustrates these advantages. Japan could not grow sufficient Lithospermum to supply its needs, nor was it assured of a stable supply to 406 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Plant Cell Cultures Chap. 13TABLE 13.1 Examples of Plant Products of Potential strawberry, The plant had to grow for at least two to three years before reaching harvestable size; at harvest, about 1 %to 2 %of the dry weight was shikonin. Using a combination of strain se- lection and optimization of reactor conditions, a commercial process that could producecells with 14 wt %shikonin in a three-week batch cultivation period was established. However, the role of bioreactors in plant cell tissue is not limited to chemical pro- duction. Also, transgenic plant cell cultures can be used to produce proteins such as vac-cines. The production of propagules or of artificial seeds may be economically important.The use of efficient submerged cultivation devices to generate elite plants may replace thecurrent labor-intensive processes for the micropropagation of plants. Whether the product is a chemical or a new plant, the bioprocess engineer must be- come familiar with some basic characteristics of plants and their implications for reactordesign. 13.2. PLANT CELLS IN CULTURE COMPARED TO MICROBES Plant cells in culture are not microbes in disguise. Aspects of plant cell structure and physiology were discussed in Chapter 2. See Fig. 13.1 for a summary of plant cell struc-ture. The primary difference between plant cells and microbes is the ability of the cells to Sec. 13.2 Plant Cells in Culture Compared to Microbes 407 Figure 13.1. (Left) Cross section of a plant cell enlarged about 9000 times its actual size by an electron microscope. (Right) The labeled drawing identifies some of the cell's structures and or-ganelles, those specialized cell parts that resemble and function as organs. This particular cell is abundle sheath cell from the leaf of a Zea mays plant. Cells like this one are part of the veins of the leaf and completely surround the water- and food-conducting tissues (xylem and phloem) of theveins. (With permission, from Michael A. Walsh, Utah State University.)ch13 10/11/01 5:52 PM Page 407undergo differentiation and organization even after extended culture in the undifferenti- ated state. The capacity to regenerate whole plants from undifferentiated cells under ap-propriate environmental conditions is called totipotency . This capacity is essential to plant micropropagation and is often associated with secondary metabolite formation. If wecould do the same for animals as we can for many plants, we could remove a cell from thereader's tongue and generate millions of nearly identical clones of the reader's wholebody! Let us begin by considering the establishment of cell cultures for producing a particular chemical (see Fig. 13.2). Callus and suspension cultures have been established from hundreds of different plants. A callus can be formed from any portion of the whole plant containing dividing cells (Fig. 13.3). The excised plant material is placed on solidi-fied medium containing nutrients and hormones that promote rapid cell differentiation.The callus that forms can be quite large ( > 1 cm across and high) and has no organized structure. Although we speak of a callus as being dedifferentiated tissue , it contains a mix- ture of cell types. The sources of the initial tissue (root, shoot, and so on) can make somedifference as well. If we are interested in maximizing the formation of a particular com-pound, it is advisable to initiate the callus from a plant that is known to be a high pro-ducer. Even from the same batch of seeds, there may be considerable variation from plantto plant in their biosynthetic capacity. For both callus and suspension cultures, a chemically defined medium is used. Typi- cally, cultures, especially suspension cultures, are maintained in the dark. While exposureto light may be used to regulate expression of specific pathways, light is rarely used solelyto support growth as most cells are incapable of sustained photoautotrophic growth. 408 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Plant Cell Cultures Chap. 13 Figure 13.2. Suspension cultures can be established from many plants using this ap- proach. For some plants, the process can be reversed to generate whole plants from sus-pensions.ch13 10/11/01 5:52 PM Page 408Typical media use a carbon/energy source such as sucrose. Inorganic nutrients, vitamins, and \"hormones\" (or growth regulators) are included in media. Classes of plant hormonesthat are growth promoters are auxins, cytokinins, and giberellins. Most media contain atleast an auxin as naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) or 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and a cytokinin such as kinetin or benzyladenine (BA). Ethylene is a plant hor-mone and is typically produced by the culture itself. The establishment of suspension cultures (see Fig. 13.4) from callus is generally straightforward if the callus is friable (easily breaks into small pieces). A piece of callus is Sec. 13.2 Plant Cells in Culture Compared to Microbes 409 Figure 13.3. Calli of grape cultures. The plate on the left contains an unselected culture in which a few cells make high levels of reddish-purple pigments (anthocyanins).

The flask on the left is a culture with modest selection, while the culture on the right is highly selected for anthocyanin produc-tion.ch13 10/11/01 5:52 PM Page 409placed in a liquid medium in a shake flask. With gentle to moderate agitation, cells or small aggregates of cells will slough off. Typical conditions would be 27\u00b0C and a pH of5.5 in the dark. These suspended cells then replicate. After two or three weeks, the sus-pended cells are transferred to fresh medium, and large aggregates or residual callus arediscarded. Suspensions can grow to high cell densities (similar to applesauce). All suspen-sion cultures contain aggregates; however, it is possible to select for fine suspensions by discarding large aggregates at each subsequent transfer. The aggregates are due not so much to clumping as to the failure of progeny to sep- arate. Cell-to-cell communication is very important in plants. Normally, all cells in awhole plant are connected to one another by small pores called the plasmodesmata . The plasmodesmata allow the interchange of lower-molecular-weight compounds ( < 800 da) from the cytoplasm of one cell to another. The plasmodesmata are formed principally dur-ing cell division. Cells in aggregates can communicate with one another through plas-modesmata and also through diffusable species. For example, plants generate ethylene,which acts as a hormone. In a large aggregate, there will be concentration gradients ofsuch metabolic products as well as nutrients (e.g., oxygen and hormones). These gradientslead to a wide variety of microenvironments and, as a consequence, cells in different posi-tions in the aggregates may have greatly different biochemical and morphological struc-ture. Although plant cell cultures are pure cultures in the sense that only one species ispresent (ideally one genotype), it behaves very much like a mixed culture. A mix of celltypes may be necessary for the formation of some products. Cells in suspension can be made to undergo differentiation and organization if the correct environmental conditions can be found. Nutrient and hormone levels must be ad-justed. Embryos, shoots, and roots can be made from aggregates in suspension. However,let us turn our attention from aggregates back to individual cells. Plant cells can be very large, with cell diameters typically in the range of 10 to 100 mm. They grow slowly, with doubling times typically ranging from 20 to 100 h. Growth is usually nonphotosynthetic, with sucrose or glucose supplied exogenously as the carbonand energy source. Typical respiration rates are roughly 0.5 mmol O 2/h-g dry weight or about 5 %to 15 %of that in E. coli . Plant cells can often be cultivated at very high densi- ties, up to 70 %of the total reactor volume as cells. Although the respiration rate is low, high cell density requires very good oxygen-transfer capabilities in a reactor. Plant cells contain a higher percentage of water than bacterial cells (90 %to 95 % versus 80 %). This higher water content is due, in part, to the presence of the central vac- uole, which can occupy as much as 95 %of the intracellular volume in extreme cases. Plant cells tend to secrete relatively few compounds, but sequester them inside the vac-uole. Many of these compounds are secondary metabolites of commercial interest; manywould also be cytotoxic if not removed from the cytoplasm. Their intracellular storagewill have important implications in our later discussions on bioreactor strategies. One other biological aspect of critical importance is the role of elicitors . In whole plants, there are a number of defensive mechanisms that plants use to contain attacks frompathogenic fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Defense mechanisms can be activated if break-down products of fungal or plant cell walls (oligosaccharides) are present. Other com-pounds, some even nonorganic, can also elicit a response. Many secondary metabolitesare involved in the plant's defensive mechanisms. The exposure of suspension culturesto elicitors has led in many cases to rapid increases in the accumulation of secondary 410 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Plant Cell Cultures Chap. 13ch13 10/11/01 5:52 PM Page 410products. The use of elicitors has been an important breakthrough in improving volumet- ric productivities in bioreactors. The most useful elicitor is methyl jasmonate. This com-pound is relatively inexpensive and readily introduced into large bioreactors. It regulatesexpression of a wide variety of plant genes. Recent advances in genomics and our understanding of plant molecular biology make it possible to consider genetically engineering the plant cell's biosynthetic path-ways. It will soon be possible to redirect these toward desired chemicals. 13.3. BIOREACTOR CONSIDERATIONS 13.3.1. Bioreactors for Suspension CulturesMany of the differences between plant cell cultures and microbes have direct implications for the design and scale-up of suspension culture systems (see Table 13.2). In particular,the degree of physical mixing that is desirable is important. However, the basic reactortypes we discussed in Chapter 10 can usually be adapted to plant cells. Plant cells are large, and when they are exposed to turbulent shear fields where the eddy size approaches the cell size, the cells can be exposed to a twisting motion that candamage them. Lower levels of shear appear to affect cell surface receptors and nutrienttransport. Reactors with high shear must be avoided. However, plants cells can withstandfar more shear than animal cells, and shear-tolerant lines can sometimes be developed.Stirred tanks designed for the culture of bacteria are not good choices, but modifiedstirred tanks can be suitable. Reactors up to 75000 l have been used successfully. Plant cell cultures can achieve high cell densities and viscosities. Their reduced res- piration rate, however, compensates in part for the need for vigorous agitation. Airlift re-actors for low or moderate cell densities ( < 20 g dry wt/l) or paddle-type or helical-ribbon impellers for high-cell-density systems have been advocated as reactors that strike a goodcompromise between the need for good mixing and the shear sensitivity of plant cells. More important than actual shear damage is the role that mixing plays in the biolog- ical response of some systems to scale-up. In at least some cases, the formation of aggre-gates appears to be necessary to achieving the mix of cell types essential for good Sec. 13.3 Bioreactor Considerations 411TABLE 13.2 Differences between Plant Cells and Microbes and the Implications for Bioreactor Design Differences Implications for reactor design Lower respiration rate Lower O2transfer rates required More shear sensitive May require operation under low-shear conditionsCells often grow as aggregates or clumps May have mass transfer limitations that limit the availability of nutrients to cells within the aggregate Degree of aggregation may be important with May be an optimal aggregate size for product regard to secondary metabolism synthesis V olatile compounds may be important for cell May need to sparge gas mixtures metabolism (e.g., CO2or ethylene) With permission, from G.

Since the degree of mixing necessary to achieve equivalent oxygen trans-fer or equivalent shear changes upon scale-up, the degree of aggregation and productivitymay change (see Fig. 13.5). Mixing depends on a combination of sparging and mechanical agitation. Oversparg- ing can be a problem for plant cell cultures. Even though photoautotrophic growth is notimportant in most cultures, elevated CO 2levels can enhance productivity. Plants make at least one volatile hormone, ethylene, and its rapid removal can affect productivity. Withplant cell cultures, optimizing the gas composition, sparging rate, and degree of mechani-cal agitation is a difficult problem. The low growth rates of plant cells present other problems for large-scale systems. The primary problem is maintenance of aseptic conditions for the two to four weeks oftennecessary to complete a fermentation. Additionally, the low growth rates reduce volumet-ric productivities to levels that diminish the economic attractiveness of plant cell cultures. A further problem is the apparent genetic instability of many cell lines. Often, sus- pension and callus cultures will produce a desired compound initially, but after three tosix months the capacity to make the product often decreases considerably. This loss ofproductivity may be due to inadequate nutrition or may have a genetic or epigenetic basis.Artificial cell culture tends to select for cells with higher ploidy levels (tetraploid insteadch13 10/11/01 5:52 PM Page 412of diploid). Cryopreservation of cell lines is not possible in all cases, and many cell lines must be maintained through routine subculture. This loss of activity can be counteracted in many cases by the active selection of productive subclones. Selection is facilitated when the product of interest is readilyvisible. In cases where extensive screening and selection have been done, stable, high-producing clones have been reported. A stable, high-producing cell line is essential to anycommercial process. One strategy that has proved to be useful in increasing productivity has been the use of a two-phase culture. The first phase uses a medium optimized for growth, while a sec-ond phase uses a different medium optimized for product formation. The first commercialprocess with plant cell culture has been shikonin production, which utilizes two batch re-actors in series. 13.3.2. Reactors Using Cell ImmobilizationFurther improvements in productivity may be possible due to cell immobilization. Immo- bilized-cell reactors inherently follow the two-phase approach. Cells are grown and thenimmobilized; once immobilized, conditions for product formation are optimized. Immobi-lized-cell systems are advantageous when continuous operation is possible and if theproduct is, or can be made, extracellular. Some advantages and disadvantages of immobi-lization are given in Table 13.3. Probably the most important advantage is that the degreeof cell-to-cell interaction can be manipulated. Plant cells will often self-immobilize by preferentially attaching to or within a porous matrix. The resulting biofilm (if on a surface) has been shown to be very effectivein a number of cases. Plant cells have also been entrapped in gels or between membranes.Immobilization generates concentration gradients that alter the biosynthetic capacity ofthe culture (sometimes negatively and sometimes positively). The cell-to-cell contact dueto immobilization or the contact of the cell surface with the surrounding gel phase mayalso alter cell physiology. In some cases, immobilization has improved intrinsic produc-tion rates by more than an order of magnitude. Plant cell cultures can be cultivated at three levels of cell-to-cell communication. In a fine suspension, aggregates are small and mass transfer gradients are unimportant. Anydiffusable species that might act as chemical messengers are diluted to a low concentra-tion. Plasmodesmata interconnect only a small fraction of the cells. If cells are concen-trated and entrapped, they form a pseudotissue; since the entrapping matrix is typically onthe order of 1 to 10 mm, mass transfer gradients become important. Diffusable chemicalspecies can build to high local concentrations because of mass transfer resistances. How-ever, plasmodesmata are relatively unimportant in pseudotissues. If a few cells are immo-bilized (say, between two membranes or in the pockets of a foam matrix) and allowed togrow in place, they will develop a tissuelike structure. Not only can diffusable species ac-cumulate, but cells will be interconnected through the plasmodesmata. Then immobiliza-tion (and the method used for immobilization) can be used as an engineering designparameter to alter the degree and type of cell-to-cell communication. Immobilization canbe coupled with other strategies to enhance product formation.

Ajmalicine has a pKa of 6.3, so that at the growth pH (5.6) much of the alkaloid is in the neutral form. A neutral resin can be used to remove aj-malicine in situ. The in situ removal of the product can enhance formation of a product by relief of feedback inhibition or protection from degradation or further conversion. Figure 13.6 shows the results of experiments involving combinations of in situ ad- sorption, use of a fungal elicitor, immobilization in calcium alginate gels, and the use of aproduction medium. Using all four approaches increases extracellular concentrations al-most 100-fold. The purity is high. The closely related alkaloid, serpentine, has a muchhigher pKa (10.8) and will not adsorb into the resin. The adsorption of ajmalicine in-creases its synthesis preferentially. Under some circumstances, the intracellular levels ofajmalicine and serpentine are nearly equal. In this system, the ratio of extracellular aj-malicine to serpentine was 60-fold, with serpentine accounting for a vanishingly smallamount of the adsorbed alkaloid. Perhaps the most important result of such an experimentis that at least some normally intracellular compounds can be excreted from viable cellswhen environmental conditions are correctly manipulated. 13.3.3. Bioreactors for Organized Tissues In many cases, neither suspension nor immobilized-cell cultures will produce satisfactory amounts of a desired metabolite. However, organ cultures from the same plant may givegood yields (Table 13.4). In addition to high yields, organ cultures have a number of dis-tinct advantages (Table 13.5). 414 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Plant Cell Cultures Chap. 13TABLE 13.3 Potential Advantages and Problems of Large-scale Immobilized Plant Cell Cultures Potential advantages Continuous operation facilitatedHigh cell concentrationsCell reuse may lead to increased efficiencyCells can be protected from shearOnce immobilized, the slow growth and strain instability of plant cells are no longer problemsMedia can be easily changed, which would be important for processes that require a series of media for optimal production Continuous removal of inhibitory metabolites may enhance the overall cellular metabolism or unmask biochemical pathways May be able to better exploit the biological relationships between aggregation, morphological differentiation, and secondary metabolite production Potential problems Large-scale aseptic immobilization procedures must be developedMass transfer limitations may significantly affect cell metabolism (positively and adversely)Products must be produced by nongrowing cellsProducts must be released from the cell into the medium Experience in the scale-up of immobilized-cell systems is limited With permission, from G.

TABLE 13.4 Examples of Compounds Made in High Yields in Organ Culture But Not in Corresponding Callus or Suspension Culture Compound Plant Form of culture Page 415The primary disadvantages for organ cultures have been their apparently slow growth rates and difficulties in designing effective bioreactors to handle organized tissues.Recent advances suggest that both limitations may be circumvented, and in several cases,organ cultures that grow more rapidly than their corresponding suspension cultures havebeen found. Some plants (some dicots, but no monocots) will respond to infection by Agrobac- terium rhizogenes with rapid root proliferation. This infection leads to hairy roots . The best doubling times for hairy root cultures approach or exceed typical values for manysuspension cultures. Even in species not susceptible to A. rhizogenes infection, recent results indicate that proper control of hormone content can accelerate growth rates to ac-ceptable levels (three- to five-day doubling times). The biggest difficulty with the large-scale culture of roots is the formation of root mats . These mats restrict internal mass transfer, can entrap gas and float, and present significant problems in maintaining a scal-able uniform environment. However, large-scale units for root culture have been built(20000 l for ginseng roots in Japan). Laboratory-scale reactors using a mist or forced con-vection of liquid nutrients appear promising and provide much better mass transfer in thecenter of root mats. One other advantage of using organ cultures over whole plants is the possibility of using precursor feeding and elicitors. For example, with species of onion and garlic, theuse of precursors can greatly enhance the formation of flavor compounds. Different pre-cursors give different levels of enhancement to particular components of the flavor spec-trum. By using combinations of chemical precursors, it may be possible to custom-makeflavors for specific applications. Shoot cultures present additional problems. Light may be required for some shoot cultures, while roots can be grown easily in the dark. Shoot cultures may be mixotrophic , involving the exogenous supply of sugars as well as some photosynthesis. In some cases,control of the photoperiod (hours of exposure to light per day) is important. However, the most crucial need for light comes from the role that light often plays in cellular regulation.Exposure to light of certain wavelengths is essential to induce synthesis of some enzymes.In at least some cases, these enzymes play a crucial role in secondary metabolism. Themaintenance of uniform light intensity in a large reactor is a challenging and partially un-solved problem. One other perceived limitation on shoot cultures has been the belief that they could not be grown under totally submerged conditions. Recent experiments have shown that 416 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Plant Cell Cultures Chap. 13TABLE 13.5 Advantages and Disadvantages of Organ Cultures Advantages Biosynthetic capacity often returns upon organogenesis.Product spectrum for flavors and fragrances returns to that for parent plant.Product secretion is enhanced in many cases (particularly root cultures).Genetic stability under growth conditions is greatly improved over callus or suspension culture.Self-immobilization; provides more optimal mix of cell types. Disadvantages Growth rates may be lower than suspension cultures in some, but not all cases.Efficient, scalable reactors for organized tissues need to be developed. Control of microenvironmental conditions is often more difficult.ch13 10/11/01 5:52 PM Page 416tobacco shoots will grow as well in submerged culture as a standard shake flask (three- day doubling time in both cases), provided that the liquid phase is well mixed. In Israel,commercial production of plantlets using totally submerged culture has been reported. Although organ cultures have not yet been extensively exploited, they are promising vehicles for the production of some important secondary metabolites. 13.4. ECONOMICS OF PLANT CELL TISSUE CULTURES Far fewer commercial processes for plant cell culture have been established than for bac- terial, fungal, or animal cell cultures. Currently, four large-scale systems have been con-structed in Japan and South Korea (1200 to 30,000 l) and one in Germany (75,000 l). InNorth America, the possible commercial development of three products is under activeconsideration. As a rule of thumb, most commercial fermentations yield a revenue of about 20 \u00a2/l-day. If the volumetric productivity of a process is known, the wholesale price neces-sary to achieve this level of revenue can be estimated. Table 13.6 lists the published valuesof the volumetric productivities reported for some of the more intensely studied cell lines.Bulk prices in excess of $220/kg would be necessary to yield 20 \u00a2/l-day for theseproducts. 13.5. SUMMARY Plants produce a wide range of commercially important compounds. For some of these chemicals, plant cell tissue culture is a potential technique for their production. In addi-tion, the bioreactor techniques that are applied to plant cell culture will be useful in themicropropagation of plants.

The first phase is used to promote growth, and a secondphase is optimized for product formation. Liquid suspensions can be cultured analogouslyto fermenters for microbes, if the special characteristics of plant cells are taken into ac-count. Alternatively, immobilized or entrapped cell systems can be used. In either case,elicitors can often be used to enhance product formation. A combination of immobiliza- tion and in situ separation techniques can often dramatically improve production. Organized tissues (shoots, roots, and embryos) hold promise as techniques to im- prove yields. However, bioreactor designs that supply homogeneous environments fororgan cultures are only now being developed. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER READING Overview on plant physiology SALISBURY , F. B., AND C.

PROBLEMS 13.1. The uptake of the auxin, indole acetic acid (or IAA), by suspension cultures of Parthenocis- sussp. is nearly zero order at 1 nmol/mg dry cell weight-min. The diffusivity of IAA in water 418 Bioprocess Considerations in Using Plant Cell Cultures Chap. 13ch13 10/11/01 PM Page 418is 5 \u00a510-6cm2/s. Beads of calcium alginate are most conveniently made as spheres with a 4-mm diameter. Assume the beads are made 25 %by volume of plant cells. Assume the plant cells are 90 %water and that the diffusivity of IAA in the gel is the same as in water. If the ex- ternal concentration is maintained at 2 mmol, will IAA penetrate to the center of the bead? 13.2. Gel-immobilized cells of Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) can make codeine from codeinone. The rate of codeinone uptake is first order, with a rate constant of 3.3 \u00a510-8l/g cells dry weight-s. The diffusivity of codeinone in the gel is 0.2 \u00a510-9m2/s.

INTRODUCTION In Chapter 8 we discussed how cells could be genetically engineered. The techniques of genetic engineering are fairly straightforward; the design of the best production system isnot. The choice of host cell, the details of the construction of the vector, and the choice ofpromoter must all fit into a processing strategy. That strategy includes plans not only forefficient production but also for how a product is to be recovered and purified. The devel-opment of processes for making products from genetically engineered organisms requiresthat many choices be made. Any choice at the molecular level imposes processing con-straints. As indicated in Fig. 14.1, an interdisciplinary team approach to process develop-ment is necessary to make sure that a well-designed process results. In this chapter we will discuss some of the questions that must be considered in building processes using genetically engineered cells. 14.2. HOW THE PRODUCT INFLUENCES PROCESS DECISIONS Genetically engineered cells can be used to make two major classes of products: proteins and nonproteins. Nonprotein products can be made by metabolically engineering cells,inserting DNA-encoding enzymes that generate new pathways or pathways with anch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 421enhanced capacity to process the precursors to a desired metabolite. However, most cur- rent industrial emphasis has been on proteins. Table 14.1 lists examples. The majority ofthese proteins are human therapeutics, but proteins that can be used in animal husbandry,in food processing, or as industrial catalysts are of interest. Sales in the United States forthese products are forecasted to be $32 billion in 2006. Over 200 other proteins are inclinical trials. With therapeutic proteins that are injectable, the prime concern is the clinical effi- ciency of the product. Such products must be highly pure, since strong immunogenic re-actions by patients or other side effects can be disastrous. The authenticity of the productis often critical. Correct or near correct posttranslational processing of the protein (e.g.,glycosylation or phosphorylation) is sometimes essential to its therapeutic action. Anyvariant forms of the protein (e.g., the modification of side groups on amino acids) arehighly undesirable and present very difficult purification problems. The processing challenges in making therapeutic proteins are to ensure product quality and safety. Process efficiency to reduce manufacturing cost, although important, isof less concern, since these products are required in relatively small amounts, becausethey can command high prices, and because the selling price is much more determined bythe costs of process development and regulatory approvals, particularly clinical trials.Thus, for these products the choice of biological system and processing equipment is dic-tated by the need to produce highly purified material in an absolutely consistent manner. Other protein products are purchased strictly on an economic basis, and manufac- turing costs play a much more critical role in the viability of a proposed process. In thiscase, regulatory demands are of lesser importance than in the production of therapeuticproteins. For animal vaccines or animal hormones, the products must be very pure andrender favorable cost ratios. For example, the use of bovine somatropin to increase 422 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14 Figure 14.1. Biocatalyst and bioreactor design are strongly interconnected. Choices made at the molecular level can have profound effects on bioreactor design. A multidisci-plinary approach is necessary to ensure that a well-designed process is developed.ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 422milk production requires that the increased value of the milk produced be substantially greater than the cost of the hormone and any increase in feed costs due to increased milkproduction. For food use, product safety is important, but purity requirements are less stringent than for an injectable. The volume of the required product is often substantial (severalmetric tons per year), and price is critical because alternative products from naturalsources may be available. Proteins used as specialty chemicals (e.g., adhesives and en-zymes for industrial processes) usually can tolerate the presence of contaminating pro-teins and compounds. The manufacturing costs for such proteins will greatly influence themarket penetration. For nonprotein products based on metabolically engineered cells, processing costs compared to costs of other routes of manufacture (usually nonbiological) will determinethe success of such a process. As the reader has certainly noted, the constraints on production can vary widely from one product class to another. These constraints determine which host cells, vectors,genetic constructions, processing equipment, and processing strategies are chosen.

GUIDELINES FOR CHOOSING HOST-VECTOR SYSTEMS 14.3.1. OverviewThe success or failure of a process often depends on the initial choice of host organism and expression system. Such choices must be made in the context of a processing strategy. Table 14.2 summarizes many of the salient features of common host systems. The most important initial judgment must be whether posttranslational modifications of theproduct are necessary. If they are, then an animal cell host system must be chosen. If somesimple posttranslational processing is required (e.g., some forms of glycosylation), yeastor fungi may be acceptable. Whether posttranslational modifications are necessary forproper activity of a therapeutic protein cannot always be predicted with certainty, andclinical trials may be necessary. Another important consideration is whether the product will be used in foods. For example, some yeasts (e.g., S. cerevisiae ) are on the FDA GRAS list ( generally regarded as safe), which would greatly simplify obtaining regulatory approval for a given product. In some cases edible portions of transgenic plants can be used to deliver vaccines or thera-peutic proteins. 14.3.2 . Escherichia coli If posttranslational modifications are unnecessary, E. coli is most often chosen as the ini- tial host. The main reason for the popularity of E. coli is the broad knowledge base for it . E. coli physiology and its genetics are probably far better understood than for any other 424 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14TABLE 14.2 Characteristics of Selected Host Systems for Protein Production from Recombinant DNA Organism Characteristic E. coli S. cerevisiae P . pastoris Insect Mammalian High growth rate EaVG VG P-F P-F Availability of genetic systems E G F-G F-G Expression levels E VG E G-E P-GLow-cost media available E E folding F F-G F-G VG-E ESimple glycosylation No Yes Yes Yes YesComplex glycosylation No No No Yes bYes Low levels of proteolytic degradation F-G G G excellent; good; bGlycosylation patterns differ from mammalian cells.ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 424living organism. A wide range of host backgrounds (i.e., combinations of specific muta- tions) is available, as well as vectors and promoters. This large knowledge base greatlyfacilitates sophisticated genetic manipulations. The well-defined vectors and promotersgreatly speed the development of an appropriate biological catalyst. The relatively high growth rates for E. coli coupled with the ability to grow E. coli to high cell concentrations ( > 50 g dry wt/l) and with the high expression levels possible from specific vector-promoter combinations (about 25 %to 50 %or more of total protein) can lead to extremely high volumetric productivities. Also, E. coli will grow on simple and inexpensive media. These factors give E. coli many economic advantages. An important engineering contribution was the development of strategies to grow cultures of E. coli to high cell densities. The buildup of acetate and other metabolic by-products can significantly inhibit growth. Controlled feeding of glucose so as to pre-vent the accumulation of large amounts of glucose in the medium prevents overflowmetabolism and the formation of acetate. Glucose feeding can be coupled to consumptionrate if the consumption rate can be estimated on-line or predicted. However, E. coli is not a perfect host. The major problems result from the fact E. coli does not normally secrete proteins. When proteins are retained intracellularly and produced at high levels, the amount of soluble active protein present is usually limited dueto either proteolytic degradation or insolubilization into inclusion bodies. The production of large amounts of foreign protein may trigger a heat-shock re- sponse. One response of the heat-shock regulon is increased proteolytic activity. In somecases, intracellular proteolytic activity results in product degradation at a rate nearly equalto the rate of production. More often, the target protein forms an inclusion body. Although the heterologous protein predominates in an inclusion body, other cellular material is also often included.The protein in the inclusion body is misfolded. The misfolded protein has no biologicalactivity and is worthless. If the inclusion bodies are recovered from the culture, the inclu-sion bodies can be resolubilized and activity (and value) restored. Resolubilization canvary tremendously in difficulty from one protein to another. When resolubilization isstraightforward and recoveries are high, the formation of inclusion bodies can be advanta-geous, as it simplifies the initial steps of recovery and purification. It is important that dur-ing resolubilization the protein be checked by several analytical methods to ensure that nochemical modifications have occurred. Even slight changes in a side group can alter theeffectiveness of the product. Other consequences of cytoplasmic protein production can be important. The intra- cellular environment in E. coli might not allow the formation of disulfide bridges. Also the protein will usually start with a methionine, whereas that methionine would have beenremoved in normal posttranslational processing in the natural host cell. If the product isretained intracellularly, then the cell must be lysed (broken) during recovery. Lysis usuallyresults in the release of endotoxins (or pyrogens) from E. coli. Endotoxins are lipo- polysaccharides (found in the outer membrane) and can result in undesirable side effects(e.g., high fevers) and death. Thus, purification is an important consideration. Many of the limitations on E. coli can be circumvented with protein secretion and excretion. Secretion is defined here as the translocation of a protein across the inner membrane of E. coli. Excretion is defined as release of the protein into the extracellular compartment. Sec. 14.3 Guidelines for Choosing Host-Vector Systems 425ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 425About 20 %of all protein in E. coli is translocated across the inner membrane into the periplasmic space or incorporated into the outer membrane. As the reader will recallfrom Chapter 4, secreted proteins are made with a signal or leader sequence. The presenceof a signal sequence is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for secretion. The signal sequence is a sequence of amino acids attached to the mature protein, and the signal se-quence is cleaved during secretion. Many benefits are possible if a protein is secreted. Secretion eliminates an unde- sired methionine from the beginning of the protein. Secretion also often offers some pro-tection from proteolysis. Periplasmic proteases exist in E. coli, but usually at a low level. They are most active at alkaline pH values, and pH control can be used to reduce targetprotein degradation. The environment in the periplasmic space promotes the correct pro-tein folding in some cases (including the formation of disulfide bridges). Proteins in theperiplasmic space can be released by gentle osmotic shock, so that fewer contaminatingproteins are present than if the whole cell were lysed. Even more attractive would be the extracellular release of target proteins. Normally, E. coli does not excrete protein (colicin and haemolysin are the two exceptions), but a va- riety of schemes to obtain excretion in E. coli are being developed. Strategies usually in- volve either trying to disrupt the structure of the outer membrane or attempting to use thecolicin or haemolysin excretion systems by constructing a fusion of the target protein withcomponents of these excretion systems. Excretion without cell lysis can simplify recoveryand purification even more than secretion alone, while achieving the same advantages assecretion with respect to protein processing. Excretion also facilitates the potential use ofcontinuous immobilized cell systems. Excretion of normally cytoplasmic or human-designed proteins is problematic. Two preliminary reports for the excretion of normally cytoplasmic proteins have been made,but the general principles for the extension of excretion to cytoplasmic proteins are stillbeing developed. At this time, the excretion of normally secreted proteins can be obtainedin E. coli (and other cells) even when the protein is derived from animal cells. However, extension to nonsecreted proteins is difficult. The lack of established excretion systems in E. coli has led to interest in alternative expression systems. Also, in some cases patent considerations may require the use of al-ternative hosts. 14.3.3. Gram-positive Bacteria The gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, is the best studied bacterial alternative to E. coli. Since it is gram positive, it has no outer membrane, and it is a very effective ex- creter of proteins. Many of these proteins, amylases and proteases, are produced commer-cially using B. subtilis. If heterologous proteins could be excreted as efficiently from B. subtilis, then B. subtilis would be a very attractive production system. However, B. subtilis has a number of problems that have hindered its commercial adoption. A primary concern has been that B. subtilis produces a large amount and variety of proteases. These proteases can degrade the product very rapidly. Mutants with greatlyreduced protease activity have become available, but even these mutants may have suffi-cient amounts of minor proteases to be troublesome. B. subtilis is also much more difficult to manipulate genetically than E. coli because of a limited range of vectors and promoters. 426 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 426Also, the genetic instability of plasmids is more of a problem in B. subtilis than in E. coli. Finally, the high levels of excretion that have been observed with native B. subtilis pro- teins have not yet been obtainable with heterologous protein (i.e., foreign proteins pro-duced from recombinant DNA). Other gram-positive bacteria that have been considered as hosts include Streptococ- cus cremoris and Streptomyces sp. These other systems are less well characterized than B. subtilis. Both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have limitations on protein process- ing that can be circumvented with eucaryotic cells. 14.3.4. Lower Eucaryotic Cells The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been used extensively in food and industrial fer- mentations and is among the first organisms harnessed by humans. It can grow to highcell densities and at a reasonable rate (about 25 %of the maximum growth rate of E. coli in similar medium). Yeast are larger than most bacteria and can be recovered more easilyfrom a fermentation broth. Further advantages include the capacity to do simple glycosylation of proteins and to secrete proteins. However, S. cerevisiae tends to hyperglycosylate proteins, adding large numbers of mannose units. In some cases the hyperglycosylated protein may be in-active. These organisms are also on the GRAS list, which simplifies regulatory approvaland makes yeast particularly well suited to production of food-related proteins. Generally, the limitations on S. cerevisiae are the difficulties of achieving high pro- tein expression levels, hyperglycosylation, and good excretion. Although the genetics ofS. cerevisiae are better known than for any other eucaryotic cell, the range of genetic sys- tems is limited, and stable high protein expression levels are more difficult to achieve thanin E. coli. Also, the normal capacity of the secretion pathways in S. cerevisiae is limited and can provide a bottleneck on excreted protein production, even when high expressionlevels are achieved. The methylotrophic yeasts, Pichia pastoris and Hansenula polymorpha, are very at- tractive hosts for some proteins. These yeasts can grow on methanol as a carbon-energysource; methanol is also an inducer for the AOX 1 promoter, which is typically used tocontrol expression of the target protein. Very high cell densities (e.g., up to 100 g/l) can beobtained. Due to high densities and, for some proteins, high expression levels, the volu-metric productivities of these cultures can be higher than with E. coli. Protein folding and secretion are, also, often better than in E. coli. These yeasts do simple glycosylation and are less likely to hyperglycosylate than S. cerevisiae. Like many host systems, their effec- tiveness is often a function of the target protein. The disadvantages of the methylotrophicyeast are due to the high cell density and rate of metabolism, which creates high levels ofmetabolic heat that must be removed and high oxygen demand. Effective induction of ex-pression, while maintaining cell activity, requires very good process control due tomethanol's dual rate as growth substrate and inducer. Further, high levels of methanol areinhibitory (i.e., substrate inhibition), which also demands good process control. Scale-upto large reactors often is very challenging, since heat removal, oxygen supply, and processcontrol are typically more difficult in large reactors with longer mixing times (see Chap- Sec. 14.3 Guidelines for Choosing Host-Vector Systems 427ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 427ter 10). Also, methanol is flammable, and handling large volumes of methanol is a safety concern. Nonetheless, these methylotrophic yeasts are of increasing importance. Fungi, such as Aspergillus nidulans and Trichoderma reesei, are also potentially im- portant hosts. They generally have greater intrinsic capacity for protein secretion thanS. cerevisiae. Their filamentous growth makes large-scale cultivation somewhat difficult. However, commercial enzyme production from these fungi is well established, and thescale-up problems have been addressed. The major limitation has been the construction ofexpression and secretion systems that can produce as large amounts of extracellularheterologous proteins as some of the native proteins. A better understanding of the secre-tion pathway and its interaction with protein structure will be critical for this system toreach its potential. All these lower eucaryotic systems are inappropriate when complex glycosylation and posttranslational modifications are necessary. In such cases, animal cell tissue culturehas been employed. 14.3.5. Mammalian Cells Mammalian cell culture is chosen when the virtual authenticity of the product protein must be complete. Authenticity implies not only the correct arrangement of all aminoacids, but also that all posttranslational processing is identical to that in the whole animal.In some cases, the cells in culture may not do the posttranslation modifications identicallyto those done by the same cell while in the body. But for bioreactor processes, mammaliancell tissue culture will provide the product closest to its natural counterpart. Another ad-vantage is that most proteins of commercial interest are readily excreted. Slow growth, expensive media, and low protein expression levels all make mam- malian cell tissue culture very expensive. As discussed in Chapter 12, a wide variety of re-actor systems are being used with animal cell cultures. Although many of these can improveefficiency significantly, processes based on mammalian cells remain very expensive. Several cell lines have been used as hosts for the production of proteins using re- combinant DNA. The most popular hosts are probably lines of CHO (Chinese hamsterovary) cells. In addition to the cost of production, mammalian cells face other severe constraints. Normal cells from animals are capable of dividing only a few times; these cell lines aremortal. Some cells are immortal or continuous and can divide continuously, just as a bac- terium can. Continuous cell lines are transformed cells. Cancer cells are transformed also (i.e., have lost the inhibition of cell replication). The theoretical possibility that a cancer-promoting substance could be injected along with the desired product necessitates extremecare in the purification process. It is particularly important to exclude nucleic acids from theproduct. The use of transformed cells also requires cautions to ensure worker safety. Additionally, the vectors commonly used with mammalian cell cultures have been derived from primate viruses. Again, there is concern about the reversion of such vectorsback to a form that could be pathogenic in humans. Most of these vectors cannot give high expression levels of the target protein in common host cells (usually < 5%of total protein). However, higher levels of expression can be obtained (e.g., > 100 mg/l of secreted, active protein) through amplification of number of gene copies. It may take six months with a CHO cell line to achieve stable, 428 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 428high-level expression. It is often easier to obtain high titers (or product concentration) when producing monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma cultures. While the quality of the protein product may change upon scale-up with any system, this issue is particularly important with animal cell cultures. This contention is due, in part,to the fact that animal cell cultures are used primarily because authenticity of the proteinproduct is a major concern. Since culture conditions (shear, glucose, amino sugars, DO, etc.)can change upon scale-up, the efficiency of cellular protein processing can change, alteringthe level of posttranslational processing. Further, it has been shown that protein quality maychange with harvest time in batch cultures. This change may be due to alterations in intra-cellular machinery, but often it is due to release of proteases and siladase (an enzyme that re-moves the silalic acid cap from glycosylated proteins) from dead cells. Also, excessive levelsof protein production may saturate the intracellular protein-processing organelles (i.e., ERand Golgi), leading to incompletely processed proteins. These problems can significantlyimpact process strategy. One well-known company has been forced to harvest 24 h early tomaintain the silalic acid/protein ratio specified for the product. Early harvest resulted in a30 %loss in protein concentration (as compared with delayed harvest). Strategies to reduce such problems include selection of cell lines or genetic manipula- tion of cell lines with reduced levels of siladase production or enhanced protein processingcapacity. Redesign of medium can be beneficial; chemicals that inhibit undesirable extra-cellular enzyme activity can be added or precursors added (e.g., amino sugars) to improveprocessing. Cell lysis can be reduced by adding genes (e.g., bcl2) to the host cell that reduce apotosis. An engineering solution is to remove the product from the medium as it is formed.For example, perfusion systems with an integrated product capture step can be used. 14.3.6. Insect Cell-Baculovirus SystemA popular alternative for protein production at small ( < 100 l) or laboratory scale is the in- sect cell-baculovirus system. This system is particularly attractive for rapidly obtainingbiologically active protein for characterization studies. Typical host cell lines come fromthe fall armyworm (Ac NPV), is used as a vector for insertion of recombinant DNA into the host cell. This virus has an unusual biphasic replication cycle in nature. An insect ingests the occluded form, in which multiple virus particles are embedded in a protein matrix. Theprotein matrix protects the virus when it is on a leaf from environmental stresses (e.g., UVradiation). This protein matrix is from the polyhederin protein. In the mid-gut of the in-sect, the matrix dissolves, allowing the virus to attack the cells lining the insect's gut; thisis the primary infection. These infected cells release a second type of virus; it is nonoc-cluded (no polyhederin matrix) and buds through the cell envelope. The nonoccludedvirus (NOV) infects other cells throughout the insect (secondary infection). In insect cell culture, only NOVs are infectious, and the polyhederin gene is un- necessary. The polyhederin promoter is the strongest known animal promoter and isexpressed late in the infection cycle. Replacing the polyhederin structural gene with thegene for a target protein allows high-level target protein production (up to 50 %of cellular protein). Proteins that are secreted and glycosylated are often made at much lower levelsthan nonsecreted proteins. Sec. 14.3 Guidelines for Choosing Host-Vector Systems 429ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 429In addition to high expression levels, the insect-baculovirus system offers safety ad- vantages over mammal-retrovirus systems. The insect cell lines derived from ovaries orembryos are continuous but not transformed. The baculovirus is not pathogenic towardeither plants or mammals. Thus, the insect-baculovirus system offers potential safetyadvantages. Another important advantage is that the molecular biology and high-levelexpression of correctly folded proteins can be achieved in less than a month. This system also has the cellular machinery to do almost all the complex posttrans- lational modifications that mammalian cells do. However, even when the machinery ispresent, at least some of the proteins produced in the insect cell-baculovirus system arenot processed identically to the native protein. In some cases, their slight variations maybe beneficial (e.g., increased antigenic response in the development of an AIDS vaccine),while in others they may be undesirable. While complex glycoforms (including silaicacid) have been made, it is more common to observe only simple glycoforms. Productionof complex forms requires special host cell lines and is sensitive to culture conditions. The insect cell-baculovirus system is a good system to illustrate a holistic perspec- tive on heterologous protein production. Any bioprocess for protein production is com-plex, consisting of the nonlinear interaction of many subcomponents. Thus the optimalprocess is not simply the sum of individually optimized steps. Figure 14.2 presents aholistic view for the insect cell-baculovirus system. Because of the viral component, thissystem is even more complex than most other bioprocesses, as the infection process andresulting protein expression kinetics must be considered. One factor is the ratio of infec-tious particles to cells (e.g., multiplicity of infection or MOI), which alters the synchronyof infection and the resulting protein expression kinetics. Another is the genetic design ofthe virus (which shares many of the general features of vector design). Also, the quality ofthe virus stock is important; if the virus stock is maintained incorrectly, mutant virus canform. One example is the formation of defective interfering particles (DIPs) that reduce protein expression in the culture by 90 %when high MOIs are used. You should work from the bottom of Fig. 14.2 toward the top. What is the desired product quality? What is the product worth? These questions then guide selection of bio-process strategies to achieve the cost and quality desired. To develop that strategy requiresan understanding of the basic kinetics and capabilities of the biological system. Under-standing these requirements guides selection of the specific host cell line, the medium,and the molecular design of the virus. For example, the addition of serum to the mediumof some Ti ni cell lines results in production of proteins with complex N-linked glycosyla- tion, including a sialic acid cap, which may be a requirement for product quality. How-ever, the use of serum alters growth kinetics, expression levels (often less), and thedifficulty of purification, which may alter cost. Such trade-offs need to be considered withrespect to alternative approaches (e.g., development of a genetically engineered host thatcould perform the same reactions, but in serum-free medium). 14.3.7 . T ransgenic Animals In some cases proteins with necessary biological activity cannot be made in animal cell culture. While posttranslational protein processes, such as N-linked glycosylation, can bedone in cell culture, other more subtle forms of posttranslational processing may not bedone satisfactorily. An alternative to cell culture is the use of transgenic animals. Animals 430 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 430are engineered to express the protein and release it into specific fluids, such as milk or urine. High concentrations of complex proteins can be achieved, and such approaches canbe cost effective for complex proteins. In these cases the role for the bioprocess engineeris in protein recovery and purification, although significant issues exist for agriculturalengineers and animal scientists in devising appropriate systems to obtain the protein-containing fluid (e.g., pig milking stations). While transgenic animals can be developedfrom many mammals, sheep, goats, and pigs are the primary species used commercially. There are significant limitations on this technology. In some cases, the protein of in- terest will cause adverse health problems in the producing animal. The use of animalsraises safety concerns with respect to virus or prion transmission. The process to generateand screen for high-producing animals is inefficient and costly (e.g., $100,000 for a goatand $500,000 for a cow). Perhaps surprisingly, not all of the complex posttranslational Sec. 14.3 Guidelines for Choosing Host-Vector Systems 431 Figure 14.2. Holistic perspective on heterologous protein production with the bac- ulovirus expression system.ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 431processing steps necessary to achieve the desired product occur when the protein is ex- pressed in milk, urine, or blood. Nonetheless, transgenic animals will be critical to pro-duction of some proteins. 14.3.8. T ransgenic Plants and Plant Cell CultureProteins, including many complex protein assemblies, such as antibodies and virus-like particles (as vaccines), can be made inexpensively in plants. Transgenic plants offer manypotential advantages in addition to cost. Since plant viruses are not infective for humans,there are no safety concerns with respect to endogenous viruses or prions. Scale-up isreadily accomplished by planting more acreage. The protein can be targeted for sterile,edible compartments, either reducing the need for rigorous purification or making it anideal vehicle for oral delivery of a therapeutic protein. Indeed, development of edible vac-cines for use in developing countries is being actively pursued. The disadvantages of transgenic plants are that expression levels are often low (1 % of total soluble protein is considered good), N-linked glycosylation is incomplete, andsome other mammalian posttranslational processing is missing. While inexpensive, witheasy scale-up, it takes 30 months to test and produce sufficient seed for unlimited com-mercial use. Such long lead times are undesirable. Further, environmental control on field-grown crops is difficult, so the amount (and possibly quality) of the product can vary fromtime to time and place to place. While many crops could be used, much of the commercial interest centers on trans- genic corn. Some corn products are used in medicinals, so there exist some FDA guide-lines (e.g., contamination with herbicides and mycotoxins), and there is considerableprocessing experience. Production costs vary with degree of desired purity. For high-purity material (95 %pure), a cost of about $4 to $8/g can be estimated. For higher-purity material (99 %) with full quality assurance and control, a cost of about $20 to $30/g is rea- sonable. At least two enzymes are being produced commercially from transgenic plants.Large-scale production of monoclonal antibodies (e.g., 500 kg/yr) for topical uses is beingconsidered. The use of plant cell cultures is also being explored. The primary advantage of such cultures over transgenic plants is the much higher level of control that can be exercisedover the process. Plant cell cultures, compared to animal cell cultures, grow to very highcell density, use defined media, and are intrinsically safer. 14.3.9. Comparison of StrategiesThe choice of host-vector system is complicated. The characteristics desired in the protein product and the cost are the critical factors in the choice. The dominant systems for com-mercial production are E. coli and CHO cell cultures. An interesting study of the process economics of these two systems for production of tissue plasminogen activator, tPA, hasbeen published by Datar, Cartwright, and Rosen. Their analysis was for plants making 11 kg/yr of product. The CHO cell process was assumed to produce 33.5 mg/l of product,while E. coli made 460 mg/l. The CHO cell product was correctly folded, biologically 432 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14Bio/Technology 11 :349 (1993).ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 432active, and released into the medium. The E. coli product was primarily in the form of in- clusion bodies, and thus biologically inactive, misfolded, and insoluble. The process toresolubilize and refold the E. coli product into active material requires extra steps. The re- covery process for the CHO cell material requires five steps, while 16 steps are requiredfor the E. coli process. The larger the number of steps, the greater the possibility of yield loss. Total recovery of 47 %with the CHO-produced material was possible compared to only 2.8 %for the E. coli -produced material. The extra steps in the E. coli process are for cell recovery, cell breakage, recovery of inclusion bodies, resolubilization of inclusion bodies, concentration, sulfination, refold-ing, and concentration of the renatured protein. The difficulty of these processes dependson the nature of the protein; tPA is particularly difficult. With tPA the concentration of tPAhad to be maintained at 2.5 mg/l or less, and refolding is slow, requiring 48 hours. A 20 % efficiency for renaturation was achieved. Many proteins can be refolded at higher concen-trations (up to 1 g/l) and much more quickly. For tPA the result is unacceptably largetanks and very high chemical usage. In this case, five tons of urea and 26 tons of guani-dine would be necessary to produce only 11 kg of active tPA. For tPA the required bioreactor volumes were 14,000 l for the CHO process and 17,300 l for the E. coli process. The capital costs were $11.1 million for the CHO process and $70.9 million for the E. coli process, with 75 %of that capital cost being required for the refolding tanks. Under these conditions, the unit production costs are $10,660/g forthe CHO process versus $22,000/g for the E. coli process. The rate of return on invest- ment (ROI) for the CHO process was 130 %versus only 8 %for the E. coli process. How- ever, if the refolding step yield were 90 %instead of 20 %,the overall yield would improve to 15.4 %,and the unit production cost would fall to $7,530 with an ROI of 85 %for the improved E. coli process at production of 11 kg/yr. If the E. coli plant remained the origi- nal size (17,300 l fermentor) so as to produce 61.3 kg/yr, the unit production cost woulddrop to $4,400/g. The cost of tPA from the CHO process is very sensitive to cost of serumin the medium. If the price of media dropped from $10.5/l to $2/l (e.g., 10 %to 2 %serum in the medium), the cost of the CHO cell product would drop to $6,500/g. A primary lesson from this exercise is the difficulty of making choices of host- vector systems without a fairly complete analysis. The price will depend on the protein, itscharacteristics, and intended use. Changes in process technology (e.g., low serum mediumfor CHO cells or protein secretion systems in E. coli ) can have dramatic effects on manu- facturing costs and choice of the host-vector system. 14.4. PROCESS CONSTRAINTS: GENETIC INSTABILITY There is a tension between the goal of maximal target-protein production and the mainte- nance of a vigorous culture. The formation of large amounts of foreign protein is alwaysdetrimental to the host cell, often lethal. Cells that lose the capacity to make the targetprotein often grow much more quickly and can displace the original, more productivestrain. This leads to genetic instability (see Fig. 14.3). Genetic instability can occur due to segregational loss, structural instability, host cell regulatory mutations, and the growth-rate ratio of plasmid-free or altered cells to Sec. 14.4 Process Constraints: Genetic Instability 433ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 433plasmid-containing unaltered cells. Genetic instability can occur in any expression sys- tem. We illustrate this problem by considering gene expression from plasmids in bacteria. 14.4.1. Segregational Loss Segregational loss occurs when a cell divides such that one of the daughter cells receives no plasmids (see Fig. 14.4). Plasmids can be described as high-copy-number plasmids (> 20 copies per cell) and low-copy-number plasmids (sometimes as low as one or two copies per cell). Low-copy-number plasmids usually have specific mechanisms to ensuretheir equal distribution among daughter cells. High-copy-number plasmids are usuallydistributed randomly (or nearly randomly) among daughter cells following a binomial dis-tribution. For high copy numbers, almost all the daughter cells receive some plasmids, buteven if the possibility of forming a plasmid-free cell is low (one per million cell divi-sions), a large reactor contains so many cells that some plasmid-free cells will be present(e.g., 1000 l with 10 9cells/ml yields 1015cells and 109plasmid-free cells being formed every cell generation). The segregational loss of plasmid can be influenced by many environmental factors, such as dissolved oxygen, temperature, medium composition, and dilution rate in achemostat. Many plasmids will also form multimers, which are multiple copies of the same plasmid attached to each other to form a single unit. The process of multimerizationinvolves using host cell recombination systems. A dimer is a replicative unit in which two separate plasmids have been joined, and a tetramer is a single unit consisting of four sepa- rate monomers fused together. 434 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14 Figure 14.3. Cells that contain plasmids (O) actively making protein (p) must direct many of their cellular resources away from growth and hence grow more slowly thanplasmid-free cells (that is, m +1<m+2<m-).ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 434Example 14.1. What fraction of the cells undergoing division will generate a plasmid-free cell if: a.All cells have 40 plasmids at division? b.All cells have enough plasmid DNA for 40 copies, but one-half of the plasmid DNA is in the form of dimers and one-fifth in the form of tetramers? c.Half of the cells have 10 copies of the plasmid and half have 70 copies (the average copy number is 40 as in case a)? Solution a.If we assume a random distribution at division, the probability of forming a plasmid-free cell is (14.1) where Zis the number of plasmid replicative units. For Z=40, P =1.8 \u00a510-12plasmid- free cells per division. b.If the total amount of plasmid DNA is equivalent to 40 single copies, we can determine the plasmid distribution from (14.2a) (14.2b) (14.2c) which implies that (14.3) The number of copies of replicative units is then (14.4a) (14.4b) since a dimer consists of two monomer equivalents and a tetramer of four monomer equivalents.1122 + 0 + = 24 total re plicative unitsMD T ++= //2 4 total replicative 1240 monomer plasmid equivalentsT= 1 5 2 monomer Genetic Instability 435 Figure 14.4. Segregational instability results when a dividing cell donates all itsplasmids to one progeny and none to theother.ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 435Equation 14.1 can then be applied to yield (14.5) c. When plasmids are not evenly distributed, the probability of forming a plasmid-free cell changes. In this case, (14.6) Note that although this population has the same average copy number as case a, the proba- bility of forming a plasmid-free cell is 5.4 \u00a5108greater. 14.4.2. Plasmid Structural Instability In addition to the problems of segregational instability, some cells retain plasmids but alter the plasmid so as to reduce its harmful effects on the cell (structural instability). Forexample, the plasmid may encode both for antibiotic resistance and for a foreign protein.The foreign protein drains cellular resources away from growth toward an end product ofno benefit to the cell. However, if the investigator has added antibiotics to the medium, thecell will benefit from retaining the gene encoding the antibiotic resistance. Normal muta-tions will result in some altered plasmids that retain the capacity to encode for desirablefunctions (for example, antibiotic resistance) while no longer making the foreign protein.In other cases, cellular recombination systems will integrate the gene for antibiotic resis-tance into the chromosome. Cells containing structurally altered plasmids can normallygrow much more quickly than cells with the original plasmids. A culture having under-gone a change in which the population is dominated by cells with an altered plasmid hasundergone structural instability. 14.4.3. Host Cell Mutations Mutations in host cells can also occur that make them far less useful as production sys- tems for a given product. These mutations often alter cellular regulation and result in re-duced target-protein synthesis. For example, if the promoter controlling expression of theforeign protein utilizes a host cell factor (e.g., a repressor), then modification of the hostcell factor may greatly modulate the level of production of the desired plasmid-encodedprotein. The lac promoter (see our discussion in Chapter 4 of the lac operon) can be in-duced by adding chemicals; for a lac promoter lactose or a chemical analog of lactose(e.g., IPTG or isopropyl- b- D-thiogalactoside) can be used. Such promoters are often used in plasmid construction to control the synthesis of a plasmid-encoded protein. If inductionof plasmid-encoded protein synthesis from this promoter reduces cellular growth rates (asin Fig. 14.2), then a mutation that inactivates lac permease would prevent protein induc-tion in that mutant cell. The lac permease protein is necessary for the rapid uptake of theinducer. Thus, the mutant cell would grow faster than the desired strain. Alternatively, ahost cell mutation in the repressor, so that it would not recognize the inducer, would makeinduction impossible.1 21 21 21 21) 7)PP10 70 00 0+ = [2 ] + [2 ] = 9.8 1 + 8.5 1 = 9.8 1(1- 0 (1- 0 -4 -22 -4\u00a5\u00a5 \u00a5P= 2 = 1.2 10(1- 4 436 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 436The key feature of this category of genetic instability is that a host cell mutation im- parts a growth advantage to the mutant, so that it will eventually dominate the culture. Inthis case the mutant cell will contain unaltered plasmids but will make very little of thetarget, plasmid-encoded protein. 14.4.4. Growth-rate-dominated Instability The importance of all three of these factors (segregational loss of plasmid, structural alter- ations of the plasmid, and host cell mutations) depends on the growth-rate differential ofthe changed cell-plasmid system to the original host-vector system. If the altered host-vector system has a distinct growth advantage over the original host-vector system, the al-tered system will eventually dominate (i.e., genetic instability will occur). The terms used to describe the cause of genetic instability are based on fairly subtle distinctions. For example, if genetic instability is due to segregational instability, wewould infer that the rate of formation of plasmid-free cells is high. In this case, the num-ber of plasmid-free cells would be high irrespective of whether the plasmid-free cells hada growth-rate advantage. If, on the other hand, we claimed that the genetic instability isgrowth-rate dependent, we would imply that the rate of formation of plasmid-free cells islow, but the plasmid-free cells have such a large growth-rate advantage that they outgrowthe original host-vector system. In most cases, growth-rate dependent instability and oneof the other factors (segregational loss, structural changes in the plasmid, or host cell mu-tations) are important. The growth-rate ratio can be manipulated to some extent by the choice of medium (e.g., the use of selective pressure such as antibiotic supplementation to kill plasmid-free cells) and the use of production systems that do not allow significant target-protein pro-duction during most of the culture period. For example, an inducible promoter can beturned on only at the end of a batch growth cycle when only one or two more cell dou-blings may normally occur. Before induction, the metabolic burden imposed by the for- mation of the target protein is nil, and the growth ratio of the altered to the originalhost-vector system is close to 1 (or less if selective pressure is also applied). This two- phase fermentation can be done as a modified batch system, or a multistage chemostat could be used. In a two-stage system, the first stage is optimized to produce viableplasmid-containing cells, and production formation is induced in the second stage. Thecontinual resupply of fresh cells to the second stage ensures that many unaltered cells willbe present. The problem of genetic instability is a more significant in commercial operations than in laboratory-scale experiments. The primary reason is that the culture must gothrough many more generations to reach a density of 10 10cells/ml in a 10,000 l tank than in a shake flask with 25 ml. Also, the use of antibiotics as selective agents may not be de-sirable in the large-scale system, owing either to cost or to regulatory constraints on prod-uct quality. In the next section we will discuss some implications of these process constraints on plasmid design. In the section following, we will discuss how simple mathematicalmodels of genetic instability can be constructed. Sec. 14.4 Process Constraints: Genetic Instability 437ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 43714.5. CONSIDERATIONS IN PLASMID DESIGN TO AVOID PROCESS PROBLEMS When we design vectors for genetic engineering, we are concerned with elements that control plasmid copy number, the level of target-gene expression, and the nature of thegene product, and we must also allow for the application of selective pressure (e.g., antibi-otic resistance). The vector must also be designed to be compatible with the host cell. Different origins of replication exist for various plasmids. The origin often contains transcripts that regulate copy number. Different mutations in these regulatory transcriptswill yield greatly different copy numbers. In some cases, these transcripts have temperature-sensitive mutations, and temperature shifts can lead to runaway replication in which plas- mid copy number increases until cell death occurs. Total protein production depends on both the number of gene copies (e.g., the num- ber of plasmids) and the strength of the promoter used to control transcription from thesepromoters. Increasing copy number while maintaining a fixed promoter strength increasesprotein production in a saturable manner. Typically, doubling copy numbers from 25 to 50will increase protein production twofold, but an increase from 50 to 100 will increase pro-tein production less than twofold. If the number of replicating units is above 50, pure seg-regational plasmid loss is fairly minimal. Most useful cloning vectors in E. coli have stable copy numbers from 25 to 250. Many promoters exist. Some of the important ones for use in E. coli are listed in Table 14.3. An ideal promoter would be both very strong and tightly regulated. A zerobasal level of protein production is desirable, particularly if the target protein is toxic tothe host cell. A rapid response to induction is desirable, and the inducer should be cheapand safe. Although temperature induction is often used on a small scale, thermal lags in alarge fermentation vessel can be problematic. Increased temperatures may also activate aheat-shock response and increased levels of proteolytic enzymes. Many chemical inducersare expensive or might cause health concerns if not removed from the product. Some pro-moters respond to starvation for a nutrient (e.g., phosphate, oxygen, and energy), but thecontrol of induction with such promoters can be difficult to do precisely. The recent isola-tion of a promoter induced by oxygen depletion may prove useful, because oxygen levelscan be controlled relatively easily in fermenters. Anytime a strong promoter is used, a strong transcriptional terminator should be used in the construction. Recall from Chapter 4 that a terminator facilitates the release ofRNA polymerase after a gene or operon is read. Without a strong terminator, the RNApolymerase may not disengage. If the RNA polymerase reads through, it may transcribeundesirable genes or may disturb the elements controlling plasmid copy numbers. In ex-treme cases, this might cause runaway replication and cell death. The nature of the protein and its localization are important considerations in achiev- ing a good process. To prevent proteolytic destruction of the target protein, a hybrid genefor the production of a fusion protein can be made. Typically, a small part of a protein na-tive to the host cell is fused to the sequence for the target protein with a linkage that canbe easily cleaved during downstream processing. Also, fusion proteins may be constructedto facilitate downstream recovery by providing a \"handle\" or \"tail\" that adheres easily to aparticular chromatographic medium. 438 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 438Another approach to preventing intracellular proteolysis is to develop a secretion vector in which a signal sequence is coupled to the target protein. If the protein is secretedin one host, it will usually be excreted in another, at least if the right signal sequence isused. Replacement of the protein's natural signal sequence (e.g., from an eukaryotic pro-tein) with a host-specific signal sequence can often improve secretion. The secretion process is complicated, and the fusion of a signal sequence with a normally nonsecreted protein (e.g., cytoplasmic) does not ensure secretion, although sev-eral cases of secretion of normally cytoplasmic proteins have been reported. Apparently,the mature form of the protein contains the \"information\" necessary in the secretionprocess, but no general rules are available to specify when coupling a signal sequence to anormally cytoplasmic protein will lead to secretion. To ensure the genetic stability of any construct and to aid in the selection of the de- sired host-vector combination, the vector should be developed to survive under selectivegrowth conditions. The most common strategy is to include genes for antibiotic resis-tance. The common cloning plasmid, pBR322, contains both ampicillin and tetracyclineresistance. Multiple resistance genes are an aid in selecting for human-designed modifica-tions of the plasmid. Another strategy for selection is to place on the vector the genes necessary to make an essential metabolite (e.g., an amino acid). If the vector is placed in a host that isauxotrophic for that amino acid, then the vector complements the host. In a medium without that amino acid, only plasmid-containing cells should be able to grow. Be-cause the genes for the synthesis of the auxotrophic factors can be integrated into the Sec. 14.5 Considerations in Plasmid Design to Avoid Process Problems 439TABLE 14.3 Strong E. coli Promoters Promoter Induction method Characteristicsa lacUV5 Addition of IPTG (about 5 %) tac As above Induction results in cell death ( > 30 %) Ipp-OmpA As above Suitable for secreted proteins (20 %) Ippp-5 As above Strongest E. coli promoter (47 %) trp Tryptophan starvation Relatively weak (around 10 %) lpL Growth at 42\u00b0C See text ( > 30 %) lpL/cltrp Addition of tryptophan Easily inducible large-scale production (24 %) att-nutL-p-att-N 10-Min at No product is synthesized before induction (on/off promoter) T7 promoter Addition of IPTG or viral infection As above ( > 35 %), low basal levels T4 promoter Viral infection Method of induction inhibits product degradation phoA Phosphate starvation Induction in large-scale production is complicated aTypical values of accumulated product as a percent of the total protein of induced cells are given in paren- theses.

Recall that an auxotrophic mutant would be unable to synthesize an essential compound on its own.ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 439chromosome or because of reversions on the parental chromosome, double auxotrophs are often used to reduce the probability of nonplasmid-containing cells outgrowing the de-sired construction. One weakness in both of these strategies is that, even when the cell loses the plas- mid, the plasmid-free cell will retain for several divisions enough gene product to provideantibiotic resistance or the production of an auxotrophic factor (see Fig. 14.5). Thus, cellsthat will not form viable colonies on selective plates (about 25 generations are required toform a colony) can still be present and dividing in a large-scale system. These plasmid-free cells consume resources without making product. Another related problem, particularly in large-scale systems, is that plasmid- containing cells may protect plasmid-free cells from the selective agent. For example,auxotrophic cells with a plasmid may leak sufficient levels of the auxotrophic factor thatplasmid-free cells can grow. With an antibiotic, the enzyme responsible for antibioticdegradation may leak into the medium. Also, the enzyme may be so effective, even whenretained intracellularly, that all the antibiotic is destroyed quickly in a high-density cul-ture, reducing the extracellular concentration to zero. Although genes allowing the place-ment of selective pressure on a culture are essential in vector development, the engineershould be aware of the limitations of selective pressure in commercial-scale systems. The other useful addition to plasmid construction is the addition of elements that improve plasmid segregation. Examples are the so-called parand cerloci. These elements act positively to ensure more even distribution of plasmids. The mechanisms behind theseelements are incompletely understood, although they may involve promoting plasmid-membrane complexes (the parlocus) or decreasing the net level of multimerization (the cerlocus). Recall from Example 14.1 that multimerization decreases the number of inde- pendent, inheritable units, thus increasing the probability of forming a plasmid-free cell. Any choice of vector construction must consider host cell characteristics. Proteo- lytic degradation may not be critical if the host cell has been mutated to inactivate all 440 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14 Figure 14.5. Newly born plasmid-free cells usually contain sufficient complementing factor (C) to withstand killing by a selective agent or starvation from the lack of a growthfactor. In this case, the plasmid-free cell undergoes three divisions before the comple-menting factor is reduced to an ineffective level.ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 440known proteases. Multimerization can be reduced by choosing a host with a defective re- combination system. However, host cells with a defective recombination system tend togrow poorly. Many other possible host cell modifications enter into considerations of howto best construct a vector for a commercial operation. These qualitative ideas allow us to anticipate to some extent what problems may arise in the maintenance of genetic stability and net protein expression. However, a gooddeal of research has been done on predicting genetic instability. 14.6. PREDICTING HOST-VECTOR INTERACTIONS AND GENETIC INSTABILITY Many of the structured mathematical models we discussed previously can be extended to include component models for plasmid replication. Such models can then predict howplasmid-encoded functions interact with the host cell. The quantitative prediction of thegrowth-rate ratio and the development of plasmid-free cells due to segregational lossescan be readily made. The most sophisticated models will predict the distribution of plas-mids within a population and even the effects of multimerization on genetic stability.These models are too complex to warrant discussion in an introductory course. We will consider some simple models that mimic many of the characteristics we discussed with models of mixed cultures. A number of simple models for plasmid-bearingcells have been proposed. The key parameters in such models are the relative growth ratesof plasmid-free and plasmid-containing cells and the rate of generation of plasmid-freecells (i.e., segregational loss). These parameters can be determined experimentally or evenpredicted for more sophisticated models of host-vector interactions. Let's consider how a simple model may be constructed and how the parameters of interest may be determined experimentally. The simplest model considers only two cell types: plasmid free ( n-) number concentrations of plasmid-free and plasmid- containing cells, respectively. The model assumes that all plasmid-containing cells areidentical in growth rate and in the probability of plasmid loss. This assumption is the sameas assuming that all cells have exactly the same copy number. As we showed in Example14.1, the actual distribution of copy numbers can make a significant difference on plasmidloss. Also, plasmid-encoded protein production is not a linear function of copy number, soassuming that all cells have the same copy number may lead to incorrect estimates of thegrowth rate of plasmid-bearing cells. The assumption of a single type of plasmid-bearingcell is a weak assumption, but other assumptions result in a level of complexity inconsis-tent with this book's purpose. However, models that recognize the segregated nature of theplasmid population are available in the research literature. Let us further restrict our initial considerations to a single-stage chemostat. Then (14.7) (14.8) dn dt n Dn - =m n Dn Rn++ + + +/ =m - - Sec. 14.6 Predicting Host-Vector Interactions and Genetic Instability 441This analysis is adapted from the paper of N. S. Cooper, M. E.

Rcan be represented by (14.10) where P=probability of forming a plasmid-free cell. Pcan be estimated by eq. 14.1 if the copy number is known or can be predicted with a more sophisticated structured-segregated model. A value for Pcould be estimated from an experimentally determined copy-number distribution as in Example 14.1c, which would be more realistic than as-suming a monocopy number. As we will soon see, Rcan be determined experimentally without a knowledge of copy number. Equations 14.7 through 14.9 assume only simple competition between plasmid- containing and plasmid-free cells. No selective agents are present, and the production ofcomplementing factors from the plasmid is neglected. The simplest assumption for cellu-lar kinetics is (14.11a) (14.11b) The situation can be simplified even more if we assume that after a few generations in a chemostat with constant operating conditions the total number of cells ( N t) is con- stant. This approximation will be acceptable in many cases as long as the metabolic bur-den imposed by plasmid-encoded functions is not too drastic and Dis less than 80% of either m +maxor \u00b5-max. For allowable dilution rates, these assumptions allow us to decouple the substrate balance (eq. 14.9) from immediate consideration. If we then add eqs. 14.7and 14.8, we have (14.12) Since N tis constant (14.13) at quasi-steady-state, eq. 14.12 becomes (14.14a) or (14.14b) where f+is the fraction of the total population that is plasmid-containing cells and f-is the fraction dt dn dt n n D n n+- + + - - + - += + - Engineered PM 442(14.15) Substituting eq. 14.15 14.7 after eq. 14.7 is divided by Ntyields (14.16) and, after rearrangement, (14.17) where (14.18) Equation 14.17 is a Bernoulli's equation. It can be solved in terms of a dummy vari- able v=1/f+, assuming a constant Dmand R.A constant Dmand Rwould be achieved only if the copy number distribution of plasmid-containing cells remained constant during theexperiment. Also, strictly speaking, the assumption of constant Dmis inconsistent with constant N t.This analysis is best applied to situations where Dmis not extremely large.

Once these parameters are known, eq. 14.21 canbe used to predict chemostat performance. However, the reader should recall the largenumber of assumptions that went into these expressions. Case 1 is the one relevant tomost commercial systems, where high expression levels are coupled with high-copy-number plasmids. Case 2 will occur only for low-copy-number plasmids that do not havea par locus or other stabilizing features. The results for case 3 must be applied very cau-tiously. For m -to be less than m+, selective pressure usually must be applied (e.g., antibi- otic resistance or auxotrophic hosts). Equations 14.7 and 14.8 do not recognize thepossibility of leakage of nutrients or enzymes, which would degrade the antibiotics. Ifthere were no leakage and the antibiotic-to-cell ratio were high enough to leave an effec-tive residual level of antibiotic, then the analysis for case 3 could be applied if m -were in- terpreted correctly. For a newly born plasmid-free cell, there will be a carry-over of thecomplementing factor, which will be gradually reduced by turnover and dilution (recallFig. 14.5). Thus, in the first generation after plasmid loss, m -may even be greater than m+, but m-will decrease from generation to generation until it becomes zero. The analysis from case 3 will give an effective average value of m-. Removal of many of these assumptions to yield a more realistic analysis increases complexity and makes the development of simple analytical expressions difficult. Let usconsider how this simple analysis may be used and how it can be extended. Example 14.2. The data in Table 14.4 were obtained for E. coli B/r-pDW17 at two different dilution rates in glucose-limited chemostats. The average plasmid copy number for pDW17 is about 40 to 50copies per cell. About 12 %of the total protein synthesized is due to the plasmid. The proteins are retained intracellularly in soluble form. Use these data to estimate Dm, R,and P. Solution Note that data on plasmid stability are usually given in terms of the number of generations, which is usually calculated as (ln 2)/ D =1 generation. Clearly, the trend of the data in Table 14.4 is a sigmoidal dependence of f -on time, which corresponds to growth-rate- dependent instability or a case 1 situation (see Fig. 14.6). Thus, we need to plot the data as lnf -versus time. Such a plot is given as Fig. 14.7. Recall that eq. 14.32, which gives the bounds on t,suggests that only data at intermediate times can be used to estimate Dmand R.In this case, data for 0.01 <f-<0.40 were used as a basis for the initial estimates of values of Dm and R.Equation 14.32 can be used later to check the appropriate data range. For D =0.3 h-1the slope, m,is 0.15 gen-1or 0.066 h-1, and is -5.3, For D =0.67 h-1, m 0.11 h-1, an intercept of -5.6 gives f-1=0.0037. Recall that, for case 1, m =D m and R=m(f-1-f-0). The value of f-0presents a problem, as an accurate value is difficult to determine experimentally when it is low (manycolonies must be plated to obtain any statistical accuracy). Rwill be maximal if f -0is as- sumed to be zero.

Thus, 448 Utilizing Physically, these changes in m+and m-could occur due to small changes in residual substrate concentra- tion. This observation implies that the assumption of constant Dmand Rused in integrating eq. 14.17 would determine P,recall that R=Pm+(eq. 14.10). A value for m+can be estimated from eq. 14.14b after some rearrangement to give (14.40) Values of m+and m-vary slightly during culture as a consequence of the assumption that dNt/dt =0.An average value of m+is (14.41) R,in units of 2. Thus,mm+=-D D/2Df =m ++ Dm- A change in the probability of segregational losses as a function of dilution rate cor- responds to the copy number, which also changes with dilution rate. The pDW17 plasmidhas an average copy number of about 40 to 50 in exponential growth in minimal medium. Consider eq. 14.1, which predicts the probability of plasmid loss by random segre- gation: (14.1) for Z=40 and P=1.8 \u00a510 -12, which is certainly less than the maximum value calculated in these experiments. Note from Example 14.1, however, that if the average copy numberwere distributed so that half the cells had 10 plasmids and half had 70, then the probabil-ity of plasmid loss would be 9.8 \u00a510 -4, which is very close to the maximum probabilities allowed by these experimental data.PZ=2(1- )ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 448Example 14.3.

Our discussion and examples so far have been for continuous reactors. For most in- dustrial applications batch or fed-batch operations will be used. While continuous reactorsare particularly sensitive to genetic instability, genetic instability can be a significant limi-tation for batch systems.

REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS ON GENETIC PROCESSES When genetic engineering was first introduced, there was a great deal of concern over whether the release of genetically modified cells could have undesirable ecological conse-quences. Reports in the popular press led to fears of \"genetic monsters\" growing in oursewers, on our farm lands, or elsewhere. Consequently, the use of genetic engineeringtechnology is strictly regulated. The degree of regulatory constraint varies with the nature of the host, vector, and target protein. For example, consider a scenario where serious harm might arise. The genefor a highly toxic protein is cloned into E. coli to obtain enough protein to study that pro- tein's biochemistry. Assume that a plasmid that is promiscuous (i.e., the plasmid will shut- tle across species lines) is used. Also assume that laboratory hygiene is not adequate and asmall flying insect enters the laboratory and comes into contact with a colony on a plateawaiting destruction. If that insect leaves the laboratory and returns to its natural habitat,then the target gene is accidentally released into the environment. Laboratory strains ofE. coli are fragile and usually will not survive long in a natural environment. However, a very small probability exists that the plasmid could cross over species lines and becomeincorporated into a more hardy soil bacterium (e.g., Pseudomonas sp.). The plasmid would most certainly contain antibiotic resistance factors as well. The newly transformedsoil bacterium could replicate. Many soil bacteria are opportunistic pathogens. If theyenter the body through a wound, they can multiply and cause an infection. If, in addition,the bacterium makes a toxic protein, the person or animal that was infected could die fromthe toxic protein before the infection was controlled. If the plasmid also confers antibioticresistance, the infection would not respond to treatment by the corresponding antibiotic,further complicating control of the spread of the gene for the toxin. This scenario requires that several highly improbable events occur. No case of sig- nificant harm to humans or the environment due to the release of genetically modifiedcells has been documented. However, the potential for harm is real. Regulations controlling genetic engineering concentrate on preventing the acciden- tal release of genetically engineered organisms. The deliberate release of genetically engi-neered cells is possible, but an elaborate procedure must be followed to obtain permissionfor such experiments. The degree of containment required depends on (1) the ability for the host to survive if released, (2) the ability for the vector to cross species lines or for a cell to be trans-formed by a piece of naked DNA and then have it incorporated into the chromosome viarecombination, and (3) the nature of the genes and gene products being engineered. Ex-periments involving overproduction of E. coli proteins in E. coli using plasmids derived from wild populations are readily approved and do not require elaborate containment pro-cedures (see Table 14.5). Experiments that would move the capacity to produce a toxinfrom a higher organism into bacteria or yeast would be subjected to a much more thor-ough evaluation, and more elaborate control facilities and procedures would be required. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have issued guidelines that regulate the use of recombinant DNA technology. Special regulations apply to large-scale systems(defined as > 10 l). There are three different levels of containment: BL1-LS, BL2-LS, and BL3-LS. BL1-LS (biosafety level 1, large scale) is the least stringent. Table 14.6 com-pares the requirements for the three containment levels. Sec. 14.7 Regulatory Constraints on Genetic Processes 451ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 451In all cases, no viable organisms can be purposely released. Gas vented from the fermenter must be filtered and sterilized. All cells in the liquid effluent must be killed. Thelatter can present some operating issues, since the inactivation of the host cell must bedone in such a way as not to harm what are often fragile products. Emergency plans anddevices must be on hand to handle any accidental spill or loss of fluid in the fermentationarea. These extra precautions increase manufacturing costs. The issue of the regulation of cells and recombinant DNA will undoubtedly undergo further refinement with time. Both laboratory and manufacturing personnel need to keepabreast of any such changes. 14.8. METABOLIC ENGINEERING Metabolic or pathway engineering uses the tools of genetic engineering to endow an or- ganism to make a totally new pathway, amplify an existing pathway, disable an undesiredpathway, or alter the regulation of a pathway. The principle motivations for metabolic en-gineering are the production of specialty chemicals (e.g., indigo, biotin, and amino acids),utilization of alternative substrates (e.g., pentose sugars from hemicellulose), or degrada- 452 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14TABLE 14.5 Minimum Laboratory Containment Standards for Working with Cells with Recombinant DNA Biosafety Level 1 (BL1) A. Standard Microbiological Practices 1. Access to the laboratory is limited or restricted at the discretion of the laboratory director when exper- iments are in progress. 2. Work surfaces are decontaminated once a day and after any spill of viable material.3. All contaminated liquid or solid wastes are decontaminated before disposal.4. Mechanical pipetting devices are used; mouth pipetting is prohibited.5. Eating, drinking, smoking, and applying cosmetics are not permitted in the work area. Food may be stored in cabinets or refrigerators designated and used for this purpose only. 6. Persons wash their hands after they handle materials involving organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules, and animals, and before leaving the laboratory. 7. All procedures are performed carefully to minimize the creation of aerosols.8. It is recommended that laboratory coats, gowns, or uniforms be worn to prevent contamination or soiling of street clothes. B. Special Practices 1. Contaminated materials that are to be decontaminated at a site away from the laboratory are placed in a durable,leakproof container that is closed before being removed from the laboratory. 2.

The same concepts form the basis for gene therapy. The reader may ask why genetically engineered organisms should be used instead of natural isolates. The potential advantages over natural isolates are as follows: Can put an \"odd-ball\" pathway under the control of a regulated promoter. The in- vestigator can turn on the pathway in situations where the pathway might normallybe suppressed (e.g., degradation of a hazardous compound to a concentration lowerthan necessary to induce the pathway in the natural isolate). High levels of enzymes in desired pathways can be obtained with strong promoters; only low activity levels may be present in the natural isolate. Pathways moved from lower eucaryotes to bacteria can be controlled by a single promoter; in lower eucaryotes, each protein has a separate promoter.

Can move a pathway from an organism that grows poorly to one that can be more easily cultured. The genetically engineered cell can be proprietary property. Cells that have engineered pathways face many of the same limitations that cells en- gineered to produce proteins face. Two issues that perhaps assume greater importancewith metabolic engineering are stability and regulatory constraints. Protein products are of high value and can be made in batch culture. Instability is avoided by inducing overproduction only at the end of the culture cycle. The productivephase is too short for nonproducers to grow to a significant level, and cells are not reused.With metabolically engineered cells, the same strategy is untenable. Lower product valuesnecessitate cell reuse or, at least, extended use. The use of antibiotics as selective agentsmay be undesirable because of contamination of product or cost. For a culture with a 1.5-h doubling time and a 20-h batch cycle, a continuous system has a 14-fold advantagein productivity over a batch system. Although the levels of protein overproduction arelower in metabolically engineered cells, they can experience as high a level of metabolicburden as \"protein producers\" because of the diversion of cellular building blocks tononessential metabolites. Also, if the cells are used to treat hazardous compounds, the ge-netically engineered cells will face competition from a natural flora. In addition to the need for extra efforts in engineering design to ensure genetic sta- bility, regulatory approval may be more difficult. If a genetically engineered cell is to beused to treat hazardous wastes, containment of the engineered organism is difficult or im-possible. Pump-and-treat scenarios for leachates allow the possibility of control. In situ use of such organisms would have to satisfy the constraints for deliberate release. 454 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14 Figure 14.8. Proposed pathway for indigo biosynthesis in a recombinant strain of E. coli. Indole is formed from tryptophan by tryptophanase, a natural enzyme in E. coli. Naphthalene dioxygenase formed by the expression of the cloned Pseudomonas DNA oxidizes indole to indigo; cis-2,3- dihydroxy-2,3-dihydroindole and indoxyl have not been isolated. Their inclusion is based on theknown activities of aromatic hydrocarbon dioxygenases and established mechanisms for the chemicalsynthesis of indigo. (With permission, from B. D. Ensley et al., Science 222: 167, 1983, and American Association for the Advancement of Science.)ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 454In addition to these two problems, engineering pathways require good quantitative information on the flow of metabolites in a cell. Structured models of cells can be used inconjunction with experiments to optimize the design of new pathways. Metabolic engi-neering has been a fertile area for engineering contributions. A goal of the engineering approach has been to develop rational design techniques for metabolical engineering. Due to the highly nonlinear, dynamic nature of a cell and itsmetabolism, uninformed changes intended to improve production of a specific compoundoften fail to give the desired result. The problem of metabolic engineering is to expressappropriate genes in the \"right\" amount. Too much of a key enzyme may result in littlechange, if it is not a rate-influencing step, as there is insufficient reactant to increase theflow of substrate (or flux) into the reaction product. If it is rate-influencing, the increased reaction of the substrate will alter fluxes of precursors in other pathways; sometimes thesechanges compromise the cell's ability to grow or to provide co-reactants when needed.Metabolic engineering (and gene therapy) require a delicate balance of activities and are aproblem of quantative optimization rather than simple maximization of expression of agene. Metabolic control theory and the closely allied activity of metabolic flux analysis are mathematical tools that can be applied to such problems. A flux balance equation con-sists of the product of a stoichiometric matrix and an intracellular flux vector to yield anoverall rate vector. Typically such equations are underdetermined and require assumptions(e.g., on energy stoichiometry) that may not be justified for a metabolically engineeredcell. However, improved experimental techniques to measure the intracellular flux vector(e.g., mass spectrometry) coupled with genomic/proteomic information may provide thedata to allow complete solution of the flux balance equations. One caution is that analysisof pathways in isolation can be misleading. An assumption of such analysis is that theproducts of the pathway do not influence inputs into that pathway. Given the complexityof a cell, it is difficult to assure that such an assumption is satisfied. Metabolic control theory is based on a sensitivity analysis to calculate the response of a pathway to changes in the individual steps in a pathway. This approach allows calcu-lations of flux control coefficients, which are defined as the fractional change of flux ex-pected for a fractional change in the amount of each enzyme. This process involves alinearization, so that flux coefficients can vary significantly if growth conditions and thecell's physiological step change. An important result of the application of this theory tomany cases is that it is rare for a single enzyme step to be rate-controlling. Typically sev-eral enzymatic steps influence rate. Maximization of flux through a particular pathwaywould require several enzyme activities to be altered simultaneously. The potential ofsuch analysis to contribute to rational design of microbes is clear, but not yet routinelyapplicable. Real progress has been made toward the industrial use of metabolically engineered cells. Processes to convert glucose from cornstarch into 1,3-propanediol, an importantmonomer in the polymer, polytrimethylene terepthalate, is poised for commercialization.A process to make 2-keto- L-gluconic acid as a precursor for vitamin C production is in the pilot stage (30,000 l), using metabolically engineered bacteria with glucose as a substrate.Other products from metabolically engineered cells may be new polyhydroxyalkanoates Engineering 455ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 45514.9. PROTEIN ENGINEERING Not only can cells be engineered to make high levels of naturally occurring proteins or to introduce new pathways, but we can also make novel proteins. It is possible to make syn-thetic genes encoding for totally new proteins. We are beginning to understand the rulesby which a protein's primary structure is converted into its three-dimensional form. Weare just learning how to relate a protein's shape to its functional properties, stability, andcatalytic activity. In the future, it may become possible to customize protein design to aparticular well-defined purpose. Protein engineering at present mainly involves the modification of existing proteins to improve their stability, substrate and inhibitor affinity and specificity, and catalytic rate.Generally, the protein structure must be known from x-ray crystallography. Key aminoacids in the structure are selected for alteration based on computer modeling, on interac-tions of the protein with substrates, or by analogy to proteins of related structure. Thetechnique used to generate genes encoding the desired changes in protein structure iscalled site-directed mutagenesis (see Fig. 14.9). Using this approach, any desired amino acid can be inserted precisely into the desired position. The reader may wonder why site-directed mutagenesis would be preferred to simple mutation-selection procedures. One reason may be that mutation followed by selection forparticular properties may be difficult when the alterations in protein properties are subtleand confer no advantages or disadvantages on the mutant cell. A second reason is thatsite-directed mutagenesis can be used to generate the insertion of an amino acid in a par-ticular location, while a random mutation giving the same result would occur so infre-quently as to be unobtainable. To make this point more evident, consider the degenerate nature of the genetic code. Each codon consists of three letters. The odds for mutation in one of these three letters isabout 10 -8per generation. The odds that two letters would simultaneously be altered is much lower (order of 10-16). The codon UAC (for tyrosine) could be altered by single- letter substitutions to give (tyrosine). Random mutants in this case are very unlikely to carry substitutionsfor 13 of the 20 amino acids. Thus, most of the potential insertions can be generated reli-ably only by using site-directed mutagenesis. The above approaches are directed toward the rational design of proteins. An alter- native, and often complementary, approach is that of directed evolution. This process is based on random mutagenesis of a gene and the subsequent selection of proteins with de-sired properties. Large libraries of mutant genes must be made so that the rare beneficialforms are present. A rapid screen or selection must be available to select those mutantswith the desired function or characteristics. One technique to generate mutants is the useof \"error-prone\" PCR. Another approach is DNA shuffling, which requires genes from ho-mologous proteins. Segments from the genes are recombined randomly to form chimericgenes. Proteins are typically selected for improved stability, binding strength, catalytic ac-tivity, or solubility. In some cases, the screen is for new activities based on ability to bindother molecules not normally bound by the native protein. These techniques combinedwith improved biochemical methods are leading to a better understanding of the relationof protein structure to function. Also, these techniques support the extension of protein 456 Utilizing Genetically Engineered Organisms Chap. 14ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 456catalysis to unusual environments, such as in organic media rather than in aqueous solutions. 14.10. SUMMARY The application of recombinant DNA technology at the commercial level requires a judi- cious choice of the proper host-vector system. E. coli greatly facilitates sophisticated genetic manipulations, but process or product considerations may suggest alternativehosts. S. cerevisiae is easy to culture and is already on the GRAS list, simplifying regula- tory approval, although productivities are low with some proteins and hyperglycosylation Sec. 14.10 Summary 457 Figure 14.9. The general approach to site-directed mutagenesis is depicted. For this ex- ample the amino acid, valine, at position 73 of a particular protein, is to be replaced withisoleucine. The first step is to clone the gene into the single-stranded DNA vector, M13,and collect a working amount of gene. In the second step, an oligonucleotide essentiallycomplementary to that region of the gene to be mutated is synthesized chemically. A typi-cal length for such an oligonucleotide is 18 residues. However, this synthetic oligonu-cleotide contains one mismatched nucleotide so as to cause the desired mutation. In thethird step, enzymes are added that complete the in vitro synthesis of a double-stranded vector. In the fourth step, the amount of double-stranded vector is amplified. In the laststep, cells with the mutant gene are detected by hybridization with the synthetic oligonu-cleotide.ch14 10/11/01 6:37 PM Page 457is a problem. P . pichia can produce very high concentrations of proteins, but the use of methanol presents challenges in reactor control and safety. Bacillus and the lower fungi may have well-developed secretion systems that would be attractive if they can be har-nessed. Animal cell culture is required when posttranslational modifications are essential.Mammalian cells offer the highest degree of fidelity to the authentic natural product.Insect cell systems potentially offer high expression levels and greater safety than mam-malian cells at the cost of a potential decrease in the fidelity of posttranslational process-ing. Transgenic animals are good alternatives for complex proteins requiring extensiveposttranslational processing. Transgenic plants and plant cell cultures are emerging asproduction systems for high-volume protein products. Plants are well suited to produceproteins for oral or topical delivery. A host-vector system is useful only if it can persist long enough to make commercially important product quantities. Genetic instability is the loss of the genetic information to make the target protein. Segregational instability arises when a plasmid-free cell is formed during cell division. Structured instability results when the cell loses the capacity to make the target protein in significant quantities due to changes in plasmid structure. Host-cell de- rived instability occurs when chromosomal mutations decrease effective plasmid-encoded protein production while the cell retains the plasmid. Growth-rate-dependent instability is a function of the growth-rate differential between plasmid-free and plasmid-containing cells;it is usually a determining factor in deciding how long a fermentation can be usefully main-tained. Simple models to evaluate genetic instability are available. The vector must be designed to optimize a desired process. Factors to be considered include vector copy number, promoter strength and regulation, the use of fusion proteins,signal sequences and secretion, genes providing selective pressure, and elements enhanc-ing the accuracy of vector partitioning. The engineer must be aware of the regulatory constraints on the release of cells with recombinant DNA. These are particularly relevant in plant design, where guidelines forphysical containment must be met. Deliberate release of genetically modified cells is pos-sible, but extensive documentation will be required. Two increasingly important applications of genetic engineering are metabolic or pathway engineering for the production or destruction of nonproteins and protein engi-neering for the production of novel or specifically modified proteins.

Assume that all plasmid-containing cells have eight plasmids; that an antibiotic is present in the medium, and the plasmid-containing cells are totally resistant; and that a newly born,plasmid-free cell has sufficient enzyme to protect a cell and its progeny for three generations.Estimate the fraction of plasmid-containing cells in the population in a batch reactor startingwith only plasmid-containing cells after five generations. 14.3. Consider an industrial-scale batch fermentation. A 10,000 l fermenter with 5 \u00a510 10cells/ml is the desired scale-up operation. Inoculum for the large tank is brought through a series ofseed tanks and flasks, beginning with a single pure colony growing on an agar slant. Assumethat a colony (10 6plasmid-containing cells) is picked and placed in a test tube with 1 ml of medium. Calculate how many generations will be required to achieve the required cell den-sity in the 10,000 l fermenter. What fraction of the total population will be plasmid-free cellsif m +=1.0 h-1, m-=1.2 h-1, and P=0.0005? 14.4. Assume that you have been assigned to a team to produce human epidermal growth factor (hEGF). A small peptide, hEGF speeds wound healing and may be useful in treating ulcers. Amarket size of 50 to 500 kg/yr has been estimated. Posttranslational processing is not essen-tial to the value of the product. It is a secreted product in the natural host cell. Discuss whatrecommendations you would make to the molecular-biology team leader for the choice ofhost cell and the design of a reactor. Make your recommendations from the perspective ofwhat is desirable to make an effective process. You should point out any potential prob-lems with the solution you have proposed, as well as defend why your approach should beadvantageous. 14.5. Develop a model to describe the stability of a chemostat culture for a plasmid-containing cul- ture. For some cultures, plasmids make a protein product (e.g., colicin in E. coli ) that kills plasmid-free cells but does not act on plasmid-containing cells. Assume that the rate ofkilling by colicin is k TCn-, where kTis the rate constant for the killing and Cis the colicin concentration. Assume that the colicin production is first order with respect to n+. 14.6. Consider the following data for E. coli B/r-pDW17 grown in a minimal medium supple- mented with amino acids.

It has been claimed that gel immobilization stabilizes a plasmid-containing population. A fac- tor suggested to be responsible for the stabilization is compartmentalization of the populationinto very small pockets. For example, the pocket may start with an individual cell and growto a level of 200 cells per cavity. Develop a mathematical formula to compare the number ofplasmid-free cells in a gel to that in a large, well-mixed tank. 14.8. You must design an operating strategy to allow an E. coli fermentation to achieve a high cell density ( > 50 g/l) in a fed-batch system. You have access to an off-gas analyzer that will mea- sure the pCO 2in the exit gas. The glucose concentration must be less than 100 mg/l to avoid the formation of acetate and other inhibitory products. Develop an approach to control theglucose feed rate so as to maintain the glucose level at 100 \u00b120 mg/l. What equations would you use and what assumptions would you make? 14.9. Develop a simple model for a population in which plasmids are present at division with copy numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. The model should be developed in analogy to eqs. 14.7 through14.9. You can assume that dividing cells either segregate plasmids perfectly or generate aplasmid-free cell. 14.10. Assume you have an inoculum with 95 %plasmid-containing cells and 5 %plasmid-free cells in a 2 l reactor with a total cell population of 2 \u00a510 10cells/ml.

INTRODUCTION With increasing knowledge of cellular and molecular biology, the boundary between tra- ditional bioprocess engineering and biomedical engineering has become increasinglyfuzzy. In this chapter we will consider areas in which bioprocess principles are critical tosolution of medical problems. Two important areas are tissue engineering and gene ther-apy using viral vectors. These are examples; other medical applications exist, and theirnumber will undoubtedly increase. Indeed, we have already mentioned the use of trans-genic plants as a source for edible vaccines and the techniques of microfabrication appliedto make miniature process facilities for rapid DNA analysis to allow genome analysis in aphysician's office. 15.2. TISSUE ENGINEERING 15.2.1. What Is Tissue Engineering?Tissue engineering has a primary focus on developing in vitro bioartificial tissues, typi- cally based on cells derived from donor tissue. These tissues can be used as transplants toimprove biological function in the recipient. Commercial examples include living skin15 Medical Applications of Bioprocess Engineeringch15 10/11/01 6:34 PM Page 463tissue and chondrocytes implanted a damaged knee for production of hyaline-like carti- lage. An extracorporeal (outside of the body) artificial liver employing pig liver cells in ahollow fiber reactor is being clinically tested. Artificial tissues/organs for transplantation that are under active development in- clude liver, pancreas, kidney, fat (for reconstructive surgery), blood vessel, bone marrow,bone, and neurotransmitter-secreting cell constructs. An alternative form of tissue engi-neering is in vivo alteration of cell growth and function. An example would be the use of implanted polymeric tubes with a controlled surface chemistry to encourage and guide re-connection of damaged nerves. Another use of artificial tissue constructs is for toxicologi-cal and pharmacological testing of potential new drugs. In this case the artificial tissue orcombination of tissues acts as a surrogate, reducing the need to use animals for suchtesting. The primary difference between tissue engineering and protein production from mammalian cells lies in the constraints on cell selection. For protein production we prefercontinuous, transformed cell lines. A single cell type is desirable. For tissue engineeringthe goal is to replicate the response of a living tissue. Cells removed from a tissue and cul-tured as a homogeneous cell type in two dimensions (e.g., on a solid surface) often losetheir authentic in vivo response. Since cell transformation and cancer are closely related, transformed cells cannot be used for a product for transplantation. Reconstruction of arti-ficial tissues requires a deep understanding of the interactions of one cell with another,control of cellular differentiation processes, and knowledge of how cells interact with sur-faces to which they attach. Most often a polymer scaffold is used to guide and organizetissue growth. Maintaining the correct ratio of cell types can be difficult, since some celltypes, such as fibroblasts, can \"outgrow\" others. The appropriate cell types must organizethemselves into the appropriate three-dimensional configuration. With such tissues, func-tion requires appropriate structure. Ideally the cells can be multiplied from donor tissuefor at least 10 passages and then assume the fully differentiated phenotype when thecorrect stimulus is applied. A major challenge is the routine, reproducible culture ofsuch cells, and bioprocess engineers are in an excellent position to contribute to this technology. Of particular importance to many tissue-engineered constructs is the formation of extracellular matrix, the interaction of cells with one another, and the interaction with anartificial surface. Anchorage-dependent cells must attach and spread on a substrate surfaceto proliferate and function. Cell adhesion is mediated by extracellular matrix proteinssuch as fibronectin and collagen. Synthetic substrates can be modified by adding syntheticpeptide sequences (3 to 6 amino acids) to a surface at the end of a synthetic polymer. Thedifference in strength of cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesion can greatly alter the three-dimensional organization of the cells. The use of simulated microgravity reactors coupled with polymer scaffolds has been useful in some cases in the development of certain tissue constructs. The use of mi-crofabrication techniques, where the investigator has control over placement of individualcells, is an intriguing technology for more authentic tissue constructs. An increasinglylarge array of tools are being developed for controlling the formation of tissue constructswith improved performance. Development of effective tissue constructs that are biologically complex, such as the liver, is a very difficult problem, and commercial production of transplantable organs 464 Medical Applications of Bioprocess Engineering Chap. 15ch15 10/11/01 6:34 PM Page 464is in the distant future. However, commercial production of simple tissues has been ac- complished. 15.2.2. Commercial Tissue Culture Processes The two examples of commercial production of tissue-engineered products are for skin and cartilage. 15.2.2.1. Tissue-Engineered Skin Replacements. Skin replacements are needed for patients with burns, with pressure ulcers (usually due to diabetes), and with re-constructive surgery. Cadaver skin is undesirable because of potential disease trans-mission, possible immunological rejection, inflammation of the wound bed, limitedavailability, and high cost due to labor-intensive procurement. Animal products would beproblematic due to immunological reactions. An \"artificial\" human skin replacement thatcan be taken out of the freezer and used by physicians is highly desirable. TransCyte, ahuman fibroblast-derived temporary skin substitute, is such a product. An artificial human skin is made from human neonatal foreskin fibroblasts which are obtained from routine circumcision discards. These fibroblast cells are easily availableand not subject to rejection by the body; they are also capable of replication, and numberscan be expanded in a straightforward manner. Donor tissue is enzymatically digested andseeded onto a three-dimensional bioresorbable polymer scaffold. The scaffoldis placed in a bioreactor that provides a physiologically similar environment to promotecell growth and secretion of proteins and extracellular matrix material. The cells and ex-tracellular matrix material result in a three-dimensional tissue construct with metaboli-cally active cells that is functionally similar to natural skin and promotes wound healing. The manufacturing process is centered on a bioreactor system that mimics in vivo conditions through control of temperature, pH, oxygen level, nutrient supply, waste re-moval, and fluid hydrodynamics. It must produce thousands of individual products of uni-form and reproducible quality. The manufacturing system requires a bioreactor forproduct growth that also serves as final packaging. The system is sealed after assemblyand remains sealed to maintain sterility. Figure 15.1 is a schematic of the process. Thebioreactor is made of plastic with inlet and outlet ports. It is flat and just large enough tohold a polymer mesh about 13 by 19 cm. Twelve individual bioreactors are manifolded to-gether. Groups of twelve are then operated in parallel to provide the desired lot size. Oncethe system is sterilized, it is opened only for cell seeding and nutrient replenishment.About three weeks are required for growth. At the end of this growth period, cryopreserv-ative is pumped into the bioreactor module. After sealing inlet and outlet tubes, the biore-actor is packaged, frozen, and then stored or shipped. The product is thawed and used bythe physician. This manufacturing process is similar to many we have discussed before, but differs in that the product is discrete and not in solution.

Articulate or hyaline cartilage is a thin layer of tissue found at the ends of bones. Damage to articulatecartilage in the knee is a common health problem. Cartilage consists of three primary Sec. 15.2 Tissue Engineering 465ch15 10/11/01 6:34 PM Page 465components: collagen fibrils, proteoglycans, and cells known as chondrocytes. These cells are present in low numbers (1 %by volume) but are responsible for synthesis and release of these other compounds, forming cartilage. When chondrocytes are cultured as two-dimensional (monolayer) cultures, the cells are no longer differentiated and do not makenormal hyaline matrix proteins. However, if cultured in three dimensions, such as a sus-pension in agarose, or in vivo, the cells redifferentiate and begin to manufacture hyaline- like matrix. Because of immunological responses it is advantageous for patients to supply their own cells for expansion in number before being reinjected into the knee. A manufacturingprocess for individual cell growth is needed. The supply and reuse of cells from an indi-vidual is termed autologous implantation . The basic procedure entails biopsy of a patient to obtain a small number of chondro- cytes, monolayer culture of primary chondrocytes and expansion of cell numbers, releaseof cells from monolayer and into suspension, assembly of cells in three dimensions, andinjection into the patient's own knee. This product is known as Carticel. The implantedcells produce hyalinelike cartilage and fill in defects in the patient's knee. Patients canoften reenter vigorous physical activity in twelve months. The primary manufacturing challenge here is the need for separate culture for each individual. To accomplish this for mass production is a challenge to any manufacturingprocess. There is expected to be a demand for other therapies (e.g., cancer treatment),where cells from an individual will need to be efficiently cultured and returned to theindividual. 466 Medical Applications of Bioprocess Engineering Chap. 15 Figure 15.1.

GENE THERAPY USING VIRAL VECTORS Gene therapy is the transfer of one or more genes into cells for a therapeutic effect. It can be done ex vivo (outside the body) in tissues that are transplanted back into the patient or in vivo, where the genes, usually in a delivery vehicle such as a virus, are injected into the patient. Gene therapy is intellectually connected to metabolic engineering. However, the complexity of humans presents an even greater challenge than the metabolic engineeringof a single cell. Gene therapy is a quantitative problem that makes good use of the quanti-tative skills of engineers. Basically the right gene needs to be delivered to only the righttissue target in the right amount, with the gene products being expressed at the right levelat the right time for the right length of time. For gene therapy to be effective many thingshave to go right. Clinical success with gene therapy has been minimal, as approaches havebeen qualitative and trial-and-error in nature. A rational analysis would be a useful tool. Many methods can be used for gene delivery. These involve viral vectors, use of naked DNA, and liposome or particle-mediated gene delivery. In this chapter we willfocus only on viral systems. Bioprocess technology is necessary for production of theviral vectors, and analyses arising from bioprocess studies are applicable to gene therapy. 15.3.1. Models of Viral Infection The three primary virus vectors for gene therapy are retroviruses (derived from a wild- type virus that infects mice), adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses. Retroviruses areenveloped viruses, because they are encapsulated in a lipid bilayer membrane. The adeno-virus and adeno-associated viruses are nonenveloped viruses. The model of viral traffick-ing that we discuss below is for enveloped viruses. Dee et al. proposed a model for the viral trafficking of Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an enveloped RNA virus that has been considered as a vector for large-scale production ofheterologous proteins. However, this analysis, which was motivated by a bioprocess appli-cation, is applicable to retrovirus vectors for gene therapy. As indicated in Fig. 15.2, enveloped RNA viruses can enter cells through receptor- mediated endocytosis. The virus binds to specific receptor molecules on the cell's surface.It is assumed (for this analysis) that attachment is irreversible and that the number of re-ceptor molecules is much greater than the number of virus particles present. Under thiscircumstance: (15.1) where V exis the number of extracellular viruses per cell, Cis the cell concentration, and ka is the attachment-rate constant. The value of kacan be estimated as: (15.2) where kfis the intrinsic forward rate constant for the binding of a single viral attachment protein to a receptor, ais the number of viral attachment proteins per virus, and Ris thekkRa f =()adV dt k CVex a ex/ =- Sec. 15.3 Gene Therapy Using Viral Vectors 467K.

If the ratio of Rto Vexis large, Ris approximately the total number of receptors. Once the virus is attached, it randomly associates with \"coated pits,\" which internal- ize the virus through the process of endocytosis . Endocytosis is a process of invagination of the plasma membrane to form a vesicle in which the receptors and anything attached tothe receptors are captured within the vesicle. Such vesicles are known as endosomes . The rate of endocytosis is assumed to be: (15.3) where V iis the number per cell of internalized virus, Vsis the surface concentration of virus (number per cell), and keis the endocytosis rate constant. The amount of surface virus can be determined from combining eqs. 15.1 and 15.3 to give: (15.4) Endosomes are intermediates in recycle of plasma membrane components and trans- port of internalized materials to lysosomes for degradation. For the virus to replicate suc-cessfully it must escape from the endosome before it is delivered to a lysosome. Endosomesundergo a biphasic pH change. In early endosomes pH drops from about 7.5 to 6.0 within 5to 10 min. In the second phase pH drops slowly to about 5.2 in another 30 to 60 min. The pHdrop is due to membrane proteins that pump hydrogen ions into the endosome.dV dt k CV k Vsa e x e s/ =-dV dt k Vie s/ = 468 Medical Applications of Bioprocess Engineering Chap. 15 Figure 15.2. The trafficking of an enveloped RNA virus is depicted. A mathematical model of these processes is given in the text.ch15 10/11/01 6:34 PM Page 468The virus escapes through fusion of its membrane envelope with the endosome membrane. The fusion process is pH dependent. For SFV the threshold pH for fusion is6.2. This threshold is reached in early endosomes. The fusion process is quite rapid. How-ever, not all virus undergoes fusion. The virus balance in the endosome is: (15.5) where V eneis the number of virus in the early endosomes, kfusis the observed fusion-rate constant, his the fraction of virus that can successfully fuse with endosomal membrane, and ktranis the rate constant for movement of inactive virus to the lysosome and degrada- tion. The main cause of inactive virus is the fusion of virus with membrane fragmentswithin the endosome instead of the endosomal membrane. Virus that successfully fuses with the endosomal membrane is released into the cy- tosol. The protein coat is removed rapidly, and for this analysis we assume that effectivelyall cytoplasmic virus is uncoated, so that the RNA is released and can be replicated. The rate equation for uncoating is (15.6) where V cytis the cytoplasmic virus. The amount of RNA synthesized per cell follows a saturation type response, so that: (15.7) where kmand Ksvare parameters dependent on the host cell.

These same equations can easily be applied to an ex vivo system for gene therapy. For in vivo use they apply in principle, but the presence of various natural compounds in the bloodstream can alter k a(and potentially other parameters), and multiple cell types are present which may bind, but not endocytose virus. A pharmacokinetic model (to predicttime-dependent virus distribution at different positions in the body) would need to be cou-pled with virus/cell interaction models (of the type developed here) for each major celltype. The reader can easily see why ex vivo therapy would be much easier to design than an in vivo protocol. For either the ex vivo or in vivo therapies to be successful, there must be a method to efficiently produce virus. 15.3.2. Mass Production of Retrovirus The efficient production of a highly concentrated solution of retroviruses that have been ge- netically modified to deliver a gene is difficult. Genetically engineered retroviruses, like allrecombinant viruses, are produced by a two-part system consisting of a packaging cell lineand the recombinant vector. This two-part system is necessary because the recombinant virusis unable to replicate itself. The recombinant virus is derived from a wild-type virus in whichessential viral genes have been deleted and replaced with the therapeutic gene of interest.The enzyme reverse transcriptase converts RNA-encoded genes into DNA, which is trans-ported into the nucleus and integrated into the cell's chromosomal DNA. The packaging cell line is genetically engineered to produce the essential, structural viral genes that have been deleted from the viral genome. Because the viral genes are en-coded in the packaging cell's chromosome, the resulting viral particles are incapable ofcausing disease, but act as carriers for the desired, therapeutic genes. The resulting retro-virus vector can be used only with dividing cells, since cells must undergo mitosis beforegene integration can occur. This feature limits in vivo use to cases such as cancer suppres- sion but is not a limitation on ex vivo systems. Another limitation on the retrovirus system is a bioprocess limitation; the produc- tion of high-titer virus and subsequent purification and concentration without loss of in-fectivity have been difficult. A major limitation to the effectiveness of many gene-therapyapproaches, including the use of retroviruses, is that the average number of genes deliv-ered to target cells is too low to achieve a beneficial therapeutic effect. This low efficiencyis due to the bioprocess limitation on production of a concentrated, highly infectiousretrovirus preparation.Vkk k C V kk C k k k C k Cekke kk k kekkecytfus e a exo ea fus tran akC 10/11/01 6:34 PM Page 470The problems in producing a highly infectious preparation derive from two factors: rapid decay of virus and inhibition of viral infectivity by proteoglycans released by the packaging cell line. The proteoglycans have very high molecular weight. If the virus isconcentrated by ultrafiltration, the proteoglycan is also concentrated by nearly the samefactor. While the high virus concentration would be expected to increase the number of in-fected cells, the presence of concentrated proteoglycan leads to increased inhibition of in-fection, so that the number of cells infected does not increase significantly and in somecases even decreases with the concentrated viral preparation. Another approach to increase viral titer is to produce virus at a reduced temperature (e.g., 28\u00b0C versus 37\u00b0C). While both the rate of virus production and viral decay decreasewith temperature, the rate of decay is more sensitive to temperature. Thus the amount ofpotentially active virus is severalfold higher when produced at 28\u00b0C (e.g., 2 \u00a510 5cfu/ml vs. 6 \u00a5104cfu/ml; cfu is colony-forming units and measures the number of active viruses in a dilute solution). However, the transduction efficiency did not increase, presumablydue to changes in proteoglycan concentration. These results should inspire the reader to consider bioreactor options beyond batch growth followed by ultrafiltration. Clearly, the reader would want to consider a bioreactorconfiguration in which the virus is removed as soon as it is produced and then purified andstored at low temperature to reduce decay. Further, a method of concentration of virusneeds to be developed that does not also concentrate proteoglycan. Enzymatic digestion ofproteoglycans has been suggested, but due to multiplicity of proteoglycan structures sucha strategy is difficult to implement. Selective adsorption and desorption of virus is attrac-tive, but the sensitivity of the virus to these processes is a concern. A packaging cell al-tered in its capability to produce proteoglycan is another possible strategy. The primary point is that bioprocess technology is intimately connected to produc- tion of agents that can be effective in gene therapy. The solution to the biomedical prob-lem requires a solution to the bioprocess problem. 15.4. BIOREACTORS Mass production of cells for transplantation or the use of bioreactors as artificial hybrid organs are subjects of intense development in medicine. These are issues in which bio-process engineers may make significant contributions. 15.4.1. Stem Cells and HematopoiesisSome animal cells are capable of extensive replication and self-renewal. Others are highly differentiated and perform specific functions; typically differentiated cells cannot repli-cate (at least, replication is very limited). A stem cell is an undifferentiated cell capable of continuous self-renewal that can also produce large numbers of differentiated progeny, de-pending on extracellular factors. The best studied system is the hematopoietic system.There are eight major types of fully mature blood cells in the human circulatory system. Ahematopoietic stem cell gives rise to two types of progenitor cells . The progenitor cells Sec. 15.4 Bioreactors 471 J. M. LeDoux, H. E. Davis, J. R. Morgan, and M. L. Yarmush, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 63 capable of self-replication but have a more restricted range of cells into which they may differentiate. In the hematopoietic system one type of progenitor cell can give rise tothe myeloid cells (e.g., red blood cells or erythrocytes, platelets, macrophages, etc.) andthe other to lymphoid cells (e.g., T-cells and B-cells). The progression of differentiationdepends on a large number of hematopoietic growth factors. Hematopoiesis, the processof generating these blood cells, takes place in the bone marrow. Ex vivo hematopoiesis is an alternative or supplement to bone marrow transplants. Hematopoietic stem and progen-itor cells can be recovered from human blood, particularly umbilical cord blood. There are many challenges to generating commercial-scale systems for hemato- poiesis. Coculture with stroma cells from the bone marrow is necessary to generate neces-sary growth factors, so bioreactors must accommodate adherent cell growth. Three basicreactor types are under development. Fluidized bed reactors with macroporous supportsmimic structures much like that in bone. However, there are challenges in controlling sur-face chemistry and maintaining the appropriate mix of cell types. Cell sampling and con-trol of reactor conditions can be problematic. Flatbed reactors (e.g., modified T-flasks with continuous flow possible) can carry stroma and facilitate analysis and design, since the geometry is well defined. Direct mi-croscopic observation of cells is possible. Automated flatbed systems have been used togenerate cells for human clinical trials. Membrane-based units, such as hollow-fiber reactors, are potential solutions. This is an efficient design that is fairly easy to characterize. However, cell observation and har-vesting are considered problematic. Another alternative is the possible use of spheroidcultures (a natural aggregation of a mixed population of cells), which can be done insuspension-type bioreactors. Bioreactors for production of other tissue types from other stem cells are a real pos- sibility. There is far less experience with bioreactors for other stem cells/tissues, but theprinciples the reader has learned in this book should be applicable to these challenges. 15.4.2. Extracorporeal Artificial Liver Liver failure is a major medical problem. The liver performs many metabolic functions (carbohydrate, fat, and vitamin metabolism, production of plasma proteins, conjugation ofbile acids, and detoxification), of which detoxification is the most critical. In some cases,a failing liver may recover if the metabolic and detoxification demands on it can be re-duced; an artificial liver may provide the respite necessary for self-repair of a liver. Inother cases an artificial liver may serve as a bridge to a transplant. Due to the spatial and metabolic complexity of the liver, an implantable artificial liver is a distant objective. However, an extracorporeal device to serve as temporary assistdevice is realistic (such a system is in clinical trials). A promising design is a hollow-fibersystem using porcine (pig) hepatocytes. Such cells are relatively easy to obtain in largequantities and maintain a satisfactory level of differentiated cellular activity in regard todetoxification. A disadvantage is due to limited lifespan (and proliferative ability). Themembrane that separates these cells from the blood provides protection against adverseimmune reactions. The issues in the design of such hollow-fiber reactors are similar,whether the reactor is to be used in a bioprocess operation or in a biomedical application. 472 Medical Applications of Bioprocess Engineering Chap. 15ch15 10/11/01 6:34 PM Page 47215.5. SUMMARY The principles from bioprocess engineering are NOT restricted to use for biomanufacture of chemicals, medicinals, or other biological compounds. These same principles havemany applications in medicine. Indeed, as biomedical engineering has become more ori-ented to molecular and cellular systems and bioprocess engineering more toward animalcells, the boundary between these two activities has become very porous. Important concepts in this chapter include ideas of how to produce tissue constructs on a commercial scale. Also the efficient production of virus for use in gene therapy is anunresolved bioprocess problem. The basic understanding of the dynamics of viral infec-tion of cells is important both in design of biomanufacturing processes and for gene ther-apy. Quantitative approaches to describing such processes can lead to rational design bothfor the biomanufacturing process and for therapeutic strategies. Bioreactor design is alsoan important component of design of artificial organs and reactors to generate functionaltissue from stem cells. The list of examples of the intersection of bioprocessing and medicine is a growing one that will present many readers of this text with exciting career possibilities.

INTRODUCTION The dynamics of mixed cultures are important considerations in some commercial fer- mentations. They are critical to understanding the response of many ecological systems tostress. The use of organisms with recombinant DNA has added another dimension to ourconsideration of how cells within a population interact with each other. Many food fermentations, such as cheese manufacture, depend on multiple interact- ing species. The biological treatment of waste waters relies on an undefined complex mix-ture of microorganisms. The ratio of various species in the treatment process is critical;sudden shifts in the composition of the population can lead to failure of the unit to meetits objectives. In all natural environments, cells exist in potentially mixed populations. Under- standing how these cells interact with one another is critical to understanding the naturalcycles for the elements (e.g., C, N, and S), the response of ecosystems to environmentalchallenges (for example, acid rain), and the rate and extent of degradation of chemicals in-troduced into such ecosystems. As discussed in Chapter 14, many populations with recombinant DNA behave as mixed-culture systems. Some members of the population will lose or modify the insertedgene (often carried on a plasmid). Although a single species is present, the formation ofmutant or plasmidless cells leads to a distinct subpopulation. The interaction of the16 Mixed Culturesch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 475subpopulation with the original population follows the principles we will develop in this chapter for mixed populations. 16.2. MAJOR CLASSES OF INTERACTIONS IN MIXED CULTURES The major interactions between two organisms in a mixed culture are competition, neu- tralism, mutualism, commensalism, amensalism, and 476 Mixed Cultures Chap. 16TABLE 16.1 Scheme of Classification of Binary Population Interactions.

In competition, each population competes for the same substrate. Two pop-ulations or microorganisms with similar nutrient requirements usually compete for anumber of common, required nutrients when grown together. The outcome of competition between two species for the same growth-limiting sub- strate in an open system (e.g., a chemostat) is determined by the specific growth-rate- limiting substrate concentration relationship. Two different cases can be distinguished in amixed culture of two competing species (Fig. 16.1): 1. m ais always greater than mb. The organisms with the fastest growth rate will dis- place the others from the culture. This is known as the exclusion principle. 2.Crossover in m-Srelationship. In this case, the faster-growing organism is deter- mined by the dilution rate. Depending on the dilution rate, three different cases maybe identified: a.At the crossover point D =m x; S=Sx, two species could be maintained in a chemostat at D =mx. However, this is an unstable operating point. b.If D >mx, then ma>mb, and Bwill and Awill be washed out; Bwill dominate. In a batch system, both species would exist in culture media. The ratio of number density of species at a given time will be determined by the relative magnitudes of thespecific growth rates and the initial concentrations of cells. Neutralism is an interaction where neither population is affected by the presence of the other. That is, there is no change in the growth rate of either organism due to the pres-ence of the other. Neutralism is relatively rare. One example of neutralism is the growth ofyogurt starter strains of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus in a chemostat. The total counts of these two species at a dilution rate of 0.4 h -1are quite similar whether the populations are cultured separately or together. Neutralism may occur in special environments whereeach species consumes different limiting substrates and neither species is affected by theend products of the other. Mutualism and protocooperation are more common than neutralism and may in- volve different mechanisms. In both cases, the presence of each population has a positiveeffect on the other. For mutualism, the interaction is essential to the survival of bothspecies. In protocooperation, the interaction is nonessential. One mechanism is the mutualexchange of required substances or the removal of toxic end products by each organism.

Case (a) corresponds to mmA >mmBand KSA \u00a3KSB,while case (b) corresponds to a case where mmA >mmB,but KSB <KSA. In case (b), the growth curves cross and Aand B could potentially coexist at D =mxand S=Sxin a chemostat.ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 477The metabolisms of partner populations must be complementary to yield a mutualistic in- teraction. An example is the growth of a phenylalanine-requiring strain of Lactobacillus and a folic-acid-requiring strain of Streptococcus in a mixed culture. Exchange of the growth factors phenylalanine and folic acid produced by partner organisms helps each or-ganism to grow in a mixed culture, while separate pure cultures exhibit no growth.Another example of mutualistic interaction exists between aerobic bacteria and photosyn-thetic algae. Bacteria use oxygen and carbohydrate for growth and produce CO 2and H2O. The algae convert CO2to carbohydrates and liberate oxygen in the presence of sunlight. The reader should note that symbiosis and mutualism are not the same. Symbiosis implies a relationship when two organisms live together. A symbiotic relationship may bemutualistic, but it may also be neutralistic, parasitic, commensalistic, and so on. Commensalism is an interaction in which one population is positively affected by the presence of the other. However, the second population is not affected by the presenceof the first population. Various mechanisms may yield a commensal interaction. Two com-mon mechanisms are the following: 1.The second population produces a required nutrient or growth factor for the firstpopulation. 2.The second population removes a substance from the medium that is toxic to thefirst population. An example of the first type of commensal interaction is the production of H 2S by Desulfovibrio (through the reduction of SO2 4), which is used as an energy source by sulfur bacteria. 478 Mixed Cultures Chap. 16 An example of the second type of commensal interaction is the removal of lactic acid by the fungus Geotrichium candidum, which allows the growth of Streptococcus lactis. This interaction is utilized in cheese making using S. lactis. Lactic acid produced by S. lactis inhibits the growth of the bacteria. The fungus metabolizes lactic acid and im- proves the growth conditions for S. lactis. Amensalism is the opposite of commensalism. In amensalism, population Ais nega- tively affected by the presence of the other population ( B). However, population Bis not affected by the presence of population A.Various amensal interaction mechanisms are possible. Two common mechanisms are the following: 1.Population Bproduces a toxic substance that inhibits the growth of population A. 2.Population Bremoves essential nutrients from the media, thus negatively affecting the growth of population A.ch16.cou 10/17/01 3:29 PM Page 478One example of the first type of amensal interaction is the production of antibiotics by certain molds to inhibit the growth of others. Some microbes excrete enzymes that de-compose cell-wall polymers. Such organisms destroy their competitors and also utilize thenutrients released by the lysed cells. The microbial synthesis of organic acids reduces pHand inhibits the growth of other organisms. Predation and parasitism are interactions in which one population benefits at the expense of the other. These two interactions are distinguished by the relative size oforganisms and the mechanisms involved. Predation involves the ingestion of prey by thepredator organism. A good example of prey-predator interaction is the ingestion of bacte-ria by protozoa. This interaction is common in aerobic waste-treatment reactors such asactivated sludge units. In parasitism, the host, which is usually the larger organism, isdamaged by the parasite. The parasite benefits from utilization of nutrients from the host.A common example of parasitism is the destruction of microorganisms by microphages.Although the physical mechanisms in predation and parasitism differ, these two phenom-ena have many common features in their conceptual and mathematical descriptions. In an open system, such as a chemostat where predator-prey interactions take place, the populations of predator and prey do not necessarily reach steady state but can oscillateat certain dilution rates. At the beginning of the operation prey concentration is high, butpredator concentration is low. As the predators consume prey, the number of predators in-creases and the prey concentration decreases. After a while, a small prey population can-not support the large predator population, and the predator population decreases whileprey population increases. Depending on the dilution rate and feed substrate concentra-tion, these oscillations may be sustained or damped or may not exist. Finally, note that these interactions can, and often do, exist in combination. For ex- ample, Aand Bmay compete for glucose as a nutrient, but Arequires a growth factor from Bto grow. In such a case, both competition and commensalism would be present. 16.3. SIMPLE MODELS DESCRIBING MIXED-CULTURE INTERACTIONS Multiple interacting species can give rise to very complex behavior. In some cases, coex- istence of species is prohibited; in others, complex sustained oscillatory behavior may beobserved. Multiple steady states are possible. Writing the appropriate equations to describe mixed populations follows the princi- ples we discussed in Chapter 6. In each case, a balance must be written for each species(organism, rate-limiting substrate, or product), and these balances will be the same as wehave used previously. Although we may write chemically structured models for each or-ganism, we will confine our discussions to the use of unstructured models for eachspecies. Even so, the population model is still structured in the sense that the whole bio-mass is divided into distinct subpopulations. These equations are often applied to chemostats that mimic many ecosystems. When these equations are solved, they often yield multiple steady states. For each steadystate we need to analyze its stability. An unstable steady state will never be realized inpractice; using phase-plane portraits, we can explore the approach to the steady state and Sec. 16.3 Simple Models Describing Mixed-Culture Interactions 479ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 479the determination of the presence or absence of limit cycles. It is often easier to test a steady state for its local stability (linearized stability analysis) than for its global stability. With this background, we will consider some representative examples. Example 16.1. Competition of two species for the same growth-rate-limiting substrate is common. Deter- mine when the two organisms may stably coexist if both Aand Bfollow Monod kinetics. Solution For this situation, the following equations describe the dynamic situation: (16.1) (16.2) (16.3) If both Aand Bcoexist, we would require from eqs. 16.1 and 16.2 that (16.4) Equation 16.4 can be solved to yield (16.5) Equation 16.5 is meaningful only if S0. Consider the two cases in Fig. 16.1. In case (a), mmAKSB >mmBKSAand mmA > mmB; consequently, Sis always less than zero, and coexistence is impossible. In case (b), however, a value of Scan be found from eq. 16.5 that will allow the populations to coexist. The corresponding Dfor the crossover point is Dc. Although this coexistence is mathematically obtainable, it is not physically attain- able in real systems. In real systems, the dilution rate will vary slightly with time, and, infact, the variation will show a bias. Using an analysis more sophisticated than appropriatefor this text, it can be demonstrated that one competitor will be excluded from the chemo-stat if the intensity of the \"noise\" (random fluctuations) in Dand the bias of the mean of Daway from D care not both zero. Also, it is possible for either competitor to be excluded, depending on how Dvaries. Two competitors can coexist if we modify the conditions of the experiments. Exam- ples of such modifications include allowing spatial heterogeneity (the system is no longerwell mixed or wall growth is present) or another level of interaction is added (e.g., addinga predator or interchange of metabolites). Also, operation of the chemostat in a dynamicmode ( Dis a function of time) can sometimes lead to coexistence. It is also interesting to note that the use of other rate expressions (e.g., substrate inhibition) can lead to multiplecrossover points and potentially multiple steady (1979).ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 480Example 16.2. Consider a case of mutualistic growth in a chemostat. How would you write the appropriate equations for this system? Determine the effects of the addition of competition to mutualism.Solution The physical model is for Aand Bas two separate species. Aproduces P Aas a by-product of growth and Bproduces PB. Organism Brequires PAto grow, while Arequires PB. The feed to a chemostat contains all essential nutrients except for PAand PB, and Aand B may compete for substrate, S,in the feed. For this case the most general description is (16.6) (16.7) (16.8) (16.9) And if the growth of either Aor Bis limited by S,then we need to consider (16.10) Note that YXB/PAis the biomass yield of Busing PAas substrate, and YPAis the amount of PA made per unit mass of A.Similar definitions apply to YXA/PBand YPB. If we consider the pure mutualistic state, then we ignore eq. 16.10. For a coexistent state to exist, D =mA=mB. It is also clear that the rate of production of PAand PBmust exceed their consumption. Thus (16.11) and (16.12) It then follows that (16.13a) or (16.13b) It is also clear that (16.14) =- + m 16.3 Simple Models Describing Mixed-Culture Interactions 481ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 481Equations 16.13b and 16.14 determine whether eqs. 16.6 to 16.9 allow the potential existence of a purely mutualistic steady state. The stability of such a coexistent state has been examined, where mAand mBwere rep- resented by various growth functions. Using a linear stability analysis, it can be shown thatthis pure mutualistic state results in a saddle point, and the system is unstable for all physi-cally accessible values of D.If, however, the growth-rate-limiting substrate for either Aor B is S,then a stable coexistent state can be found. Example 16.3. Consider the growth of a protozoa (predator) on bacteria (prey) in a chemostat. Write appro- priate equations for this system.Solution Here bacteria constitute a substrate for protozoa. In a chemostat culture, the fol- lowing balances can be written yield coefficients for the growth of prey on substrate and the growth of predator on prey, respectively. This model was used to describe the behavior of Dictyostelium discoideum and E. coli in a chemostat culture and was found to predict experimental results quite well. A variety oftypes of coexistence behavior have been revealed by stability analysis. These include no os-cillations, damped oscillations, and sustained oscillations (see Fig. 16.2). A classical model that describes oscillations in a prey-predator system is the Lotka-V olterra model, in which growth rates are expressed by the following equations: Prey: (16.18) Predator: (16.19) The first term in eq. 16.18 describes the growth of prey on substrate and the second the consumption of prey by predators. The first and second terms in eq. 16.19 describe thedeath of predator in the absence of prey and the growth of predator on prey, respectively.Y p/bis the yield of predators on prey (g/g), m\u00a2bis the specific growth rate of prey on a solu- ble substrate (h-1), m\u00a2pis the growth rate of predator on prey (l/g-h), and k\u00a2dis the specific death rate of the predator (h-1). Equations 16.18 and 16.19 allow a steady-state solution for batch Page 482By defining (16.20) we can express eqs. 16.18 and 16.19 in terms of Xband Xp.

Figure 16.3 describes the limit cycles (oscillatory trajectories) of prey-predator populations for differ-ent initial population levels. The Lotka-V olterra model considers the exponential growth of prey species in the absence of predator and neglects the utilization of substrate by prey species according toMonod form.

MIXED CULTURES IN NATURE Mixed cultures of organisms are common in natural ecological systems. Microorganisms are involved in the natural cycles of most elements (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, andsulfur). Simplified diagrams of the carbon and nitrogen cycles are presented in Figs. 16.4and 16.5. Organisms living in soil and aquatic environments actively participate in carbonand nitrogen cycles. For example, certain organisms fix atmospheric CO 2to form carbo- hydrates, while others degrade carbohydrates and release CO2into the atmosphere. Simi- larly, some organisms fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to form ammonium and proteins, while others convert ammonium into nitrite and nitrate (nitrification), and others reducenitrate into atmospheric nitrogen (denitrification). Sulfur-oxidizing organisms convert re-duced sulfur compounds (sulfur and sulfide) into sulfate, and sulfate-reducing organismsreduce sulfate into hydrogen sulfide. The aforementioned interactions among different species take place in natural systems in a more complicated manner. The complexity of such a system is depicted in Sec. 16.4 Mixed Cultures in Nature 485 Figure 16.4. Simplified diagram of the carbon cycle. Also shown (dashed lines) is the major component of the oxygen cycle, which is closely linked to the cycle of carbon.(With permission, from J. E. Bailey and D. F.

Understanding such complex cycles is important to understanding the capacity of natural ecosystems to degrade organic pollutants. 16.5. INDUSTRIAL UTILIZATION OF MIXED CULTURES Defined mixed microbial populations are commonly used in cheese making, a good exam- ple of using mixed cultures in food production. Cheeses of various types are produced byinoculating pasteurized fresh milk with appropriate lactic acid organisms. The bacteriaused for lactic acid production are various species of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus in a mixed culture. Other organisms are used to develop flavor and aroma. Among these areBrevibacterium linens, Propionibacterium pasteurized milk, a protein-rich curd is precipitated by the acidity of the medium, and the liquid is drained off. The precipitated curd is allowed toage by action of bacteria or mold. Some molds used in cheese making are Penicillum camemberti and Penicillum roqueforti. Lactic acid bacteria are also used in whiskey manufacture. Lactobacillus added to the yeast reduces pH and, therefore, the chance of contamination. Lactobacillus also con- tributes to the flavor and aroma of whiskey. A favorable interaction between yeast and lac-tic acid bacteria exists in ginger-beer fermentation. Sec. 16.5 Industrial Utilization of Mixed Cultures 487 Figure 16.6. Simplified schematic of the cycles of matter in an anaerobic environment. (With permission, from J. E. Bailey and D. F. Ollis, Biochemical Engineering Fundamen- tals, 2d ed., 1986, p. 918.)ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 487The utilization of undefined mixed microbial cultures in waste-treatment processes is typical and unavoidable. Waste-water treatment constitutes one of the largest-scale usesof bioprocesses. Mixed cultures are also utilized in the anaerobic digestion of waste mate-rials. Cellulase producers, acid formers, and methane producers are typical organisms in-volved in the anaerobic digestion of cellulosic wastes. However, attempts to encourage thegrowth of a particular species on waste materials have been made. The Symba process was developed in Sweden for treating starchy wastes, particu- larly those from potato processing. This process utilizes Endomycopsis fibuligera for amylase production and a yeast, Candida utilis, for the utilization of sugar molecules pro- duced from the hydrolysis of starch. Single-cell protein (SCP) is produced simultaneouslywith potato waste treatment. Corn and pea wastes are also treated by a mixed culture of Trichoderma viride and Geotrichium sp. T. viride produces cellulase to break down cellulose into reduced sugar molecules, and Geotrichium produces amylases to break down starch into reduced sugar molecules. Both organisms utilize reduced sugar molecules for growth. A mixed culture of Candida lipolytica and Candida tropicalis has been grown on hydrocarbons, n-paraffins, or gas oil for single-cell protein (SCP) production purposes in both laboratory and pilot-scale operations. The utilization of a mixed culture of yeasts wasproved to yield better product quality as compared to pure yeast strains. Gaseous hydrocarbon substrates like methane can be utilized by certain bacteria to produce SCP. Several experimental studies have shown that mixed cultures of methane-utilizing organisms grow faster than pure cultures. Certain methane-utilizing species of Pseudomonas oxidize methane to methanol. However, Pseudomonas is inhibited by the end product, methanol. Inclusion of a methanol- utilizing bacteria such as Hyphomicrobium into the growth medium eliminates the problem of methanol inhibition. This relationship is mutualistic in the sense that Pseudomonas sup- plies carbon source (CH 3OH) for Hyphomicrobium, removes the growth inhibitor (methanol) of Pseudomonas. (16.25) 16.6. BIOLOGICAL WASTE TREATMENT: AN EXAMPLE OF THE INDUSTRIAL UTILIZATION OF MIXED CULTURES 16.6.1. OverviewWaste materials generated in a society can be classified in three major categories: 1.Industrial wastes are produced by various industries, and waste characteristics vary greatly from one industry to another. Industrial wastes usually contain hydro-carbons, carbohydrates, alcohols, lipids, and aromatic organics. Industrial wastesare rich in carbon compounds and usually deficient in nitrogen (high C/N ratio);CH CH OH CO 6:41 PM Page 488therefore, the biological treatment of industrial wastes usually requires supplemen- tal addition of nitrogen compounds and other nutrients. The presence of potentiallytoxic compounds must be carefully considered in devising a treatment strategy. 2.Domestic wastes are treated by municipalities and derive from humans and their daily activities. They include ground garbage, laundry water, excrement, and oftensome industrial wastes that have been sewered into the municipal system. Domesticwaste varies significantly with time in terms of flow and composition due to the pe-riodic nature of human activity (e.g., flow decreases at night when most peoplesleep). 3.Agricultural wastes are produced by farm animals (e.g., manure) and include waste plants, such as straws. Agricultural wastes are usually carbon rich because of highcellulosic material content, although some wastes, such as poultry manure, are highin nitrogen. Each of these waste materials has its own characteristics, and treatment methods vary de- pending on these characteristics. Three major waste treatment methods are the following: 1.Physical treatment includes screening, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and flotation, which are usually used for the removal of insoluble materials. 2.Chemical treatment includes chemical oxidations (chlorination, ozonation) CaCl 2, FeCl3, or Al2(SO4)3. 3.Biological treatment includes the aerobic and anaerobic treatment of waste water by a mixed culture of microorganisms. Certain characteristics of waste water need to be known before treatment. Among them are (1) physical characteristics, such as color, odor, pH, temperature, and solids con-tents (suspended and dissolved solids), and (2) chemical characteristics, such as organicand inorganic compounds. Major carbon compounds in a typical industrial waste are car-bohydrates, lipids-oils, hydrocarbons, and proteins. Other compounds, such as phenols,surfactants, herbicides, pesticides, and aromatic compounds, are usually in relativelysmall concentrations ( <1 g/l) but are difficult to degrade by biological means. Among in- organic compounds present in waste water are nitrogenous compounds (NH + 4, NO- 3), sul- fur compounds 4 H2S, NH3, and CH4. The carbon content (strength) of a waste-water sample can be expressed in several ways: biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total or- ganic carbon (TOC). Normally, a 5-day BOD value is reported. The BOD5is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) consumed when a waste-water sample is seeded with activebacteria and incubated at 20 C for 5 days. Since the amount of oxygen consumed is stoi- chiometrically related primarily to the organic content of waste water, BOD is a measureof the strength of waste water. This stoichiometric coefficient is not always known, sincethe composition of the organics is usually unknown. Also, some nitrogen-containing orinorganic compounds will exert an oxygen demand. If the only organic compound is Sec. 16.6 Biological Waste Treatment: An Example of Industrial Utilization 489ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 489glucose, oxygen consumption can be easily related to the carbon content of waste water under aerobic conditions. (16.26) According to the stoichiometry of this reaction 1.07 g of oxygen is required for the oxida- tion of 1 g of glucose. Samples of waste water need to be properly diluted to obtain an accurate BOD5 measurement, seeded with active bacteria, and incubated at 20 C for 5 days along with an unseeded blank. BOD5is calculated using the following equation: (16.27) BOD measurements have some shortcomings. This method is applicable only to bio- degradable, soluble organics and requires a high concentration of active bacteria pre-adapted to this type of waste. Moreover, if organic compounds are refractory, 5 days ofincubation may not suffice, and 20 days of incubation (BOD 20) may be required. COD is a measure of the concentration of chemically oxidizable organic com- pounds present in waste water. Organic compounds are oxidized by a strong chemical oxi-dant, and using the reaction stoichiometry, the organic content is calculated. Almost allorganic compounds present in waste water are oxidized by certain strong chemical oxi-dants. Therefore, the COD content of a waste-water sample usually exceeds the measuredBOD (COD >BOD 5). A typical chemical oxidation reaction (unbalanced) is (16.28) Dichromate may be used as an oxidizing agent, and by a redox balance, the amount of oxygen required to oxidize organic compounds can be calculated. This method is faster(order of 3 hours), easier, and less expensive than BOD measurements. The TOC content of waste-water samples can be determined by using a TOC ana- lyzer. After proper dilutions, samples are injected into a high-temperature (900\u00b0 to 950\u00b0F)furnace and all organic carbon compounds are oxidized to CO 2, which is measured by an infrared analyzer. To determine the TOC content, waste-water samples should be acidifiedto remove inorganic carbon compounds (mainly carbonates). The total carbon content ofwaste water can be determined before and after acidification, and the difference is inor-ganic carbon content. The nitrogen content of waste-water samples is usually measured by total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) determination. Other key nutrient concentrations, such as phosphate, sul-fur, and toxic compounds, should be determined before waste streams are treated. The concentration of biomass in a waste treatment system using suspended cells is measured as mixed-liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS). Basically waste water ofknown volume is filtered and the collected solids dried and weighed to give mixed-liquorsuspended solids (MLSS). This material is then \"volatilized\" by burning in air at 600\u00b0C.The weight of the remaining noncombustible, inorganic material is the \"fixed\" solids. Thedifference between the original mass prior to combustion and the fixed solids is the\"volatile\" portion. The volatile portion or MLVSS is assumed to be primarily microbes,although carbonaceous particles are included in the measurement.CHO C rO H C r C O HO272 22 abc ++ \u00e6 = = = [( ( ] [( ( ]t t t t 0 5 0 5CH O O C O HO61 2 2 2 2 666 6+\u00c6 + 490 Mixed Cultures Chap. 16ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 490A typical waste-treatment operation employing biological treatment includes the following steps: 1.Primary treatment includes the removal of coarse solids and suspended matter (screening, sedimentation, filtration) and conditioning of the waste-water stream bypH adjustment and nutrient additions (e.g., PO 3- 4 , NH+ 4). 2.Secondary treatment is the major step in biological treatment; it includes biological oxidation or anaerobic treatment of soluble and insoluble organic compounds. Or-ganic compounds are oxidized to CO 2and H2O by organisms under aerobic condi- tions. Unoxidized organic compounds and solids from aerobic treatment (e.g., cellwall material, lipids-fats) are decomposed to a mixture of CH 4, CO2, and H2S under anaerobic conditions. A sludge of undecomposed material must be purged from ei- ther system. 3.Tertiary treatment includes the removal of the remaining inorganic compounds (phosphate, sulfate, ammonium) and other refractory organic compounds by one ormore physical separation methods, such as carbon adsorption, deep-bed filtration,and in some cases membrane-based techniques, such as reverse osmosis or electro-dialysis. 16.6.2. Biological Waste T reatment Processes Biological waste-water treatment usually employs a mixed culture of organisms whose makeup varies with the nature of the waste. Biological treatment may be aerobic or anaer-obic. The major aerobic processes (or reactor types) used in waste-water treatment are (1) activated sludge, (2) trickling filter, (3) rotating biological contractors, and (4) oxida-tion ponds. Activated-sludge processes include a well-agitated and aerated continuous-flow re- actor and a settling tank. Depending on the physical design of the tank and how feed is in-troduced into the tank, it may approximate either a PFR or CFSTR. A long narrow tankwith single feed approaches PFR behavior; circular tanks approach CFSTR. The concen-trated cells from the settling tank are recycled back to the stirred-tank reactor. Figure 16.7is a schematic of a typical activated-sludge process. Usually, a mixed culture of organismsis utilized in the bioreactor. Some of these organisms may produce polymeric materials(polysaccharides), which help the organisms to agglomerate. Floc formation is a commonphenomenon encountered in activated-sludge processes, which may impose some masstransfer limitations on the biological oxidation of soluble organics; but good floc forma-tion is essential to good performance of the system, since large dense flocs are required inthe sedimentation step. Cell recycle from the sedimentation unit improves the volumetricrate of biological oxidation (i.e., high-density culture) and therefore reduces the residencetime or volume of the sludge reactor for a given feed rate. The recycle ratio needs to becontrolled to maximize BOD removal rate. The selection of aerator and agitators is a critical factor in the design of activated- sludge processes. The aeration requirements vary depending on the strength of the wastewater and cell concentration. Oxygen requirements for a typical activated-sludge processare about 30 to 60 m 3O2/kg of BOD removed. Various aeration devices with and without Sec. 16.6 Biological Waste Treatment: An Example of Industrial Utilization 491ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 491mechanical agitation can be used in activated-sludge units. Mechanical surface aerators are widely used for shallow activated-sludge units. Surface aerators consist of partiallysubmerged impellers attached to motors mounted on fixed structures. Surface aeratorsspray liquid and create rapid changes at the air-water interface to enhance oxygen transfer.Pure oxygen may be used for high-strength waste-water treatment. Also, stagewise opera-tion with pure oxygen has been found to be a very effective method of waste-water treat-ment. The UNOX Process, first developed by Union Carbide, is based on this concept.Other forms of aeration include bubble aerators and fixed turbines similar to those we dis-cussed in Chapter 10. The activated-sludge system faces many uncontrolled disturbances in input parame- ters, such as waste flow and composition. Such disturbances can lead to system failure(less-than-adequate treatment of the waste stream). One type of disturbance is referred toas shock loading. A shock load indicates the sudden input (pulse) of a high concentration of a toxic compound. A CFSTR design, of course, is less affected by such inputs than aPFR design. One response to disturbances is sludge bulking. A bulking sludge has flocs that do not settle well, and consequently cell mass is not recycled. Bulking sludge often results from a change in the composition of the microbial population in the treatment unit. Forexample, filamentous bacteria may dominate the normal floc-forming cells, leading tosmall, light flocs. Various modifications of activated-sludge processes have been developed. Two ex- amples are the following: 1.Step feed process: The feed stream is distributed along the length of the reactor. Such a configuration converts a conventional PFR system to more CFSTR-like be-havior, which provides greater stability and more effective distribution and utiliza-tion of oxygen and oxygen transfer. 2.Solids reaeration ( contact stabilization ): In the conventional activated sludge process, the dissolved organics are quickly adsorbed onto (or into) the flocs, whilethe actual conversion to CO 2and H2O proceeds much more slowly. In contact stabi- lization, two tanks are used: one (about 1 h residence time) is used to promote theuptake of the organics, and the second (3-6 h residence time) is used for reaerationand the final conversion of the organic material. By concentrating the sludge before 492 Mixed Cultures Chap. 16 Figure 16.7. Schematic diagram of an activated-sludge unit.ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 492oxidation, the total required tank volume for aeration is reduced by 50 %in compar- ison to the conventional system. Using rate expressions for microbial growth and substrate utilization and material bal- ances for biomass and substrate, we can determine the required volume of an activated-sludgetank for a certain degree of BOD removal. Since an activated-sludge tank contains a mixed cul-ture of organisms, the actual kinetics of BOD removal are complicated. Usually, interactionsamong various species are not known. The following analysis is based on pure-culture kinet-ics, which is only an approximation. It is also assumed that the specific growth-rate expressionis given by the Monod equation, with a death rate (or endogenous respiration rate) term (16.29) Steady-state material balances for biomass and rate-limiting substrates in activated-sludge tank are (Fig. 16.7) Biomass: (16.30) Substrate: (16.31) These equations are very similar to the case of the chemostat with recycle that we dis- cussed in Chapter 9. They differ in that we now include the endogenous respiration term. Assuming no substrate utilization and cell growth in the settling tank (short resi- dence times), material balances around the settling tank yield Biomass: (16.32) Substrate: (16.33) where ais the ratio of sludge recycle flow rate to feed flow rate and gis the ratio of excess sludge flow to feed flow rate. Assuming that the substrate is not separated in the settling tank (that is, S=S e=Sr), eq. 16.33 can be eliminated. (solids') residence time, we obtain (16.36) which is used to calculate the cellular (solids') residence time in the sludge tank. The value of qcis controlled by operator choice of recycle flow rates.

The resulting reactor volume can be expressed in terms of the recycle ratio by sub- stituting eq. 16.34 into eq. 16.37 to yield (16.40) The kinetic parameters of the active organisms in the sludge tank need to be known (i.e., mm, Ks, YM X/Sand kd), and other physical parameters ( V, F, a, Xr, X,and S0) need to be determined for the design (sizing, aeration requirement) of activated-sludge units. Typicalhydraulic residence time for the aeration tank is 4 to 12 hours and typical sludge age is3-10 days. A summary of typical values for the kinetic parameters in biological waste treat- ment is presented in Table 16.2. Despite all simplifying assumptions, the pure-culturemodel seems to fit steady-state experimental data reasonably well, although it does notpredict the dynamic performance very well. Example 16.4. An industrial waste with an inlet BOD5of 800 mg/l must be treated to reduce the exit BOD5 level to \u00a320 mg/l. The inlet flow rate is 400 m3/h.

The column is loosely filled with packing material to yield avoid fraction of 0.4 to 0.5. The filter bed is usually arranged in the form of a rather shal-low bed with a high diameter-to-height ratio ( D/H \u00aa3) avoid possible clogging prob- lems and axial variations. Waste-liquid is fed to the top of the bed using rotary liquiddistributors. The waste-liquid flow rate should be low enough to avoid creating shearforces that would remove biofilms from the surfaces of support particles. Air enters thebed from the bottom and moves upward by natural convection. The driving force for aircirculation is the temperature difference created by heat released by biological oxidations.The reaction medium is highly heterogeneous, having temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen,and nutrient profiles throughout the column. The thickness of the biofilm and the compo-sition of the organisms in the biofilm may vary with the length of the column. Dissolved-oxygen limitations are likely because of the high density of cells, unfavorablehydrodynamic conditions, and diffusion barriers within the film. Preaeration of the feedwaste-water stream (to saturate with oxygen) and high liquid circulation rates may partlyalleviate oxygen transfer problems. As the liquid flows downward in the column on the surface of microbial films, or- ganic compounds (substrates) diffuse through the microbial film and are utilized by or-ganisms simultaneously. The liquid film over the biomass film should be thin enough toallow adequate aeration. A typical liquid film thickness is on the order of 0.01 mm, andbiofilm thickness is 0.25 mm. Typical hydraulic residence times in trickling biological fil-ters (TBF) are 0.5 to 4 h for high-rate filters using recirculation of effluent. Trickling fil-ters are more stable against shock loads than are activated-sludge units. Trickling filtersalso entail lower operating costs and often give better effluent clarity compared toactivated-sludge units. However, capital cost and space requirements for trickling filtersare higher than for activated-sludge units, and trickling filters remove a smaller fraction ofthe soluble organics. Also, the maximum concentration of BOD in the influent is moreconstrained in trickling filters than in activated-sludge systems. A major problem with theoperation of trickling filter units is poor control of conditions ( T, pH, DO) due to the het- erogeneous nature of the system. A comparison of trickle biological filters (TBF) withactivated-sludge units (ASU) is presented in Table 16.3. The liquid effluent of TBFs is usually recycled to obtain more complete removal of BOD from waste-water streams. Figure 16.8 is a schematic of a trickling biological filter.

Typical values for rmare 0.2 to 0.5 mg S/l be integrated to yield a substrate concentration profile through- out the column.

Experimental data of ln S0/S0iplotted versus z yield a straight line (in at least some cases), supporting the validity of this analysis.

In practice Kis used as an adjustable parameter in a curve-fitting procedure. Exponents m and nvary depending on system characteristics such as geometry, hydrodynamics, biolog- ical systems, and waste-water characteristics. Rotating biological contactors (RBC) contain rotating disks that come into contact with waste water periodically as they rotate. The disks are made of polystyrene or poly-ethylene, and their diameters range from 2 to 4 m. Figure 16.9 shows rotating disks usedin biological waste treatment. A biological film forms on the surface of the disks. As thedisks come into contact with waste water, nutrients (organics and dissolved oxygen) dif-fuse through the biofilm and are utilized by a mixed culture of organisms within theS PM Page 498biofilm. The design equations for RBCs are similar to those used for trickling biological filters (TBF). RBCs are more compact and efficient than trickling-bed systems. Oxidation ponds provide another inexpensive alternative to activated-sludge and trickling biological filter operations. Oxidation ponds are shallow (2 to 4 ft deep)waste-treatment reactors closely resembling natural aquatic ecosystems. Bacteria andalgae grow in the same pond in a symbiotic relationship. Bacteria oxidize organic com-pounds by utilizing oxygen produced by algae and produce CO 2; algae utilize CO2pro- duced by bacteria and produce oxygen by photosynthesis for bacterial consumption. Suchponds require large land areas, are less efficient than many other techniques, and mayhave adverse environmental side effects. Toxic or hazardous materials may collect in thesediment without degradation, creating a long-term problem. Anaerobic digestion (or biological treatment) is usually used to treat solid wastes and excess sludge produced in aerobic waste-treatment processes. Particulate waste mate-rial removed by screening or sedimentation in primary waste treatment and biomass (con-centrated sludge) produced in activated-sludge units are degraded under anaerobicconditions to produce methane. Anaerobic digestion is a slow process compared to aero-bic processes; typical residence times are 30 to 60 days. The microbiology and biochem-istry of anaerobic digestion are very complicated. However, the major steps involved inthis process are as follows: 1.Solubilization of insoluble organics: Waste material may contain large amounts of solids made of cellulosics (papers, agricultural wastes), starches (potato waste), and othercomplex insoluble organic chemicals. Solubilization of enzymatichydrolysis (cellulases, amylases, glucoamylases, lipases, proteases) is the first step in anaero-bic digestion. These compounds are not readily utilizable by microorganisms, and their hy-drolysis is essential for effective microbial digestion. Sec. 16.6 Biological Waste Treatment: An Example 499 Figure 16.9.

Alcohol formation (butanol, propanol, ethanol) also takes place to a lesser extent. The optimal temperature and pH values for this step are T=35\u00b0C and pH =4-6. The partial pressure of H 2in the reactor can greatly influence metabolism. 3.Formation of methane: V olatile acids and alcohols produced in the second stage are converted to methane and CO2by methanogenic bacteria, which are strictly anaer- obic. Among methanogenic bacteria used for this purpose are (nonspore-forming rods), Methanobacillus (spore-forming rods), and Methanococcus and Methanosarcina (a cocci group growing in cubes of eight cells). The optimal temperature and pH range for methanogenic bacteria are T=35\u00b0 to 40\u00b0C and pH =7 to 7.8. The major biological reaction steps involved in a typical anaerobic digestion process can be represented as follows: Depending on the composition of organic waste, either enzymatic hydrolysis of in- solubles (e.g., cellulosics) or methane production from volatile acids is the rate-limitingstep in this reaction sequence. The concentration of H 2is often critical in determining the rates of these processes. Hydrolysis reactions are usually carried out as a separate step.However, acid-formation and methane-formation steps can be achieved in the same reac-tor. Single- and two-reactor systems have been developed for anaerobic digestion. Thetwo-step reactor scheme has been reported to result in higher reaction rates and methaneyields. The operating conditions in a single-reactor system are pH =6 to 7 and T=35\u00b0 to 40\u00b0C, which result in reasonable rates of acid formation and methane generation. Typicalsolids residence time in an anaerobic digester is 10 to 30 days. Cell yields in anaerobic digesters are low, and a typical value is 0.05 g cells/g COD. Cell yield also varies with substrate. Yield on carbohydrates is larger than yield on theother carbon compounds. Changes in temperature affect the methane-formation rate more than the acid- formation rate. Although the optimal temperature is reported to be 35\u00b0 to 40\u00b0C, in somecases higher removal rates are obtained at higher temperatures ( T=55\u00b0C), depending on the composition of the organisms. The system does not function satisfactorily at tempera-tures below 35\u00b0C, and the temperature of the reactors needs to be controlled for stablemethane generation. The rate of methane formation is considerably lower than the rate of acid formation and is rate-limiting. Sudden increases in organic load concentrations may cause volatileacid (V A) accumulation in the medium, decreasing pH and altering H 2levels, which further depresses methane production. Typical soluble organics removal rates are on thevolatile acids alcohols H CO Page 500order of Certain metal ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) are known to be toxic to organisms of anaerobic digesters at high concentrations ( > 1000 mg/l), although they are stimulatory at low levels ( < 100 mg/l). The composition of the product gas mixture varies, depending on the composition of waste material and other environmental factors. A typical gas composition is 70 %to 75 %CH4, 20 %to 25 %CO2, and 5 %H2S and other gases (NO2, H2, CO). Part of the methane produced in an anaerobic digestion unit is used to heat the digesters to fermenta-tion temperature. The digester gas has a heating value of 24 to 28 million J/m 3, and the yield is 0.75 to 1.2 m3(std)/kg of organic material decomposed, resulting in an energy generation of 18 to 33 million J/kg of organic material. One problem associated with theuse of digester gas is the H 2S content, which can cause foul odors and corrosion and needs to be removed before use. Anaerobic digesters were originally designed as closed stationary tanks. In newer designs, reactor contents are mixed and the reactor is heated. Mixing is accomplished ei-ther by recycling a portion of the gas or by mechanical stirring. The reaction mixture ishighly heterogeneous and viscous and, therefore, difficult to mix. Figure 16.10 is aschematic diagram of an anaerobic digester. Anaerobic digestion can be achieved inpacked beds containing porous solid support particles. Bacteria grow on support surfacesand inside pores, and liquid waste may be trickled through the bed. Solids recyclingschemes have been developed for use with conventional digesters that simulateactivated-sludge units. Solids residence times are considerably higher than hydraulic resi-dence times in these systems, which results in biomass accumulation and higher reactionrates. Continuous plug flow reactors operated in upflow mode are commonly used asanaerobic digesters. The solids content of sludge (waste) is reduced by about 50 %to 60 %at the end of anaerobic digestion. Digested sludge is much less biodegradable than raw sludge and iseasier to dewater. The digester effluent is dewatered by vacuum filtration and is dried. Thedried solids are either incinerated or spread on land as fertilizer. 16.6.3. Advanced Waste-water T reatment Systems Advanced waste-water treatment systems are used for removal of residual nitrogen and phosphorus along with refractory carbonaceous compounds. Examples are for nitrifica-tion and denitrification, phosphate removal processes (e.g., PhoStrip and A/O processes),and combined nitrogen and phosphate removal processes (e.g., A 2O and Bardenpho processes). Nitrogen-containing organic compounds (e.g., amino acids and proteins) are oxi- dized biologically to ammonium, which is further oxidized to nitrite and nitrate by Nitro- somonas and Nitrobacter, respectively. The conversion of ammonium to nitrate by microbial catalysis is called nitrification.

Schroeder, Water and Wastewater Treatment, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York, 1979, p. 327.)ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 502(16.50b) Overall, (16.51) Both of the aforementioned organisms fix carbon dioxide to be used for biosynthesis. Aer- obic nitrification can take place during BOD removal in the presence of these organismsand increases the oxygen requirements in aerobic treatment. These reactions are energy yielding, and the first step (eq. 16.50a) is the rate- limiting one. Nitrification processes can be accomplished in a single stage with BOD re-moval or as a two-stage system with separate BOD removal and nitrification units. Thechoice between the one-stage and two-stage processes typically depends on the ratio ofcarbon to nitrogen in the feed stream. Typically this ratio is expressed as BOD 5/TKN. The growth yield of nitrifying bacteria is low (0.2 g dry wt per g N) and the fraction of thepopulation that is nitrifying bacteria can be low. For example, at BOD 5/TKN =10 the fraction of nitrifying bacteria is 0.02; at BOD5/TKN =0.5 the fraction of nitrifying bacte- ria rises to 0.35. For a single-stage unit with combined BOD removal and nitrification theBOD 5/TKN ratio should be greater than 5. When it is less than 3, the two-stage process is preferred. Nitrification is best accomplished with suspended cells, typically using a modifica- tion of the activated-sludge process. However, fixed-film processes that are well aeratedcan yield nitrification efficiencies over 90 %. In either system DO levels should be high (> 2 mg/l), and slightly alkaline solutions (7.5-8.5) at 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C work best. Under anaerobic conditions, some bacteria utilize nitrate as the final electron accep- tor instead of oxygen. This process is known as denitrification. Two types of nitrate reduc-tion are possible: assimilatory and dissimilatory reduction. In assimilatory reduction,nitrate is reduced to ammonia and is incorporated into cell biomass. However, in dissimi-latory reduction, nitrate is reduced to nitrite and further to elemental nitrogen. An externalcarbon source is needed; this source must be inexpensive (e.g., Assimilatory reduction: (16.52) Dissimilatory reduction: biomass composition of C 5H7NO2and assuming that methanol is used as the carbon source, the overall balance for denitrification can be written as (16.55) Clearly, equations such as 16.55 can be used to predict the amount of carbon source (e.g., methanol) required to remove a known amount of NO- 3.

Such bacteria grow slowly with mg=0.5 d-1and with a yield coefficient of 0.8 g biomass per g nitrogen removed. Saturation constants are low(e.g., 0.1 mg/l <K 5<1 mg/l) for nitrification and denitrification, so these reactions can be approximated as zero order for nitrogen concentrations above about 2 mg/l. Activated-sludge or packed-bed biofilm type reactors may anaerobic denitrification. Upflow packed-bed reactors utilizing biofilms on porous support materialare reported to result in high nitrate removal rates. A typical two-stage nitrification/denitrification process is depicted in Figure 16.11. Optimal pH and temperature values for denitrification are pH =6.5-7 and T =20\u00b0-30\u00b0C. Phosphate removal from waste waters by biological means can be realized either by assimilation or by \"luxury\" phosphate uptake. Assimilation of phosphate occurs in all aer-obic/anaerobic processes since nearly 3 %of cell mass is made of phosphorus. Luxury phosphate uptake is accomplished by organisms belonging to the genera Acinetobacter, among which Acinetobacter calcoaceticus is the most widely known. Acinetobacter species utilize carbohydrates as carbon and energy source by the Entner-Doudoroff path-way. Those organisms utilize acetate and fatty acids under anaerobic conditions to synthe-size polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Energy required for PHB synthesis is obtained fromATP molecules generated by breakdown of polyphosphates. Under aerobic conditions inthe absence of carbon source, the organisms utilize PHB molecules as carbon/energysource to synthesize polyphosphates and store them in form of polyphosphate granules in-side cell. Aerobic polyphosphate synthesis: (16.56) Anaerobic polyphosphate depolymerization: (16.57) Consequently, the organisms remove phosphate from liquid media to synthesize and store polyphosphates under aerobic conditions and release phosphate into the media underanaerobic/anoxic conditions. Acinetobacter species can store polyphosphates up to 30 % of their dry weight. (PO ) H O (PO ) H PO42 4 1 the two-stage 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page phosphate removal bioprocesses, organisms are exposed to alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The two major processes developed to promote luxury phosphateuptake are the A/O (Anaerobic/Oxic) and PhoStrip processes. The A/O process is used for combined BOD and phosphate removal. It is a two- stage process incorporating anaerobic and oxic (aerobic) steps in sequence. In the anaero-bic stage, the phosphate in the recycled sludge is released into liquid media. The releasedphosphate is taken up by the cells under aerobic conditions along with phosphate in thefeed waste-water stream and is stored as polyphosphate granules. Polyphosphate is re-moved from the system by the waste sludge, which has a high value as fertilizer. When theBOD/P ratio in the feed wastewater is greater then 10, the effluent phosphate levels can belower than 1 mg/l (Fig. 16.12). The PhoStrip process consists of an aerobic stage and an anaerobic one on the sludge recycle stream, as shown in Fig. 16.12. The waste-water stream is fed to the aerobicstage for polyphosphate synthesis, the effluent of which is fed to a sedimentation tank.The underflow of the sedimentation tank is fed to the anaerobic stage for phosphate re-lease. The released phosphate is precipitated in a sedimentation tank with the addition oflime in form of calcium phosphate. Part of the sedimented sludge and anaerobic reactorsludge is recyled back to the aerobic stage. Phosphate is removed from the process in the Sec. 16.6 Biological Waste Treatment: An Example 505 Figure 16.12 Phosphate removal processes: (a) Process, (b) PhoStrip Process.ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 505form of calcium phosphate. The effluent water stream would contain less then 1.5 mg/l phosphate in a well-operating PhoStrip process. Combined nitrogen and phosphate removal processes employ combinations of anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic zones in different orders which accomplish simultaneousBOD removal also. The most commonly used processes for this purpose are the A 2/O and the five-stage Bardenpho processes. Among other processes are the UCT (The Universityof CapeTown) and the VIP (Virginia Initiative Plant) processes. The A 2/O process includes an anoxic zone for denitrification in addition to A/O process (Fig. 16.13). Hydraulic residence times in anaerobic and anoxic zones are lessthen 1.5 h, and in the aerobic zone 4-6 h. The effluent of the aerobic stage is recycledback to the anoxic zone for denitrification purposes. Phosphate release takes place in theanaerobic zone. Denitrification and BOD removal are the major functions of the anoxiczone. Phosphate removal in the form of polyphosphates, nitrification, and some BOD re-moval take place in aerobic zone. Phosphate is removed from the system in form of wastesludge; nitrogen is released in form of N 2(gas); and BOD is converted to CO2and H2O. The five-stage Bardenpho process includes two additional anoxic and aerobic zones as compared to the A2/O process (Fig. 16.13). This process is known as the A2/O/A/O process. The effluent of the aerobic zone is partly recycled back to the anoxic zone fordenitrification purposes. The last two zones are for additional denitrification andpolyphosphate removal to further reduce nitrate and phosphate levels in the effluent. Hy-draulic residence times in anaerobic and anoxic zones are less than 4 h and in the firstaerobic zone 4-12 h. The UCT and VIP processes employ similar zones and recycle schemes in different orders, resulting in low nitrogen, phosphate, and BOD levels in the effluent. In some cases sulfur removal from waste water is needed. Elemental sulfur in waste water can be oxidized to sulfate by Thiobacillus species. Sulfate can be further reduced to sulfides by anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria, such as Desulfovibrio, and sulfides can be precipitated out of waste water in the presence of certain metal ions, such as Fe 2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+. Sulfates can also be precipitated with the addition of limestone (CaCO3) and Ca(OH)2and can be filtered out of waste water. 16.6.4 Conversion of Waste Water to Useful Products Some waste materials containing starch and cellulose or other easily utilizable carbona- ceous compounds can easily be converted to useful products such as high-protein feed-stuff or single-cell protein (SCP), ethanol, organic acids (acetic, butyric, propiyonic),methane, and methanol. Agricultural wastes, waste paper, and waste wood constitutemajor cellulosic wastes. Major starch-containing wastes are some agicultural wastes(wheat, corn, rice, potato), some domestic solid wastes (vegetable/fruit), and some indus-trial wastes (food industry). Cellulosic and starch-containing wastes are first hydrolyzed into sugar molecules, which are further converted to high-protein feedstuff (SCP) under aerobic conditions orethanol/organic acids under anaerobic conditions. While many organisms can be used,yeasts, particularly Saccharomyces, are well suited to protein production, since they al- ready have FDA approval for use in foods. The waste must be free of toxic contaminants. 506 Mixed Cultures Chap. 16ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 506Sec. 16.6 Biological Waste Treatment: An Example 507 Figure 16.13 Combined biological nitrogen and phosphate removal processes: (a) A2/O process, (b) five-stage Bardenpho process, (c) UCT process, (d) VIP process.ch16 10/11/01 6:41 PM Page 507To insure complete utilization of mineral nutrients may need to be added to give a C/N/P ratio of 100/15/3. Two widely known processes for conversion of wastes to SCP are the SYMBA and the PEKILO processes. The SYMBA process converts potato wastes to SCP and consistsof two stages. The first stage is for enzymatic hydrolysis of starch by Endomycopsis sp. and the second is for SCP production on glucose by Saccharomyces sp. PEKILO process is based on growth of Paecilomyces sp. on waste sulfite liquor. Such waste materials can also be converted to chemicals such as ethanol for use as a fuel, solvents such as acetone/butanol, or monomers for synthesis of polymers (lacticacid). Conversion of starches to glucose and fermentable sugars is a well-establishedindustry that uses large quantities of enzymes such as a-amylase, b-amylase, and glu- coamylase. The economically feasible conversion of cellulosic wastes into fermentablesugars remains a bioprocess challenge. Many types of cellulases made by microbes can beused; new processes using genetically engineered microbes (e.g., Trichoderma sp.,Ther- momonospora sp., and some Clostrida sp.) may lead to less expensive cellulases. Acid hy- drolysis can be used instead of enzymatic processes but is less environmentally friendly.The economical conversion of cellulosic wastes into products, such as ethanol, would be amajor contribution to human welfare. 16.7 SUMMARY Populations containing multiple species are important in natural ecosystems, well-defined processes, waste-water treatment, and systems using genetically modified cells. Some ex-amples of interactions among these species are competition, neutralism, commensalism, amensalism, predation, and parasitism. In real systems,several modes of interaction may be present. Mathematical analyses can be used to showthat neither pure competition nor pure mutualism gives a stable steady state in a chemo-stat. However, spatial heterogeneity, dynamic fluctuations, and the addition of other inter-actions can lead to the sustained coexistence of species with competitive or mutualisticinteractions. One of the major process uses of mixed cultures is waste-water treatment. The activated-sludge system is commonly employed in treating waste waters. Such a systemcan be considered a chemostat with cell recycle under aerobic conditions. Alternativemethods of aerobic treatment include trickling-bed filters, rotating biological discs, andoxidation ponds. Anaerobic digestion can be used to directly treat waste waters or, morecommonly, to further degrade sludges from the primary and secondary treatment levels ofa waste-treatment plant.

None of the topics hasbeen covered in real depth. Most chapters would require a whole book to provide thatdepth. However, you should now have the vocabulary and perspective to benefit frommore specialized books. Some topics of increasing importance to biotechnology are functional genomics, cell surface receptor-mediated phenomena, high-throughput drug screening, protein engi-neering, metabolic engineering, and tissue engineering. A clear understanding of howcells perceive external signals through cell surface receptors promises to be a key to de-veloping new therapies, as well as to understanding how shear effects in a bioreactor mayalter cellular physiology. Insights into the interrelationship of protein structure with func-tion promise the possibility of large-scale design of custom catalysts and drugs. Here theengineering approach to computational molecular dynamics may yield important divi-dends. Genetic engineering to produce proteins is beginning to mature; the developmentof cells with altered metabolic pathways is at a much earlier stage of development. Theengineer's sense of optimization and the ability to quantitatively model intracellular inter-actions will be critical to the economically attractive development of this technique and itsextension to gene therapy. Engineers will be needed to develop new and effective ways toculture organized tissues and artificial organs. Questions on the relationship of proteinposttranslational processing to the microenvironment about cultured cells will be a key17 Epiloguech17 10/11/01 6:50 PM Page 513factor in more effective scale-up of mammalian cell reactors. The ability to control microenvironmental conditions in a spatially heterogeneous system will be essential. Bio-process engineers can play key roles in developing the experimental tools and computa-tional approaches required for functional genomics. Improvements in the computer models of cellular populations will lead to new in- sights into bioreactor dynamics and appropriate control strategies. Although we have nottalked much about structured and structured-segregated models, recent developments inthis area promise significant rewards. Also, improved models, coupled with a betterunderstanding of transport processes within bioreactors, suggest that rational scale-up ofbioreactors may be achievable. New ideas on the use of cells and enzymes in environments with low water activity (organic or gas phases) may open doors to wholly new bioprocessing opportunities. Sub-strates with low solubility in water may become increasingly important targets forbioprocesses. In addition to the improvements in biocatalysts and our understanding of bioreac- tors, there will be improved understanding and development of bioseparation processes.Significant progress has already been made in affinity separation processes. New mem-brane materials are being rapidly developed. Ideas such as two-phase aqueous systems,reverse micelles, and gel swelling systems may become important tools for the engineer. This discussion of future possibilities is in no way exhaustive. However, the reader must sense that the technological opportunities are expanding rapidly. The recent ad-vances in genomics provide tools that will open new vistas for the bioprocess engineer.Much excitement exists, and rightly so. Now you have a better chance to participate inthis excitement. The purpose of this book has been to give you a foundation. Build upon itand join the biological revolution. 514 Epiloguech17 10/11/01 6:50 PM Page 514Appendix 515Enzymes and microbial cells are used for production of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, foods, flavors and fragrances, and vitamins and for waste treatment. Each of these bio-processes has unique characteristics in terms of the processing and separation technolo-gies involved. Having covered the basics of bioprocess engineering, this appendixpresents some examples of industrial bioprocesses and technologies used for productionof various chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Waste-treatment aspects of bioprocess engi-neering are covered in Chapter 16. A.1. ANAEROBIC BIOPROCESSES A.1.1. Ethanol ProductionEthanol has many applications as a raw material, solvent, and fuel and is utilized in large quantities in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Worldwide, four milliontons of industrial ethanol are produced annually, 80% by fermentation. It is expected thatthe demand for ethanol as a fuel oxygenate will increase. An annual growth of U.S.ethanol consumption of 3.2% over the next 20 years has been predicted by the EnergyInformation Administration.Traditional Industrial Bioprocessesappx 10/11/01 7:37 PM Page 515Yeasts are the preferred organisms for industrial-scale ethanol production. Different species can be utilized, depending on the composition of the raw material utilized. S. cere- visiae , particularly suitable for fermentation of hexoses, has been the major organism used so far. Kluyveromyces fragilis or Candida sp. can be utilized when lactose or pentoses, re- spectively, are the available substrates. Other alternative organisms capable of producingethanol such as Zymomonas mobilis, Pachysolen sp., are not used in industrial production. However, Zymomonas species have significant advantages over yeast and may be used at industrial scale in the future. Other pentose and hexose provide significant advantages for ethanol fermentations and separation.However, they produce some undesirable end products and yield dilute ethanol solutions.Genetic engineering has transformed E. coli into a very efficient ethanol producer, reach- ing ethanol concentrations up to 43% (vol/vol). Raw materials can constitute up to 70% of the cost of ethanol production. There- fore, the selection of inexpensive materials has an important impact on process eco-nomics. The material selected should be readily and economically available in thefermentation plant. In Brazil cane sugar is extensively used, while in the United Statessugar prices make sugar a nonviable raw material. Instead, corn is the most utilized mate-rial in the United States for the production of industrial ethanol. Most microorganisms re-quire readily available sugar compounds for fermentation. Such sugar compounds arepresent in inexpensive raw materials, as sugar cane, sweet sorghum, or sugar beet juicesand molasses. Whey is also utilized in commercial fermentation. Starch- and cellulose-containing materials, such as grains, fruits, vegetables, wood, biomass, waste paper, andagricultural wastes, can also be used, but they need to be hydrolyzed before fermentation.Starch is enzymatically saccharified before fermentation. Acid hydrolysis of starch is notrecommended, as it can result in nonfermentable or inhibitory by-products. Hydrolysis ofcellulosic materials can be difficult, expensive, and inefficient. However, interest exists onincreasing their utilization in an effort to recycle wastes. Yeast convert hexoses to ethanol and carbon dioxide by glycolysis, as shown by the following reaction: (A.1) The theoretical ethanol yield over glucose is 0.51 g/g, and the growth yield over glucose is 0.12 g/g. Usually by-products such as glycerol, succinic acid, and acetic acid are pro-duced, and the actual yield is about 90-95% of the theoretical yield. Optimal temperatureand pH values for yeast are 30\u00b0 to 35\u00b0C and 4-6, respectively. For thermophilic organismsoptimal temperature may range from 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0C. Ethanol production is triggered byanaerobic conditions. Trace amounts of oxygen (0.05-0.1 mm Hg) are required by yeastfor lipid biosynthesis and maintenance of cellular processes. The feed solution should be balanced in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus, minerals, and some trace elements. Glucose medium is usually supplemented with NH 4Cl, KH2PO4, MgSO4, CaCl2, and yeast extract. In industry, only some ammonium and phosphate salts need to be added to diluted molasses. Glucose concentration in feed solution has an im-portant effect on the rate and extent of ethanol production. Glucose concentrations above100 g/l are inhibitory for yeast.C H O C H OH 2CO61 2 2 5 62 2 \u00e6\u00c6 + 516 Traditional Industrial Bioprocesses Appendixappx 10/11/01 7:37 PM Page 516Ethanol and some of other by-products are inhibitory to yeast above concentra- tions of 5% (vol/vol). Therefore, the glucose concentration in feed solution in continuousfermentation should be less than 100 g/l, resulting in ethanol concentration in the effluentbelow 50 g/l. Ethanol-tolerant yeast strains are being developed to avoid ethanol inhibi-tion. Simultaneous removal of ethanol from fermentation broth is another alternative foralleviation of ethanol inhibition. Conventional ethanol fermentations operate in batch mode under aseptic conditions. Mechanically agitated stainless-steel reactors are used for this purpose. A reactor is filledwith a nutrient medium up to 70% of its volume. After pH and temperature adjustment thereactor content is sterilized and cooled to fermentation temperature. Temperature and pHare controlled during operation, and redox potential is kept below -100 mV by using re- ducing agents such as Na 2S. A sterile yeast culture is prepared and used for inoculation of the reactor. A batch fermentation cycle lasts nearly 30-40 hours. Part of the yeast andaqueous medium can be recycled. Batch operation with cell recycle (the Melle-BoinotProcess) results in reduced fermentation times (10 h) and improved productivities of 6 g/l h. At the end of batch operation the reactor content is emptied and yeasts are sepa-rated by filtration or centrifugation. The liquid broth is further processed for separation ofethanol by distillation. Continuous operation in ethanol fermentations has significant advantages over batch operation. With continuous media sterilization and aseptic operation techniques,contamination problems associated with continuous operation can be eliminated. About95% of sugar can be converted to ethanol in continuous operation with a residence time of21 h, as compared to batch operation time of 40 h. Under optimized conditions the resi-dence time for 95% conversion can be as low as 10 h. Continuous operation with cell re-cycle may increase fivefold the cell concentration in the reactor, resulting in fasterconversion. Sedimentation tanks, centrifuges, or filters can be used for cell separationfrom the fermenter effluent. With cell recycle, the residence time for 95% conversion maybe reduced to 1.6 h with a productivity of 30 g/l h for a feed glucose of 100 g/l. Multistagecontinuous operation with cell recycle may further improve the productivity of theprocess. When six fermenters in series are used without cell recycle, it is possible to ob-tain 95 g/l in 9 h of total residence time and a productivity of 11 g/l h. Figure A.1 depicts the biostill process used for ethanol fermentations. This process employs continuous operation with cell recycle and a distillation column for ethanol sepa-ration. A mechanically agitated stainless-steel fermenter is used in continuous mode, andthe effluent is centrifuged for yeast separation. Part of the separated yeast is recycled backto the fermenter, and the liquid medium is fed to a distillation column for separation ofethanol. Ethanol-free medum is recycled back to the fermenter. Yeast cell recycle provideshigh conversion rates, and liquid recycle reduces the amount of waste water generated anddilutes the feed sugar concentration down to noninhibitory levels. Immobilization of yeast within porous or polymeric matrices results in high cell concentrations in the reactor and, therefore, high ethanol productivities. Immobilized cellreactors may be in form of packed columns or fluidized beds. Some flocculating yeaststrains that settle rapidly may also be used in tower fermenters to obtain high cell concen-trations. A comparison of industrial processes used for ethanol production is presented in Table A.1. Sec. A.1 Anaerobic Bioprocesses 517appx 10/11/01 7:37 PM Page 517Ethanol can be separated from the culture vessel during fermentation using low- temperature vacuum distillation, adsorption, or membrane separations. This reducesethanol inhibition but is seldom used in industry because of operating difficulties. Separa-tion of ethanol from fermentation broth is usually accomplished by distillation, which isenergy intensive and constitutes more than 50% of the total energy consumption of theplant. The grade of industrial ethanol is usually 95% (190 proof) for chemical and phar-maceutical use, which can be obtained by using distillation columns. However, it is diffi-cult to obtain 100% pure ethanol, since 95% ethanol in water constitutes an azeotropicmixture. A third component is added to alcohol-water mixture to break the azeotrope, butthis is expensive and the third component may be toxic. The cost of ethanol production mainly depends on the raw material and operating costs (chiefly electricity and water cooling). Total operating cost for an ethanol plant pro-ducing 190 million liters of ethanol per year is estimated to be 42 cents/l (2001 basis).Raw materials costs constitute 26 cents/l; utilities, 3.4 cents/l; labor, 6 cents/l; and fixedcharges (depreciation, taxes, insurance, maintenance), 6.6 cents/l. Plant capital investmentfor the same size plant is estimated to be $71 million. Produced ethanol can be used assolvent, chemical intermediate (for production of acetaldehyde, acetic acid, ethylene), andfuel. In recent years there has been an increasing demand for ethanol utilization as fuel in 518 Traditional Industrial Bioprocesses AppendixTABLE A.1.

However, the use of ethanol as fuel can be viable only if its cost is comparable to that of oil-derived fuels. A.1.2. Lactic Acid Production Lactic acid was first isolated from sour milk (1780) and has two optically active forms called D- and L-lactic acids. The major use of L-lactic acid is in foods (more than 50%) as an acidulant and preservative. Lactic acid is also used as a chemical intermediate to pro-duce other chemicals and in the pharmaceutical industry. Most lactic acid is produced byfermentation. In industry, usually a mixture of lactic acid bacteria is used to ferment a mixture of carbohydrates. A mixture of strains may result in faster fermentation rates than pure cul-tures. Selected organisms should grow fast, produce lactic acid with high yields and pro-ductivities, and have low nutritional requirements. Lactic acid formation is a mixedgrowth associated process that requires high growth rate and cell concentration. Lactic-acid-producing bacteria are classified in two major groups, homolactic ( Lactobacillus sp., Streptococcus sp., Pediococcus sp.) and heterolactic bacteria (some Streptococcus sp., Leuconostoc sp.). Homolactic species of Lactobacillus andStreptococcus are usually used for the in- dustrial production of lactic acid. Homolactic bacteria use the EMP pathway to generatetwo moles of pyruvate from one mole of glucose that are further reduced to lactic acid, assummarized below. (A.2) The product yield over glucose is usually above 0.9 g/g. The organisms are facultative anaerobes, but generate ATP only by anaerobic fermentation. Industrially important ho-molactics grow at temperatures above 40\u00b0C and pH between 5 and 7. High temperatureand low pH (pH < 6) reduce the risk of contamination. Homolactic bacteria can producelactic acid from pentoses as well as hexoses other than glucose. Usually lactic and aceticacids are produced from fermentation of pentoses. Most of the lactic acid bacteria also re-quire several B vitamins, amino acids, and phosphate. Peptides may increase cell growthrate. Fermentation yield varies, depending on substrate and the organism used. Heterolactic fermentation is undesirable because of by-product formation. However, depending on microbial flora, energy availability, and fermentation conditions, it mayoccur. Heterolactic bacteria produce one mole of lactic acid, ethanol, and CO 2from one mole of glucose as shown below. (A.3) The theoretical lactic acid yield is 0.5 grams per gram of glucose. Some species of Rhizopus (e.g., R. oryzae ) have low nutritional requirements and can be used to produce lactic acid from carbohydrates. They have the advantage of pro-ducing stereochemically pure L-(+)-lactic acid. Rhizopus species can also utilize starch for the production of lactic acid. The ideal raw material must be inexpensive, must result in high rates with high product yields and no by-product formation, should not require significant pretreatment,CH O CHO CHO H C O61 26 363 2 5 2 \u00e6\u00c6 + +CH O should be available year around. Sucrose from sugar cane or sugar beet juice, lactose from cheese whey, and maltose or dextrose from hydrolyzed starch are used as raw mate-rials in industry. Molasses can also be used; however, its complex nature makes separationof lactic acid problematic. Dextrose from corn starch was the most commonly used rawmaterial in the late 1950s. Other processes based on pasteurized milk ( L. ), crude sorghum extract, and potato hydrolysate have also been developed. Direct hydrolysis and fermentation of corn starch by certain Lacto- bacillus species seem to be quite promising from the economical point of view. Nitrogen sources such as malt extract, corn steep liquor, barley, and yeast extract should be addedto the fermentation media to improve growth and lactic acid formation. Industrial processes are operated batchwise (Fig. A.2). Fermenters are made of stainless steel and are equipped with heat-transfer coils. Vessels are steam-sterilized be-fore being filled with a pasteurized medium. Slow agitation to prevent settling of calciumcarbonate is provided with top-mounted mechanical stirrers. Fermentation conditions aredifferent for each industrial producer, but are usually in the range of T= 45-60\u00b0C and pH = 5-6.5 for L. delbruckii; T = 43\u00b0C, pH = 6-7 for L. bulgaricus; and T= 30-50\u00b0C, pH < 6 for Rhizopus . The fermentation time is 1 to 2 days for a 5% sugar source such as whey, and 2 to 6 days for a 15% glucose or sucrose source. Under optimal conditions theprocessing time may be reduced to 1-2 days. The rate of lactic acid formation depends ontemperature, pH, sugar, nitrogen, and lactic acid concentrations. Temperature and pH con-trol at optimum levels improves the rate of lactic acid formation. Produced lactic acidmust be neutralized, usually by addition of calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide. CO 2 is continuously released during fermentation, which creates anaerobic conditions in thefermenter. Lactic acid formation productivities are in the range of 1-3 kg/m 3h. The yield of lactic acid at the end of fermentation is 90-95% of initial sugar concentration. Cellmass yield is usually less than 15% of initial sugar concentration; however, the yield maybe as high as 30%, depending on the organism and culture conditions. 520 Traditional Industrial Bioprocesses Appendix Figure A.2. Process diagram for lactic acid production.appx 10/11/01 7:37 PM Page 520Continuous, high cell density and immobilized cell reactors have been used for laboratory-scale lactic acid fermentations. Productivity and yield (100 kg/m3) of lactic acid formation are higher in such reactors than in batch cultures. Continuous removal oflactic acid from cultures by dialysis membranes increases production rates. Recovery of lactic acid from the fermentation broth constitutes a significant part of production cost. The use of pure sugar solutions with minimal amounts of nitrogen sim-plifies product recovery. A process diagram is shown in Fig. A.2. The first step is to in-crease the temperature of the fermenter to 80-100\u00b0C and the pH to 10-11. This procedurekills the organisms, coagulates the proteins, solubilizes calcium lactate, and degradessome of the residual sugars. The liquid is then filtered to remove biomass, and sulfuricacid is added to obtain lactic acid. Calcium sulfate is removed by filtration, and lactic acidis then concentrated. Alternatively, purification of lactic acid may be accomplished by cal-cium lactate precipitation. The fermenter broth is filtered and evaporated to 25% lacticacid. The calcium lactate is then crystallized and separated from the mother liquor. Sev-eral purification procedures can be performed to obtain lactic acid of different grades.These include bleaching with activated carbon, ion exchange, electrodialysis, solvent ex-traction, and esterification. Edible lactic acid is lactic over 90% pure lactic acid. Traditionally, polymer-grade lactic acid had to be as pure as possible. However, recently polylactate has been ob-tained from industrial-grade lactic acid. World demand for lactic acid is estimated as $150 million (100,000 tons). About 50% of the market is in food and beverage applications, which is a mature and stable mar-ket. However, niche applications of lactic acid are expected to increase its demand. Theseinclude biodegradable polymers, solvents, and cleaning agents. An annual growth of 8.6%of the lactic acid market is expected between 2000 and 2003. Major producers of lactic acid are United States, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and Brazil. China and India are also producers. The price of pure lactic acid isabout $2.3/kg (2000). Derivatives of lactic acid such as calcium lactate sell at a higherprice ($2.8/kg, 2000 basis). Assuming 20% profit margin, one can estimate the manufac-turing price of lactic acid approximately as $1.8/kg. A.1.3. Acetone-Butanol Production Acetone is used mainly as a solvent for fats, oils, waxes, resins, lacquers, and rubber plas- tics. Butanol is used in the production of lacquers, rayon, detergents, and brake fluids; andas a solvent for fats, waxes, and resins. Butanol is a better fuel additive than ethanol be-cause of its low vapor pressure, low solubility with water, and complete solubility withdiesel fuel. Acetone and butanol (A/B) are produced from petrochemical industry interme-diates. However, it is expected that the demand for cleaner processes and shortage of oil-derived products will require production by fermentation. Clostridium species are used for acetone-butanol production. C. acetobutylicum is a strict anaerobe with a versatile metabolic capacity. It has amylolytic and saccharolytic en-zymes to hydrolyze starch to glucose maltose. acetobutylicum can fer- ment a large number such as glucose, lactose, fructose, galactose,xylose, sucrose, maltose, and starch. The Anaerobic Bioprocesses and butyric acids, CO2, and hydrogen are also produced in small amounts. Starch, molasses, cheese whey, Jerusalem artichoke, and lignocellulosic hy- drolyzates can be used as raw material for acetone-butanol fermentations. More than oneof these carbon sources may be utilized simultaneously. The composition of culturemedium determines the butanol-to-acetone ratio obtained and can be manipulated to ob-tain the desired ratio. Molasses can be used as carbon source (6% sucrose) with the addi-tion of nitrogen and phosphate. Higher concentrations of sucrose in molasses increase theratio of butanol to acetone and ethanol. Average solvent yields of 30% were reportedwhen molasses was used. Utilizing a 5-6% starch solution derived from corn, approxi-mately 38% solvent yield can be obtained. A butanol-to-acetone ratio of 2.75 was ob-tained using Jerusalem artichoke rich in inulin. Cheese whey with nearly 6% lactose and 1% protein content can be used as carbon and nitrogen source for acteone-butanol fermentation. Somewhat different product distri-bution is obtained when cheese whey is used as carbon source. When corn mash was alsoadded, the butanol-to-acetone ratio was 2. With pure glucose or pure lactose this ratio is2.7 and 2.9, respectively. When ultrafiltrate of cheese whey was used, butanol-to-acetoneratio of 10 was obtained without any intermediate buildup of acetic and butyric acids. Lignocellulosics hydrolyzates (wood, paper, crop residues) contain glucose, galac- tose, mannose, and pentose sugars, most of which are fermentable by C. acetobutylicum to acetone and butanol. However, since hydrolysis of lignocellulosics is difficult, this rawmaterial is not commonly used for A/B fermentations. Alternatively, cocultures with cellu-lolytic clostridia can be performed. A schematic of the process is depicted in Fig. A.3. The Weizmann process utilizes starch as raw material for A/B fermentation. C. acetobutylicum hydrolyzes gelatinized corn starch to glucose and maltose with amylolytic enzymes. The grain mesh is first gela-tinized at 65\u00b0C for 20 min and then sterilized at 105\u00b0C for 60 min. The cooked mash iscooled down to 35\u00b0C using heat exchangers and is pumped to presterilized fermenters of250-2000 m 3. The fermenter is inoculated with a 5% inoculum from a 24 h culture. The final butanol-to-acetone ratio increases as the inoculum age increases. In some cases, 30-40% of the total volume of the mash is provided by stillage after solvents from theprevious fermentation are stripped. Batch fermentation period is usually 2-2.5 days. First,rapid growth and production of acetic/butyric acids and carbon dioxide and hydrogenoccur. The initial pH of the medium drops from 6.5 to nearly 4.5 during this phase. In asecond phase, growth ceases, and the organisms convert acetic and butyric acids to neutralacetone and butanol. The acidity of the medium decreases, and gas production increases.At the end of the fermentation the pH is approximately 5. The South African process utilizes cane molasses as raw material and C. aceto- butylicum . Stainless-steel fermenters of 90 m 3are used in batch operation. The effluent contains 2% A/B, and the solvents are recovered by distillation. Acetone/butanol andethanol/isopropyl alcohol are obtained as separate fractions. The biomass, rich in ri-boflavin and B vitamins, is concentrated, dried, and used as animal feed supplement. Dueto the high price of molasses this process is operated intermittently. A process based onutilization of cheese whey for production of A/B has been developed. If the plant is placednear cheese manufacturers, this process can be more attractive than that based onmolasses. 522 Traditional Industrial Bioprocesses Appendixappx 10/11/01 7:37 PM Page 522Different approaches have been developed to improve solvent yield in A/B fermen- tations. Phosphate limitation and addition of acetic and butyric acids improve butanol pro-ductivity. Calcium present in cheese whey complexes phosphate and also improvesbutanol yield. Hydrogen saturation in the medium at low agitation rates (25 rpm) and highhead-space pressure improves butanol yield. Overall, butanol productivity may be im-proved by moderate to high agitation (300 rpm) during the acid phase followed by low ag-itation (25 rpm) during the solvent phase. Simultaneous removal of inhibitory products(butanol, acetone) by adsorption (activated carbon) or extraction (corn oil, paraffin oil)improves fermentation productivities. Organisms can tolerate up to 1.2% (vol/vol) ofbutanol. Continuous or fed-batch operations improve solvent productivities. The possibility of controlling the growth rate and environmental and nutritional conditions improves bu-tanol productivities (2.5 g/l h), as compared to batch cultures (0.8 g/l h). Immobilized cul-tures of C. acetobutylicum are also used for A/B fermentations with high productivities (1.2 g/l h). Biochemical and genetic manipulations of cells may further improve the sol-vent yield. To recover acetone and butanol, at the end of the solvent phase the broth is trans- ferred to a beer still that concentrates solvents (Fig. A.3). Solvents are then separated byfractionation, and the stillage is dried. Acetone and butanol prices have decreased due to adecrease in demand and excessive production capacity. It is expected that acetone demandwill increase 4% per year from 2000 to 2006 to 5 million tons, while the production ca-pacity in 2006 will be 5.3 million tons. An economic evaluation was presented for A/B Sec. A.1 Page 523fermentation from cheese whey in 1982. For a plant producing 45,000 tons of solvents per year, the total capital investment including the waste-water treatment was estimated to be$28 million and the total production cost was nearly $37 million, with an annual incomeof nearly $53 million and an annual profit of $16 million. Nowadays, production by fer-mentation is not economically attractive due to low levels of product concentrations (0.7-1.5%) and high cost of product recovery. However, fermentation may be the pre-ferred method for production of A/B if a shortage of oil products exists, or as demands forenvironmentally friendly processes increase. A.2. AEROBIC PROCESSES Aerobic bioprocesses are widely used for the production of organic acids (citric, acetic, gluconic), vitamins, antibiotics, enzymes, flavors-fragrances, amino acids. Owing tospace limitations only a few examples of aerobic bioprocesses will be presented here. A.2.1. Citric Acid Production Citric acid present in citrus fruits was first crystalized from lemon juice in form of cal- cium citrate. Later on, citric acid was synthesized from glycerol. Production of citric acidfrom sugar solutions by aerobic bioprocesses was first realized by using Penicillium. Due to low yields obtained from Penicillium, Aspergillus niger was utilized in subsequently developed processes. Citric acid is used as an acidulant in food, confectionery, and beverages (75%). Pharmaceutical (10%) and industrial (15%) applications are also significant. Citric acidcomplexes with heavy metals such as iron and copper and can be used as a stabilizer of oiland fats. In the pharmaceutical industry, citric acid can be used in antacids, soluble aspirinpreparations, and as a stabilizer of ascorbic acid. Metal salts of citric acid such astrisodium citrate are used to prevent blood clotting by complexing calcium. Trisodium cit-rate can be used in detergents and cleaners as a cleaning agent instead of phosphates. Aspergillus niger is the most widely used organism for citric acid production from molasses or sugar solutions. Candida yeast can also be used for producing citric acid from carbohydrates or n-alkanes, with yields as high as 225 g/l. Beet or cane molasses can be used as source of carbohydrates for citric acid production. The concentration of heavymetals such as iron and manganese must be reduced. Typical trace-element concentrationsare 0.3 ppm zinc, 1.3 ppm iron, and Mn <0.1 ppm. High concentrations of metals can be reduced with the addition of Na- or K-ferrocyanide. Additions of nitrogen, phosphate, andother inorganic salts may not be required. Utilization of pure glucose or sucrose solutionsis expensive and requires additions of nitrogen (NH 4+), phosphate, and inorganic salts. Be- cause of its low price and nutrient-rich nature, molasses is usually preferred to pure sugarsolutions. Citric acid production is mixed growth associated, mainly taking place under nitro- gen and phosphate limitations after growth has ceased. Since citric acid is a product ofprimary metabolism, it is produced in high concentrations only under very specific condi-tions. These include restricted growth, medium deficient in one or more essential ele-ments, high sugar concentration, high dissolved-oxygen concentration, pH below 2, and 524 Traditional Industrial Bioprocesses Appendixappx 10/11/01 7:37 PM Page 524absence of trace metals. Such conditions provoke an overflow in metabolism that results in an overproduction of citric acid. Oxalic and gluconic acids are also produced if the pHis above 2. Potassium ferrocyanide is added to reduce the concentration of metals and is agrowth inhibitor that promotes the production of citric acid. The metabolic imbalance thatresults in citric acid production also alters the morphology of fungi. The hyphae becomeshort, stubby, and forked in small pellets (0.2-0.5 mm in diameter). Limitation of certainnutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate stimulates citric acid formation. High dissolved-oxygen concentrations must be maintained throughout the culture. Even short interrup-tions in oxygen provision can result in irreversible decreases in acid production rate. Citric acid was historically produced by surface fermentation of beet molasses, and this process is still employed by some manufacturers. It is labor intensive, but power re-quirements are lower than for submerged fermentation. The surface process is realized onsurface-aerated trays with liquid depth of 5-20 cm. Sterilized diluted beet molasses, witha sugar concentration of 150 g/l and a pH of 6, is placed on trays in a temperature-controlled (30\u00b0C) and aerated clean room. Sterilized additional nutrients and alkali ferro-cyanide are added into the medium. Spores of a selected strain of A. niger are spread over the liquid on trays. The clean chamber is aerated with filter-sterilized air to provide oxy-gen to the organisms and to remove fermentation heat. Mycelium forms a layer on the sur-face of the medium. After 7-10 days of incubation the trays are emptied, the mycelium isremoved, and the medium is transferred to the recovery section. The production of unde-sirable products such as gluconic and oxalic acids can be avoided by strain selection. After the Second World War submerged fermentation processes utilizing molasses or pure sugar solutions were developed. The submerged process is realized in deepstainless-steel vessels of 100 m 3or larger by batch or fed-batch operation. The fermenters may be mechanically agitated or aerated towers with an internal recycle draft tube. Aera-tion is provided to the fermenter by air sparging (0.1 to 0.4 vvm), and temperature is con-trolled with cooling coils. Agitation is usually gentle (50-100 rpm) to avoid shear damageon molds. Diluted molasses supplemented with other nutrients is on-line sterilized andadded to the fermenter. Sterilization in the fermenter is also possible. The initial pH is ad-justed at 2.5 to 3. Spores of A. niger are allowed to germinate in an inoculum medium be- fore being transferred to the main fermenter. In some cases, spores are directly introducedinto the fermentation media (5 to 25 \u00a510 6spores/l). Since dissolved-oxygen concentra- tion is critical for citric acid production, oxygen-enriched air may be used in some cases.About 80% of the supplied carbon is converted to citric acid in a typical fermentation.Batch operation usually results in productivities of 0.5-1 kg/m 3h. Fed-batch operation can be performed to avoid substrate inhibition and to prolong the production phase one ortwo days after growth cessation. Typical volumetric yields of fed-batch processes arearound 130 kg/m 3. When citric acid production stops, usually after 4-5 days, the fer- menters are emptied and the biomass is separated from the broth by filtration. The liquidis transferred to the recovery section. Precipitation is usually accomplished by addition of calcium hydroxide (lime) to the heated fermentation broth to obtain calcium citrate tetrahydrate. The precipitate is thenwashed and treated with or monohydrate citric acid is obtained. Solvent extraction is another option for recovery ofcitric acid, although it is not used commercially. Extraction avoids the use of lime and Sec. A.2 Aerobic Processes 525appx 10/11/01 7:37 PM Page 525H2SO4and gypsum formation; however, it may result in extraction of some impurities present in molasses. Ketones, hydrocarbons, ethers, and esters can be used as extractants.Extraction of citric acid is realized at low temperature, and the solvent is then strippedwith hot water. Almost no information is available on process economics for citric acid production because of the proprietary nature of production schemes. The demand for citric acid in1999 was 400,000 tons ($1,400 million). It is expected to increase 3% annually through2003. A.2.2. Production of Bakers' Y east Bakers' yeast is essential to the modern baked goods with which we are familiar. The earli- est production of bakers'yeast was accomplished by a Dutch process (1781), utilizing grainmash as raw material. Later on, sugar solutions and aeration were used in Germany. Theprocess was further improved to avoid ethanol formation and to improve biomass yield.Today, bakers' yeast worldwide production is at the level of a million tons per year. Theprocess is based on aerobic cultivation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on carbohydrates. Today the most widely used organism for baking is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the past (prior to the nineteenth century) other strains of Saccharomyces such as S. uvarum orS. carlsbergensis (brewers' yeast) had been used. However, S. cerevisiae is superior to other species of yeast for baking purposes, primarly due to its ability to gener-ate gas (e.g., CO 2) in the dough. The most suitable yeast strains are selected in the labora- tory and are stored by freeze drying. Molasses is the most used carbon and energy source for production of bakers' yeast. It is inexpensive, rich in nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and minerals), and is availableyear around. Other carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, or starchcan be used. Aqueous ammonia (NH 4OH), ammonium salts, or urea may be used as nitro- gen sources. Phosphoric acid may also be added as phosphate source. Addition of someMg and Fe salts may be needed. Some yeast strains require B vitamins as well as Na, K,Mg, Ca, and sulfate ions for effective growth. A material balance for bakers' yeast formation can be written as follows: (A.4) Typical yields are about 0.5 gram of cells per gram of substrate and 1 g of cells per gram of oxygen. The maximum specific growth rate of yeast is 0.6 h -1(doubling time of 1.2 h). The temperature and pH of the fermentation medium are controlled at 30\u00b0C and6-7, respectively. High dissolved-oxygen concentrations (above 2 mg/l) are required topromote biomass production. High carbohydrate concentrations may provoke ethanol pro-duction even in aerobic conditions (the Crabtree effect). Ethanol is inhibitory to cellgrowth and reduces biomass yield. Growth of yeast results in a highly viscous culture broth. Consequently, mechani- cally agitated fermenters are preferred over airlifts or aerated columns. Typical reactorshave a working capacity of 50 m 3to 350 m3with a height-to-diameter ratio of 3. Vigorous aeration and agitation are required to provide oxygen for biomass production. ReactorsSucrose (200 g) NH (10.3 g) O (100.5 g) Minerals (7.5 g) Biomass (100 g) CO (140.g) H O (78 g)32 22++ PM Page 526are aerated in the bottom by perforated horizontal pipe spargers. Stirred tanks utilized for yeast production typically have oxygen transfer rates of 1 mole O2/l h and KLa of 600 h-1. Temperature control is accomplished by cooling coils, and pH is controlled by addition ofacid or base. Dissolved-oxygen concentration and foam are also controlled. Some plantsare computerized and automatically controlled. To avoid the Crabtree effect, production of bakers' yeast is performed in fed-batch mode. The inoculum is prepared in smaller tanks and is added to the production fer-menters. Multistage fermenters can be used for production. Diluted molasses, ammoniumor urea, phosphoric acid, and mineral salts are stored in different tanks. The process startsbatchwise after filling and sterilization of the fermenter content. Intermittent feeding ofcontinuously sterilized nutrients starts when the initial charge of nutrients is depleted. Thefeeding rates of nutrients are adjusted to maximize growth rate. Dissolved-oxygen moni-toring can be utilized to evaluate the metabolic activity of yeast and is the basis for feed-back control systems for nutrient addition. After 20 to 30 h of culture, the broth is transferred to centrifuges for separation of yeast. The cells are washed several times to remove inert solids. Centrifugal separation re-sults in a light colored cream with up to 22% solids from yeast. The cream is stored in ag-itated tanks at 2-4\u00b0C, and part is used for seeding additional fermentations. Bakers' yeastcan be sold in the form of cream, in compressed form (30% yeast solids), or dried (95%yeast solids). Filter press or rotary vacuum filters are used to concentrate cream. The fil-tered yeast may be mixed with emulsifiers prior to being extruded into yeast cakes orpackaged in large paper bags. Fresh bakers' yeast may be marketed as free-flowing parti-cles by adding ingredients such as modified starch or micronized cellulose. To produce active dry yeast, the filtered yeast cake is extruded into particles that are dried in a hot air stream. Drying temperature, drying rate, and final moisture content ofthe dried yeast should be controlled during drying. The drying temperature is usually45\u00b0C. Most of the vegetative yeast cells are killed at temperatures above 50\u00b0C. Dryingtime may vary from 20 min to several hours, depending on the type of drier used. Thefinal moisture content of yeasts after drying is about 5-10%. Several types of driers canbe used. The Roto-Louvre drier is an empty cylinder rotating at 1-4 rpm. Heated air at50-60\u00b0C is blown to the cylinder containing yeast particles. The drying temperature is45\u00b0C and the duration is 10-15 h. In fluidized bed driers, hot air (50-60\u00b0C) is blown fromthe bottom of the column to keep the cells suspended in air. The drying temperature andtime are 45\u00b0C and 1-2 h, respectively. Spray driers are the most widely used. A suspen-sion with 10-20% yeast is atomized into a drying chamber and dried with hot air. Thedrying temperature and time are 50\u00b0C and 10-20 min, respectively. Product quality de-pends mainly on gassing activity of yeast. Presence of certain carbohydrates such astrehalose or glycogenin increases the gassing activity of yeast. Highly stable active dry yeastcan be obtained from cultures with a high protein content. Fluidized bed or spray driersyield fine yeast particles of 0.2-2 mm with high protein content and high gassing activity. A.2.3. Production of Penicillins Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming (see Chapter 1). Different penicillins are produced by different strains of Penicillium. Chemical structures of penicillins G and V are given in Fig. A.4. Sec. A.2 Aerobic Processes 527appx 10/11/01 1,670 U/mg) is administered par- enterally, as it is degraded in acid conditions; penicillin V (MW = 372.4 KDa, Activity:1,595 U/mg) is acid stable and is orally administered. Both forms are active against Grampositive bacteria by inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Different species of the genus Peni- cillium produce different forms of penicillin. The strain used by Fleming was P . notatum. Later on, different strains were used, such as P . chrysogenum, which is the most widely used strain in industry. Before utilization in industrial scale, considerable efforts must bespent in strain selection and development to improve the yield and activity of penicillinformation. Selected strains are stored in the form of lyophilized spores. Vegetative cellsmay be frozen at -70\u00b0C with glycerol as a suspending medium. P . chrysogenum can use a variety of carbohydrates and oils as carbon and energy sources. Among those are glucose, sucrose, hydrolyzed starch, lactose, and molasses.Corn oil supplemented with lactose results in fast production of highly concentrated peni-cillin. Medium formulation has changed significantly with new developments. The origi-nal medium (1945) contained the following compounds: lactose, antifoam, 0.25%. Improved media resulting in higher penicillin yields have been developed. A typical composition of such media is: glucose ormolasses, 10%; corn steep vegetable oil-antifoam, 0.5% total. Corn steep liquor (CSL) is used as a nitrogen source, since it results in higher peni- cillin yields as compared to the other nitrogen sources. Some compounds in CSL are con-verted to phenylacetic acid or other side-chain precursors. Cottonseed flour or soybeanmeal may also be used as nitrogen sources; however, they are more expensive than CSL.Continuous addition of ammonium sulfate to keep the ammonium concentration around250-300 mg/l is required for continued synthesis of penicillin and to avoid lysis of themycelium. Certain precursors of the penicillin side chain need to be added into the fermenta- tion medium. This constitutes a major cost item. Penicillin G requires 0.47 g sodiumphenylacetate and penicillin V 0.5 g sodium phenoxyacetate per gram of penicillin pro-duced. Those precursors are fed continuously to avoid possible toxic effects. More than90% of the precursors are incorporated into the structure of penicillin. Phosphorus sup-plied by CSL is usually sufficient, since phosphate concentration should be limiting(200-300 mg/l) in the media for penicillin production. Penicillin is a secondary metabolite with a nongrowth-associated production. The process to produce penicillin involves an initial batch phase in which cell growth occurs. In 528 Traditional Industrial Bioprocesses Appendix Figure A.4. Chemical structure of penicillins G and V .appx 10/11/01 7:37 PM Page 528the first 40 h of fermentation rapid cell growth is achieved with a doubling time of nearly 6 h. After a high cell density has been obtained, nutrients (glucose and CSL) and precursors areadded slowly or intermittently to reduce cell growth to 0.02 h -1and maximize penicillin pro- duction. Oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate concentrations should be low. A simpli-fied diagram of the process scheme is presented in Fig. 1.3. Culture preparation starts withlyophilized spores and agar slant cultures. Vegetative cells are cultivated in shake flasks andthen are transferred to seed fermenters (10-100 l). Production fermenters are agitated tanks200-500 m 3in volume made of stainless steel. Mechanical agitation is provided at a rate of 100 to 300 rpm. Temperature is controlled around 25-28\u00b0C (26\u00b0C optimum) by using cool-ing coils. Antifoam is added to reduce foam formation. Dissolved oxygen is controlled at >2 mg/l and pH at 6.5. Vigorous aeration is supplied from the bottom of fermenters by ring or tube spargers. Due to the high viscosity of the broth, oxygen transfer is a major problemin penicillin fermentations. In some cases, strains from pellets are preferred because themedium is less viscous and oxygen supply is improved. The fermentation is stopped whenthe oxygen uptake rate of the culture exceeds the oxygen transfer rate of the reactor, or when80% of the fermenter is full. The original process for the recovery of penicillin from fermentation broth was based on adsorption on activated carbon. After washing with water, the activated carbonwas eluted with 80% acetone. The penicillin was concentrated by evaporation under vac-uum at 20 to 30\u00b0C. The remaining aqueous solution was cooled to 2\u00b0C, acidified to pH = 2-3, and the penicillin extracted with amyl acetate. Penicillin was crystallized fromamyl acetate with excess mineral salts at pH of 7 under vacuum. This process is uneco-nomical because of the high cost of activated carbon. The current recovery process includes filtration, extraction, adsorption, crystalliza- tion, and drying. Filtration is usually achieved by using high-capacity, rotary vacuumdrum filters for separation of the mycelia. The mycelia are washed on the filter and dis-posed. The penicillin-rich filtrate is cooled to 2-4\u00baC to avoid chemical or enzymaticdegradation of the penicillin. In some early processes, the filtrate was further clarified bya second filtration with the addition of alum. In recent years, macroporous filters havebeen used in some plants for separation of the mycelia. Solvent extraction is accomplished at low pH such as 2.5-3, using amyl acetate or butyl acetate as multistage centrifugal extractors (Pod-bielniak D-36 or Alfa-Laval ABE 216) are used for this purpose. The distribution coefficientof penicillin G or V between organic and aqueous phase depends strongly on the pH of themedium. At a pH of 3 the distribution coefficient is about 20. Penicillins G and V degradeunder acidic conditions with a first-order kinetics. To avoid degradation of penicillin duringsolvent extraction at low pH, temperature is kept around 2-4\u00b0C and filtration time is keptvery short (1-2 min). Two extractors used in series result in nearly 99% penicillin recovery.Whole broth extraction (without filtration) is possible by using Podbielniak extractors in se-ries. Due to operational difficulties, however, this approach is not used in practice. Carbonadsorption is used to remove impurities and pigments from penicillin-rich solvent after ex-traction. Several activated carbon columns in series can be used for this purpose. Penicillin may be back extracted into water by addition of alkali (KOH or NaOH) or buffer at pH of 5 to 7.5. The water-to-solvent ratio in this extraction is usually between 0.1and 0.2. A continuous, multistage, countercurrent extractor may be used for this purpose.This step is usually omitted in the new separation schemes. Sec. A.2 Aerobic Processes 529appx 10/11/01 7:37 PM Page 529Crystallization may be performed from the solvent or aqueous phase. Na, K, and penicillin concentrations, pH, and temperature need to be adjusted for crystallization. Ex-cess amounts of Na or K are added to the penicillin-rich solvent before crystallization inan agitated vessel. The crystals are separated by a rotary vacuum filter. The crystals maybe washed and predried with anhydrous butyl alcohol to remove some impurities. Largehorizontal belt filters are used for collection and drying of the crystals. Usually warm airor radiant heat is used for drying. Crystalline penicillins G or V are sold as an intermediate or converted to 6-APA (6-aminopenicillanic acid), which is used for production of semisynthetic penicillins. Theenzyme penicillin acylase is used for cleavage of penicillin G or V to produce 6-APA.Some bacteria, E. coli, B. megaterum, and P . melanogenum, as well as some molds pro- duce the enzyme. Production costs for penicillin production utilizing glucose as a substrate were cal- culated in 1982 as $19/kg. Prices of penicillin have decreased in recent years, from$31.73/kg in 1996 to $15/kg in 2000. This has put pressure on penicillin manufacturers toreduce production costs. The most important costs in penicillin production are raw materi-als (35%) and utilities (14%). By using cheaper raw materials, as molasses or starch, andgenetically improved strains producing higher penicillin yields, the production costs maybe reduced significantly. Worldwide, approximately 26,000 tons of penicillin G and 10,000 of penicillin V are produced annually. Penicillins for medical applications and feed have an annual de-mand of $4,400 million. More than 80% of the penicillin produced is utilized for the syn-thesis of 6-APA and other intermediates. A.2.4. Production of High-Fructose Syrup (HFCS) High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a low-calorie sweetener commonly used in bever- ages, desserts, and other sweet foods. Until 1935, the only syrup available was 42 DE(dextrose equivalent) acid-converted corn syrup. In 1940, enzymes were commerciallyavailable and corn starch was hydrolyzed enzymatically to produce corn syrups. In theearly 1960s the first crystalline dextrose derived from corn was marketed. The commer-cial production of the enzyme glucose isomerase, which converts glucose to its sweeter(approx. 1.7 times) isomer fructose, was a major milestone. The first HFCS was producedin 1967 and contained 15% fructose. Further process improvements yielded 42% and 55%fructose-containing HFCS. The original conversion process was batch; however, immobi-lized enzyme technology was later used for the production of HFCS by continuous opera-tion. United States sales of HFCS exceeded 9.58 million tons in 1999. Three major HFCS products differ by their fructose content, 42%, 55%, and 90%. HFCS containing 42% fructose is mainly used in most of the food products utilizing liq-uid sweeteners. HFCS with higher levels of fructose (55%) are mainly used in soft drinksas a replacement for sucrose and in jams and jellies (90%) as a low-calorie sweetener. Production of HFCS from corn starch is an enzymatic process. The process scheme may be divided into 18 steps and five major operations (Fig. A.5). Those operations aredextrose production by enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch, primary physical and chemi-cal treatment of dextrose syrup, isomerization of dextrose 7:37 PM Page 530refining of of 42% fructose- to 55% fructose-contain- ing HFCS. First, corn starch is gelatinized by cooking at high temperatures such as 65\u00baC and is converted to dextrose (liquefaction) by thermostable-amylase in a two-stage continuousreactor. The product is a dextrose-rich syrup containing 10 to 15 DE. The conditions inliquefaction reactors are 105\u00b0C and a 5- to 10-min holding time for the first reactor; and95\u00b0C and a 90- to 120-min holding time for the second reactor. The feed starch slurry con-tains 30-35% solids with 0.1 to 10% enzyme at a pH of 6.5. The total and soluble proteincontents of the starch slurry should be lower than 0.3% and 0.03%, respectively, to avoidcolor formation as a result of the Maillard reaction between amino acids and sugars athigh temperatures. Saccharification of liquefied starch slurry is achieved by using the Sec. A.2 Aerobic Processes 531 Figure A.5. glucoamylase to produce more dextrose from branched chains of the starch. In continuous saccharification reactors, glucoamylase is added to the 10-15 DE liquefiedstarch after temperature and pH adjustment and is fed through a number of reactors in se-ries. The conditions for this step are 60\u00b0C, pH of 4.3, and holding time of 65 to 75 h. Thefeed contains 30 to 35% dry substance and 1 l of glucoamylase solution per ton of dryweight of starch. The product of this step contains 94 to 96% dextrose, 2 to 3% maltose,1 to 2% higher saccharides, and 30 to 35% dry substance. Environmental conditions mustbe strictly controlled during liquefaction and saccharification to obtain the 94-96% dex-trose that is required to obtain 42% fructose HFCS. The dextrose syrup produced by the liquefaction and saccharification step is refined to remove ash, metal ions, and proteins that may interfere with isomerization. The dex-trose syrup is filtered on rotary precoat vacuum filters to remove solids, proteins, and oil.The filtered liquor is then passed through several check and polish filters to remove tracesof particles. The color in the filtrate is removed by granular activated carbon in columns.Carbon-treated liquor is filtered again and passed through ion-exchange columns to re-move metal ions and ash. These columns are dual-pass cation-anion sys-tems that also remove syrup is evaporated toconcentrate dextrose, and Mg ions are added to activate the isomerase. Conversion of glucose (dextrose) to fructose by the enzyme glucose isomerize is ac- complished in a packed column of immobilized enzyme. The reactor conditions are55-65\u00b0C, pH of 7.5 to 8, and residence time of 0.5 to 4 h. The optimum temperature is60\u00b0C. Temperatures higher than 60\u00b0C cause higher conversion rates and faster inactivationof the enzyme. The feed temperature may be as low as 55\u00b0C, resulting in slower conver-sion and enzyme inactivation rates. Microbial contamination may be a problem at temper-atures below 55\u00b0C. The optimum pH for maximum enzyme activity is 8 and for stability isbetween 7 and 7.5. Therefore, the operating pH is adjusted for maximum stability and ac-tivity of the enzyme. The feed syrup contains 40 to 45% dry substance, 94-96% dextrose,4-6% higher saccharides, and Mg activator. The enzymatic isomerization of glucose to fructose is reversible. With 96% dextrose in the feed, the equilibrium fruc-tose concentration in the effluent is expected to be 48%. However, the exact equilibrium isnot reached with 4 h of residence time, and the effluent contains 42% fructose. The activity of the immobilized enzyme in the column drops exponentially with time. The half-life of the enzyme is 70 to 120 days. Therefore, the residence time for max-imum conversion is low for new columns with unused enzymes, and the feed flow rateshould be lowered at later stages of operation to obtain 42% fructose. Usually series andparallel configurations of immobilized enzyme columns are used to compensate for activ-ity loss of the enzyme. Parallel operation of six columns offers a good flexibility and re-sults in good product quality. A number of process variables such as temperature, feed pH,and flow rate may be varied to obtain uniform product quality. Constant fructose levelsare usually achieved by automatic back blending controlled by a polarimeter. Columnsmust be replaced two or three times a year. The cost of the enzyme is a major part of theoperating cost. By improving the stability and activity of the enzyme, the cost of isomer-ization may be reduced significantly. HFCS produced by isomerization of dextrose syrup can be further refined to remove color and ions by carbon treatment and ion exchange, respectively. The refined 42%HFCS is evaporated for shipment to yield 71% solids. 532 Industrial Bioprocesses 42%syrup needs to be concentrated. Fructose preferentially forms a complex with somecations such as calcium. This is used for concentrating fructose in HFCS. There are twodifferent commercial processes for enrichment of fructose from 42% syrup. One processutilizes an inorganic resin molecular adsorption of fructose. Another processemploys fractionation using columns but dextrose is not. and deoxygenated water is usedfor the elution of fructose from the column. Usually a column packed with low cross-linked fine-mesh polystyrene sulfonate-Ca cation exchange resin is used for enrichmentpurpose. The enriched syrup contains nearly 90% fructose and is called very enrichedfructose corn syrup (VEFCS). The VEFCS is blended with 42%-fructose syrup to obtainthe desired fructose content, such as 55%. The effluent from the isomerization step maybe recycled back to the feed solution to obtain 42%-fructose syrup in the effluent of theisomerization column. The raffinate stream rich in oligosaccharides is recycled back tothe saccharification step. The water used as an eluent in enrichment columns should beminimized to maximize the solids content of the syrup. Since 1972 HFCS has replaced sucrose as a low-calorie sweetener to a large extent. The price of sucrose was 31 cents/lb and the price of HFCS was 21 cents/lb, about 70% ofthe sucrose price in 1981. This difference has become larger with the recent developmentsin HFCS production technology. Consequently, HFCS has replaced sucrose and glucoseas a low-calorie sweetener used in soft drinks, canned fruits, ice cream, and certain bakeryproducts over the last twenty years. Low-calorie sweetener consumption is expected tolevel off at 130 lb per capita per year.
