Parents' excitement and miraculous belief when their child walks, even though \"everyone said they would never walk,\" motivates me. I love the challenge of figuring out ways to study, measure and improve physical activity and life participation for kids with physical limitations. I strive to support these kids to \"do what they want to do when they want to do it\" and have full and meaningful lives.\" - Kristie Bjornson, PT, PhD, PCS is a Pediatric Physical Therapist with over 40 years of clinical experience in settings such as the NICU, public schools, birth-to-three centers, home-based private practice, joint orthotic management with orthotists and at Seattle Children's Hospital (SCH) in Seattle, Washington. Dr. Bjornson is currently a professor in Developmental Medicine, Pediatrics at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute. Dr. Bjornson was the project coordinator for the randomized clinical trial and meta-analysis of selective dorsal rhizotomy, botulinum toxin-A and a descriptive cross sectional study of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy. Bjornson's doctoral work focused on the assessment of physical activity, health and quality of life in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy and normative ambulatory data for the StepWatch accelerometer. In 2008, she was awarded the Section on Pediatrics, APTA dissertation award along with the best manuscript published by a student in the Pediatric Physical Therapy Journal Jeanne Hughes award in 2009. Presently, Dr. Bjornson is exploring training interventions and orthotic management to optimize walking in children with cerebral palsy. Specifically these protocols examine the use of treadmill training, strength/power training and the ankle foot orthoses footwear combination (AFO-FC) orthotic management approach. A member of the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM), Ms. Bjornson has served on the Membership, Research, Adaptive Sports and Recreation Committees, served on the Board of Directors, been the Annual meeting Scientific Program Chair as well as secretary on the AACPDM Board of Directors. She has been an item writer for the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) Pediatric Board Certification exam and has participated on the APTA Section on Pediatrics program and research committees. - Related Pages - The Bjornson laboratory's research aims to improve the lives of children with cerebral palsy. We focus on gathering objective data around interventions in orthotics, gait training and power training that can dramatically enhance children's balance, muscle strength, walking and general mobility in daily life. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date Stephen M.
