GERD is the backward flow of stomach acid into the esophagus, which causes a sour taste and a burning sensation in the throat. Screening and prevention are important aspects of care because individuals with Barrett's are at a significantly higher risk of developing esophageal cancer.

These cells can grow slowly into a tumor over the course of many years. Many symptoms of gastric cancer are easily ignored since they cause only modest discomfort. That is why gastric cancer often advances before being detected.
