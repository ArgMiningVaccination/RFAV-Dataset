The definition of Tao is (in Chinese philosophy) the absolute principle underlying the universe, combining within itself the principles of yin and yang and signifying the way, or code of behavior, that is in harmony with the natural order. The interpretation of Tao in the Tao-Te-Ching developed into the philosophical religion of Taoism. Health is defined as the state of being free from illness or injury and Healing is the process of making or becoming sound or healthy again. Thus, the name; Tao of Health and Healing. What Is Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda? Traditional Chinese Medicine is not a \"disease\" based medicine like Western medicine but is a \"pattern\" based medicine. It is based on the theory that pain and illness result when imbalances occur in the bodies energy flow. These imbalances are explored through the use of specific diagnostic skills. The practitioner then makes a diagnosis or \"pattern discrimination\". Once these patterns or \"imbalances\" are identified, the practitioner will treat the patient according to their specific pattern imbalances by choosing from a myriad of different therapies, to help bring the patients energy flow back into balance, thus helping the patient's physiology to self-correct. The most widely used therapy in Traditional Chinese Medicine is Chinese Herbal Medicine. Chinese Herbal Medicine uses formulas of approximately 6-18 single herbs in combination which are made specific for the patient's patterns. Because the formulas are made specific to the individual, the patient should have virtually no side effects. If discomfort should occur, the formulas will be modified until the patient is free from discomfort. The most common Traditional Chinese Medical Therapy known in the West is Acupuncture. This is the insertion of fine needles, which cause little or no discomfort, into specific points on the body to rebalance the bodies energy flow, thereby allowing the body to self-correct, or heal. Other therapies can be used with, or in place of acupuncture, as they may be a better choice in achieving the desired results. These therapies include, but are not limited to; magnets, moxibustion (herbal heat techniques), acupressure, heat therapies, cupping, liniments, plasters, dietary therapy, life-style counseling and \"needless\" acupuncture therapies such as magnets, cups or other desired therapies. What Is Ayurvedic Medicine? Ayurvedic medicine is one of the world's oldest holistic healing systems. It's based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the Body/Mind and Spirit through the use of three doshas. These doshas are, Vata dosha water); and Kapha dosha (water and earth). Every individual is a unique mix of the three doshas. Often one dosha is usually stronger than the others and each one controls a different body function. The balance of all three doshas helps to maintain harmony on all levels of being and keep immunity strong. Its main goal is to promote good health, not fight disease. But treatments can also be geared toward specific health problems. Just like in Traditional Chinese Medicine, an Ayurvedic practitioner will create a treatment plan specifically designed for the individual based on their doshas to reduce their symptoms and restore harmony and balance. This can be done with herbs, food therapy(eating according to the doshas), lifestyle counseling, marma therapy, medical oils, abhyanga massage, shirodhara and sometimes with a cleansing process called \"panchakarma\". Some of the techniques that an Ayurvedic practitioner might use for panchakarma is blood purification, massage, medical oils, herbs, and enemas or laxatives. "}
