The dean, program d irector, faculty and s taff are delighted to meet you. We are committed to providing learning experiences that will help you excel in your chosen profession. Market analysts are reporting that the field of physical therapy is growing rapidly and that demand for PTs and PTAs will con tinue to increase in anticipation of the high number of baby boomers who are aging: many are retiring from the field, and, as a demographic group, they will potentially create increased demand for physical therapy services. Our office frequently receives calls and emails from facilities that want to hire LLU PTAs. Announcements for job openings sent by email to our office are forwarded to all recent alumni via their LLU email address es for several years after graduation and are posted regularly on https://lluhconnect.org/ In order to receive the PTA degree, students must s atisfactorily complete the entire program, including clinical experiences. Occasionally, a student may drop out of the program for personal reasons, and unfortunately , some leave due to academic disqualification. When this happens, the student may re -apply for the next year, and if accepted, may complete the program w ith the next class. The graduation rate over the past four years is 84 %. Program instructors will do all they can to assist student in the program, but ultimately, each student is responsible f or their own grades.

One of our primary goals is to prepare students to perform successfully on this exam. We have observed that student s tend to perform well on the exam if they perform well in this program. In addition, the program provides access to exam prep resources at the end of spring quar ter to help prepare students for the national exam . Completion of the PTA program and passing the PTA National Exam do not automatically make on e eligible to become licensed an d/or practice as a PTA in other countries. Each student is responsible for determining the regulations that govern PTA licensing in the state, country or region in which they seek employment.

The expected program completion is typically near the end of September. To complete the physical therapist assistant AS degree program, a student must pass all courses in the curri culum with at least a \"C\" grade (therefore maintaining a minimum GPA of 2.0 in the didactic portion of the program ), and receive a satisfactory grade for all cl inical experiences and any other Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory courses.

Year at a Glance See Appendix for an outline of the curriculum for the current year.21 Class Officers Near th e end of the first summer quarter, the students will elect class officers who help organize class activities and represent the class members at faculty meetings. Class officers need to be mature individuals who can well represent the members of the class and serve as leaders.

A letter of instruction is sent to each student's LLU email address prior to the end of every quarter ; each student is responsible for following those instructions. If problems do occur, students may contact the program office for assistance. Each stude nt must obtain \"Financial Clearance\" to validate registration every quarter. If lender funding is expected, the student must communicate with the finance office for actual acceptance of the funds expected. Until the student formally accepts the funding, it will not be credited to the student's account, and the student has not \"cleared finance\" and has not completed registration. In order to receive credit for a specific class, a student must register and clear finance by the final deadline for adding class es. Students may not attend any class or lab for which they are not registered . A late registration will automatically engender a late fee of $200. Registration Holds may be lifted by request for the first summer quarter if official transcripts have not yet arrived at the University Student Records office for spring term of the same year. However, they will NOT be allowed to register for fall quarter unless all official transcripts are in. It is the student's responsibility to ensure transcripts have been received by checking their registration portal or by contacting University Records. Registration schedules, deadlines and more information on registration may be found at www.llu.edu/ssweb/registr ation.html . Adding or Dropping Class es Students may change their schedule by completing a Change Request form available on the web, under the heading \"Forms.\" The last day to add a course i s five days after the beginning of instruction. The last day to d rop a course without record of the transcript is ten school days after the beginning of instruction of any quarter. A \"W\" (withdrawn status) will be recorded on the transcript for courses dropped prior to 14 calendar days before the final examination week. Courses may not be withdrawn after that date. Dropping a course will jeopardize the student's ability to graduate with the same class, as courses are only taught once per year. Accommodations Any individual with a disability, who needs re asonable accomm odations to fully participate in this program, must submit a request to the SAHP Assistant Dean of Student Affairs, Dr. Chuck Dart, using the Student Information and Requested Accommodation form . This form is available in Dr. Dart's office in Cottage 60 which is located on the lawn immediately east of Nichol Hall. Accom modations granted for the didactic/classroom portion of the curriculum do not automatically extend to the clinical education experiences. A new request must be submitted and approved for r easonable accommodations in any clinical setting . Although the faculty will be notified of students who have been granted accommodations, it is the student' s responsibility to speak with each instructor each quarter and show the instructor a copy of the accommodations granted and discuss which, if any, of the accommodations may be necessary for each course . Thus it is important for the student to meet with each instructor to determine which granted accommodations wo uld be appropriate. Required Text Books Each student must obtain a copy of the required textbooks listed in the course syllabi within the first two weeks of the quarter. Required textbooks in stock at the Campus Store which are not purchased within two we eks will be 24 returned by the Store to the publisher. It will then become the student's responsibility to obtain the textbook on their own. Attendance Class : Punctual a ttendance is required . Tardiness is not acceptable and shows disrespect for the instructo r and students. Regula r attendance is required beginning the first day of every term for all appointments including course lectures, labs and field trips; any s pecial assignment s from instructors; all assigned clinical experiences; Wednesday Chapel s and TB A's. In classrooms, once the class has begun and the door has been shut, students may not enter until the next break time . This will ensure that on -time students are not disturbed by those who are late. Excessive absence may be cause for a reduction of the final course letter grade. Absences from laboratory assignments or classes are not excused except in cases of emergency in which case the PTA office must be notified. Pagers and cell phones must be on silent or vibrate during class time. Examinations : All exams must be taken as scheduled. If a situation arises that a student believes will necessitate taking an examination at a different time t han scheduled, they may request permission in advance and in writing using the appropriate form available in the PTA Office, Request for Special Examination . All requests are reviewed by the faculty; if the request is granted, a $50 fee is required for each rescheduled exam. Absences : The program office must be informed of any absence so that the instructor may be notified , if possible , prior to the class period , or as soon as possible thereafter (909 -558-4634). Failure to notify the office or instructor will likely result in an unexcused absence which may jeopardize the student's grade. However notification, while required, does not necessarily excuse the absence. It is the responsibility of the student to obtain any information that was given in his/her absence. If an examination is missed, the student must contact the instructor within 48 hours. Time does not permit the routine administration of \"make -up\" examinations or quizzes. Such exams will be given only because of documented illness, or at the discretion of the faculty. TBA: To Be Arranged Certain blocks of time in the schedule are labeled \"To Be Arranged (TBA).\" This time period may be used by instructors for examinations, guest lectures, or clinical education or ientation. Most TBA times are utilized and you need to plan to be in class during that time. Do not make other appointments during this time . The TBA schedules are posted i n the PTA of fice: Students must check at least once per week for updates. Clinical Education Clinical Education generally refers to training completed in a full -time clinical en vironment including in-patient settings (acute and sub -acute hospitals and medical centers, rehabilitation centers, skilled nursing facilities), and out-patient settings (private practice, pediatric, geriatric, rehabilitation, wellness centers, sports medicine , etc ). The Year -at-a-Glance schedule reveals how the didactic segments are integrated with t hree six-week clinical experiences for a total of 18 weeks . Completion of the full 18 weeks (5 days/week ) is required for program completion. See t he LLU PTA Clinical Education Handbook for details regarding emergencies affecting completion. Each student is responsible for their own transportation to clinical sites . In most cases, this will require a car. Note that the first full-time clinical cours e (PTAS 293) comes in the first six weeks of spring quarter. PTA students are covered by health and liability (malpractice) insurance provided by the University during clin ical education experiences. Prior to engaging in clinical education courses, the student must demonstrate they are competent 25 and safe by successful completion of ALL curricular didactic courses scheduled prior to clinical courses which includes successful completion of laboratory pra ctical exams in the PTAS courses. These include specific data collection skills and intervention skills involving the major systems (cardiovascular, pulmonary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular ). For more details, see the Compreh ensive Ski lls Master List in the appendix. All full-time clinical experiences will be arranged by our director of clinical e ducation (DCE), Jennifer Rae Rubio , who is responsible for the assignment and supervision of the full -time clinical experiences . Occasionally , other PTA faculty memb ers assist with monitoring the clinical experiences with midterm visits or phone calls to clinical instructors and students. The Dep artment of Physical Therapy maintains approximately 900 active affiliation agreements with clinical facilities ac ross the country. A ssignments will be drawn primarily from this set; the development of new agreements is both expensive and time consuming. Requests for new sites will be considered only after active resources have been exhaust ed. Such requests must be submitted at least six months to nine months in advance to allow for completion of extensive legal work for each contract. Because of the limited number of local clinical slots, assignments cannot be made on the basis of the stu dent's family situation, marital status or personal preference. Although the program makes every effort to accommodate the student's preference, the student agrees to accept the clinical assignments made by the program at any affiliated facility, whether l ocal or out of state. Competition among professional schools for access to clinical education sites in California is keen. Our program cooperate s with the Intercollegiate Academic Clinical Coordinators Council , a consortium of DCEs from other PT and PTA programs in southern California. One of the objectives of IACCC is to facilitate communication betwe en the academic programs and clinical sites shared by consortium members, particularly with regards to clinical experiences . Thus, we have the most effectiv e means for securing clinical rotations in competitive sites , but we are also limited by the needs of other programs. If the student has not reached entry -level competency at the end of the scheduled clinical experiences, an additional six -week clini cal course may be arranged. Onl y one such additional clinical course is allowed. Most problems in the clinical setting are remediated early in the rotation. If you are having problems in the clinic, contact Jennifer Rae Rubio immediately. Students will no t be asked to continue working in a clinical site that is found to be out of compliance with state/federal laws and regulations, or where the student feels they are placed in jeopardy. Jennifer Rae Rubio (DCE) will meet regularly with the PTA class for orientation to clinical education throughout the year . Students may submit requests for specific sites to the DCE for consideration through a designated process; however, a request does not entitle one to the clinical assignment. Please note : Students are prohibited from contacting clinical instructors or staff at clinical sites to request clinical rotation s. Sever e consequences may result for the student who attempts to make such contact . All requests made directly to any clinical s ites must be submitted only by the DCE. Clinical Facility Requirements Proof of current certification in Cardio -Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) from the American Heart Association is required for participation in Clinical Experiences I, II, and III ; in addi tion, a variety of site -specific requirements must be completed . Some clinical facilities require a new TB test just before starting the affiliation in addition to the TB test required for initial LLU enrollment; some sites require an interview prior to placement; others may require an additional criminal background check, and/or drug testing. Students will be asked to sign a release form for required health information to be sent to the clinical facilities. The d irector of clinical education will discuss all of these th ings in greater detail during the scheduled C linical Education orientation sessions. Due to the number of 26 students across campus involved in clinical rotations, LLU policy mandates flu vaccination of all students in fall quarter . A registration hold will be imposed for w inter quarter until completed. Lastly, some clinical sites may require vaccination against COVID -19. This may result in difficulty obtaining certain placements for students who are not vaccinated and may delay completion of the program. Lastly, all students must have positive titers for: Hepatitis B, Chicken Pox (Varicella Zoster virus), and Measles, Mumps, Rubella before the y start Fall Quarter . Students must be able to show th ey've made steps toward this end prior to starting the PTA Program. Professional Development Students in the Loma Linda University Physical Therapist Assistant program are expected to demonstrate attributes, characteristics and behaviors that are not explicitly part of the professional core of knowledge and technical skills but are nevertheless required for success in the profession. The faculty and instructors are committed to assist ing students in developing and refining expected beha viors . Students will be evaluated based on expectations for professional behaviors in the classroom, in labs and in clinical settings. Several documents will be used when defining professional behaviors: 1. Core Values of Loma Linda University ; http://llucatalog.llu.edu/about -university/core -values -loma -linda - university/ See Page 6 of this PTA Student Handbook for de finition s of these values. 2. American Physical Therapy Association Standards of Ethic al Conduct for the P hysical Therapist Assistant ; http://www.apta.org/uploadedFiles/APTAorg/About_Us/Policies/Ethics/StandardsEthicalConductPTA.pdf 3. American Physical Therapy Association , Core Values for the Physical Therapist and Physical Therapist Assistant ; e xpectations for professional behavior s are introduced and reinforced by instructors throug hout the curriculum to help students identify with and integrate these behaviors while in the program a nd before the onset of the fulltime clinical experiences. Student s will be given periodic opportunities to evaluate themselves regarding their developmental level toward re aching these expectations. Program and clinical faculty may also evaluate students regarding these expectations. The following actions will be taken if a student demonstrates behavior inconsistent with the criteria established in the identified document s. 1. When behavior is perceived as being inappropriate, the student will be given feedback regarding the behavior and will be provided with relevant expectations for remediation. This feedback may be provided by faculty, instructors, and/or clinical edu cators. The student will be expected to remediate the behavior as advised. In the academic setting, feedback may take the form of a Professional Development Card (see Appendix One, Page 57) which may be handed to the student at the time inappropriate behavior has been observed by faculty/instructor. Upon receipt of a card, the student may record any extenuating circumstances on the card , and must sign the card and return it to the person wh o issued the card by the end of the same class period or lab, if not immediately. In some situations, the faculty member/instructor may choose to send an email to the student notifying them that a Professional Development Card has been placed in their s chool mailbox and that the student's response is required by the end of the following school day. In this case, the student may return their completed card to the program office. 27 An accumulation of one or more cards, depending on the situation, may requ ire the student to appear before a faculty committee for prof essional development review. Three cards will automatically trigger an appearance before the faculty committee. 2. In either an academic or a clinical setting, if a change to more appropriate behavior does not occur as a result of the feedback system, the faculty will determine consequences for the student which may include remediation of the unprofessional behavior or dismissal from the program. Laboratory Behavior Expectations Many PTA courses include a laboratory component where interventions and patient -handling skills will be demonstrated and practiced. The following specific expectations related to conduct while using the lab rooms are posted in each room. While in the labor atory, the PTA student will: 1. Behave in a professional and responsible manner when using the lab oratory . 2. Be prepared to dress for all labs according to the guidelines of the course instructor. 3. Refrain from any inappropriate remarks regarding other's app earance in lab attire. 4. Refrain from touch ing fellow students, apart from the professional manner required for practicing skills. 5. Keep equipment surfaces free of all personal items, such as bags, books, coats, towels etc. 6. Place all soiled linen in the lin en hamper. 7. Always use pillows that are enclosed in a pillow case. 8. Return clean , unused linens to the linen closet. 9. Place all trash in the trash receptacle. 10. Take all personal belongings when leaving the lab. Items left in the lab will be place in \"Lost and Found.\" If not claimed , they will be recycled or discarded. 11. Return all furniture and equipment to their correct positions. 12. To ensure safety , always have at least two persons present whenever studying or practicing in the lab . 13. To ensure safety, refrain from using any lab equipment that they ha ve not been fully trained to use by the course/lab instructors. 14. Obtain permission of the course instructor before using any electrical lab equipment to practice skills; the instructor must be present throughout the time students are using electrical lab equipment. (All electrical equipment is stored in a locked storage space separate from the lab rooms.) 15. Report any suspicious activity to Security - dial 911. Safety of Students When in the Role of Patient -Simulator in Lab Courses Laboratory skill-learning experiences include instruction and demonstration of interventional skills prior to practice by students who may alternate the role of patient -simulators with other students. To ensure safety, the student: instructor ratio is 14 :1 or lower for careful monitoring . Ana tomy Lab is closer to 5:1. Equipment is well -maintained according to program policies, and students are mandated to abide by the laboratory behavior expectations listed above. The Human Anatomy Dissection Lab PTA students enrolled in PTAS 201 Anatomy will need to take certain steps to obtain access to the LLU Swatek Anatomy Lab in the Centennial Complex after they complete registration for summer quarter and receive their 28 LLU ID badge. Students will receive an email with a link to instructions that must be followed and completed to obtain access to the Lab. The link may also be found on the Anatomy course Canvas page. Standards for Academic Conduct The purpose of Christian education is to integrate the highest intellectual, social, emotional, physical, and spiritual development of students while learni ng the knowledge and skills of the profession. In the classroom, students will be responsible to , and respectful of , their peers by avoiding any behavior that would disrupt the learning environment. Cheati ng is not tolerated. Cheating robs the student of an opportunity to learn and undermines relationships among peers, students and teachers. Where cheating is known, but not confronted, it ultimately allows a toleration of dishonesty that, if carried over in to professional practice, may result in abuse of patients and malpractice. For these reasons, cheating will not be tolerated and will be dealt with as a matter of serious discipline. Violations of ethical conduct encountered in educational programs in the health -related professions are of particular concern. Instructors and students are charged with the responsibility of reporting instances of such behavior to the program director. Substantiated violations will be brought before the faculty for disciplinary action. Such action may include, but is not limited to, academic probation or dismissal from the program . The following examples are illustrative but not intended to be a complete list of concerns. 1. Academic dishonesty Academic dishonesty involves a willful perversion of the truth in an academic setting. Examples include, but are not limited to: 1. Copying from peers, or knowingly and willingly permitting or assisting others to copy from you, or from examinations, assignme nts, or lab materials; 2. Using unauthorized aids for examinations, quizzes, assignments, clinical and laboratory procedures; 3. Looking at another individual's examination or quiz in a way that appears that information is being sought; 4. Plagiarizing, which inclu des the undocumented use of sources or ideas, whether quoted or paraphrased, or otherwise presented as one's own; 5. Fabrication and/or fraudulent insertion of scholarly materials, not the product of one's own efforts, into an assignment or clinical record; 6. Interfering in a harmful way with another's work (e.g. sabotaging laboratory work, or illicit entry or deletion of computer data); 7. Writing a test, or examination, or assignment for another student, or having another person wrongfully write an examination f or a third party; 8. Misrepresenting the attendance of self or of another party in a required class, laboratory or assembly; 9. Altering grades or arranging for others to wrongfully alter grades on tests or examinations, instructors' records, or recor ds of the s chool of University; 10. Handing in an assignment that has been done by another person, or copied from the internet or web, and indicating that it is your own original work. 2. Forgery Forgery consists of the falsifying of signatures, altering of the content of documents after they have been signed, and may include other forms of lying or intentional misrepresentation. Examples of forgery include but are not limited to: 1. Falsifying instr uctor's signatures on charts or evaluation forms; 29 2. Altering patient records, grade forms, evaluation sheets, or other documents after signing; 3. Signing another student's name on a classroom attendance record; 4. Forging a person's signature on clinic records. Grading System The program's grading system is designed to objectively measure the student's achievement of the stated student learning objectives for each course in a manner that encourages student cooperation rather than competition. In most lecture/lab c ourses, letter grades are assigned based on a percentage of maximum possible points in the course. In only a few didactic courses and in all clinical education courses, students rec eive either \"Satisfactory\" or \"Unsatisfactory\" grades. S/U grades do not co ntribute to the calculation of the grade point average. The following percentage ranges will be used by the Grade Review Committee when determining final grades: Percent Letter Grade 95-100 A C+ C 74 D 73 F Around the mid -point of the term, instructors distribute \"Unsatisfactory Scholarship Report\" forms to students who appear to be at risk of academic failure with cumulative scores below 75%. The reports identify the course and indicators of ac ademic risk (attendance, low lab scores, low exam scores, etc.). Each student who receives such a report is strongly advised to contact the course instructor immediately to discuss possible strategies to improve their grade prior to the end of the course. Course Failure and Remediation Anatomy as a \"Gate Keeper\" PTAS 201 Anatomy is a four -unit course that is considered a \"gatekeeper\" course; failure of this course results in dismissal for academic disqualification. If a student re -applies and is re -admitted, they must retake the class at full price. As a \"gate,\" the Anatomy cour se is e xempt from the policy allowing fo r academic failure of one course . A student who fails the Anatomy course will be permitted to continue the summer quarter courses that have already begun. However, summer courses that have n ot yet started will be d ropped from the stude nt's enrollment by the program director in conjunction with an online academic dismissal process . This allows the student to complete summer courses that are not yet graded. Course Failure after Passing Anatomy 30 There is a lim it to the number of courses that a student may fail before dismissal from the program. A student is not allowed to fail more than one course throughout the program , regardless of the units of the course, during the remainder of the program after PTA Anatomy (all of which must be remediated). A failure of more than one course result s in academic dismissal from the program regardless of remediation measures. Students in the program must receive a grade of C or better in all subjects to complet e the program. Grades of C -, D or F are considered failing grades in the PTA Program. If a student fails one course (and no more than one) the course may be remediated and the student may remain in the program according to the process below . Remediation The University policy for remediation of a failed didactic course offers the student two options: 1. Repeat the class the following year, paying full tuition. The grade earned in the course will be the grade the student receives. Students may not be en rolled in courses for which the failed class is pre -requisite, until the course has been completed satisfactorily. Thus, the student would need to withdraw, take a leave of absence and resume the program the following year. 2. The student must register for a specified course which is a tutorial version of the same course. The tutorial course must be completed during the subsequent quarter in addition to the normal PTA curricular courses for the quarter. The tutorial rate (50%) applies to repea ted units. The student reviews the course work under supervision of the instructor, and then takes a final examination. This exam can be taken no sooner than two weeks after the final exam of the failed course and no later than the Friday prior to exam week for the term. If the student passes the tutorial final exam, the resulting course grade will be \"C.\" However, the number of failed units remains on the student's record and is cumulative. The student must pass the final exam in the tutorial course to continue in the program. Consequences of failure of the final examination for the tutorial course are determined by faculty review of the student's performance regarding progression in the program. The student will face either 1) suspension from the program at the end of the current term and until the full course is offered the following year and can be repeated , or 2) disqualification from the program. If a student fails any PTAS course in winter term, they will not be allowed to progress to PTAS 293 PTA Clinical Experience I in spring term. The student is allowed to progress to the didactic courses in the normal PTA curriculum in spring term while rem ediating the failed course. Under th ese circumstance s, all didactic courses must be satisfactorily completed prior to progression to any fulltime clinical experience . The three fulltime clinical experience s would be postponed and rescheduled pending satisfactory completion of all didactic courses. Dismissal for Non -Academic Reasons A student may be dismissed from the program for reasons other than low academic performance, such as cheating, harassment, theft, unet hical behaviors or other activities that do not uphold the University standards. A partial list of such activities is listed in the Student Handbook. The list includes, but is not limited to, using or being in possession of firearms, alcohol, tobacco, drug s or other controlled substances . Re-Admission Policy Re-Admission Following Scholastic Disqualification If a student who is dismissed from the program wishes to re -apply to the program for the following year, that student must: 31 1. Re -apply online f or admission to the program and pay a re -application fee. 2. Write a letter to the program faculty committee describing what steps have been taken to overcome the problems that may have contributed to the academic dismissal. The committee will evaluate the student's request and may grant re -admission to the program if the evidence submitted is sufficient to predict that the student could be successful in the program on a second admission. If a student is re -admitted into th e program for the following year, the student may choose either of two options : OPTION #1: The student would enter as a \"new\" student and retake ALL PTAS courses, regardless of the grade earned on the first admission. Scholastic disqualification point s from the first admission would be erased and would not carry over to the second admission. See Policy #27. OPTION #2: All PTAS courses with grades of C+ grades or below are repeated. Only the most recent grades are counted towards requirements for p rogram completion. In addition, any other requirements that the faculty determine are necessary must be completed. A maximum of ten units of repeat work will be charged at the reduced tutorial rate (50% of current tuition). Failure of any course during readmission under Option #2 will result in permanent dismissal from the program. Non -PTAS C ourses on Re -Admission The student who returns on a second admission following academic dismissal does not need to repeat any courses in the program that do not carry the \"PTAS\" prefix if the course was completed with a \"C\" grade or higher. Courses in this category would include: RELE 257 Health Care Ethics RELR 275 Intro to Art & Science of Whole Person Care AHCJ 305 Infectious Diseases and the Healthcare Provider Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the University. It subverts the mission of the University and threatens the careers, educational experiences and the well -being of studen ts, faculty, employees and patients. Other types of harassment are also not in keeping with the standards of the University and will not be tolerated. For complete details on this policy and related procedures, see page 72 -74 in the online LLU Student Hand book at http://www.llu.edu/assets/central/handbook/documents/student -handbook.pdf . Background Checks for Criminal Record Each new student is required by LLUH to comp lete an online Background Check (BGC) for initial enrollment as instructed on the New Student Registration Portal . An updated BGC may be required before completion of the program. All BGC hits are reviewed by the LLUH Office of General Counsel. The LLUH General Counsel's office may determine that, based on the BGC results, a student is not allowed to participate in clinical education experiences at any LLUH entities. In such cases, the program finds the student disqualified from the program and the stude nt is given administrative dismissal. Loma Linda University is not held liable if a graduate cannot obtain the license to practice in their chosen field. 32 Policy on Individual Rights and Safety Safety, the right to privacy, confidentiality and informed consent apply to any individual involved with the Physical Therapist Assistant Program, including, but not limited to students, faculty, staff, visitors to the program, human subject for classroom or laboratory demonstrations, and client s interacting with students at clinical facilities. Steps of the Complaint Procedure 1. Speak with the student, teacher or clinical instructor concerned and try to resolve the problem at that level; 2. If unresolved, speak with the director of the program; 3. The director will work with the parties involved to attempt dialogue and resolution of the problem. The problem may also be referred to faculty. This will be documented in a folder of complaints kept in the department; 4. If the director is unable to achieve a satisfactory resolution, the complaint goes to the Dean of the SAHP; 5. A final step would be to request a faculty review committee and begin a grievance process. Steps of the Grievance Process Any person with an unresolved complaint or concern a bout the PTA Program or one of its policies, programs, faculty, staff or students will be asked to submit their concern in writing. Persons with a verbal complaint/concern should be asked to submit their issues in w riting to the program director, departmen t chairperson or to the Dean of the School of Allied Health Professions. For the PTA program, if the nature of the concern falls into the possibility of a formal complaint to the program's accrediting body, contact the APTA's Department of Accreditation to discuss the nature of the complaint and to determine what procedures should be taken. This department can be reached by fax at (703) 684 -7343 or email at accreditation@apta.org . Use of Protected Information Information collected f rom students, lab subjects, and patients or clients is considered confidential information, and is protected by applicable Health and Human Services laws (available through : https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/ ). As such, the information can only be used for purposes other than direct health care, upon written informed consent from the patient/client or designated official. Use of the information s hould still protect the right to anonymity, when possible, and be used for educational purposes, either in the classroom or for other professionals. If images are requested, a separate consent form must be obtained prior to obtaining and using such images. Human Subjects Policies regarding patient/client rights within the clinical setting are established by the institution and should allow clients the right to refuse to participate in clinical education. Subjects used to demonstrate in the classroom setti ng are afforded the same right to informed consent as in other settings. Forms may be obtained from the administrative assistant, and completed forms should be placed in the course curriculum file. Personal safety Faculty, st aff and students should fo llow u niversal precautions, as identified by the Center for Disease Control, available at : https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/standard -precautions.html when ther e is the possibility of contact with any body fluid or potential contaminant. This policy is presented in another section of this PTA Student Handbook and PTA s tudents receive instruction in universal pr ecautions during their first quarter in the program i n the course PTAS 231 PT Modalities . (See also \" Safety\" in the next section of this H andbook) . Remember that Loma Linda University is committed to maintaining a smoke -, drug -, alcohol -, and harassment -free campus. Any student violating these policies is jeopardizing their student status. 33 The American Physical Therapy Association The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) is the professional organization that represents physical therapists and physical therapist assistants. All PTA students are required to maintain membership in the APTA while enrolled in the program (sign -ups will be done during new student orientation ). Members receive monthly physical th erapy journals by mail. Students are encourage d to read the journals and attend the local APTA - sponsored education meetings held monthly. The PTA program provides up to $1,000 per class to assist student attend ance at APTA sponsored meetings as follows : 1. The program will pay up to $500 for the elected APTA representative/s to attend APTA conventions with the following restriction: The program will pay for non -Saturday registration only. 2. The program will additionally pay up to $500 per class for student attendance at APTA conventions with the following restrictions: a. Program will pay a maximum of $100 per student for the convention; b. Program will pay for non -Saturday registration only; c. Stud ent must submit receipts for reimbursement. Expenses eligible for reimbursement are registration, lodging, transportation, and meals (per diem); d. Maximum meal allowance per day is set by the University; e. Maximum mileage allowance is set by the University. With class officers' approval, the APTA representative may receive money from both #1 and #2 for the same convention. With class officers' approval, an alternative representative in place of the elected APTA representatives may be appointed to attend a c onvention, and receive appropriate monetary support. Wholeness Incorporated Now The PTA program has a plan of action to incorporate \"WHOLENESS\" for each student while in the program. It is called the WIN program -Wholeness Incorporated Now . The students are encouraged to reflect on these four components of their lives and to nurture e ach component on a weekly basis. The areas include: Physical Emotional/Social Mental Spiritual During fall, winter and spring quarters, s tudents may submit weekly summaries of their activiti es through the Canvas portal for PTAS 265 Professional Seminar . At the end of each quarter, the number of weeks the student participated in each of these four areas is tallied. Participating student will receive extra credit of one -tenth of a percentage po int for each (up to a maximum of one percentage point per quarter ) which is added to t he final grade in each didactic course in the given quarter . For full details of this opportunity, see the \"Module 11 \" section of the PTAS 265 Professional Seminar cours e in the Canvas portal . 34 Student Identification Numbers Each student is given a personal LLU identification number, which will be used on Scantron exam an swer forms and other items when identification is needed in addition to the name. Th e program maintains confidentiality of all identification number s. Web Access to Personal Information and Grades Each student will be able to access the web to access test scores and course grades (via the online CANVAS course management system) and to discover the status of transcripts or registration \"holds\" or degree completion status . Please keep your Personal Identification Number (PIN) in a sa fe place for future refe rence to these sites . Video and Audio Recording Video -recording of any activities in any lecture or laboratory settings or other instructional environment by students is not permitted. Audio -recording of any activities in any lecture or laboratory setti ngs or other instructional environment by students may be permitted at the discretion of the course instructor. 35 Safety 36 Fire Safety Fire can be beautiful - but it can also be destructive. Risley Hall, one of our older university buildings, used to be one story taller than it is today. A fire did so much damage to the top floor that it had to be demolished. Other, smaller fire s have also taken place. Late one night, a fire occurred in a patient care unit in t he Medical Center. I t was extinguished by the sprinkler system and the damage was minimal, but the clean -up was extensive. The bottom line is that everyone needs to be constantly vigilant to prevent and/or stop fires. Prevention The best way to stop fir es is to keep them from getting started. The basic elements that are needed to create a fire are: Fuel - combustible materials Heat - to get the fuel burning (could be sparks) Oxygen - needed for all fires, and the more the merrier! We can prevent first by keeping these three elements separate. Do not allow fuel to accumulate, e.g. paper, sawdust, dirty linen and oily rags. Sources of heat and sparks should be identified and kept away from combustible materials. Heaters with open heating elements (e.g., glowing coils) are prohibited throughout all LLUAHSC facilities. Oxygen cannot be eliminated in very many places, but we can be careful in areas where there is or may be a higher concentration of oxygen. This includes the area around an oxygen tent, cyl inder, or oxygen medical gas wall outlet. It also includes the area where oxidizers are stored, like hydrogen peroxide and chlorine. Keep combustibles and sources of heat or sparks away from these substances. The Fire Response Plan Since prevention isn't always perfect, everyone needs to know what to do in case a fire does occur. Our basic fire response plan is called \"R.A.C.E.\" or \"the RACE Fire Plan.\" The four main steps you need to take if you find a fire are: RESCUE : Remove any one who is in immediate danger, including you. If people are unable to get out of the room on their own, like hospital patients, assist them if you can. If possible, get assistance and use a 2 or 3 person carry metho d. If you are by yourself, use a blanket to drag the patient from the room. And be sure to close the door behind you. ALARM : Turn on the alarm. Use the pull box, if your building has one, to get the Fire Department coming and to alert others in the building. Then, using a phone a safe distance from the fire, call 911 to report it to the Security Control Center. Be prepared to give them the specific information about the fire - location, size, number of people injured, etc. In addition to the Fire Department, an emergency response team will be sent, including Security officers, staff from engineering and housekeeping, and Respiratory Care technicians for patient care areas. CONTAIN : Close the rest of the doors in the area to keep the fire and smoke confined. If possible, tuck towels or sheets under the door and around the sides to help keep the smoke from spreading. EXTINGUISH : If you can do so without endangering yourself, fight the fire with an extinguisher. Use the ri ght extinguisher for the type of fire and follow the PASS plan to use it correctly. (See below for information on extinguishers.) 37 Evacuation Procedures Be prepared to evacuate when the fire alarm sounds. Because m any of your classes are held in Nichol Hall, you should know your emergency exit route. From Room 1609, exit via the fire escape at the front of the classroom. The PTA class members should meet south of Nichol Hall near the large tree on the lawn area. Wait there until your instructor has taken roll call, to check that everyone is accounted for . Thereafter, you will be instructed to either leave the premises or wait until the \"all -clear to return\" command has been given. Assist anybody who has a disability; do not use the elevator unless authori zed by Fire Department personnel. Remain outside until the Fire Department says it is safe to re -enter. Fire Extinguishers In order to fight a fire, it is helpful to understand the three classes of fire you would see in normal situations and the ty pes of extinguishers that are available: Classes of Fire Class A fires occur in combustible solids, like paper, linen, mattresses, and clothing. Water pu ts out Class A fires . Class B fires involve flammable liquids, like gasoline, alcohol, and some cleaning fluids. Using water on such fires would just spread the flaming liquid around. Class C fires involve electrical equipment, such as TV's, computers and beds with motor in them. Using water on this kind of equipment could get you electrocuted. Types of Fire Extinguishers Water - the tall, silver can with a hose contains water under pressure. Good for Class A fires only. Carbon dioxide (CO2) - the red extinguisher with the plastic horn contains CO2 under pressure. Good for Class B & C fires only. Dry chemical - generally red, may have a hos e or a short nozzle. Usually good for all three classes of fire (A, B, C). Also cal led multi -purpose extinguishers. This is the kind you will find in most locations. Halon - generally red with a yellow -green label. Primarily for electronic equipment, but good for Class B & C fires. If large enough, ca n also handle Class A fires. Usually found only where there is a lot of electronic equipment. To understand how to use a fire extinguisher, it helps to know the acronym PASS and what it stands for. When the first three steps of RACE have been taken care of, you are ready to attempt to exti nguish the fire - if you can do so without endangering yourself! I f the fire is too big, close the door and wait for the Fire Department. But, if the fire is still small, and if you have a clear exit from the fire in case it does get out of hand, grab the proper fire extinguisher from its cabinet or hook, and follow these steps: PULL the pin. Break the plastic tie that holds it in place by turning it like a key in a lock. Or give it a good, sharp yank. AIM at the base of the fire. Keep the extinguisher i tself upright, and point the hose or horn at the fire. If you're using a CO2 extinguisher, let go of the horn - it will stay where you aim it. SQUEEZE the handle. This activates the extinguisher. SWEEP from side to side, covering the whole fire area. Co ntinue sweeping motion until you are sure the fir e is completely out, or you run out of extinguishing material. If needed, several extinguishers can be used. Use RACE and PASS as described previously in this section and be ready to put them into action when needed. Evacuation Plan - Know where your relocation points are and how to evacuate yourself and others. Be ready to assist any visitors, disabled employees or students as needed. 38 Earthquake Southern California is prone to earthquakes of unpredicta ble force. The plan for earthquake safety is as follows: DUCK - Duck down beneath a desk or table. If beams fall from the roof, the table or desk should break their fall COVER - cover yourself by getting under a desk, and cover your head and neck by crouching in a fetal position HOLD - Hold onto the legs of the desk or chair as firmly as possible. You do not want them to slide away If the earthquake is small and no damage is done, class will resume once the shaking stops. If the earthquake is larger and the building is damaged, you must exit the building WHEN the shaking stops. Do not try to run out of the building as it is shaking. From Room 1609, exit qui ckly through the front fire exit door and proceed down the external stairs if they appear safe. If they are detached, walk down the 1600 H allway and through the ro tunda and out the front door. Close doors after you to prevent fire from spreading, if fire s hould break out. PTA students must make their way to their meeting place, which is the large tree at the back (south side) of the building. DO NOT RETURN INTO THE BUILDING TO REACH THE TREE ---go around the outside . Wait there in a group until your instr uctor has taken roll call. You will then be told that it i s clear for you to re -enter the building, or to leave the premises. It is important that you call if you are sick or absent, so that instructors will know of your absence. In an emergency situation such as an earthquake or fire, it is not a good idea for a teacher to be hunting for someone who was not present immediately prior to the event. Fire, earthquake or disaster drills will be held from time to time. Treat each alarm as if it is a disaster - it may be . DO NOT GO AWAY FROM THE TREE AREA until you have been accounted for and dismissed by your instructor . Hazardous Materials Safety Hazardous materials are things that can harm you if you are exposed to them. They can be chemical or biological ma terials in either solid , liquid or gas form. Hazardous materials are found in almost every work environment. Work areas like Housekeeping, Engineering, offices, laboratories, and even patient are as can have hazardous materials. Materials are classified by both the manufacturer and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as hazardous if they can burn easily, corrode or destroy living tissue or metals, cause cancer, react with other materials, or cause an infection or disease. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) regulates employees' use of , and exposure to , hazardous materials through our Hazard Communication program. This program give employees their right -to-know information through the two main sources of information: Labels and Ma terial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). Hazardous materials are required to be labeled appropriately by both OSHA and EPA. The label is your first warning that the material with which you are working is hazardous and why it is hazardous to you. Since there is o nly a small amount of space on a label, it will give a warning statement to tell you this information. If you see \"Warning,\" \"Caution,\" or \"Danger, \" it means that this material is potentially harmful to your health and safety. Hazardous material labels mus t include the name of the product, a list of ingredients, the name and address of the manufacturer and a warning statement. 39 Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are written by the manufacturer of the product to tell employees the specific hazards with usin g that product. The Office of Hazardous Materials Safety (OHMS) and your supervisor are your sources of MSDS. Types of information which can be found on a MSDS are: Hazardous Ingredients - a list of the hazardous components Physical and Chemical Characteristics - boing point, density, vapor pressure Fire and Explosion Hazards - flash point, firefighting procedures, flammable limits Reactivity - incompatible materials, stability, decomposition products Health Hazards, - routes of entry, signs and s ymptoms of exposure, emergency and first aid Precautions for Safe Handling - spill procedures, storage and handling precautions Control Measures - personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilation, safe work practices THE MSDS BOOK IS IN PROGRAM OFFICE on the top shelf opposite the copy machine. Hazardous materials that may be encountered during your training include: Rubbing alcohol, Clorox, Wex -cide solution, Matar germicidal detergent, Formalin, Betadine solution, and Cidex Hazardous Material Exposures : The best treatment for an exposure to a hazardous material is prevention. By reading the label and MSDS, practicing good housekeeping techniques, using the right Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and eliminating shortcuts, you can minimized your risk of exposure to the hazardous materials with which you work. Howeve r, if you or a co -worker is exposed, follow these steps to reduce injury. Consult the label and MSDS to identify the material. Decontaminate the affected body part (e.g., eyes, hands) wi th running water for a least 15 minutes. Report the incident to your supervisor immediately and fill out the right notification forms. Report (with your forms) to the Occupational Health Center or the Emergency Department for medical evaluation and follo w-up. Hazardous Material Spills : Again, prevention is the best way to avoid spilling a hazardous material (see the above section for preventive techniques). If a hazardous material has been spilled, follow these steps to minimize the risk of you and other s being exposed to it. Identify the material using the container label and MSDS. Confine or contain the spill. T ry to keep it from spreading. Evacuate affected areas in an emergency. For example, if the mater ial is giving off vapors and it i s difficult t o breathe. Use a spill kit for spills of mercury, blood and body fluids, or chemotherapy materials. Spill kits are available from Central Services. If this is a different type of hazardous material and not any of the material listed above, call the Security Control Center and have the officer page OHMS staff for clean -up. Don't try to clean it up yourself. Blood Borne Pathogens You have chosen to wor k in a Health Care Facility and it is important you understand how to protect yourself from blood borne pathogens. These pathogens need to get inside of your body to cause disease. They may enter your body and infect you through: 1. An accidental injury cause d by a sharp object that is contaminated by blood borne pathogens 2. Open cuts, nick, and abrasions 3. Mucous membranes of your mouth, eyes and nose Blood borne pathogens live in blood and other body fluids, such as saliva, semen and vaginal secretions. In spec ialized areas, like laboratories, blood borne pathogens may be in unfixed cells, tiss ue and organ cultures. While per forming your duties you may be at risk for exposure to the following blood borne pathogens: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). 40 Ordinarily, our healthy, unbroken skin is a barrier to blood borne disease. However, when you are scratched or struck by a bloody needle, lancet or other sharp object, your skin barrier is broken. Air does not ca rry blood borne pathogens; however, splashing or splattering them into your mucous membranes is a possibility for expos ure while per forming some procedures. It is in your best interest that you use the right barriers to minimize or eliminate your exposure to blood borne pathogens in your work setting. Hepatitis B Virus is a vaccine -preventable disease that is caused by a virus that attacks the liver. It can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (sca rring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and deat h. Symptoms can include jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain, loss of appetite, or occasional nausea and vomiting. About on e-half of those infected with HBV will recover and clear the infection. If you are stuck with a needle or sharp contaminated with H BV, you have a 6 to 30 percent chance of developing Hepatitis B. However, remember that all employees who may potentially be exposed to Hepatitis B on the job are offered a free vaccine that will protect them from Hepatitis B. Less common than Hepatiti s B is Hepatitis C. This, too, is an inflammation of the liver ; 85% of cases result in chronic liver disease. The symptoms are similar to Hepatitis B. Currently there is no vaccine for the prevention of Hepatitis C. There are newly approved antiviral dru gs that may be effective in treating some people who have Hepatitis C. Human Immunodeficiency Viruses, or HIV, causes AIDS. HIV causes a breakdown of the immune system and the clinical picture of HIV infections differs widely from person to person. Some persons remain apparently health for many years, while other become seriously ill, develop AIDS and eventually die. There is no preventive vaccine against HIV. If you are stuck with a HIV -contaminated sharp, your chances of becoming HIV positive are less t han \u00bd a percent. Seven ways to minimize your risk of exposure : 1. Get vaccinated against Hepatitis B before an injury occurs. 2. Engineering controls are designed to eliminate the exposure of hazard . Examples are needle -safe IV injection ports, needle -safe syringes, and needle -safe venipuncture devices, lancets with retractable blades, face shields or picket masks with a one -way value for mouth to mouth resuscitation and sharps disposal containers. 3. Work as if you and your co -worker's lives depend on it. Much of work practice controls are common sense. Listed below are several that should become your standard of practice: Place sharps in a container without recapping, bending or breaking the used needle Transport specim ens in close, lea -proof containers Do not eat and drink, apply cosmetics or handle contact lenses in areas where there is a chance of exposure to potentially infectious materials Store specimens away from food Handle contaminated patient equipment with car e and clean reusable equipment properly before using it on another patient 4. Wash your hands with soap and water for 10 -15 seconds whenever the following occur: Before you: After you: Prepare or eat food Blow your nose, cough or sneeze Insert or remov e contact lenses Use the bathroom Treat a cut or wound Handle garbage Tend to someone who is sick Tend to someone who is sick or injured In addition to the above, when in a patient care setting , wash your hands...... After removal of gloves After con tact with blood or body fluids Before performing invasive procedure 41 5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) helps guard your skin, eyes, mouth and personal clothing from exposure to Blood borne pathogens. Your department will provide PP that is effective f or your particular job. This may consist of gloves, goggles, face shields, gowns, lab coats, aprons, clinic jackets, and/or masks. 6. Good housekeeping is everyone's responsibility. General rules would include: Clean all blood and body fluid spills promptly Spill kits are available in your department or th rough Central Service . Each kit includes instructions, clean up equipment, disinfectant, and PPE necessary to protect you while cleaning up a spill Keep work surfaces and protective coverings clean Never use your hands or feet to compact trash or soiled linen Never pick up potentially contaminated broken glass with your hands 7. Biohazard labels and/or signs are affixed to containers/bags that store, transport, or are used to ship blood or potentially infectious body f luids. For more information on b lood borne pathogens, talk with your supervisor/department manager, or call LLUMC Hospital Epidemiology, ext. 66115. The risk of infection is real and should be taken seriously. Taking necessary precautions to prevent risks will protect you from blood borne infections. For more information on blood borne pathogens, talk with your supervisor/department manager, or call LLUMC Hospital Ep idemiology, ext. 66115. Exposure Monitoring Program A body fluid exposure can occur if there is an exchange of body fluids into mucus membranes or into skin that has been broken, torn or pierced. Examples of blood and body fluid exposures include: A puncture with a contaminated needle A cut or puncture with contaminated instru ments Transmission of blood or body fluids to mucous membranes, such as a splash to the eyes or mouth If you are exposed to blood or other body fluids, the procedure to follow is: Wash the wound(s) with soap and water or irrigate mucous membranes with w ater or saline Report the incident to your supervisor immediately Rill out two forms: Report of Accident/Illness (Form 20 -0032 -A) and Employee's Claim for Workers' Compensation Benefits (Form DWC -1) and have your supervisor sign it Go to the Emergency De partment for medical evaluation The Exposure Monitoring program operates by: Identifying work areas where there is a risk of exposure to blood borne pathogens Providing education and training on how to prevent and exposure Evaluating and treating those who have been exposed to blood borne pathogens such as Hepatitis B virus and Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) When reporting an exposure to blood borne pathogens, both the Report of Accident/Illness and the Employee's Claim for Worker's Compensati on Benefits must be filled out before reporting to the Emergency Depa rtment for medical evaluation. 42 Faith -Based Activities 43 Diversity of Beliefs Loma Linda University welcomes students from many different cultural and faith backgrounds with an emphasis on what we have in common, rather than our difference s. We believe that LOVE, HOPE and a longing for PEACE are universal. As members of a Christian university family, we endeavor to embrace these at tributes and to show RESPECT to all p ersons . Chapel Every Wednesday from 11:00am - 12:00 noon, during fall, winter and spring quarters, students meet in the L LU University Church for a C hapel Service. Students are expected to attend e ach week and attendance is recorded by badge readers a fter each session . Students are allowed two absences per term. If more than two chapels in one quarter are missed, the dean of the SAHP Office of Student Affairs will require such student to complete an assignment to remediate the absences(s) . If the requirements are not completed, a registration \"H old\" may be placed on the student's enrollment for subsequent quarters. If a student does not have a class or lab on campus on Wednesdays , that student is not required t o attend chapel. Week of Renewal For one week during fall , winter and spring quarters, the University engages in a series of programs entitle d \"Week of Renewal.\" During these special weeks, chapels will be held every day of the week, Monday - Friday, at 11 :00am. Students are required to attend these chapels each day unless the student does not have a class or lab on a given day. Lunch Power During fall , winter and spring quarters, the Lunch Power programs are presented by the SAHP Committee for Spiritual Life and Wholeness during the noon hour on Tuesdays for eight weeks. Student are welcome to enjoy a free meal provided by the Dean, and prepared by the Department of Nutrition & Dietetics. Lunch Power features a short devotional talk or a cultura l or musical presentation while students eat their meals. The SAHP ID badge is your pass to this free meal ; you are expected to stay for the presentation. Attendance at Lunch Power is optional. Held in Nichol Hall, Room 1609. Prayer Our faculty members r outinely begin the first class period of the day with prayer and a short devotional thought. You are also encouraged to share with the class. Ask your teacher to schedule a time when you can be the speaker, if you would like to be involved. Once the class chaplain is elected, that person is involved with the instructors, in organizing a devotional schedule. Any time you have worries, problems or illness, at home or at school, you are invited to talk with any of your teachers. We will be happy to talk with y ou, or pray with you. We have an open door policy which means you are welcome at any time we are in the office. Students may be referred to the student counseling services when a situation requires professional help. Other Activities Opportunities for service and spiritual growth may be found on bulletin boards, in emails from campus organizations and the online weekly LLU Newsgram . Church services are held each Saturday at several churches on campus. The Chaplain's office is in the Drayson Center. The Dea n of Student Affairs and the Chaplain, together with studen t leaders, often plan student activities at various locations, such as the Drayson or at the beach, etc. 44 Appendix 45 Department of Physical Therapy DEPARTMENT CHAIR Larry E.
