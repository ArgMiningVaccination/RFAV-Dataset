New Food Supplements is the new line of supplements for the nutritional needs of the 21st century. A complete range of natural products with an exclusive and scientifically tested formulation. Natural food supplements are useful preparations when a higher nutrient supplementation than usual standards is required. Among these, there are supplements containing vitamins, or those of vegetable proteins. The supplements perform the function of supplying the body, in sufficient quantities, with essential substances for physiological functions, when these substances are not supplied in adequate quantities with the diet. In any case, a correct use of these preparations should never be understood as a substitute for a balanced diet or a correct lifestyle. Food supplements are food products intended to supplement the common diet. They constitute a concentrated source of substances with a nutritional or physiological effect (eg vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, fibers and extracts of vegetable origin). Viridian Nutrition is the line of supplements made only with pure and 100% active ingredients, without thickeners or additives. The use of vegetable raw materials, with a high percentage of certified organic ingredients, make it particularly suitable for those who follow a vegan ban or for those suffering from food intolerances. Vegan Ok, Gluten Free, lactose intolerance, pregnant women and children. "}
