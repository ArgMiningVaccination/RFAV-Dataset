Program Overview 1.1 Program mission and organization The first Department of Architecture at the University of Utah was organized in 1949 within the College of Fine Arts and was authorized to grant the Bachelor of Architecture degree. The program received initial accreditation in 1954 from the National Archi tectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) and has been accredited continuously since. In 1974 the Department separated from the College of Fine Arts and became the Graduate School of Architecture (GSA) under the leadership of Dean Robert Bliss, FAIA. We operated a s a single -department college for almost 30 years, until under the leadership of Dean Brenda Scheer, FAIA, FAICP, the College successfully shepherded the relocation and expansion of the Department of Urban Planning into the GSA, which was renamed the Colle ge of Architecture + Planning in 2003. After building the planning program with faculty, enrollment, and curriculum, City & Metropolitan Planning (CMP) became an independent department in the College in 2007 alongside the School of Architecture (SoA). Dean Scheer then appointed Professor Patrick Tripeny as the first Director of the School. Today the College continues to grow, as the SoA is engaged in \"incubating\" another emerging program, Multi -Disciplinary Design (MDD ). The SoA has developed a number of core values throughout our history that reflect the ethical nature of architectural practice and provide a criticality and depth that guide our program: design excellence, community engagement and social equity , cutting edge technology and innovation, student empowerment, design -build, environmental resilience , and a globalized approach to history/theory/criticism. Design Excellence A commitment to design excellence has been a core value of the SoA beginning in 1949 with our first leader, Roger Bailey, FAIA. Bailey brought a variety of excellent designers to Utah to teach, including Charles Moore, Gordon Heck, and James Akland. The University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 6 architecture program proved indispensable to the University's development, providing the first sketches of a master plan for the University and eventually helping to develop the Campus Planning Office. The tradition of design excellence continues to this day with the hiring of leading practitioners in the region including Anne Mooney, AIA, in 2004 ; Prescott Muir, FAIA, as Chair in 2009 ; and Stephen Tobler, AIA, in 2010 . Professor Mooney is a principal architect of the award -winning practice Sparano + Mooney Architecture, which has offices in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, and is the 2014 AIA Western Region Young Architect of the Year. Professor Muir, a Fellow of the AIA, is a principal of Prescott Muir Architects, with offices in Salt Lake City and Beverly Hills. He has received 15 state and regional AIA design awards. Stephen Tobler is the prin cipal of Stephen Tobler Archite cts based in Portland, OR. The current Dean, Dr. Keith Diaz Moore, AIA, continu es to promote design excellence in architectural practice with the commencement of the annual Dean's Distinguished Lecturer in fall 2015, with Billie Tsien, FAIA, partner at Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, giving the inaugural lecture. Subsequent Dean's Distinguished Lecturers have been Maurice Cox, architect and Planning Director for the City of Detroit, in 2016 , and Bruce Mau, Canadian designer and educator based in Tor onto, in 2018. Community Engagement and Social Equity In 1963 Robert Bliss became the head of the Department. Under Bliss' direction, the architecture program became an independent professional school in 1974, offering a Master of Architecture rather th an a Bachelor of Architecture degree. In the meantime, the Department collaborated with AIA Utah to start a non -profit community design center, ASSIST Inc ., in 1969. ASSIST serves neighborhoods and individuals who would not otherwise be able to afford the services of an architect. While ASSIST eventually broke off from the School, students continue to work with ASSIST and gain experience in planning and practical construction processes ; and present and past directors of ASSIST have taught as adjunct faculty in the SoA. Today, the College offers every student an opportunity to serve communities bot h locally and nationally in our undergraduate and graduate level programs. The School has generated a long list of public -interest -driven graduate studios that elevate Utah's campus -wide commitment to community engagement, e.g., Women's Garden Shelter, North Temple Shelter (for the Unsheltered), Tibetan Community Center, Home for LGBT Youth, Ho me for Alzheimer's Patients, Hartland Living and Learning Center, Hartland Partnership Center, Utah Refugee Welcome Center, Park City Workforce Housing, Community Art & Live Work Center, Community + Arts Library, Flux Memorial/Tsunami Detection Center, and Tohoku Tsunami Center. We also offer special program s like University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 7 Chicago Lab , which gives students the opportunity to work with underrepresented communities in Chicago in the summer. In addition, in our 2016 Accreditation the School of Architecture received the ranking of \"Met with Distinction\" in the areas of \"Cultural Diversity and Social Equity\" and \"Community and Social Responsibility\" in recognition of courses such as Human Dimensions -Gender, Race, and Queer Theory developed and taught by Associate Profe ssor Lisa Henry Benham. The College continues to be very active in community engagement and is recognized nationally as a leader in public interest design. Technology and Innovation In the 1960s, the Architecture Department formed an alliance with the Com puter Sciences Department, where pioneering research was happening in computer graphics and art. In the early 1970s, the Graduate School of Architecture installed its first data processing unit, under the directorship of now Emeritus Professor Edward \"Ted\" Smith, FAIA, making the School one of the first in the country to begin experimenting with computer applications in architecture. Bliss also appointed Emeritus Professor Antonio \"Tony\" Serrato -Combe to the faculty, where he worked with Smith and others on a variety of software development and graphic visualization projects. Serrato -Combe continued to push innovation in the digital field for both design and research until his retirement in 2015. In 1993 , Associate Professor Julio Bermudez , PhD, was hired to continue the development of innovation in the field of digital technology and design. Bermudez and Associate Professor Jim Agutter developed a body of interdisciplinary scholarly work , which eventually became the foundation for the innovative Multi -Disciplinary Design (MDD ) Program. Directed first by Jim Agutter, the program was awarded the ability to offer a minor in 2011 and the n the Bachelor of Science in Design (BSD) degree in spring of 2013 . The first cohort of 12 students was accepted in the major in the fall of 2013, and the first class of BSD students graduated in 2015. Adding to the faculty ranks, Assistant Professor Elpitha Tsoutsounakis was awarded a career -line appointment in the spring of 2014 , and Associate Professor Cord Bowen wa s hired as the second director of MDD in 2016 . Conceived as an interdisciplinary educati onal experience, the MDD Program us es physical and digital product and platform design as a vehicle to investigate design research, human -centered design principles, interface development, articulation of product forms, materials , and digital manufacturing principles. The program has continued to grow and no w has one tenured, three c areer -line and numerous adjunct faculty. The program will seek departmental status in the next few years , as it continues to grow and increase the number of tenured and tenure -track faculty. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 8 Expanding the SoA's proficiency in digital technology and design, in 2015 the School hired Associate Professor Rima Ajlouni, PhD, an expert in using digital technology as a multidisciplinary research tool. The School's emphasis on technology and innovation through collaborat ions with research partner s, including the Kajima Corporation (until 2004) and Oldcastle Building Enclosure , led to co-develop ing research and teaching workshops in computer -aided design software, especially BIM (building information modeling) . The College also is spearheading an effort, along with the Marriott Library, to explore campus -wide initiatives in the area of digital fabrication. In the s pring of 2018 , we opened our new Fab Lab, an expansion of our wood and metal shop focused on digital fabricatio n and featuring a new large -format CNC machine. Another outgrowth of our collaboration with the Marriott Library is a major role in the development of the Digital Matters Lab, which is a site in the library for exploring emerging technologies and conside ring issues in the digital humanities. Student Empowerment In 1986, Carl Inoway, AIA, was appointed Dean and served until 1992. Dean Inoway focused on expanding the School and creating multiple tracks, which allowed each student to develop a personal phi losophy of professionalism and practice within the discipline of architecture, computer sciences in architecture, and historic preservation. In 1990, Dean Inoway initiated the pre -professional Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies (BSAS) degree program and created a 4+2 professional degree sequence in addition to the existing 3+ professional master's degree for students with non - architecture undergraduate d egrees. The SoA now offers a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies (BSAS) as the pre -professional degree, a Master of Architecture (M.Arch) as the accredited professional degree (with both two-year and 3+ tracks), and a post -professional Master of Science in Architectural Studies (MSAS) degree. The MSAS program was started in 1992 -93 and currently is directed by Professor Robert Young , PhD. It feature s concentrations in historic preservation, architectural technology, and project delivery . The SoA cu rrently has limited admission to the MSAS program while we complete the transition to our new curriculum and determine the new focus areas for the MSAS. Additionally, two dual degrees are offered - M.Arch/MSAS and M.Arch/MRED (a joint M.Arch/MBA also was o ffered through 2016) - and several interdisciplinary certificate programs design ed to acknowledge our students' chosen field of expertise (Historic Preservation, Real Estate, and Urban Design ). An interdisciplinary graduate certificate in Community Engagement currently is being developed. In 1992 William C. Miller, FAIA, was named Dean. Dean Miller's efforts focused on student development by creating a community of students and faculty and emphasizing University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 9 the connection with the professional community. Miller also empowered students to design their own educational experiences by creating a fluid graduate curriculum structure, in which core competencies are taught in the early years of the program to support a more student -structured sequence in later yea rs. Miller initiated a program of firm-sponsored scholarship s, which the current administr ation continues to develop . The School also has created an ongoing mentoring program with AIA Utah , and the local chapter of Women in Architecture (WIA) coordinates e vents and speed mentoring sessions with our students. Both the AIA and WIA offer annual scholarships as well. The connection to the professional community is further enhanced by a new studio space within the AIA Utah office in downtown Salt Lake City. This is the first such partnership in the U.S. and represents an exciting opportunity to hold architecture studios in a professional setting near the communi ties we wish to serve on the west side of Salt Lake City. In 2014 Dean Diaz Moore crafted a Dean's Student Council (StuCo) with representation from all degree programs and all levels within the College, and in 2015 the Chair of the School of Archi tecture, Mimi Locher, created the SoA Leadership Team including undergraduate and graduate architecture students. These two group s formalized a continued commitment to the active role of students in CA+P and SoA governance. Design -Build Dean Miller also reestablished the SoA's service and d esign -build activities begun with ASSIST through the development of the DesignBuildBLUFF (DBB) program. Miller, in partnership with local architect and alumnus Hank Louis, AIA, started the DBB program in 2000. It currentl y is led by Assistant Professor Jos\u00e9 Galarza, LEED AP, who was appointed in 2013. The program offers students an immersive hands -on opportunity to design and build a full -scale work of architecture in collaboration with the Navajo Nation in southeastern Utah, emphasizing sustainability and a respect for the unique social and cultural needs of its remote desert location. Over 2 90 students have taken part in the DBB program, which has completed 22 projects and received 15 national and 5 local design awards. The success of our DBB program ha s inspired the School to offer an additional design - build program based locally in Salt Lake City , as well as to develop additional immersive programs in other areas, such as urban design and historic preservation. Associate Professor J\u00f6rg R\u00fcgemer developed and piloted the Design Build Salt Lake program (D BSL) in 2017 -2018 , with an initial cohort of 9 students . This program is focused on buildi ng highly energy -efficient affordable housing in Salt Lake City with an emphasis on innovative sustainable construction methods and materials. In addition, the School has created an Immersive Experience Committee to establish criteria for the development University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 10 and evaluation of immersive programs to ensure that every graduate student has an opportunity to participate in an immersive academic experience . Environmental Resilience In 2002, the University selected Brenda Case Scheer, FAIA and FAICP, as its first female Dean of Architecture. Dean Scheer, in her first two years, achieved the long sought goal of bringing the undergraduate urban planning program, which had previously been housed in the Geography Department, into the same academic unit as architecture. Thus, the Graduate School of Architecture was renamed the College of Architecture + Planning (CA+P) in 2003. City & Metropolitan Planning (CMP) gained departmental status in 2007 and received its initial three -year Planning Accreditation Board (PAB) accreditation in 2011 . In 2014, CMP received a full seven -year accreditation of its professional master's degree, launched an innovative undergraduate degree in Urba n Ecology, and developed a PhD program. The connection with CMP has increased the variety of cur riculum offerings for architecture students to include collaborative studios (e.g. ARCH 6030/6031 Urban Design), cross -listed courses (e.g. CMP 3101/ARCH 2615 People + Place I & II), and shared graduate certificates in Historic Preservation, Real Estate De velopment, and Urban Design. The development and implementation of the Community Engagement certificate will further strengthen our ties to CMP , as well as our commitment to serving our local and regional communities . Three research centers also were established in the College during Dean Scheer's tenure, each further solidifying the CA+P's focus on innovative technology and sustainability. The Integrated Technology in Architecture Collaborative (ITAC) conducts research with academic and industry partners, provides education in the form of teaching and workshops, and conducts outreach with university and community groups. ITAC is focused on the research and development of sustainable building technologies, modern methods of construction, and collaboration and leadership methodologies in project delivery. ITAC has won numerous national awards from professional and academic organizations and has supported over 125 student s, with 60% as funded research assistants . The two additional research centers associated with the College include the Metropolitan Research Center and the Ecological Planning Center. These research centers provide considerable potential for research, community involvement, and engagement in sustainable co mmunities in Utah's unique and rapidly growing urban environment. In 2017, the Ecological Planning Center changed its name (and mission) to include design. The Center for Ecological Planning and Design (CEPD) now houses ITAC and is the hub for research and community projects related to sustainability and resilience. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 11 A Globalized Approach to History/Theory/Criticism In 2009, the School of Architecture appointed Prescott Muir, FAIA, as its second Director (the position title later was changed to \"Chair\" to bring it in line with University nomenclature). Muir brought a cl ose connection to the profession and a learned approach to design. He hired two exceptional history/theory/criticism (HTC) faculty mem bers during his tenure as Chair, Associate Professor Ole Fischer , PhD, and Assistant Professor Shundana Yusaf, PhD . These faculty not only have strengthened our HTC program, they also have introduced students to critical perspectives on globalization and the issues that face architects today. Part of this discourse takes place through the SoA's peer -reviewed journal Dialectic: A Journal of the School of Architecture. Established by Chair Muir, Dialectic brings together the most compelling voices in the discipline today on issues, values, methods, a nd debates important to the community of educators at the University of Utah. As editors of Dialectic, Fischer and Yusaf are committed to infusing studio culture with critical concerns and an academic rigor that is essential to every institution of higher education. Muir also hired three new faculty members in the area of design, Ass ociate Professor Erin Carraher, AIA ; Associate Professor (Clinical) Steven Tobler, AIA ; and Professor (Clinical) Dan Hoffman, AIA. They all are equally committed to excellence in design and strengthening the SoA's culture of making and design excellence . Current Vision of the College In 2013 Associate Professor Keith Bartholomew, JD, was appointed Interim Dean of the College. Although the CA+ P's primary task during this time was to appoint a new D ean, Bartholomew also focused on the development of more transparent and coherent governing structures for both the College and the SoA. In 2014 Professor Keith Diaz Moore, PhD, AIA, was appointed Dea n of the College of Architecture + Planning and continued the activity of rewriting governance structures. Diaz Moore also led the faculty in a process of rearticulating the mission and vision for the C ollege. The new mission states our belief that \"the global dynamics of population growth and aging, environmental degradation and resource inequality challenge 21st century architects, designers and planners to think, work and make in new ways,\" and \"challenges students, faculty, alumni and clients to seize upon these intrinsic resources to inform the creation of purposeful, aesthetically -elegant interventions that foster ecological, social and economic resilience, and further health and well -being for all, especially those for whom design makes the greatest difference.\" The mission states four commitments to guide our approach to these challenges: 1. Responsibility: A responsibility to past, present and future generations for the sustainability of our creative expressions that reallocate natural resources; University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 12 2. Resilience: A systemic understanding that polycultures and diversity nurture greater ecological and community resilience; 3. Respect: A respect for the health and culture of all places; and 4. Response: The demand to respond to the grand challenges of our time through innovative and collaborative modes of practice that demonstrate our commitment to excellence and quality. (http://www.cap.utah.edu/visiongoals ) Current Vision and Mission of the SoA In January 2014 Interim Dean Bartholomew appointed Associate Professor Mira \"Mimi\" Locher, FAIA, to the newly -defined Associate Chair position , charged with readying the SoA for its 2016 National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) accreditation, and in 2015 Diaz Moore appointed Locher as the first female Chair of the SoA. Locher continues to uphold the seven Core Values of the University with a particular focus on service through comm unity engagement and global citizenship. In addition, Associate Professor Lisa Henry Benham was appointed to the Associate Chair role in 2015. Following a very successful NAAB accredit ation process in 2016 , in which the school received a full eight - year te rm, Locher and Henry Benham have led the full faculty in a two-year process to respond to the College's new vision by designing a new integrated curriculum that is reflective and dynamic. The faculty continues to explore the challenges of the discipline \u2014social equity, global citizenship, ecological resilience \u2014and how these challenges redefine design excellence. The new curriculum is focused on the processes and integration of design, research, and critical creative thinking to better reflect the necessary transformation of architectural practice. The SoA faculty is envisioning progressive pedagogies that equip our students with a new way of thinking about architecture and the skills and knowledge that give them a unique kind of agency. The reimagined curriculum makes meaningful connections between our different areas of instruction: design, history/theory/criticism, building technology, communications, and professional practice , through the design of a n innovative sequen ce of integrated courses taught collaboratively to illustrate the connections between areas of instruction and the importance of each area for the ethical practice of architecture. In addition, the curriculum integrates the College and the School's mission and ethical framework in a transparent way. At the heart of the new SoA curriculum is the recognition that architectural practice is inherently value -laden and that therefore recognition of the values underlying our processes and products is essential in our research and teaching. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 13 The current SoA mission states, The University of Utah School of Architecture is committed to the belief that architectural education must take as its object the production of thoughtful and humane architects capable of thinking as creatively about their representations of the world as they think about bui lding technology and design. The School of Architecture approaches teaching and practice with a rigor that holds us, and others, accountable to high standards, without losing a sense of adventure, risk -taking, and discovery. We are dedicated to mentoring y oung people to help them discover where their passions lie. Four core beliefs und erpin the SoA 's approach and directly connect our approach to the CA+P's Four Commitments : Architects must take Responsibility for their work as a form of political discours e. Architects must be focused on social, economic, and environmental Resiliency . Architects must Respect and Respond to the communities in which they work. Architects must be committed to Design excellence and ecology . (The full document is available online: http://soa.cap.utah.edu/vision -and-mission/ .) The School of Architecture is the leading regional center for promoting the value of architecture through an understanding of the vital role that thoughtful, well -designed built environments have in the physical and emotional well -being of individuals and communities. We support creativity and innovation in architecture and design through critical understanding, collaborative research, and social and ecological responsibility. As architects and designers, students and teachers, we are dedicated to confronting the imperative issues of our time - including air quality, water accessibility, public health, and social equity - and to doing the greatest possible good for society and the world through our work. 1.2 Program planning The long range planning process of the SoA is a multi -pronged course of action involving students, faculty, staff, and administrators. In addition to working within the mission , strategic goals , and core values of the University ( see https://president.utah.edu/universitystrategy/ ) and meeting the expectations of the University regarding external accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), the planning process of the SoA is integrally connected to the CA+P's long range plan. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 14 A College -wide retrea t in January 2015 identified numerous important long -term initiatives that the College Leadership Team (consisting of the Dean, Associate Deans, and Departments Chairs and Directors ) then refined into 25 SMART goals (http://www.cap.utah.edu/college -goals/ ). The SMART goals are an important part of the University's institutional planning and budget processes and form the foundation for the CA+P's and SoA's long range plan. Additionally, the National Architectural Accrediting Board 's five Defining Perspectives - Collaboration and Leadership, Design, Professional Opportunity, Stewardship of the Environment, and Community and Social -Approved -2014 -NAAB -Conditions - for-Accreditation.pdf ) provide a framework by which the School and College can judge the value of the goals identified as being of primary importance. During summer 2015, the SoA Chair and Associate Chair revised the School's long range plan and short term goals based on the CA+P SMART goals and end -of-semester all - faculty reviews of course content and student work products. The plan and goals were presented to the SoA faculty for review and revision at the School's August 2015 retreat. The revised long range planning document can be found in Appendix I . The following CA+P SMART goals were ident ified as primary for the SoA in the 2015 -18 academic year s. The text following each goal explains the actions taken by the CA+P and SoA to meet these goals. (The next round of SMART Goals will be developed during the 2018 -19 academic year.) SMART Goals 2, 3, and 6: 2) Increase the number of students receiving assistantships, internships, and other compensated professional experiences by 50 percent by AY2018; 3) Raise the average ACT of admitted undergraduate students to 24.5 or higher by 2017 and 25.0 by 2019; and 6) Increase external support (gifts, grants, contracts) to over $2 million annually by AY2018 and tie into the SoA's plan for the recruitment and r etention of students, especially women and other minorities, which is a key component of the College's long range planning efforts. The CA+P and SoA developed a number of new initiatives to address recruitment and retention , including a comprehensive regional recruitment plan (see CA+P Recruitment Plans in Appendix I ), which includes visiting regional universities and community colleges to meet with prospective students and to update and expand articulation agreements , as well as studying the potential results of changing the prerequisite mathematics class to trigonometry from calculus, which has been identified as a current barrier to entry for many students. (Goals 2 and 3 have been met and are discussed in Section 1.3 [see #2 and #3 under Recommendation 1] , as are regarding Goal 6 [see #4 under Recommendation 1] .) University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 15 SMART Goal 4: Implement a meaningful set of interdisciplinary learning experiences for our st udents by fall 2016. The CA+P initiated this effort during the first week of the fall 2015 semester with an all - College vertical charrette. Faculty -led teams of undergraduate and graduate architecture, design, urban ecology, and urban planning students addressed the theme of \"Water and 'The Sacred,'\" which was chosen to connect to the October 2015 meeting of the Parliament of the World's Religions in Salt Lake City, where the winning designs were displayed. Teams designed sacred spaces celebrating the historic fresh water spring at Salt Lake City's Artesian Well Park. The charrette experience has become an a nnual event, with the fall 2016 focus on Aging , and student s creating short videos to reflect their research on the topic, and in 2017 students researched Affordable Housing and produced posters . In the 2018 -19 academic year, the all -College charrette will take place in the spring semester to better accommodate fall student orientations. In fall 2017, the CA+P debuted a new Design Foundations curriculum, which is a set of three entry -level undergraduate courses that are required for all students planning to major in one of the three majors in the CA+P (architecture, multi -disciplinary design, and urban ecology). The se courses not only provide students with a broad foundation in our disciplines, they also create a strong cohort experience that we hope will continue through the students' graduate years. SMART Goal 5: By Spring 2016, have a plan for building upon and advancing the core mission of DesignBuild BLUFF (DBB) to provide design -build service learning involving students and communities in need. The SoA's goal is to be a national leader in community engagement. To this end, DBB Director Jos\u00e9 Galarza has been working to further develop the program's connections at the University and in the Navajo Nation and to explore an expanded role for its headq uarters in Bluff, UT. In addition, SoA Associate Professor Ryan Smith was named the inaugural CA+P Associate Dean for Research and Community Engagement (ADRCE) in 2015 , a po sition he held until his departure to become the Director of the School of Design a nd Construction at Washington State University. In the ADRCE role, he guided efforts to increase the impact of CA+P and SoA initiatives in the community and discipline. To assist faculty in developing new opportunities for serving communities in the Salt Lake area, Smith developed guidelines and a policy for community engagement, including a list of resources offered by University Neighborhood Partners. (With Ryan Smith's recent departure, the Associate Dean for Research and Community Engagement University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 16 position currently is not filled. Dean Diaz Moore plans to request funding for a new line to fill this position in the next budget cycle.) In 2017 Associate Professor J\u00f6rg R\u00fcgemer developed the Design -Build Salt Lake (DBSL) program to serve the local community and also provide a local alternative to DBB for students who are interested in design -build but are unable to spend a semester in Bluff, UT. The first design project is a collaboration with the Salt Lake City government, a set of three highly energy -efficient affordable houses on a single plot. After construction, the City will sell the houses but maintain ownership of the land as a community land trust, a new model for Salt Lake City. Currently the DBSL students are working under a licensed contractor on the construction of multiple unit s of affordable housing in Kearns, UT, in conjunction with Habitat for Humanity. As we move into the second year of our new curriculum (2019 -2020), students will begin the DBSL experience by working on the construction of the previous year's design during the summer and then will complete the design of the subsequent project during the fall semester. SMART Goal 8: By AY 2017, create a program for learning spaces within our existing building that fosters the ability to collaboratively engage in new modes of learning, thinking and making. The CA+P recently has made significant changes in our learning spaces, including the implementation of smaller desks in our studio spaces , the replacement of sofas with tables and chairs on the second floor balcony, the conversion of a computer lab into a flexible classroom, and the reconfiguration of the lower level central space to include a caf\u00e9, student success center, fabrication lab, and studio teaching spaces . The smaller studio desks free up space in the studios for groups of tables that are used as collaborative working areas. These collaborative areas are used for group discussions, model -making, etc., and are a welcome addition to the studios. Students also now can meet in small groups on the second floor balcony (outside the College office), where tables and chairs replaced some of the sofas that previously occupied the space, as well as in the new Brio caf\u00e9 space on the lower level, which includes informal study spaces with individual and group seating. Additionally, R oom 128 was transformed from a computer lab into a multi -media teaching space with three digital projectors , a magnetic white bo ard wall, five large format monitors, and tables and chairs on casters. The room can be configured in many different ways, allowing both traditional classroom teaching and innovative methods. In the central space of the lower level, a new fabrication lab with a large format CNC mill has been created, increasing the SoA's capabilities in digital fabrication. O nce University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 17 construction is complete, students also will have access to our Student Success Team of advisors in a new Student Success Center in the southwest corner of that space . 1.3 Previous review and actions See Appendix A for previous Graduate Council summary report, memorandum of understanding, and subsequent follow -up reports. Actions taken since the 2016 follow -up report to the Memorandum of Understanding derived from the 2011 -12 Graduate Council Review are shown below, based on the original list of recommendations from the MoU. Recommendation 1: An updated, program -specific five -year strategic plan that incorporates the newly devised mission statement and also includes program goals and objectives should be completed as planned. This strategic plan should be based on input from all faculty and be revisited annually to assess progress towards the established objectives and goals. In the 2016 update , the recommendation was noted as fully addressed in a sustainable manner. The update noted seven major goals of the 2015 School of Architecture strategic plan , which are listed below, along with a report of the progres s made on each goal. 1. Re-imagination of the undergraduate and graduate curricula. The curriculum re -imagination process begun in fall 2016 and facilitated by the Center for T eaching and Learning Excellence (CTLE) has resulted in innovative new teaching and learning methods for both our undergraduate and graduate curricula. Led by Pam Hardin of CTLE, Associate Chair Lisa Henry Benham, and Chair Mimi Locher, the full faculty of the School of Architecture have met monthly since fall 2016 to determine the degree of curriculum change we want, establish our values as a School of Architecture, and develop an ethical framework for the curricula. The faculty determin ed that the best course of action was a complete curriculum re -imagination, one that would build on the integrated courses we developed prior to our 2016 NAAB accreditation. We agreed, as a full faculty, to develop and teach courses in a collaborat ive manner and where possible to integrate coursework within our varied topics areas (building technology, communication, design studio, history/theory/criticism, and professional practice). The process is ongoing, with the Chair and Associate Chair leadin g monthly summer teaching training workshops for adjunct faculty to learn about the curriculum as well as important teaching principles, such as University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 18 designing transparent assignments, developing learning objectives, and creating grading rubrics. Current result s and curriculum process documentation are documented in Appendix J. 2. Increase the number of students receiving assistantships, internships, and other compensated professional experiences by 50 percent by AY2018. Since spring 2016, we have been able to add $30,000 to fund seven new Graduate Assistantships. For the 2018 -19 academic year , 93% of students requesting a TA or GA position were awarded at least a one-semester position, with 30% of those students awarded a TA or GA position both semesters and another 30% awarded a TA or GA position one semester and a scholarship the second semester . (Students who did not receive TA or GA positions had GPAs below the minimum threshold.) This is up from 75% of students who requested a TA or GA position receiving a position in 2016 -17. 3. Raise the average ACT of admitted undergraduate students to 24.5 or higher by 2017 and 25.0 by 2019. This goal has been met ahead of schedule - the a verage ACT score for admitted Design Foundations (freshmen) students in fall 2018 was 25.8. 4. Increase external support (gifts, grants, contracts) [in the College] to over $2 million annually by AY2018 and tie into the SoA's plan for the recruitment and retention of students, especially women and other minorities. While we see great improvement in recruitment and retention of students in our undergraduate program (see #5 below) , graduate application numbers have continued to be below our expectations. Whi le this mirrors national trends, we feel that we offer both exceptional value and outstanding academic opportunity for graduate architecture education and can leverage this to attract more students from both within and outside of Utah. To this end, the CA+ P has engaged a recruitment consulting firm to raise graduate application numbers for both the Master of Arc hitecture and Master of City & Metropolitan Planning degree programs. The goal for spring 2019 is a 20% increase of applicants , with an eye to incre asing applicant diversity . In order to support current students and the expected increase in new students, it is imperati ve to continue to build our resources for student support. Semester - length Teaching Assistantships, Graduate A ssistantships, and scholarships University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 19 typically are offered at the amount that triggers the Tuition Benefit Program (currently $3,875). Graduate Assistant positions are used mostly for recruitment - to attract high -quality out -of-state students to the 3+ and two -year programs. Since Dean Diaz Moore's arrival in fall 2014, we've seen an increase in funding for TA and GA positions from $94,500 in FY15 to $144,000 and have added another $30,000 since that time. The SoA has eight endowed s cholarships and 13 renewable firm -sponsor ed scholarships for a total amount of $131,000 (including $15,000 first made available by the Dean in FY16 through a matching program for new scholarships with the UofU Graduate School). With the hire in 2017 of a full -time Director of Development, progress in development and advancement has proceeded well, although the $2 million goal for ext ernal support remains elusive (the CA+P has averaged just over $880,000 in gifts, grants, and contracts per year for the last 4 financial years). However, specific to the SoA, s everal new firm -funded scholarships for architecture students have been created and additional student funding has come from sources like the local Women in Architecture group. New scholarships for undergraduate students in the Design Foundations program housing cluster also have been added. By the end of the 2018 -19 academic year, we expect to receive two new endowed scholarship funds, including one from AIA Utah in the amount of $100,000. 5. Implement a meaningful set of interdisciplinary learning experiences for our students by fall 2016. From fall 2015, the SoA piloted a series of \"immersive experiences\" for students in the M.Arch program. The experiences are sets of two or three courses, including a design studio, that are taught in an integrated way. For example, a design studio is paired with a theory seminar and a building technology course. While two of the three immersive experiences integrate courses from within the architecture curriculum, one option integrates an urban design studio taught by a faculty member from urban planning with an urban theory course taught by an architecture faculty member. These graduate experience s also offer the opportunity for greater collaboration with the faculty from urban planning. At the undergraduate level, in the 2017 -18 academic year, the CA+P started a new program for students majoring in any discipline in our College - architecture, design, or urban ecology. Called \"Design Found ations, \" the program consists of three interdisciplinary courses that all majors in the C ollege University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 20 are required to take (preferably in their freshman year). These courses, Design Foundations Workshop (ARCH 2630), Design Contexts (DES 2630), and Design Ecologi es (CMP 2010), are taught collaboratively by faculty from all three CA+P academic units. This new program has led to a 9% increase in CA+P majors from 2016 -17 to 2017 -18, and an additional 16% increase in CA+P majors this academic year (including a 13% increase in pre -architecture students) . 6. By Spring 2016, have a plan for building upon and advan cing the core mission of Design BuildBLUFF (DBB) to provide design -build service learning involving students and communities in need. Since his arrival at the University of Utah in summer 2013, the current DesignBuildBLUFF Director, Assistant Professor Jos\u00e9 Galarza, has worked to transition the program from an independent non -profit to a program housed officially within the College. He has esta blished and formalized systems, so that the program no longer is reliant on a single individual, and the curricular component s are strengthened. Galarza created mission and vision statements and clarified terms of reference, staff job descriptions, and acc ounting practices. He created co -requisite courses that prepare students to work with communities such as the Navajo Nation and the town of Bluff, UT. With the DBB students, he has worked to promote the program through the DBB website, blog, and other social media. Once the systems of the program were formalized, other architecture and planning faculty have become involved in efforts in Bluff, and other University of Utah departments and southeastern Utah non -profits also have collaborated with DBB or uti lized the facilities in Bluff. For example, Urban Ecology students worked with the town of Bluff to create a document that would help guide them through the process of incorporation. This effort won a 2017 American Planning Association Small Town and Rural Planning (STaR) James A. Segedy Award. In 2017 -18, Major 1 (junior -year architecture) students worked in Bluff on a studio project in collaboration with the Consortium of Dark Sky Studies. Related University projects include t he D epartment of Sociology 's community based participatory research project connected to a $4 million restorative justice grant in San Juan County; and th e department of Anthropology use of the DBB facilities in Bluff to begin a study of the use of wood fuel in the Bears Ears area, wi th funding from NSF. In summer 2017, in partnership with Utah Dine Bikeyah, DBB hosted the artist Alisha Anderson, who created short films that engaged the native community and the land. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 21 With the success of DesignBuildBLUFF as a foundation and the recognition of the great need for a similar program in the Salt Lake area, the SoA currently is piloting a new program, Design Build Salt Lake (DBSL). Under the direction of Associate Professor J\u00f6rg R\u00fcgemer , DBSL partners with organizations such as the city of Sa lt Lake and Habitat for Humanity in the design and construction of highly energy efficient affordable housing. In spring 2018, students designed three single family homes on a plot of land owned by Salt Lake City; and in fall 2018, students are engaged in the construction of the Field of Dreams EcoCommunity High -Performance Affordable Housing in Kearns, UT. The goal is to establish DBSL as one of the SoA's annual graduate immersive experiences. 7. By AY 2017, create a program for learning spaces within our existing building that fosters the ability to collaboratively engage in new modes of learning, thinking and making. In the 2017 -18 academic year, we tested a new system of smaller individual desks combined with communal learning spaces in the design studios . This proved successful, and we now have replaced all the individual desks in the primary studio spaces (third floor of the architecture building) with the new desks and communal work areas. Additionally, Room 128 was transformed from a computer lab into a multi -media classroom with three projectors, a magnetic white board wall, five large monitors, and tables and chairs on casters for easy reconfiguration of the space. In spring 2018, the CA+P opened the Fab-Lab, a making space that features a large forma t CNC machine. Recommendation 2: At present, program assessment is primarily based on anecdotal evidence. Although it is apparent that student input is taken seriously, as it has been used constructively to improve the program, efforts should be undertaken to acquire objective, quantifiable data that may be used to assess program outcomes. An objective assessment instrument that requires numeric input could be designed and implemented in conjunction with the exit interviews currently conducted with graduates by the Director. Similar instruments could be used annually with both graduating students and alumni to allow for anonymous input and generate a database for assessing quantifiable program changes over time. In the 2016 update , the recommendation was noted as mos tly addressed , with specific tasks identified for completion. We continue to use various sources and methods to assess our under graduate and graduate programs, including both qualita tive and quantitative methods. At the national level, we use t he pass rate s for the Architecture Registration Exam (ARE), which is the professiona l licensing exam for architects. These University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 22 rates show that graduates of the University of Utah are passing the six parts of the ARE 5.0 (which went into effect in 2016) at a rate equal to or exceeding the national average . University of Utah alumni score an average of 11 percentage points over the national average . (See https://www.ncarb.org/pass -are/are5/ pass -rates/are5 -pass -rates -school for d etails.) At the school level, a t the end of each semester, we hold public juries of student work, which allows us to receive formal input from th e local profe ssional community; and the full faculty also reviews student work for fulfillment of the National Architectural Accrediting Board 's 26 Student Performance Criteria. The Chair continues to conduct individual exit interviews with senior students in the fall semester and graduating M.Arch students in the spring semester , and the SoA perform s periodic alumni surveys. Regularly scheduled formal and informal venues for feedback from students, alumni, and the professional community include the Dean's Advisory Council, the SoA Leadersh ip Team (which includes student leaders and is the advisory body to the Chair), and monthly Chats with the Chair (open to all students). In a ddition, both the Dean and Chair are active on the board of AIA Utah, which provides for a close relationship with the professional community. Recommendation 3: The accelerated program at the graduate level, although successful locally, appears to lack broader visibility. To increase awareness and grow the enrollment among nonresident and international students, the accelerated master's program should be advertised more widely. Although it may be difficult at present, increasing the number of students in the undergraduate program would positively impact the program. In the 2016 update , the recommendation was not addressed, as the accelerated program was cancelled for low enrollment. The update noted that the viability of the program would be discussed once the curriculum re -imagination process was complete. As the SoA faculty continues to develop and transition the curriculum, this discussion has not yet taken place, and until the number of incoming graduate students rises, the accelerated program will not be viable. Recommendation 4: All efforts to continue to build faculty and student diversity should be maintained and enhanced. Ongoing recruitment efforts to increase student quality and diversity should be continued and expanded. The Office of the Associate Vice President for Equity and Diversity is committed to this goal and may provide useful ideas and strategies in this regard. The use of annual progress reports to the Graduate School should be considered as a way to encourage the Department to work effectively towards this goal. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 23 In the 2016 update , this recommendation was noted as fully addressed in a sustainable manner. Since that time, no new tenure -line faculty have been hired , and one white male tenured faculty left for a leadership position at another university , putting the percentage of underrepresented fulltime (tenured, tenure -track, and career -line) faculty at 53%. In the 2018 -19 academic year, of the two Visiting Assistant Professors hired, one is female, and of the adjunct faculty teaching at 0.25 FTE or more, more than 50% are female or from another underrepresented group. See Section 2.2 for additional inform ation on faculty diversity. When the CA+P instituted the new Design Foundations curriculum in fall 2017, we discontinued Architecture LEAP in order to promote a College -wide cohort experience for our first -year students. For the 2017 -18 academic year, 31% of the Design Foundations students self-identified as underrepresented, and 40% of the DF cohort identified as female, for a total of 62% of students identifying as female and/or from an underrepresented group. At the start of the fall 2018 semester, 18% of the Design Foundations students self-identified as underrepresented, and 37% of the DF cohort identified as female, for a total of 48% of students identifying as female and/or from an underrepresented group . In the architecture major cohort (juniors and seniors), in 2017, 62% of identified as female and/or from an underrepresented group (40% of the undergraduate majors identified as female) . In 2017 in the graduate architecture program, 43% of students identified as female and/or underrepresented ( 30% of the graduate students identified as female ). Please see additional statistics in Section 3.2. With our current College -wide focus on graduate recruitment and engagement of an outside recruiting consultant, we expect to continue to increase the number of students who identify as female and from other underrepresented groups. Recommendation 5: Development efforts should be continued. Development priorities should include a capital campaign to refit and expand the Architecture Building, purchase of additional digital fabrication equipment to keep the program current, more funds for salary enhancement, professional development and sabbatical opportunities for faculty, and promotional efforts to increase the national visibility of the School. Additionally, to assist the student recruitment effort, resources to grow the number of scholarships and teaching assistantship opportunities for students should also be pursued. In the 2016 update , this recommendation was noted as mostly addressed, with specific tasks identified for completion. Since then, the CA+P has hired a full -time Director of Development, Angie Roberts , JD, and progress in development and advancement has proceeded well. A total of $1.25 million has been raised for capital improvements to the architecture building, and s everal new firm-funded scholarships for architecture students University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 24 have been created . Additi onally - as noted previously, by the end of the academic year, we expect to receive two new endowed scholarship funds, including one from AIA Utah in the amount of $100,000. Several significant upgrades to the architecture building have been completed si nce 2016. The central exhibit and review space, the Bailey Gallery, has been acoustically retrofit, allowing for greater and more comfortable use of this important space. This retrofit followed a necessary upgrade of the fire sprinkler system, which also a llowed for the replacement of some old lights with new energy -efficient fixtures. In keeping with the Dean's goal of creating spaces conducive to collaborat ive teaching and learning, Room 128 (formerly a computer lab) has been transformed into a multi -medi a teaching and learning space with three digital projectors, document cameras, a magnetic white board wall, five large format monitors, and tables and chairs on casters. This room now is a popular teaching and meeting space. Additionally, a major transformation currently is taking place in the central space on the lower level of the architecture building. Brio, our resident caf\u00e9 , moved into the north end of the lower level, and in spring 2018, the CA+P opened a new fabrication lab (Fab Lab) in the southeast end, featuring a large format CNC mill . A Student Success Center is being designed for the southwest corner, with offices and meeting spaces for our advising team, and a new wall will separate the caf\u00e9 from the central teaching area. In addition, the public restrooms in the building have received a much needed renovation. Due to the quick growth of our undergraduate Design Foundations program, the CA+P has had to expand into space outside of the architecture building. We have renovat ed four former racquetball courts in the old Einar Nielsen Fieldhouse (about a 10 -minute walk from the architecture building) into studio spaces. Currently one space is used by a graduate -level architecture studio, and the other three are \"hot desk\" (shared) studios for pre -majors in Design Foundations, Multi -Disciplinary Design, and Architecture. Additionally, we have an exciting new collaboration with AIA Utah - the AIA is renovating space in a historic building in downtown Salt Lake City, and the CA+P will have a studio within the AIA office suite. This innovative collaboration is the first of its kind in the U.S. and will provide students with a state -of-the-art studio space in a professional working environment. Completion of the construction of the AIA/CA+P space is expected in October 2018. Recommendation 6: The School should consider establishing a more formalized mechanism to enhance consistent communication of events, deadlines and opportunities across the entire School community. Scheduling periodic informational gatherings of the entire School, along with regular communiqu\u00e9s, would also serve to provide a more formal mechanism of communication, particularly between faculty and students. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 25 In the 2016 update , this recommendation was noted as mostly addressed , with specific tasks identified for completion. Since 2016 the SoA has created a shared folder on UBox (the U niversity's online storage tool), which has been used continuously for committee meeting notes and other important i nformation, with access available to all faculty. The process for organizing the lecture series and other SoA events has been formalized by the Academic Culture and Outreach Committee, and a calendar of events has been added to the CA+P website with a link from the SoA website. The SoA now also supports a Graduate Assistant who works with the Chair and the CA+P Public Relations Specialist, Ashley Babbitt, MSC, to advertise and document events, update the website, and increase the S chool's presence on social media. At the C ollege level, we host an annual Graduate Experience Open House for all graduate students who have been admitted into our degree programs. For this event, the SoA provides flights and lodging for all domestic out -of-state students, which h as proven to be a very useful recruiting tool. In fall 20 18, the CA+P had its first all -College convocation, during which new faculty and staff were introduced and special events were announced. Recommendation 7: The School may wish to consider alternat ive strategies to its present policy for the granting of graduate student aid. The granting of somewhat fewer, but higher, graduate stipends would be one way to attract more, and potentially stronger, students from outside the state. This may also serve to attract more diverse and international students. In the 2016 update , this recommendation was noted as fully addressed in a sustainable manner. Please see goal #2 of the 2015 School of Architecture strategic plan noted under recommendation #1 above. 1.4 Professional accreditation review and actions The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) is the official accrediting body for professional architecture degrees (Bachelor and Master of Architecture) in the United States. As per its mission, NAAB \" develops and maintains a system of accreditation in professional architecture education that is responsive to the needs of society and allows institutions with varying resources and circumstances to evolve according to their individual needs\" (https://www.naab.org/info/mission/). Professional degree programs, such as our M.Arch, undergo an intensive accreditation process at least every eight years and must submit annual reports summarizing program statistics and changes . The NAAB accreditation requires that the program demonstrate improvement in all areas deemed weak in the previous accreditation, respond to NAAB's Defining Perspectives (see University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 26 discussion in previous section), and prove successful execution of 26 Student Performance Criteria ( SPCs ). The NAAB accreditation review includes a comprehensive Architecture Program Report (APR) , examples of student work (high and low pass work from every course taught in the graduate program), and a visit by external reviewers representing the American Institute of Architects (AIA, the major professional organization for architects in the United States - see www.aia.org ), American Institute of Architects Students (AIAS, the student organization of the AIA - see www.aias.org ), Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA, the academic organization for accredited architecture programs in North America - see www.acsa -arch.org ), and Nationa l Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB, the body that develops and applies standards for licensing and credentialing architects in the United States - see www.ncarb.org ). The most recent accreditation visit for the School of Architecture took place in January/February 2016 , with a comprehensive self -study (Architecture Program Report or APR) completed in fall 2015 . The 2015 APR is available on the Scho ol of Architecture website (http://soa.cap.utah.edu/wp -content/uploads/sites/3/2014/10/University -of-Utah - APR_2015.pdf ), and binders of course information (syllabi for all courses and examples of student work for all non -studio courses) are available in the School of Architecture. The 2016 accreditation visit was very successful, resulting in a full eight -year accreditation. In their final report, the visiting team noted, \"Utah's program exhibited effective administration, governance, mission, teaching, research, diversity, curricular integrity, community engagement, and sensitivity to context.\" The full Visiting Team Report (VTR) is available on the School of Architecture website at: http://soa.cap.utah.edu/wp -content/uploads/sites/3/2014/10/NAAB -2016 -Visiting - Team -Report.pdf . The result of the 2016 NAAB accreditation was especially important to the School of Architecture. As a faculty, we had worked to address the concerns in our previous accreditation visit, which had resulted in a three -year accreditation. At that time, the Visiting Team noted nine conditions that were not met (including governance, curricular review and development, and five Student Performance Criteria) and included in its list of Causes of Concern a \"lack of clear and formal communication procedures.\" (The complete report is available at http://www.arch.utah.edu/pdFs/VTR_9 -10- 2013web.pdf .) Because of our work to successfully address the issues brought forth in the 2013 accreditation visit, the faculty realized the potential of several new curricular idea s we had piloted. At the suggestion of Dean Diaz Moore, Chair Locher and Associate Chair Henry Benham led the faculty in a series of discussions that resulted in our decision to University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 27 completely re -imagine our undergraduate and graduate curricula (the results of which are discussed in the S ection 1.3 and included in Appendix J ). 1.5 School profile See Appendix B for School profile. Please note that the Multi -Disciplinary Design (MDD) Program, while currently situated under the umbrella of the School of Architecture, is administered by its own Director (Cord Bowen) and Associate Director (Elpitha Tsoutsounakis). The goal for MDD is to be an independent academic unit within the CA+P in the next several years , and in 2017 the Program underwent its three -year review by the Undergraduate Council . Because of these efforts , and sinc e the Bachelor of Science in Design degree offered by MDD does not feed into the Master of Architecture program, MDD program data is not comprehensively included in this report. Please see Appendix K for MDD program information. Student enrollment in architecture at the University of Utah tends to follow national trends, and also is connected closely to the economic state of the construction industry locally and nationally . When a decline in the construction industry leads to fewer jobs in architecture firms (such as that resulting from the 2008 economic downturn) , we find that our graduate enrollment initially increases. An extended economic downturn tends to lead to architecture being seen as a less viable profession, which then results in fewer under graduate and graduate applications. When the local economy and construction industry is healthy (as it currently is), many of our undergraduates choose to work for several years before returning for their graduate education, thus affecting the number of graduate applicants.

See Appendix C for information from Survey of Earned Doctorates related to racial/ethnic and gender diversity for doctoral recip ients within the field nationwide. It is important to note that for architecture faculty who come to teaching from practice, it is highly unusual to have a PhD. For professional architects, the terminal degree is the accredited Master of Architecture degree, and most design faculty at school s of architecture start their careers in professional practice and then move into academia. Of our current 14 core full -time faculty members, five have PhDs (three men and two women, including two people identifying as foreign -born non-white) and three are in progress (one man and two women, including one U.S born person identifying as non -white). University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 33 Since the last review, the School of Architecture has increased diversity in the architecture full-time teaching faculty . We have hired three male faculty (one L atino [U.S. born] and two white) and have had three male faculty leave or retire (also one Latino [foreign -born ] and two white). We also have hired t wo women (one of Middle Eastern descent [foreign -born ] and one whi te). We therefore have a net gain of two women . We make a point to advertise our positions in both sites with a broad diversity reach (such as the Chronicle of Higher Education and Higheredjobs.com, as well as discipline - speci fic sites like ACSA and AIA) as well as those with a more specialized focus ( such as HERS - Higher Education Research Service ). We also have increased our reach by leveraging faculty members' personal academic networks. We send out our job postings widely and request that our associates in other institutions share them with qualified candidates. In professional schools of architecture nationwide, the diversity statistics show the number of non -white faculty whose race is known (including those of two or more races but not includi ng non -resident aliens) was about 18% in 2011 and about 19% in 2015 (the most recent year for which data is available - see http://www.acsa - arch.org/images/default -source/conference -hotel -images/atlas -201703.jpg?sfvrsn=0 ). Comparatively, the full -time architecture teaching faculty at University of Utah School of Architecture are 21% non -white as well as 57% female. Since the national averages for the number of female architecture students and graduate s has remained at about 40% in recent years , and the number of women working in professional architecture roles continues to be at about 25% (see http://www.acsa -arch.org/resources/data - resources/women ), it is clear that the discipline and profession still do not have gender parity. Despite this, the percentage of female faculty members in the SoA is relatively high. For adjunct and part -time faculty, we also have increased the number of women and other underrepresented groups. We were able to hire a fo reign -born Asian female post - doc for a two -year term. (The post doc is a revolving position in the CA+P and cu rrently is hosted in the City & Metropolitan Planning D epartment.) Since the last review, our pool of \"regular\" adjuncts (those who consistently teach at least one course annually) has diversified , especially regarding the number of women. We currently hav e 20 regular adjuncts teaching architecture courses. Of those faculty members, 20% are non -white with 12 (60%) men (10 white and two U.S.-born Asian), and eight (40%) women (six white, one foreign -born Asian, and one of two or more races). We continue to work to increase diversity within our adjunct teaching pool. In the last three years, the regular adjunct faculty that we have hired to teach architecture courses are two -to-one female to male (four wome n: three white and one Asian) and two men (both white).

In recognition of their efforts, faculty have received the following awards for teaching: National teaching a wards Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture New Faculty Teaching Award : Erin Carraher Building Technology Educators' Society Emerging Faculty Award : Erin Carraher University of Utah teaching awards Distinguished Innovation and I mpact Award, Jim Agutter Early Career Teaching Award: Jim Agutter, Erin Carraher, Lisa R. Teaching Mira Locher, Robert Young Public Service Professor Appreciation: Mira Locher Unive Young University Professorship: Mira Locher (with Keith Bartholomew) Within the College of Architecture + Planning, excellent teaching is recognized by the annual CA+P Professor of the Year Award. Faculty also regularly apply for and receive university teaching grants to build new course content or enhance teaching and learning in the classroom. Recipients of teaching grants include: Jim Agutter, Rima Ajlouni, Jos\u00e9 Galarza, Lisa Locher, Patrick Tripeny, Robert Young, and Shundana Yusaf . The School of Architecture is committed to various areas of university teaching, including Bachelor Degree Requirements (BD), C ommunity Engaged L earning (CEL) , General Education (GE) , Honors , and Sustainability teaching (SUSC/SUSL) . We actively seek BD, CEL, GE, and SUSC /SUSL course , both inside the major and pre -major. Additionally, we teach a set of two core interdisciplinary Honors courses in the College, which are co -taught by an architect and a planner. In total, in pre -major or non -major courses (those courses that are open to any student at the University) , the SoA offers one course with the CEL designation (as well as one within the architecture major and one grad uate - level ), two courses with SUSC/SUSL designations (and one within the University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 38 architecture major) , four courses with GE designations (FF (2), AS , and BF/HF) , and one with a BD designation (IR, as well as four within the major [QI (2), DV, and CW]) . SoA faculty also are actively involved in teaching in other departments, including Asian Studies, City & Metropolitan Planning, Gender Studies, and Religious Studies. Additionally, Professor Patrick Tripeny serves as the Director of the Center for Teaching and Lear ning Excellence at the University. 2.4 Faculty scholarship See Appendix D for Academic Analytics data related to faculty research productivity. The data from Academic Analytics demonstrates the SoA's productivity and strength in faculty scholarship. Compared to 95 schools of architecture nationwide, we exceed the national median in the quantity of books, articles, citations, grants, and awards. Of the 26 total data points (four for books, five for art icles, six for citations, seven for grants, and four for awards), we exceed the national areas and well exceed (by 20 points or more) in 12 areas. See Appendix M for a summary of past and projected faculty research and scholarship/ creative activities by full -time instructional faculty since January 2012 . Faculty in the SoA have access to fellowship and grant funding through a variety of School, College, and University channels, as well as external funders. The SoA provides travel grants fo r faculty attending academic conferences in which they give a presentation. There is no stated cap for tenure -track faculty; tenured faculty receive up to $1,500 per academic year. In fall 2015, the College initiated an externally peer - reviewed $10,000 Scholarship Incentive Program (SIP) for faculty to support interdisciplinary scholarly work that furthers the vision of the College; and the following year the College initiated a second externally peer -reviewed $10,000 SIP grant, this one focused on interdis ciplinary community engaged work. This is in addition to professional development opportunities including conference travel support and scholarship workshops hosted by the C ollege's Associate Dean for Research and Community Engagement. Faculty research i n the SoA is highly diverse, with orientations in sustainability/ resilience, history/theory, professional practice and leadership, building construction, and social justice/community engagement. While the funding available through university sources, the CA+P SIP grants and from the SoA for conference travel is helpful, given the range of research areas in the SoA, some faculty have greater access to grants than others. For example, faculty find it difficult to find funding for projects that do not fall un der the STEM category ( e.g., architectur al history research ). Most University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 39 scholars in the SoA have learned to \"make do\" with small amounts of funding, to combine research with conference travel, etc. It is not the ideal situation, but it is typical for architectural researchers. Despite the deficiency of available funding, t he SoA has a strong record of research productivity (as seen in the Academ ic Analytics data in Appendix D). This strength in research also is indicated by the number of important national awards won by faculty, listed below. Architectural Research Centers Consortium New Researcher Award (Rima Ajlouni, 2011 -12) Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture Collaborative Practice Award (Erin Carraher and J\u00f6rg R\u00fcgemer , 2014 ) Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture Creative Achievement Award (J\u00f6rg R\u00fcgemer, 2010 -11) Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture Diversity Achievement Award (Erin Carraher and J\u00f6rg R\u00fcgemer , 2014 ) Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture Creative Achievement Award (Jim Agutter and Julio Bermudez , 2005) In addition, the School of Architecture annually produc es the international peer - reviewed journal, Dialectic , published by ORO Editions (http://dialectic.cap.utah.edu/ ). In a spirit true to dialectical thinking, the journal brings together the most compelling opposing voices in the discipline today on issues, values, methods , and debates most important to the community of educators at the University of Utah and abroad. Dialectic supports the most cutting edge scholarship on the issues at hand. Seven volumes have been published, and the call for papers for the Dialectic VIII currently is in the works. The previous volumes are listed below. Dialectic I: Essays, Conversations, and Student Work (2013) Dialectic II: Architecture between Boom and Bust (2014) Dialectic III: Dream of Building or the Reality of Dreaming (2015) Diale ctic IV: Architecture at Service (2016) Dialectic V: The of Vernacular in Architectural Imagination (2017) Dialectic VI: Craft: The Art of Making Architecture (2018) Dialectic VII : Architecture and Citizenship (2019) University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 40 2.5 Faculty service School of Architecture faculty, overall, are v ery invested in service to the U niversity and local and professional communities. The SoA has five standing committees (Academic Culture and Outreach; Admissions, Recruiting, and Diversity; Curriculum; Policy and Grievance; and SoA Leadership), in addition to the required RPT Committee . Committee membership and general charges can be found in the Faculty and Staff handbook as a link from the SoA website ( http://soa.cap.utah.edu/wp - content/uploads/sites/3/2015/09/Faculty -Handbook -11-151.pdf ). Every faculty member, including regular adjuncts, sits on at least one SoA committee (excluding RPT). CA+P committees include Design Foundations, Executive, Facilities, Leadership, and RPT Guidelines (with a goal of re -writing the guidelines in the next two years). Faculty members also serve on SoA and CA+P ad hoc, search, and other short -term committees. SoA faculty also are involved in a great number of university committees, including Academic Appeals, Academic Senate, Bennion Center (various), Campus P lanning, Campus Tobacco Policy Review B oard, Faculty of Color, Global Health Steering Committee, Global U Council, Presidential Anti -Racism Task Force, Public Art Advisory , Research, Sustainabil ity Education Advisory , Undergraduate Council, Undergraduate Studies (Learning Portfolios), University General Education Curriculum Council , University Sustainability , University Asia Campus (UAC) Executive Leadership Team, University Museum of Fine Arts Advisory , University Neighborhood Partners, UPTAC, Women/Womyn/Womxn of Color Academics, and others. Faculty also regularly serve as program reviewers for the Graduate C ouncil and as building design reviewers for Campus Planning and Design. Typical academic service for SoA faculty include peer review for manuscripts, journal articles, and conference papers; invited studio reviewer at other schools of architecture ; conference organizer ; juror for design awards; RPT reviewer for other universities ; and visiting team member for architectural accreditation. Professional service includes membership on boards and committees for the American Institute of Architects (stat e and national) , ASSIST (SLC), Association for Preservation Technology International , Building Technology Educators' Society (national), Women in Architecture ( state ), International Council on Monuments and Sites, Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Program (regional), National Architectural Accrediting Board, National Conference on the Beginning Design Student, National Council of Architectural Registration Boards, National Council for Preservation Education , Public Interest Design University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 41 Institute (national), United States Green Building Council (state) , Utah State Judicial Facilities Planning Committee (state), and Vernacular Architecture Forum (local). Important c ommunity service by SoA faculty includes the Catholic Diocese Building Board, Consortium for Dark Skies Studies, Girl Scouts of Utah, KCPW Board , Utah Heritage Foundation, Salt Lake City & County Building Conservancy and Use Committee, and Utah Film Center . A number of SoA faculty have been recognized for their serv ice from the University of Utah and professional organizations. Awards received by SoA faculty include the University of Utan Beacons of Excellence (Jim Agutter), Bennion Center Public Service Professorship (Erin Carraher), Utah Heritage Foundation Lucybeth Rampton Award (Robert Young), University of Utah Distinguished Service Professor (Robert Young) . Because of the few number of career -line, tenure -track, and tenured faculty in the School of Architecture and the relatively large percentage of faculty involved in University -level administration ( currently including Jim Agutter, Martha Bradley, and Patrick Tripeny and previously also including Mira Locher and Ryan Smith ), all faculty have a heavy service load, which at times can negatively affect faculty morale. The weight of that service lo ad has been exacerbated in the last two years, as we have focused on re -imagining our undergraduate and graduate curricula. While exciting, this requires additional meetings and collaborative preparation of new course materials. 2.6 Faculty review and promotion See Appendix E for RPT guidelines. Faculty mentoring within the SoA occurs both formally and informally. When a tenure - track assistant professor is hired, they are assigned a mentor from the tenured faculty. Mentors and mentees arrange times to meet to discuss strategies for research, teaching, and service. Typically , the Dean or Chair also meets with the faculty to discuss the working s of the College, such as budgets, committees, teaching, research, and service expectations, as well as the tenure process. The Chair also meets individually with all faculty (including adjun cts) at least once per year to discuss teaching and RPT/ PTR progress and maintains an open -door policy for faculty. More informally, tenure -track faculty are encouraged to meet with tenured faculty as often as they wish, and tenured faculty welcome the opportunity to discuss research and teaching questions.

Studen ts 3.1 Student recruitment As noted in Section 1.2, from 2015 -16 the CA+P instituted a comprehensive regional recruitment plan (see CA+P Recruitment Plans in Appendix I), which includes visiting regional universities and community colle ges to meet with prospective students and to update and expand articulation agreements . Additionally, the plan calls for studying the potential results of changing the prerequisite mathematics class to trigonometry from calculus, which has been identified as a current barrier to entry for many students. The initial results of this study by the SoA Curriculum Committee led to the conclusion that the calculus requirement is necessary as it proves students are able to visualize multivariable functions, a criti cal thought process required for understanding architectural structures. However, the curriculum committee continues to explore this question. While the visits by faculty and recruitment specialists to meet with prospective students in the region and the expansion of articulation agreements has increased the visibility of the SoA's programs, it has not led to a great increase in applications to the architecture major or graduate programs. For the undergraduate program, the most effective recruitment tool i s our new Design Foundations program (see Number 5 in S ection 1.3). This interdisciplinary set of courses together with peer mentoring and dedicated student success staff has led to a significant increase in pre -major students in the CA+P. To build on this exciting first -year experience, we now are working on second -year experiences that will further engage students in our College. For example, in fall 2018 we are piloting a study abroad semester in Volterra, Italy, geared toward sophomore students in architecture, design, and urban ecology. For graduate student recruitment, as of summer 2018, the CA+P has retained an outside recruitment consultant (as noted in Section 1.2). With a primary focus on out -of-state students, t he goal is to increase graduate applications in architecture and urban planning by 20% annually for the next two years. This particular recruitment specialist has been used by the University of Utah's S chool of Pharmacy with great results, and we are optimistic that we will see similar results when applications are due in January 2019. Admission to the undergraduate architecture major requires the fulfillment of most of the University's General Educati on requirements (except the AS, CW, DV, and QI, which are fulfilled by major courses), as well as 19.5 credits in prerequisite courses plus calculus and physics (the IR and BF requirements are fulfilled in the prerequisite Design Foundations and architectu re courses). Our articulation agreements with Salt Lake University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 44 Community College (SLCC) and other regional universities allow students to complete many of the prerequisite courses at their home institutions prior to transferring to the University of Utah. We are working with SLCC to establish the equivalent Design Foundations program for their students, as well as to create opportunities for SLCC students to take our prerequisite courses as contract courses (where they remain enrolled as SLCC students but take these specific courses at the School of Architecture). Admission to the architecture major requires students to have completed the prerequisite courses or prove they will have completed the courses prior to the start of the fall semester. This allows transfer students to complete prerequisite coursework at the University of Utah in the summer prior to entering the major , if needed. The application to the major is available online from March 1st - April 30th, with applications, as well as an essay of motivatio n, two letters of recommendation, and a resume, due on April 30th. A digital portfolio is due on May 7th. Submitted application materials for the undergraduate major are coordinated by the Undergraduate Advisor, who together with the Chair of the SoA Admissions, Recruitment, and Diversity Committee (ARDC) reviews the files for completeness. If materials are missing, the applicant is notified by the Advisor and requested to submit the missing materials in a timely manner. Completed applications initiall y are reviewed by the Chair of the ARDC, who executes a ranking of the applicants by 1) total GPA, 2) GPA within the architecture pre-major courses , and 3) personal achievements and characteristics (PA&C). The PA&C factor pertains to a viewpoint; experience; racial, ethnic, or gender background; or other extraordinary circumstance that differs from the majority of our students and can contribute to a culturally and intellectually diverse learning community. A student's resume, letters of recommendation , and essay of motivation are used to determine this ranking. The PA&C factor allows for a holistic admissions process that directly correlates to the University 's admissions standards (http://admissions.utah.edu/apply/undergraduate/admission -standards.php ). After the ARDC Chair completes the initial ranking, committee members individually review and score each applicant's por tfolio, essay of motivation, letters of recommend ation , and PA&C. The ARDC Chair then compiles all the scores along with the initial rankings in a single spreadsheet and calculates a final comprehensive ranking. Students who score particularly high or low in each separate category are noted. The ARDC Cha ir provides this comprehensive ranking, along with recommendations for admission, marginal admission , and rejection to the SoA Chair. The SoA Chair reviews the admissions materials of students who are marginal and makes the final admissions decisions. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 45 At the graduate level, s tudents who have undergraduate pre -professional degrees in architecture from the University of Utah or other institutions with a NAAB -accredited M.Arch program or students from intern ational five -year Bachelor of Architecture programs who are applying into our two -year M.Arch program must meet specific requirements to be considered for admission . These requirements are: 1) the satisfactory completion of a pre -professional undergraduate degree, 2) a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.0 o r better, and 3) the completion of the general test (verbal, quantitative, and analytical) of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). In addition to the items noted above, applicants must submit the followin g required admission materials by January 1 0th: 1) an essay of motivation, 2) three letters of recommendation (with at least two from studio professors, the third can be from an employer or member of the professional community), 3) a full resume, 4) a digital portfolio, 5) an unofficial transcript from each institution attended (official transcripts are required upon admittance), 6) an online graduate admissions application, and 7) an application fee. Starting in January 2019, the SoA will waive the application fee for any student submitting an application by the January 10th deadline and also will consider applications submitted after the deadline. Students matriculating into our two -year graduate program with an undergraduate degree from another institution are required to provide syllabi for all courses taken at their previous university that they propose be used to fulfill requisite courses in our undergraduate program that meet NAAB's Student Performance Criteria (SPC). Each course syllabus is reviewed thoroughly by the SoA Chair or the Chair of the Admissio ns, Recruiting, and Diversity Committee in consultation with the faculty who teach in those areas. If insufficient evidence is found, the Chair may request additional information about the course content (including examples of student work) or deem it not equivalent. If a course is deemed inequivalent, the student is required to enroll in the course within our program that addresses the NAAB criteria in question and pass it with a satisfactory grade (B - or better). The SoA maintains a file for each student who matriculates from another undergraduate architecture program tracking their particular SPC fulfilment. For students who wish to enroll in the M.Arch 3+ program and who have undergraduate degrees in subjects other than architecture or BA or BS degrees in architecture from universities without NAAB -accredited M.Arch programs, the admissions requirements include that a pplicants must demonstrate that they have successfully completed or will successfully complete by the time of admittance: 1) a Bachelor's degree from a regionally -accredited college or university with an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better, 2) course work in calculus and physics, and 3) the general test (verbal, quantitative, and analytical) of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). 3+ applicants al so must submit the following required admission materials by January 1 0th: 1) an essay of motivation, 2) University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 46 three letters of recommendation (with at least one from a professor, the other two can be from employers or members of the professional community), 3) a full resume, 4) a digital portfolio, 5) an unofficial transcript from each institution attended (official transcripts are required upon admittance), 6) an online graduate admissions application, and 7) an application fee. As with the two -year applicants, the application fee will be waived if the application is complete on or before January 10th. While a dvanced standing is not an option in the M.Arch two-year program, i n the 3+ program, a student may qualify for advanced standing (which may eliminate the requirement for taking courses during the initial summer semester), if the student produces a portfolio of studio work that proves advanced understanding of archite ctural design. Such students are not required to take the initial 6 -credit summer studio bu t must complete all other requirements for the 3+ program. Course equivalency, inequivalency, advanced standing, and all related documentation are recorded in the student's admission file. Similar to the process for entry into the undergraduate major described above, submitted application materials for both the two -year and 3+ M.Arch degree programs are coordinated by the SoA Administrative Officer/Graduate Advisor, who together with the Chair of the Admissions, Recruitment, and Diversity Committee (ARDC) reviews the files for completeness. If materials are missing, the applicant is notified by the Administrative Officer and requested to submit the missing materials in a timely manner. Applications that initially are incomplete are reviewed by the ARDC, provided that all materials are received prior to the early March posting of letters of acceptance, waitlist, and rejection. I n special circumstances, applications may be reviewed after acceptance letters have been posted. Completed applications initially are reviewed by the Chair of the ARDC, who executes a ranking of the applicants by 1) total GPA, 2) GPA within the architectur e major, 3) GRE score, and 4) personal achievements and characteristics (PA&C). As noted above, t he PA&C factor pertains to a viewpoint; experience; racial, ethnic, or gender background; or other extraordinary circumstance that differs from the majority of our students and can contribute to a culturally and intellectually diverse learning community. A student's resume, transcripts, and essay of motivation are used to determine this ranking. The PA&C factor allows for a holistic admissions process that direc tly correlat es to the University's admissions standards. After the ARDC Chair completes the initial ranking, committee members individually review and score each applicant's por tfolio, essay of motivation, letters of recommendation , and PA&C . Based on the se scores, committee members also note students who merit receiving scholarships or Graduate Assistantships (GA). The ARDC Chair then compiles all the scores along with the initial rankings in a single spreadsheet University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 47 and calculates a final comprehens ive ranki ng. Students who score particularly high or low in each separate category are noted, as are those who the committee has indicated to be particularly worthy of receiving a scholarship and/or GA. The ARDC Chair provides this comprehensive ranking, along with recommendations for admission, admission with advanced standing (for 3+ students only, as described above ), marginal, and rejection to the SoA Chair. The SoA Chair reviews the admissions materials of students who are marginal and makes the final admission s decisions. Student retention in both the undergraduate major and the graduate program is generally very high. Because our programs offer a high faculty -to-stude nt ratio (particularly with studio courses), faculty get to know students well, and students get to know each other well. This sense of community is an important element of the SoA and a key factor in student retention. End -of-semester celebrations of student work, monthly Chats with the Chair, and other similar activities also add to the familial atmosphere in the S chool. Scholarships, Teaching Assistantships, and Graduate Assistantships play an important role in retention, particularly for out -of-state and international students. While our level of scholarship funding for undergraduate students is low (we offer about $3,000 in undergraduate scholarships annually), our graduate funding is more robust. We endeavo r to offer scholarships, TA positions, and GA position s at the rate that triggers the Graduate Tuition Benefit, as we know that this leve l of su pport is especially significant for our students (out -of-state and international students in particular). Please see Section s 1.3 and 3.4 for more details on student support. Student professional development and opportunit ies also are integral to retention. To that end, the CA+P is a series sponsor of the AIA Utah Young Architects' Forum \"Meet the Masters\" series, which connects students and emerging professionals with practitioners identified as \"masters\" in their field to discuss the ir professional experience. Addi tionally, the College support s the SoA's membership as a Collegiate Associate of the AIAS, enhancing the ability of our AIAS chapter to leverage their resources for professional development activities. The local chapter of W omen in Architects hosts luncheons at the SoA and speed mentoring sessions, as well as provides small scholarships to all new female graduate students. 3.2 Student diversity Attracting a diverse pool of architecture students continues to be a challenge, as the profession of architecture remains primarily white and male. Data shows that nationwide about 42% of students in schools of architecture are female , less than 25% of architecture employees are female, and only about 13% of AXP supervisors (licensed University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 48 architects who supervise architectural interns' required hours for the Architectural Experience Program) are female (see http://www.acsa -arch.org/resources/data - resources/wo men ). While data from 1992 -2016 shows a larger gender gap in undergraduate students studying architecture than in graduate students (http://www.acsa -arch.org/images/default -source/atlas/atlas2018_06final.jpg?sfvrsn=0 ), we find that the percentage of female students in both our undergraduate and graduate programs averages to about 30% (from 2011 -2017). While there is a general trend toward more female students in the undergraduate program (from a low of 17% in 2011 to a high of 40% in 2017), the number of women in the graduate program has hover ed between 24% and 36%, without any obvious trend. Available data shows the national averages fo r the number of non -white, non -resident alien architecture students has grown from about 28% in 2010 to about 33% In the SoA we see a slight trend toward a higher percentage of non-white students in both our undergraduate and graduate programs. From 2011 -2017 the average percent of non -whit e students in the undergraduate program was 36% (higher than the national average) and 24% in the graduate program (lower than the national average) . In both programs, we see the largest percentage of domestic non - white students identifying as Hispanic/Latino (14% in our undergraduate program and 6% in the graduate program), with a general trend toward increasing numbers in both programs . Given the well -documented increase in the Latino population in the Salt Lake area, we expect these numbers to continue t o increase. For non -resident alien students (our second highest non -white student population in architecture), national d ata shows a mostly steady increase in international students in architectural education from 2009 see a different trend. Non -resident alien students make up an average (based on data from 2011 -2017) of 11% of our undergraduate architecture students and 10% of architecture graduate students. While we see many graduate architecture programs in the U.S. with very high percentages of international s tudents (especially from China), we are not seeing similar numbers. In addition to our general recruiting efforts noted in the previous section, we work to educate potential students about the discipline and profession of architecture through educational outreach programs with organizations like University Neighborhood Partners, the Girl Scouts, and the Sorenson Unity Center, as well as meeting students from Salt Lake Community College and inviting them to visit our S chool (which they do annually). We also run architecture Summer Discovery camps for middle schoolers University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 49 through high school students, and in summer 2018 the SoA raised scholarships to help four students from the Navajo Nation attend a week -long camp. We plan to continue to increase this type of outreach, as we know that creating a personal connection to a prospective student can be very instrumental in that student's decision to study architecture.

With our new curriculum, students also must complete two arch itectural history courses, but we have replaced the physics II pre -requirement with an in -major course. Students also must apply to enter the major, as per the procedure noted in Section 3.1. In general, the SoA faculty feel that the admissions process to the major is an important threshold for our students. That said, we rely on a convention al (though perhaps outdated) model for admitting students into the major. Given the increased number of students in our Design Foundations program in both the first yea r of the program (2017 -18) and the current year, we expect to see a significant increase in undergraduate applicants starting in spring 2019 . Our advisors have identified physics and calculus as the two courses which most hinder students and limit the appl icants to the major, as often students are placed in academic tracks in middle and high school , which give them very little preparation for college -level mathematics. When those students discover a passion for architecture, they often have to take multiple math courses before they can take calculus. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 51 Given our newly imagined curriculum that emphasizes an ethical framework around social equity, it is an appropriate time for us to reconsider how we complete undergraduate admissions. The SoA Admissions, Recrui ting, and Diversity committee has been charged with starting this process during the 2018 -19 academic year. In our graduate program, the majority of our students (approximately 80% on average) come from our undergraduate architecture major. In recent yea rs, the students who come from other U.S. undergraduate programs are from colleges and universities such as Brigham Young University, Dixie State , Kent State, Miami University of Ohio, Ohio State, Santa Barbara City College, Snow College, South Dakota State University, United State Naval Academy, University of California, University of Cincinnati, University of Florida, University of Idaho, University of Wisconsin -Milwaukee, Utah State University (USU) , and Utah Valley University (UVU) , and many of our students have attended a combination of schools, such as UVU, USU, and SLCC. Based on data from 2011 -18 in Table 3. 3, despite a decrease in the number of applicants, the average GPA for admitted graduate students has held steady, as has the average GRE test score . Please note that prior to the application process for fall 2014, the GRE test was not required. Table 3.3: Graduate Admissions Data School of Architecture - 2011 -2017 Academic Year Students Applied Students Admitted Number of Students who Applied to Graduate Programs Average Overall GPA Average Overall GRE Score Number of Students Admitted to Graduate Programs Average Overall GPA Average Overall GRE Score 2017-18 48 3.42 152/149/3.6 44 150/152/3.7 42 2014-15 n/a 68 3.47 n/a University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 52 3.4 Student support Student support comes in the form of Teaching A ssistantships, Graduate A ssistantships, grant support, and scholarships. Increasing student support has been a major focus for the Dean of the College since his arrival in fall 2014 . In FY15 $94,500 was available for Graduate A ssistantships . Due to a Dean's Initiative, from FY16 the School of Architecture received additional funding, making a total of $144,000 available for Teaching Assistant and Gradua te Assistant positions . Semester -length Teaching A ssistantships, Graduate A ssistantships, and scholarships typically are offered at the amount that triggers the Tuition Benefit Program (currently $3,875). Graduate Assistant positions are used mostly for recruitment - to attract high - quality out -of-state students to the 3+ and two -year programs. As noted in S ection 1.2, since spring 2016 we have been able to add $30,000 to fund seven new Graduate Assistantships. These positions are designed for students to work with faculty or CA+P staff on special projects, such as curriculum, events, and public relations. Top candidates may receive a GA position for both fall and spring semester s or a combination of a GA positio n and a scholarship , in order to qualify for the Tuition Benefit Program both semesters . Scholarships are used for recruiting new graduate students and for aiding continuing students, especially out -of-state and international students who excel in the pr ogram. Although the number of scholarships in the SoA has increased since the prior Graduate Council Review, the number is still limited (currently 21 in total, not all at the amount required for the Tuition Benefit Program). T he SoA Chair tries to spread out the scholarships among the worthy recipients , based on recommendations from the ARDC . Only rarely is a student offered a scholarship for both semesters in an academic year. It is more typical for a student to receive a scholarship for one semester and a GA or TA position for the other. The SoA has eight endowed scholarships and 13 renewable firm - sponsored scholarships for a total amount of $131,000 (including $15,000 first made available by the Dean in FY16 through a matching program for new scholarship s with the UofU Graduate School). Teaching Assistantships are awarded based on overall GPA and the student's knowledge of and interest in the course topic. Typically, TA positions are filled by incoming two -year M.Arch students who completed their undergraduate degree in our program (and therefore are familiar with the undergraduate courses that they may TA) or by students in their second year of the graduate program (either the 3+ or two -year) , so that faculty have a sense of a student's ability . Student s are asked to complete a TA application and may choose to note specific courses of interest or faculty with whom they would like to University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 53 work. The SoA Administrative Officer and Chair then work together, in consultation with faculty whose courses have TAs (par ticularly for courses which require a good grasp of a specialized topic, such as structures and history/theory/criticism), to determine which students receive TA positions. As noted previously, f or the 2018 -19 academic year, 93% of students requesting a TA position were awarded at least a one -semester position, with 30% of those students awarded a TA or GA position both semesters and another 30% awarded a TA or GA position one semester and a scholarship the second semester. (Students who did not receive T A or GA positions had GPAs below th e minimum threshold.) This is an increase from 75% of students who requested a TA or GA position receiving a position in 2016 -17. Grant support for both undergraduate and graduate students stems primarily from faculty members with external grants that provide student research positions. These positions mostly go to upper level undergraduates and graduate students. Most of these position are paid hourly, with typical wages in the $15 -20/hour range. Students in our program very rarely apply for funding from external fellowships, as they typically do not perform their own fundable research in the program. All in all, st udent support in the School increased almost 33 percent from FY2015 to FY2016 and has held steady since that time . Financial support for specific projects and opportunities for students in the accredited program also is available through other University channels, such as the Sustainability Office's Sustainable Campus Initiative Fund, the Office for Global Engagement Scholarships, and the LGBT Resource Center Scholarship Fund. Architecture graduate students in their final year also can apply for the annual Bailey Travel Fellowship, a competitive endowed fell owship which provides about $3,5 00 in f unding for one successful student. The student must organize a travel plan around a research question of their choice and submit the plan with a budget and explanation to a group of former recipients who select the winning submission. An additional endowed competitive travel scholarship that will provide funding for a graduate student whose final studio project requires travel currently is being developed. 3.5 Student advising Academic advising is available from faculty in addition to the professional advisors in both the School and College, as well as by University advisors (including a U niversity Career C oach who spends four hours per week in the architecture building) . Our CA+P Student Success Team includes one recruitment specialist and two undergraduate advisors, one who focuses on pre -major students, and the other who focuses on students in the majors. The SoA Administrative Officer serves as the graduate student advisor. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 54 When an undergraduate student notes interest in any program in the CA+P, that student is contacted by our pre -major advisor, who invites the student for an advising session. The student then becomes part of the Design Foundations (DF) cohort and is invited to special events and mentoring sessions with the advisors an d peer mentors. DF students are introduced to the CA+P Dean and Chairs early on, so that they are made to feel part of the College community. Advisors work closely together and with the Chairs to ensure that students receive the advising they need (with a minimum of one face -to-face meeting annual ly). Graduate advising begin s with the Graduate Experience Open House in late March for admitted students. Before the start of the fall semester, incoming and returning graduate students receive a welcome letter , letting them know of the courses available to them in the upcoming semester and inviting them to meet with the Graduate Advisor with any questions. The Graduate Advisor meets with students at least on ce per year but more typically once per semester, to en sure they are meeting all the graduation requirements. If a student has an unusual situation, the Graduate Advisor and SoA Chair work together to determine the best course of action for the student. Because our program is relatively small, it is easy for t he Graduate Advisor, Chair, and faculty to get to know the students well and to make sure they stay on track to graduate with their cohort. While the students receive excellent advising from the Student Success Team, it is clear that at the undergraduate level, with the increasing numbers of Design Foundations students, the advising staff is stretched thin. Having an additional advisor to help with undergraduate majors would be beneficial to the College, although funding for such a position currently does not exist in the College budget. Additiona lly, a dedicated Graduate Advisor for the College is needed, as currently the SoA and CMP Administrative Officers also serve as the Graduate Advisors. The SoA Student Handbook provides an important opportunity for communication with students on the mission of the S chool; the goals of each degree we offer; SoA, College, and University academic policies (including the appeals policy) ; the Studio Culture Policy; and the organization and opportunities for student governance of the College (http://soa.cap.utah.edu/student -handbook/ ). In addition , the hensive list of SoA, CA+P, and U niversity facilities, such as the shop, plotters, and digital fabrication equipment ; additional campus resources for digital fabrication; libraries and research facilities and services; IT services; health and wellness resources; academic resources such as t he Writing Center and the Office of Learning Abroad; student academic policies; campus and local emergency services; and contact University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 55 information for the local design and arts community. The Handbook was most recently updated prior to the start of the fall 2018 semester. In addition to the University Career Coach who assists students to find internships and other employment, t he CA+P helps to place students in professional internships and employment by sponsorin g an annual Career Fair and connecting students w ith information on available jobs through posters and email announcements. The SoA website provides links to information on the path to becom ing a licensed architect and to associated professional organizations. A member of the faculty, who is a licensed practicing architect , serves as the Architect Licensing Advisor (ALA) for the School. The ALA conducts an annual workshop on the training and examination requirements for architecture licensure that is open to the entire student body and faculty. The workshop includes representatives from the Young Architects Forum, the State Architect Licensing Advisor, and interns who either are taking the licensing exam currently or recently have completed them . The workshop agenda includes a summary of why to get licen sed, the internship and licensing process, navigating the NCARB website, license reciprocity, and alternative practices. The Utah State Architectural Licensing Board provides a unique incentive for students by waiving the first $100 of the registration fee and deferring the balance until graduation. Registration for this program is conducted at the ALA workshop. 3.6 Teaching assistant (TA) training All Teaching Assistants in the School of Architecture are required to attend either the Annual Teachin g Symposium organized by the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence or the SoA's TA training. The SoA TA training takes place on the Friday before the first week of classes in the fall semester and in addition to the training for the TAs, incorporat es time for TAs and faculty to meet. The TA training includes an overview of the curriculum; tips for interacting with faculty; training on transparent teaching, creating a positive and respectful classroom atmosphere, and getting students involved in classroom discussions; discussion on issues that may arise and how to deal with them (including both academic and sexual misconduct); and guidance for assessing student work. Ongoing supervision of TAs is the responsibility of the faculty member with whom the st udent works. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 56 International students typically do not receive TA positions during their first year in the SoA (they may receive GA positions or scholarships instead), in order for the faculty to assess their language ability. By the second year of the graduate program, most international students have the language capability to succeed as a TA. International students are required to participate in the International Teaching Assistant Program (ITAP), which prepares non -native English speakers to hold TA positions through training in English as a second language and on the U.S. educational system . University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 57 4. Curriculum and Programs of Study 4.1 Degree and certificate requirements The School of Architecture offers four degrees: Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies (BSAS) - approved by the Board of Regents in 1990 , Bache lor of Science in Multi -Disciplinary Design (BSD) - approved by the Board of Regents in 2013 , Mast er of Ar chitecture (M.Arch) - established in 1949 and approved by the Board of Regents in 1976 -77, and Master of Science in Architectural Studies (MSAS) - approved by the Board of Regents in 1992 -93 (currently not active ly promoted ); two graduate certificates which include coursework in the SoA Historic Preservation (HP) - approved by the Board of Trustees in 2006, and Urban Design (UD) - approved by the Board of Trustees in 201 1; and one certificate without coursework in the SoA (and not based in the CA+P) : Real Estate Development (RED) - approved by the Board of Trustees in 2009 . Graduate architecture students also have the option of two dual degrees: Master of Architecture and Master of Science in Architectural Studies (M.Arch/MSAS) - approved by the Boa rd of Trustees in 2014 (currently not actively promoted), and Master of Architecture and Master of Real Estate Development (M.Arch/MRED) - approved by the Board of Trustees in 2014. The BSAS degree program with the current (old) curriculum requires 12 cre dits of prerequisite course work plus calculus (4 credits) and physics I and II (8 credits) and 52 credits in the major. The new BSAS curriculum requires 26.5 credits of prerequisite work (including Design Foundations) plus calculus (4 credits) and physics I (4 credits) and 51 credits in the major. The BSD degree program requires 79 credits of coursework plus physics I (4 credits) and is administered independently by the Multi -Disciplinary Design program . The two -year M.Arch degree program with the current (old) curriculum requires a total of 53 credits; the new two -year curriculum requires 59 credits of coursework. The 3+ M.Arch degree program with the current (old) curriculum requires a total of 100 credits; the new two -year curriculum requires 101 credits of coursework. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 58 The MSAS degree program requires 36 credits of coursework. This degree currently is not active ly promoted due to low enrollment in recent years. Once the new M.Arch curriculum transition is complete, the SoA will revisit this degree program . The dual M.Arch/MSAS requires a total of 83 credits, and up to 12 credits from the M.Arch can be applied toward the MSA S. The dual M .Arch/MRED requires a total of 89 credits, and up to 12 credits from the M.Arch can be applied toward the MRED. The Graduate Certificate in Historic Preservation requires 15 credits, and elective coursework in the M.Arch can be used toward the HP certificate. The Graduate Certificate in Urban Design requires 17 credits, and elective coursework in the M.Arch can be used toward the UD certificate. The Graduate Certificate in Real Estate Development requires 18 credits, and elective coursew ork in the M.Arch can be used toward the RED certificate. Please see Appendix G for short descriptions and course lists/roadmaps for each of the degree and certificate programs.

The SoA offers no online courses at this time. Please see Appendix L for the School of Architecture's curricular management plan. 4.3 Programs of study See Appendix G for examples of programs of study . 4.4 Professiona l development for students Professional Practice courses are a required element of an accredited architecture program. The following five Student Performance Criteria related to professional development are outlined by the National Architectural Accrediting Board and are met in the graduate professional practice sequence (ARCH 6700 and ARCH 6701). D.1 Stakeholder Roles in A rchitec ture: Understanding of the relationshi ps among key stakeholders in the design process - client, contractor, a rchitec t, user grou ps, local comm unity - and the a rchitec t's role to reconcile stakeholder needs. D.2 Project Ma nagem ent: Understand ing of the m ethods for selectin g consulta nts and a ssemb ling teams; i dentifying work pl ans, projec t schedu les, and time r equirem ents; and recomm ending project deliver y method s. D.3 Business Practices: Understanding of the basic principl es of a firm's business practic es, including financial m anage ment and eting, eneu Understand ing of the architect's res ponsibility to th e public and the client as determi ned by r egulati ons and legal consider ations invo lving the practice ntracts . D.5 Profe ssional Understand ing of the ethical i ssues involv ed in the exercise of professional judgm ent in architectural design and practice a nd unde rstandi ng the role of the NCARB Rules of Conduct and the AIA C ode of Ethics in de fining profe ssional condu ct. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 60 The NCARB (National Council of Architectural Registration Boards) Rules of Conduct (https://www.ncarb.org/sites/default/files/Rules_of_Conduct.pdf ) and the AIA (American Institute of Arc hitects) cut_033017.pdf ) are the professional standard s for practicing architects. In addition to this core coursework in the graduate program, a new undergraduate Professional Practice course is planned for fall 2019. This course will focus on leadership and collaboration in architectural practice. 4.5 Outreach education The SoA currently has no outreach education, although our students do have the opportunity to study for a semester at a remote location (Bluff, UT, and Volterra, Italy) with SoA faculty. Because these programs are organized and run by the SoA/CA+P, there is no ne ed for contractual oversight regarding faculty, curriculum, and credits. Students in both off -site locations have access to the University through the internet. While some students in Volterra currently are attending architecture courses remotely (using Sk ype or similar), the goal for that program (as it is for the DesignBuildBLUFF program) is to have all coursework available on site, without any need for remote access to instruction. 4.6 Qualifying exams N/A No qualifying exams are required for either the Master of Architecture or Master of Science in Architectural Studies degrees. 4.7 Final Studio P rojects See Appendix H for sample abstracts and images from recent M.Arch final studio projects and MSAS final projects . Rather than completing a thesis as the capstone for the M.A rch degree, students are required to complete a final studio project. This design -based project is in keeping with the expectations of the NAAB (our accrediting body) and typical practice at other professional schools of architecture. Since the last review in 2011 -12, these final projects have been completed within a faculty -driven studio context. The faculty in charge of the final studio together with the students choos e one or more cities to study. The cities are selected based on student University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 61 interest as well as faculty knowledge and contacts, so that faculty can determine specific site areas within the cities, and students are able to travel to the cities and meet with local architects and planners to better understand the city context and local issues. Often alumni living in the selected city assist with general site selection and research. Whenever possible - and particularly for sites outside of the U.S., the site selection is connected to the content of another course, allowing students to have even greater in - depth knowledge of a country. For example, in 2013 -14, 2015 -16, and 2017 -18, si tes in Japan were used and the students basing their pro jects in Japan traveled there as part of a course on materials and construction technology in Japanese architecture. In 2016 -17, a site in China was selected, and students using that site traveled to China as part of a Chinese architectural history course. While the general site within each city is determined by the faculty, students must select a particular building site based on in-person site research. Students also develop a particular building p rogram (function) based on their research and site visits. Table 4.1 lists the selected cities and final studio instructors for each year since the previous review.

Each candidate has a supervisory committee with three members (MSAS track leader, SOA Chair, and CA+P Associate Dean). Under the direction of the MSAS track leader, the student proposes an investigative study and then completes the project as a demonstration of professional skills gained from the MSAS program. The goal is to complete original research that contributes to the body of knowledge of the profession. At the conclusion of the research, the student makes a public presentation before the supervisory committee and other invited guests to demonstrate proficiency in the research method and outcome. See Table 4.2 for a list of completed an d pending MSAS projects.

Program Effectiveness - Outcomes Assessment 5.1 Learning o utcomes assessment procedures A requirement of the University is to provide Expected Learning Outcomes (ELOs) and Outcomes Assessments (OAs) for all programs of academic study as well as individual courses. As a part of our curriculum re -imagination, we are in the process of rewriting our ELOs as well as providing additional layers of assessment to ensure that the new curriculum is appropriately taught (see Appendix J for a current draft of our program ELOs). In addition to tracking student information (recruitment, quality of students, retention, graduation rates), and employer satisfaction (through our advisory committee, extensive contact with and surveys of our professional community, and the participation of local professionals in the review of student work throughout the semester), the data and information sources used to assess outcomes include year -end individual student exit surveys conducted by the Chair, online evaluations of all courses (administered by the University), surveys completed by jurors for the final capstone studio s, and the end - of-semester all -faculty reviews of student work. Additionally, in February and March 2014, in preparation for our curriculum re -imagination project, then SoA Associate Chair Mimi Locher conducted four discussions - one each with members of t he professional community, students, faculty, and adjunct faculty - to define the \"ideal Utah architectural graduate.\" In addition, with the new curriculum we are in the process of formalizing our semester assessments of ELOs by incorporating our end -of-semester all -faculty reviews into a two - phase assessment process in which we assess ELOs at the beginning of each semester and then use the faculty review to gather, analyze, and interpret evidence of actual outcomes. The following proposal is a draft that will be vetted by the faculty during the 2018 -19 academic year . Assessing Expected Learning Outcomes Before the beginning of each semester, department faculty and instructors will provide the Chair with syllabi for the courses they will teach. The Chair then will organize a workshop in which faculty are grouped according to their areas of expertise. Groups will evaluate the syllabi based on the mapping of objectives as developed in the new curriculum. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 64 The working groups will: 1) discuss how to map specific expected learning outcomes onto courses based on the new curriculum/objective plans; 2) identify gaps in how current course offerings fulfill learning outcomes across their area; and 3) make proposals to the faculty on how to fill those gaps and further develop their syllabi. In the course of teaching and student assessment, faculty will evaluate whether learning outcomes have been met and bring this analysis to the end -of-semester retreat. AND Systematically Gathering, Analyzing, and Interpreting Evidence Taking into consideration the program's professional accreditation process for evaluating student performance, the faculty has developed a feasible assessment process to provide useful ongoing feedback for necessary curricular adjustments and future resour ce planning. At the end of each semester, the faculty will perform a direct summative evaluation. Direct proof of learning is concrete, observable, clear evidence of what students have or have not learned. Summative assessment will take place after the c ompletion of each semester and be used for documenting and presenting student learning outcomes to internal and/or external stakeholders. The process will entail staggering the assessment of one or two student learning outcomes per semester over a three -semester period. Each semester, appraisal of the selected learning outcomes will occur through an end -of-semester retreat in which student work for specific courses that are expected to cover the selected learning outcome will be presented and assessed by the full faculty. Faculty teaching courses selected for review will present examples of both low and high achieving student projects as well as their grading rubrics for assessment and discussion. In addition to quantitative evaluation from grading rubrics, this entails employing a qualitative analysis that is more flexible and naturalistic in searching for recurring patterns and themes. The goal is not precision in measurement but truthful information about what students have learned and how it is manifest in the design, communication, and analysis of their projects and papers. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 65 Student learning assessment will occur after the semester is over and will be independent from the instructor's individual assessment of a student's work. To ensure further anonymity and confidentiality, the faculty presenting the work will remove students' names and any other potential identifiers from assignments. 5.2 Outcomes assessment feedback In summer 2018, the SoA Chair and Associate Chair conducted a series of tea ching development workshops for the first time to help implement the roll -out of the new curriculum. This series of four workshops was designed to enhance our innovative new undergraduate and graduate curricula, engage faculty and instructors with importan t pedagogical theories and practices, and assist them with writing syllabi and assessment rubrics to ensure that the ELOs conceived for the new curriculum were a central guiding aspect of the development of new courses. These workshops were for all SoA ten ured, tenure -track, career -line, and adjunct faculty teaching in the 2018 -19 academic year. The workshop schedule and topics were as follows: SoA Teaching Training Series, Part I : Curriculum re -imagination overview, pedagogical theories and practices (learning objectives and outcomes, transparency, accessibility, power dynamics, etc.), introduction to syllabus writing. SoA Teaching Training Series, Part II : Syllabus workshop (peer to peer review) - introduction to writing assessment rubrics. Faculty were asked to bring complete drafts of course syllabi . SoA Teaching Training Series, Part III : Assessment rubrics workshop (peer to peer review) - review of writing assessment rubrics. Faculty were asked to bring drafts of assessment rubrics for course assignments. SoA Teaching Training Series, Part IV : TA and faculty mentoring - Faculty who have a TA assigned to their course were requested to be prepared to meet with the TA (to bring a description of the TA's duties). TAs were present for TA training a nd discussion with faculty. Faculty without an assigned TA met with other faculty in their teaching area to continue curriculum discussions. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 66 Parts II and III were specifically designed to allo w for the assessment of the ELO s and their relationship to syllabus development. Overall, the teaching training series was very successful. Faculty and instructors explored the importance of ELOs for their courses, and during the training series syllabi were developed with appropriate ELOs and with projects and assign ments designed to provide students with fitting opportunities to learn and illustrate their mastery of t he ELO s. As we move forward with the new curriculum, we will continue to offer our training series. However, once the pedagogical theories and practices are fully adopted as a part of our teaching culture, the series may be less extensive and more focused on assessing the ELO s and their role in structuring syllabi and learning activities. Our end -of-semester all -faculty reviews of student work are a long -standing method of evaluating the effectiveness of our curriculum. One clear concrete example of how this method works is sequence of reviews that we conducted leading up to our most recent NAAB accreditation in 2016. We focused on particular Student Perf ormance Criteria (SPCs) required for professional accreditation for each review. This allowed the faculty to prepare for the accreditation by assigning SPCs appropriately and developing particular assignments and rubrics to ensure that student work showed evidence of meeting SPCs. Our Design Development studio was created as a direct result of this process. After evaluating student work in graduate level studios in our end -of-semester evaluation in the spring of 2015, the faculty determined that there was not adequate evidence to meet several SPCs required by NAAB. As a solution, a working group of faculty was created to design a course and a series of exercises that would allow students to show their mastery of building codes, skin assemblies, large scale wall sections, and project scheduling and delivery. In our new curriculum, this Design Development studio has developed into our Professional Integration Studio, which in the spring 2019 semester will be focused on integrating the conceptual design process and professional design development processes that allow students to understand the requisite consultation with allied trades including engineers, codes, contractors, etc. In the Professional Integration Studio, both studio and the building systems applic ation course are given equal weight and coordinated throughout the semester to ensure that students are capable of designing and developing buildings from conception to delivery. 5.3 Degree completion data See Table 5.1 for graduate degree completion/attrition d ata. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 67 The data provided by the Office of Budget and Institutional Analysis ( OBIA ) for Table 5.1 seems mostly accurate, although the number of students in cohort remaining in graduate program for 2015 -16 and 2016 -17 and the number of students in cohort who completed the master 's degree in 2016 -17 seem inaccurate (and discussions with OB IA yielded no new information on this discrepancy). The SoA experiences very low attrition in the graduate program, particularly in the two -year program and in the 3+ program after the second semester. The attrition that does occur typically happens during the first (summer) semester of the 3+ program. Please note that the data in Table 5.1 is somewhat distorted by including both the two-year and 3+ M aster of Architecture degree students in the same cohort, even though their average time to complete the master's program and their years of graduation are different. Table 5.1: Graduate Degree Completion/Attrition Data School of Architecture 2011 -2018 Entering Student Cohort Academic Year Number of students newly enrolled in master's program s Number of students in cohort who left before completing master's degree Number of students in cohort who completed master's degree Average time (in semesters) to complete master's degree * Number of students in cohort remaining in graduate programs 2011-12 41 2 39 4.9 0 2012-13 34 5 29 5.27 0 2013-14 33 3 30 5.6 0 2014-15 35 2 30 5.6 0 2015-16 32 3 29 4.3 8 2016-17 23 4 15 4.73 19 2017-18 29 0 0 0 29 *The 3+ M.A rch degree is a s even -semester program, and the two -year M.A rch is a four -semester program. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 68 5.4 Employment Data from 2015 shows that employment demand for recent architecture graduates and intern architects was good, with 98% of employers reporting moderate to very strong demand for this group nationa lly (http://www.acsa -arch.org/images/default - source/data/acsa -atlas -2015 -05.jpg?sfvrsn=0 ). Since that time, the national economy has continued to grow about 2 -2.5% annually, and average Architecture Billing Index (ABI) scores for the first part of 2017 exceeded those from the previous two years (http://www.acsa -arch.org/images/default -source/data/acsa -atlas -2015 - 05.jpg?sfvrsn=0 ). The ABI score for June 2018 showed growth for the ninth consecutive month, according to information from the American Institute of Architects (https://www.aia.org/press -releases/205031 -june -architecture -firm-billings -stay-positi 2018 will be the eigh th consecutive year of growth. Forecasts are cautiousl y optimistic, with similar growth as in 2018 projected for 2019 and 2020 (https://www.aia.org/articles/205181 -despite -emerging -economic -concerns -construc ). This trend is reiterated locally, with a March 2018 article from Utah Business stating , \"Utah's construction industry is faced with the challenge of plentiful work with no sign of slowing \" (https://utahbusiness.com/industry -outlook -construction -2/). In the \"2018 Economic Report to the Governor, \" the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute of the University of Utah states, \" Utah's construction sector posted the highest job growth in 2017, 5.4 percent, fueled by both robust residential and commercial activity. The value of permit authorized nonresidential construction was $2.4 billion in 2017 led by a record -setting $520 million in new office construction.\" The report also echoes other data sour ces by forecasting that Utah will continue to be one of the highest performing economies in the country ( http://gardner.utah.edu/economics/economic -report -to-the-governor/ ). Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics from May 2017 shows that employment for architects in Utah remains strong, with a mean salary of $63,350 and a mean hourly wage of $31.42 ( https://www .bls.gov/oes/current/oes171011.htm ). This correlates to graduate student exit interview data collected by the SoA Chair in spring 2017 and 2018. For both years the average post -graduation starting salary was $52,000 and the average hourly wage was about $18.00. In spring 2018 a ll domestic graduate students who actively sought employment had no difficulty finding a job in the Salt Lake area . As a matter of fact, the majority of domestic graduate studen ts (94% of those interviewed) were w orking an average o f 15.5 hours per week at local architecture firms during the academic year - with some students regularly working as m any as 30 hours per week . University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 69 6. Facilities and Resources 6.1 Operating budget issues The reduction in student numbers in recent years has had a negative impact on the revenue generated by differential tuition, course fees, and SCH productivity dollars. Paired with the fact that the University of Utah has one of the lowest graduate tuition rates in the PAC -12, this makes the delivery of a peer -competitive professional graduate program difficult. While we offer excellent value for a professional architecture education and intend to remain as cost -effective as possible, we do feel a budgetary strain to \"keep up\" with the top architecture schools, particularly in regard to technology and high impact student opportunities . We have been able to leverage U niversity and outside grants to purchase new equipment (such as the CNC mill) and upgrade teaching facilities an d equipment (n ew studio desks, R oom 128, Bailey Gallery acoustic retrofit, studio spaces in the Einar Nielsen Fieldhouse, etc.). However, we rely heavily on outside donors for important projects, such as the Fab Lab build -out, the Student Success Center planned for the lower level, and the much -needed future elevator to mak e our building accessible (see S ection 6.2). The growth of our pre -major Design Foundations program helps to offset the decrease in differential tuition and other income from the graduate program . This growth , together with the efforts of our recruitment consultant, bodes well for a future increase in applications to our graduate programs . However, such an increase also will result in the need for greater financial support (graduate and teaching assi stantships) , in particular to enhance diversity within our student body with greater numbers of underrepresented students as well as out -of-state and international students. It is possible that after initial funding from th e University, some of this new fi nancial support could be covered by the increase in differential tuition due to increased graduate enrollment. However, our goal is to keep our graduate education as cost effective as possible. We also have a need for additional faculty and administrativ e support. W ith the focus on research in both the undergraduate major and the graduate program in our newly re - imagined curriculum, we see the need for at least one additional full -time faculty member in the SoA who has expertise in research methods for ar chitectural design and experience as a professional architect. This faculty line currently is not within the SoA or CA+P budgets. Additionally, i n order to effectively build the research opportunities and capacity within our program, new funding is needed for an administrative position to oversee research and the related academic content in both undergraduate and graduate programs (for example, funding that allows a course release for a faculty member). University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 70 Since 2016 -17, the College has moved toward a m ission -centered analysis of expenditures in an effort to invest in those areas of need which have the greatest impact on our mission and academic excellence and also to become more efficient in other areas. We have started this approach with the reallocation of dollars to increase support for students through additional graduate assistantships and by launching the Scholarship Incentive Program (SIP) for faculty. (See S ection 2.4 for further description of the SIP program.) We also have added program fees where ne eded to help offset the costs of our unique high impact educational experiences - for example, students in the new Design Foundations curriculum now pay a fee to help to cover the additional costs of administering the curriculum and its associated support structure (peer mentors and studen t success advisors) and cohort -building events. As we continue to develop our new curriculum, the integrated teaching model (with two or more instructors collaboratively teaching) may not be quite as cost -efficient as the conventional teaching model (one instructor per course). However, we feel strongly that this is the best model for contemporary architectural education and well worth any additional cost. We are working to make sure the cost to the students is kept at a minimum, especially for the immersive experiences in our graduate program (DesignBui ldBLUFF , Design Build Salt Lake, Urban Design, etc.). We continue to look for outside funding to grow these unique experiences and to build in research opportunities for students and faculty. At the College level, we currently are pursuing three interdisciplinary initiatives that we plan to tie into the next University capital campaign. The first focuses on community engagement, a true strength of the SoA and the College . The CA+P would like to create a Center for Community Engagem ent that employs public -interest design strategies to serve the people of the State of Utah. Current work supported by such a center includes our DesignBuildBLUFF and Design Build Salt Lake program s, the Westside Studio in City & Metropolitan Planning, and our various service -learning and community engagement projects in the School and the College. Second, with the strength of our Health Sciences campus, the College seeks to create a focus on healthy e nvironments , in particular lifespan design (e.g. , children, the aging, differently -abled). Third, to capitalize on the Univers ity's strength in ecology, we wish to further develop our Ecological Planning and Design Center. Our vision for these centers is to be models of integrated scholarship, involving teaching, research, and service. The physical space needed to accommodate such centers would be folded into a University capital campaign. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 71 6.2 Physical facilities Most s tudio instruction for architecture majors and graduate students occurs in s hared, open studios on the third floor of the building. Seminar classes take p lace in R ooms 228 and 229, which are critically outdated, largely inflexible rooms, and lectures for up to 95 people occur in R oom 127 , which is similarly outdated . Other seminars and l arger lecture courses take place in classrooms across campus, typically in the old Business Classroom Building, the Marriott Library , or the new Gardner Commons classroom b uilding. Most faculty members have a private office for teaching pre paration, engagement in scholarship, and advising, but some office sharing also now occurs out of necessity, due to space shortages emerging with the growth in the College over the past decade. The School of Architecture has a conference room enabling priv ate advising for faculty and students and an adjacent office suit e for the Chair and SoA Administrative Officer /Graduate Advisor. Faculty are provided with computing equipment in their offices, and all computer networks may be accessed remotely, allowing r eady connection to work at home or on the road. The architecture building is a part of the Art and Architecture Center (AAC) built in 1970. It is a 47,000 gross square foot building that is highly regarded for its design by faculty, students, and the members of the architecture community, receiving the AIA Utah Twenty -five Year Award in 200 6. A 2011 study demonstrated the build ing's shortcomings in terms of maintenance and upkeep, its insufficient support for contemporary teaching methodologies, its inaccessibility, and its inefficiency. Overall program growth has been substantial, from 280 students studying only architecture in 2002 (prior to the change from the Graduate School of Architecture to the College of Architecture + Planning) to double the number in architecture and planning in 10 years . This increase in student numbers led the former Dean to launch a capital campaign to finance a $25 million renovation along with a new 25,000 sf net-zero addition to the north end of the architecture building. Unfortunately, that capital campaign was not successful, and s ince then, the overall student population of the College has grown to around 575 students in design foundations, architecture, multi -disciplinary design, and urban ecology and planning ), requiring approximately 350 studio desks. The new smaller desks that we are using in the third floor studios allow for a 33% increase in desk capacity , but we also have had to increase capacity by renovating four racquetball courts in the old Einar Nielsen Fieldhouse to accommodate four additional studio spaces. Because of the need of architecture major and graduate students to be close to the fabrication shop and plotters, we use the Fieldhouse studios primarily for pre -major courses. This is not ideal, University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 72 as a goal of the Design Foundations program is to have the st udents feel as included in our C ollege as possible - and sending them to a build ing 10 minutes from the architecture building is not conducive to this. To be most effective, we require additional studio and lab spaces in or closer to the architecture building . This would be most easily accomplished with an addition, as was p roposed by the previous Dean. A building addition also would allow for increased capacity for research a ctivities and faculty offices - as the programs in our C ollege and our student numbers continue to grow (we have almost 50% more students now than at th e time of the last program review), we have a desperate need for additional office and lab space for faculty and student research and teaching . While we have made great strides in the last few year s in updating teaching spaces, Room 228 (one of only fo ur classrooms in our building) is very outdated. The tiered bolted -in-place seating allows only for one style of teaching and not for the collaborative methods we are trying to integrate into our courses. This space is greatly in need of a major renovation . The most conspicuous need in the architecture building, however, is even more basic than serving the space demands of teaching and research - the architecture side of the Art and Architecture Complex is completely inaccessible to anyone with mobility i ssues. The only elevator in the complex is located in the Fine Arts wing, so students, staff, faculty, and visitors who are not able to navigate the stairs must walk or wheel outside or across a bridge at the second or third level to access the elevator. O nce a t their desired level, they must again move outside or across one of the bridges to ret urn to the Architecture wing. For a school that is committed to teaching about equity and accessibility, the architecture building serves as a blatantly poor exampl e. We have studied and determined the best location for an elevator (given the seven different levels in the building) and fundraising is ongoing. This important building upgrade needs to take place to help facilitate our teaching and our recruitment of a diverse student body. 6.3 Libraries The School of Architecture has a very productive and ever -expanding collaboration with the Marriott Library, which support s student research and projects, as well as purchase s books, equipment, and software geared toward architecture. The SoA's relationship to the Marriott Library is particularly important as the Library provides teaching and learning spaces (computer classrooms and the new Digital Matters Lab, for example ) tha t are not available in the architecture building. The Marriott Library also continues to be an University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 73 excellent partner in providing access to specialized software and equipment such as 3 -D printers. Currently the Marriott Library, with some funding from the Scho ol of Architecture, is acquiring a large -format 3 -D printer that will be very useful to our students. Additionally, t he Fine Arts and Architecture Librarian, Luke Leither, has an appointment as an Adjunct Assistant Professo r in the School of Architecture a nd works together with architecture faculty on research grants and projects. The Katherine W. Dumke Fine Arts and Architecture Library, located on the second floor of the Marriott Library, offers unique spaces and resources for students and faculty study ing the arts and architecture. Media editing stations, current periodicals, a dedicated 3,500 -volume collection of rare books, and a regularly staffed reference desk make the library a destination for architecture an d planning students. The Dumke L ibrary employs three full -time librarians with subject expertise, one paraprofessional, and three part-time workers, all of whom contribute to programming and collection development for users. In recent years, the J. Willard Marriott Library has shifted to a pat ron-driven acquisition approach. This strategy places an emphasis on purchasing materials that will be used by faculty and students and de -emphasizes the \"purchase everything\" model. Extensive outreach by subject librarians and a strong acquisitions team e nsure that patrons have access to the materials that they need, when they need them. The nature of this new model requires acquisition monies to be more centralized than in the past. Selectors for each department can use pooled funds to purchase items base d upon patron requests or their own professional expertise. In addition, the Marriott Library has a wide -reaching approval plan for architecture materials with Yankee Book Peddler, which automatically selects essential titles in the discipline for purchase. Separate funds and endowments also are set aside for database access, journal subscriptions, and rare books. This dynamic model of collection development makes the best use of budgets and advancing technologies. Most items that are requested can be orde red, delivered, and placed on the shelves in a matter of days. Electronic versions of materials are preferentially selected and can be made available almost immediately upon request. An active Interlibrary Loan department ensures that patrons have access to rare materials that the library cannot purchase and sends out many items from their own extensive collections. The results of this strategy have been positive. The architecture collection continues to grow; and the influence of faculty, students, and s taff ensure the use of the collection as well as its diversity. The library currently owns approximately 30,000 architecture books in print, 270 online (these are books cataloged in the NA, 720, and selected HT call University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 74 ranges), and approximately 800 architect ure-specific journal subscriptions. Additionally, collaboration between faculty members and librarians has created greater understanding and led to the purchase of new innovative resources and collections. One recent and noteworthy acquisition is a profe ssionally collected and curated materials collection housed within the Fine Arts and Architecture Library. Early in 2015 the library signed an agreement with the firm Material ConneXion to purchase a 1,500 - piece collection of innovative materials together with ongoing access to their materia ls database of more than 7,000 materials and design processes . The Library expected the SoA students and faculty to be heavy users of the collection, and the purchase would not have been possible without SoA and CA+P faculty recommendation and advocacy. In short, the Marriott Library continues to be committed to and capable of providing the highest quality services and resources to the School of Architecture. 6.4 Centers, institutes or bureaus associated with the pro gram The School of Architecture does not administer any centers, institutes or bureaus, as all centers in the CA+P report directly to the Dean. SoA faculty participate (somewhat peripherally at this time) in the Center for Ecological Planning and Design, within which ITAC (Integrated Technology in Architecture Coll aborative) is located. 6.5 Technology Our building is connected to the University's network backbone with a 2 GB fiber link. The network is distributed internally to faculty and staff offices, computer labs, and student desktops in studio spaces with 1 GB bandwidth connections from managed Dell switches. There are about 550 wired network nodes throughout the College. In addition to the wired network, there are six wireless access points installed which support up to 50 connections each at a maximum 802.11n -spec 300Mb bandwidth. The C ollege has three primary domain servers, each running the Windows Server 2010 operating system supporting file, print, web, network, software licensing, and backup functions. All students, faculty, and staff have computer accounts, which allow secured acce ss to personal home folders on the servers containing public web publishing areas and other file shares. Most network shares are also accessible offsite via FTP. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 75 An instructional computer lab containing 24 workstations is open for all students to use 24 hours a day, seven days a week, except when a class is in session. For hardware, each workstation contains an Intel i7 processor, 8GB RAM, 120GB solid state drive, and a workstation -class nVidia Quadro OpenGL graphic card connected to a 1080p LED backlit 22\u00ee monitor. All workstations contain the same software image installed with Windows 7 Ultimate 64 -bit operating system and the latest v ersions of Microsoft Office, Autodesk Architecture, Revit, 3DS Max Design, Creative Cloud, ESRI ArcGIS, Rhino3D, and SketchUp Pro . A portion of the lab computers are updated yearly, and the replaced computers get moved to a small render farm closet which supports network rendering features of Autodesk 3DS Max Design. There are about two dozen computers in the farm which students use to offload processing and compose videos of virtual design projects and high -quality renderings. The C ollege has two HP Enterprise m601dtn LaserJet printers, one Epson large -format color inkjet printer, and three 44\" HP DesignJet z6100 p lotters available for student use and another two HP Enterprise m601dtn LaserJet printers, one Canon large -format color inkjet, and a Sharp copier primarily for faculty use. The printers and plotters are available to students and faculty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Students are required to provide their own paper rolls for use in the plotters, and the College provides ink, toner, and letter -sized paper. There are three scanning workstations (including one large - format professional flatbed) available for student use 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, there are two video capture devices supporting both analog and digital video streams connected to DVD/VCR players/recorders for video editing. Faculty have access to another workstation with a n Epson V200 letter -sized flatbed scanner in addition to a Xerox DocuMate 152 document scanner. Three classrooms , a conference room, and the faculty lounge (which is used for meetings and reviews of student work) have fixed projection equipment . Students and faculty have access to the rooms unless classes are in session. In addition, there are four projectors and four Windows laptops available for checkout to use for course presentations. The College Fabrication Lab (\"the shop\") contains a laser cutter a nd engraving system connected to a workstation computer with RhinoCAM software and a large format CNC mill in an adjacent \"Fab Lab\" space . The shop also is well -equipped with machinery and hand tools for use with wood and metal and has a loading dock and o utdoor fabrication area. The shop has extended hours during each weekday and is managed by a shop technician at all times. It is open on weekends as needed for certain student projects. The CA+P has a full -time Network Manager and full -time Computer Techni cian available for computer and network support, as well as a Fabrication Lab Manager and student supervisors for the shop. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 76 In regard to whether this infrastructure adequately supports the program, with the recent addition of the large format CNC mill, the equipment and tools available for student use is on par with most other schools of architecture. Where the infrastructure i s lacking is in the availability of specific software packages used in architec tural communications courses, studios , and technology courses (including software for life cycle assessment, lighting simulation, acoustical analysis, building performance analy sis, and the like) . Much of this software is prohibitively expensive for the SoA to purchase. We work closely with the Marriott Library to provide access to uncommon software whenever possible , but in that case students often must use a computer at the lib rary to access the programs. With our larger student cohorts, it can be difficult to find an adequate room equipped with computers in the library. Our students also would benefit greatly from access to software tutorials (such as those available through Bl ack Spectacles or other companies that focus on architecture software) that would allow them to learn the software at their own pace. Additionally, as we extend our teaching and learning spaces farther from the architecture building (such as our studios in the Fieldhouse), it becomes more and more difficult for our students to readily access our equipment and for our support staff to assist students and faculty in locations outside of the building. 6.6 Staff support The School of Architecture has one dedicated staff person, the Administrative Officer, who also serves as the Graduate Advisor. Other suppo rt staff are shared within the College, including the Senior Accountant, Public Relations Specialist, Director of Development, Computer Technician, Network Manager, and three Academic Advisors. Of these nine positions, six are held by wom en (five white and one Pacific I slander) and three are held by men (all white). The great majority of the assistance from staff is in the realm of academic support, particularly by the Academic Advisors, Network Manager, and Computer Technician. The Director of Development supports both the academic and research efforts of the CA+P, by assisting with finding and executing certain kinds of grants (primarily those from family foundations or similar granting agencies), as well as working toward increasing the number of scholarships available to our students and developing donor support for capital improvements and the like. The Public Relations Specialist is a key playe r in bringing attention to our S chool and College by advertising the results of important academic and research projects, faculty and student honors and awards, and general infor mation about our programs. The C ollege accountant plays a vital role in all res earch grants, as well as assisting with the financial management of the academic programs. University of Utah Graduate Council Program Review 2018-19 School of Architecture 77 The School of Architecture Administrative Officer (AO) is imperative to the smooth operation of the SoA. The AO's responsibilities include handling day -to-day operations and procedures, as well as meetings and events; assisting with the development of department budgets; maintaining and monitoring accounts, budgets, and expenditures of the department and its associated programs; processing and implementing human resource management tasks of SoA faculty , staff, and students; handling payroll for the department and its associated programs; facilitating and processing performance reviews of departmental faculty, staff, and students by t he department chair and progra m directors; collecting, organizing, and analyzing data for specialized reports (e.g., accreditation); advising and assisting graduate students with academic and financial aid concerns and interfacing with the Graduate School, as needed; monitoring graduat e student acad emic progression and graduation and maintaining student and alumni records; providing updates to the websites for the department and its associated programs as directed by the department chair and the program directors; coordinating purchasin g activities, personnel actions, document control, and account coding for financial transactions and overseeing the maintenance of departmental records; providing administrative support to the department chair and the program directors ; and providing suppl ement al support to fellow administrative staff in the C ollege, particularly for special events. The SoA has two additional staff (one male, one female, both foreign -born of Asian descent) who work specifically with the DesignBuildBLUFF program and are b ased in Bluff, UT. Their roles include facility and equipment upkeep and maintenance, day -to-day operations and support of the DBB program, and DBB program planning and coordination. The C ollege staff are quite active in the life of the College and provid e significant support within their specific areas and also with general C ollege events. Issues that may be of concern to the staff in terms of morale, workload, or participation in department/ program administration stem primarily from d ifficulty with the number and timing of university trainings for new staff in order to get access to necessary information to complete required work in a timely manner . This was particularly evident for the new SoA Administrative Officer, as she continues to have trouble accessing information even after completing the myriad of necessary trainings since her hire in June 2018. It appears as though the U niversity's on -boarding for new staff in important administrative an d advising positions could be more streamlined and clear.

The External Review Committee included: Timothy de Noble, AIA (Committee Chair) Professor and Dean College of Architecture, Planning and Design Kansas State University Nichole Wiedemann , M.Arch Associate Professor School of Architecture University of Texas Douglas Noble, FAIA , PhD Associate Professor and Chair School of Architecture University of Southern California The Internal Review Committee of the University of Utah included: Timothy A. Ameel , PhD Profe ssor Department of Mechanical Engineering Eric Michael Handman , MFA Assistant Professor Department of Modern Dance Pamela K. Hardin , PhD Assistant Professor College of Nursing The following summary is based on an analysis of the self-study materials submitted by the School of Architecture , the reports of the external and internal review committee s, the report of the University Diversity Committee , and response s from Prof. Prescott Muir , Director of the School of Architecture , and Prof. Brenda Case Scheer, Dean of the College of Architecture and Planning. DEPARTMENT PROFILE Overview The Department of Architecture has been in existence since 1949 and has been accredited continuously by the National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB) since its initial accreditation in 1954 . The Department was initially housed in the College of Fine Arts and became the Graduate School of Architecture in 1974. In 2002, the undergraduate program in planning was brought into the same unit as architecture and the unit was renamed College of Architecture + Planning. In 2008, the School of Architecture and the Department of City and Metropolitan Planning became separate departments within the College . At a recent faculty retreat in Spring 2011, a mission statement was developed for the College that serves to advance the discipline and professions of architecture, design, urban design and planning through excellence in education, scholarly and creative endeavors, and professional and community service. Their mission is to: (1) educate dedicated and competent architects, planners, designers, urban designers, and preservation professionals, and provide general design education to university students; (2) advance knowledge through inn ovative research, scholarship, and creative work; (3) promote community outreach, internship and service as an important component of our educational responsibility; and (4) foster public sensitivity to architecture, design, planning and related urban and environmental issues. A strategic plan exists for the College, but according to the Director, it was developed prior to the separate establishment of the Department of City and Metropolitan Planning and the School of Architecture in 2008 . The School of Arc hitecture currently does not have a program -specific strategic plan in place, which the external reviewers noted was evident in some disparate views of long - and short -term objectives expressed by faculty. The Director's response indicates that the School is now in the process of developing a program -specific strategic plan. According to the self -study, the architecture program at the University of Utah is one of the smallest state -supported programs in the country, which the faculty acknowledge is both an asset and a liability. Because of its small size, the more intimate lea rning environment lends itself to highly interactive instruction and personal mentoring of students that fosters collegial relationships , similar to that provided at smaller private schools . In fact, t he reviewers commented on the very strong sense of comm unity among both faculty and students. On the negative side, the small program does not appear in the annual rating of architecture schools conducted by Design Intelligence, making it more challenging for the program to maintain national prominence and potentially hinder ing efforts to recruit non resident students . Much of the School's national reputation and attraction to prospective students has been attributed to the School's longstanding association with the DesignBuildBluff (DBB) program, which provides students with University of Utah Graduate Council Review - School of Architecture 2011-12 - Page 2 opportunities to gain understanding and efficacy of design through hands -on learning on the Navajo Reservation. Although changes in the DBB program's administration and remote location have made student participation and faculty oversight difficult, other design -build initiatives are being planned . The School currently offers a B achelor of Science degree in Architectural Studies (BSAS) , which students apply to just before their junior year. There also is an Honors Program available for top tier undergraduate architecture students. At the graduate level, the Department offers several versions of the Master of Architecture degree (M.Arch) , which is an accredited professional degree . The 4 +2 program offers a 4 -year pre -professional degree combined with the 2-year professional degree, the 3+ program is designed for those with a baccalaureate degree in a field other than architecture, and the accelerated program, which starts in the Summer se mester directly following the senior year and continues for four successive semesters. The School also offers a post -professional M aster of Science degree in Architect ural Studies (MSAS) , which is a nonprofessional program with historic preservation or technology as a major area of study . At present, there are no students enrolled in the MSAS program, which has struggled to build a critical mass of student s, and as a result has been dormant for the last several years. The Director's response indicated that there has been renewed interest in the MSAS program, with several new student applicants. A joint program for the Master of Architecture and Master of Business Administration is available (MBA/M.Arch) , and a similar joint program with the Master of Arch itecture and Master of Real Estate Development is in the early implementation stage. An interdisciplinary graduate - level certificate in Historic Preservation is also offered, which is a 15 -credit hour program that focuses on historic preservation issues in the Western U.S. Another graduate -level certificate in Real Estate has been developed, which is an 18 -credit hour program combining courses in real estate, architecture and planning. Faculty In the last five years, there ha s been significant turnover among st the faculty in the School of Architecture. Three new tenure -track faculty and two new clinical faculty were hired, four tenured faculty retired, and one faculty left for another position. For 2010 -2011, t he School include d 9 FTE regular faculty members with different levels of appointments (e.g., two faculty share l eadership appointments at the University level ; one faculty is on sabbatical) . The School anticipates a new regular tenure -track hire for 2012, and is currently in the process of negotia tions with a candidate. There also are 22 adjunct faculty members who play a critical role in the teaching mission of the School. The regular faculty in the School represent 9.0 FTE positions and include 4 assistant professors, 3 associate professors, and 6 full professors (1 as Chair) . According to the self -study, the average age of the faculty is 42 years . Last summer, the Uni versity converted the salary of the previous dean (who retired) to a dedicated line within the School, which became an open position in the area of history and theory. As noted, n egotiations are currently underway with an applicant for this position to begin Fall 2012 . The School reported that 41% of faculty are women University of Utah Graduate Council Review - School of Architecture 2011-12 - Page 3 and 17% are ethnic or racial minorities. The University Diversity Committee indicated that these percentages are comparable to the University -wide percentages of 28% and 12% , respectively. According to the response from the Director, recent efforts to prioritize diversification of faculty were successful in that the new faculty hire for the history and theory position is a woman of color. Both the internal and external reviewers were impres sed with the distinguished scholarship and research of the faculty . Tenured/tenure -track faculty have active and directed scholarly agendas, resulting in a wide variety of publications, presentations, and creative architecture activities, such as exemplary architectural designs. Faculty are nationally recognized in the areas of Sustainability, Visualizati on and Animation, Digital Technology, Information Architecture, Structural Concepts, Dynamic Simulation, Preservation, Architectural History and Community Service. The recent new faculty hires are seen as an infusion in energetic talent tha t can address cu rricular needs. Despite limited funding within the architecture discipline, faculty have been successful in securing sponsored research funds from local foundations and corporations and the University, as well as small grants from national foundations. T he School continues to prioritize research and offers faculty seed grant funds and some faculty travel support to attend national and international conferences. Both the internal and external reviews commented on the need to examine faculty salaries and increase resource allocations for travel and research in order to facilitate retention of faculty. Undergraduate Students The undergraduate population was made up of 316 undergraduate majors in the 20 10- 2011 academic year , with 36 BS degrees awarded in 2011. This has been a fairly steady rate over the last 5 years . The s tudents are very enthusiastic about the School and expressed respect and enthusiasm for the facu lty. Individual exit interviews, conducted by the Director , provide opportunities for e ach student to provide feedback about the program, and this feedback becomes incorporated into program or curricular changes when warranted. The internal reviewers commented on the struggles that students face in financing valuable overseas studio opportuni ties and the lack of an organized structure for finding internship opportunities. Students also expressed some concerns regarding the lack of opportunity to take elective courses , which is partly due to the guidelines for curriculum set by the NAAB . Revie wers indicated that the tenured and tenure -track faculty may be encumbered by covering the required courses at the expense of providing specialized elective offerings, which are more frequently covered by adjunct faculty. Data regarding u ndergraduate s tudent major s indicate that 25% are women, which is an improvement since the last review . This indicates that recruitment efforts have been successful in attracting more women into the architecture field of study. The racial and ethnic diversity of the student population is not tracked, but estimated by the School to be at 13%, which again , is an University of Utah Graduate Council Review - School of Architecture 2011-12 - Page 4 improvement since the last review. No report of retention or graduation rates of underrepresented groups is provided. The self -study indicates that undergraduate students in the second year of the BSA S degree program have priority in receiving sc holarship awards. Students may also apply for University scholarship and financial aid programs. Graduate Students The graduate student population was comprised of 104 students in the 20 10-2011 academic year, with 43 master's degrees awarded. The rate of graduate student enrollment has remained relatively stable over the past 3 years, with a slight increase since 5 years ago . Of the graduate student population, 30% of students during 20 10-2011 were female , and in the self -study the School estimated that 14% belong to underrepresented minority group s, although racial and ethnic diversity is not specifically tracked . This represents an improvement since the last review. The self -study indicates that approximately 55% of graduate students requesting aid receive some amount of financial assistance . Funding for fellowships and assistantships is provided primarily by the professional community or through construction -related industries, and is awarded to graduate students on a competitive basis. Total aid support amounts to approximately $129,000 , which is augm ented by the Graduate School's Tuition Benefit P rogram . Additional funding through the Roger Bailey Traveling Fellowship Fund has supplied some supp ort for international travel through an endowment that currently guarantees about $2,000 per year. The internal review recommended that increased scholarship support for students is warranted with the suggestion of granting somewhat fewer, but higher , graduate stipends in an effort to attract more diverse and international students. Curriculum and Programs of Study The School of Architecture offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees . At the undergraduate level, the School offers a bachelor 's degre e in Architectural Studies (BSAS), a multidisciplinary design minor, and an honors program. The School has developed a proposal for an undergraduate design major, which is currently undergoing University review. A plan to develop a graduate certificate pro gram in design is also being considered. Students are admitted into the BSAS program at the end of their sophomore year. Faculty are currently considering an earlier entry into the program, which would add an extra semester of studio work to students' application portfolio s, and therefore benefit them when applying to graduate school. The program is planning to increase undergraduate enrollment, thereby increasing the pool of candidates applying to graduate programs in the School of Architecture. Increa sing undergraduate enrollment will also increase the number of applicants applying to out -of-state gradua te programs, which can help enhance the national visibility of the program. At the graduate level, the School of Architecture offers a Master of Architecture degree (M.Arch) with three variations (4+2, 3+, Accelerated) and a n MS in Architecture Studies (MSAS), which is currently inactive with no enrolled students. The School also offers a graduat e University of Utah Graduate Council Review - School of Architecture 2011-12 - Page 5 certificate in H istoric Preservation and another g raduate certificate in Real Estate. A joint degree program with a M aster of Architecture and Master of Business Administration (MBA/M.Arch) is offered , and a similar joint program with a Master of Architecture and Master of Real Estate Development is in the early implementation stage. Since the last review, the School has developed the accelerated M.Arch program, which consists of four consecutive semesters of study beginning Summer semester (SU, FA, SP, SU). The cost of the accelerated program is 40% less than the traditional M.Arch program for nonresident and international students due to instate tuition being applied during the summer semesters. The acce lerated program was developed in an effort to attract more out -of-state and international applicants. The School has admitted two fully subscribed cohorts to the accelerated program to date. The fi rst cohort included more nonresident and international students, but this was not true of the second cohort. Greater publicity about the accelerated program may be necessary in order to attract more out -of-state and international applicants. A Doct or of Architecture degree is currently not offered , and although it has been considered, the addition of a doctoral degree is not in the immediate or long-range plan of the School at this time . Such an addition would require additional faculty as currently ther e are few faculty who hold the doctorate degree. Facilities and Resources The School is housed in the Architecture Building , which is approximately 33,000 net square feet. The building contains the Roger Bailey Exhibition Hall, two smaller exhibition spaces, two classr ooms, large studio spaces for students, faculty offices, a computer lab, an auditorium, and a recently renovated wood and metal shop. An additional classroom is being remodeled into faculty of fices. The Exhibition Hall is spacious and use d for exhibitions, juries, and receptions. The School sometimes uses other campus facilities for public lectures, professional gatherings, and events when necessary . Students are assigned their own studio space but lack adequate space for formal juries/critiques in the studios. The building was originally built to house 60 graduate -level students and now houses more than 255 students across the College, in addition to faculty. The limited space reflects the 200% increase in graduate degrees awarded in the past nine years. The College recently conducted a \"Net Zero Retrofit Facilities Plan\" that calls for a net zero retrofit, cod e-compliant upgrade of the existing bui lding and a 19,827 -square -foot addition . The College is currently in the process of securing University and state approval for this building project. This initiative was highly praised by the external review team, who saw it as a means of substantially inc reasing external recognition of and interest in the School. The College house s collections in the Katherine W. Dumke Fine Arts and Architecture Library within the Marriott Library. Despite budget cuts, journal subscriptions have been maintained and are available electronically. The College Visual Resource Library in Marriott Library maintains a collection of over 40, 000 slides for faculty and students to use for teaching University of Utah Graduate Council Review - School of Architecture 2011-12 - Page 6 and research purposes. Faculty, students, and staff have access to the School's computer network, scanners, plotters, and other digital equipment. The College has a use agreement with the College of Engineering for equipment sharing. Over the last seven years, t he School has supported a design -build immersi ve program on the Navajo Indian Reservation. The DesignBuildBluff (DBB) program is a center with a focus on design research in net zero housing f or low income families in rural locations. This program has received AIA design awards for its off -the-grid residential buildings and has b ecome a positive brand for the S chool, providing students with a unique transformative experience. As of 2010, DBB be came a non -profit corporation that is managed by its own staff and governing board. These changes in the DB B administration, including the difficulties associated with its remote location, have made student participation and administrative oversight very difficult. The School is currently exploring two new design -build opportunities for students, one locally with th e Girl Scouts of Utah to create new buildings for their summer camp , and another focused on building schools in Chiapas, Mexico. The School also maintains an exchange program with the Universidad Nacional del Litoral in Santa Fe, Argentina, and is exploring further such exchange connections in Turin, Italy, and with the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City, Mexico. Such conne ctions provide students with valuable opportunities to experience architecture applications in diverse cultures. Additionally, the School houses the Integrated Technology in Architecture Center (ITAC) , which is co-directed by two faculty. ITAC has several ongoing funding research projects in the area of building technology. Program Effectiveness and Outcomes Assessment Program assessment consists primarily of individual feedback from graduating students and alumni. The Director conducts exit interviews with each graduating student at the undergraduate and master's level , which have elicited constructive feedback that has been used for program improvement. Examples include: 1) a requirement that a specific piece of design software (Revit) be required in the comprehensive studio, 2) the addressing of concerns regarding adjunct in structor commitment resulting in the replacement of some adjuncts, and 3) the revamping of the c urriculum to include finance as one of the topic s in research methods. Quantifiable data of program outcomes consists only of degree completion and attrition da ta. At the m aster 's level the final studio is intended as a forum for in -depth research, which is demonstrated in a comprehensive final studio project. Student design awards are given to ensure a competitive process. An assessment of these final projects provides another means of measuring program outcomes. The School's performance is also measured using external assessments. The professional school accreditation is conducted every 6 years and an accreditation review is due in 2013 . The School has been continuously accredited by NAAB in good standing since 1954. Overall student performance on the Architectural Registration Exam (ARE) has been high, with the percentage pass rate in the top tier of programs nationally. University of Utah Graduate Council Review - School of Architecture 2011-12 - Page 7 The School's Advisory Board, consisting pri marily of alumni, meets four times a year to provide input on governance issues, strategic plans and goals. These emp loyers feel that there are no major problems in the program; however, most felt that the writing skills of the graduates could be improved and that presentation skills could be emphasized more. The Board members are highly supportive of the travel programs that allow students to see architecture in other settings and would like to see this program grow. Although employment of graduates is not systematically tracked, e mployment opportunities for graduates were reported to be good prior to the recent econom ic downturn. Prior to 2009, 100% of graduates could find work in the field of architecture. Currently, the employment rate in the profession of architecture is estimated at 30 -40%, requiring some graduates to work in allied fields such as construction and product manufacturing. Actions Taken Since the Last Program Review The last program review occurred in 2004. Below is a summary of the Graduate Council's recommendations and actions taken by the School of Architecture : 1. National visibility . The College hosted the A merican Colleges and Schools of Architecture (A CSA ) National Conference in 2006 , which served to enhance its national visibility. In the las t several years, the College's W ebsite has been upgraded, inc luding a student blog, and the W ebsite is updated regularly by a media staff person. In addition, the School was recognized by AIA's publication, Architect Magazine , for its leadership in urban and community -related curriculum and outreach. 2. Student diversity . There has been an increased focus on recruiting a broader and larger pool of student applicants. The hiring of a recruitment specialist has resulted in targeted efforts to recruit and retain underserved populations, women, and non -resident students. The School also reports an increase in foreign student applicants. Corresponding increases in both gender and ethnic diversity of faculty were also reported due to faculty hires since the last program review . 3. Restructuring of curriculum . Faculty were hired with expertise in sustainable desi gn and green building design in order to ad dress the concern of increasing curriculum coverage in these areas. Additionally, a revamped professional practice course sequence will be initiated in the fall of 2012 that emphasizes research methods and leaders hip, which addresses concerns regarding expanding curriculum in critical inquiry. 4. Establishment of s eparate Archit ecture and Planning d epartments . The establishment of separate Architecture and P lanning departments within the College has gone smoothly. The programs are closely integrated, with many cross -listed classes and collaborative teaching. The two programs also share service on many committees and responsibilities at the University and College levels. The collaborative atmosphere has been enhanced with the hiring of the new City and Metropolitan Planning Department Chair. University of Utah Graduate Council Review - School of Architecture 2011-12 - Page 8 5. RPT policy . RPT policies and procedures have been revised to incorporate the suggestions offered in the last Graduate Council Review to clarify the expectations for promotion and tenure. Since the last program review, four new faculty have successfully achieved tenure status . COMMENDATIONS Both the external and internal re views offered considerable praise for accomplishments that the School has made since the last review. The following represent s a synthesis of the commendations discussed in the internal and external reports in regard to the School of Architecture : 1. The faculty should be highly commended for the posi tive learning environment they have created . There is evidence of a strong commitment to the academic and personal welfare of students , and the students think very highly of their faculty. Among other areas of interest, the focus on design and sustainability , and extremely relevant and politically engaged areas of inquiry , are notable. Additionally, faculty have established longstanding relati onships with the local architectural community, who serve as expert reviewers of student work. 2. The program has received some well -deserved national recognition through the DesignBuild Bluff program . While not required of all students, much of the School's national reputation and att raction to prospective students comes from this loosely associated program. Opportunities for design/build activities are important in this era as students gain significant understanding and efficacy of design through hands -on learning. The potential for recognition and good will generated through service learning is also important in building the regional and national reputation of the program. The program is currently pursuing additional design -build opportunities for students both locally and internationally . 3. Faculty shoul d be applauded for their creative revisi ons to the curricula in an attempt to increase visibility for the School. Expanding the undergraduate program and developing an accelerated graduate program are innova tive steps meant to both import and export an increase in out-of-state students. 4. The School should also be co ngratulated on its ongoing efforts to increase diversity by way of mentoring programs, connecting with historically underrepresented student organizations, and creating a summer program for high school students , as well as the hiring of a recruitment specialist . University of Utah Graduate Council Review - School of Architecture 2011-12 - Page 9 5. Tenured faculty are supportive of and invested in the success of the junior faculty. Lines of communication are open between senior and junior faculty and there exists a sense of high morale and stability , which encourages a stimulating exchange of ideas. Additionally, revisions to RPT policies and procedures include updates that better reflect aspects of the field of architecture as a profession as well as an academic discipline with unique and multiple areas of inquiry. RPT expectations seem appropriate an d clear and have resulted in junior faculty giving high marks to the College on its RPT process. 6. The College is to be congratulated on hiring effective development staff who have provided important strategic support to the School and College, including invaluable assistance in grant writing and grant management, as well as coordination of philanthropic support. 7. The available space in the Architecture Building is being used strategically and completely. Faculty have advo cated for students and provided the resources they need to be competitive in applying for graduate school and employment. Faculty and students wisely utilize other campus facilities when necessary , including the College of Engineering, the Marriott Library, and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts. RECOMMENDATIONS The following recommendations represent a synthesis of the recommendations discussed in the internal and external reports in regard to the School of Architecture : 1. An updated, program -specific five-year strategic plan that in corporates the newly devised mission statement and also includes program goals and objectives should be completed as planned . This strategic plan should be based on input from all faculty and be revisited annually to assess progress towards the established objective s and goals. 2. At present, p rogram assessment is primarily based on anecdotal evidence . Although i t is appar ent that student input is taken seriously , as it has been used constructively to improve the program , efforts should be undertaken to acquire object ive, quantifiable data that may be use d to assess program outcomes. An objective assessment instrument that requires numeric input could be designed and implemented in conjunction with the exit interviews currently conducted with graduates by the Director. Similar instruments could be used annually with both graduating students and alumni to allow for anonymous input and generate a database for assessing quantifiable program changes over time. 3. The accelerated program at the graduate level, although success ful locally, appears to lack broader visibility. To increase awareness and grow the enrollment among nonresident and international students , the accelerated master 's program should be advertised more widely. Although it may be difficult at present, increas ing the number of students in the undergraduate program would positively impact the program. University of Utah Graduate Council Review - School of Architecture 2011-12 - Page 10 4. All efforts to continue to build faculty and student diversity should be maintained and enhanced. Ongoing recruitment efforts to increase student quality and diversit y should be continued and expanded . The Office of the Associate Vice President for Equity and Diversity is committed to th is goal and may provide useful ideas and strategies in this regard. The use of annual progress reports to the Graduate School should be considered as a way to encourage the Department to work effectively towards this goal . 5. Development efforts should be co ntinued . Development priorities should include a capital campaign to refit and expand the Architecture B uilding, purchase of additional digital fabrication equipment to keep the program current, more funds for salary enhancement, professional development a nd sabbatical opportunities for faculty, and promotional efforts to increase the nati onal visibility of the School . Additionally, to assist the student recruitment effort, resources to grow the number of scholarships and teaching assistantship opportuniti es for students should also b e pursued. 6. The School should c onsider establishing a more formalized mechanism to enhance consistent communication of events, deadlines, and opportunities across the entire school community. Scheduling periodic informat ional gatherings of the entire School , along with regular communiqu\u00e9s , would also serve to provide a more formal mechanism of communication, particularly between faculty and students. 7. The School may wish to consider alternative strategies to its present policy for the granting of graduate student aid. The granting of somewhat fewer, but higher, graduate stipends would be one way to attract more, and potentially stronger, students from outside the state. This may also serve to attract more diverse and inte rnational students.

Michael L. Hardman, Interim Senior Vice P resident for Academic Affairs; Brenda C. Scheer, Dean of the College of Architecture + Planning; Prescott M. Muir, Director of the School of Architecture; Charles A. Wight, Dean of the Graduate School; and Donna M. White, Associate Dean of the Graduate Sch ool, were present. The discussion centered on but was not limited to the recommendations contained in the revised Graduate Council review completed on April 30, 2012. At the wrap -up meeting, the working group agreed to endorse the following actions: Recommendation 1: An updated, program -specific five -year strategic plan that incorporates the newly devised mission statement and also includes program goals and objectives should be completed as planned. This strategic plan should be based on input from all faculty and be revisited annually to assess progress towards the established objectives and goals. The Director of the School of Architecture held a faculty retreat in 2011 and developed the current mission statement as well as program goals and objectives. For the last year, the College has been engaged in a strategic planning process and the Dean has provided an outline for the School to use. This combined effort to finalize strategic plans both at the College and School levels must be com pleted for the national accreditation review scheduled for 2013. Once completed, the strategic plan will be revisited annually for the National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB) and updates will also be articulated in annual progress reports prepare d for the Graduate School. Recommendation 2: At present, program assessment is primarily based on anecdotal evidence. Although it is apparent that student input is taken seriously, as it has been used constructively to improve the program, efforts shou ld be undertaken to acquire objective, quantifiable data that may be used to assess program outcomes. An objective assessment instrument that requires numeric input could be designed and implemented in conjunction with the exit interviews currently conduc ted with graduates by the Director. Similar instruments could be used annually with both graduating students and alumni to allow for anonymous input and generate a database for assessing quantifiable program changes over time. Memorandum of Understandi ng School of Architecture Graduate Council Review 2011 -12 Page 2 The Director and the Dean described numerous quantifiable measures of program assessment that are based on student performance indicators. Some examples include: licensing exam results (students from this program have been in the top 10 -12 ranked programs nationally for many years), annual public juried reviews of the final master's projects of all graduating students, and over 30 specific measures of student performance requ ired by the national accreditation body which again are based on student performance outcomes. These are all quantifiable indicators that present evidence that go beyond the anecdotal. In addition, since the Graduate Council external and i nternal reports were submitted, the Director has worked with the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence (CTLE) to redesign the exit interview he uses to provide more objective, quantifiable answers. This new survey was implemented for the first time in the spring of 2012. The faculty will be encouraged to continue to use this feedback and data in ongoing ways as they continue to make decisions on improving the program. The Director noted that he has not yet addressed the part of the recommendation o n annual interviews with alumni but he is supportive of this suggestion. Recommendation 3: The accelerated program at the graduate level, although successful locally, appears to lack broader visibility. To increase awareness and grow the enrollment amon g nonresident and international students, the accelerated master's program should be advertised more widely. Although it may be difficult at present, increasing the number of students in the undergraduate program would positively impact the program. The Director agrees that it is a goal to recruit high quality students who are nonresident and/or international at the graduate level. He will work with the new College recruitment/public relations staff in this regard and will engage the faculty, through the strategic planning process, to consider the most effective way to revitalize the accelerated program while upping the quality of the students. Undergraduate admission is already selective, and it would be difficult to increase the number of students in the undergraduate program due to facility and other resource challenges. The U. of U. has the only School of Architecture in the state, so it is important to maintain a reasonable percentage of admissions for in -state students. At the same time, the Graduate Dean urged the Director and Dean to recruit top undergraduate students from outside of Utah in order to boost the graduate programs in general. Recommendation 4 : All efforts to continue to build faculty and student diversity should be maintained a nd enhanced. Ongoing recruitment efforts to increase student quality and diversity should be continued and expanded. The Office of the Associate Vice President for Equity and Diversity is committed to this goal and may provide useful ideas and strategies in this regard. The use of annual progress reports to the Graduate School should be considered as a way to encourage the Department to work effectively towards this goal. Memorandum of Understanding School of Architecture Graduate Council Review 20 11-12 Page 3 Ongoing, strategic efforts to increase diversity among faculty and students have yielded results for the School, and the Dean and Director remain committed to maintaining and enhancing those efforts. Currently, the School of Architecture faculty is 50% more diverse than other programs at the University, and diversity among the student body has been increased since the last review. The Director and Dean are proactive in their diversity efforts and discussed strategies to recruit more His panic students from the community and also to create a cohort model based on the Medical School's, which is planned to start in the fall of 2013. It should be noted that there are several commendations (one in the report of the University Diversity Committ ee) for the efforts and results the School has achieved to increase diversity. Since this review took place, a new faculty member, a woman of color, has been hired. Recommendation 5 : Development efforts should be continued. Development priorities shou ld include a capital campaign to refit and expand the Architecture Building, purchase of additional digital fabrication equipment to keep the program current, more funds for salary enhancement, professional development and sabbatical opportunities for facu lty, and promotional efforts to increase the national visibility of the School. Additionally, to assist the student recruitment effort, resources to grow the number of scholarships and teaching assistantship opportunities for students should also be pursu ed. The Dean has a well -conceived development plan in place. She works on annual goals that address all of the priorities listed in this recommendation, and there are major gift donors that are being pursued. All parties agreed that this recommendation is a challenge on many levels but the Sr. Vice President will continue to work with the Dean to make progress. The refit and expansion of the Architecture building and the acquisition of digital fabrication equipment are crucial initiatives to move forwar d if the School is to stay current and viable nationally and internationally. The longstanding relationship of the School to the DesignBuildBluff (DBB) program is in a state of flux, and though it offers many opportunities in terms of national visibility, recruitment, and student research, there remain many challenges in terms of resources, management, and leadership. The Sr. Vice President is wor king with the Dean to strategize about the future of this program to make the undertaking successful and sustainable. Recommendation 6 : The School should consider establishing a more formalized mechanism to enhance consistent communication of events, d eadlines and opportunities across the entire School community. Scheduling periodic informational gatherings of the entire School, along with regular communiqu\u00e9s, would also serve to provide a more formal mechanism of communication, particularly between fa culty and students. Memorandum of Understanding School of Architecture Graduate Council Review 2011 -12 Page 4 The College has created a staff position for a media/events coordinator who is also updating the Website. All events are highlighted on the We bsite and are included on a School -wide calendar created on CANVAS. In addition, annual social events and numerous Brown Bag events have been offered in the past, and currently a student blog is being created to connect students to students as well as stu dents to faculty. The School is making comprehensive, concerted efforts to address this recommendation. Recommendation 7 : The School may wish to consider alternative strategies to its present policy for the granting of graduate student aid. The granti ng of somewhat fewer, but higher, graduate stipends would be one way to attract more, and potentially stronger, students from outside the state. This may also serve to attract more diverse and international students. The School will continue to distrib ute existing funds and supplement assistantships with scholarship endowment funds for graduate students as is warranted. The Graduate Dean encouraged the Director to involve the faculty in decision -making regarding making awards to exceptional students at full funding levels. The faculty could decide that they want to prioritize attracting out -of-state and international students with these higher level funding offers. It should be noted that the high visibility international exchange opportunities with t he Universidad Nacional del Litoral of Santa Fe, Argentina, has had a positive impact on the School's recruitment efforts. This memorandum of understanding is be followed by annual letters of progress from the director of the School of Architecture to th e dean of the Graduate School. Letters will be submitted each year until all of the actions described in the preceding paragraphs have been completed. Michael L. Hardman ______________________________ Brenda C. Scheer Charles A. Wight Prescott M. Muir Dean, The Graduate School Charles A. Wight July 12, 2012 Donna M. White 2014 Follow -up Report Memorandum of Understanding School of Architecture Graduate Council Review 2011 -12 This memorandum of understanding is a summary of decisions reached at a wrap -up meeting on June 25, 2012, and concludes the Graduate Council Review of the School of Ar chitecture. Michael L. Hardman, Interim Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs; Brenda C. Scheer, Dean of the College of Architecture + Planning; Prescott M. Muir, Director of the School of Architecture; Charles A. Wight, Dean of the Graduate School; and Donna M. White, Associate Dean of the Graduate School, were present. The discussion centered on but was not limited to the recommendations contained in the revised Graduate Council review completed on April 30, 2012. At the wrap -up meeting, the wo rking group agreed to endorse the following actions: Recommendation 1: An updated, program -specific five -year strategic plan that incorporates the newly devised mission statement and also includes program goals and objectives should be completed as pl anned. This strategic plan should be based on input from all faculty and be revisited annually to assess progress towards the established objectives and goals. The Director of the School of Architecture held a faculty retreat in 2011 and developed the current mission statement as well as program goals and objectives. For the last year, the College has been engaged in a strategic planning process and the Dean has provided an outline for the School to use. This combined effort to finalize strategic plans both at the College and School levels must be completed for the national accreditation review scheduled for 2013. Once completed, the strategic plan will be revisited annually for the National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB) and updates will also be articulated in annual progress reports prepared for the Graduate School. 2014: The faculty holds two retreats annually , one in the fall before start of school and one in the spring after the completion of the semester. The spring retreat is dedic ated to assessment and making recommendations for curriculum adjustments. The fall retreat is dedicated to ma king committee assignments and setting committee work agendas that are directly tied to implementation of the 2012 strategic plan. This year's agen da will be moving beyond the initial 3 year action plan to the 5 year level. The SoA participated in a NAAB accreditation review in 2013 with final results delivered in the summer of 2013. This year has been dedicated to implementing changes recommended by the visiting team report that includes curriculum adjustments and a review of college level procedures and policies. An abbreviated Annual NAAB report was filed in the fall of 2013. The dean's office created an associate chair position dedicated to prep aring for the next NAAB visit in 2016. Associate Professor Mimi Locher accepted this appointment. Recommendation 2: At present, program assessment is primarily based on anecdotal evidence. Although it is apparent that student input is taken seriously , as it has been used constructively to improve the program, efforts should be undertaken to acquire objective, quantifiable data that may be used to assess program outcomes. An objective assessment instrument that requires numeric input could be designed and implemented in conjunction with the exit interviews currently conducted with graduates by the Director. Similar instruments could be used annually with both graduating students and alumni to allow for anonymous input and generate a database for asses sing quantifiable program changes over time. The Director and the Dean described numerous quantifiable measures of program assessment that are based on student performance indicators. Some examples include: licensing exam results (students from this program have been in the top 10 -12 ranked programs nationally for many years), annual public juried reviews of the final master's projects of all graduating studen ts, and over 30 specific measures of student performance required by the national accreditation body which again are based on student performance outcomes. These are all quantifiable indicators that present evidence that go beyo nd the anecdotal. In addition, since the Graduate Council external and internal reports were submitted, the Director has worked with the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence (CTLE) to redesign the exit interview he uses to provide more objective, q uantifiable answers. This new survey was implemented for the first time in the spring of 2012. The faculty will be encouraged to continue to use this feedback and data in ongoing ways as they continue to make decisions on improving the program. The Director noted that he has not yet addressed the part of the recommendation on annual interviews with alumni but he is supportive of this suggestion. 2014: The SoA continues to conduct quantitative and qualitative assessment of student performance. Each studi o class participates in year -end juries of students work with juries comprised of faculty and seasoned practitioners. In 2013 t he program participated in a NAAB visiting team review c ulminating in a final report with the next accred itation visit scheduled for 2016. The Chair continues to conduct exit interviews of all graduating students, an anonymous survey of graduates and a survey of alumni conducted in the summer of 2012. The alumni survey will be conducted again in 2015. In the past the college recei ves input and feedback fro m an Advisory Council that will be reconstituted under the new dean's direction. Recommendation 3: The accelerated program at the graduate level, although successful locally, appears to lack broader visibility. To increase awa reness and grow the enrollment among nonresident and international students, the accelerated master's program should be advertised more widely. Although it may be difficult at present, increasing the number of students in the undergraduate program would p ositively impact the program. The Director agrees that it is a goal to recruit high quality students who are nonresident and/or international at the graduate level. He will work with the new College recruitment/public relati ons staff in this regard and will engage the faculty, through the strategic planning process, to consider the most effective way to revitalize the accelerated program while upping the quality of the students. Undergraduate admission is already selective, and it would be difficult to increase the number of students in the undergraduate program due to facility and other resource challenges . The U. of U. has the only School of Architecture in the state, so it is important to maintain a reasonable percentage of admissions for in -state s tudents. At the same time, the Graduate Dean urged the Director and Dean to recruit top undergraduate students from outside of Utah in order to boost the graduate programs in general. 2014: It looks like the enrollment for incoming graduate students this year is up considerably from last year with 16 external students of the 36 accepted. However the interest in the accelerated program contin ues to lag behind expectations and was canceled this ye ar due to too lack of interest. The college has redoubled re cruitment efforts with foray s into the local highschools followed by hosted events on campus. The SoA will be conducting a summer workshop targeting highschool students especially f rom underrepresented communities . We have a new director of the Design Build Bluff graduate school program who is m aking recruitment inroads with the Navajo Nation where the program is located. T he Chair is joining an AIA sponsored diplomatic exchange with Dali University, China this summer with an eye on further student recruitm ent. Recommendation 4 : All efforts to continue to build faculty and student diversity should be maintained and enhanced. Ongoing recruitment efforts to increase student quality and diversity should be continued and expanded. The Office of the Associa te Vice President for Equity and Diversity is committed to this goal and may provide useful ideas and strategies in this regard. The use of annual progress reports to the Graduate School should be considered as a way to encourage the Department to work ef fectively towards this goal. Ongoing, strategic efforts to increase diversity among faculty and students have yielded results for the School , and the Dean and Director remain committed to maintaining and enhancing those efforts. Currently, the School of Architecture faculty is 50% more diverse than other programs at the University, and diversity among the student body has been increased since the last revi ew. The Director and Dean are proactive in their diversity efforts and discussed strategies to recruit more Hispanic students from the community and also to create a cohort model based on the Medical School's, which is planned to start in the fall of 2013 . It should be noted that there are several commendations (one in the report of the University Diversity Committee) for the efforts and results the School has achieved to increase diversity. Since this review took place, a new faculty member, a woman of color, has been hired. 2014: See response to recommendation #3 above. The SoA hired a person of color to be the Director of the Design Build Bluff program for the 2013/2014 academic year. The college hired Saolo Bethan as the new recruitment office for th e college. The SoA was able to finally launch next fall our new Architecture LEAP cohort program that will be targeting underrepresented student audiences. The Chair completed articulation agreements with the University of Wyoming and renewe d ones with BYU Provo and BYU Idaho that included site visits to recruit students . Further efforts to identify potential students include identifying community colleges with pre - architecture programs and making contact with them. Recommendation 5 : Development efforts should be continued. Development priorities should include a capital campaign to refit and expand the Architecture Building, purchase of additional digital fabrication equipment to keep the program current, more funds for salary enhancement, professional development and sabbatical opportunities for faculty, and promotional efforts to increase the national visibility of the School. Additionally, to assist the student recruitment effort, resources to grow the number of scholarships and teaching assistantsh ip opportunities for students should also be pursued. The Dean has a well -conce ived development plan in place. S he works on annual goals that address all of the priorities listed in this recommendation, and there are major gift donors that are being pu rsued. All parties agreed that this recommendation is a challenge on many levels but the Sr. Vice President will continue to work with the Dean to make progress. The refit and expansion of the Architecture building and the acquisition of digital fabricatio n equipment are crucial initiatives to move forward if the School is to stay current and viable nationally and internationally. 2014: During the dean search th is year the capital campaign continues with emphasis on securing a lead gift . Scholarship donat ions have r emained steady without significant increase . The ITAC research center has at tracted some new grant money being reenergized by the return of it's co - director who was on sabbatical last year. The longstanding relationship of the School to the Des ignBuildBluff (DBB) program is in a state of flux , and though it offers many opportunities in terms of national visibility, recruitment, and student research, there remain many challenges in terms of resources, management, and leadership. The Sr. Vice Pre sident is working with the Dean to strategize about the future of this program to make the undertaking successful and sustainable. 2014: The SoA hired a new director for the DBB program this year under a term of three years . The program has received seve ral new grants not previously achieved. The program replaced through contributions an existing vehicle. The new director has just finished his initial year and complet ed the second house over this period . The MOU between the SoA and the University of Color ado Denver was renewed. In this next year the director is expected to rebuild the advisory committee and expand development opportunities. Recommendation 6 : The School should consider establishing a more formalized mechanism to enhance consistent commu nication of events, deadlines and opportunities across the entire School community. Scheduling periodic informational gatherings of the entire School, along with regular communiqu\u00e9s, would also serve to provide a more formal mechanism of communication, pa rticularly between faculty and students. The College has created a staff position for a media/events coordi nator who is also updating the Website. All events are highlighted on the Website and are included on a S chool -wide calendar created on CANVAS. In addition, annual social events and numerous Brown Bag events have been offered in the past , and currently a student blog is being created to connect students to students as well as students to faculty. The School is making comprehensive, concerted effort s to address this recommendation. 2014: The college just completed a year long review of college and departmental policies bringing them inline with uni versity policies . The college through their event coordinator regulary posts events both in fliers aro und the building, on the SoA website and on a new flat screen mounted in a central building location. The DBB maintains an active blog whereby residents in the program maintain communication with the main cam pus. While the college continues a vigorous lect ure schedule, student attendance is below expectations. In an effort to improve student attendance the lectures were moved to the noon hour and many classes require attendance. Recommendation 7 : The School may wish to consider alternative strategies to its present policy for the granting of graduate student aid. The granting of somewhat fewer, but higher, graduate stipends would be one way to attract more, and po tentially stronger, students from outside the state. This may also serve to attract more diverse and international students. The School will continue to distribute existing funds and supplement assistantships with scholarship endowment funds for gradua te students as is warranted. The Graduate Dean encouraged the Director to involve the faculty in decision -making regarding making awards to exceptional students at full funding levels. The faculty could decide that they want to p rioritize attracting out -of-state and international students with these higher level funding offers. It should be noted that the high visibility international exchange opportunities with the Universidad Nacional del Litoral of Santa Fe, Argentina , has had a positive impact on the School's recruitment efforts. 2014: Although the scholarship funding hasn't increased, the money is used effectively to recruit highly sought after student prospects. During the summer of 2013 , the SoA launched a summer lab program in Chicago where the s tudent work with city officials in studio settings that are located within several architecture firms . The SoA is looking to expand it's exchange programs to include Japan and Italy because of the popularity of these destinations among our students. This memorandum of understanding is be followed by annual letters of progress from the director of the School of Architecture to the dean of the Graduate School. Letters will be submitted each year until all of the actions described in the preceding paragraphs have been completed. Michael L. Hardman ______________________________ Brenda C. Scheer Charles A.

The fall retreat is dedicated to ma king committee assignments and setting committee work agendas that are directly tied to implementation of the 2012 strategic plan. This year's agen da will be moving beyond the initial 3 year action plan to the 5 year level. The SoA participated in a NAAB accreditation review in 2013 with final results delivered in the summer of 2013. This year has been dedicated to implementing changes recommended by the visiting team report that includes curriculum adjustments and a review of college level procedures and policies. An abbreviated Annual NAAB report was filed in the fall of 2013. The dean's office created an associate chair position dedicated to prep aring for the next NAAB visit in 2016. Associate Professor Mimi Locher accepted this appointment. 2016: Recommendation 1 has been fully addressed in a sustainable manner. Prescott Muir completed his term as Chair in December 2014, and Associate Professo r Mimi Locher moved into the Chair position. Associate Professor Lisa Henry Benham was appointed Associate Chair and worked with the Chair to lead the School of Architecture (SoA) faculty in a visioning process to respond to the College's new vision put fo rth by Dean Keith Diaz Moore, who joined the College in July 2014. As part of the preparation for the spring 2016 NAAB accreditation visit, the SoA rearticulated its mission and core beliefs in relation to the many changes which have occurred in the Colleg e and in the profession since the previous mission, vision, and strategic plans were developed. At the heart of the current School mission is the recognition that architectural practice is inherently value -laden and therefore recognition of the values unde rlying our processes and products is essential in our research and teaching. The full vision and mission are available here: http://soa.cap.utah.edu/vision -and-mission/ . The SoA strategic plan i s integrally connected to the CA+P's long range plan, which came out of a college -wide retreat in January 2015. The faculty of the College identified numerous important long-term initiatives that the College Leadership Team (consisting of the Dean, Associa te Deans, and Chairs) then refined into 25 SMART goals ( http://www.cap.utah.edu/college -goals/ ). During summer 2015, the SoA Chair and Associate Chair revised the School's long range plan and short term goals based on the CA+P SMART goals and end -of-semester all -faculty reviews of course content and student work products. The plan and goals were developed into a long range planning document and presented to the SoA faculty for review and revision at the School's fall 2015 retreat . The major goals of the strategic plan include: 1. Re-imagination of the undergraduate and graduate curricula. 2. Increase the number of students receiving assistantships, internships, and other compensated professional experience s by 50 percent by AY2018. 3. Raise the average ACT of admitted undergraduate students to 24.5 or higher by 2017 and 25.0 by 2019. 4. Increase external support (gifts, grants, contracts) to over $2 million annually by AY2018 and tie into the SoA's plan for the recruitment and retention of students, especially women and other minorities. 5. Implement a meaningful set of interdisciplinary learning experiences for our students by fall 2016. 6. By Spring 2016, have a plan for building upon and advancing the core missio n of Design - Build BLUFF (DBB) to provide design -build service learning involving students and communities in need. 7. By AY 2017, create a program for learning spaces within our existing building that fosters the ability to collaboratively engage in new mode s of learning, thinking and making. In response, w e have begun a year -long curriculum re -imagination process facilitated by CTLE. We are making excellent headway on the creation of innovative curricula based on our mission and values. We also created a co mprehensive recruitment plan and increase d available Graduate Assistantship funds by $30,000. W e continue to work with the local professional community to increase support through new scholarships and fellowships. To provide interdisciplinary learning expe riences, we have implemented a College -wide charrette activity in the first week of the fall semester and t he SoA has worked with the City and Metropolitan Planning program to develop a collaborative nested studio experience. DesignBuildBLUFF Director Jos\u00e9 Galarza has been working closely with the Chair and Dean to further develop the program's connections at the University and in the Navajo Nation and to explore an expanded role for its headquarters in Bluff, UT. A working group of faculty from multiple di sciplines across the University has been meeting regularly and working on a planning document for shared activities in the Bluff area. In spring 2017, some SoA studio courses will meet in newly renovated spaces in the Fieldhouse, freeing up space in the bu ilding for collaborative work areas and multi -media classrooms. Recommendation 2: At present, program assessment is primarily based on anecdotal evidence. Although it is apparent that student input is taken seriously, as it has been used constructivel y to improve the program, efforts should be undertaken to acquire objective, quantifiable data that may be used to assess program outcomes. An objective assessment instrument that requires numeric input could be designed and implemented in conjunction with the exit interviews currently conducted with graduates by the Director. Similar instruments could be used annually with both graduating students and alumni to allow for anonymous input and generate a database for assessing quantifiable program changes o ver time. The Director and the Dean described numerous quantifiable measures of program assessment that are based on student performance indicators. Some examples include: licensing exam results (students from this program have been in the top 10 -12 ranked programs nationally for many years), annual public juried reviews of the final master's projects of all graduating students, and over 30 specific measures of student performance required by the national accreditation body which aga in are based on student performance outcomes. These are all quantifiable indicators that present evidence that go beyond the anecdotal. In addition, since the Graduate Council external and internal reports were submitted, the Director has worked w ith the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence (CTLE) to redesign the exit interview he uses to provide more objective, quantifiable answers. This new survey was implemented for the first time in the spring of 2012. The faculty will be encouraged to continue to use this feedback and data in ongoing ways as they continue to make decisions on improving the program. The Director noted that he has not yet addressed the part of the recommendation on annual interviews with alumni but he is supportive of t his suggestion. 2014: The SoA continues to conduct quantitative and qualitative assessment of student performance. Each studio class participates in year -end juries of students work with juries comprised of faculty and seasoned practitioners. In 2013 t he program participated in a NAAB visiting team review c ulminating in a final report with the next accred itation visit scheduled for 2016. The Chair continues to conduct exit interviews of all graduating students, an anonymous survey of graduates and a survey of alumni conducted in the summer of 2012. The alumni survey will be conducted again in 2015. In the past the college receives input and feedback fro m an Advisory Council that will be reconstituted under the new dean's direction. 2016: Recommendation 2 is almost addressed, with specific tasks identified for completion . The SoA evaluates the efficacy and outcomes of the M.Arch degree program utilizing several different forms of assessment. Since spring 2014, all -faculty reviews of SoA course content and student work take place at the end of each semester and are an important component of our assessment process. Faculty are able to see firsthand where strengths and weaknesses lie within the academic program and immediately identify and discuss potential sol utions. An anonymous online survey of graduate students at the end of the academic year asks about learning and achievement opportunities related to accreditation -mandated Student Performance Criteria and the SoA mission and core beliefs. All students gra duating from the M.Arch program are interviewed individually by the Chair just prior to graduation, with the goal of understanding their perspectives of their academic and professional preparation. Individual faculty members also conduct exit interviews wi th students and bring relevant information to faculty discussions. Periodic alumni surveys continue to provide additional information regarding preparation for professional work and life within the architectural community. The results of these varied annu al assessment activities are collated and discussed in the SoA retreat at the start of each fall semester. The faculty then identify issues that become the agenda for the SoA committees, where concrete suggestions for programmatic and curricular changes leading to improved outcomes are formulated and brought back to the faculty for final approval. Since we are currently engaged in major curricular change, new assessment instruments will need to be developed to provide accurate quantifiable data. Recommend ation 3: The accelerated program at the graduate level, although successful locally, appears to lack broader visibility. To increase awareness and grow the enrollment among nonresident and international students, the accelerated master's program should b e advertised more widely. Although it may be difficult at present, increasing the number of students in the undergraduate program would positively impact the program. The Director agrees that it is a goal to recruit high quality students who are nonres ident and/or international at the graduate level. He will work with the new College recruitment/public relati ons staff in this regard and will engage the faculty, through the strategic planning process, to consider the most effective way to revitalize the accelerated program while upping the quality of the students. Undergraduate admission is already selective, and it would be difficult to increase the number of students in the undergraduate program due to facility and other resource challenges . The U. of U. has the only School of Architecture in the state, so it is important to maintain a reasonable percentage of admissions for in -state students. At the same time, the Graduate Dean urged the Director and Dean to recruit top undergraduate students from ou tside of Utah in order to boost the graduate programs in general. 2014: It looks like the enrollment for incoming graduate students this year is up considerably from last year with 16 external students of the 36 accepted. However the interest in the accel erated program contin ues to lag behind expectations and was canceled this ye ar due to too lack of interest. The college has redoubled recruitment efforts with foray s into the local high schools followed by hosted events on campus. The SoA will be conducti ng a summer workshop targeting highschool students especially f rom underrepresented communities . We have a new director of the Design Build Bluff graduate school program who is m aking recruitment inroads with the Navajo Nation where the program is located. The Chair is joining an AIA sponsored diplomatic exchange with Dali University, China this summer with an eye on further student recruitment. 2016: Recommendation 3 is not addressed . Due to the declining interest in the accelerated program, as well as c ontinued low graduate enrollment (which is likely to change in fall 2019 due our current large undergraduate population), the program has been cancelled for the present time. (The final group of students completed the program in summer 2016.) Since the SoA currently is working on a major curriculum re -imagination, we will re -visit the idea of an accelerated program in spring 2017. Recommendation 4 : All efforts to continue to build faculty and student diversity should be maintained and enhanced. Ongoing recruitment efforts to increase student quality and diversity should be continued and expanded. The Office of the Associate Vice President for Equity and Diversity is committed to this goal and may provide useful ideas and strategies in this regard. The use of annual progress reports to the Graduate School should be considered as a way to encourage the Department to work effectively towards this goal. Ongoing, strategic efforts to increase diversity among faculty and students have yielded results for the School , and the Dean and Director remain committed to maintaining and enhancing those efforts. Currently, the School of Architecture faculty is 50% more diverse than other programs at the University, and diversity among the student body has been inc reased since the last review. The Director and Dean are proactive in their diversity efforts and discussed strategies to recruit more Hispanic students from the community and also to create a cohort model based on the Medical School's, which is planned to start in the fall of 2013. It should be noted that there are several commendations (one in the report of the University Diversity Committee) for the efforts and results the School has achieved to increase diversi ty. Since this review took place, a new faculty member, a woman of color, has been hired. 2014: See response to recommendation #3 above. The SoA hired a person of color to be the Director of the Design Build Bluff program for the 2013/2014 academic year. The college hired Saolo Bethan as the new r ecruitment office for the college. The SoA was able to finally launch next fall our new Architecture LEAP cohort program that will be targeting underrepresented student audiences. The Chair completed articulation agreements with the University of Wyoming and renewe d ones with BYU Provo and BYU Idaho that included site visits to recruit students . Further efforts to identify potential students include identifying community colleges with pre - architecture programs and making contact with them. 2016: Recommend ation 4 is fully addressed in a sustainable manner. The SoA continues to hire and promote diverse faculty (most recently Associate Professor Rima Ajlouni, PhD, a female professor of Jordanian background, and Wei \"Windy\" Zhao, PhD, a female post -doc of Chin ese origin.) Our new recruitment plan (see recommendation #1) addresses the recruitment of students from diverse backgrounds, and we have begun to see an increase in Latina/o students in the undergraduate program. In AY 2014 -15, we started a new academic p rogram, Architecture LEAP, a year -long course designed to create a cohort experience for freshmen students , in particular those from underrepresented groups . The success we are seeing in the undergraduate program will work into the graduate program startin g in AY 2017 -18. Recommendation 5 : Development efforts should be continued. Development priorities should include a capital campaign to refit and expand the Architecture Building, purchase of additional digital fabrication equipment to keep the progra m current, more funds for salary enhancement, professional development and sabbatical opportunities for faculty, and promotional efforts to increase the national visibility of the School. Additionally, to assist the student recruitment effort, resources t o grow the number of scholarships and teaching assistantship opportunities for students should also be pursued. The Dean has a well -conce ived development plan in place. S he works on annual goals that address all of the priorities listed in this recomme ndation, and there are major gift donors that are being pursued. All parties agreed that this recommendation is a challenge on many levels but the Sr. Vice President will continue to work with the Dean to make progress. The refit and expansion of the Archi tecture building and the acquisition of digital fabrication equipment are crucial initiatives to move forward if the School is to stay current and viable nationally and internationally. 2014: During the dean search th is year the capital campaign continue s with emphasis on securing a lead gift . Scholarship donations have r emained steady without significant increase . The ITAC research center has at tracted some new grant money being reenergized by the return of it s co- director who was on sabbatical last year . The longstanding relationship of the School to the DesignBuildBluff (DBB) program is in a state of flux , and though it offers many opportunities in terms of national visibility, recruitment, and student research, there remain many challenges in terms of resources, management, and leadership. The Sr. Vice President is working with the Dean to strategize about the future of this program to make the undertaking successful and sustainable. 2014: The SoA hired a new director for the DBB program this year u nder a term of three years . The program has received several new grants not previously achieved. The program replaced through contributions an existing vehicle. The new director has just finished his initial year and complet ed the second house over this pe riod. The MOU between the SoA and the University of Colorado Denver was renewed. In this next year the director is expected to rebuild the advisory committee and expand development opportunities. 2016: Recommendation 5 is almost addressed, with specific tasks identified for completion. With the arrival of Dean Keith Diaz Moore in August 2014, the strategies and goals for the building renovation and expansion have changed. The capital campaign was put on hold while a new structural relationship with the Un iversity's Office of Institutional Advancement (OIA) was developed. With the support of Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Ruth Watkins, the CA+P instituted a new structure for college advancement. As of summer 2015, the College has been work ing directly with a development officer in the University's OIA rather than having a development officer in house. The CA+P is one of a number of colleges piloting to this model, which is meant to allow better access to and support from the OIA. However, after o ne year of the pilot, the Dean has determined that having an in -house development person will be better for the College, and a search has been initiated. While this restructuring has delayed any major progress in the area of development and advancement, th e College and School leadership see the new structure as an investment in future success in these areas. Despite this change in priorities and restructuring of development model, the CA+P has moved forward with several important facility improvements. The roof of the building underwent repairs during the 2014 -15 academic year (a new roof membrane was installed, skylights were resealed, and leaks repaired), and the building was retrofitted with fire sprinklers during the summer of 2015. As part of the sprink ler retrofit, old lights were replaced with new energy efficient fixtures, and lights in several public spaces were connected to motion control devices to conserve energy in unoccupied spaces. The energy -efficient lighting modifications are part of the initial efforts of the CA+P's newly formed \"Green Team,\" established by Dean Diaz Moore in spring 2015 and charged with encouraging behavioral change to reduce energy usage throughout the building. The CA+P is the second college at the University to take up t he challenge for energy reduction from University Office of Facilities Management, with students, faculty, administration, and staff from all departments continuing these efforts throughout the 2015 -16 and the 2016 -17 academic years . A new college -level F acilities and Technology Committee established in 2014 and chaired by Associate Dean Keith Bartholomew, monitors and deals with issues of space, physical facility maintenance, and technology needs. The committee has identified concerns from faculty and students regarding shared undergraduate pre -major studio space, the need for formal display areas for student work, and a student lounge area. The first issue has been resolved, and the final two issues are being addressed by the Dean during the 2015 -16 acade mic year. Recommendation 6 : The School should consider establishing a more formalized mechanism to enhance consistent communication of events, deadlines and opportunities across the entire School community. Scheduling periodic informational gatherings of the entire School, along with regular communiqu\u00e9s, would also serve to provide a more formal mechanism of communication, particularly between faculty and students. The College has created a staff position for a media/events coordi nator who is also upda ting the Website. All events are highlighted on the Website and are included on a S chool -wide calendar created on CANVAS. In addition, annual social events and numerous Brown Bag events have been offered in the past , and currently a student blog is being created to connect students to students as well as students to faculty. The School is making comprehensive, concerted efforts to address this recommendation. 2014: The C ollege just completed a year long review of college and departmental policies bring ing them in line with uni versity policies . The college through their event coordinator regulary posts events both in fliers around the building, on the SoA website and on a new flat screen mounted in a central building location. The DBB maintains an active blog whereby residents in the program maintain communication with the main cam pus. While the college continues a vigorous lecture schedule, student attendance is below expectations. In an effort to improve student attendance the lectures were moved to the noon hour and many classes require attendance. 2016: Recommendation 6 is almost addressed, with specific tasks identified for completion. With the hire of a College -level Public Relations Specialist in fall 2015, communication has greatly improved. The SoA and CA+P websites were completely revamped, and our social media presence has been greatly increased. The SoA is working on a shared calendar of events, which will be hosted on the new website, and updated regularly by our new Graduate Assistant for PR (who is mentored by the CA+P PR Specialist and the SoA Chair). The SoA has implemented several initiatives aimed at better communicating important information to faculty and students. For faculty, the Chair set up a shared folder on Box which contains a l ist of important dates (prepared prior to the start of the academic year), all committee minutes, and other key information. For students, the SoA now hosts a spring Open House, where graduate students (including prospective students) are introduced to cou rse options for the upcoming academic year. From fall 2015, the SoA committees were reorganized, and the Academic Culture and Outreach committee was tasked with organizing and advertising SoA events, such as the lecture series, end -of-semester reviews and celebrations, and the Open House. While the committee is still working out the formalization of the process for organizing events, this year's lecture series and the lectures series poster were completed in a much more timely manner than in past years.

APPENDICES 12 Appendix A- Notice of URPTSC Final Approval 12 K.1 MDD Program Description The Multi -Disciplinary Design program, with both an undergraduate major and a minor, uses product design as a vehicle to inv estigate design research, human -centered design principles, interface development, articulation of product forms, materials and digital manufacturing princ iples. The program has two tracks -digital products and physical product s. This interdisciplinary program train s students to compete in an increasin gly complex work environment through a thorough understanding of ethical conduct and social responsibility based on these specific concepts: inquiry and project -based learning critical thinking skills experimentation with multiple ways of problem solving visual literacy innovation and invent ion team building and collaboration identifying authentic real -world tasks and challenges design research human centered design principles The multi-disciplinary Bachelor of Science in Design degree program encompasses a curriculum with four substantive a reas applicable to all design education: studio, technical, history/ theory and practice. In addition to the classes and faculty from the Design program, the curriculum has been developed with existing University of Utah faculty and courses from Architecture, Fine Arts, Communication, Business, Bio -Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Psychology. This program has at its core the shared fundamental understanding of the language, process and application of design and design thi nking. This proposes to use design as a verb for activities rooted in four cornerstones: Engagement, Community, Collaboration and Responsibility. This broad perspective allows for students to see the connections between these design specialties and focus on the process of design as a creative idea and development framework. It expands students' horizons by engaging with other design disciplines in strategic and collaborative ways. This approach can lead to exciting new design engagement that can deeply enga ge the world as it is and as it is becoming.

APPENDICES 12 Appendix A- Notice of URPTSC Final Approval 12 CA+P 2 COLLEGE OF ARCHITECTURE and PLANNING University of Utah Statement of Guidelines and Standards for Retention, Promotion, and Tenure The objective of this Statement is to provide uniform guidelines , standards, and procedures for faculty decisions related to retention, promotion, and tenure (RPT) action. The Statement outlines college-specific procedures for RPT reviews and defines the criteria used in RPT decisions for the departments of the College. I. UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES University policies concerning retention, promotion, and tenure are contained in the University Regulations Library, in policie s 6-300, 6-301, 6-302, 6-303, and 6-311, the current versions of which are available on-line at http://www.regulations.utah.edu/index.html . The College has developed its RPT standards and procedures in accord with these policies . It is the responsibility of each faculty member to be familiar with all RPT policies and procedures contained in this Statement and in the University Policies . II. OVERVIEW OF THE RPT PROCESS Typically, new entry-level tenure-track faculty in the College of Architecture and Planning ar e appointed at the Assistant Professor rank and have a probationary period of seven years. Consideration for promotion to the rank of Associate Professor and tenure customarily occur simultaneously . Each non-tenured Instructor, Assist ant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor are reviewed annually to assess their achievement in teaching, res earch/creative activity, f aculty responsibility, an d service, except during the faculty memb er's first year. On the third and fifth years there are formal retention reviews, with informal reviews in the second, fourth, an d sixth years. A formal review for tenure and promotion to Associate Professor typically occurs in the seventh year. Shortening or extending of the probationary period for individual cases may occur in acco rd with relevant University Policies (6-311, 6-314, 6-315). Associat e Professors with tenure may re quest, after five years at the Associate rank, that a formal review for promotion to Professor be conducted. A. Informal Reviews Informal retention reviews for non-tenured regular faculty members occur every year that does not have a formal review, beginning in the second year. The College purpose for these informal reviews are of a mentoring nature and are intended to provide regular feedback and guidance for junior faculty working toward tenure and promotion. Informal reviews are conducted by the department chair at the end of the fall semester and are based on an internal assessment of the candidate's record as well as a personal interview. The chair will re quest each candidate to submit a file contai ning appropriate mate rials, including but not limited to a curriculum vita and recent p ublications, that pertain to the review. The chair will schedule a face-to-face meeti ng with the candidate to discuss the candidate's progress based on th e file. Upon completion of th e informal review, the chair wi ll provide a written report to the department RPT Advisory Committee chair and to the candidate. Both the committee chair and the candidate shall have the opportunity to respond to the report. The report and the responses, if any, are then filed in the candidate's cumulative file with a copy of each sent to the D ean of the College. Pursuant to University Policy 6-303-III-B-1-c, inadequate progress at the time of an informal re view may lead to a \"triggered\" formal review. B. Formal Reviews Because the College of Architect ure and Planning is a two-depa rtment college, University Po licy 6-003-III-Sec. 2.C requires that the procedures for formal review differ from those in larger colleges. Nevertheless, all decisions for retention, promotion, and tenure involve multiple levels of formal RPT review. Th ere are four independent RPT re commendations in the College generated from the following sources: (1) the Student Advisory Committee (SAC) which consists of undergraduate and graduate students from the relevant department, (2) the department RPT Advisory Committee whose membership is described below, (3) the chair of the department, and (4) the dean. Additionally, in those cases where candidates hold joint appointments in other college departments or programs, the recommendations of these college departments or programs are also solicited and included in the RPT formal review deliberations. At the university level, the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs reviews the file and refe rs it to the University Promot ion and Tenure Advisory Committee (UPTAC) for a recommendation. Final decisions regarding retention, promotion, and tenure are made by the President of the University. CA+P 3 C. Implementation Date and Application to Existing Faculty The RPT standards, criteria, and procedures contained in this Statement come into eff ect as of July 1, 2013. All faculty member RPT candidates appointed on or after this date will be consider ed under these RPT standards an d procedures. Candidates whose appointments began prior to that date who are formally reviewed for retention or the granting of tenure will have the option of choosing the RPT requirements in effect at the time of their in itial appointment as a member of the department's tenure-track faculty or the RPT requirements contained in this Statement. Previously appointed ca ndidates to be reviewed for promotion to the rank of Professor may choose to be reviewed under the requirements in effect at the time of their initial appointment to th e tenure-track faculty only for reviews completed in or before the 2015-16 academic year. In each case, the requirements contained in this Statement will apply unless the candidate's choice of prior requirements is communicated to the department chairperson by signed letter before evalua tion materials are sent to evaluators fo r external evaluations (See V-C-2 below). All decisions with respect to re tention, promotion, and tenure must not discri minate on the basis of race, national origin, sex or gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, status as a physically challenged individual, gender identity or expression, or vete ran status. III. COLLEGE STRUCTURE AND MISSION STATEMENT The College of Architecture and Planning brings together a community of students, faculty, and staff with a broad range of interests and expertise in creative design, building, planning, co mputer technology, issues of social and ecological responsibi lity, and the scholarly study of the history and theory of the built landscape. In this wide range of interests is a common concern f or constructing and maintaining the highest quality in our built and natural environments. To this end, the school offers academically and professionally oriented de gree programs in several related fields, including professionally accredited program s in architecture and city and metropolitan planning. IV. DEPARTMENTAL RPT ADVISO RY COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP During each academic year, each departme nt in the College forms an RPT Adviso ry Committee \"of the whole.\" However, membership on this committee will vary for different actions ta ken during the year depending on the candidate(s) under review. The membership structures described below exclude any faculty member who would have an independent RPT recommendation at a different level of review (e.g., the department chair, and college dean, or university president, if a member of the Colle ge). Per Policy 6-303-III-A-3 & E-5, such officers may attend committee meetings (unless the committee moves to executive session), and upon invitation by the majority may also particip ate in discussion, but cannot vote as members of the committee. The chairperson of the committee shall be el ected annually from tenured members. In this election all regular faculty through the instructor rank shall be entitled to vote. In the event that the elected chair is ineligible for some committee decisions (e.g., an Associate Professor is not eligible to vote in reviews for promotion to Professor), then a second chair will be elected for those reviews. Committee Structure for Retention Reviews. All tenured faculty members, regardless of rank, are eligible to participate in the consideration of and to vote on recommendations in individual cases on matters of retention. Other tenure-track faculty members may participate in the consideration of candidates for retention, but may not vote. Committee Structure for Promotion Reviews. All tenured faculty members of equal or higher rank than that proposed for the candidate for promotion are eligible to participate in the cons ideration of and to vote on recommendations in individual cases on matters of promotion. Other tenured and tenure-track faculty me mbers may participate in the co nsideration of candidates for promotion, but may not vote. Committee Structure for Tenure Reviews. A ll tenured faculty members, regardless of rank, are eligible to participate in the consideration of and to vote on recommendations in individual cases on matters of tenure. Other tenure-track faculty members may participate in the consideration of candidates for tenure, but may not vote. In the event that there are fewer than three faculty eligible to vote on a recommendation for a particular candidate, the chair will, pursuant to University Policy 6-303-III-A- 3-a-iv, recommend to the dean one or mo re faculty members with the appropriate tenure status and rank and with some knowledge of the candidate's field from other units of the University of Utah or from emeritus faculty. In advance of the chair's contacting such facu lty members, the chair shall notify the candidate of the potent ial persons to be asked, and the candidate must be offered the opportunity to comment in writing on the suitability of the potentia l committee members. The final selection rests with the dean. CA+P 4 V. DEPARTMENTAL PROCEDURES AND TIMELINE\u2014Formal Reviews The procedures described here are listed in chronological order. However, the timing of some steps can vary from year to year. Most procedures listed here are dictated by university RPT polic ies, but some are specific to th e College. These procedures are applicable only for formal reviews (s ee Part II-B for informal reviews). A. Spring Semester Prior to Anticipated RPT Reviews The department chair notifies faculty members with obligatory RP T reviews in the upcoming year. The chair sends a letter to each candidate detailing what is required. Copies of University Policies 6-303 and 6-311, and the College statement of RPT standards and procedures are included. B. Summer Semester Prior to Anticipated RPT Reviews The department chair notifies appropriate te nured faculty and tenure-track faculty asking if they wish to request a formal revi ew for promotion or tenure in the upcoming year. Pursuant to Policy 6-303-III-D-9, the RPT Advisory Committee chair requests that each formal review candidate nominate seven established scholars from other universities or research institutions that have expertise related to the candidate's area s of scholarship and creative work who may act as external evaluators of the candidate's work. No external evaluators are used during informal review years. In submitt ing a list of nominees, candidates must desc ribe the qualifications of each potential evaluator (institution, rank or position, and demonstrated areas of expertise). The candidate must also describe any professio nal and/or personal relationship that exists between the candidate and each potential evaluator. The chair also solicits nominatio ns of external evaluators from the faculty and RPT advisory co mmittee. From these nominations the chair selects a minimum of five external evaluators. College policy stipulates that at le ast three of the external evaluators will be chosen from the candidate's recommended list and if not, an explanation of why a decision was made to accept less than the prescribed number will be placed in the candidate's file. The department chair requests that each ca ndidate sign a waiver/non-waiver form concerning the confidentiality of the external evaluators' recommendations. C. Fall Semester of the RPT Review Year 1. The RPT File (Policy 6-303-III-D) Each candidate should begin to compile an RPT file. The department administrative staff provides copies of course evaluation summary sheets for all courses taught by the candidate. The candidate is responsible for the remaining file contents listed he re: a. An updated curriculum vita b. Copies of all publications cited on the candidate's vita sin ce the last formal review. If so me are unavailable, this fact should be noted and the reasons should be explained. Publi cations listed as \"accepted\" or \"in press\" should be verified by copies of letters from publishers, formal contracts, etc. c. Reproductions of creative work cited on the candidate's vita. d. Reproductions of a Teacher Portfolio of Student Work, if applicable. e. A personal statement that explains the materials in th e file, highlights achievements of special note, describes work in progress, and sets forth professional objectives. f. Other professionally relevant materials that the candidate wishes to include (e.g., published reviews or commentary on something published by the candidate, course materials, letters acknowledging public or professional service, etc.). 2. External Evaluators For formal reviews, the department chair c ontacts the selected external evaluators re questing that they se rve as evaluators. Upon acceptance of the responsib ility, the chair sends each evaluator a letter that includes a description of the evaluator's r ole, the College RPT Statement of Guidelines and Standards, the candidate's vita, selected materials provided by the candidate, and a statement about the candidate's choice regarding confidentiality of the evaluator's comments. CA+P 5 3. The Student Advisory Committee (Policy 6-303-III-C-3) At the beginning of the fall semester (at least 3 weeks prior to the initial meeting of the RPT Advisory Committee), the department chair will send a letter to the Student Advisory Committee (SAC) requesting it to prepare recommendations on the faculty members being reviewed. The SAC chair is provided w ith University Policy 6-303, the College's Statement of RPT Standards and Procedures, the University's SAC Faculty Evaluation Report Form, and the University's Guiding Principles for SAC Evaluations of Faculty Members. The SAC should conduct its review in accord with the principles described in the latter document. 4. Notice to Departmental Faculty & Staff (Policy 6-303-III-C-2) At least three weeks prior to the conven ing of the RPT Advisory Committee, the department chair invites faculty and staff members in the department to submit signed, written recommendations for the file of each candidate. The chair's invitation wil l direct faculty and staff to include in any r ecommendation specific reasons for the recommendation. 5. Closing the File/File Contents The RPT file of each candidate should be closed by October 20 (o r an alternative date specified by the RPT Committee chair). It should contain all materials supplied by the candidate; letters from external evaluators (i n formal reviews only); the SAC report; additional letters submitted by other faculty, staff, stude nts, or other interested individuals; and key documents from previous formal and informal reviews. The candidate has the righ t to examine the contents of th e file at any time, except for external evaluator letters if the candidate waived his or her right to see them. The candidate can also add responses to the contents of the file at various times specified below (except to the external evaluator letters if the waiver was signed). The RPT files are kept in a secure location by th e department chair and the files are made available to members of the RPT Advisory Committee upon request. 6. Committee Reviewers The RPT Advisory Committee holds an initial meeting to determine primary and secondary internal reviewers for each candidate. All committee members are expect ed to examine each candidat e's file, but the two design ated internal reviewers chosen from the faculty are charged with thoroughly reviewing all material s in the RPT file and presenting them to the RPT Advisory Committee during the formal review. The primary revi ewer will coordinate this effo rt and the secondary reviewer will assist. 7. Committee Meetings & Votin g (Policy 6-303-III-A-3 & E) The chair of the RPT Advisory Committee calls the RPT formal review meeting(s), preferably by November 1. At least two-thirds of the committee must be present to form a quorum. A ll members of the eligible faculty are encouraged to participate in the formal review process. The Advisory Committee chair chooses a secret ary for the meeting. The secretary records minutes of the meeting. Minutes for each candidate should be ex tensive enough to cover all essential elements of the discussion , but participants in the discussion should not be named or identified in any way. For each candidate, the RPT Advisory Committee votes on summary ratings in three separate performance areas : scholarship and creative work, t eaching, and service. These performance areas are described in Section VI of this document. In addition, separate votes are taken for each action under consideration (reten tion, promotion, and/or tenure). All votes will be open unl ess a majority of the committee decides to utilize secret ballots. Whenever practicable, the department chair shall advise all members on leave or otherwise absent of the proposed actio n and shall request their writte n opinions and votes. Absent members' written opinions shall be disclosed at the meeting and their votes will be counted the same as other votes. Absentee votes must be received prior to the meeti ng at which a vote is taken by the RPT Ad visory Committee. Results of each vote are recorded in the formal minutes of the meeting. 8. Committee Report In formal reviews, the chair of the RPT Advisory Committee pr epares a written summary of the RPT review meeting(s) for the candidate. This summary contains a report on the outcome of all votes, outlines committee recommendations, and provides a brief summary of the contents of the letters from external evalua tors. The summary of letters fr om external evaluators must be made without identifying the evaluators if the candidate waived the right to see the external evaluator letters. The summary report is then shared with all committee members. The committee is given up to five working days to recommend modifications. Copies of the final report are forwarded to the department chair and to the candidate. CA+P 6 9. Chair & Dean Recommendations (Policy 6-303-III-F,G, H, I,; Policy 6-003-III-Sec. 2.C). Subsequent to receiving the final report of the RPT Advisory Committee, the depa rtment chair prepares his or her written recommendations with respect to the candidate, stating specif ically the reasons for the reco mmendations, and sends an exact copy of her/his recommendations to the candidate. The candidate then has the opportunity at this time, but not the obligation, to add a written statement to his/her formal review file in respons e to the summary report of the RPT Advisory Committee and/or the evaluation of the department chair. Written notice of this option will be included with the copy of the chair's recommendation that is sent to the candidate. If the candidate ch ooses to add such a statement to the file, that statement must be submitted to the department chair within seven business days, ex cept in extenuating circumstances, of the date upon which the chair's recommendation is delivered to th e candidate. If the candidate submits a written statement to the department chair with in this time limit, the candidate's statement will be adde d to the review file without comment by the chair. A f t e r t h e d e p a r t m e n t c h a i r h a s p r o v i d e d a n a d e q u a t e o p p o r t u n ity for the candidate to submit a written statement (at least seve n business days), the chair will forward the complete file to the dean. The dean will prepare his or her own written recommendation, with copies to the department chair, the RPT Advisory Committee chair, and the candidate. In formal reviews, the candidate has seven days following receipt of the dean's letter to add responses to the file if he or she wishes to do so. In formal reviews, the dean forwards the complete file, incl uding the RPT Advisory Committee's letter, the chair's letter, the dean's letter, and any responses from the candidate to the Seni or Vice President for Academic A ffairs, who will refer the file to UPTAC. VI. COLLEGE CRITERIA AN D EVALUATION GUIDELINES A. Criteria for Retention. Promotion and Tenure (Policy 6-303-III-A-2) A faculty member's standing in the College is based on three functions: (1) scholarshi p and creative work; (2) teaching; and (3) professional, university, and public servi ce. The assessment may also consider the candidate's conduct as a responsible member of the faculty. Summary ratings of these functions will serve as the criteria for retention, promotion, and tenure. Possible ratings for each function are exceptional, excellent , meritorious, satisfactory, and not satisfactory. The specifics of this rating system are defined below in the sections pertaining to the activities under evaluation. In general, the department's rating of \"excellent\" coincides with the University standard of \"excellent,\" and the department's rating of \"meritorious\" coincides with the University standard of \"sustained effectiveness.\" The criteria for retention at the Assistant Professor rank, tenu re, and promotion to the Associ ate Professor and Professor rank s are listed here. Implicit in the criteria for each level is th e concept that excelling in one area does not compensate for substandard performance in another area. The same criteria apply to both formal and informal reviews. Evaluation guidelines for ratings in scholarship and creative work, teaching, and service are described in subsequent sections. Assistant Professor: Retention at th is rank requires ratings of at least meritorious in either teaching or scholarship and creative work, with at least satisfactory in the two other functions. Associate Professor: Promotion to this rank requires ratings of at least excellent in either teaching or scholarship and creative work, and with a rating of at least meritorious in the each of the other two functions. Professor: Promotion to this rank requires a rating of excellent in teaching and scholarship and creative work, and of at least meritorious in service. An exceptional rating in any performance function will be recognized and taken into consideration in evaluating all candidates. Tenure: The requirements for achieving tenure are the same as those requirements for promotion to Associate Professor. With tenure, a permanent relationship between the faculty member and the University is implied, along with the expectation that the candidate has clearly demonstrated th at he/she will continue to be a productive faculty member over time. In the event that a person is hired at or promoted to the rank of Associate Prof essor before achieving tenure, the subsequent conferral of tenure requires that the faculty member has provided convincing evidence that he or she will continue to achieve the standards expected of an As sociate Professor and is likely to achieve the standards expected for promotion to the rank of Professor. In the event that a person is hired at or promoted to the rank of Professor before achieving tenure, the subsequent conferral of tenure requires that the faculty member has provided convincing evidence that he or she will continue to achieve the standards expected of a Professor. CA+P 7 Evaluation Process and Summary Rankings. An individual's activities in the areas of scholarship and creative work, teaching, and service will be considered in terms of their significance and constancy. The data gathered on a faculty member at the time of consideration for retention, promotion or tenure is considered to be predictive of future activity. The evaluation process occurs in the areas of scholarship and creative work, teachi ng, and service. Within the scholarship and creative work area, evaluation is broken in to three categories: innovation, significan ce, and impact. Candidates receive Level I, II, or III ratings in each of the areas/categories. Summary rankings are determined qualitatively by generally assessing the \"levels\" of output and production for each candidate, with substantive documentation of the determinants for the candidate's ranking. B. Guidelines for the Evaluation of Scholarship and Creative Work Judgments about a faculty member's scholarship and creative work are based on both the quality and quantity of scholarly and creative products. The characteristics of productive scholars hip and creative work can differ as a function of the faculty member's program, special interests and capabilities, areas of re search or creative work, and professional goals. Consequently , there are no strict quantitative criteria for amount and type of scholarly and creative work at the various faculty ranks. Rat her, assessments of faculty scholarship and creative work in the RPT process reflect professional judgments that balance the quality and quantity of contributions and take into acco unt the overall professi onal output and productivity of the faculty member. Quantity of Scholarship and Creative Work Faculty at all ranks are expected to demonstrate a range of scholarly/creative activity commens urate with the ranking, rather than a specific number of activities. Quantity, however, is one measure of accomplishment and is particularly important as a sign of continuity, self motivation, and substantive exploration. Quality of Scholarship and Creative Work Scholarship and creative work is evaluate d with respect to three facets of quality, innovation, significance, and impact . Although these facets are not independent of one another, each defines a different aspect of quality. Overall excellence in scholarship and creative work can be achieved with a variety of products that differ with respect to these quality dimensions. However, judging the quality of scholarly/creative contributions is an essential part of evaluating faculty members in the area of scholarship and creative work, and these facets define the forms of scholarship and creative work that generally signify greate r quality and importance. 1. Innovation The mission of the University is, in part, to create new knowledge. Consistent with this goal, the quality of scholarly/creati ve work is evaluated by the degree to which the candidate's work contributes to new understanding. Three performance levels of innovation are listed below (Levels I-III), reflecting a general orde ring from great to lesser significance. This ordering doe s not imply that the lower levels have no value. All levels represent traditional fo rms of scholarly/creative work that have a place in the various discipline areas contained within the College of Arch itecture and Planning. However, some scholarship and creative work reflect to a higher degree the University mission of creating new knowledge, and the College recognizes the greater significance of these forms. Level I This category includes scholarly/creative products that present new theory, methodology, or empirical evidence. New theory refers to an original proposal/idea that explains a system of behavior or design process, not simply new hypotheses or models of isolated behaviors. New em pirical evidence can be quantitative or qualitative, but the emphasis is on the development of new and original understanding from the data, not merely an empirical description of phenomena. New methodological contributions can take many forms (e.g., research-related methods or methods of professional practice), but to belong in this category, contributions must be novel rather than re-expressions of existing methods. Level II This category includes work that presents a new synthesis of existing knowledge with new implications for future research and theory. CA+P 8 Level III In this category are included scholarly/ creative products that report new empi rical evidence but with little or no development of new conceptual understanding (empirical studies that describe phenomena, e.g., surveys and other descriptive methods, without testing, contrasting, or proposing theoretical explanations fall under this heading); products that summarize existing knowledge (previously generated theory, concepts, methodologies, and/or empirical findings); and products that comment on or review previously published publications and materials. 2. Significance of the Scholarly/Creative Work. The quality of scholarly and creative contributions is judged in pa rt by the type of outlets in which they appear and the level of difficulty in achieving them. Three performance levels of schol arly/creative work are listed belo w in their order of significa nce. Common examples of work within these levels are also listed. The examples are meant to serve only as general guidelines for assessing the significance of the work; some types of scholarship and creative work may not be listed as examples. Each piece of scholarship and/or creative work is ther efore to be considered for its own unique merits relative to this facet of quality. The scholarship and creative work distinctions are not mutually exclusive; candidates may move freely between categories in developing their resumes. Level I Examples of Level I scholarship include but are not limited to authored and edited books from nationally and internationally recognized presses, book chapters in peer-reviewed books, peer-reviewed articles or book reviews in national or international journals, funded international or national research grants or fellowships, major venue exhibition catalogs, and invited/funded international and national addresses and presentations. Examples of Level I creative work include but are not limited to designs that are built or designs that are published in national or international journals, design competition awar ds, funded international or national research grants, exhibiting designs in professional galleries, and invited/funded international or national addresses and presentations. Level II Works at Level II in the area of scholarship include but are not limited to authored and edited books from state and local presses, peer-reviewed article or book review in a state or local journal, local/university grants and fellowships, juried presentations at national/international professional conferences, invited/funded local/university addresses or presentations, and local/university exhibition catalogs. Works at Level II in the creative area include but are not limited to un-built designs, designs published in regional or local journals, international or national design competition entries, local/university crea tive grants and awards, and local/university exhibitions. Level III Works in the Level III category for schola rship include but are not limited to non-juried articles, papers on professional topics for a professional audience, juried lectures or addresses at state and local conferences, invited talks at state and local venues, unfunded grant proposals, articles in the popular press, technical reports, and publication in conference proceedings. Works in the Level III category in the creative area include but are not li mited to funded design consulting, state and local design competition entries. 3. Impact of the Work Judgments of impact (or predicted impact) range from minimal to exceptionally high. These judgments are based on the RPT Advisory Committee members' individual assessments of the work, conclusions from qualified external evaluators, and in some cases other forms of recognition such as awards and honors. The impact of a work may be evident in the degree to which the work has been cited, used, or referred to. CA+P 9 Level I The scholarly or creative work has inspired and changed th e field of study, is referred to as groundbreaking, considered extremely important and/or stimulating and/or challenging, gains national and international recognition, is regularly cited, used or referred to, and emulated. This rating is rese rved for scholarship and creative work of the highest quality. Level II The scholarly or creative work is significant, innovative, an d challenging, attaining a national or state reputation. Work in this category makes a meaningful contribution to a partic ular field of inquiry, is cited and referred to, and is considered above the norm. Level III The scholarly or creative work is not considered a significant contribution to the field, but allows the candidate to enter the field and join in or comment on a body of work or a crea tive trend mostly created by ot hers. Work in this category is not cited or regarded as an example or as advancement in practice. This work may, howe ver, indicate a strong future potential for the candidate in a sustainable and eventually productive area of work. Summary Ranking Scale for Scholarship and Creative Work The ranking below reflects the joint consideration of quantity a nd quality of scholarship and creative work as described above, given the faculty member's time in rank. Exceptional: The candidate clearly stands out as one of the most in novative, productive, and highly-regarded practitioners in their field/fields. This ranking is reserved for rare instances of truly superior work. Excellent : The candidate has made outstanding and sustained schola rly or creative contributions in one or more areas. The contributions are original, consistent over time, and have estab lished the individual as a recogn ized scholar in their areas of research and practice. Meritorious : The candidate has made significant and sustained contri butions in one or more areas of scholarship or creative works. The quality and quantity of scholarship or creative work reflect a substantial, positive impact in at least one area. Satisfactory : The candidate has made some scholarly/creative contributions but the quality or quantity of existing contributions suggest that additional efforts need to be made to be sustainable over time. Not Satisfactory : The candidate's scholarly/cr eative contributions are lacking in quality and quantity. C. Guidelines for the Evaluation of Teaching College faculty are expected to conform to the normal university definition of t eaching, which means that they are expected to perform regularly scheduled instruction (studios, seminars, and lecture classes ), participate in curriculum and program development, direct and evaluate student work, and contribute to the counseling, mentoring, and advising of students in general. Primary materials used in evaluating teachin g performance consist of course evaluations and SAC reports, and may include peer reviews of teaching. Regular teaching assignments are made by th e chair, with the number and nature of c ourses being determined by the role of individual faculty members within the department. It is also r ecognized that student mentoring with respect to professional practice is a high priority in the schola r-practitioner model of educatio n embraced by the professional nature of the College. For this reason, RPT judgments in the College of Architecture and Planning are made primarily in respect to the candidate's contribution to the overall education mission of the college in the following three levels of significance. Level I Activities in this category include engaging students in s timulating, informed, timely, and scholarly course work; employing innovative or especially effective methods of teaching; and receiving consistently high teaching evaluations and strong recommendations from SAC review committees. Other activities in the category include winning national and/or university teaching awards; deve loping new programs and curricula with in the college; being awarded teaching CA+P 10 grants and fellowships; participating in studio ju ries; supervising teaching and research assistants ; raising money for student work through grants and other sources; developing award-winning educational materials (course manuals, software, videos and so forth); and being recognized for work in community continuing education. Level II Activities in this category include attendi ng to teaching duties in a timely an d informed manner; employing effective methods of teaching; receiving above average teaching ev aluations and positive recomme ndations from SAC review committees; and being nominated for teach ing awards, applying for teaching gran ts; and participating regularly in juries and student advising. Other activities include developing course materials (handouts, videos, manuals etc.) that enhance teaching efforts, or teachin g in continuing education programs. Level III Activities in this category include perfor ming at a satisfactory level in teachi ng; receiving average-to-slightly below average evaluations from their students; and having adequate if not laudatory SAC reviews. Summary Ranking Scale for Teaching Rankings on the scale below reflect the join t consideration of the components of teac hing, relative to the faculty member's tim e in rank. The first component reflects the fundamental teaching resp onsibilities of faculty memb ers in this college, and consequently is weighted most heavily. The rankings will consider time in rank. Exceptional: The candidate clearly stands out as a dedi cated, innovative, and gifted scholar-teacher. Excellent : The candidate ranks above others in teaching effectiveness and performance, and has demonstrated leadership and creativity in development of his or her teaching. Meritorious: The candidate is an effective teacher with good review s and performance, and aspires to continuing personal development in teaching. Satisfactory: The candidate is a less effective teacher than indicated fo r time in rank, but has strong potential for improvement. Not Satisfactory : The candidate has made insufficient contributions in the area of teaching given time in rank. D. Guidelines for the Evaluation of Service The viability of the College of Architecture and Planning and its departments depends in part on its ability to maintain an act ive presence in the University system, to represent itself within th e larger professional communities, and to maintain itself as a public resource in the region and the world. Although this can be achieved partially through faculty research and teaching, public and professional service is another important mechanism for maintaining this presence. \"Community\" service can also include teaching service learning c ourses or community-based studios. Evaluations are made with respect to thre e aspects of service: (1) professional service, (2) university service, and (3) commun ity or public service. Note: \"Professional\" refers to both the professions of architecture and planning, and to the scholarly profession. It is not necessary for a faculty member to part icipate equally in all three service areas. Differing participatio n in the three service areas typically reflects the unique strengths and interests of faculty members and the different program foci. Level I Professional: Service in this category is with internati onal or national professional organizations and includes such activities as holding offices, participating in the organization or operation of conferences, serving as chair, discussant, or reviewer for presentations at professional meetings, serving on various professional committees, panels, or boards (e.g., accreditation boards), and attending and presenting pr ofessional workshops. Signi ficant professional service contributions can also include serving as editor, associate editor, editorial revi ew board member, or regular reviewer for international and national scholarly or professional journals or design competitions. University: Service in this category includes such things as serving on special university search and advisory committees, chairing univers ity committees, serving in administrative positions in the University, College or Department or representing the Univers ity in national or regional activities. CA+P 11 Community: Service on international or national boards or as chair of a significant national or regional organization, or exceptional local leadership and time commitment to local community organizations, including volunteer design work. Level II Professional: Service in this category is with smaller regional or local organizations and includes such activities as holding offices, participating in the organization or operation of conferences, serving as a presenter at conferences or meetings, serving on committees, panels, or boards, and presenting professional workshops. Professional service contributions at this level also include serving as editor, associate editor, editorial review board member, or regular reviewer for regional and local journals and design competitions. University: Service in this category includes membership in important university committees or Academic Senate, chairing of department or college committees, including ad hoc and search committees, and significant contributions to the administration of the unit. Community: Includes service in regional activities and boards in a leadership position, continuous and influential service to a local organization or assisting with community events. Level III Professional: Service in this category in cludes attendance at meetings, participation as an active member, serving as discussant, or reviewer for presentations at professional meetings. University: Includes membership on college committees and special college-level ad ministrative assignments. Community: Includes short-term, intense service to organiza tions, membership and general participation in local or regional organizations over an extended period of time, act ivism like letters to the editor or interviews on community issues. Summary Ranking Scale for Service. Rankings on the scale below reflect the join t consideration of service contributions in the three areas, relative to the facult y member's time in rank. Exceptional: The candidate has made an extraordinary commitment to service in all three areas. Excellent : The candidate has made outstanding and sustained contributions in at least one area of serv ice. The faculty member's service contributions have distinguished him/her as a recognized leader in the profession, University, or community. Meritorious: The candidate has made significant contributions to his/her profession, the University, and/or the community through professional service. Satisfactory: The faculty member shows sufficient commitment to service in at least on e area, suggesting th at the eventual contributions of the faculty member will be significant. Not Satisfactory : The candidate has made insufficient contributions in the area of service given time in rank. CA+P 12 VII.

The Statement may be implemented for RPT proceedings in your College for the academic year 2013-2014 (as of July 1, 2013). Congratulations on completing the approval process, and revisi ng your Statement to comply with University Policies and to serve well the missions of your College and the University. The UR PTSC was pleased to see the Co llege include peer review as one possible method of evaluating teaching performance. The Committee feels strongly that peer observation and evaluation of teaching is a \"best practice,\" and would enco urage the College in the next revision of its Statement to require such observatio n in the RPT review process, particularly for all formal reviews. Many departments and colleges do so already or are moving in that direction. Please ensure that a copy of this approval notice is attached to all copies of the final approved version of the RPT Statement. Two further steps should be taken to ensure an orderly transition from using the version of your department Statement in effect until now, to using this newly approved Statement. First, all current faculty members who will in the future undergo formal reviews for retention, promotion, or tenure should have their attention directed to the passage within the new Statement which describes the \"Implementation Date and Application to Existing Faculty,\" and provides for certain procedures in making the transition from old to new. Second, those existing faculty member s who are currently still in th eir pre-tenure RPT probationary period are requested to complete the \"RPT Transition Choice Fo rm\" prior to the start of their next formal review, indicating their choice of having the remaining reviews conducted under the terms of the old or ne w Statement. That form is available from the office of the Vice President.

Although there is a tremendous amount of work on the impact of gender and race on architecture, this work is largely critical. The ultimate goal of my project is to bring together critical theory and the productive creation of architecture through the development of performative theory as a tool which can be used within a methodology of analysis and design.

Introduction to Architectural Theory: ARCH 6275 Architecture is a form of representation and cultural production. In order to approach critical theories in architecture this lecture class surveys modern texts and positions from the mid-19th Century to the most recent developments of our time. Intensive Architectural Studio: ARCH 6012 The course will focus on three basic questions that link architecture, cinema, and the city - the question of representations of cities, the question of subjectivity and how it is constructed through space and place, and finally, the notion of (con) text, architectural and other. Architectural Skill Development Studio: ARCH 3010/4011/6013 The Architectural Skill Development Studio is an intensive, comprehensive semester created to develop an understanding of the design process. Community Design Studio: ARCH 6016 The Community Engagement Studio will work with the Salt Lake School for the Performing Arts to help them achieve their goals, of continued appropriation and occupation of their current space, and the development of a new facade and small community theatre for the campus. Final Studio ARCH 6971 This is a capstone studio that requires a systematic exploration of a city precinct considered as an architectural project following from problem definition, to city and site analysis, entitlement review, programming, precedence analysis, schematic and design development culminating in the presentation of a cohesive design strategy intended to transform the chosen problem. Community Design Studio: ARCH 6016 The Community Engagement Studio will design two projects both working with community partners and develop one research paper on community engagement. The first project will be the retrofit of a warehouse that will serve as the Utah Tibetan Community Center. The Second project will be the Heartland Live/Learn Center designed in collaboration with the Hartland Partnership Center. Architectural Design Studio III ARCH 4010/6010 This studio will facilitate the development of design and technical skills as students deepen their research abilities and understanding of the design process. Urban Design Sstudio I: ARCH 6030 This urban design studio will explore residential development opportunities in downtown Salt Lake City.ASHLEY IORDANOV EXPERIENCEPROFILEArchitect Prescott Muir Architects 2015 - Present I work on residential and commercial designs.

My parents taught me to respect and enjoy nature. Stewardship of the natural environment was just part of my agrarian upbringing. As a competi - tive skiing athlete, I learned the valuable relationship between talent and effort. I moved to Utah in 2001 to work for the Olympic Winter Games; and fell in love with the Wasatch mountains. After the games I served as the program director for Nordic Sport Programs at the Utah Olympic Park before making my way into architecture. PERSONAL PROFILEAnne G.

He spent four years in New York City working for such notable firms as Richard Meier & Partners and Kohn Pedersen Fox involved in commercial, civic and residential projects including Canal + Headquarters in Paris, KNP Corporate offices in the Netherlands, The Getty Center in Los Angeles, U.S. Court House in Manhattan and numerous other projects and product designs. He moved from New York City to Jackson, Wyoming in 1993 to open his practice because of a strong interest in western regionalism, vernacular imagery and materials. His practice in Jackson spanned fourteen years, producing numerous works which include custom residences and public housing, restaurant and retail, commercial and civic projects. He closed Tobler Duncker Architects in 2007 with a successful transition of ownership to pursue architectural goals of expanded scale and scope and is currently practicing in Portland, Oregon.

professional competency for entry -level employment in the building industry. For those seeking work at the graduate level, it provides a thorough preparation for a professionally -accredited Master of Architecture program, or studies in related environmental design fields. The program requires two years of liberal arts education during which students will take a number of pre - architecture requirements. Once admitted into the major after the sophomore year, students take a number of required courses which provide a broad introduction to the field of architecture and a solid foundation for the development of individualized programs at the graduate level. NEW BSAS CURRICULUM CURRENT (OLD) BSAS CURRICULUM BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN MULTI -DISCIPLINARY DESIGN http://design.cap.utah.edu/programs/ Using product design as a vehicle to inv estigate design research, human -centered design principles, interface development, articulation of product forms, and materials and d igital manufacturing principles, t he MDD program has at its core the shared fundamental understanding of the language, process s, and application of design and design thinking. This proposes to use design as a verb for activities rooted in 4 cornerstones: Engagement, Community, Collaboration and Responsibility. This broad perspective allows for students to see the connections between these design specialties and focus on the process of design as a creative idea and development framework. It expands students' horizons by engaging with other design disciplines in strategic and collaborative ways. This approach can lead to exciting new design engagement that can deeply engage the world as it is and as it is be coming. MASTER OF ARCHITECTURE: TWO -YEAR http://soa.cap.utah.edu/degrees/graduate/march/ The Master of Architecture (M.Arch ) is a first accredited professional degree that provides students with a comprehensive education leading to the practice of architecture. It is designed to allow students opportunities to prepare for specialization in the field in the areas of architectur al design and representation, architectural technologies and building performance, architectural history /theory/criticism, digital fabrication , and historic preservation . The new two -year M.Arch curriculum (depicted combined with the 3+ curriculum) is show n below and the current (old) two -year M.Arch curriculum appears on the following page. NEW TWO -YEAR M.ARCH CURRICULUM CURRENT (OLD) TWO -YEAR M.ARCH CURRICULUM MASTER OF ARCHITECTURE: 3+ http://soa.cap.utah.edu/degrees/graduate/march -3/ The 3+ Master of Architecture program is designed for students who do not have an undergraduate degree in architecture. The program can be completed by students in just over three years of study and prepares students for professional practice as an architect. The Master of Architecture (M.Arch) is a first accredited professional degree that provides students with a comprehensive education le ading to the practice of architecture. It is designed to create opportunities for students and faculty to make meaningful connections between the diff erent areas of instruction - design , history/theory/criticism, building technology, communicat ions, and professional practice . The new 3+ M.Arch curriculum (combined with the two -year curriculum) is show below and the current (old) 3+ M.Arch curriculum appears on the following page. NEW 3+ M.ARCH CURRICULUM CURRENT (OLD) 3+ M.ARCH CURRICULUM (first year only) MASTER OF SCIENCE IN ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES http://soa.cap.utah.edu/degrees/graduate/msas/ The MSAS program is designed for students seeking education in a specialty area (Historic Preservation, Architectural T echnology, Project Delivery ) of architectural practice or as a consulting specialist. The program can be completed by students in approximately two years of study and pre pares students for professional practice in a specialty area of architecture. This degree is not accredited to gain licensure for practice as an architect or other field requiring professional licensing. The MSAS program is a 36 credit hour (3 -4 semester ) program of study. The program is characterized by choice and flexibility. The student assembles a program tailored to his/her individual inter ests. Each track includes of five academic areas (Introductory Seminar, Research Methods , Content & Methods, Area Cognates, and Master's Project). The student selects from course areas to meet required semester hours. Extra work in an academic area is applied as cognate elective. GRADUATE CERTIFICATE IN HISTORIC PRESERVATION http://soa.cap.utah.edu/preservation/ Historic preservation is a broad -based practice encompassing architecture, planning, historic research, and public administration. Trends in sustainability and stewardship of the built environment are expected to expand and require practitioners who are familiar with the opportunities and synergies that historic preservation can create. Opportunities in historic preservation continue to grow as the inter -relationship between property owners, architects , engineers, construction professionals, planners, public administrators, historians, and the public become more complex. The program is a forum for developing skills used in the interdisciplinary practice of historic preservation. The certificate complem ents the Master of Architecture (M.Arch ), Master of City & Metropolitan Planning (M CMP), Master of Pub lic Administration (M PA) and graduate degrees in History and seeks to provide opportunities for graduate students throughout the University of Uta h to learn more about historic preservation. The program also is open to professionals not enrolled at the University to enhance their professional development.

With a more recent modernization period than most Western countries, it is still steeped in the patriarchal ideas of the past. With increasing rates of divorce and a growing number of single women in Japan needing to support their families, many find it hard to enter the male -dominated, h ierarchical workforce. Those who manage to do so often strugg le to find much success. With a similarly high rate of domestic violence in Japan, as well as a rapidly growing population specifically on the island of Tsukishima, I am proposing a Women and Children's Center and on the island of Tsukishima in Tokyo. It will combine a small domestic violence emergency shelter with a resource center and daycare as an additional support to women. The resource center provides courses to develop technical and leadership skills, domestic violence and career counseling, and r esources to work toward both personal and career goals such as job search and resume and interview assistance. In conjunction with the architecture which will promote empowerment for women and children, an education component will be included in the progr am which focuses on advocacy and empowerment for Japanese women in the workforce. The final component of my program will be a rooftop park to replace the park that exists currently on the site, creating a community gathering space for the island of Tsukis hima and strengthening the connection to the Sumida River by bridging the floodwall to facilitate easy access to the waterfront. H.2 FINAL M.ARCH STUDIO PROJECT: KATJA LUND , 2018 WATER ECOLOGY CENTER : AN EXPRESSION OF WATER - POLLUTION. EDUCATION. PRESERVATION. ABSTRACT This project is a water ecology center in Tsukishima, Japan. The project is sited on the north -west side of the island on an existing park that is elevated from the ocean to the north and from the canal to the south. The site will encompass the urbanscape (the park and walkways). The water ecology center will have an active stormwater pollution cleanup system, a testing and solutions lab, as well as a water education center. Each part of the program will be transparent to the public. Water is our most precious resource and should be understood economically, environmentally, and culturally. H.3 FINAL M.ARCH STUDIO PROJECT: MATT MYERS , 2018 BRINGING CULTURAL TRADITIONS BACK TO THE HISTORIC CENTER: A MARKET HALL AND ARTS & CRAFTS CENTER IN MEXICO CITY ABSTRACT A master plan of the site near the Palacio de Bellas Artes in the Historic Center of Mexico City will consist of a market hall and a center for traditional Mexican arts and crafts. These will be done in different phases and contain educational facilities for the public to learn about the production of traditional Mexican foods, arts and crafts. This idea of a learning type facility will help to connect the people of Mexico back to their historic roots. This building will facilitate community engagement and interaction and provide the city with more places for vend ors to buy and sell their goods. A proposal paper was done to state my reasoning for this type of building and the appropriateness for the site chosen. A site analysis was done to better understand the surrounding conditions. Programming diagrams and spati al layouts helped to find the type of spaces within the building and their relationships with each other. Finally, a series of precedents were researched to gain a better understanding of the proposed building typology. H.4 FINAL M.ARC H STUDIO PROJECT: MICHELLE HOWARD, 2017 SHAXI ART CENTER; CULTURAL PRESERVATION AND SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH ART AND BUSINESS EDUCATION AND ART TOURIS M ABSTRACT Revealing spatial and historical layers, the Shaxi Art Center celebrates the artistic heritage of the Bai and other minority people in Yunnan Province, China. The adobe/plaster courtyard walls enclose the articulated timber structure within. Acting as an object within a void, the courtyard gallery is the cent erpiece of the Art Center. By encouraging artistic tourism, the Art Center continues Shaxi's traditional market role on the ancient Tea -Horse trail. H.5 FINAL M.ARC H STUDIO PROJECT: MICH AEL MCCLELLAN , 2017 DEFINING THE THRESHHOLD: A MODERN LIBRARY I N AN ANCIENT TOWN ABSTRACT The Shaxi Tea Library was designed with that purpose in mind: to reinf orce threshold by juxtaposing material and form. By intersecting and juxtaposing form and material, architecture is able to define physical, visual, and psychological thresholds. As a secondary objective, threshold refers to accessibility and that idea of accessibility has to be renewed within the program, at both physical and social levels. The entire path, around and through the library needs to be accessible so that all can come and enjoy a building that will become central to their community. H.6 FINAL MSAS PROJECT: ZAHRA GHORBANI , 2017 POST -TENSIONED WOOD SYSTEMS ABSTRACT Many researchers have recommended different strategies for sustainable structures to exploit natural resources more efficiently and moderate the environmental impact of on -site construction. This research presents a creative, sustainable construction appro ach through an intelligent assembly system for eco-friendly materials. Wood is a natural material that is vastly available and easily reproduced in temperate climate zones. Wooden structures offer the opportunity to provide sustainable building through th eir eco -friendly features and life cycle recycling. Wood has a very positive carbon footprint, and heavy timber structures postpone releasing stored carbon within wood for decades or longer. While wood life cycle is in the line of built environment, but th e structural performance of wood is impressive reason to be applied to more building. There are many old traditional wooden structures still standing around the world in good condition as a result of timber's structural behavior to tolerate and transfer ex tra loads. Moreover, these days, there is a possibility to use engineered wood and advanced fabrication technologies to create innovations in heavy timber architecture. The National Research Council (NRC) has offered a different and efficient approach to r emedy the existing situation. The assembly system is recommended as one solution \"to exploit the greatest potential and advance the competitiveness and productivity of the U.S. construction industry in the next 20 years\" (National Academies Press, 2009). The theory of post -tensioning assembly systems (PTAS) in smart architecture is not only providing a new vision of flexible methods of on -site construction but can also present an image of the easy disassembly system. It moderates between the enhancement of the architectural concepts and the optimization of structural designs to improve the traditional construction approach. It relies on smart architecture that is responding to post -tensioning forces of tendon material in the assembly hierarchy. The post -tensioned structure is mainly preassembled off -site so that upon arrival to the site it can be easily affixed into position. As a result, if the modules are disconnected, the modules can be packaged again for recycling. So, it is possible to say, materials i n the post -tensioned heavy timber structure are deposited as long as the existing building is desired, and then it can be re -adapted to the occupant's needs and new function, or it is also flexible to recycle. Hopefully, the benefits of this approach encou rage more builders to consider the recycled wooden structure. This research has been done by studying about traditional wooden construction, post -tensioned systems, and types of assembly approach in nature to find out the method of PTAS and its advantages for recycled buildings. H.7 FINAL MSAS PROJECT: ARDAVAN TOOKALOO, 2016 POST OCCUPANCY EVALUATION: A CASE STUDY OF BEVERLEY TAYLOR SORENSEN ARTS AND EDUCATION COMPLEX ABSTRACT Post -occupancy evaluation (POE) is a process of assessing building performance for its users and intended function during occupati on. User satisfaction impacts the performance of educational environments and their users: students, faculty and staff. In addition, buildings are maintained and managed by teams that spend large amount of time and capital in their long -term sustenance. By evaluating the feedback from users of higher education facilities, university planning departments are more prepared to understand the inputs for programming and future project planning. In addition, university buildings will be closer to meeting user and maintenance needs. This thesis reports on research team made up of academics, facility personnel and users that have developed a plan to improve the quality of campus facilities through a POE exercise on a recently built project. This study utilized a pro cess of focus group interviews representing the different users, and subsequent survey. The thesis demonstrates both the theory and practice of POE in higher education and learning environment through the case example of the University of Utah POE exercise . H.8 FINAL MSAS PROJECT: BRANDON TOPONCE, 2015 DESIGNING OGDEN: THE LIFE AND WORK OF LESLIE S. HODGSON ABSTRACT \"Therefore, when we build, let us not think that we build forever. Let it not be for present delight nor for present use alon e: let it be such work as our descendants will thank us for, and us think, as we lay stone on stone, that a time is to come when those stones will be held scared because our hands have touched them, and that men will say as they look upon the labor and wro ught substance of them, 'see! This our fathers did for us.' For indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones or in its gold. It s glory is in the Age.\" John Ruskin This quote by John Ruskin hung on the office wall of Leslie S. Hodgson, t he most well -known architect in Ogden, Utah. Hodgson's work truly held up to every word in this ideal of a structure lasting forever. Now as the years fade away, his buildings will stand as a beacon to the community and a memory of the man who designed O gden. The following document will give the reader a brief glimpse of the man who designed Ogden Leslie S, Hodgson. His life and those who influence his architectural understanding is discussed with a clarified understanding of the historical reference of a society and what was occurring within Utah at that time. Next comes a specific description of his works in Ogden with detail specifically given to those that are considered significant to Hodgson's career or to the community. This work concludes by addr essing a call to action concerning the work of Hodgson so that society can understand why it must preserve their history and how it is to be accomplished. H.9 FINAL MSAS PROJECT: DAVID S. WRIGHT , 2015 HISTORIC TEMPLE SQUARE, SALT LA KE CITY UT: A CULTURAL LANDSCAPE REPORT ABSTRACT The focus of this study is Temple Square, located in Salt Alake City, Utah. Temple Square is a Ten-acre parcel enclosed by a circumscribing fifteen foot wall and is bounded on the north by North Temple Street, on the south by South Temple Street, on the west by West Temple Street, and on the east by the Main Street Plaza. Temple Square is listed as a National Historic Landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. This federal designation is emblematic of T emple Square's important historical background and the LDS Church is looking for ways to protect its status. While much literature has been written about the Temple and the Tabernacle separately, less literature exists regarding the Square as a whole. Th is cultural landscape report will identify and trace the evolution of the Square since its initial conception through to modern day to illuminate historical influences and provide future management recommendations. The research for this project came in three different approaches. First, topical research included regular visits to the LDS Church History Library to investigate bibliographies, relevant encyclopedias, scholarly and popular journals, personal journals, and various books on the topic. Second , site investigations included regular visits to Temple Square to photograph and measure the site and buildings. Lastly, personal interviews with longtime gardener and church landscape architect Peter Lassig, the current gardening staff, Church History Dep artment staff, Cory Jensen of the Utah SHPO, and others. The report addresses the historic background, the existing conditions, and an inventory of elements currently found on Temple Square. The report concludes with an analysis and recommendation for fu ture development and management of Temple Square. H.10 FINAL MSAS PROJECT: HANNAH M. TURPEN , 201 4 TREMONTON CITY RECONNAISSANCE LEVEL SURVEYS ABSTRACT Tremonton City approached the University of Utah College of Architecture + Planning in regards to contracting a student to conduct a reconnaissance level survey of the downtown commercial district and adjoining residential blocks. The reconnaissance level survey of the downtown commercial district and adjoining residential blocks in Tremonton City, Utah includes the documentation and identification of 208 buildings and sites, the evaluation of the historic significance of the 208 buildings and sites, and fi ndings and recommendations based on the evaluation of the historic significance of the 208 buildings and sites. The purpose of this Reconnaissance Level Survey was to document and inventory the architecture of the downtown core of Tremonton City, Utah and to update the information in the statewide database of historic resources that is managed by the Utah State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). The survey identifies the historic context of the downtown commercial district and adjoining residential block s and makes recommendations for further preservation efforts within the survey boundary for use by Tremonton City. Within the survey boundary, all 208 structures/resources were evaluated based on their significance and given a determination of eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places based on their current physical condition and their status as either contributing or non-contributing. The criteria used for determining their status as either contributing or non - contributing included the ident ification of physical alteration after the historic period based on photographic evidence, property tax information, and use of non -historic/incompatible materials. The survey provides Tremonton City with a record of analysis of the historic resources as o f August 2014 as a baseline for future historic preservation efforts and as a means of determining the need for amendments to the Land Management Code. The Tremonton City Manager determined the boundaries of the Tremonton City Reconnaissance Level Survey i n February 2014. The borders of the survey are located on the north side of 200 North, the north side of 300 South, the west side of 200 East, and the west side of 300 West (see Map 1). The reconnaissance level survey fieldwork was conducted in August of 2 014. 1 Appendix I SoA >onZane Program Planning APPENDIX I INDEX I.1 I.2 /.SOA LONG RANGE PLAN COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL RECRUITMENT PLAN \u0012ODWZ H ES /s Z '/OE\u0004L Z \u0012Zh/TD ET WL\u0004E 2 I.1 SoA Long Range Plan 2015-16 SoA Long Range Planning 2015 Fall R etreat (held 8:30 am - 2:00 pm on August 29, 2015, at City Creek Center) The CA+P's SMART goals form the foundation for the SoA long range plan, with the eight goals listed below identified as the primary focus for the 2015 -16 academic year. The faculty explored specific strategies for achieving these goals, as well as which committees would be tasked with each initiative. Committee Chairs are responsible for determining a reasonable time frame for accompli shing each initiative and assigning members of the committee to each task. Committee Chairs will report progress on each goal to the School of Architecture Leadership Team twice a semester. SoA Committees: School of Architecture Faculty Council (SoAFC) School of Architecture Curriculum Committee (SoACC) Admissions, Recruiting, and Diversity Committee (ARDC) Policy and Grievance Committee (P&G) Academic Culture and Outreach Committee (ACOC) School of Architecture Leadership Team (SoALT) CA+P Leadership : College of Architecture + Planning Leadership Team (CAP LT) Associate Dean of Research & Com munity Engagement (ADR&C E) 1) Accreditation : Have a successful architectural accreditation visit in Spring 2016 by receiving a full term from the NAAB. Perform a dry run for accreditation at the en d of the fall semester. Invite reviewers with experience on NAAB Visiting Teams . Incorporate t his process into our end of semester evaluation of student work to ensure continued compliance with SPCs in the interim betwe en visits. (SoA Faculty) 2) Retention : Increase the number of students receiving assistantships, internships , and other compensated professional experiences by 50 percent by AY2018. Identify a school internship/assistantship coordinator. (SoA Leadership /ARDC) Incorporate a process where admissions requirements and processes include consideration of scholarship funds for incoming students. (ARDC) 3) Recruitment : Raise the average ACT of admitted undergraduate students to 24.5 or higher by 2017 and 25.0 b y 2019. Focus on university recruitment advisors and high school advisors to make sure they hav e accurate information about our program and our specific requirements so they are better able to help students find us. (ACOC) 3 Re-evaluate prerequisites to ma ke sure they are inviting potential students and not scaring them off. (SoACC) Develop a Block U program and an architecture m inor, which encourage students to take our prerequisites and consider coming into the program. (SoACC) o A Block U allows students to enroll in courses that are organized thematically to maximize their learni ng. Courses are selected to allow students to work in a learning community of excellent teachers, peer mentors, and peer advocates. o An architecture minor would provide an additio nal path through our program for students who would like to have a more broadly focused undergraduate degree and the potential enter into the 3+ program for graduate work. 4) Interdisciplinary Learning : Implement a meaningful set of interdisciplinary lear ning experiences for our students by fall 2016. Partner more fully with the planning and design programs to develop a series of collaborative nested studio experiences in which a planning studio will present work on a community plan to serve as the found ation for an architecture studio, and then architecture students will present their work to design students to inspire a product design (and vice -versa). Students will collaborate at the beginning of each semester to understand their relationship to their allied fields. (SoALT) The a nnual theme is an important aspect of interdisciplinary teaching in our school. We should find ways to take bett er advantage of this structure to create interdisciplinary opportunities connecting to units inside and outside of t he college. (ACOC/SoACC) Develop an interdisciplinary PhD program. (SoACC ) 5) Design -Build/Community Engagement : By Spring 2016, have a plan for building upon and advancing t he core mission of DesignBuild BLUFF (DBB) to provide design -build service learnin g involving students and communities in need. Develop plans and potential si tes for a downtown studio space(s) , which can be both active studios and display spaces to highlight the work we do in the SoA. (SoALT) Develop a set of guidelines and policy for community engagement including a list of resourc es offered by Univers ity Neighborhood Partners to assist faculty in developing new opportunities for serving communities in the Salt Lake Area. (ACOC/P&G) 6 External Financial Support : Increase our external support (gifts, grants, contracts) to over $2 million annually by AY2018. Engage faculty and students in development meetings and process. (SoALT) Make a transparent process to empower faculty, students, and potential donors , including creat ing resource s like a development handbook. (SoALT/P&G) Coordinate lectures, events, and activities with a devel opment calendar to create cross -fertilization and open greater opportunities to connect with donors. (SoALT/ACOC) 7) Research /Grantspersonship : Bring in at least one post -doc who will enhance the research and grantspersonship of our research centers for AY2016. 4 Compile and maintain a common list of resources for grants and grant writing offered by the University and the Office of Sponsored Projects. ( ADR&CE ) Take advantage of the excellence of Dialectic to spur research and grant writing. (SoA Faculty) 8) New Modes of Learning : By AY 2017, create a program for learning spaces within our existing building that fosters the ability to collaboratively engage in new modes of learning, thinking and making. Consider this program for learning spaces as a series of prototypes which allow the development and testing of the spaces to be a collaborative learning process in itself. (SoACC) Evaluate existing models on th e campus and elsewhere. (CAP LT/SoACC) Encourage our faculty to take fuller advantage of the support services offered by CTLE . (SoALT) Explore opportunities for digital collaboration which would allow the range of collaborative partners to expand to a nati onal or international scope. (SoACC/ACOC) Continue to explore the possibilities provided by digital fabrication for innovative ways to think, create, and collaborate on architectural projects. (SoACC) Develop an MSAS degree in digital fabrication/programmi ng. (SoACC) 5 I.2 RECRUITMENT PLAN 2014 -2015 PURPOSE The purpose of this plan is to identify outcomes regarding the development of a comprehensive admission , recruitm ent, and placement plan to guide immediate efforts in improving the student experience . In recent years, the College of Architecture + Planning (CA+P) has observed a steady decline in student enrollment. Increasing competition, mission deferment, demographic shifts, declining funding, and disinterest may all be causes for this downward trend. According to current enrollment data , over 600 students take CA+P courses through the School of Architecture, Department of City and Metropolitan Planning , and Multi-Disciplinary Design Program . Only about 334 u ndergraduate students matriculate into minor, pre-major, and major programs towards a Bachelor's Degree and about 111 graduate students pursue Graduate Certificates, Masters and Doctorates degrees.2 It will be increasingly important for CA+P to identify ways to support students as they show interest and matriculate into undergraduate and graduate programs. Although t here are a myriad of activities already in place which attract, engage, and enroll students in each program , this document lists a series of recommended actions that, it is hoped will improve recruitment activities, engage students in their learning, transition them smoothly into their profession, and mainta in their involvement as alumni.

In some areas, the document merely confirms existing practice; in other areas, it suggests changes to current practice; in still others, it recommends the creation of new structures and procedures. The Recru itment & Admissions Officer will introduce students to CA+P through the recruitment and admissions p hases . As students attend orientation, they are then introduced to their Academic Advisor who will offer support through advising and placement. A collabora tive effort from department faculty, staff, and other on -campus offices will ensure that students receive the resources and information they need to be successful throughout their experience at the University . RECRUITMENT The process o f recrui ting studen ts is a result of two sub -functions: Name Recognition and Making the Sale . The point of name recognition is to make potential students aware of the CA+P brand and to provide them with a little information about what we have to offer. The object is to rais e interest in our program and to cause a potential applicant to seek further information. It is, in a word, marketing. Once prospective applicants are aware that our program exists and that we might have something that would interest them, we need to prov ide easily obtainable information that will help convince them t hat Utah is their best option. Since CA+P programs appeal to different audiences, it is important that recruitment be implemented strategically on different levels. These may be categorized so as to target (1) High School students; (2) Freshm en and Transfer students; (3) Diverse students; and (4) prospective Graduates students. In 2013, the CA+P Academic Advisor began implementing an earlier version of this document. From this data shown in figure 4 , we can begin to consider the effectiveness of each type of recruitment activity and evaluate which activities we choose to implement moving forward. HIGH SCHOOL RECRUITM ENT It has become increasingly important to introduce high school art, design, and technology students to the degree programs offer ed at CA+P . Many high school students possess the skill and interest to pursue an education in creative careers but may not be aware of the potential these professions have for shaping the built environment. Outreach and recruitment activities should target local and regional high schools , since most students come to the University from in -state schools . High school students should be encouraged very early to visit the University campus where they can connect with fac ulty and current architecture/planning/design students. Figure 3: FLOW OF STUDENT EXPERIENCE 40% 21% 21% 18% SCHOOL DISTRICTS 20133 3 As much as possible we need to build relationships with high s chool teachers and counselors in the following disciplines: Geome try, Trigonometry, Algebra, Pre -calculus, P hysics, D Painting, Sculpture, Photography , Drafting, English, and History . High school counselors in the Intermountain West could alert their students interested in arch itecture and planning about our prerequisites to bring regional attention to our programs. FRESHM EN/TRANSFE R RECRUITMENT While some of our students begin their studies here as new freshman , others transfer from different majors or other schools within the region. Additionally, students already enrolled in courses but unsure of which major fits their interests, may not be aware of CA+P programs. Since 2 out of 3 CA+P undergraduate programs have closed admissions, it will be vital for students to begin pre-requisite courses early in their academic years. Current University enrollment data indicates that over 2 ,000 students campus -wide are undeclared majors. Additionally, 72 % of f irst- time freshman and 87% of new transfers are from Utah.4 Increasing visibility on -campus and in the community will be effective and low-cost options for recruitment. University Arti culation agreements with other regional schools outline which relevant credits may transfer for each major program. So far, Architecture and Planning are the only published transfer guides. As much as possible, CA+P should be seeking opportunities to colla borate with transfer schools as well as updating transfer guides as changes in curriculum are made. DIVERSITY RECRUITMEN T Students from diverse backgrounds and so -called \"non -traditional\" backgrounds present a new dynamic through sharing their pe rspectives and becoming more engaged in shaping our built environment. About 77% of CA+P students are white and approximately 72% are male . In the recruitment stages, it is important to consider the needs of students from diverse backgrounds as many may be new to higher education and require added encouragement and resources to be successful. New initiatives like BlockU and LEAP offer students mentorship in smaller cohorts called learning communities. So far DES 2615 and CMP 2010 are part of BlockU programs and LEAP courses are offered through Urban Ecology and Architecture. The Arch itecture LEAP is primarily for women and other underrepresented communities starting new this Fall 2014 . It is hoped that these new initiatives paired with assistance from faculty memb ers will be effective recruiting tools for students with diverse backgrounds. The Graduate School a lso offers Celebrate 7: CA+P STUDENTS BY ETHNICITY 20135 4 Mini-grants to bring scholars and other speakers to campus. Grants are used for honorariums, travel expenses, and other related costs. Proposals for an activity or speaker awards funds up to $1,000. GRADUATE RECRUITMENT Graduate students are essential contributors to the University's mission to educate the individual and to discover, refine, and disseminate knowledge. While admissions can be quite competitive, g raduate students still make up 27% of CA+P's student enrollment and about 60 graduate students complete their degrees each year. CA+P offers a wide range of options for the part -time and full -time graduate student, which can broaden recruitment to span from college seniors to city officials and everything in between. Offering professional certificates as well as accelerated and joint degrees make CA+P programs more competitive in attracting students wanting to maximi ze the return on their investment. Begin to collect data on what factors students consider in choosing a graduate school, long -term goals, and how they discovered CA+P programs to customize our recruitment approach. Since many students find CA+P program s through referrals or online searches , website content should be monitored and updated often. The most effective tool in recruiting graduate students is offering financial support . Seek out departmental and private scholarships through the financial aid o ffice to leverage existing resources. RECRUITMENT ACTIVITI ES Improve the Website to effectively sell the program and the place; consider including: i Information for prospective high school students along with outreach events ; i Information about the special q ualities of Salt Lake City and Utah; i Create a \"Request Information\" website link which will allow an interested student to download or request by mail a serie s of brochures, pamphlets, etc. i Create Student Testimonials Students relate best when they see others who have similar academic paths. Showcase internships, projects, and activities. Create a Month ly Newsletter in both electronic and paper for m, providing upcoming events, student clubs information about our program and the Salt Lake region (essentially, a concise version of the web -based info). This newsletter will contain information from Public Relations, Advising, and Career Services . Design an overall College -wide booklet that can be adjusted to house program bookmarks . Make these materials available to the Admissions office for student s expressing interest in CA+P program s. Engage faculty an d student \"mentors\" to be available to guide prospective students throughout their academic experience. Very often students begin academic programs unprepared and inexperienced. Mentors can provide added support whether it be recommendations on design prog rams they should learn or professional career advice. Creating these relationships will be crucial in effective recruitment.

Be sure to include skills that may be helpful in major, AP courses, and tear-off contact cards to be placed on listserv. Youth Education hosts workshops throughout the summer. These include Junior Architects, Senior Architects and Model Building. Distribute bookmarks/swag and begin to track data from year to year as students return. Design Information Posters that present the advantages of a U of U CA+P education (i.e., selling the program, not outlining the details of the curriculum/degree requirements - the most recent brochure does this well). Visit feeder schools to present program information and distribute to printed materials. On-site advising sessions are encouraged to connect individually with students. Maintain relationships with faculty & advisors as requirements change. Design marketing materials to include under-represented students. Students should be able to relate and respond to materials. May also be helpful to include these on CA+P website. Create more opportunities for these students to become engaged. The Architecture LEAP course is a great start. Identify more ways that \"learning communities\" can provide support for students. Update Information Bookmarks to include admissions, average salaries, job outlook, and \"Who hires U of U graduates\" information. Create tracking system to regularly contact prospective students regarding deadlines NETWORKING Participate in at least 3 High School Conferences each semester at select venues regionally targeting Salt Lake, Granite, Canyons, Davis, Jordan, and Alpine School Districts. Project Youth/Design Your Future are outreach events held during finals to showcase CA+P student projects and engage students in hands-on activities. Participate in at least 3 Recruitment Fairs at select venues on campus and regionally (out of state fairs are expensive and not feasible, at this juncture). Create Social Media pages and profiles to allow students living far away or cannot afford to visit the campus to see what everyday student life is in CA+P. (CMP is the only dept. on FB, Twitter, etc.) Exhibit College Materials at least 3 times each semester at regional multi-cultural and women's workshops and conferences. Graduate School - Diversity Office offers programs to support underrepresented students: University Visit Program (UVP), Excellence Through Diversity Fellowship (ETDF), and Graduate Preparation Institute (GPI). Be sure that students know and utilize these resources. Purchase Ad Space in print and electronic media outlets potential graduate students and their advisors might read. These include Planning magazine, Planetizen, ITE Journal, Focus on Geography (AGS). Use Faculty to promote the programs when they speak at conferences, etc. OUTREACH Connect with high school counselors to inform students of program and pre-requisites. Discover Architecture engages high school juniors and seniors in the design process and introduces students to the Update transfer guides which outline courses codes transfer. Collaborate with the Admissions office in setting up Articulation Agreements between schools (Urban Ecology/MDD). Make data more readily available about financial support during their degree program and job placement after graduation. Collaborate with the CESA Office to present program information and resources. Co-attend regional conferences targeting under-represented populations. Promote the Emerging Diversity Scholars Fellowship designed to offer financial support to underrepresented graduate students who have completed their first-year of full-time graduate studies. Encourage Faculty to Write Articles for broad-based, non-research magazines for planning and allied professions (e.g., Planning, ITE Journal, Focus). The articles should be on a wide variety of topics. Use Alums to distribute information about our program through their various networks. ENGAGEMENT SAT/ACT Testing students who list an interest in architecture or planning and the University of Utah should be contacted and provided with a program information packet. Class visits are ways to connect more closely with students. Seek opportunities to visit classrooms and engage students in hands-on activities early on. University Publications should highlight student and faculty articles, projects, and books as often as possible. Help Student Organizations publicize events, conferences, and meetings to encourage more participation. GRE/GMAT Testing students with interest in the University & architecture or planning should be contacted. This info is free through the Grad School for diverse students. 6 ADMISSIONS Once we have sold a potential student on Utah, we need for them to (1) complete an application and (2) commit to matriculate at the U . For undergraduates in the Architecture or Design major, departmental advisors facilitate the admissions process each spring semester (no application is needed for Urban Ecology students). Admissions for graduate students are managed year round by the Recruitment and Admissions officer (MCMP ), Department Advisor ( M.ARCH ), and Program Advisor ( PhD). For the admissions process to be effective in bringing in high caliber students, expectations need to be clear and information readily available. APPLICATION PROCESS Each undergraduate major program makes its application available on the CA+P website. Supplemental materials like the digital portfolio, essay of motivation, LOR, and resume are either uploaded, mailed in, or emailed to departmental advisors. CA+P may want t o explore ways to centralize the applicat ion and prohibit students from submitting applications until all materials are received . The application process for graduate students has been streamlined and vastly improved by the introduction of the ApplyYourself online application system . Periodic r eview and tweaking as necessary should keep the system both effective and efficient for prospective students and faculty/staff. It will be helpful for students to include on the website and printed materials specific information about average GPA, GRE, and TOEFL scores of recently admitted students . Portfolio samples may be helpful as well. Rolling admissions deadlines are helpful to accommodate flexibility for students, but make record management difficult and time consuming . CA+P may need to re -think thi s strategy moving forward. MATRICULATION Currently, after we make an offer of admission, we have no further contact with the admitted student (unless he/she has been offered financial aid). Basically, we wait to see if the admitted students show up on the first day of classes. This passive approach shows that we are indifferent to whether a particular student actually comes to the U. That indifference could turn off applicants, especially those who have offers from other schools . It also leaves the depa rtment in the dark about the size of the incoming cohort. To remedy this, we should : Engage in Active Follow -Up with admitted applicants to encourage them to come to the U. To do this we should: i Distribute the information packets, described above, to th e admittees; i Have faculty members make individual, personal contacts with admittees; i Invite admittees to visit the campus (in groups on a scheduled day or individually) ; i Schedule an \"admitted students day\" that would include meetings with faculty, sitting in on a class, tours of campus and town, and info rmation sessions on curriculum, financial issues , housing, and job/internship opportunities. Figure 9: ANNUAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS ADMITTED TO CA+P BS in Architectural Studies BS in Mult -Disciplinary Design M.ARCH (2 Year) M.ARCH (3+ Year) MCMP PhD in Metro Planning, Policy, & Design 50 20 30 15 25 3 These figures are approximate and fluctuate each year depending on space and competitiveness of applicant pool. 7 Set a Deadline for Admitted Students to accept or decline our admissions offer. The should optimize for giving us information about incoming cohort size and sending a message to admitted students that we are serious about their attendance, while not unduly excluding students that may make attendance decisions late. ORIENTATION Freshmen and Transfer New Student Orientation is coordinated through the University Orientation office. An orientation leader is assigned to each college who completes a semester long training class and represents the college at all orientation sessions . Mainly during the summer, CA+P staf f will collaborate with the orientation leader on effective ways to promote CA+P programs and orient new students on the required courses and resources available. Since orientation is a 2 -day program, t he Recruitment & Admissions Officer will give presenta tions in the Major Exploration sessions on day 1 and the Academic Advisor will facilitate the building tour and advising session on day 2 . When admitted graduate student s have indicated a commitment to attend the U, we need to provide them with informatio n on how they can make the transition to Salt Lake City, the U, and the M.ARCH/ MCMP /PhD program. This can be done by updating the graduate student handbook or through a more formal orientation held during the first week of classes or available online. The different topics that fall under this heading can be grouped into the following categories: x Living : Housing, culture, employment, social and outdoor activities , banking/credit union ; x The U : Important offices/contacts, parking/transit, how to register for classes, financial aid restrictions/responsibilities, where to get food on campus, non -cA+P academic opportunities ; x CA+P: Faculty bios, department/college activities and schedules, guidance on where to find information/who to ask, where the coffee cart is , student organizations; x Specific Program : The curriculum, recommended progression/schedule of courses, cA+P field areas, research opportunities , advising, reporting/record keeping responsibilities, schedule of program milestones . ADVISING Students are re quired to participate in advising at key points in their academic experience. College advising consists of advising on the program at -a-glance, the major declaration process, class selection and course sequencing, graduation planning, and career advising. Programs At -A-Glance (Recruitment & Admissions Officer) All prospective students receive information regarding their program of interest. This includes the application process, faculty expectations, and campus life. It is also important at this stage to communicate what students can expect while in the program especially concerning time commitments, IT recommendations, etc. Major Declaration Pre-Major (College Academic Advisor) Until required courses are completed, students are listed as Pre -Archiecture, Pre-Urban Ecology, or Pre - Design. Through the University Mandatory Advising Program (MAP) students are expected to see an advisor prior or during their first semester of enrollment, and again in their second year (at least 2 semesters). A hold is placed o n registration until these requirements are met. Major 1 -2, Grad 1 -2 (Department Advisors) Once admitted into their program of interest, each department advisor can access student records and update majors. Email addresses are then updated for each cohort to facilitate easier communication. Class Selection & Course Sequencing (College Academic Advisor/Dept Advisors) A good deal of advising is focused on helping students navigate their way through the basic mechanical requirements of the curriculum (e.g., W hat are the core courses? How many electives do I need? What are 8 the recommended electives?) . Advisors utilize the PeopleSoft and DARS programs to assist students with these basic advising functions. Through PeopleSoft, advisors have the ability to view s tudent information, including test scores, grades, and advisor notes. The Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS) or Masters Audit Reporting System (MARS) is an internet -based tool designed to see a progression toward a particular degree program. Advising on more complicated curricular subjects (e.g., Can I substitute a Geography Dept course for a core requirement? How can my summer in the Argentina program count toward my degree? How can I integrate another degree or a grad certificate into my program?) n eeds to be provided by a faculty member or the department chair. It is preferable that one person be designated to provide this type of advising to ensure accurate, complete, and consistent information to students. Graduation Planning (Dept Advisors/Ch airs) The Graduation Planning System (GPS) is a companion to DARS/MARS that allows students and advisors to create 4, 5, and 6 year graduation roadmaps, as well as customized plans for sequencing courses into a graduation timeline. Very soon, GPS will have the functionality for students to enroll in courses directly from their graduation plan. Before graduating a ll students need to complete a professional project that is executed with faculty direction and guidance. Because the basics of how to conceptual ize and structure professional projects are essentially the same for all projects, this type of advising could be done in a group/seminar setting with a single faculty member. After that point, students should be assigned to individual faculty members for more in -depth advising on the specifics of their projects. Ideally, there would be subject matter alignment between student project subjects and a faculty member's expertise. Regardless of subject matter alignment, however, advising assignment loads per faculty member need to be equitable. Career Advising (Program Director/Dept Chairs) Most students need some advising for how to manage the transition from school to career. In addition to the placement resources, outlined below, students should rece ive some level of career advising from department faculty. The faculty members assigned for advising on professional projects should also provide this type of career advice. RETENTION Retention and graduation rates are important indicators of the student body's overall interest in the university and whether students thrive on a particular campus , or not. This figure can explain many factors that compose the attractiveness of a university , including the quality of its teaching staff, the relevance of the curriculum, and the perceived value of what is being taught. Data published in 2012 (shown in figure 10 below ), indicates a need for improvement in retaining students , as well as providing support through to gradu ation.

It will be an ongoin g process for this committee to identify the barriers students face and propose systems that if created will enhance the student experience and improve retention/graduatio n rates. Figure 1 1: CA+P ADVISING COMMITT EE MEMBERS RECORD KEEPING Documenting and recording a student's progression through the program, from admissions to graduation, is essential. Current systems seem to be covering all the most important events . Still , staff and faculty should be attentive to ways in which we might improve our systems. T he recent addition of an approval form for independent stud ies and profession al projects is a good example. PLACEMENT Having professionally -based program s, it is important that CA+P develop and maintain systems that will assist students in findin g employment after graduation. Placement information is important for many reasons, including recruitment of new students, accreditation, and institutional development. We are beginning to collaborate with the University Career Services Office to track placement data and build stronger relationships with employers. All students can access resources available thro ugh Career Services for up to a year following graduation , after which they join the Alumni Association . betham@arch.utah.edu 801-585-2361 ARCH 235 Advises all prospective Students.

Whether it is a required core course or hours towards licensure , a broad range of opportunities should be made available for students. Although CA+P hosts a Firm Fair every spring for industry employers to network with students , job opportunities may become available at other times du ring the year and there is no central location for such opportunities to circulate. Currently, the department s forward job opportunities to specific students in each progra m. It is suggested that the departme nts also forward this information to the Career Counselor assigned to CA+P. Internship and job opportunities may then be posted to the online database, UCareer Link updated by the Career Services Office throughout the year. When a student become s interested in an internship or job, and contacts the Career Counselor , they can receive feedback on their cover letter and resume , run through a mock interview , and be guided through the process of receiving an offer, negotiating a salary , and making a decision. Not only will this system centralize these opportun ities but also allow CA+P to better track placement data. Employers from the Firm Fair are also offered the opportunity to volunteer as a contact for the \"Ask-a-Professional \" function where students and prof essionals can network all year round. More information may be found here: http://careers.utah.edu/students/research/major/architecture - studies.php#outlook JOB OUTLOOK It will be important for prospecti ve students to know what future opportunities to expect a s well as projected industry trends. Figure 1 2: AVERAGE ANNUAL SALARIES8 ARCHITECTS URBAN & REGIONAL PLANNERS COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGNERS National Utah U of U Graduates (Entry Level) National Utah U of U Graduates (Entry Level) National Utah U of U Graduates (Entry architects is projected to grow 17 percent from 2012 to 2022, faster than the average for all occ upations. Architects will be needed to make plans and designs for the construction and renovation of homes, offices, retail stores, and other structures. As campus buildings age, many school districts and universities are expected to build new facilities or renovate existing ones. Demand is expected for more healthcare facilities as the baby -boomer population ages and as more individuals use healthcare services. Demand is projected for architects with knowledge of green design, also called sustainable desig n. Sustainable design emphasizes the efficient use of resources, such as energy and water conservation; waste and pollution reduction; and environmentally friendly design, specifications, and materials. Rising energy costs and increased concern about the e nvironment have led to many new buildings being built with more sustainable designs. Employment of urban and regional planners is proj ected to grow 10 percent from 2012 to 2022, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Population growth and environmental concerns will drive employment growth for planners in cities, suburbs, and other areas. Planners will continue to be needed to make changes to plans, programs, or regulations to reflect demographic changes throughout the nation. Within cities, urban planners will be needed to develop revitalization projects and address problems 11 associated with population growth, population diversi ty, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity. Similarly, suburban areas and municipalities will need planners to address the challenges associated with population changes, including housing needs and transportation systems. Although government funding issues will affect employment of planners in the short term, job prospect s should improve over the coming decade. Planners will be needed to help plan, oversee, and carry out development projects that were deferred because of poor economic conditions. Combined with the increasing demands of a growing population, long -term prosp ects for qualified planners should be good. Employment of industrial designers is projected to grow 4 percent from 2012 to 2022, slower than the average for all occupations. Consumer demand for new products and new product styles should sustain the demand for industrial designers. Employment in the manufacturing industry is projected to experience a slight decline over the projection period contributing to the slower than the average growth for industrial designers. Prospects are best for job applicants with a strong background in two - and three -dimensional computer - aided design (CAD) and computer -aided industrial design (CAID). The in creasing trend toward the use of sustainable resources is likely to improve prospects for applicants with the knowledge to work with sustainable resources.

Appendix J Curriculum Re/magination Process \u0018ocuent APPENDIX J INDEX J.1 J.2 V ALUE RUBRIC DRAFTS J.1 CURRICULUM PROCESS D OCUMENTATION SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE CURRICULUM RE -IMAGINATION PROCESS Our faculty has invested a tremendous amount of time and energy into the design of a new curriculum . The process began in spring 2015 with a series of surveys of faculty, students, a nd our professional community. T he goal of these surveys was to determine what kind of graduates we wanted to produce , and how our graduates could serve both the discipline of architecture and the communitie s in which we work. The result of this work was a set of values and a set of skills/knowledges that every student should understand in order to gr aduate . This included the ability to think and act critically, to research and develop design processes indepe ndently, and to write and communicate effectively to different audiences all with a broad foundation of knowledge of the history and theory of architecture and of the social and cultural movements that gave life to architecture and theory. Curricular goals include: Train students to be critical thinkers and leaders in the field. Focus on the processes of design, research, and thinking : creative thinking, critical thinking, problem solving, exploration and risk -taking. Build toward integration over the cour se of the curriculum, providing appropriate integration at different stages in student development and opportunities for students and faculty to make meaningful connections between different areas of instruction : design, history/theory/criticism, technolog y, communications, professional practice. Develop transparency throughout the curriculum: clear and transparent understanding of how area objectives (core knowledge and skills) build from one semester to the next as well as how courses within a particular semester relate to each other either through integration or sequencing. Break up the dominance of the studio in the curriculum and subsequent marginalization of other courses. Emphasize liberal arts based education at undergraduate level and more specializ ed focus on architecture in graduate program. Move NAAB Student Performance Criteria out of undergraduate program to graduate program where possible. Another important goal was to integrate our ethical framework and value system into the curriculum in an explicit and transparent way. This included the values of the College ( \"4 Rs\") and the School . We developed a list of specific values based on our curricular discussions and organized them into overlapping categories of disciplinary values, pedagog ical values, and ethical values. Values Diagram List of Values Disciplinary Values Environmental Resilience Leadership/Collaboration Design Excellence Community Engagement Pedagogical Values Community Engagement Critical Creative Thinking Risk-Taking/Exploration Global Citizenship Ethical Values Global Citizenship Social Equity Agency Environmental Resilience After determining what type of graduate we wanted to produce, we began a process of developing both course and degree objectives , which we then map ped across the four years of the u ndergraduate program and the two -to-three years of our graduate program . The process began with faculty in each subject area working together to develop a comprehensive list of objectives appropriate to that subject at each level of the curriculum. Then we began to map these objectives witho ut regard for courses or areas in order to break down the divisions of the different areas of study . This process allowed us to rethink the curriculum in broad terms with a clear focus on the goals of producing architects who could engage the critical issues of the discipline in effective ways. Once we map ped objectives very broadly , we began to group them in logical ways to allow us to develop new and innovative courses. In both small groups and as a full faculty, we mapped our o bjectives at more and more detailed levels, from curriculum wide mapping to mapping into particula r course integrations and project descriptions. From that process we were able to develop short narrative semester descriptions of each level of the program. The core of our graduate program is the two-year M.Arch program . The semester narratives are below. The first year of the two -year graduate program is known as \"Grad 1\" (or G1), and the second year is \"Grad 2\" (or G2). The new M.Arch program is designed to create opportunities for students and faculty to make meaningful connections between the diff erent areas of instruction - design , history/theory/criticism, building technology, communications, and professional practice. The two -year curriculum, described below, is structured for students who already have an undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree in architectural studies. For students with other undergraduate degrees, the 3+ M.Arch is the appropriate program. The curriculum is composed of four distinct experiences in the two years of study: research and design methods integration, professional in tegration, an immersive experience, a nd a final self -authored studio , which provides students with the opportunity to take control of their education and choose an area of expertise to develop. Within each experience, distinct areas of study are integrated to develop the skills, knowledges, and critical creative thinking necessary for the et hical practice of architecture. Curriculum Map G1 Fall: Design Methods Integration The M. ARCH Begins with an integrated experience that provides a foundation for the design proc ess. The sequence begins with integration between studio, communications, and history/theory/criticism ( HTC) research methods. In the first half of the semester, HTC feeds the studio process as primer for design, and communications defin ing a controlled path for tool sequence through the design process including critical evaluation of both tools and process. G1 Spring: Professional Integration This semester is focused in integrati ng the conceptual design and professional design development processes that allow for the consultation with allied trades including engi neers, codes, contractors, etc. Studio and building systems application courses are given equal weight and coordinated throughout the semester. G2 Summer/Fall: Immersive Experience A hallmark of our M.Arch program, the immersive experience is designed to fully engage students in an aspect of architectural practice. For example, DesignBuildBLUFF (http://www.designbuildbluff.org/ ), loca ted in Utah's Four Corners region, provides students the opportunity to design a nd build a full -scale project in partnership with the Navajo Nation. Design -Build Salt Lake focuses on the design and construction of highly energy efficient affordable houses for underserved communities in Salt Lake, and the Urban Design Studio is a community engaged design studio that tackles pressing civic issues at the urban scale. G2 Spring: Final Self -Authored Studio Following the integrated curriculum in the previous years, students are mentored through a self -authored project in which they must show the ability to integrate the many different aspects of architecture to develop and research a self -authored studio project. Students are guided through this process via a final HTC methods course that focuses on research and preparation for the final project accompanied by a University elective that focuses on the topic of the studen t's individual final project. In addition, we offer a 3+ program for students with an undergraduate degree in some field other that architecture. This program consists of one year of intensive study followed by a full integration into the two-year M.Arch program. The new curriculum development continue s this yea r with the development and roll -out of the new integrated courses and methods of assessment . Attendant to this roll-out is the continued mapping of learning objectives; our disciplinary, pedagogic al, and ethical values; and student performance criter ia required by our NAAB Accredit ation into courses , as well as the clear articulation of p rogram learning objectives, and the develop ment of methods for outcomes assessment specific to the new curriculu m. M.Arch Learning Objectives (Current Draft): Outcome 1. Theory, Concepts, and Critique (Knowledge) Students who complete a degree in architecture will have knowledge of the field including history, theories, concepts, and approaches . Students will: 1.1 Develop a thorough and critical understanding of various theoretic positions in architecture and its related fields (art, history, philosophy, technology) . 1.2 Develop of a critical understanding of architectural history and theory against the context of culture and society at large, including pressing issues such as social equity, global citizenship, ec ological resilience, and agency, and position themselves as architects with regard to both the profession and civic society, and politics and ethics . 1.3 Analyz e, compare , and construct theoretical positions in architecture in written and oral discursive formats . 1.4 Develop a deep engagement with theory as a primer for design including how to build an argument, construct a question, propose a research a genda, and conduct formal research and analysis to solve architectural design problems of various scales and complexities . Outcome 2. Professional Practice, Communication, and Critical Thinking (Skills) Students who graduate with a degree in architecture will have an understanding of where the profession is headed and what the ch allenges for the profession are and of different forms of practice , and will have the ability to question modes of practice and project delivery. Students will: 2.1 Demonstrate the ability to execute an architectural project through all of its phases from research to design, including the development and critique of a design process and the proposal of a viable and buildable design or rigorous open exploration driven by more theoreti cal considerations . 2.2 Ccommunicate effectively in written and oral and visual formats in a manner appropriate to their audience and develop a high level of architectural communication, understanding the latest advancements in digital design and its integrate d fabrication. 2.3 Develop leadership and collaboration skills to facilitate and coordinate client, engineers, codes, contractor, etc. as well as navigate interest of groups that are invisible to the profession. 2.4 Develop various methods for the professional rep resentation of their work, be equipped to defend it, and understand and respond to feedback in productive ways . 2.5 Develop information and visual literacy: critically assess and evaluate the validity, reliability, and appropriateness of precedents and sources . Outcome 3. Social Responsibility in a Diverse World (Values) As an academic field of study, architecture emerged from a long history of formal and informal methods and economies. Students will learn to value the activist potential of the field, to think and act at various scales, and to be cognizant of their positionality in relationship to others. Students will: 3.1 Use knowledge of the historic and contemporary role and differential effects of architecture on local and global systems to develop or advocate for informed action to solve complex problems in society. 3.2 Understand how to generate and interpret complex community based information to inform their building designs. They will be able to analyze diverse communities and cultural phenomena and interpret the same in architectural terms. 3.3 See themselves as part of a global community that is interdependent and intertwined by: i) Meaningfully engaging with others in class and in the larger community; ii) Identifying their own cultural patterns and putting them int o comparison with cultural patterns different from their own; and iii) Adapting design methods and communication skills imaginatively and flexibly to unfamiliar ways of being, thinking, seeing, and acting. In 2017 -8, w e developed an extensive assessment proc ess to ensure that the values and objectives are imbedded in new courses in a transparent way. This included faculty development workshops focused on the principals of transparent teaching, developing appropriate objectives, rubric development, and feminis t teaching methods and innovative pedagogies. Following these workshops , faculty participated in syllabus and rubric writing workshops . Faculty were asked to come to the workshops with drafts of th eir syllabi and rubrics and then were grouped based on subj ect area and integrated teaching. These small groups were guided by the Chair and Associate Chair in discussing the strengths and weaknesses of syllabi, the clarity of learning objectives, the connection between objectives and the assignments designed to a chieve them, and the development of appropriate rubrics to ensure that the objectives were evaluated in grading. These meetings not only provided structure for the development of our new integrated courses, but also allowed the faculty to work together to assess the intended outcomes for the new courses. This assessment method will continue in a more abbreviated form once the new cu rriculum is fully in place . In addition, at the end of each semester , the faculty will come together to assess the outcome s of the new courses at our end-of-semester retreat (see section 5.1: Learning outcomes assessment procedures) . To better understand ways in which the SoA values can be embedded within course assignments and assessed in a str aightforw ard manner, we have begun to develop rubrics for each of the nine values. These rubr ics are based on the Association of A merican Colleges & Universities ( AAC&U ) VALUE (Valid Assessment Learning in Undergraduate Education ) rubrics (https://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics ). Drafts of five of the SoA value rubrics are attached in the following section of this appendix.

The program has two tracks -digital products and physical product s. This interdisciplina ry program train s students to compete in an increasin gly complex work environment through a thoroug h understanding of ethical conduct and social responsibility based on these specific concepts: inquiry and project -based learning critical thinking skills experimentation with multiple ways of problem solving visual literacy innovation and invent ion team building and collaboration identifying authentic real -world tasks and challenges design research human centered design principles The multi-disciplinary Bachelor of Science in Design degree program encompasses a curriculum with four substantive a reas applicable to all design education: studio, technical, history/ theory and practice. In addition to the classes and faculty from the Design program, the curriculum has been developed with existing University of Utah faculty and courses from Architecture, Fine Arts, Communication, Business, Bio -Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Psychology. This program has at its core the shared fundamental understanding of the language, process and application of design and design thi nking. This proposes to use design as a verb for activities rooted in four cornerstones: Engagement, Community, Collaboration and Responsibility. This broad perspective allows for students to see the connections between these design specialties and focus on the process of design as a creative idea and development framework. It expands students' horizons by engaging with other design disciplines in strategic and collaborative ways. This approach can lead to exciting new design engagement that can deeply enga ge the world as it is and as it is becoming. K.

Follow-up Report - Abbreviated Template Section I: The Request University of Utah submits a Three-year Follow-up Report for the following Baccalaureate degree: Multi- Disciplinary Design. This program was originally approved by the Board of Regents on 08/20/2013 and the first students were able to declare or be admitted to the program in Fall 2013. Section II: Program Report Program Description Present a brief program description. Indicate why the program was initiated. State how the institution and the USHE have benefited by offering the program. Description : The Multi-Disciplinary Design program uses product design as a vehicle to investigate design research, human centered design principles, interface developme nt, articulation of product forms, materials and digital manufacturing principles. After successfully completing 20 credit hours in specified pre-major courses, students accepted into the major will focus on one of two track s: one that is more related to form giving closely related to Industrial Design and the other that is more digital ly related. In the modern world the boundaries that exist between applied d esign disciplines often aren't as easily defined. The adherence to siloed solutions is breaking down. Bridges are bei ng built between specialties in order to cultivate a shared understanding, synergistic collaboration and a common vo cabulary - all of which are essential to solving complex problems. Those versed in the language of design and cr itical thinking will be essential voices in such dialogues. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that we not onl y educate our future designers with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of design and design thinking, but to begin cu ltivating collaborative environments that reflect contemporary paradigms. Why: This idea of cross-fertilization is not new. It has, perhaps, just been inadvertently forgotten due to the complexities of the university structure. The Bauhaus which ope rated in Germany from 1919-1933 (and subsequent new Bauhaus at the Illinois Institute of Technology) was/is a m odel of inter-disciplinary study that purposefully ignored arbitrary and artificial boundaries and provided a comm on approach to design and art-making across divergent disciplines. This union of art, craft and technology led to innovations in architecture, graphic design, product design, furniture design and materials that continue to reverberate. In the last number of years many private institutions and desig n practices have taken up this theme through the linkage between different disciplines through the common langua ge of design. The d.school at Stanford, the New School at Parsons, IIT Institute of Design and MIT Media labs a re modern equivalents of the Bauhaus that bring together a diverse set of specialties across the common framewo rk of design and using community based complex problems at their core. Benefits : The University of Utah and USHE have benefitted from the MDD program in three major ways. First our program focus is providing much needed skill sets and leadershi p abilities in the growing physical/digital product design professions in Salt Lake City and Utah. Second, our prog ram currently has a graduation rate higher than 90% from the point of major declaration and acceptance. Third, our open enrollment courses have reached close to 30 majors across the campus continuing our mission to engage th e university as a whole. Enrollment and Revenue Data See Appendix A: Program Participation and Finance Institutional Analysis of Program to Date Provide a statement that summarizes the institution's current analysis of the program's strengths and weaknesses relative to enrollments, staffing, and funding. Describe any actions the institution has taken or will take to respond to any issues with t he program. Strengths: Currently the MDD program runs lean with it's full-time facult y to student ratio. As described in the program description the MDD program has curated a collective of highly educated and accomplished professionals to engage the program as adjunct faculty. While this is an inc redibly difficult task given limited resources staffing and facilities, we have used these constraints as opportunities to r e-describe the student and classroom/studio experience. Weaknesses: Relative to enrollments, staffing and funding the underlying w eakness for the MDD program lies within our ability to meet increasing interest and demand. We are seeing a doubled interest from potential students on one end and more than doubled from employers at the other en d. This year alone we have experienced a surge in interest in our program which is sustaining for the upcoming 2017-18 academic year. The growth problem faces us in two ways, the opportunity to accept more students combine d with the expansion of the program from two to four years as an experience allowing our student numbers (major declarations) to grow internally. Actions: Internally the College of Architecture + Planning is working w ith the MDD program to provide added accommodations in the Field house and new investments in digita l fabrication resources shared by the college as whole. We are currently seeking growth funding to head off the anticipated enrollment increase both in-major and with our courses that serve the university as a whole. MDD is h oping the university will help meet this demand with faculty and part-time staff lines. Employment Information Provide employment information on graduates of the program. In May of 2016 the MDD program graduated it's second cohort. As a small and relatively new program we've been able to track our recent graduates and their transitions into t he job market and graduate school environments. Currently we estimate* that 100% of our students not in graduat e school are employed either within degree aligned companies or sustaining living wages as free-lance design consu ltants. Two of our students are currently enrolled in graduate school. From what we understand in conversation with students and their employers, they are well received and valued as team members and entrepreneurial thinker s.Appendix A: Program Participation and Finance In the following table,record the number of students who are enrolled in the program as well as expenses to the institution and revenues generated.Use department or unit numbers as reported in the approved R401 proposal for \"Year Preceding Implementation.\" Three Year Projection /Program Participation and Department Budget New Program Year Preceding ImplementationYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Student Data # of Majors in Department # of Majors in Proposed Program(s) # of Graduates from Department # Graduates in New Program(s) REVENUE - source of funding to cover additional costs generated by proposed program(s) Department Budget Year Preceding ImplementationYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Internal Reallocation Appropriation Special Legislative Appropriation Grants and Contracts Special Fees Tuition Differential Tuition (requires Regents approval) In the following table,record the number of students who are enrolled in the program as well as expenses to the institution and revenues generated.Use department or unit numbers as reported in the approved R401 proposal for \"Year Preceding Implementation.\" Three Year Projection /Program Participation and Department Budget New Program Year Preceding ImplementationYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Student Data # of Majors in Department 334 302 320 336 # of Majors in Proposed Program(s) 15 15 30 27 60 33 70 33 90 # of Graduates from Department 75 81 74 # Graduates in New Program(s) 0 0 15 5 30 10 40 50 REVENUE - source of funding to cover additional costs generated by proposed program(s) Department Budget Year Preceding ImplementationYear 1 Year 2 Year 3 Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Estimated Actual Internal Reallocation L INDEX L.1 CURRICULAR MANAGEMENT PLAN l.2 CURRICULAR ASSESSMENT CHART SoA CURRICULAR MANAGEMENT PLAN The SoA's process for assessment and adjustment of the curriculum, which is led by the SoA Curriculum Committee and the SoA Chair, involves four specific parts: 1) data collect ion and evaluation (see section on Departmental Program Assessment below) , 2) faculty -level discus sion and review of the data, 3) Curriculum Committee study and solution iden tification of f aculty -suggested issues, and 4) faculty review of and voting on proposed solutions. A chart identifying all parties involved in curricular assessment and their roles and responsibilities is shown below. The SoA Curriculum Committee is led b y a tenured faculty member and consists of faculty representing all areas of the curriculum including Curriculum Area Coordinators (organized by topic areas - studio, communications, history/theory/criticism, technology/structures, and professional practice ), undergraduate and graduate students, the SoA Chair or Associate Chair, and at least one member of the local professional communi ty (typically an adjunct faculty member ). The Curriculum Committee completes in -depth study of the issues brought forth by the SoA Chair and faculty from the fall retreat , weighs various possible solutions, determines the most effective solutions (often in discussion with the entire SoA faculty at a monthly faculty meeting), and presents proposals to the faculty for discussion and vote at a regular faculty meeting. In the event of a major programmatic change, the School or Curriculum Committee Chair bring s the issue to a vote at a College Council meeting (which occur twice per semester) and, if necessary, later guides the issue through the proper university channels for discussion and a vote. These university channels required for approval may include the University Graduate Council, Academic Senate, Board of Trustees, and the Board of Regents . Learning outcomes (LOs) per course are prepared by individual faculty members , and reviewed by the SoA Chair as well as by faculty within the curriculum area (stu dio, communications, history/theory/criticism, technology/structures, and professional practice). Architecture program learning outcomes are developed by the SoA Chair and Assoc iate Chair based on the course and curricular area LOs and reviewed by the Leadership Team prior to being published. Learning outcomes were last reviewed in spring 2015 and are be ing reviewed and revised currently as part of our curriculum re -imagination process. Departmental Program Assessment The SoA evaluates the efficacy and outcomes of the M.Arch degree program utilizing several different forms of assessment: course evaluations completed by students; the SoA strategic plan, mission, and core beliefs; the university - and college -level evaluations (including the Graduate Council Review, CA+P Advisory Board feedback, alumni surveys, regular meetings between the SoA Chair and the CA+P Dean, as well as SoA and CA+P Leader ship Team meetings) ; the CA+P mission and SMART goals; and the 201 6 National Architectural Accrediting Board Visiting Team Report . These varied forms of assessment provide a comprehensive framework for continually clarifying the program's direction, evaluating the outcomes from various per spectives, and proposing revisions. Departmental assessment occurs at multiple levels. All -faculty reviews of SoA course content and student work take place at the end of each semester and are an important component of our assessment process. Faculty are able to see firsthand where strengths and weaknesses lie within the academic program and immediately identify and discuss potential solutions. An anonymous online survey of undergraduate and graduate students at the end of the academic year asks about learning and achievement opportunities related to SPCs and the SoA mission and core beliefs. All students graduating from the M.Arch program are i nterviewed individually by the Chair just prior to graduation, with the goal of understanding their perspectives of their academic and professional preparation. Individual faculty members also conduct exit interviews with students and bring relevant inform ation to faculty discussions. Periodic alumni surveys provide additional information regarding preparation for professional work and life within the architectural community. The students and their work are assessed with less formal methods as well. Outside jurors in studio reviews and guest lecturers in non -studio courses provide valuable feedback to both students and faculty. Feedback also is given by the professional community after visits to firms conducted in the professional practice c lasses and after the annual Career Fair, where students show their portfolios to represented firms. The AIAS (American Institute of Architects Students) mentoring program provides another opportunity for practitioners to get to know students and later share their ide as and advice with faculty and administration. Courses are assessed through anonymous online course evaluations (required as part of the University's accreditation). The University requires individual faculty members to prepare descrip tions of course lea rning outcomes, which serve as a basis for part of these evaluations. Results of the evaluations are given to instructors to assist in course revision and to the SoA Chair to provide an overview of the effectiveness of the teaching methods in conveying course content. Annually in the spring semester, the Chair reviews teaching evaluations and meets with each faculty member (including adjuncts) to discuss teaching issues and goals. The results of these varied annual assessment activities are collated and discussed in the SoA retreat at the sta rt of each fall semester. There, the faculty identify the issues that become the agenda for the SoA committees, where concrete suggestions for programmatic and curricular changes leading to improved outcomes are formulated and brought back to the faculty f or final approval.
