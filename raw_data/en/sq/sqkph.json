This ninth edition differs from previous editions in that we have linked each major learning objective to one of the six ACGME general competencies: Medical Knowledge (MK); Patient Care (PC); Professionalism (P); Interpersonal and Communication Skills (ICS); Practice Based Learning & Improvement (PBLI); and Systems Based Practice (SBP). We have done this to assist program directors as they use these Educational Objectives to construct the goals and objectives for each of the rotations within their individual programs. The overall goals of the text are to provide general guidelines on which an individual program's curriculum can be based and to make it easier for programs to establish realistic, practical learning objectives. In writing this edition of the Educational Objectives we strove to provide readers with a clear, concise description of exactly what knowledge and skills residents should master during their training regardless of the type of prac-tice they will be entering upon completion of their residency. This edition of the Educational Objectives retains the overall format of prior editions and includes summary Tables at the end of each unit delineating the procedures a resident should either understand or be able to perform independently at the time of graduation. In this edition of Educational Objectives we have included new learning ob- jectives related to patient safety and advocacy, sexuality, and genetics/genom-ics. These changes are based on the evolving role of physicians in society and new information the obstetrician-gynecologist will need to master in order to optimize their provision of health care for women. Members of the CREOG Education Committee developed Educational Objectives: Core Curriculum in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ninth Edition . The committee is composed of generalists and subspecialists with many years of experience in medical education. They were assisted by editorial consultants from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and CREOG, and the comments and critiques of colleagues in related organizations. The collective effort is a synthesis of learning objectives designed ultimately to prepare the graduating resident to be an independent practitioner of ob-stetrics and gynecology. Jessica L. Bienstock, MD, MPH Committee Chair viiviii EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVESGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 1The practice of obstetrics and gynecology requires a commitment to profes- sional as well as to personal growth. In addition to practicing technical skills, physicians should cultivate the ability to expand and apply those skills in a variety of settings. As such, knowledge of ethical principles, communication skills, and the ability to acquire and continually update information are im-portant components of professional development. The Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has identi ed six core competen-cies for incorporation into all resident training programs. These competen-cies, as they apply to the training of residents in obstetrics and gynecology, are summarized below in the form of performance-based learning objectives. I.

(SBP, P, ICS)PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE AMBULATORY HEALTH CARE 9Obstetrician-gynecologists provide primary health care services to their patients both within and outside the traditional purview of reproductive med-icine. As primary care physicians, obstetrician-gynecologists establish rela-tionships with their patients that transcend the disease spectrum and extend to routine assessments, preventive care, early intervention, and management of medical disorders. Periodic assessments provide an excellent opportunity to counsel patients about preventive care. These assessments should include screening, evaluation, and counseling based on age and risk factors. As the major providers of reproductive health care for women, obstetrician-gynecol-ogists are responsible for all aspects of care of reproductive disorders. Both the role of primary care physician and the role of reproductive health care provider require specialized skills and training and should be recognized as essential components in the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Even when certain disorders extend beyond the scope of their practice and require refer-ral, obstetrician-gynecologists serve in a consultant capacity in which they are involved in the continuing health maintenance of their patients. I. Periodic Health Assessments A. Perform initial assessment To gain the patient's con dence and cooperation in obtaining the history and performing the physical examination, the resident should appreciate the effects of age; racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds; sexual orientation; personality; mental status; and the patient's level of comfort and modesty. (PBLI, P) 1. Obtain a complete medical history, including a history of genetic diseases. (PC, ICS, P) 2. Perform an appropriate general or focused physical examination. (PC, P)UNIT 2 Primary and Preventive Ambulatory Health Care10 EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES B. Perform routine screening for selected diseases The content and frequency of routine health examinations for screening and counseling should be tailored to risk factors (see Table) and the patient's age (see Periodic Assessment). Major causes of morbidity and mortality by age can direct attention to areas that warrant special care. (PC, MK, P) 1. Ages 12 years and younger For the preadolescent patient, the obstetrician-gynecologist usually serves as a consultant. All primary care can be per-formed by a pediatrician or family physician after assessment of the speci c problem for which the patient was referred. (PC) Speci c objectives for the obstetrician-gynecologist in this pa-tient population are found in Unit 5 under Pediatric gynecology (birth to menarche). 2. Ages 13-18 years For adolescents, the obstetrician-gynecologist serves either as a consultant or as a primary health care provider, depending on the nature of his or her practice and level of expertise in the spectrum of reproductive tract disorders.

They must be able to recognize those factors in the history and physical examina-tion that indicate possible medical or obstetric complications. They must understand how to obtain and apply information from the history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies to evaluate the course of pregnancy. In evaluating patients for preconception care, obstetrician-gynecologists must assess those factors of the history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies that pregnancy would alter; assess the patient's access to, and com-pliance with, a plan of prenatal care; and consult with, or refer her to, other experts on speci c conditions that may arise during the pregnancy. In the clinical management of a normal term pregnancy, an understanding of the labor and delivery process is mandatory. Obstetrician-gynecologists must be able to determine the correct timing of delivery and to perform spontane-ous vaginal, operative vaginal, as well as abdominal deliveries. The principles and practice of immediate newborn resuscitation remain an important function for the obstetrician and should be taught at the appropriate post-graduate level in conjunction with the obstetrics component of the residency curriculum. Although the obstetrics resident is trained to address a variety of normal and complicated obstetric conditions, the resident should recognize that addition-al expertise may be required in certain patients and should refer to subspe-cialty-trained physicians as appropriate. The obstetrician-gynecologist must be familiar with the principles of ob- stetric anesthesia, including conduction anesthesia, general anesthesia, and local anesthesia techniques. Although the performance of these procedures is usually the responsibility of attendants trained in anesthesia, the obstetri-cian must be aware of the indications and contraindications for different anesthetic techniques and must be capable of managing anesthetic-related complications such as hypotension, seizures, and respiratory arrest.UNIT 3 Obstetrics30 EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES I.

Once primarily a surgical specialty, as a result of advances in therapeutic and diagnostic techniques, gy-necology has increasingly become more of ce-based. In addition to primary of ce care, the gynecologist often cares for patients with more specialized needs, including those of patients with endocrinologic disorders, infertil-ity and pregnancy loss, urologic disorders, cancer of the reproductive tract, and conditions requiring acute and critical care. In acquiring skills and knowledge in the general discipline of obstetrics and gynecology, residents should assimilate diagnostic and therapeutic principles underlying a broader spectrum of medical and surgical disorders. Once in clinical practice, the gynecologist often remains the primary health care provider for patients who have been treated by subspecialists or by physicians outside the specialty of obstetrics and gynecology.

The resident should either understand a procedure (includ-ing indications, contraindications, and principles) or be able to perform it independently. These distinctions are based on the premise that knowledge of a procedure is implicit in the ability to perform it.

Manifestations of disorders that become evident at the time of sexual maturation may have their beginnings as de-velopmental or genetic abnormalities. An understanding of the association between early developmental and genetic problems and their later manifesta-tions is important to appreciate the hormonal interactions that occur within the female reproductive tract. Likewise, the metabolic implications of disor-ders should be recognized. For many gynecologists, evaluating and treating fertility disorders constitute their entire practice. This area of the specialty includes identifying disorders related to pregnancy loss as well as causes of infertility. Although the resident in obstetrics and gynecology is not expected to master the actual techniques of assisted reproduction, knowledge of the scienti c basis for these proce-dures, including a thorough knowledge of gamete development, embryology, and physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, is imperative. The science underlying these techniques represents the cognitive information important to the application of these technologic skills. Women today spend more than one-third of their lifetimes in the postreproductive years. This area of medicine is becoming increasingly important as the life expectancy of U.S. women increases. The medical management of postreproductive women usually falls to the obstetrician-gynecologist specialist rather than the subspecialist. Therefore, the resident should have a thorough understanding of the changes that occur in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis at the time of menopause and the im-portance of these changes as they relate to alteration in other body systems, particularly the cardiovascular and skeletal systems. In addition, the resident should understand the appropriate use of hormone therapy.UNIT 5 Reproductive Endocrinology84 EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES I. Basic Science/Mechanisms of Disease A.

Although a select group of physicians devote their full practice to the care of patients with gynecologic malignan-cies, the resident in obstetrics and gynecology should become familiar with the therapeutic principles underlying the treatment of these patients and, more important, the identi cation of patients who are at risk for, or who may already have, malignancies of the pelvic organs or breast. Much of the improvement in the survival of women with gynecologic cancer can be attributed to more reliable screening techniques and an enhanced awareness of early symptoms on the part of both physicians and patients. Be-cause the distinction between a precursor lesion and its malignant counter-part is often subtle, knowledge of both premalignant and malignant lesions of the reproductive tract is necessary. The treatment\u2014whether surgical, radio-logic, or chemotherapeutic\u2014of a particular patient may or may not fall to the practicing general gynecologist, but he/she is expected to provide education, counseling, and follow-up for these patients. To do so, the resident physician must possess a basic understanding of the principles underlying radiation therapy, chemotherapy and terminal care . I. Basic Science/Mechanisms of Disease A.

The impact of these changes overarch the traditional divisions used in past editions of the CREOG Educational Objectives. I. Core Competencies The application of genomic information and technologies must be carried out under the general umbrella of the ACGME core competen-cies (see Unit I). Residents are expected to: A. Demonstrate caring and respectful behaviors when dealing with the genetic information of patients and their families. (P) B. Residents should identify areas in clinical genetics where there is signi cant potential for paternalism, discrimination, or injustice. (P) C. Discuss the role other (specialized) health care professionals play in the development of genetic information and testing that is used in the clinical setting. (SBP) II. Primary and Preventive Ambulatory Health Care The setting of primary health care services provides a number of op- portunities to apply the growing body of information available from genomics or genetically based technologies. From the assessment of breast cancer risk through the use of a directed family history and selected testing of speci cally associated gene variations, to the use of gene based technology to assess the risk of cervical cancer or to detect sexually transmitted disease, genomics has altered primary and preventive care.
