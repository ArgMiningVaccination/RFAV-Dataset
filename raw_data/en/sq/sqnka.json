Many types of rumours began to spread. But when our religious leaders and spiritual teachers came together and told people not to pay heed to rumours, the effect was immediate. India did not get to see vaccine hesitancy,\" Modi said. He said this while inaugurating the Amrita Hospital here. It is being constructed at an estimated cost of around Rs 6,000 crores in Faridabad in Haryana. Managed by Mata Amritanandamayi Math, the super-speciality hospital will be equipped with 2,600 beds. It will provide state-of-the-art healthcare facilities to the people of Faridabad and the entire NCR region. Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said the hospital was a blend of modernity and spirituality and will become a medium of accessible and affordable treatment for needy patients. \"Amma is the embodiment of love, compassion, service and sacrifice. She is the carrier of India's spiritual tradition,\" he said about Amma, popularly known as the hugging saint. \"India is a nation where treatment is a service, wellness is a charity. Where health and spirituality are related to each other. We have medical science as a Veda. We have also given the name of Ayurveda to our medical science,\" he said. The Prime Minister reminded the gathering that India never allowed its spiritual and service legacy to go into oblivion. The Prime Minister added that the system of discharging the responsibilities related to education and medicine by religious and social institutions was in a way the PPP model of old times.
