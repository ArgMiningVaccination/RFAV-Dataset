That sense perception is linked to the autonomic nervous systemand the function of the physiological systems enables us to examine the significance of autistic symptoms from asystemic perspective. Failure of the excretory system influences elimination of heavy metals and facilitates theiraccumulation and subsequent manifestation as neurotoxins: the long-term consequences of which would lead toneurodegeneration, cognitive and developmental problems. It may also influence regulation of neural hyperthermia.This article explores the issues and concludes that sensory dysfunction and systemic failure, manifested as autism, is theinevitable consequence arising from subtle DNA alteration and consequently from the overuse of vaccines.Keywords: autism, physiological systems, autonomic nervous systemIntroductionThat the occurrence of autism has risen steadily in the last decades is not in dispute. Prior to the 1930's and theintroduction of vaccinations autism was unknown. By 1968 in the UK, when Polio and DPT vaccines were given at 6and 7 months autism was very rare. In 1988, when Polio and DPT was given at 3 months, DPT at 5 months and MMR atc13 months autism rates were still low. In 1996, when Polio and DPT/HIB injections were given at 2, 3 and 4 months,followed by MMR at c13 months autism rates began rising rapidly. By 2006 the occurrence of autism had reachedpandemic proportions. In the period shortly before the 1980's the occurrence of autism was estimated to be circa 3-5 per10,000; the majority having autism from birth[1]. Since the introduction of multiple vaccines the prevalence of autismhas increased to an estimated 1 in 166 i.e. 60 per 10,000. Furthermore the trend is that of a continued increase. SomeBritish teachers are claiming to see ASD in one in every 86 children[2]. This is supported by research which suggeststhat one in 100 British children may have some form of autism[3] and that ASDs are more prevalent than hithertoimagined[4] i.e. only severe cases of autism are recorded in the statistics. Such claims have been dismissed as merespeculation on the basis that there is not yet definitive proof of such claims however the perceived lack of evidence doesnot indicate that proof does not exist[5,6]. It may indicate that the understanding of the condition remains 'beyond theprevailing level of knowledge' (Table 1) [7].By 1985 the incidence of regressive autism had equalled that from birth. By 1997 both types had increased although theregressive form was now >75% of the total occurrence. This suggests that an acquired condition was overtaking birthdefects or purely genetic conditions. Autism affects four boys to every girl[10]. By contrast Autism appears not to occurin communities which do not use vaccines[11]. It occurs in immigrants from tropical climates who appear to havegreater familial predisposition to autism[12] e.g. among Somali students in Minneapolis there was a rate of 1 in 28(which compares with the local average of 1 in 56). This is more than five times the national rate of 1 in 150. Since the1960's the number of vaccines given to a child before entering school has risen to c33. In children born to militaryfamilies the occurrence of autism may now be as low as 1 in 67. In the vast majority of cases, the emergence of autisticindications appears to happen in children who had developed normally[10,13,14], and before three years[15,16]. Thedevelopment of normal immune function appears to cease in the second year and is linked to the schedule ofvaccines[17] and/or the MMR vaccine[18,19]. The consequences to society are estimated at c\u00a32.4M in an autistic child'slifetime[20] which, if it continues to increase as many predict, will impose an unsustainable financial burden uponhealthcare, education and social welfare systems.The Systemic Nature of Physiology and FunctionThe body is a bio-dynamic, wholistic and systemic organism. It responds to sensory input which enables the autonomicnervous system thereby influencing behavior, the regulation of physiological systems, and function of the visceralorgans (Fig. 1). The established association between visual perception, the autonomic nervous system, physiologicalsystems, and biochemistry[21] raises issues which may be relevant to autism research.Different diseases are associated with differing colour perception[22] e.g. a yellow-blue deficit in diabetes[23],etcDifferent drugs are associated with altered color perception[24].Enzymes/Proteins are active in the visual spectrum[25,26].Suppressed immune function affects cognition[27]. In particular, t-cell deficiency (a common indicator of stress)is linked to cognitive dysfunction.Any form of biochemical variation must therefore influence sense perception, sensory coordination and cognitivefunction. The existence of the physiological systems is not in doubt although there is not universal agreement on theirstructure. There is wide recognition that they regulate the function of organs (in each system), and that there are higherand lower levels for each system (homeostatic limits), however such systems remain an elusive and under-researchedarea of medicine. The Russian researcher I.G.Grakov[28,29] has mathematically modelled the consequences ofcognition upon the autonomic nervous system and physiological systems. This included identifying and mapping thenature and structure of the physiological systems (Table 2).Physiological SystemsSleeping, Breathing, Digestion, Excretion, Osmotic Pressure, Blood Pressure, Blood Cell Content, Blood Volume,Blood Glucose , Sexual Function, pH, Temperature, Posture and Locomotion. See Table 2.Such an explanation is highly inclusive and complete by comparison to the currently accepted but exclusive and limitedexplanation. The essential functions of temperature, sleeping and pH are now included; excretion is not limited tourination; whilst blood cell content (and other related systems) comprise what has hitherto been regarded as the immunesystem. Absorption of nutrients is influenced by system function including (but not limited to) blood pressure, bloodvolume, blood cell content, pH, temperature, etc. Elimination of toxins is similarly influenced by the complexities ofsystem function.The brain manages the autonomic nervous system and the function of the physiological systems. In addition, the brainwaves are in a dynamic relationship with molecular biochemistry illustrating how drugs can be used to influence thebody's biochemistry in order to act upon the symptoms of disease and how brain wave technologies such asneurofeedback can be used to alter the brain waves, physiological systems, organs, cells and molecular bio-chemistry.Such systems regulate the function of the body's biochemistry e.g. (1) Most enzymatic reactions in the body aretemperature dependent and catalysed by Magnesium. (2) The body requires maintenance of pH within a narrowoperating range, and also the supply of minerals and vitamins/cofactors, to catalyse protein-substrate reactions in thebody. (3) Appropriate blood volume, blood pressure, blood cell content and pH are required to ensure optimalabsorption of minerals, vitamins, fatty acids from the intestines.It is increasingly accepted that the synchronised activity of groups of neurons[30] in functionally coherent structures(the physiological systems), which exist in the brain and the body, synchronise their electrical impulses[31]. This maybe evident when noting the evoked visual potentials, indicative of neural synchronisation, which are atypical inautism[32] and which may be part of the processes influencing sense perception (figure 1), sense coordination,memory[33], learning, etc. If so, this indicates that sensory input through the neurovisual pathways is integrated intoactions, behaviour and movement and that learning requires synchronised activity between the brain, sensoryorgans[34-36], and visceral organs. This is severely disrupted in the autistic[37]. Autism affects the function of all ofthe brain[38-40]. It is a neurobiologic, multi-systemic disorder i.e. affecting the function of every organ but notnecessarily its structures[41]. It affects all aspects of the autonomic nervous system and hence influences all aspects ofbrain's function including that of neural networks involved in learning, memory, the function of the senses and thevisceral organs.The cerebellum, considered to be implicated in autistic spectrum disorders[42] comprises an estimated 50% of thebrain's total processing capacity yet its role is not clear or understood[43]. It is involved in the accumulation of sensorydata from the internal environment, including the organs in the body and those in the brain (including the sensoryorgans), thus distinguishing between sensory input from the external environment (a significant function of thecerebrum) and that of the biochemistry affecting the function of every organ (a significant function of the cerebellum),including the cerebellum. Such a role includes the processing, regulation and distribution of this data, through structuressuch as the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum which are attached by nervous structures to every part of the body. Thisincludes the receipt of biosignals involved in the processes of movement, coordination and balance. Impaired flow ofdata to the brain via the cerebellum (and brainstem) may lead to functional problems affecting the body's fine control ofe.g. balance, coordination, etc. Movement and balance involve the coordinated function of all body systems and organsand are coordinated by (1) sensory feedback from the external and internal environments and (2) the allocation ofenergy resources to and from each organ. They are dependent upon the precise nature, and timing, of data about eachorgan being provided to and by the cerebrum and cerebellum. This illustrates how the brain determines behaviour andactions appropriate to developing situations. It illustrates how changes at the organ, cell or molecular level influencebrain function and vice-versa.There are indications of cerebellar dysfunction in autism[44]. Inhibited flow of data to the cerebellum may be followedby developmental decay, cerebellar dysfunction[45,46], and reduced size of brain-stem. This is equivalent to the 'use itor lose it' phenomena affecting muscle tone and function.Without cognitive input the brain cannot and does not function. Disease and drugs create cognitive dysfunction, alteredsense perception, in particular affects visual perception. Accordingly, vaccines must also influence sense perception andcoordination. Vaccines have a long-term influence and hence may have a more pervasive influence upon senseperception.Our cognitive function depends upon the extent and coordination of sense perception i.e. between the eyes, ears, nose,mouth and skin. Genetic and/or environmental influences affect sense perception, the degree of sensory coordinationand ultimately our connectedness with the surrounding world. Visual function is linked to the primary mechanism (rods,cones and pigments) but is also influenced at the biochemical level - noted by how pathology and drugs alter colorperception[22,47] and affect the magnocellular and parvocellular neurovisual pathways which alter color perception andvisual contrast. This influences the stability and function of the autonomic nervous system[48] and alters the processesof memory fixation, concentration, behavior[49].Anyone contracting disease e.g. measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, etc; experiences altered visual perception therefore aweakened strain of the disease e.g. in vaccines, must also influence visual perception/cognition. Chronic disease is alsoaccompanied by significant cognitive dysfunction and influences the coordination and processing of sense signals by thebrain. The greater the number of illnesses, drugs or vaccines[50] the greater the alteration to the body's biochemistrytherefore the greater its influence upon sense function and the degree of sensory distortion. It influences the autonomicnervous system and physiological systems and hence the coordination and function of every organ - visceral andsensory. This is a significant feature of autism[51,52].Almost all diseases are linked to cognitive and behavioral disorders. Conversely, behavioral traits are influenced bybiochemistry e.g. testosterone, oestrogen, cortisol, oxytocin, adrenaline, etc. Oxytocin influences the formation of socialbonds influencing social engagement and attachment - which are dysfunctional in the autistic child[53-57].Autonomic nervous system dysfunction?In general problems with the stability of the autonomic nervous system[21,58] can be expected to be manifest asfollows:Loss of Sense perception and Sensory CoordinationSystem dysfunction (e.g. influencing breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, etc)Behavioural dysfunction (including learning problems, information feedback)BackgroundProblems with Diet and Elimination (of toxins and wastes)Impaired and/or Delayed Neural DevelopmentAtypical brain wavesThese are prevalent in autism.Evidence of Systemic Dysfunction in AutismMulti-systemic dysfunction is associated with a wide range of physiological disorders e.g. diabetes and obesity[59],cancer, cardiovascular disorders, pre-eclampsia, dyslexia[60], depression, etc. It affects the central[39] and autonomicnervous system in autistic children[61]. Systemic dysfunction in Autism includes that of temperature, blood cell contentand immune function[62], blood pressure[63,64], digestion, excretion, posture and locomotion, Each influences metabolic rate[68]. Autonomic dysfunction hasalso been linked to problems with appetite, swallowing food, nausea, recurrent vomiting, and abdominal bloating;constipation or diarrhoea; dry eyes, dilated pupils; dry skin, flushed skin following a meal, abnormal sweating, andunexplained high fevers; sleep apnoea, insomnia; bed-wetting, difficulty alteredperception of pain, sensory defensiveness, poor socialisation skills, anxiety, phobias, tics, emotional instability; andlight intolerance. That autistic seizures are often linked to neural blood flow[69-71] is supported by fact thatmedications used to raise or lower blood pressure can alter the occurrence of seizures and improve sleep in the autisticchild.Autism affects sensory processing and sensory coordination[72] which is manifest in various ways e.g. tactileperception[73], vision[74], hearing[75], and smell. Autistic children may also display synaesthesia in which sensationsbecome confused with one another[76]. Sounds may be experienced as touch or as visual stimulation e.g. autisticchildren may cover their eyes when they hear a loud sound. That autistic children have such sensory synaesthesia andsensitivity may indicate that their brains have extreme problems with sensory processing, regulation andcoordination[77,78,60].Vaccines and Vaccine Side-effectsThe introduction of modified live viruses as vaccines enable the virus to attach its genetic material into thecell which replicates i.e. the host cell continues to function whilst producing the viral protein. This stimulates theproduction of antibodies. Under normal circumstances exposure to a viral disease would be countered (in vivo) atvarious levels enabling the body to steadily increase its immune response. By contrast, the injection of vaccines directlyinto the blood system overpowers the normal immune response leading to its rapid depletion. It is now suspected thatlong-term persistence of viruses and other proteins may produce chronic disease i.e. instead of producing a genuineimmunity the vaccines are altering the body's systemic and biochemical stability, suppressing the production of differingtypes of white blood cells and hence immune function. Furthermore the introduction of many vaccines (up to 30 in atypical vaccination schedule) introduces a large number of foreign proteins which may be sufficient to ensure thatimmune function never returns to baseline and/or that immune biochemistry is fundamentally altered[62]. Consequentlythere now exists a growing concern which links immunizations to the huge increase in recent decades of auto-immunediseases[79] rheumatoid the balance of viral scavengers[82,83]. They suppress the production of b-cells, t-cells, etc. Thesynergistic action of these cells impairs antibody formation and becomes less effective in phagocytosis. This influencesrecognition of viral pathogens, leads to the progressive failure of immune function and hence to the increased incidenceof auto-immune disease which we note as allergies[84-86] and immunodeficiency[87].Some vaccinations have a greater effect than others e.g. Hib vaccine, pertussis vaccine[88-90], measles vaccine[91],etc. Indeed some articles indicate that the use of such vaccines can reliably induce asthma[92] by moderating adrenergicfunction[93].Modified live viruses alter the structure and function of DNA. Each virus is a large molecule therefore its spatialarrangement must be influenced by its biochemistry which influences cross-helical structures and linkages within theDNA helix. Accordingly it is inevitable that the steady accumulation of such foreign proteins arising from an intensivevaccine programme will reach the stage where it significantly weakens DNA, gene, and chromosome structure andfunction. The prevailing reaction conditions - the consequence of protein expression which has been influenced byprevious vaccines - will also affect the introduction of each modified live virus. Each will depress immune function. TheDiphtheria, Polio, Tetanus, Meningitis, Pertussisgreater the number of viruses and foreign proteins (1) the greater the influence upon immune function and the timerequired for recovery from each vaccination; (2) the greater their influence upon DNA, gene and chromosome structureand function, the greater will be the risk of protein inhibition, system dysfunction, reproduction, etc.The greater the amount of vaccines, introduction of foreign proteins and hence of alterations to the body's biochemistrythe greater the risk that the body's immune function no longer recognizes or responds to existing vaccines ordiseases[94] and/or that its immune response has been altered[95] and/or that sugar chains attached to an antibody altersits ability to bind to its receptors[96]. This may lead to mutated forms of disease[97-104] e.g. the reemergence ofwhooping cough[105], and a differentiated disease profile e.g. up to 30 per cent of individuals with a persistent coughare infected with B. pertussis[106]. Furthermore enhanced susceptibility to virus infection by vaccines isdocumented[107]. This could enable tougher strains to flourish[108].Vaccines are not entirely safe. The currently used vaccines are merely less unsafe than previous vaccines[109,110] e.g.The Urabe strain of mumps vaccine in the MMR vaccine was replaced by the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain inresponse to reports from Japan linking the Urabe strain used, in the MMR vaccine, with high levels ofmeningoencephalitis.The Pluserix-MMR and Immramax-MMR vaccines were withdrawn because of reports of mild transientmeningitis. The withdrawal of the smallpox vaccination led to a reduction in the incidence of TB.The Rubini vaccine continues to be used in some European territories although discredited[111].Leningrad-Zagreb strain is commonly used in developing countries, and may have superior efficacy when usedduring epidemics[112,113].Different strains of disease have different safety profiles[114]Different strengths of vaccine[115] carry risks which affect age groups or sexes differently.There are concerns over the use of whole-cell vaccines[116,117] although some argue that acellular vaccines areless effective[118].Sudden Infant Death Syndrome has been largely eradicated following withdrawal of the pertussis vaccine inSweden and Japan.Side-effects arising from vaccination are associated with the onset of autoimmune disease[79,119], arthritis,diabetes mellitus, autoimmune demyelinative optic neuritis, common side-effect of vaccines[120-122] e.g. sensori-neural hearing loss induced by theMMR vaccine.Drugs inhibit the effectiveness of vaccines (see 3.3.2). Systemic glucocorticoids (steroids) suppress the immunesystem and create risk of disseminated infection from live virus vaccines[123]. Vaccines may also be influencedby levels of immune function, dietary factors, and stress[124]. Many parents of autistic children and a number ofmedical experts believe the MMR vaccine is the culprit behind autism. In c15-20% of children it causes fever 7-12 days following immunization.What are the risks from the diseases against which a vaccine is meant to protect?Diptheria[125], Polio and Pertussis have largely been eradicated inthe developed world although there may now be mutated forms of disease, a differentiated disease profile and/or analtered immune profile, which may be responsible for further outbreaks in vaccinated children and adults. Diphtheria isan upper respiratory tract infection characterized by sore throat and minor fever. It affects the central and peripheralnervous systems leading to deterioration of myelin sheaths, loss of motor control and sensation. Fatality rates are 5-10%although the rate of mortality may be higher for those under 5 years and over 40 years. It can be treated by antibioticswhich prevent its transmission e.g. using erythromycin, procaine penicillin G, rifampin or clindamycin. Other minorcomplications including neck swelling, nausea, vomiting, listlessness, pallor, and a racing heart beat; lead to long termeffects e.g low blood pressure, cardiac myopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Poliomyelitis is an infectious viral disease.Although c90% of polio infections are symptom-free, if the virus enters blood circulation this may lead to furthercomplications. In c1% of cases, where the virus enters the central nervous system, it infects and/or destroys motorneurons thereby leading to muscle weakness and paralysis, usually involving the legs. Tetanus infection occurs throughopen wounds. It occurs commonly in hot, damp climates with soil rich in organic matter. It creates muscle spasms in thejaw, difficulty in swallowing, muscle stiffness and spasms throughout the body. The neonatal form of the disease is aMeasles, Mumps and Rubella What are the risks from the Vaccine? Typical vaccine side-effectssignificant public health problem in the developing and/or agricultural economies. There are about one million cases oftetanus reported each year, mainly in the developing world, causing an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 deaths. In theUnited States, there are about five deaths from tetanus each year. Tetanus is the only disease that is infectious but notcontagious. Pertussis is a highly contagious disease. There are 10-90 million pertussis cases and about 600,000 deathsper year. Sixty percent of all cases occur in the developing world. In children it is characterized initially by mildrespiratory infection symptoms before developing into the characteristic 'whooping' cough. Other complications mayinclude encephalitis, pneumonia, and secondary bacterial infections. Naturally-acquired disease caused by Hib (H.influenza) appears only to occur in humans with low natural immunity[126]. In infants and young children, H. influenzatype b may cause pneumonia, and acute bacterial meningitis. Both H. influenza and S. pneumonia can be found in theupper respiratory system of humans i.e. both reside naturally in the body. Alterations in the immune response; attributedto poor nutrition, stress or transmission; enable their proliferation with potentially serious outcomes.Measles is largely a consequence of compromised immunity arising from poor diet andis linked to high levels of mortality[127] in the developing world. In developed countries, most children are immunizedagainst measles by the age of 18 months, generally as part of the triple vaccine treating measles, mumps and rubella(children younger than 18 months usually retain measles antibodies (Immunoglobulins (Ig)) transmitted from themother during pregnancy). The rate of mortality from measles is typically 0.3% however in the developing world thismay be as high as 28%. The classical symptoms of measles are typically fever (up to 40C), cough, coryza andconjunctivitis. Complications include mild diarrhoea, pneumonia, encephalitis, SSPC, and corneal ulceration orscarring. They are usually more severe amongst adults. Permanent hearing loss or damage to vision is recognizedcomplications of measles. Measles has been known to occur in children with congenital rubella syndrome, and has beenimplicated in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). The more common symptoms of mumps areparotitis, fever (typically 38.3C), headache and orchitis[128] Other symptoms of mumps include sore face and/or ears,and loss of voice. Known complications of mumps include infection of other organ systems, sterility in older men, mildforms of meningitis, encephalitis, sensorineural hearing loss, pancreatitis, inflammation of the ovaries, and risk ofspontaneous abortion during pregnancy. Rubella is a mild disease which often passes unnoticed[129]. The primaryreason for the introduction of a vaccine is to prevent infection during pregnancy. The common symptoms of rubella arethe appearance of a rash on the face, trunk and limbs (after an incubation period of 14-21 days) which usually fadesafter several days. Other symptoms include fever (typically 38C), swollen glands (post cervical lymphadenopathy), jointpains, headache and conjunctivitis. Rubella is generally a mild disease, rare in infants or those over the age of 40. Theolder the person the more severe the symptoms e.g. some women experience arthritis type symptoms. Children exposedto rubella in the womb may show developmental delay, inhibited growth, hearing disabilities, diabetes, glaucoma,schizophrenia, etc. If infected during the first 12 week period of pregnancy this may lead to congenital rubella syndrome(CRS), which is manifest as a series of complications including spontaneous abortion and, in the neonate: cardiac,cerebral, ophthalmic and auditory side-effects. Known complications include prematurity, low birth weight, andneonatal thrombocytopenia, anemia and hepatitis. CRS is the main reason a vaccine for rubella was developed. Itincreases the risk of miscarriage or still birth in mothers who contract rubella shortly before or early in pregnancy. If thebaby survives, it may have heart disorders, blindness, deafness, etc. CRS is manifest as sensorineural deafness, eyeproblems, heart disease. Other complications include low birth weight, mental retardation, problems with the spleen,liver and bone marrow, etc. Hepatitis B is difficult to catch and comes from blood or sexual contact with an infectedcarrier. Further, vaccine-derived immunity is thought to be short-lived. Hpv , an infection transmitted during sexualintercourse, clears naturally after several months/years. Mumps and Rubella may occur without the patient being awarethat they have the disease.Some diseases may confer natural immunity e.g. the mumps virus may confer a degree of immunity against ovariancancer[130-133].In summary, disease side-effects reflect the effect of the disease upon the body's functional systems i.e. upontemperature, digestion, excretion, etc. Typical viral fevers are circa 1-2C above the body's normal body temperature.Measles is particularly noteworthy because fever may reach 40C (or higher), some 3-4C above normal bodytemperature and just 1C below the point where proteins denature and at which brain death commences.There is evidence that BCG and measlesvaccinations administered singly reduce child mortality[134] but that this is unrelated to the incidence of measles ormeasles deaths[135,136]. By contrast the pertussis vaccine is associated with a negative effect[137].Dtap: Recorded common side-effects with the DtaP vaccine include fever, tiredness, poor appetite, vomiting andinflammation. Less common and more severe side-effects include distress (crying), seizures, lowered consciousness orcoma, brain damage.The Cumulative Effect of VaccinesVaccine-vaccine and Vaccine-drug interactions Effectiveness of Vaccines/Vaccines are not 100% effectiveMMR: Recorded common side-effects with the MMR vaccine include fever, swelling of the lymph glands, tiredness,poor appetite, and abhorrence of bright lights. More severe problems include low platelet count, pain and stiffness in thejoints/inflammation. Less common and more severe side-effects include distress (crying), seizures, deafness, loweredconsciousness or coma, brain damage.Tdap: Recorded common side-effects with the Tdap vaccine include pain, chills, fever, headache, tiredness, poorappetite, stomach ache, vomiting, diarrhoea and inflammationThe above listed vaccine side-effects are indicative of systemic instability affecting most physiological systems -temperature (chills and fever), excretion (inflammation of the lymph glands), blood cell content (low platelet count),excretion (diarrhoea), digestion (poor appetite, vomiting), sleep (coma), and metabolic rate (tiredness, lowered levels ofconsciousness). In addition there is evidence of altered sense perception, indicative of problems with the autonomicnervous system, which affects hearing, visual perception (abhorrence of bright lights), smell and touch.Significant vaccine side-effects have been linked to swine flu vaccine (Guillain-Barre paralysis); in RSV vaccine[138];in the vaccine; smallpox vaccine;polio vaccine; pertussis vaccine[141], etc. The incidence of vaccine side-effects may now be sufficiently great toquestion the claims that the risks from the disease exceed that of vaccines[109].The MMR vaccine has been linked to autism, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease[142,143] and other seriouschronic stomach problems[144], epilepsy, brain damage including meningitis[145,146], cerebral palsy, pancreatitis[147]and diabetes mellitus[148-150], encephalopathy, encephalitis[151,152], hearing and vision problems, arthritis,behavioural and learning problems, chronic fatigue syndrome, and death.There is evidence that in cases of immune deficiency that viruses continue to persist in the body[143,153-155]. Themeasles virus is known to persist in panencephalitis (SSPE), measles inclusion the introduction of measles vaccines, vaccine-associatedSSPE has increased in the USA. Furthermore patients with B or T-cell immunodeficiencies have cognitive side-effects[27] and are advised against vaccination due to the risk of severe and/or fatal infection (Merck). That virusespersist in the body and are linked to autoimmune disorders is a feature of rubella virus[158-160], anthraxvaccination[161], hepatitis B[162], etc. There is a reported increased risk of death with combined vaccination DPT andpolio[134].In summary, vaccine's side-effects reflect the vaccine's influence upon the body's functional systems i.e. upontemperature, digestion, excretion, blood cell content, etc.There is concern that the cumulative effect of vaccines upon the body's functionhas not been properly assessed[137]. Unvaccinated children appear to have less exposure to disease[84,85], delayingvaccination reduces exposure to disease[163], contracting the disease naturally leads to less disease in future[164], andthat excessive vaccination is considered ineffective and dangerous[165].In general, vaccines may be influenced by antibiotics[166],immunoglobulins, immunosuppressants, monoclonal antibodies, anticoagulants and corticosteroids. The interactionbetween a vaccine and a drug has been reported only with influenza vaccine and four drugs (aminopyrine, phenytoinsodium, theophylline, and warfarin sodium), and with BCG vaccine and theophylline. The clinical significance ofvaccine-drug interactions is not fully determined[167]. There is further evidence of interactions involving most Vaccine: formaldehyde), rotavirus vaccine, etc.Vaccines are not subject to double blind clinical trials despite the evidence of vaccine-drug interactions and perhaps alsoof vaccine-vaccine interactions.Whooping cough is becoming increasinglyprevalent[168-170]. Although claimed to be 88 per cent effective among children of 7-18 months, during a nationwideepidemic of whooping cough in 1993, a group of researchers discovered that 82 per cent had completed their fullcomplement of DPT vaccines[171]. Others have commented that the whooping cough vaccine is only to be 36%effective[109].Effect upon Learning Biochemical Instability The use of Drugs The Cause of AutismMany studies show that the measles vaccine isn't completely effective[172-175] and that a significant proportion ofthose infected in measles outbreaks (>60%) had been vaccinated. There is also a lack of consensus concerning theeffectiveness of whole or acellular vaccines, each having their own side-effects and effectiveness[176] e.g. vaccineefficacy was estimated at 75.4% for an acellular 5 component vaccine, 42.4% for an acellular two component vaccineand 28% for a whole cell DTP vaccine[177]. The whole-cell vaccine was associated with different levels of side-effectsincluding significantly higher rates of crying, cyanosis, fever, and local reactions than the other three vaccines.There is evidence of declining vaccine immunity[178] illustrated by transmission of mumps[179], smallpox, diphtheria, varicella[188], whoopingcough[189], etc.One in 14 children i.e. up to half of all children starting school, have problems with speech,language and communication[190]. Is this significant bearing in mind[4] that the occurrence of autism may be morewidely spread than has hitherto been considered possible i.e. that only the most severe and chronic cases of autism arerecorded? Learning problems are a significant problem in autism[191]. It affects the body's processing of data from theexternal and internal environments. This affects, in the autistic, the ability of the autonomic nervous system to regulateorgan function and hence influences their ability to make sense of the external world. The problem may be part of aspectrum of biochemical disorders[60] influencing all aspects of the learning process e.g. including memory,concentration, sense perception and sense coordination.Biochemical EvidenceIndications of almost complete physiological instability are manifest in the autistic as aproliferation of biochemical deficiencies e.g. (1) Fatty acid deficiency[192]; (2) a distinctly different immuneresponse[62] including reduced natural killer cell activity[193], decreased immunoglobulins and T cells and alteredlymphocyte functions[194,195-197], (3) Vitamin D deficiency[198]. Vitamin D regulates the levels of glutathionewhich may explain the link between heavy metals and autism. Depleted levels of glutathione increase oxidative stress,suppress the detoxifying effect of liver enzymes e.g. P450, reduce the elimination of heavy metals, and increase theneurodegenerative effects of heavy metals. Mercury inhibits the enzyme methionine synthase which convertshomocysteine into methionine. Accordingly, and metallothionine are low. This illustratesthat the methionine pathway may be faulty in many with autism and supports earlier suggestions that redoximbalances[199-200] and detoxification are impaired. (4) Vitamin A deficiency[201-202] is a commonly observedsymptom of measles. The severity of complications have been linked to the degree of Vitamin A deficiency; (5)Carnitine deficiency[203]; (6) increased norepinephrine levels and decreased dopamine-hydroxylase (7)demonstration of inter- and intra- species differences in serotonin binding sites by antibodies from an autisticchild[205]; (8) the levels of gut flora[206]; (9) Enterocolitis in Children with Developmental Disorders[207]; (10)Adenosine Deaminase Activity Decreased in Autism[208,209]; (11) Small intestinal enteropathy with epithelial, IgGand complement deposition in children with regressive autism[210]; (12) Mitochondrial disorder[211]. Findings suggestthat mitochondrial function, mitochondrial structure, and mitochondrial DNAintegrity, may be instability is a feature of autism. Accordingly, drugs are used to mitigate autisticsymptoms e.g. (1) Lofexidine[213] has been shown to improve prefrontal cortical function in nonhuman primates. Thisis consistent with the view that the prefrontal cortex regulates executive/system function. (2) An open trial[214]suggested that methylphenidate use in autistic hyperactive children may ameliorate hyperactivity, and impulsivity inautistic children. (3) Neuroleptics mildly effective in reducing hyperactivity, impulsivity, andinattention in children with autistic disorder[215]; clonidine is used in the treatment of tic disorders and ADHD[216].Other drugs used include Tianeptine[217]; Galanthamine[218]; Immunoglobulins[219]; melatonin[220]; and beta-blockers[221].The occurrence of autism is due to a significant genetic insult[222] but it is not considered to bean inheritable condition. How and when this occurs can be debated however, for a young child with a developingimmune system, there are few factors which could be held responsible other than vaccines and/or the related anddamaging effect of exposure to high levels of mercury. No other factor or explanation has been offered as a viablealternative explanation for the occurrence of regressive autism. The evidence indicates there is alteration tochromosome structure and/or function. It indicates the influence of external stressor(s) influencing mitochondrialstructure and DNA, chromosomal instability and translocation, which ultimately influences protein expression. Thecombined effect influences system stability, organ function, the prevailing levels of biochemistry, sense perception,behavior, etc. It influences protein expression and the rate and completeness of subsequent protein-substrate reactionsleading to lowered immune function, reduced absorption of nutrients, slowed metabolism, impaired development[262],etc; i.e. the body's biochemical processes do not proceed as they should.Is this an indication of chromosomal damage?Viruses are able to infiltrate cells, inserting their genetic material into them. As outlined earlier (see 4.1) there arebiochemical markers of vaccine damage. That it affects four boys to every girl[10] illustrates that the condition islargely due to a defect with the X-chromosome and leads to consideration of the factors which could influence at thegenetic/chromosomal level. In general, chromosomal damage is linked to radiation e.g. due to adverse nuclear eventswhich leads ultimately to birth defects. The prevailing evidence appears to suggest the influence of e.g. proteolyticenzymes or temperature[223,224] which may alter chromosome structure. Little evidence has been offered for the 1 in 5occurrence experienced by girls although this appears likely to be the consequence of a chromosomal stressor.It is widely recognised that genetic predisposition and protein expression can be influenced by environmentinfluences[7], and that genetic damage can be the result of exposure to radiation, however the evidence being offeredappears to suggest a subtle form of genetic alteration - associated with the wider use of vaccines[17] - which may notnecessarily be inherited but is responsible for altered system stability and function and consequently of alteredbiochemistry and function. There is evidence that system function is intact but dysfunctional i.e. that homeostasis isseverely compromised. Such findings are supported by research into Gulf-War Syndrome (GWS) in which[225]untypical RNA was found in the blood of sick GW veterans. This illustrates that the viral encephalopathies originatedfrom RNA-viruses and hence from vaccines. That immunosuppression, shown to be a factor in GWS[226] and autism,is associated with the concentrated use of vaccines[227] is further supported by the fact that French soldiers who werenot vaccinated yet who served in the gulf war did not get GWS however American and British soldiers[228],irrespective of whether they served in Iraq or not, reported a significantly greater incidence of autistic-spectrumdisorders and GWS.The Effect of Heavy MetalsHeavy Metals and Mercury in particular, affects the function of the CNS and are extensively documented and associatedwith autism[229]. Amongst a variety of side-effects mercury decreases lymphocyte viability, and in the brain:dysfunction in the amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebral of neurons in the cerebellum;and brainstem abnormalities. Demyelination is evident in such conditions. The brain's electrical patterns are similarlyabnormal.The most significant contributors to the increased mercury burden are: Mercury in vaccines (e.g. DTP (at typically 25micrograms of mercury per dose), Tetanus, Hepatitis B & (most) influenza vaccines), contamination of fish[230],wild/bush fires; and emissions from power stations[231] and industrial chimneys including incinerators, waste-burningcement works, crematoria, etc. The characteristics of autism and mercury poisoning are extremely similar whichsuggests that autism arises from mercury poisoning[232,233]. Children with autism have greater amounts of mercuryand other heavy metals in their system[234]. For these children the exposure route is considered to be predominately viachildhood vaccines, most of which contain thimerosal. Vaccinated children of circa 10-20 kgs are exposed to an adultoverdose of mercury, over 62.5 micrograms of mercury within the first three months, which significantly increases achild's risk of developing some form of neuro-developmental disorder such as impaired development, speech andlanguage, autism, stuttering and attention deficit disorder.Children living downstream of coal-fired power stations have a greater incidence of autistic spectrum disorders[231].This indicates that the innate physiological processes, which the body uses to eliminate heavy metals, are beingovercome by overexposure.Mercury poisoning is an insidious process. In general the symptoms do not appear immediately upon exposure,although they may in especially sensitive individuals or in cases of excessive exposure. The initial preclinical stage isfollowed by the development of symptoms of mercury poisoning over a period which may last from weeks, months, andyears[235-237]. Consequently, mercury given in vaccines to very young children would not be expected to lead to arecognizable disorder, except for subtle signs, before age 6-12 months, and might not emerge for several years[233].In autistic children, the initial signs occur shortly after the first injections, and consist of abnormalities in motorbehavior and in the sensory systems, particularly touch sensitivity, vision, and numbness in the mouth[15,238]. Thesesigns are followed by parental reports of speech and hearing abnormalities appearing before the child's secondbirthday[10]. Finally, there is the development of autistic-like traits and a continuing regression or lack of developmentin subsequent years. These symptoms change[239] depending upon the circumstances surrounding each child.Most autistic children have impaired liver detoxification. Many have low levels of metallothionine, conceivably theconsequence of a deficiency of Zinc, which is indicative of a lowered capacity to chelate mercury and other heavymetals. Mercury is a powerful oxidant which depletes cellular antioxidants, especially glutathione. The P450detoxifying enzymes of the liver rely heavily on adequate availability of glutathione. EthylMercury the activecomponent in thimerosal causes apoptosis of the t-cells[240-242].Although the withdrawal of mercury from vaccines has not resulted in an overall decline in the occurrence of autismthis does not mean that the problem does not lie with thimerosal[243,263]. It may indicate that the problem is associatedwith the elimination of mercury[244] i.e. affecting function of the lymphatic system and excretion[245]. This issupported by noting evidence of urea cycle dysfunction. Problems with the urea cycle, conceivably the consequence ofmercury poisoning, have been linked to autism. A child with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is likely tobe lacking in energy, have appetite problems, poorly-controlled breathing rate and/or body temperature, and slowdevelopment. Significantly, OTC deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder(http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec13/ch164/ch164a.html) one of a number of primary immunodeficiencies associatedwith vaccine use.As in autism, onset of Hg toxicity symptoms is gradual in some cases, sudden in others[232,233]. In the case ofpoisoning, the first signs to emerge are abnormal sensation and motor disturbances. As exposure increases, these signsare followed by speech problems, and hearing deficits[246]. Upon removal of the mercury the symptoms tend to recedeexcept in instances of severe poisoning, which may lead to death[232]. As in autism, epilepsy arising from Hg exposureis also associated with a poor prognosis[247]. Mercury acts upon the catecholamines and influences the function of theautonomic nervous system[245]. This affects cognitive performance[248], spatial vision[249], etc.Other metals have been implicated in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children e.g. lead andmercury[250,251], with exposure to cadmium, arsenic, antimony and chromium also a concern. Studies have foundadverse effects of prenatal lead exposure on growth and development, but little research has examined an associationwith autism. Whilst Mercury is of concern, because of evidence for neurotoxic effects and the fact that it has become soprevalent in the wider environment[250], Aluminum also shares common mechanisms with mercury e.g. it interfereswith cellular and metabolic processes in the nervous system. Children given the recommended vaccinations are injectedwith nearly 5 mg of aluminum by the time they are just 1.5 years old, almost 6 times the safe level. Furthermore thenature of the Aluminium affects the prevailing blood levels and is also increasingly implicated, through their use asvaccine adjuvants, in autism[252].Current Therapeutic Approaches used to Treat AutismThere is evidence that autism is a treatable disease and that some therapies can mitigate the effects of autism[253,254].Although there is no recognised method of treatment, or of significant and/or proven outcomes, autistic children appearto respond to therapies which enhance the function of the breathing , to enhance oxygen levels[255], and excretorysystem e.g. by osteopathy[256]. Moreover a commonly observed side-effect with autistic children is that when a childhas an elevated temperature, perhaps resulting from a fever, the autistic symptoms appear to recede and the childbehaves normally[41]. Autistic children suffer from adverse sleep patterns. In the US autistic children are often treatedby chelation therapy and biofeedback[257-259].Dysfunction of the Excretory or lymphatic system leads to long-term exposure to mercury which under normalcircumstances would have been rapidly eliminated from the body. This may also lead to higher neural temperatureswhich will inevitably influence brain function.Further evidence of biochemical deficits[260] and of the benefit of biochemical based supplements e.g. vitamin B6 andmagnesium; melatonin; andtrimethylglycine (TMG). DMG provides DMG comesfrom TMG of Vitamin A Palmitate requires an intact gutmucosa at the appropriate pH and in the presence of bile for metabolism. Many autistic children have damaged mucosalsurfaces therefore they have impaired capacity to absorb vitamin A[261].That some children can become normal when their temperature increases above normal levels e.g. due to a viralinfection,[41] may illustrate that the levels of the homeostatic mechanism affecting the physiological systems have beenreset at what can be considered to be abnormal levels[47]. This may indicate that autism is treatable - perhaps to agreater degree than has hitherto been considered possible.DiscussionThe mass of scientific evidence compiled by researchers clearly indicates that the incidence of autism occurs followingvaccination and is most closely associated with the schedule of vaccines culminating in the MMR vaccine. Thatvaccines suppress natural immune function is not in dispute e.g. those with naturally low levels of immune function(immigrants from tropical climates) show greater predisposition to autistic spectrum disorders.The immediate effect arising from vaccination influences gene function and protein expression. This leads to lowerlevels of white blood cells including e.g. lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, t-cells, b-cells and/or neutrophils, and disturbstheir synergistic action and hence their ability to memorize and respond to immune responses when challenged. Thisimpairs the ability to kill pathogens thereby predisposing to further infections. The short and long-term outcome is tothe neural mechanisms regulating system function affecting e.g. pH, the excretory system, temperature, and theelimination of toxins and heavy metals. This explains why the discontinuation of thimerosal in vaccines was followedby a steady increase in the incidence of autism and hence that researchers did not find a correlation between theincidence of autism and the use of thimerosal-containing vaccines[263]. This may also explain the effect of multiplevaccines, in particular the MMR vaccine, and the greater predisposition to autistic spectrum disorders in militaryfamilies.In most autistic children brain structures are initially unaffected but become steadily underdeveloped as a consequenceof exposure to mercury and other heavy metals. This evolves into a neurodevelopmental problem leading tochromosomal abnormalities, affecting myelination, the subsequent degeneration of the cerebellum, etc.The MMR triple vaccine may inhibit normal immune function which, directly or indirectly, ultimately leads tochromosomal and/or genetic damage and/or dysfunction. The occurrence of GWS in adults, a condition with manyfeatures which are common with autism, indicates the problem may be due to the number and/or intense schedule ofvaccinations however this does not excuse the measles or MMR vaccine from suspicion. The combined vaccine raisesbody temperature whilst lowering immune and system function. This may make a mild measles vaccine more virulentwhich may increase fever to an abnormally high level. It suggests (1) single vaccines may pose less risk than triplevaccines; (2) some vaccines pose a greater risk than others e.g. pertussis and measles; and (3) the way in which vaccinesare administered will be accompanied by different side-effects e.g. if pertussis is followed by measles or vice-versa, ifBCG gives a beneficial effect to be followed by pertussis, if vaccines are given in combination, etc. Increased diseaseloading is the inevitable consequence of multiple vaccine or lots of single vaccines or triple vaccines e.g. of asthma,autoimmune disease, etc. It suggests that adherence to the vaccine schedule is the problem - too many vaccines, tooquickly.Vaccines cause an inflammatory response in some e.g. for those with an inadequately developed or artificially loweredimmune system, for those genetically predisposed, or perhaps due to viral or bacterial infection. This creates geneticdamage and/or dysfunction and hence influences the brain's ability to regulate the physiological systems, and especiallyto the lymphatic system and its ability to excrete mercury and heavy metals, would lead to long-term damage andproblems processing sensory/cognitive input. This would inevitably affect the brain's ability to maintain a regulatedtemperature below that which affects brain damage (41\u00b0 C). This inevitably influences the autonomic nervous systemand the stability of all related physiological systems including temperature, blood pressure, blood cell content, bloodglucose, digestion, excretion, sleeping, etc.Further evidence of multi-level dysfunction is evident from unusual brain-wave stability, aberrant sleep patterns, loss ofsense perception and coordination, mirror neuron dysfunction, lower pain thresholds, mental and physical deterioration,short periods of concentration, etc. That it is a problem of systemic dysfunction is further supported by noting how itcan be treated using sensory therapies which may facilitate the re-establishment of some degree of physiologicalstability.Where is the proof that vaccines are safe? The argument has never been that they are completely safe but that theconsequences are less than having the disease. Now it is illustrated that the consequences of intensive vaccinationschedules pose a greater risk than could ever have been imagined. This leads to the evolution of new viral strains, anunsurprising development when the environment to which it is exposed is being altered by new proteins, structuralvariants and altered DNA.Vaccines are an essential component of preventative healthcare however it may be necessary to review the ways inwhich vaccines are used, administered and regulated[141,264] i.e.As drugs are tested in the clinical environment to assess their interaction with other drugs, the cumulative use ofvaccines including that of multiple vaccines should be researched and shown, through double-blind placebocontrolled clinical trials, to be free from any such interactions i.e. of one single vaccine with another single ormultiple vaccine or drug. It has been considered unethical to select a control group of children which wouldotherwise not be vaccinated yet such is the levels of conscientious objectors in the industrialized world andthrough circumstances of impoverishment in the underdeveloped countries that such statistics must currentlyexist.Measures to assess the suitability of children for vaccination i.e. how to assess whether a child has a greaterpredisposition to an adverse vaccine reaction and the subsequent development of autism?[265]The time when vaccinations should be given and the time between vaccinations e.g. giving mumps and rubellavaccinations later in childhood.Are some vaccines necessary in the industrialized world e.g. mumps, rubella, Hib, Hpv, etc? With more than 200other vaccines under development this must be an issue of review.The risks from disease and vaccinations differ upon location. In the developed world, there is an estimated 0.1-0.3% riskof mortality from measles which compares with a 0.6% risk and rising (with some estimates at 1-2%) of autism. Thisexcludes the cost of treating the wide range of side-effects which must clearly be attributed to the use of vaccines. Thecost of treating vaccine-related side-effects may now be far greater than the diseases against which the vaccine(s) weredesigned to protect. Furthermore, in the developed world there is a highly developed social structure which is able toassist parents to deal with the condition. By comparison, what are the implications for an autistic child in the developingworld where there is absence of resources to deal with the condition?Statement of InterestGraham and Elena Ewing (Dr) are Directors of Montague Healthcare a company devoted to the commercialisation ofVirtual Scanning and hence to the diagnostic and therapeutic use of Virtual Scanning.
