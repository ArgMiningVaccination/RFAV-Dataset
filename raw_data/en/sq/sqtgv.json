It includes all members of the Total Army: the Active Army, the Reserve Components (Reserves and National Guard), the Army Family, the Civilian Corps, Veterans, and the Retired Corps, and has three purposes: 1. To share some of the knowledge and practi cal experience of members of the Army's Noncommissioned Officer Corps. NCO knowledge and experience is invaluable, for the challenges of military service can only be met through leadership, training, and teamwork, and NCOs provide more than three -quarters of the Army's leadership. 2. To recognize the contributions of the Noncommissioned Officer Corps to the Army and the Nation, for as Tom Clancy wrote, noncommissioned officers are \"the guys who make the Army work.\" 3. To encourage more writing by and about the Army's Noncommissioned Officer Corps. NCO wisdom is both practical and profound, and forms a body of knowledge essential to the accomplishment of the Army's mission. Grateful acknowledgment is made for the support provided by the staff of the Pentagon Library, Center of Military History, U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy Historical Office, U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy Learning Resources Center, U.S. Army Museum of the Noncommissioned Officer, and the Office of the Chief, Public Affairs (Comma nd Information), in particular Debbie Reed, Dr. Robert Wright, Linda Gaunt, Marijean Murray, L.

Well -qualified soldiers, physically and mentally toughened by hard training, led by competent and caring leaders and dedicated to preserving the values they and their fellow countrymen live by, make the critical difference between a successful and unsuccessful Army. -SMA Glen E. Morrell , \"What Soldiering Is All About.\" ARMY , Oct 1986, pp. 40, 42 All trainers have one objective: To develop the best possible soldier with the available time and resources. Obviously the emphasis is on developing a soldier's technical and leadership skills for combat. To develop these two skills , NCOs must concentrate primarily on the soldier's ability to successfully accomplish individual tasks. They must also teach their soldiers how important unit cohesion is for mission accomplishment. Individuals do not win wars; squads, platoons, and compan ies do. -CSM Charles T. Tucker , \"NCOs: The Passport to Effective Training.\" Engineer , Fall 1985, p. 9 Isn't it beautiful when a plan comes together? Those words call to my mind the \"sift...chunk\" of glass forming patterns in a kaleidoscope- parts of the plan falling into place as if by magic and mirrors. Engineer soldiers can make a bridge seem to come together that way, or raise a building, or execute airfield damage repairs with clockwork precision. But mirrors aren't in our TO&Es - and our magic is a thing called TRAINING. -CSM Matthew Lee , \"Bridge the Gap.\" Engineer , Mar 1988, p. 3 The natural enemy to courage is not fear; it is self -doubt. To eliminate self -doubt is to begin to teach courage. To eliminate self -doubt, we train. We train to build competence, and competence builds confidence, and confidence builds courage.... You do not tear down a soldier to build up his courage. Rather, you guide the soldier into little victory after little victory: telling the truth, leading a PT formation, and standing before a promotion board. Courage is developed in training where it is safe to succeed, and safe to fall. -SSG William Parrish , \"Leadership and What It Means to Me.\" AUSA fi les, no date or page number [MG Frederick von Steuben ] gave the American Army life when it was nearing death at Valley Forge. One reason for the renewed life was the great care he gave to the training and responsibilities o f NCOs. -William T. Licatovich -Apr 1989 p. 21 Noncommissioned officers are...at the heart of the Army training system. -GEN Donn A. Starry , \"Sergeants' Business.\" Military Review , May 1978, p. 6 All NCOs in our Army (the Active, National Guard, and Reserve) are trainers. -SMA Julius W. Gates , \"Sergeant to Sergeant.\" Sergeants' Business , Mar -Apr 1988, p. 4 Train ing is not a spectator sport.... If training is boring, it's probably not good training. If it's exciting, then you want more hours. -CSM Bobby Butler , in \"Iron Time Training.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1989, p. 9 It is not by harangues at the moment of engaging that soldiers are rendered brave. Veterans hardly listen to them and recruits forget them at the first discharge of a cannon. -Napoleon , The Military Maxims of Napoleon , 1827, pp. 425- 426 Training t he soldier...is where the leather hits the pavement, and I want to be where the action is.... I realized that training soldiers was my calling, being an NCO. I felt I was a good NCO, and I felt I would be a good [commissioned] officer, but I think I have m ore to offer the Army as an NCO. -Army Reserve Drill Sergeant Christopher A. Baer , in \"SSgts. Baer and Edington- The 1989 Drill Sergeants of the Year.\" ARMY , Jun 1989, p. 32 Everyone in our Army recognizes the importance of the noncommissioned officer as a trainer. Drill sergeants mold and build our young recruits into soldiers. Unit sergeants and corporals continue to train our soldiers individually and as a team to accomplish the unit mission. In the final analysis, it is the noncommissioned officer who will lead our nation's best against the odds and win. -SMA Julius W. Gates , \"From the Top.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1989, p. 4 As I travel around, I'm often ask ed, \"How are things at TRADOC?\" The question refers to TRADOC HQ. My response is: \"TRADOC is out there, where the rubber meets the road, wherever TRADOC trainers are training and producing soldiers for the Army.\" -CSM William J. H. Peters , \"From the TRADOC CSM.\" Army Trainer , Spring 1985, p. 23 To appeal to the kind of individual we want in the Army, training must be interesting, challenging, and demanding. [Use] spartan and adventure training- training that taxes one's cap abilities, and is exciting. - NCO Education and Professional Development Study , 1971, p. 20 Training 2 We train well on how to survive and win on the battlefield of the future. We had better train well...or that battlefield will be in our own backyard. -CSM John W. Gillis , \"Let the NCO Do His Job.\" Armor , Mar -Apr 1982, p. 8 Gratification comes in full and the rank comes quick when the job and the duty are tough and exciting. -SFC James T. Stinson , in \"Sapper Le ader Course.\" Army Trainer , Spring 1986, p. 9 Practice makes permanent. If everybody practices the common tasks wrong, then they become permanently wrong. Therefore, the drill sergeant has to be certain that the soldiers are being trained correctly. -CSM Philip M. Hadden , in \"Training the Ordnance NCOs of the Next Century.\" Ordnance , May 1990, p. 11 Only perfect practice makes perfect. -SFC Lydia R. Mead , \"The Safety Sixth Sense.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, p. 6 The more stress soldiers overcome in training, the less stress they will experience in combat. Training tasks that require moral and physical courage teach soldiers to deal with fear and anxiety. Tough training teaches them to overcome those fears through their proficiency at a task, and through trust in the competency of others in the team. -CSM George D. Mock and SFC John K. D'Amato , \"Building the Force: 'Skill, Will and Teamwork.' \" NCO Jou rnal, Summer 1991, p. 19 Real sergeants use the term \"good training\" to describe any miserable task. Having duty on your birthday is \"good training.\" Driving 75 kilometers through a German snowstorm in a leaky deuce- and-a-half is \"good training.\" Spending all night in a Korean bar and barfing during PT the next day is \"good training.\" -Dennis Steele , \"Real Sergeants Don't Know What Quiche Is .\" unknown source If a unit is not well trained, its men know it. This fact shakes their confi dence, especially if they anticipate the possibility of using that training in a critical situation. - DA Pam 350 -12, Guide for Squad Leaders , 1967, p. 34 Bravery delays the enemy but cannot compensate for inadequate training. -MAJ William N. Patterson and MSG Philip T. McFarland , with introduction by LTG Julius W. Becton \"Tragedy of Training History.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1983, p. 9 [In Britain] NCOs from well -trained regiments were sometimes \"loaned\" to others. [In 1767] the 17th Foot came home to England from foreign service in a \"very Indifferent Plight\"; and the colonel of the corps \"Expressed his Wishes, that he might have a Serjeant and Corporal with his Regime nt, for some Months, from a well Disciplined Corps.\" -J. A. Houlding , Fit for Service: The Training of the British Army, 1715- 1795, p. 290 A good Serjeant in a bad company, shall finde busines more then inough [till the soldiers] be trayned. -A Path-Way to Military Practise , 1587, no page number The Effectiveness of Training Few humans are worth more than a few dollars a day from their neck down, but there is absolutely no limit to a trained man's earning capacity from his neck up.... Training alone is the one thing which will enable a man to climb out of the rut and get something worth while. - SGT John C. Cherry , \"Secrets of Success.\" U.S. Army Recruiting News , 12 Feb 1921, p. 4 Military training gives...determined persistence of purpose. It gives one a dynamic but abiding will which can always accomplish more than the static or explosive will. -SSG Ray H. Duncan , \"The Value of Military Training.\" U.S. Army Recruiting New s, 1 Mar 1925, p. 12 Underwriting the honest mistakes of aggressive junior NCOs is the biggest trainer and motivator available to our Army today. -ARCOM CDR, NCOPD Study , Vol 2, 1986, p. L -4-8 I tell my sergeants that when they deny a soldier the opport unity to train, especially on the support side of the house, they can be denying his survival. -CSM Alexander Freitas , \"The Cutting Edge.\" Army Trainer , Winter 1985, p. 23 On a recent visit to Europe, I talked to a scout squa d that had won a prestigious award for being the best of its kind in Europe. When I asked one soldier for the secret of his squad's success, he said without any hesitation, \"Sir, that's easy. Hard work and my sergeant.\" -GEN Carl E. Vuono, Collected Works , 1991, p. 163 Training for Combat Training, then- both good and bad- is habit forming. The difference is that one develops the battlefield habits that win; the other gets you killed.... First things first. Training is the most important thing we do in the Army. Don't ever forget that. Don't lose sight of it when you are wrestling with all those other alligators.... A lot of people say, \"Well, I have a lot of training distractors; I have to do this; I have to comply with that...\" There is time for good training if we do the planning and follow guidance. Make it happen. Do not use those distractors Training 3 as a crutch. -SMA Glen E. Morrell , \"As the SMA Sees It.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1984, pp. 21, 24 While the res ponsibilities of officers and noncommissioned officers in time of peace are important, in time of battle they are much more so: for then their mistakes are paid for in human blood. - Manual of Military Training , Vol 1, 1921, p. 265 Success in battle is th e ultimate object of all military training; success may be looked for only when the training is intelligent and thorough.... The excellence of an organization is judged by its field efficiency. The field efficiency of an organization depends primarily upon its effectiveness as a whole. Thoroughness and uniformity in the training of the units of an organization are indispensable to the efficiency of the whole; it is by such means alone that the requisite teamwork may be developed. -Manual for Noncommissione d Officers and Privates of Infantry of the Army of the United States , 1917, p. 50 Remember that everything you do in time of peace- all the training and instruction you receive - is done with but one object in view: To make you efficient and qualify you for your duties in time of war .... Everything we do - all our preparations, all our instructions, and all our training - has for its final purpose nothing but war, and it should also be borne in mind that everything in war is practical. -Noncommissioned Offic ers' Manual , 1917, pp. 19, 27 A high state of training is the best welfare of the troops; training saves lives in combat. In battle, the habits and discipline that have been instilled in training pay off - first, because men in combat will do instinctively what they have been in the habit of doing in training; and second, because only the extra drive of discipline will enable the soldier to overcome the fear that all men experience in battle. -DA Pam 350 -13, Guide for Platoon Sergeants , 1967, p. 18 All az imuths must point in the direction of training. The best form of soldier protection, if we are required to fight, is prior training conducted to the prescribed standards. Simply stated, if we accomplish our training requirements right, when needed, we will inflict more damage on the enemy than he can withstand, and subsequently the fighting will stop. -SMA Julius W. Gates , \"Sergeant to Sergeant.\" Sergeants' Business , Jan - Feb 1988, p. 4 I had been in continuous action for five da ys. During this period none of us had slept more than twelve or fourteen hours. Such rest as we did get was snatched in brief periods of an hour or two. That's when your training paid off. While we were so groggy from fatigue that we could barely move, we reacted to battle situations automatically. We dug in without being told to do so. We kept our rifles and machine guns cleaned, for now we knew that our lives depended upon them. We camouflaged our position, did patrol work, and guard duty. We lost all tra ck of time and distances. Our senses, so keen and sharp at the start of the campaign, were dulled. It was automatic for me to reach up and apply pressure to my arm when I was hit. That was the way I had simulated it a hundred times in training. That was th e way I did it in battle, not because I stopped to think it out, for I was beyond that, but because it had been drilled into me. -a sergeant of the 45th Division, who lost his arm at Salerno, TGGS Special Text No. 1, Leadership for the Company Officer , 1949, pp. 150- 151 [During one combat encounter] it seemed that all I had been taught in my entire lifetime just kicked in and my body went on autopilot. -MSG Roy Benavidez , Medal of Honor , 1995, p. 140 Planning Training Prior preparation and effective supervision are essential to any training program.... The hours and effort [for] preparation and rehearsal, will be repaid in the time and effort saved by not wasting soldiers' time.... It is a good feeling to train hard and accompl ish constructive objectives. No one wants to waste time during \"make-work\" training that does not accomplish anything. Time is too valuable. -SMA Glen E. Morrell , \"Hard Work, Leadership Still Keys to Quality.\" ARMY , Oct 1984, p. 52 The leader has to manage many things which are not specifically involved in - or even supportive of - training. He wants a low rate of disciplinary problems and a high rate of reenlistment. He sends people to motor stables and people to post support. He goes to meetings and gives briefings. His soldiers participate in ceremonies, go on leave, arrive and depart, go AWOL now and then, go on TDY, get more schooling, ask for time off to resolve personal problems, get in trouble, get sick, get promoted, recei ve awards. He has to prepare for the IG, escort VIPs, see that his soldiers and his area look good, budget and control his resources, maintain his equipment to a high standard. In addition to \"all of the above\" and much more- all the day -to-day responsibil ities, generated at a variety of levels, that do not contribute to the unit mission - the officer or NCO has to train his people. He has to ask himself, \"Given our mission and the training we need, how much of my time is available to devote to training?\" T his is something that has to be worked out in the chain of command. The resulting balance of training time versus \"other\" time will have a profound effect on the soldier and his first line supervisor. Training 4 But finding the time for training is only the first step. Even if conditions allow the trainer to achieve the required balance between training and all the distractors from training, there is yet another problem that needs to be solved. The trainer has to bring together all the things that contribute to good training. In other words, he has to find the right combination. The right combination is the best use of all available resources the trainer has to prepare his soldiers and his unit to accomplish the combat mission. -\"The Right Combination: An Approach to Training Management.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1981, p. 32 If you are not training because you are short people, then treat them as if they were battle casualties and ask yourself, \"How do I still accomplish my mission?\" - SMA William A. Connelly , \"For NCO's: Leadership, Hard Work and TRAINING.\" ARMY , Oct 1980, p. 23 In all training situations, always look for the answers to these three questions: 1. WHERE AM I GOING? What must my soldiers do as a result of their training? 2. WHE RE AM I NOW? What can my soldiers do now compared to what I want them to be able to do as a result of training? 3. HOW CAN I BEST GET FROM WHERE I AM TO WHERE I SHOULD BE? What techniques, training methods, and organization offer the most effective and eff icient use of available resources? -The NCO Guide , 1982, p. 29 Planning and preparation are crucial out here [at the NTC]. You have to plan in detail to stop the OPFOR, because there are so many of them and they know the terrain. -SSG Willie Plummer , in \"NTC: Learning the Hard Way.\" Soldiers , Feb 1984, p. 15 Training is one activity in which more cooks simply make for a richer soup.... Once troops start thinking about their own training, it becomes easy to integrate training wi th everything else they are doing. In fact, most training distractors can become training opportunities. Vehicles need washing? When was the last time your crew practiced nuclear, biological, and chemical decontamination procedures? Treat the soap as STP o r DS -2, put on mission -oriented protection posture gear, and give it a shot. -SFC Charles C. Sharp , \"There's Always an Excuse Not to Train.\" Field Artillery , Jul-Aug 1985, p. 10 In the area of combat service support, the exclu sion of NCOs from the operations order planning process equally affects the mission. SGM Glenn E. Shaw , senior logistics trainer at the NTC, says, \"Most CSS NCOs have difficulty executing the required troop leading procedures to su pport the CSS plan. Routinely, they're given neither warning nor fragmentary orders. When they are, seldom is there enough time to properly execute the required troop leading procedures.\"... CSS operations dictate what does and doesn't happen on the battle field. CSS sergeants who lead successful operations know what is expected of their soldiers, execute the plan, and contribute to the outcome of the battle. -CSM Jerry T. Alley , \"The NTC Challenge.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1991, p. 13 If one can find time to think up a make -work project, one also has the time to better plan for training. -SMA William G. Bainbridge , \"The Professional.\" in DA Pam 360-832, CDRS Call -Apr 1977, p. 5 Training manageme nt [taught in the 1SG course] was a big help. I learned about setting up training meetings daily. Now, I get together with my NCOs every evening and talk about what had been accomplished that day and what we need to accomplish the next day. Just sitting down and discussing the operations with my NCOs makes things run smoother the next day. Everything falls right into place. I learned how to get more out of people just by communicating better. -1SG Walter Spann, in \"A Top Course.\" Soldiers , Jul 1984, p. 7 Rehearsals are a key to success in both combat service support and tactical operations. Rehearsals help identify deficiencies prior to combat. -MSG Terry E. Hildebran , NTC Senior Mechanized Trainer, in \"The NTC Challenge.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1991, p. 13 There are many things to consider in developing a plan for squad training. The following are only a few of them: What has the squad done recently in its training?... What is coming in the way of field time?... What tasks in the mission essential task list have not been worked on recently (or at all)? -SGT Don F. Business, Jan -Feb 1990, p. 19 Develop a Pre- Combat Inspection and a pre- execution checklist to make certain your soldiers have everything they need for battle. Tailor the checklist to the platoon and assign soldiers specific tasks. Create a checks -and- balances system to ensure all equipment is there, shortages are identi fied and reported to the company. Break down the checklist to encompass a full company move, a platoon move from a tactical site and preparation for tactical operations. Use the checklist and continually update it. -SFC Lawrence Kordosky , \"OREs Just Tools of the Trade.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1995, p. 18 It's the NCOs who put iron in the chain of train -up for NTC.... Examples of NCO involvement: -The battalion intelligence NCO ensures that all soldiers have been properly trained and tested in visual identification of OPFOR vehicles and aircraft; OPFOR vehicle formations and tactics; correct SPOT report procedures and when to send them; OPSEC (operations security); and stresses maximum use of night Training 5 observation devices, ground sur veillance radar, patrols, and scouts. -The mess steward trains his cooks extensively on field mess operations. He must be prepared to feed assigned and attached soldiers, account for rations, forecast a headcount and not run out of chow. He must work cons tantly at correct field sanitation procedures. He must insist that his cooks set the standard for soldierly appearance. The success of the mess section is critical in terms of morale. -The battalion motor sergeant, through the CSM, first sergeants, and co mpany motor sergeants, drills on operator maintenance, insists on daily DA Form 2404 usage, and monitors the parts -requisition process with a professional eye. He and his mechanics are key players. -The battalion chemical NCO is involved in readying the individual soldier for an NBC environment. How to operate and fight while masked and in protective clothing for extended periods in the desert is vital to mission accomplishment. -The company first sergeant supervises the individual training of his soldier s. He touches all bases with his trainers. He encourages innovation and initiative from his soldiers and NCOs. -The CSM uses his influence with other NCOs on proper dress, conduct, and discipline. He absorbs himself in the training and maintenance effort. He inspects and reinspects. He double- checks the combat load the soldier will pack and carry to NTC. He eyeballs soldiers in their deployment uniforms, making sure that standards are met. The CSM talks to soldiers at every opportunity. He gauges their pro gress through the train- up, with emphasis on individual training.... The Army's best training for its mechanized and armored forces is a two -week rotation at the NTC. Soldiers are pitted against each other in a series of challenging force -on-force events. This \"come as you are\" training is physically and mentally tough. It moves at high speed over terrain like that in Southwest Asia.... Above all else, have a good time at the NTC. It's fun. And you and your soldiers will enjoy the experience (despite the d ust bowl!). It's a challenge you want to meet head on.... Staff planning, coordination, and execution are keys to a successful rotation at NTC. But teams of soldiers win or lose battles there. -CSM Donald C. Cubbison , \"Gettin g Ready for NTC: Tips for the CSM.\" Army Trainer , Winter 1983, pp. 22, 23 Hip-Pocket Training A Serjant...ought to have a quicke spirit, and active body, able both suddainly to conceive, and painfully to execute, his superiour Officers, orders, and comm ands, it importeth much that hee bee a skilfull valiant Souldier; in regard hee is put upon weighty and dangerous services; hee ought to be very ready and skillfull, in ordering and rancking the Company, and in knowledge of exercising the same, hee ought t o take all occasions in time of peace, to call forth such squadrons as have the guard, and duly to exercise them there. - Anima'dversions of Warre , 1639, p. 196 The squad leader must be prepared to present impromptu or \"tool -box\" classes at any opportunit y.... Any time the squad leader has five minutes, he should be prepared to instruct squad members on subjects such as safety, personal hygiene, or maintenance of equipment. -CSM Johnny W. Greek , \"The Noncommissioned Officer.\" Engineer , Fall 1980, p. 33 [Combining] tasks and training to do two or more things at once...can increase productivity and readiness. When sending soldiers to perform vehicle PMCS, do you dismiss them and watch as they all scramble to the parking lot to drive separately to the motor pool? Have them instead assemble as a group, practice drill and ceremony and march to the motor pool. Upon arrival they report activity noted along the way using the SALUTE method or submit an NBC 1 report made up along the way. Perhaps they could identify land features through terrain association. A phone call to another section can be sent as a radio message for practice. - MSG Lydia R. Mead , \"Increasing Training Effectiveness in the Reserves.\" AUSA file s, 1995, no page number When you spot something that is being done wrong, or could be done better, instead of just making an \"on the spot correction\" (which is fine), go one step further and make a five- or ten -minute training situation out of the problem . -SMA William A. Connelly , \"For NCO's: TRAINING.\" Oct 1980, pp. 23- 24 Realistic Training Soldiers...know if you're really training or if you're conducting makeshift training to keep them b usy. They see and know the difference between that and realistic training.... I learn things daily from young soldiers going through training.... Realistic training stands out. Realistic training motivates soldiers and it also motivates NCOs, me, and anyon e who sees it. -CSM Henry J. Goodwin , \"TRADOC.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1989, p. 13 The best NCOs look for ways to make training as realistic as possible. They know the more challenging and worthwhile the training is, the more it w ill reflect and create cohesion among their soldiers. They put their soldiers through...experiences in which they do things they didn't believe they could do as individuals or as a unit.... Training in the way you plan to go to war brings your soldiers tog ether as a team and builds their confidence. That confidence, in turn, gives your soldiers the deep -seated belief that the unit can and will Training 6 accomplish the mission, no matter how unfavorable the odds. -CSM George D. Mock and SFC John K. D'Amato , \"Building the Force: 'Skill, Will and Teamwork.'\" NCO Journal , Summer 1991, p. 19 The whole setup [at the NTC] is a training scheme and you are expected to make some mistakes. You are also expected to learn from your mistakes because there will be no forgiveness when the steel flies in earnest. -SFC Richard Wagner , \"Lessons from the OPFOR.\" Armor , May-Jun 1984, p. 33 If you go to the NTC, you're going to find out the real truth about y our unit. -CSM Collin L. Younger , USAR CSM, \"CSMs: Future Must Stress Training, Soldier Quality.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1992, p. 10 Simulators will not, and are not intended to replace live firing. Those psychological aspects o f firing have to be experienced first-hand . Gunners have to see and feel that weapon go off, experience the smoke and noise, and watch that round go down range and hit the target. Live fire is crucial to those first round hits. And we cannot afford to give our adversaries the chance to shoot back. -SMA Glen E. Morrell , \"As the SMA Sees It.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1984, p. 24 Introduction of difficult situations is one of the chief benefits of free -play tactical exercises.... This is realism. -SFC Charles R. Souza , \"MILES Cheating: Key to Failure.\" Army Trainer , Summer 1985, p. 5 The use of simulators will certainly increase as training dollars shrink [but] we don't want simulators to take over reality. A t some point you need \"the real thing.\" - CSM Fred M. Luttrell , \"CSMs: Future Must Stress Training, Soldier Quality.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1992, p. 11 Absolute realism demands absolute honesty in training. -MSG Miles C. Pitman , \"Are We Training Soldiers to Kill Each Other?\" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, p. 11 All too often, tank identification training consists of passing out a few decks of \"Tank I.D.\" cards and putting some posters of Threat vehicles up on the walls in the arms room. Although these cards provide a good starting point, their use becomes stale quickly, usually because of the sterility of their presentation. But a section sergeant can correct this problem by making his own set of cards from pictures that he finds in various publications, such as old (and new) national news magazines or military journals. Such magazines sometimes contain full color pictures of NATO and Warsaw Pact armor in various \"poses\"- three -quarter view, half hidden by d ust or smoke, or in multiple groupings. In addition, these vehicles often show their national markings. Another valuable source of pictures is the catalogs put out by the companies that make the plastic vehicle models. Easily obtained from any hobby store , these catalogues are packed with full -color shots of T -62s, Chieftains, Leopards, and M- 60s. By cutting out a variety of pictures and taping them to index cards, the instructor can create a collection of cards that will challenge the soldiers to use all their knowledge of vehicles to identify them. At the same time, the soldiers will receive a much more realistic picture of the vehicles they are studying. [This is just one way that] realism can be added to indoor training. No doubt, there are many others that trainers themselves can devise. These suggestions are not intended to replace outdoor training but to present some alternate ways of conducting more realistic indoor classes when time or weather interfere with the training schedule. Once the initial effort has been made to gather the materials needed, these methods can be used again and again. More important, they can be set up and readied for use at any time with little advance notice. - SSG Alexander F. Barnes , \"Indoor TOW Training.\" Infantry , Jul-Aug 1983, p. 37 \"I think you can pull off any kind of training right if you use your imagination.... I'll show you,\" [said SFC Travis McWilliams .] He used one track, two quarter -ton trucks, three portable radios, and seven soldiers. The company sat on the side of a low hill overlooking about 500 meters of open land with a tree line and woods behind it. He put the track with the driver deep in the woods on the left, about 1200 meters away. He placed one quarter - ton in the woods behind a cluster of old buildings, about 1000 meters away. The driver stayed close to the truck. The other truck he located at the crossroad about 700 meters distant. It had a radio. Two other soldiers with a radio were in the woods about 700 meters distant. One soldier was in the cluster of buildings while another was on the other side of the hill we were on. He had a radio. We waited until 1900 hours and total darkness. The trainer started his introduction. \"Ladies and gentl emen, the purpose of our demonstration tonight is to show you why battlefield noise -and-light discipline is important. There are enemy soldiers and equipment all around us and we want to find out where and how many there are. They are soldiers just like yo u, except they are defending that open area just in front. During the next half hour, let's see what we can learn about them. Be very quiet and watch.\" The soldier on our hill was close enough to hear SFC McWilliams' pitch, and acted as a quarterback, qui etly telling the others what to do. The observers did not know he was there. SFC McWilliams paused. Then it started. Within a minute, we heard a cough. Amazing! The night air made it so clear we felt like we could touch the guy who did it. We pinpointed exactly where he stood in Training 7 the trees. Another three minutes wait - a tiny flame spurted nearby the building cluster. Small as it was, the light flared out clear as an auto beam. Then it disappeared behind the building, but not bef ore it silhouetted an outline of the structure. The soldier had merely lit a cigarette. That simple action gave away his location and the whole building that covered him. Quickly, another lighter flared deep in the woods. For visibility, it might as well have been in the open space since even the coal gleamed in the darkness - brighter when the soldier pulled on the cigarette. SFC McWilliams kept making points along the way. Even the troops were really getting into it. They comm ented and buzzed with each new break in ya see that?\" \"Yeah, right there.\" SFC McWilliams called for quiet again. Then at the woodline, a new light gleamed. Apparently it was a flashlight with a filter on it, like a red dot bouncing around the undergrowth. Soon, in a stage whisper clear as a snake hiss we heard, \"Schultz, you out there?\" Suddenly, with almost no pause, all engines cranked up at the same time. Then they idled. SFC McWilliams' voice broke the engine hum. \"How many vehicles are out there and what kind are they?\" He got every answer ranging from one jeep to a division of tanks. The sergeant also made his points. \"Now you see. First, don't ever believe you can hide light when it's dark. You can't. Not in the woods, not behind buildings, not anywhere. Second, during most hours of darkness you can hear almost everything that happens. Third, you can hear engine sound. But it's nearly impossible to say how many vehicles and what kind.\"... A little ima gination [can] put a lot of snap into dull training attitudes. And you don't need a whole battlefield simulation to do the job. You can do it cheaply at minimum cost with what you have. The whole company came up with a new attitude [and] began coming up wi th new ideas and new ways to do things.... Something else I learned about was thinking training. A few minutes of thought is a sure route to improving it.... Training in any situation could save a life, turn a battle, or win a war. -\"Night Show.\" Army Trainer, Winter 1986, pp. 5- 6 For our [NBC] Olympics, we built activities around tasks the soldier must do to perform his mission. We decided we should try to have some fun. We made the conditions as challenging and close to combat situations as possible. Cr eating challenging conditions was right in line for our chemical waste specialist, who had received extensive fire -fighting training. Firefighting conditions are similar in some respects to combat: ever -present danger, oppressive heat, blinding smoke, numb ing noise, poor communication, and terrifying isolation. We couldn't create real physical danger, but we provided darkness, heat, noise, and isolation in abundance. We built the games around seven stations, giving practice in...soldier's common tasks.... T he entire olympics gave a taste of operating in a real combat situation. -SFC Karl Soucie , \"NBC Training with a New Twist.\" Army Trainer , Winter 1992, pp. 21, 22 Training Standards The rapid development of modern warfare as exemp lified at present in Europe [WWI] indicates clearly that the standard soldier of this year may not meet the requirements of next year's warfare. In other words, the soldier standard may change as rapidly in our modern times as do the models of the automobi le world. -Nevertheless, there must always be a well -defined standard. -Under a system of short enlistment, intensive training, and the building of a large reserve, there must especially be a standard. -The standard must be fixed in the minds of all who instruct and direct. -Increments of untrained or partially trained officers must early be familiarized with the standard.... The stimulus of pride in the attainment of a definite standard of skill will cause most of the men to quickly qualify in that sta ndard. -A Manual of Intensive Training of the Infantry Soldier, the Infantry Non- Commissioned Officer, the Infantry Squad, 1916, pp. 8, 25 There were no shortcuts [during Desert Shield and Desert Storm]. If you take shortcuts, the troops become lax. -SFC Larry Ingram , \"Moving Beyond Victory.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1991, p. 15 You can always continue training if the training hours run out in a day. Look at it this way: Training standards aren't lowered. It has just taken more time t o train soldiers to standards. -CSM Henry J. Goodwin , \"TRADOC.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1989, p. 13 Allowance for mistakes during training must happen, but only when training failure is corrected.... This means extra time must be p lanned to retrain failures. Lack of training resources will always be a problem, but failure to train to standard can only lead to tragedies like [the fratricides] at Grafenwoehr and Desert Storm. -MSG Miles C. Pitman , \"Are We T raining Soldiers to Kill Each Other?\" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, p. 11 The only way to [bring soldiers home alive] is to train, Train, TRAIN and the only way to train is to TRAIN TO STANDARD! -SFC Lawrence Kordosky , \"OREs Just Tools of the Trade.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1995, p. 17 Historically, combat support and combat service support units only had to worry about supporting the combat arms force. Today that's not the case. Today they must be prepared to defend their own work s ites, rearming sites, refueling, re -equipping, resupply points, and that sort of thing. Not only must they be prepared to perform their primary mission; they also must be prepared to do Training 8 those things that allow them to fight and win - how to dig a foxhole; how to cover, camouflage, and conceal; how to use their weapons systems; how to lay tactical wire; and so on. -CSM L. Horvath the Peace.\" EurArmy , Mar 1990, pp. 5- 6 A lot of time, support personnel say, \"We do our wartime mission every day.\" That's not so. You've got to look at the conditions in which you're performing those missions. -CSM Bobby Butler , in \"Iron Time Training.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1989, p. 9 Once standards are met, t hey must be sustained. The only way to do that is through sustainment training. It's as important to sustain standards as it is to meet them. Sustaining and building provide the cutting edge needed in battle.... Sometimes that edge means the difference between victory and defeat, or life and death. -CSM James A. (Art) Johnson , \"Vantage Point.\" Military Intelligence , Oct -Dec 1992, p. 3 Evaluating Training During after -action reviews, don't pick apart the soldiers' every action, but concentrate on the major points, good and bad. -1SG Jeffrey J. Mellinger , \"Open Letters to Three NCOs.\" Infantry , May -Jun 1989, p. 21 AARs are one of the best learning tools we have.... AARs must be a two way c ommunication between the NCO and the soldiers. They are not lectures . -NCO Lessons Learned , Oct 1989, p. 11 It's easy to point fingers at the support assets [during NTC AARs], so I make every attempt to use examples where the platoon has direct control. These include logistics reporting, crew -level maintenance, and dissemination of paragraph IV information to the platoon. -1SG C. R. Johnson , \"Make the BOS Work for You and Your Platoon.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1995, p. 7 Don't think of [an ORE] as a pass/fail evaluation. Think of it as a learning process that will help focus your training.... Take what you learn and use it to develop and plan the next year's training. -SFC Lawrence Kordosky , \"OREs Just T ools of the Trade.\" NCO , Spring 1995, p. 18 [During after -action reviews] together we reconstruct the mission from when the operation order is given at the end of the mission. For instance, I'll say, \"Such and such a tank was killed. Why do you think that happened?\" Then someone might say, \"Well, I skylined on the hill and got shot,\" or \"There wasn't a proper base of fire before I moved.\" This way the soldiers - especially the leaders - learn exactly what happened, why, and what to do so it won't happen in the next battle, whether it's here or in real combat.... We are not graders. We don't give [soldiers] a go or no-go, and we don't say they are combat -ready or not. We evaluate them as a unit in a combat environment and give them the opportunity to train, learn, and become the kind of unit that can survive.... If you plotted on a graph the learning curve of the units while they are here, it would be almost a vertical climb until about mid - rotation, and then it would start to level out. By the end of rotation, it has leveled out but at a much higher leve l than when they arrived. -SFC Miles C. Pitman , in \"NTC: The Eyes of the Battle.\" Soldiers , Feb 1984, pp. 25, 24 The Basics and Building on the Basics What we try to empha size at the soldier level, and what has made the brigade successful, are the basics. We are constantly drilling them with simple things like maintenance, occupying fighting positions, and engaging targets. Most of the time, what allows either side to win b attles [at the NTC] is their opponents' lack of attention to those basics: not zeroing weapons, not analyzing and using the terrain, becoming fatigued and careless. -CSM Glendon Baker , in \"NTC's Bad Guys.\" Soldiers , Oct 1993, p. 14 The basic difference between a well -trained unit and one that is not well- trained is found in the attention paid to fundamentals of tactics, marksmanship, communications, camouflage, maintenance, administration, and all the other arts and skills that contribute to making a unit combat -ready. -DA Pam 350-13, Guide for Platoon Sergeants , 1967, p. 18 No football coach sends his team out to scrimmage on the first day of practice. He would end up with chaos and a lot of injuries. Instead, he drills the play ers on individual skills like blocking, tackling, and passing. Then he works on collective tasks such as setting up the pocket and pass -release timing. When the players are trained to proficiency in these skills, the coach has them work on plays. -SSG Ric o Johnston, \"Battle Drills.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1981, p. 14 NCOs can weld their soldiers together through tough, realistic battle drills. Battle drills will provide training necessary to develop strong bonds and confidence between soldiers and leaders. Battle drills reflect the Army's commitment to professional excellence and the warrior spirit. -NCOPD Study , Vol 2, 1986, p. J -6 If we do not maintain our focus on the basics during these times of a seemingly endless spiral of prog rams and thrusts, we could easily get lost in the curlicues of some marginal program or theme. -CSM Marcelino Malavet , \"Regimental Command Sergeant Major.\" Military Police , Jan 1994, p. 3 Training 9 The best way to build soldier confide nce is through training that allows soldiers to take on tough challenges and to succeed. -MSG John McLennon, \"How Do You Set Their Souls on Fire?\" NCO Journal , Fall 1991, p. 13 The basis for success is sustained efforts in painstaking practice of the elements of the task. -CSM Matthew Lee , \"Bridge the Gap.\" Engineer , Mar 1988, p. 3 The system of instruction crafted by [MG Frederick von] Steuben at Valley Forge was published in early 1779 under the title Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States, Part I .... It broke down the elements needed for combat success into individual tasks, each of which built upon mastery of preceding tasks. One of t he simplest systems devised anywhere in the world, it was quickly absorbed by the soldiers. To speed that process along, Steuben displayed a genius at practical psychology. He assembled a \"company of instruction\" built aroun d Washington's bodyguard and personally drilled it, encouraging all off - duty personnel to watch. Punctuated by a colorful array of epithets and jokes in several languages, his method of teaching made training enjoyable and challeng ed each soldier to excel. Members of the company then returned to their original units where, under the watchful eye of a select group of officers, they extended the system to the rest of the Army. -The Story of the Noncommissioned Officer Corps , p. 42 [N ote]: The troops appreciated what Steuben was doing for them despite (or perhaps because of) the original quality of his invective: \"Sacre! Goddam de gaucheries of dese badauts! Je ne puis plus, I can curse dem no more!\" -The Army of Frederick the Great , p. 211 Squad Level Training We will continue to have a great Army only as we continue to produce superb small units.

The rifle squad leader...commands the smallest fighting unit in the Army and the chance of combat may find him a private or a sergeant...but his skill and fortitude are the certainties upon which depend the fortunes of war.... The rifle squad leader - backbone of the battlefield - is part-time engineer, artilleryman, communicator, medic, and counselor - but he is always a leader. -\"Combat Leader: The Rifle Squad Leader - Backbone of the Battlefield.\" Infantry , Feb -Mar 1960, p. 40 Squad -level training is the most important deterrence we have against superior numbers. -CSM Frank B. Gibert , \"What You Can Do - Right Now - To Impro ve Unit Preparedness.\" Engineer , No. 1, 1987, p. 3 The most brilliant plan devised by the most capable general depends for its tactical execution on the section - leaders. Poor section -leaders may ruin the best -laid plans; first- rate section -leaders will of ten save badly devised plans. This for one simple reason: the section - leader is the sole level of command that maintains constant and direct contact with the men who bear the brunt of the actual fighting. It follows, then, that the section -leader is to be trained as a tactical commander and as an educator of his men. -GEN Yigal Allon , The Making of Israel's Army , 1970, p. 265 Each serjeant and corporal will be in a particular manner answerable for the squad committed to his care. He must pay particular attention to their conduct in every respect; that they keep themselves and their arms always clean; that they have their effects always ready, and put where they can get them immediately, even in the dark, without confusion; and on eve ry fine day he must oblige them to air their effects. -MG Frederick von Steuben , Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States , 1779, p. 148 Train and support your squad leaders. You already know from experience that their job is the toughest. They cannot do this job effectively if you don't give them all the support, assets, and quality training time that they need to do it. -1SG Jeffrey J. Mellinger , \"Open Letters to Three NCOs.\" Infantry , May -Jun 1989, p. 20 The young squad leader must also be the most inquisitive soldier of the squad, always asking questions about situations, tactics, and strategy that may not be covered in operations orders. Squad leaders m ust know the tactical situations. The only way they can properly prepare their squads is to ask the question not covered in the briefings. If leaders don't have the answers, then they should find and pass the information on so that the squad is fully infor med and able to respond to what could be the unknown. The squad leader must be willing to learn from the experience at the training center. Squads and crews are going to be thoroughly stressed, and results from evaluations may not always be to the leader' s liking. The leader may be placed in a situation where resources are limited. That is when leaders must be able to perform by making the most of what is available. This is where the young NCO becomes a true leader. -CSM James C. McKinney , CSM Lyle C.

In the field, or wherever there is good reas on, we do not care for rust on a bit, sweat marks on saddlery, or bacon grease on clothing, and the forms of military courtesy are relaxed; but we know that every man understands that this is a concession to necessity. We are for the time being savages str uggling with nature, with her cold or heat, her hunger or thirst, her fatigue, or only the loneliness of her wilderness. If we know that our men have learned how a bit and saddle should be kept; if we know that military deference and spirit is there, then we are willing to dispense with the evidence, and the training of the recruit should be such as to leave us in no doubt on these points. Recruits of troops at the same post are often consolidated for drill under non - commissioned officers specially detailed , and this method is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough. -1LT Frederick S.

Frederick von Steuben , the Army's first trainer and himself a product of the old Prussian tradition, quickly came to understand that it would take more than threats to get American recruits to perform well on the battlefield.... Citizen -soldiers would have to be led by inspiration and disciplined by reason. Of the roles performed by NCOs - small unit leader, trainer, and disciplinarian - the last has been the least affected by technological or social change. Small unit leaders have worked with tactics that have changed after almost every war. Trainers have taught the use of ever more sophisticated equipment, from the flintlock rifle to electronic communications. But when NCOs teach discipline today, they pass along to their soldiers the same idea that Steuben taught at Valley Forge. -Time - Honored Professionals , 1989, no page number Lack of discipline in an individual creates distru st and lack of confidence, and endangers you and your fellow soldiers when the chips are down.

Soldiers can be the best marksmen in the world, but their weapons won't fire unless some sergeant has instilled in them the discipline to clean their weapons - in the dark, the rain, and the freezing cold. They can have superior firepower over the enemy, but if they haven't the discipline to get up and fire their weapons - putting rounds down range on the enemy, then that firepower means nothing. They might be the \"tightest\" te am in the division, but if some sergeant hasn't instilled in them the discipline to keep themselves at the peak of their physical conditioning, the stress and fatigue of constant combat will cripple the unit's combat effectiveness and render the team useless. The name of the game is \"survival of the fittest,\" and it's a sergeant's job to make sure his or her people are the \"fittest\" - physically, mentally, and emotionally.... What the NCO works toward is not a group of soldiers who achieve and maintain standards because the sergeant is there standing over them. What the NCO wants is a group who knows that those standards are right for that team, and embraces those standards as its own.... The soldier doesn't clean his or her weapon to avoid a chewing out. T he weapon gets cleaned because that's the right thing to do. The soldier doesn't make a decision out of fear of reprimand, but because his or her values, attitudes, and beliefs confirm that it's the right decision to make. That's self -discipline and it's the only kind of discipline that will stand up to the stress, chaos, and uncertainty of battle. -CSM George D. Mock and SFC John K.

Being in good ph ysical condition prepares your body to handle stress. The healthier you are the easier it is to shake off the harmful effects of stress. [In coping] with stress it may help to ask yourself: What is the worst thing that could happen? What advice would you give to a friend in a similar position? Five years from now, how will I remember this?... The three elements to a healthy life style are: good dietary habits (low -fat diet), adequate amount of sleep (6 -8 hours), and physical training (three times per week). People who practice these habits experience a higher level of endurance and increased energy. To be effective, exercise must be aerobic. Aerobic exercise involves a sustained activity that stimulates your heart and lungs. Prolonged aerobic exercise also r elaxes the body. Many long distance runners say they experience a runner's high, which is actually the body's release of stress- reducing chemicals in your body. -MSG Bruce W.

The best commanders I've seen do exactly that. In some instances, junior leaders had to write letters to the parents of \"killed\" subordinates explaining the circumstances of \"friendly fire.\" Once, a CG ordered a 15-6 investig ation performed when an OH -58D was \"shot\" down during training by a \"friendly\" M1 tank. The individual didn't have to pay for the aircraft or account for the lives of the two flight crew members, but Soldier Skills 14 the impact was immediate and obvious. Within hours, every soldier heard of the action, and suddenly it was no longer \"cool\" to shoot down anything that flew....

A2253 UXO [unexploded ordnance] is not dead, it is just dormant. It lies waiting for the right circumstances to release its destructive force on the unwary. Far too often, that is the soldier who is just kicking around, bored or maybe looking for souvenirs. It is difficult to believe there were more casualties attributed to mishandling of ordnance than to combat during and after Operation Desert Storm. But, it's true. And the figures on ordnance -related injuries have not stopped increasing. They will not either, until every soldier knows the danger of and gains a healthy respect for UXO. -SFC Steven I. McElroy and SFC Durred \"Unexploded Ordnance Training Saves , Aug 1992, p. 16 UXO is ordna nce, such as artillery and mortar shells, bombs dropped from aircraft, missiles and rockets, and land mines, that fails to function for some reason.

He is a member necessary enough. -Military Essayes of the Ancient Grecian, Roman, and Modern Art of War , 1671, p. 220 The chain of command...is r esponsible for the cleanliness, lubrication, and functioning of the weapon as it is turned into the arms room...not the armorer. The soldier's weapon should be checked by his immediate leader, and by whoever else in the chain (platoon sergeant, platoon leader, etc.) the unit leaders or the unit SOP require. When any member of the chain has pronounced the weapon as ready for turn -in, the armorer must accept it. (The armorer has no business inspecting it for anything but the correct serial number when he accepts it. It is an abdication of responsibility and a serious blow to the reputation of the chain of command when a SP4 armorer has the authority to overrule the squad leader or platoon sergeant on such a basic question as the cleanliness of an individual we apon! On the battlefield, the armorer will not be there to provide technical advice on cleanliness and basic functioning.)... The armorer can check weapons which are in the arms room if the commander wants him to do so. A spot check or even a 100 percent check for cleanliness and functioning by the armorer or somebody else in the unit is a good idea. The company commander should use the results to see how the chain of command is working. - LTG Walter F. Ulmer , \"Forging the Chain.\" Armor , Jan - Feb 1985, pp. 30- 31 Maintenance Some of [ordnance's] highly specialized repair companies are made up largely of men who were craftsmen in the same line in civil life....

If you think maps are worthless, you haven't learned their language. Maps are keepers of the faith for soldiers who know how to read them. They tell you what's on the other side of the hill...where the enemy is likely to hide...how steep the slope is...whether there is a short cut...where the next drop zone will be...where to stash a food cache, look for water, or plan a rest stop. In Vietnam when my reconnaissance team went out, the first thing we asked for was a map. When I was chased, I'd throw everything away except my map, my compass, and my weapons. If the pursuit continued, I'd shed the weapons; but I never gave up my map or the compass around my neck. They were the keys to coming out of the jungle. [A map is an essential] piece of your equipment. [When] the terrain is of immediate interest...it's the most important piece of paper in the world.... Without a map to negotiate terrain, you are quite simply and literally lost. That was never clearer to me than while I was at a Chinese rough terrain school in Taiwan - rough terrain meaning you must air drop into any terrain and do your job. In the haste to deploy, the American members of the party jumped without a map. We landed in a rugged area- two men shattered t heir legs- and we hadn't a ghost of an idea where we were. We had radios, but without a map how could we tell the rescue party where to find us? Some of us struggled our way to a road. But which road? Where did it go? An operation that should have taken 4 hours took 15 while the injured soldiers, one caught in a tree, waited - all for want of a map. A simple piece of paper was the vital missing link. -CSM Matthew Lee , \"Bridge the Gap.\" Engineer , Fall -Winter 1986, p. 3 Patrolling The Scoute maister every evening [must direct a sufficient number of scouts] into crosse wayes and other places of perrill in everie quarter of the Campe, he must exhorte them still to silence, and to have regard to looke about them, and not to forsake theyr places appointed, till discoverers be put forth in the morning to the fielde. -A Path -Way to Military Practise , 1587, no page number A strong patrole has certainly the power of resisting better than a small one, but if the country is known, the advantag e is on the side of the small patroles, as they may pass with more ease, and have a better chance to approach near the enemy without being discovered.... The patrole must march in the greatest silence- every body should be attentive - no talking allowed - no tobacco should be smoked, and every thing must be tight on the body, that no rattling may be heard.... Although the greatest silence is recommended to the patroles at night, the non -commissioned officer making a patrole by day should keep up a conversati on with his men, when in an open country, upon the nature of the grounds they are passing through; instruct them in what manner to conduct themselves if on a patrole at night; what conspicuous places there are in the vicinity to retreat to, or go by at nig ht; shew to the men the points of north, south, east, and west; the probable situation of the enemy, and the situation of our own army. So as to be able to approach the one undiscovered at night, or to retreat in a safe manner if attacked by a superior for ce; this should be the only subject of conversation with his men. Reports must be made in the clearest manner; the men should not be in a hurry when making the same, as by that means the danger is over -rated. The report may be such as the following, viz. Enemy's hussars or cavalry are seen at the distance of 800 or 1000 paces; behind them is observed the glittering of bayonets, and at a greater distance a cloud of dust is seen.... It has happened frequently that a hedge has been taken for a line of troops, a drove of cattle or sheep for a body of men, carts for cannons, therefore great attention must be paid to prevent mistakes and consequently a false alarm. Q. 76. Is the countersign in the field the same as in time of peace, being one word? A. The countersign in an army is generally the name of a place or of a man; but in the very advanced post an additional countersign is used to know the patroles. Sometimes a number or a low cough which is repeated two or three times, or some knock upon the rifle or fir elock or cartridge box, which are recollected much better by the centinels, than foreign names they are not accustomed to. Soldier Skills 16 Q.9. How is the patrole to act on meeting travellers? A. They must be examined as any other person; should they go the same road the patrole is going, they must be kept back, and told in a civil manner that they cannot proceed; should they make the plea of a passport and get saucy, they are to be told that they must not go on, and two men left to guard them for sometime (or should the patrole intend to return by the same road, until it returns); they may be permitted to enter into a house, if any is near, but kept under the guard of the two men.... Q.12. In what manner is the truth to be obtained from the country people upon the inform ation that the enemy has occupied their village or place of habitation? A. The truth must be obtained by good words, or by threatening, if necessary. -Hints for Non -Commissioned Officers on Actual Service , 1804, pp. 51, 49, 67, 12- 13, 31, 24, 54, 55 Thor ough preparation is the only way of assuring that the results a patrol gets are worth the risk and effort its members accept. And it is the best possible insurance against patrol casualties. -MSG Jim Connell, \"Bringing in the Dope.\" Infantry , Jan 1946, p. 42 [While patrolling, noncommissioned officers] must not suffer their men to make the least noise with their arms or accoutrements, and every now and then stop and listen. -MG Frederick von Steuben , Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States , 1779, p. 150 Every normal person fears the dark, but if you have to face it there is great reassurance to moving quietly in good company, travelling light and knowing that you have been well trained in the basics - take your time, don't lose contact, when in doubt sink down and listen, and try to remember that darkness is a friend. -George MacDonald Fraser (former Lance -CPL), WWII, Quartered Safe Ou t Here , p. 61 No war will ever come that will not place upon the Non - commissioned Officers of Cavalry troops enormous personal responsibility.... The Non -commissioned officer will be required repeatedly to command patrols - small patrols (and sometimes str ong ones) - upon the most hazardous reconnaissances, and he must know not only the cardinal principles of cavalry life as regards husbanding the strength of both men and horses but he will be required to conduct his patrol skillfully while out, guard it aga inst surprise, insure its progress in the right direction (day or night), and gain that information which he is sent out to obtain. -Manual of Instruction of the Non- Commissioned Officers of a Troop of Cavalry in Security and Information, 1903, pp. 7- 8 Those whose job it is to pull triggers in war will tell you theirs is a dangerous business. Believe it! Those whose job it is to collect intelligence about the enemy without being detected, will tell you theirs is more dangerous. Then, there is the essence of danger...the scout.... Cavalry scouts were used in the Americas as early as the 1750s, when the British were fighting the French. A colonial American, Robert Rogers , raised a company of rangers and used scouts to gather information in order to carry out his raids against the French. In that day and age, it wasn't called \"going on a recon;\" it was called, \"going on a scout.\" It is important to note that Rogers learned most of his scouting skills from Native Americ ans, many of whom served with him. It is believed those skills created the foundation for the scout's mission throughout U.S. Army history. -CSM Ronnie W. Davis , \"The Cavalry Scout.\" Armor , Sep -Oct 1995, p. 5 The tactical walk is one of the very few military instruction methods that can be conducted effectively without preparation. A competent and imaginative instructor can begin a tactical walk on the spur of the moment - anywhere. All he needs to do is scan the terrain, visualize a tactical situation, announce it to the class, and ask: \"Now, what would you do if -?\" Immediately every member of the class is compelled to think on his feet - to study actual terrain, make a hasty estimate of the situation, arrive at a decision, and describe his actions and orders. -SFC Forrest K. Kleinman , \"Take a Tactical Walk!\" ARMY , Mar 1957, p. 60 The habit of continually studying terrain...cannot be stressed too highly. -MSG James F. Quinn , \"Evasion and Escape.\" Infantry , Apr 1957, p. 69 There are many ways to train successfully without a great deal of bucks.... Look at another form of terrain walks. Develop a scenario over a specific piece of terrain, an example is the GDP mission. Take the soldiers of a platoon or company to the forward edge of the scenario, or where you expect the attack to occur. Recon the map (ensure each NCO has a map) and the ground to select good defensive positions and control points. Share those decisions with th e organization. Now walk the battle areas from the standpoint of the enemy. Walk by crews, discussing advantages and disadvantages along the way. Ensure that platoon groups come together every 50 -to-100 meters or so and discuss tactical engagements, positi ons, fields of fire, avenues of approach, boundaries, fire plan, etc.... A good GDP scenario recon takes about five days, but the training and esprit developed in those five days cannot be replaced. -CSM John M. Stephens , \"Trai ning the Reduced Budget Way.\" Armor , Mar -Apr 1988, p. 7 Soldier Skills 17 Intelligence and Security Use common sense in security matters and you will never find your flanks exposed. -SGM Dan Cragg , \"To Noncoms on the Staff: Stay Loose; Keep in Shape .\" ARMY , Jan 1980, p. 51 When...great occasions are offered, where it is needefull to carry the souldiers with great silence, secrecie, and stilnesse [the Sergeant Major] is to Practike of Moderne Warres , 1598, p. 110 It happens frequently that the enemy sends an officer with a trumpeter, and an officer with a flag in a boat.... The centinels must be cautioned not to enter into any kind of conversation with them, as it is probable that every means will be used to pump th e centinel. -Hints for Non -Commissioned Officers on Actual Service , 1804, p. 27, 28 [During the Civil War, SGT John D. Colvin was stationed at Fort Strong, on Morris Island, and by persevering he learned the enemy's flag signal codes. Later], stationed at a prominent point, his duty called for the interpretation of the messages of the enemy constantly flying from post to post. Through this arrangement, the intentions of the enemy, the commands of their general, the movements of t he troops, and various other valuable information was submitted to the general commanding. As an evidence of the value of the gleanings of this station, it is only necessary to give a specimen message intercepted: July 9th, 6.30 P.M. GEN. [FELIX H.] ROBER TSON : Your two telegrams of 1 o'clock to- day received. Do not attack, but take a strong position, and do your utmost to prevent the enemy from advancing. Their object is to establish batteries in position to enfilade our works on James Island. Your especial duty now is to prevent them from doing that. If you accomplish that, it is all that I can expect at present. Take care of your men; that is, do not hurl them rashly against the enemy. Put them in a good position to keep the enemy back. If this is an intended general advance, your attack this morning will make them pause. [signed] GEN. [SAMUEL] JONES . -The Signal Corps, U.S.A. in the War of the Rebellion , pp. 279- 281 The [S2] section must train be fore departing their home station [for the NTC]; studying Soviet/OPFOR tactics, performing map reconnaissance of Fort Irwin, remembering that the map is part of an underdeveloped picture...and coordinating with the S3, to become familiar with his particula rs. The staff must practice the intelligence cycle and build a trust between the S2 and the intelligence section. Once at the National Training Center, the S2 must attempt to make a ground reconnaissance of the area, keeping in mind that what is on the ma p may be different from what is on the ground. He must also coordinate with the S3 and company commanders on the use of counter -reconnaissance. This is vital; denying the OPFOR the use of their eyes and ears on the battlefield will also deny them the infor mation they need to win. All the reference material that can be taken, should be taken. All reports from both lower and higher elements must be checked. Don't take for granted that someone else has. Many times \"higher headquarters\" will report items on the battlefield which are not relevant to the situation.... The S2 must, in conjunction with the S3 and the companies, coordinate all combat patrols. This involves planning, rehearsals, inspections, briefings, monitoring, and debriefing all patrol members. T he S2 who is not involved often misses information important to develop recommended priority intelligence requirements for the commander. Patrol members may miss important information on the battlefield when not informed of what to look for. All patrols, n ot just reconnaissance patrols, have the mission of gathering intelligence information.... S2s must pace themselves; it is impossible to stay awake to complete rotation.

Hee ought to be of a singular good cariage, and discreet, to observe and take notice of all passages, that may give any intelligence to his Officers of the state of the Enemie; Hee must be very wary that nothing be screwd from him, neither by faire nor foule meanes; wherefore he must b e wary of the Enemies friendship, in bestowing courtesies upon him especially in giving him drinke, least in his cupps he reveale of Warre pp. 194- 195 If such Drums or Phifes fortune to fall into the handes of the ene mie, no gyfte, no faire speeches, neither force nor terror, shall cause them to betray any secrets knowne to them. -The Approved Order of Martiall Discipline , 1591, p. 17 Let the Sergeant Major be very carefull to provide good drummers, and men skilfull in their art, especially their Drumme Majors; for the drumme is the voice of the commander in the field: and besides their skill with the drumme, to be men of good capacity and judgement; also to speak sundry languages, being behouvefull for many important occasions wherein they are to be employed. -The Theorike and Practike of Moderne Warres, 1598, p. 115 Soldier Skills 18 Guard Duty Much depends on the care and attention with which [noncommissioned officers] instruct the sentinels in their duty and their capacity for mak ing them comprehend the orders. They should be particularly careful in cautioning the sentinels not to give unnecessary alarm, and never to fire until they feel assured of what they are firing at, and that there is some probability of their shots being eff ective. Many an innocent person has been killed by the sentinel, in his trepidation, neglecting or forgetting to challenge, and firing without first ascertaining whether it was friend or foe who was approaching. Many false alarms have been produced, and se rious consequences have resulted, from firing unnecessarily, sometimes at friends accidentally in the way, or at officers visiting the posts, sometimes at hogs, cattle, or other animals, and frequently at nothing at all. Many of these accidents can be prev ented by the judgment, coolness, and alertness of the non- commissioned officers. -Customs of Service for Non - Commissioned Officers and Soldiers , 1865, p. 126 Being appointed to ward or watch, let [the Sentinel] be first refreshed with victuals.... The Se rgeant Major is to bee carefull, to visite every day the Corps de guards. - Theorike and Practike of Moderne Warres , 1598, pp. 16, 114 After the establishment of [guards of a corporal and three privates], few instances occurred of whole troops of nois y mules, horses, and asses, chasing each other round and through the camp or bivouac, and galloping over the faces and bodies of the soldiers whilst they were asleep. -Advanced -Guard, Out -Post, and Detachment Service of Troops , 1863, p. 128 The hardships of a soldier's life are half in imagination. If you must stand picket with the rain and snow freezing on you, thinking of your misery don't help it. -CPL Frederick Pettit, Civil War, Infantryman Pettit, p. 110 So soone as the Sentinell shall call upon any approach, he shall immediately goe with his Sword drawne, or in especiall cases (where the Enemy lodgeth neare) with a guard of two at least (being a Pike and a Shot) unto the Sentinell, and making his Guard stand upon their guard, he shall place the point of his sword to the breast of him that is to give the Word, whether he be Rounder, or other private passenger, and so with his eare to his mouth very closely receive the Word , which if it be right, he shall give the partie p asse, if otherwise, he shall take him prisoner and disarme him, and either keepe him upon his guard, or els deliver him to his superior Officer. -The Souldiers Exercise. In Three Bookes , 1639, p. 7 [The purpose of an advanced guard is] to take care that the enemy does not fall upon us unawares, and that the main body may have time to get ready to receive the enemy and to put itself in the best situation for defence.... A non -commissioned officer who has the command of [the advanced posts] is under a very great responsibility, as by his negligence thousands of his comrades may lose their lives or liberty. Q.8. In what manner is an advanced post or picket to be placed in front of a village? A. In the gardens, behind the hedges, on both sides of the roads by which the enemy must advance, the road is to be closed up with waggons placed across it, and of which the wheels towards the post are taken off; ploughs, harrows, etc. may be put likewise upon the road, by which the enemy will be retarded in his advance, and an opportunity will be given to annoy him much by the cross fire from both sides of the road.... Q. 10. In what manner, and at what distance are the centinels to be placed? A. About three hundred paces, and they should be placed in such a manner, if possible, as to be hid, but that they nevertheless can see at a great distance, so that no cavalry of the enemy can dash upon them and cut them down, or make them prisoners.... Q. 39. What is a centinel to do in heavy rain, high wind, or a storm of snow? A. He should front towards the enemy, he must not draw his hat over his eyes, nor stoop with his head to screen himself from the wind or snow storm, but should redouble his attention to observe what is going on, for in stormy or bad weather a surprise is o ften executed, as the enemy confides in the inattention of the centinels, who frequently are of opinion that in such bad weather the enemy will not attempt any thing, whereas it is the most eligible and favourable opportunity for him to attempt a surprise. ... Q. 83. Are the centinels allowed to smoke? A. No; as by night the fire in a pipe may be seen at a great distance, even the smoke of the tobacco may be smelt.... Q. 79. Are the advanced guards to turn out by day under arms; general officers visiting t he same? A. By no means; - every body remains quiet; the officer or non - commissioned officer meets him and receives his commands... Q. 72. What is to be the conduct of the centinels when a field officer or a general visits the post? A. In the same manner, as with the patrole, he demands the countersign, and does not suffer any one to come near him. -Hints for Non-Commissioned Officers on Actual Service , 1804, pp. 29, 1, 3- 4, 12, 26, 25, 23 [Enter a SERGEANT of a band, with two SENTINELS].

Sunstroke may be prevented by wearing a silk handkerchief in the crown of the hat, by a wet cloth, or by moistened green leaves or grass. - Customs of Service for Non -Commissioned Officers and Soldiers , 1865, p. 249 To Make a Fire without Matches. Take a dry handkerchief or cotton lining of your coat, scrape out a very fine lint [and] by using the crystal of your watch, compa ss or spectacle, a sun glass can be made that will ignite the lint, which can be blown to fire. Another way. Sprinkle powder of cartridge as a fuse to the cotton lint, and with the cartridge percussion cap you can easily ignite the lint, dry moss, leaves, etc. Still another way. Take scrapings of very fine pine wood, find a piece of quartz or hard ragged rock, by using your knife or bayonet as a steel you have a practical flint and steel. If you haven't these things, use two pieces of rough, jagged stone and by striking them together sharply in slanting blows you can ignite the lint or scrapings. -Noncommissioned Officers' Manual , 1917, p. 299 Taking Care of Your Feet [Tips on feet care]: Dirty feet invite blisters....

Keep the body rested by plenty of sleep. Do not join idle parties going to walk the streets of the nearest town at nights, nor sit up late playing cards, nor wander in native towns after dark. -Noncommissioned Officers' Manual , 1917, p. 203 I am the tiredest man that ever lived. -SGT Hamlin Coe, Civil War, Mine Eyes Have Seen t he Glory , p. 133 Always prepare your bed before dark. Level off the ground and scrape out a little hollow for your hips. Get some straw or dry grass if possible. Green grass or branches from trees are better than nothing. Sleep on your poncho. This keeps the dampness from coming up from the ground and chilling the body. Every minute spent in making a good bed means about an hour's good rest later on. -Manual for Noncommissioned Officers and Privates of Infantry of the Army of the United States , 1917, p. 45 Self-Help for Maintaining Roads [Tips for soldiers for self -help on road maintenance]: The primary requirement of wet -weather road maintenance is keep the road dry . If you have a shovel and a little spare time, you can go in for ditching and draining in a big way. If you haven't, get a stick. A good stick and the heel of a boot will do a lot for a road. If you see a rut full of water, kick a hole in the low side and let it drain off. Or if you see a hatful of debris jamming a culvert, get your stick an d pry it out of the way. If a ditch is flooded, punch a run -off for it.... It doesn't sound like much but in a spirit of pure science I tried it over a couple of hundred yards of road that I had to traverse to get chow. Three times a day for a week I did w hat I could with a stick and my shoes to keep that stretch of road from inundation. At the end of the week it wasn't good, exactly, but it was a hell of a lot better than the soupy stream that started where my amateur drainage project left off. The second procedure is no harder. If you see a hole starting in a road, kick a rock or some gravel into it. Little holes automatically grow into big ones. When a truck slams down into a little hole, the springs snap it back up again, and in the natural course of ev ents the whole weight of load and chassis pounds down on the road again a few inches farther on. On a heavily travelled road, it's only a matter of days before a pretty fair road becomes a washboard. Obviously, the thing to do is to stop the first bounce - and that's exactly what you do when you kick a rock into the beginning of the trouble.... The other part of the program applies to drivers. The cardinal rule for everyone [is to] drive on the ridges, not in the ruts. You can't always do it. Occasionally, sluggish driving on the part of your predecessors will hack the ruts deep enough to make the heights dangerous. But if everybody stays on the ridges, you'll have a flat, compact roadbed instead of a hog wallow.... Finally, use your eyes and your head to k eep from aggravating flaws already in the road. Keep as near the center line as possible. The edges of a road are its most vulnerable parts. They crumble easily under a load and the break begins to gnaw its way across the whole roadbed until you have a sem itank trap and a mile or two of traffic backed up waiting to cross it at two miles per hour.... So- regardless of theater, season, or MOS - if you, personally, will do what you can to keep the roads dry; keep the holes filled; keep the roads flat; and avoi d making the roads worse, the supply problem will be cut in half, at least. You'll be making the war easier for everyone involved, and maybe a little shorter for yourself. -MSG Jim Connell, \"Dig, Drain, Ditch.\" Note: What MSG Connell ...learned in WWII is still applicable today. - COL Randall Inouye , CDR, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, letter 16 Feb 1997 Risk Assessment Using the ris k assessment card stacks the deck in your favor when it comes to force protection. You play with a full deck and \"know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em,\" when it comes to mission accomplishment. You also receive powerful payoffs in the form of lives saved, increased efficiency, effectiveness, and readiness. It all adds up to a winning hand. -Jim Collins , \"Force Protection - It's in the Cards.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, p. 9 The best tool commanders and NCOs can have [in any operatio n] is risk assessment. Assessing risks...can be as small an issue as simply asking, \"How can my soldiers get hurt, and what can I do about it?\" Asking that one question and getting an answer, and applying the risk assessment principles - risk analysis and hazard control - may save a soldier's life.... NCOs need to ask three key questions to raise [safety] awareness. These are: Who will have the next accident in my unit? What kind of accident will it be? What am I doing about it? - SGM Samuel Reynolds , \"Force Protection.\" FORMula.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, pp. 13, 14 The impact [of using the risk assessment card] really becomes significant when the process gets passed down to the squad level.... In my unit t he accident rate dropped at least 50 percent when we began using the Field Training 22 risk assessment card. -SGM Jim Wertman , in \"Force Protection - It's in the Cards.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, p. 9 The Army's number one peacetime enemy is one that soldiers face every day on every street, road, and highway.... This is a war fought not with bullets but with your privately owned vehicle (POV). This war has casualties that result from recklessness, alcohol, speed, and a lack of safety belt use.... The advantage of surprise is always on the enemy's side. Don't expect it to wait until you're out of town; 70 percent of accidents happen within 25 miles of home.... The Army requires soldiers to use their protective gear in this battle, as in any battle. You wouldn't consider going to war without your weapon, mask, and helmet, would you? So why do people still insist on fighting this unseen enemy without the equipment provided? Just the use of a safety belt increases your chance of surviving an accident by 80 percent. Safety belts allow a ride -down advantage for the wearer since the vehicle absorbs most of the impact of the crash. Safety belts also prevent deadly secondary collisions in which the occupants of the vehicle are thrown forward, striking the car's interior. During evasive maneuvering the safety belt helps restrain the driver so that he may maintain control of the vehicle and possibly avoid a crash.... If you don't want to think about dying, think about this. POV accidents are also the leading cause of paraplegia, quadriplegia, and severe head injuries.... Good soldiers know their enemy. Study its tactics. Develop defensive strategies. Then use them. -SFC William F. Hall, \"The Unseen Enemy.\" Ordnance , Aug 1991, p. 43 Training Safety It saddens and angers me to read about young soldiers dying needlessly due to accidents that so easily could be prevented.... Analyze every situation within your area of operations. Inspect your soldiers' work area, observe their actions and imagine the worst possible scenario. Chances are that if you can imagine a situation that might result in an accident, it will eventually happen. Then do something to correct the situation. Hammer safety consciousness into your soldiers every opportunity y ou get. Develop within them a sensitivity to safety hazards.... Create a safety - conscious climate in which every one of your soldiers becomes a safety inspector. -CSM Joshua Perry , \"Regimental Command Sergeant Major.\" Military Police , Nov 1989, p. 3 Generally, there are two major causes of accidents involving new soldiers - lack of training and over - anxiety (the desire to make a good impression). Initial safety briefings along with continuous follow through and training, can help el iminate both problems. Emphasizing the \"why\" aspect of rules results in a more cooperative attitude. Soldiers are more inclined to follow the rules when the need is more clearly understood.... NCOs must be able to identify the accident -prone soldier - the o ne who's tired, stressed out, sick, untrained, etc. This soldier is like a truck with bad brakes. -SFC Todd E. Duncan, \"Supervisors and Safety.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, p. 7 Who has the most influence on safety in your unit? T he safety officer? The commander? No. You do! You, the noncommissioned officer, have the single greatest chance to make safety happen in your unit.... Keep in mind that the costly shortcuts and failures to follow procedures are most likely to happen when y ou are not there, so make it a habit to be there. Be there. Watch. Ask questions. And don't be there only in fair weather; it's more likely the faults are going to occur when the weather is cold, wet, and miserable. If your troops are out working in those conditions, get out there with them. Do what you can to improve the conditions, but, above all, make your soldiers do the job safely. -SMA Glen E.

Mead , \"The Safety Sixth Sense.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, p. 6 The first -line leader is the key to a successful safety program because he's the leader closest to the hands -on action and enforces the safety standards.... Human error causes about 80 percent of our accidents. Soldiers make mistakes that lead to injury or death for many reasons, but the most common reason for human- error accidents is lack of discipline. Too many times, soldiers choose not to follow rules, regulations, standards, or laws. When a leader accepts below - standard performance, he lowers the standard. Simultaneously, when a leader doesn't enfor ce established standards, the likelihood of an accident's occurring increases. -CSM James C. McKinney , \"First - Line Leaders and Safety Standards.\" Field Artillery , Dec 1993, p. 5 * 23 Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit Teamwork Crews, not individuals, fight tanks, and the crews must train together, know each other's strengths and weaknesses, know their machines. When it works, it is magnificent and irresistible. -CSM Richard L. Ross, \"As We Face the Fu ture the Glass Is Half Full.\" Armor , May - Jun 1992, p. 5 One requisite necessary to win the battle is intelligent team work.... The one question that always presents itself on the battle field every minute of the time to every person, whether he be a gener al or a private, is \"What play has my team captain ordered, and how best may I act so as to work in conjunction with the other players to bring about the desired result?\"... A poor play in which every player enters with his whole heart (team work) will often win, while, on the other hand, the best play in which some of the players are skulkers and shirkers will probably fail. -Manual for Noncommissioned Officers and Privates of Infantry of the Army of the United States , 1917, pp. 149- 150 Together we can d o almost anything. -CSM Sammy W.

Once you have that morale, and have built an effective, combat -ready team, you'll find that your soldier s will take the responsibility for sustaining the team's level of proficiency.

There's no standard method for getting the groups working together again. You can assign them more tasks requiring them to work together, or read the riot act to them. There are other metho ds and you use the one that's most effective for the particular situation. -SFC Reuben H. Heutner , \"Platoon Sergeants.\" Soldiers , Sep 1975, p. 9 It was no accident that you became a team leader. Someone saw in you the potenti al for excellence, the will to win, or some other quality. -1SG Jeffrey J. Mellinger , \"Open Letters to Three NCOs.\" Infantry , May - Jun 1989, p. 17 Soldiers' ability to sustain themselves and their fellow soldiers during per iods of high stress is built upon rock - hard confidence in themselves and their leadership chain beginning with fire team leaders or the noncommissioned officer of their section.... What we have learned and relearned in our Army is that unit cohesion and te amwork are what give individual soldiers the confidence to use initiative, to be resourceful, and to be all they can be. -SMA Glen E. Morrell , \"What Soldiering Is All About.\" ARMY , Oct 1986, pp. 41, 42 Cohesion A company of s oldiers, after they have served together for some months, become like a large family. -SGT Augustus Meyers , Ten Years in the Ranks U.S. Army [1854- 1866], p. 43 We sort of look after each other the way the members of a family do . You don't really have any family but the boys, nor any home except the one you make each night with them. -SGT Henry Giles , WWII, The G.I. Journal of Sergeant Giles , p. 349 The communion between men [in inf antry battalions] is as profound as any between lovers. [It is] a bond that cannot be broken. -SFC Kent F. Haws quoting from A Rumor of War , in \"The NCO\" In Their Own Words , 1991, no page number In the crucible of shared hardship and danger, social conventions and prejudices have a tendency to boil away, and what is left behind is a relationship between the members of a unit that goes deeper than friendship. -The NCO Guide , 1986, p. 124 The most effective rapport is based on shared interests or goals. This relationship is characterized by mutual trust, respect, and understanding. This is achieved when each of the individuals perceives the other as competent, mature, and responsible. -MSG Melchor Becena , \"Advising Host -Nation Forces: A Critical Art.\" Special Warfare , May 1993, p. 27 This horse was my special pet; every soldier's horse ought to be. It may be a little hard for a good soldier of fine feelings to pet a miserable plug, and on the other hand, it may be a little hard for a good horse to think much of his plug master - both combinations that ought not to exist. Good men and horses having faith in each other will follow the right kind of leader to victory or annihilation without a murmur. -1SG Perci val G. [1849- 1854], pp. 178- 179 Trust establishes the character within a command and ties leaders and subordinates together. Camaraderie and cohesion are products of demonstrated trust between leaders and subordinates. Trusting a soldier to perform a critical task places his reputation and pride on the line. The mission or task becomes very personal; the stakes are high when trust is involved. The weakest leader or soldier will try harder when placed in the limelight under fire. When the trusted soldier is successful and that success is recognized by the leader, the soldier gains confidence. With each success the attitude and proficiency of the soldier improve. -SMA Glen E. Morrell , \"Hard Work, Leadership Still Keys to Quality.\" ARMY , Oct 1984, p. 52 Trust is that absolute element which all successful relationships must be built on. Trust- the bedrock of the Noncommissioned Officer Corps. -1SG Larry L. Tolar , in \"The NCO\" In Their Own Words , 1991, no page number Cohesion in Combat War brings out the worst in you. It turns you into a mad, fightin' animal, but it also brings out something else, something I jes don't know how to describe, a sort of tenderness and love for the fellows fightin' with you. It's sort of clean, like a fire of pine logs on a frosty night. - SGT Alvin York , WWI, Sergeant York: His Own Life Story and War Diary , p. 212 Colors have symbolized military units fo r thousands of years. Some of the most interesting episodes in the Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 25 history of our country have to do with flags. One of these tells how a small group of Union soldiers, held prisoners by the Confederates, made a Stars and Stripes from their own clothing, f lew it for a few minutes from the rafters of the old warehouse in which they were imprisoned, and then tore it into 22 pieces, one for each man who helped make it. Every one then hid the piece of flag in his clothing and took it with him when released from prison. In the years following the war, the pieces were finally recovered and sewed together again to form the flag, which is still in existence. -FM 21 -13, The Soldier's Guide , 1952, p. 31 The underlying reason that the U.S. Army Aviation is the best in the world is because of dedicated, courageous, tactically and technically proficient soldiers. [As a Platoon Sergeant in Vietnam] we received a base camp message one day that one of our four-man, long range patrols was in contact and had taken two casual ties.... My First Sergeant and I immediately went across the air field to the Division Aviation Operations Center.... In about 20 minutes we were over the team. In the meantime helicopter gunships were on station suppressing the enemy, who was making an all-out effort to annihilate the team. Within minutes the gunships stopped the assault and allowed us to land on an old fire base approximately 500 meters away from the team. I told the pilot, Captain Jackson , to drop us and leave because of the incoming small arms fire. He said, \"We will wait for you.\"... We did extract the team. -SMA Julius W. Gates , \"U.S. Army Aviation: Dedicated, Courageous Soldiers.\" Army Aviation , 31 Jan 1989, pp. 4, 3 Lasting Cohesion In a street near the arsenal we stacked our guns, and upon their bayonets we hung for the last time our equipments. It was a sad moment; we had not realized before how it would seem to separate.... Eyes grew moist, cheeks that had been unblanched amid the horrors of the battle -field became pale and sad in those moments of separation. The ties that bound us together were of the most sacred nature; they had been begotten in hardships and baptized in blood. Men who lived together in the little shelter tent, sle pt beneath the same blanket, had divided the scanty rations, and \"drank from the same canteen\" were now to be separated forever. The last good -bye was said, our ranks were broken for the last time, and we turned our faces homeward.... Many of us have never met each other since; I presume we never shall in this world; but in that day when the reveille of God shall awaken the slumbering hosts of humanity, may we reform our ranks upon the parade ground of eternity, as the soldiers of the great Prince of Peace. -Theodore Gerrish , 20th Maine Volunteers, Civil War, in Rank and File , pp. 412- 413 \"Once a soldier, always a soldier,\" is a maxim, the truth of which I need not insist on to anyone who has ever served in the army for any length of time, and especially, if the service he has seen has embraced those scenes and occasions where every man, first or last, from one cause or another, owes the preservation of his all, health and life not excepted, to the kindness, the generosity, the fellow -feeling of his comrades. -William Cobbett , who enlisted in the British Army in 1794 and rose to Member of Parliament, in Rank and File , p. 410 I was glad to come out of [WWII], but even then I felt what I feel now, and what every old soldier feels: a gratitude for having been there, and an abiding admiration amounting to awe for the sheer ability of my comrades. -George MacDonald Fraser (former Lance - CPL), Quartered Safe Out Here , p. 87 In our natio nal cemeteries, there are rows upon rows of white crosses where...soldiers rest for eternity. On many of these white crosses is the inscription \"Here rests in honored glory a comrade in arms, known but to God.\" While it is true that their names are not kno wn to us, we know them - for they are soldiers, one of us. -CSM John W.

Klinga , WWII, in Clarke of St. Vith , p. 25 It is particularly important that [the military spirit of an Army] should pervade the officers and non - commissioned officers: if they be capable and the nation brave, there need be no fear fo r the men. -Jomini , The Art of War , 1838, p. 458 Although we no longer carry our colors into battle to rally our units, by tradition we entrust the responsibility for their safeguarding, care, and display to you, the senio r NCOs of the Army. Symbolically, then, by that charge, we have placed in your hands the spirit of the Army through the regiments those colors represent. - GEN John A. Wickham , Collected Works , 1987, p. 190 Only one person at a time can nurture the Warrior Spirit. We've never seen it succeed when tried as a group process. It must be done one on one, even if it's done with individual members of a group. Even in team building, individuals must feel there's a personal involvement fr om the leader or role model, even if it is a remote involvement. A leader who knows and exhibits some personal concern for a subordinate tends to earn the loyalty and trust of that person. And, a leader who identifies, trains, or enhances a skill in someon e else earns that person's willingness to obey.... Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 26 Apathy and lack of initiative, as well as tolerance of these traits, will kill the Warrior Spirit graveyard dead.... If we can define, identify, nurture, and train the Warrior Spirit, how will we fit it into the modern battlefield? In a world of global technology, will there still be room for the spirit of our battle -scarred ancestors? We believe so. But, we also believe we must find new ways to teach old techniques.... Our 21st century warrior must be a ble to think in many functional areas at once, using the technological tools at hand to apply ancient principles to future tactics and techniques. (Watch any youngster playing a new video game and you see the spirit in action.) Our brain and reflexes can w ork much faster than rational thought. That's the future level that we must use to train the spirit. -SGMs Bobby Owens , Miles Pitman , Ben Moore Nethken Miller Warrior Spirit.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1994, pp. 8, 9 At the summit we came upon a strange scene; there on the very edge of the hill, somewhat concealed by shrubbery, a German machine gun had been engaged taking advantage of the unobstructed field of fire as we crossed through the wheat. But now retribution had been meted out, the German gunner was dead at his gun. Seated as in the act of firing, his finger on the trigger, his head bent forward on the breech, a bu llet hole in the forehead and gaping bayonet wound in the throat. I never thought I would reach a point where I would glory in death, but the sight of that fellow positively caused a thrill of exaltation to sweep over me, and tired as I was, I laughed aloud. He had killed and maimed many of my men, and here he was, himself a victim of war in its tempest of ruthless punishment for those who defy its course. My platoon sergeant told me afterward that when I laughed every man in the platoon caught the spirit o f it and laughed a grim short laugh that boded no good for any other [enemy soldiers] we met up with that day. -LT Marvin H. Taylor , 23d Infantry, WWI, The Second Division American Expeditionary Force in France 1917- 1919, pp. 266 -267 Including Everyone in the Team You and I came up in the same way. We spent a lot of time in the armored and infantry divisions, in TO&E units, and we know how they work. There's one thing I want to do while I'm in office and I want you to help me do it. The majority of the Army is not in divisions. I want you and I to visit as many of those soldiers as we can. When you go to an installation, make sure to visit the support sections. Go to the communications and the engineers. I want you to continue working with the National Guard and reserves. -GEN Edward C. Meyer to SMA William A. Connelly , 1979, in The Sergeants Major of the Army , p. 123 Soldiers must feel that they are a part of the unit's overall mission, and they must certainly have pride in what the unit does. This is important for all NCOs, but for the ordnance NCO it is often the difference between having a cohesive, effective team or a bunch of soldiers praying for orders to leave for greener pastures. Ordnance NCOs must make their soldiers understand that the job they do is so important that the unit could not possibly function without them. They must understand that being an ordnance soldier is a demanding job, which requires technic al training in addition to training in the basic soldier skills. -SSG James P. Gerkin , \"The Ordnance NCO- Continuing a Proud Tradition.\" Ordnance , Nov 1989, p. 12 When things came up that brought the company together, [the mech anics] were left in the motor pool. I felt kind of bad when I was coming up and I saw that. Now that I've made rank and am in a position to make changes like that in some of the units I was at, I've seen a different light in their eyes. They are now part o f what the company does. -SFC Jerry T. Morris , in \"On Leadership.\" Soldiers , Mar 1985, p. 31 Medics are a vital part of your team and need to be totally involved in your plan. Consider them the same as any other soldiers in you r unit. They need to be fed, worried about, and checked just as often as your other troops. Don't think of them as an attachment, think of them as yours! -SGM Daniel J. Bullis , Sergeants' Business , May -Jun 1986, p. 4 There is nothing better than having a mechanic get the first kill on an OPFOR T -72 outside the perimeter of the combat trains [at the NTC]. If you are one of those NCOs, you need to remember you will be in the fight. The 32nd Guards will brin g it to you. The difference between a serious loss of morale and an exhilarating feeling of confidence often lies in the fact that some support sections back there brought death and destruction upon the enemy. They're warriors too. - CSM Eddie Velez , \"An NCO Prepares for NTC.\" Army Trainer , Spring 1989, p. 19 Pride Most soldiers want to be proud of their units.

Says Hall : \"Sergeant, what is your choice?\" \"Slice of the ham and section of rib and loin.\" \"Now, Corporal, pray what may be your choice?\" \"The same as the sergeant, if you please, sir.\" \"Now, Adam , what may I serve you?\" I suppose, like Adam of old, You will want a section of rib, To replace the one that was stole.\" -Arthur J.

To avoid the irregular and partial distribution of this article (which has been a good deal complain'd of) he expressly orders that no spirits shall be issued to any part of the Troops i n the future but in consequence of General or Special Orders from Headquarters. A deviation from this rule will be at the risque and peril of the issuing Commissary. -1778, Ordeal at Valley Forge , p. 54 Unit Newspapers [During Desert Storm when newspap ers] were weeks late when we finally received them, so we found other ways of keeping the soldier up to date. Our S1 section published a Battleking Bulletin , which was both distributed to our soldiers and sent back to Germany for distribution to family mem bers. It contained news about the brigade and our soldiers. Using a short -wave radio, we followed world events on BBC, and then published a one-page sheet called Headliners , which was posted in the mess tent and in other high- visibility areas. -MSG Gregor y A. Drake , in Personal Perspectives on the Gulf War, 1993, p. 22 Unit newspapers, which seem to thrive while the organizations are preparing for combat in the States, have a habit of withering and dying just at the time they could be of most help to the men of the command- when the outfit goes into action overseas.... It's when a unit is Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 29 in combat that a unit newspaper, chatty, humorous, full of information, and thoroughly American, can be of greatest service.... The secret of keeping the paper coming is simply determination to get out a paper in some form, no matter what happens.... The paper is an important part of the division, and more than one man has credited it with a share in building the 45th's spirit as a fighting unit .... The success or failure of a GI newspaper in the field depends upon the resourcefulness and sincerity of the staff, and the understanding, confidence, and cooperation of the officers in command.... The 45th's first landing was in Sicily, with its newsp aper's instructions limited to \"get out a paper\" [and] by D plus three had produced a two- page, printed newspaper, which is now a collector's item. -SGT Don Robinson, \"GI Newspaper.\" Infantry , Mar 1945, pp. 49, 50 Motivation Motivation...is a condition of mind and heart. -NCO Education and Professional Development Study , 1971, p. 22 Successive generations of American soldiers have stood before NCOs who've prefaced their military instructions with admonitions that, \"this will sa ve your life in Vietnam,\" or, \"if the balloon goes up, you'll be glad you learned this.\" Today, though hot spots around the world may catch our military eye for a moment, they will not spark the same kind of \"real world\" urgency or fervent patriotism that has motivated us and our soldiers in the past.... Without an \"evil empire\" or a Third World \"boogey man\" presenting a legitimate external threat, how will NCOs motivate their soldiers in the years to come? The answer is clear. Our motivation is our pride. We learn because we want to be the best, and we train because we are this nation's professionals in the military art and science of waging and winning wars. As we move toward a new century, our motivation needs to be internal pride and not external threats . And, since we as NCOs set the standards...the motivation to be the best needs to start with each one of us. -MSG John K.

And even where there is no route -marching, the mere come- and-go, the roll and flourish, of the drums and fifes round barracks is as warmi ng and cheering as the sight of a fire in a room.... A band...revives memories; it quickens associations; it opens and unites the hearts of men more surely than any other appeal. In that respect it assists recruiting perhaps more than any other agency. Th e tunes that it employs and the words that go with them may seem very far removed from heroism or devotion; but the magic and the compelling power are there to make men's souls realise certain truths which their minds might doubt. More than that. No one.. .can say for certain where the soul of a battalion lives; but the expression of that soul is most often found in the Band. It stands to reason that a body of 1,200 men whose lives are pledged to each other's keeping must have some common means of expressin g their thoughts and moods to themselves and to their world. The Band can feel the mood and interpret the thought.... In a cholera- camp in India, where the men were suffering very badly, the Band of the 10th Lincolns started a regimental sing -song one night with that queer defiant tune, \"The Lincolnshire Poacher.\"... It was merely their regimental march, which the men had heard a thousand times. There was nothing in it except - except all England.... But, as it was given very softly, at that bad time in tha t terrible camp of death, it was the one thing in the world which could have restored - as it did restore - shaken men to pride, humour, and self - control.... A man who has had any experience of the Service can testify that a battalion is better for music at every turn- happier, easier to handle, and with greater zest for its daily routine if that routine is sweetened by melody and rhythm - melody for the mind and rhythm for the body.... The Band can declare on our behalf, without shame or shyness, something o f what we feel, and so help us to reach a hand towards the men who have risen up to save us.... The Army needs music - its own music, for, more than any calling, soldiers do not live by bread alone. - Rudyard Kipling , address \"Nationa l Bands.\" 1915, p. 1- 3 Esprit de Corps Esprit is the thing that holds armies together. -SGT Bill Mauldin , Up Front , 1945, p. 1 Esprit has a way of sneaking up on the worst of us. -Bill Mauldin , The Bras s Ring , 1971, p. 122 The 82nd had been one of the great fighting divisions of World War I.... It was a proud division, but it was a name, a legend, a memory only in February of 1942.... To both General [Omar] Bradley and me it seemed vitally important to...plant in each man's mind the idea that valor endured from generation to generation.... One of the first things we did, therefore, was to invite the grand old soldier [Alvin] York down from his home in Tennessee to tell the massed division about that great Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 30 fight.... Sergeant York's visit had a great deal to do with the early inculcation of that supreme confidence, that magnificent esprit , which later was to be the hallmark of the airborne. He created in the minds of...youngsters of every station and class, the conviction that an aggressive soldier, well trained and well armed, can fight his way out of any situation. -GEN Matthew B.

Throughout the 17th century and most of the 18th century the halberd remained an object of ceremony carried by guards, court attendants and sergeants as a symbol of rank. It was no longer a real weapon, but it was a sufficiently important object to attract the attention of metalworkers who fashioned some truly decorative specimens. Such halberds are the true works of art among American polearms and thus the most sought afte r by collectors today.... Procuring a halberd was generally the individual responsibility of each sergeant, just as it was the duty of each officer to provide his spontoon. Often these arms were handed down from father to son, and a single halberd or spon toon [was sometimes] used in a number of wars by a number of generations.... In a military encampment the sergeant would set his halberd in front of his tent so that he could be easily located.... In a tight situation the halberd was useful in a number of ways.

The backbone of the Roman Army was the centurion, a senior professional noncom promoted from the ranks who supervised recruit training...and led his hundred - man unit in combat.... With the collapse of the Roman Empire, however, the concept of a Noncommissioned Officer Corps would take a thousand year furlough.... Noncommissioned officers reappear once more (bearing the now -familiar titles of corporal and sergeant) with the rediscovery of professional armies in the 15th century. - Dr. John Finnegan, \"The NCO Through History.\" INSCOM , Aug -Sep 1989, p. 26. *Moreover choose able men from all the people, such as fear God, men who a re trustworthy and who hate a bribe; and place such men over the people as rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. - Exodus 18:21 [See also Exodus 18:25, and Deuteronomy 1:15] The origin of the noncommissioned officer can be traced back to the Roman legions. The Roman success in war was due to march formation, camp preparation, and response to orders in battle. The training of the Roman soldier was long, detailed, and intense. The Roman commanders...picked exceptional soldiers to be commanders of ten and assistants to commanders of 100 and 600, to supervise the individual training, to carry out their plans, and perform administrative and logistical tasks. The commanders of ten and assistants to the commanders of 100 and 600 were the first \"noncommissioned\" officers (called principalis). An indication of their importance can be derived from the English translation of that Latin/Roman word which roughly means principal, main, key, or first in rank. - FM 22 -600-20, The Duties, Responsibilitie s and Authority of NCO's, 1977, p. 14 Some Roman NCO positions are still in use today, such as the signifer - standard -bearer; tesserarius- orderly [first] sergeant (title derived the tessera commentarienses Soldier , pp. 79, 85- 86 and The Army of the Caesars , pp. 308- 309 Centurions The real backbone of the [Roman] army was undoubtedl y the corps of centurions, sixty to each legion. These were professional, long -service non - commissioned officers who filled positions of command roughly through modern grades from platoon sergeant to lieutenant colonel. -\"Societies and Armies.\" Center of Military History study, 1966, p. 8 Centurions [were] the principal professional officers of the Roman army who did a lion's share of the work.... These formidable men combined the functions and prestige of a modern company commander and sergeant -major or top sergeant. -The Army of the Caesars, pp. xxii, xxxiii Polybius [c. 200 BC] makes the specific point that [centurions] were not selected simply because of their courage, but especially on the basis of their leadership ability and their s teadfastness (\"as leaders, steadfast and deep of mind\"). -History of the Art of War , Vol 1, p. 431 [Centurion Petronius Fortunatus spent] 46 years in that rank, completing a total of 50 years of service.... As a centurion he saw service in thirteen legions and in almost all parts of the Empire. -The Roman Soldier , p. 88 Centurions in the Bible As [Jesus] entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, beseeching him and saying, \"Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress.\" And he said to him, \"I will come and heal him.\" But the centurion answered him, \"Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, \"Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.\"... And to the centurion Jesus said, \"Go; be it done for you as you have believed.\" And the servant was healed at that very moment. -Matthew 8:5-10 and 8:13 (See also Luke 7: 1-10) At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius , a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort, a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms liberally to the people and prayed constantly to God. -Acts 10:1 -2 Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 33 Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, and said, \"Certainly this man was innocent!\" -Luke 23:47 (See also Matthew 27:54) The Development of the American NCO Corps The American NCO, like the American Army itself, became a unique blend of traditions from several different European Armies and our own colonial traditions and heritage. -William T. Licatovich , \"The Sergeants' Business , Mar-Apr 1989 p. 21 A combination of factors, including the relative lack of rigid class lines in the New World, affected the evolution of a new kind of military organization in the [13 original] colonies. Freed from the need to maintain large standing forces, with more economic and social freedom at a local level than in Europe, Americans quickly abandoned blind obedience as a foundation for their militia system. Instead, they created a new blend in which talent and competence mattered most. Leadership became a positive influence. -The Story of the Noncommissioned Officer Corps , pp. 36- 37 In our early wars [NCOs] served as leaders on the battlefield.... Armies in the eighteenth century used \"linear tactics\" - that is, they fought standing in lines facing the enemy, as in close- order drill today. As units advanced and turned on the battlefield, gaps inevitably appeared in the ranks. It was the NCO's essential duty to close these gaps. Posted directly behind the line, the NCO would order the men, under enemy fire, to close ranks and advance in cadence, a notable test of discipline and willpower.... As time went on, new weapons forced changes in tactics and in leadership roles for noncommissioned officers. Rifles with gr eater range replaced smooth -bore muskets, breech -loaders replaced muzzle- loaders in both the infantry and artillery, and semiautomatic firing was achieved with the Gatling gun. These weapons caused high casualties in formations arrayed in lines on both sid es, with a predictable result: linear tactics began to give way to a more open type of warfare. The new open tactics had an immediate impact on the role of NCOs in battle. Without surrendering their responsibilities as file closers and color bearers, NCOs now also had to lead scouting and skirmishing parties forward to locate enemy forces. This new role was especially emphasized after the Civil War on the western frontier. NCOs in both the cavalry and infantry led patrols that might last several weeks and cover hundreds of miles over the plains and into the mountains in search of hostile Indians. The corporal's eight -man squad was a tight -knit unit which trained and fought together, ate around the same fire, and slept in the same tent. -Time -Honored Profes sionals , 1989, no page number The tactics of [the Civil War] called for officers up to the rank of brigadier general to lead their men in person, and in consequence officer casualties were high. As a battle went on, sergeants and corporals often found themselves assuming command of companies. In extreme cases, such as the charge of Pickett 's Virginia division at Gettysburg in 1863, whole regiments lost all their commissioned officers. The demonstrated ability of the NCOs to handle the burden of leadership in such cases permanently affected the corps' future status. -The Story of the Noncommissioned Officer Corps , p. 66 The Indian Wars in the latter part of the [19th] century also added to the NCO's role as combat leader. Since most of the fighting was in the form of small unit skirmishes, and the soldiers were often raw recruits, the NCO expertise proved invaluable. -William T. Licatovich , \"The Business , May -Jun 1989, p. 21 The fight against Philippine guerrillas from 1899 -1902, and in 1900 the expedition against the Boxer insurgents in China, were mostly small- unit actions that again tested the mettle of small unit commanders. During those deadly little battles and skirmishes, it was the war - hardened NCOs who formed the military backbone around which the inexperienced troops could rally and defeat their opponents. -Douglas V. Meed , \"U.S. Emerges as World Power.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1995, p. 23 By sheer force of character, superior training, and long service this class [of noncommissioned officers] built up for itself an artificial status distinct from that of the private soldier. -Secretary of War William Taft , Report of the Secretary of War , 1907, pp. 79- 80 The battle of the Somme and the horror of Verdun - a battle that cost hundreds of thousands of lives - taught the survivors on both sides to avoid mass formations. Usually led by a noncommissioned officer, small fire teams of infantrymen learned to take advantage of mist along river banks and every fold of ground, while providing covering fire for other groups nearby. At [GEN John] Pershing's insistence, Americans learned the lesson too. As weapons and tactics continued to evolve in twentieth century warfare, the role of the NCO would continue to grow.... World War II made more demands upon the noncommissioned officer corps and had a greater impact on the NCO's rol e and status than any previous conflict in American history.... Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 34 [With the initiation of the NCOES in 1971] the noncommissioned officer corps' potential would at last be fully developed.... Looking back over the more than two centuries that have passed si nce the creation of the U.S. Army, it is clear that the evolution of the NCO's role and status has been gradual, at times uneven, and most pronounced in the last twenty years. -The Story of the Noncommissioned Officer Corps , 1989, pp. 15, 21, 29 The His tory of the \"Backbone of the Army\" Kipling is the man who coined one phrase familiar to every soldier: \"The NCO is the backbone of the Army.\" -Dr. Robert H.

They symbolized the glories of the past, stood guard over the present, and provided in spiration for the future. Both officers and men fully understood that their colors could not be surrendered. To return from battle without them was the ultimate disgrace. For example, General Orders of the Army of the Potomac [during the Civil War] denied any unit that lost its colors in action the right to carry others without the authority of the commanding general. Permission would not be given in cases where a unit had lost its colors through misconduct, \"until such troops shall, by their bravery on other fields, have fully retrieved their tarnished honor.\" -The Story of the Noncommissioned Officer Corps , p. 66 The colors indicated whether the unit was advancing or standing in place, and what the direction of movement was. As a result, unit colors became the focal point of enemy fire, and the noncoms who carried them ran great risks. At Gettysburg, one...unit's colors had been hit 87 times by bullets and shell fragments. -Dr. John Finnegan, \"The Civil War NCO.\" INSCOM , Aug -Sep 1989, p. 32 The color sergeant - entrusted with the unit standard...carried the spirit of his regiment and perhaps ultimately the fate of his cause in battle. -GEN John A.

The Order, which is interesting from other points of view, reads: \"The three Regiments of Fo ot Guards are to furnish a detachment...under Command of a Lieut. -Colonel, a Captain, an Ensign, an Adjutant and a Sergeant -Major, as Guards for the balls and operas at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, and to be aiding and assisting in the preservation of the peace, and preventing all manner of profaneness, rudeness, drunkenness, or indecencies, and not to permit any person whatever to enter the said theatres in habits worn by clergy.\" -MAJ T.

The ser geant major in this position serves as the senior enlisted advisor and consultant to the Chief of Staff of the Army. The SMA provides information on problems affecting enlisted personnel and proposed solutions to these problems; on standards, professional development, growth, and advancement of NCOs; and on morale, training, pay, promotions, and quality of life for soldiers and family members. Utilizing command information channels, the SMA keeps soldiers current on important NCO issues, and through the pub lic media informs the American people of the Army mission, soldier accomplishments and future enlisted trends. He directs NCO support channel activities through the major commands' command sergeants major by using written and verbal communications. Other f unctions of this position include: presenting the enlisted viewpoint to Congress, DA boards and committees, meeting with military and civilian organizations to discuss enlisted affairs, receiving enlisted personnel who visit HQDA, and representing all Army enlisted personnel at appropriate ceremonies. -TC 22 -6, The Army Noncommissioned Officer Guide , 1990, pp. 48- 49 The Major Commands Command Sergeants Major Conference...was something the Army did not have prior to the establishment of a Sergeant Major of the Army. Soldiers of all grades and ranks, from all levels, had an opportunity to present ideas and recommendations for improving the Army's morale, training, readiness, proficiency, and anything else that could be improved. They simply made suggestions to their immediate enlisted supervisor. Suggestions were consolidated at each level and submitted to the next higher level.... This gave the enlisted soldier a voice that was heard at the very top, a voice he had never had before. [This way] we got lots of things approved that would never have even surfaced through the officers' chain of command. Even the things that were disapproved were at least recorded and copies of everything considered were sent to all commands afterwards. That was an excellent way of informing commanders Army -wide of the things that interested soldiers.... The Army will be forever indebted to General Harold K. Johnson for establishing the SMA position. There are countless significant improvements that wer e made and will continue to be made as a result of the influence of the Sergeants Major of the Army. [GEN Johnson was] very concerned for the soldiers in his Army, and he left a system in place that will continue to provide for their best interests. -SMA George W. Dunaway , Center of Military History Interview, 1990, pp. 39, 40, 56- 57 Over the years, the SMAs have directly influenced decisions on a number of enlisted issues. A partial list includes: creating and hosting the first Command Sergeants Major Conference in Washington, D.C., in 1966; making a relatively bump -free transition to an all- volunteer force in the early 1970s; enforcing draft registration; establishing the first sergeant and sergea nts major courses at Ft.

It is located on Biggs Field at Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas. In its two wings, built entirely with private donations, visitors find constantly changing, colorful displays and exhibits detailing the NCO Corps from its beginning in 1775 to the present. For former and currently serving NCOs, the Museum is often more than a place through which to walk and gaze at uniforms and equipment . In the glass cases housing each exhibit, NCOs use their own reflections - a reminder especially to all still serving that they are part of a long NCO chain- to see that they are the links that join those who have performed with valor and those who are yet to serve. The Museum is also the repository for the NCO Oral History Program. The personal accounts of NCOs from WWI to [the] present, will provide future historians detailed information about each period through the eyes of the NCO. The Museum also main tains a library that includes letters, diaries, and other documents dating from the 18th century, and original photographs from the Civil War period. -\"NCOs - It's Your Museum.\" NCO Journal , Fall 1993, p. 3 After visiting the Museum of the NCO...people will have a greater appreciation for the NCO's accomplishments and contributions to the nation. -Dr. Daniel Zimmerman , in \"NCO Corps: Museum Is First to Be Dedicated Solely to Noncommissioned Officer.\" Engineer , Summer 1981, p. 11 Famous NCOs Some famous people who served as NCOs include Chief of Staff LTG Adna R.

Truman ; Chairman of the JCS GEN William W. Vessey ; and Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgi Zhukov, and possibly Shakespeare. -A Treasury of NCO Quotations , 1997, no page number Was Shakespeare an NCO? Between [Shakespeare's ] 21st and 28th years, and thus preceding the known beginning of his career as playwright, the so -called Lost Years, 1585 -1592, have attracted partisans of various trades and professions, each of which would like to assign its own vocation to the young Shakespeare . But no claim is as stron g as the military's. The Lost Years embrace the period of England's bitter war against Spain, culminated by defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588.... But aside from his prime soldierly age, his country's war, and his [intimate] knowledge of recruiting abus es, the most convincing testimony to Shakespeare's military service lies in the 37 plays, which reveal an astounding expertise in the lingo, customs, and practices of military life. Professor Paul Jorgensen devotes an entire book to elaborating the pervasive military context of Shakespeare's works. Shakespeare's editor, G. B. Harrison , speculates that the Bard did not spend all his youth near the theater. \"When we come to look closely into Shakespeare's plays,\" he writes, \"it is clear that he had an extraordinary knowledge of soldiers.\" Sir Duff Cooper , after a mi croscopic examination of Shakespeare's lines and scenes, concludes that the dramatist had served as an NCO in the Low Countries. Cooper titled his book Sergeant Shakespeare . All of Shakespeare's great tragic heroes were soldiers, but it is in treating the predicaments of the enlisted men that Shakespeare's accents ring most unmistakably true. -\"From the Archives.\" Parameters , Spring 1987, inside back cover Most creative writers make use of their personal experience both in selection of background and portrayal of character.... We have no reason to suppose that Shakespeare formed an exception to this rule. Reading through the list of dramatis personae of those thirty -seven plays, we cannot but be astonished at the number of soldiers' names on that immortal roster. Admitting that in the historical plays, classical as well as modern, soldiers impose thei r presence by the subject of the story, we may yet question why it was necessary to introduce them and the language of their trade, so frequently into plays and poems that had no relish of the military in them [such as Romeo and Juliet , All's Well That Ends Well , Cymbeline , and Venus and Adonis , The Rape of Lucrece]. Throughout the works of Shakespeare...the military metaphor...continually crops up, even in places where its employment seems hardly suitable. [This] would not prove so powerful an argument if it were not supported by the large number of soldiers who are brought upon the stage, and the sympathy and understanding with which they are Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 37 presented. -Duff Cooper , Sergeant Shakespeare , pp. 75- 78, 96 [After reading Shakespeare's Henry Sergeant Hutton ] asked \"Was Shekspeer ivver in th'Army?\" I said that most sc holars thought not, but that there were blanks in his life, so it was possible that, like his friend Ben Jonson, he had served in the Low Countries, or even in Italy. Hutton shook his head. \"If 'e wesn't in aboot it, man.\"... Hutton was a military hard case...but Shakespeare had talked to him across the centuries...on his own subject. -George M acDonald Fraser (former Lance -CPL), WWII, Quartered Safe Out Here , p. 129 *Probably from \"tap\", meaning mad Teamwork and the Total Army Reserve Components (Reserves and National Guard) If we are to live up to the respons ibilities that history has placed upon this great land, then it is important that we know we can count on each other. It starts with the basic element of our Army - squads; and is true of the Total Army - active, Guard, and Reserve. We need each other. We ne ed the other services, and we need the support of the American public. -SMA Glen E. Morrell , \"What Soldiering Is All About.\" ARMY , Oct 1986, p. 42 History tells us: Every time the Active Army took the Reserve and Guard to war, we were successful. -CSM William J. H. Peters , \"From the TRADOC CSM.\" Army Trainer , Spring 1985, p. 27 Most people don't really realize how much we depend on the National Guard and the Reserves. They train far more than pe ople know.... They are good [and] we need them. -SMA George W. Dunaway , Center of Military History Interview, 1990, pp. 3, 4 We can't go to war without the Reserve Components....We must continue to help improve the Reserves. The NCO corps, the soldier, everyone should make the RC feel that they truly are part of the Total Army. -NCOPD Study , Vol 1, 1986, p. 211 The National Guard...had its origin when the militia of Massachusetts Bay Colony was organized on 13 December, 1636 . -Army National Guard Noncommissioned -19 Sergeant Belton Savarie, 2d Free Men of Color, Louisiana Militia 1814 -1815 [was] one of the first identifiable black American Noncommissioned Officers [and] saw combat in operations attendant to the battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812. He serves as an example of the countless numbers of Noncommissioned Officers from the Reserve Forces who rallied to America's defense throughout our history. Sergeant Savarie made the supreme sacrifice to his country. He was mortally wounded and died on 10 January 1815. -DA Pam 623 -205, The NCO Evaluation Reporting System \"In Brief\", 1988, foreword The linear service of the reserve component NCO is the base on which the unit sustains its readiness. It is the continuity of service of the reserve NCO that maintains the steady and positive building influence on unit performance. -SFC Albert Killian , \"The Reser ve Component NCO.\" Ordnance , Nov 1989, p. 20 We [the Active Army and the Reserve Components] must be ready to go to war together.

The National Guard family contributes immeasurabl y in time, commitment, and support of the National Guard member's acquisition of skills and training. -Army National Guard Noncommissioned Officer Handbook , 1989, p. C -17 One of the major ingredients in a well -rounded organization is teamwork. Troops are taught teamwork Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 38 in their jobs, but it takes more than that. There has to be a good sports program and there has to be some social life that involves the family. -SMA George W. Dunaway , in The Sergeants Major of the Army , 1995, p. 59 There really [is] a tie between a soldier's readiness in the military and family business. -Sylvia Kidd (SMA spouse), in \"Through the Eyes of the Wives.\" Soldiers , Jun 1995, p. 26 The total military family life extends beyond the home and hearth.... The young wife has to make the best of life wherever she and her family happen to be.... She should [have] an idea of what her [husband's] job requires of him and she should...encourage and support him. Above all she should let him know she has faith in him and in what he's doing. -Rita Van Autreve (SMA spouse), \"A Career Wife's View.\" Soldiers , Feb 1974, p. 32 When your husband becomes a Command Sergeant Major...your new position puts you at a vantage point to see the unit as a whole. From this viewpoint, watch for problem areas that relate to families; listen to and evaluate the concerns they express to you. Share these family -related issues with your husband who is in a unique position to help improve the situations. [Being a] Commander Sergeant Major's or First Sergeant's wife...is a time of personal growth. Crossley , The Army Wife Handbook , 1991, pp. 267, 270 Our ancestral Army [NCO] wives who traveled West in covered wagons aid ed the younger wives by providing a helping hand or a mothering touch. Our means of transportation has improved, but nothing has lessened the young wives' need for support and guidance. By helping the younger wives adjust and be happy in their new environm ent, you are directly helping your husband's unit; soldiers are more inclined to be content and perform their jobs well if their wives are happy. - Ann Crossley , The Army Wife Handbook , 1991, p. 267 I can't speak enough about ACS [Army Community Service]. It's the crossroads headquarters. It's the place you go that will lead you in any direction toward what you need or want.... Army Family Team Building for me is like the military spouse first aid kit. It is one of those things that whe n you are having your struggles, there is always something in that course you can use. - Wilhemina McKinney (SMA spouse), \"Wilhemina McKinney Prepared for Leadership Job at the Top.\" Cannoneer , 9 Nov 1995, p. 3A One of the most important ways spouses contribute to the Army is by how much they take care of so that the soldier can do his job. Good leaders at all levels respect and recognize these contributions, and also look for ways in which the time of fa mily members is being wasted. By good management these time wasters can often be turned into time savers. -Francine Merrick , in A Treasury of NCO Quotations , 1997, no page number What about your family when work takes so much of your time? Bring your family into the larger family of the unit. Before every major holiday my wife, Maggie, used to say, \"Well, how many soldiers can we have over?\" When your family is involved with the unit, your lives are richer. -CSM Steve Stoner , in A Treasury of NCO Quotations , 1997, no page number I think what makes this all work is that I have never become angry with him about what the Army requires of him. I have to understand his mission and what his j ob is.... For example, you can get so excited about something, like \"it's my birthday, and we're going to go out and have this big dinner,\" and then he comes home and he says, \"guess what, I have to go.\" You just have to refocus.... What we, as spouses, need to remember is that the better trained a soldier is, the more prepared and knowledgeable he is about his mission. For a spouse to be unhappy and doing things to take the soldier's focus off his duties, is not helping anyone. Let your soldier know you ar e proud of him. Let him know you respect the commitment of patriotism he has made to his country. -Wilhemina McKinney (SMA spouse), \"Wilhemina McKinney Prepared for Leadership Job at the Top.\" Cannoneer , 9 Nov 1995, p. 3A Family Support Groups The pride in the great accomplishments of our military police soldiers during the Gulf War should not only be felt by the soldiers who served in the desert, but by every member of the MP Regiment and those great folks we call the family support group. I hope I speak for all my fellow soldiers who served with me in the Gulf War - our sincere thanks and gratitude for the tremendous support provided by soldiers and families who were left behind. Rear detachment soldiers, wives, and family members got actively involved with unit family support groups. Their efforts gave peace of mind to the soldiers serving in the desert. Soldiers knew there was someone back home to lend a hand, lend an ear, or provide whatever assistan ce was needed by the family. Soldiers had to worry only about what was happening or going to happen in the sand, not about what might be going wrong back home.... If we all stay involved with the family support group, they will only get better and be more prepared for those unforeseen deployments that may come in the future. -CSM David W. Salter , \"Regimental Command Sergeant Major.\" Military Police , Dec 1991, p. 3 Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 39 A genuine concern for the soldier's family is a basic tenet of goo d leadership. Family support groups (FSGs) can have a dramatic impact on an organization. Although regulations require commanders to have FSGs, a commander is powerless to direct spouse participation.... Like most units in the 25th Division Artillery (Div Arty), relationships begin with a strong sponsorship program that includes meeting the new soldier and his family at the airport.... A representative from the FSG makes contact with the family soon after arrival. This kind of concern isn't soon forgotten b y the new family and will pay dividends in the future. These gestures demonstrate concern and begin to build the relationship between the organization and the family that's so critical during unit deployments. -CSM William J. Perry , \"Deployment Success - A Senior NCO's Perspective.\" Field Artillery , Jun 1993, p. 16 Friendship is a very important part of any spouse group, but the best groups have goals that are clear and easily attainable. An example is \"We want to: -Welcome each new battalion member. -Welcome each new baby. -Give baked goods to each single soldier and geographic bachelor during the Christmas holidays. -Visit each sick soldier or family member in the hospital.\" These kinds of goals do not overtax the members, and create a sense of contribution and achievement. When a member of the unit's Family Support Group visits the families of soldiers newly assigned to the unit, she can ask how well the family was sponsored, if they had any problems inprocessing, and what could be improved. Giving this feedback to the unit can be very helpful. It is also important not to confuse a Spouse's Group with a Family Support Group. Though in some areas their functions can overlap, the Family Support Group is an official Army prog ram, and the Commander's responsibility. One of the best benefits of the FSG is the partnership it creates between the unit and the families. It adds another dimension to the unit's life. -Rose Ann Spieles , (CSM spouse), in A Treas ury of NCO Quotations , 1997, no page number A good way to attract wives is with a family members' briefing by the battalion staff, held before a major exercise. -USACGSC RB 22 -2, The Commander's \"Link\", 1983, p. 33 [To encourage spouses to join a battal ion spouse group] include the information \"No elected officers, dues, constitution, or by -laws.\" And the final clincher: \"No board meetings, just an opportunity to make new friends.\"... One unit's NCO wives' group succeeded [because of] the informal organi zation, the lack of pressure to attend, and the feeling of belonging.... But most important was the sincerity of the friendship offered. -Kay Piotrzkowski , \"NCO/EM Wives: They Belong.\" ARMY , Jan 1972, pp. 45, 46 Family Separation s It gets lonely when we're separated. You have to handle it. It makes a better marriage if you can be strong. - Elissa McCrillis (NCO spouse), \"Army Wives Speak Out.\" Soldiers , Dec 1980, p. 29 Spouses of senior NCOs are experienced in dealing with family separations and know how to handle situations when they arise. If they volunteer it, their experience can help alleviate many of the difficulties faced by younger families.... Many spouses are independent and don't appreciate over bearing assistance. Yet all spouses need some support when their soldier spouses are away training. The best leaders are those who ensure their own families know where to go to get help, and encourage their spouses to become part of the family chain of sup port. -CSM James C. McKinney , CSM Lyle C. Daniels , and MSG Michael Lawson , \"CMTC: Training for Combat.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1991, p. 8 [During family separations] the soldier goes off to something else. He can't help but be involved in that something else. For family members left behind there's a big void they have to learn to fill. Getting together with other spouses [helps]. You keep routines the same. And you fill the tim e with friends and doing things with other wives and their kids. -Gay Sullivan (CSA spouse) and Sylvia Kidd (SMA spouse), in \"Through the Eyes of the Wives.\" Soldiers , Jun 1995, p. 26 [During separations] if you liv e near a military base you at least have the comfort of being able to take advantage of the facilities there but it still isn't easy.... Each time we have been separated I've learned something new about myself. I've found strength and courage that I didn't know I had.... The husband can assist his wife...by making sure she knows he is well and doing his best. You see, although he may not have to worry about his wife being safe and his children being cared for, she will worry about his health and about his happiness with his job. He can make her burden a lot lighter by letting her know he's OK. -Rita Van Autreve (SMA spouse), \"A Career Wife's View.\" Soldiers , Feb 1974, p. 33 There are several important messages leaders can gain from [In Love and War , by Admiral James and Sybil Stockdale ]. One is that our soldiers can survive internment, but only if we train them for that possibility, just as we train them to fight and avoid capture. An other lesson is that much of their survival depends on knowing that their military leaders will care for and Teamwork, Cohesion, and Esprit 40 support the military families in the soldier's absence. - MSG Jeffrey J. Mellinger , \"Book review of In Love and War.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1991, p. 22 Community Support Leadership is not restricted to a military environment. In fact, many communities are starving for the gifts and talents of leaders that their soldiers take for granted. NCOs have the experience and p roven level of caring to fill [voids]. Every community has at least one area where leaders can take charge. -SFC Tyrone LaValley , \"Increase Leadership Abilities Through Volunteerism.\" NCO , Spring 1994, p. 11 [I became i nvolved in my communities] because I felt it was a great way of finding out about my community and the people we were serving with. It offered a way to give something back to a community that had given so much. -Gay Sullivan (CSA spous e) and Sylvia Kidd (SMA spouse), in \"Through the Eyes of the Wives.\" Soldiers , Jun 1995, p. 27 Civilians These last twenty -five years I have worked with civilians very closely, and without that dedicated work force this government of ours would be dead in the water. -SMA William G. Bainbridge , Top Sergeant , 1995, p. 348 When NCOs or civilians must supervise each other, it is very important that they learn each other's personnel system. If you as a civ ilian don't know where to start, see the organization's CSM or senior NCO. Don't wait to learn about the system until you need to know - you need to understand the system before anything comes up. -Mac McCauley , in A Treasury of NCO Quo tations , 1997, no page number The commander's civilian administrative assistant and the CSM need to communicate often. When this relationship is effective, the result will be better support for the commander and the commander's subordinate units. -CSM Jo hn E. Osborne and Ann Kepler , in A Treasury of NCO Quotations , 1997, no page number At every organizational level, a good partnership between the admin officer and the senior NCO of the organization will pay di vidends . -Luticia Hook and MSG Steven L. Boehmer , in A Treasury of NCO Quotations , 1997, no page number Soldiers and civilians working together need to understand each other and understand where each is coming from. By doing this you can help the organization's momentum to grow. -Randy Morron (former NCO) and Cindy Hartzel , in A Treasury of NCO Quotations , 1997, no page number When you supervise soldiers and civilians, treat them both the same. Your attitude towards both should be, \"If you're right, I'll back you, and if you're wrong, then we'll sit down and talk about it.\" Most people want to do a good job, and your job is to help them do it. -John Chada , in A Treasury of NCO Quotations , 1997, no page number All organizations can be made better by being concerned about all members - the Reserve Components, families, veterans, retirees, and civilians . Remember where you came from - everyone was a civilian once, and will be again. Appreciate and recognize their contributions - it will pay dividends in increased teamwork and mission accomplishment. There are many ways to recognize contributions, and most are free. Visit the civilians in your age ncy; do informal, unannounced walk-throughs; and make it a priority to see what your civilians do. The Army can't function without a proud, dedicated Civilian Corps. -Andy Hare , in A Treasury of NCO Quotations , 1997, no page number Veterans and Retirees There is something different in the way [a veteran] carries himself, a sparkle to his eye, a spring to his step...which another soldier will instantly recognize. - SGT Herbert E. Smith , \"They Get Their Men.\" U.S. Army Recruiting News , 1 Sep 1928, p. 6 In regard to the infantry, as long as there are a few old heads you can do what you want with the tails; they are the greatest number, and the return of these men in peace is a noticeable benefit to the nation. -Marshal Maurice de Saxe , My Reveries , 1732, Is not old wine wholesomest, old pippins toothsomest, old wood burn brightest, old linen wash whitest?

It is the excellence of the craftsmanship and the combined inspiratio n of soldiers and leaders. It is the excellence of the training, the quality of the leaders, and the courage of the soldiers. -GEN Donn A. Starry , \"Sergeants' Business.\" Military 1978, p. 9 Young noncommissioned offi cers are the ones who call the shots; it is on their knowledge, initiative, and courage that our success in battle rests. -SMA Glen E. Morrell , \"The NCO: More Vital Than Ever to Readiness.\" ARMY , Oct 1983, p. 28 When the fire f ight has once started it becomes to a great extent a fight of a number of platoons. The platoon is the largest organization which can be controlled by a single leader in action. The platoon commander (lieutenant or sergeant) controls its fire in order to g ain the maximum fire effect and to avoid wasting ammunition. He must try his best to make the fire of his platoon effective, to get it forward, and to support neighboring platoons in their effort to advance.... Individual skill in marksmanship is an advant age in battle only when united with fire discipline and control.... The field of battle is the final test of the instruction, discipline, and efficiency of the fighting force of any army. -Manual for Noncommissioned Officers and Privates of Infantry of th e Army of the United States , 1917, pp. 153, 148, 149 [Points about rushing]: 1. The man who gets up slowly is an easy target. 2. The man who gets up last is usually the last to get down and therefore draws most of the fire of the enemy. 3. The man who shifts about in order to be the better able to spring up, thereby gives notice to the enemy that he will soon be a target. -\"The Instruction of Noncommissioned Officers.\" Infantry , Feb 1917, p. 463 As we started moving to contact I got this feeling in my throat, and began to choke a little bit, because I didn't know what I was getting into. Particularly as a rifleman. I was just more or less following the leader. But once we were fired upon and I managed to get missed, our leaders directed us somewhere to put out that firepower, then I had no qualms whatsoever. All the butterflies went out, and I was just a soldier trying to survive. - SGM Albert Lee Wallace in the Battle of the Bulge, WWII, \"Quarter Century with the Infantry. \" Army Digest , May 1969, p. 38 The infantry...this unglamorous, greathearted fighting machine. -Audie Murphy , To Hell and Back , 1949, p. 8 Communications are your key to control. Once a combat operation is in progress, your ability to communicate measures the amount of control you can exercise over the subordinate elements of your unit. In a fire fight, your ability to communicate usually determines the amount of support (artillery, air, medical, supply) you will get when and where yo u need it.... Your communications equipment is your lifeline in combat; check, test, and inspect it frequently, and particularly before any combat operations.... Don't depend entirely on any one means of communication; plan for alternate, secondary, and em ergency means. -DA Pam 350 -13, Guide for Platoon Sergeants , 1967, p. 37 The shepherd boy David had observed the Philistines for some time and knew their tactics well.... David also knew his own capabilities and those o f his weapon; and he refused to accept the armor that Saul offered him, because he had not tried it. Against the leering giant, who stood before him and ridiculed him because he was young and fair and a mere shepherd boy, David took up his simple slingshot, with which he was tactically and technically proficient. With a clear eye and a steady hand, he fearlessly delivered one lethal blow to the oversized braggart.... Twentieth -century giants can be killed, too. As a compet ent antitanker you probably have had more training for giant -killing than David had. But you might do well to employ some of his tactics. And, of course, it doesn't hurt to have God on your side. -MSG Anton J. Sladeczek and Jane A. 37 Noncommissioned officers...are the heart of the -Marshal Maurice de Saxe , My Reveries , 1732, p. 215 Look at an infantryman's eyes and you can tell how much war he has seen.... I don't make the infantryman look noble, because he couldn't look noble even if he tried. Still there is a certain nobility and dignity in combat soldiers and medical aid m en with dirt in their ears. They are rough and their language gets coarse because they live a life stripped of convention and niceties. Their nobility and dignity come from the way they live unselfishly and risk their lives to help each other. -SGT Bill M auldin , Up Front , 1945, pp. 42, 14- 15 One of the first things that will impress you when you get into your first fire fight will be what an experienced combat veteran has described as \"ordered confusion.\"... Many things happen in t he heat of battle which do not go according to plan. In this respect a maneuver on the battlefield is something like a football game. If everything went exactly according to plan, the offensive team would score a touchdown on every play. Combat 42 When something happens that really disrupts our plans, soldiers say that things are \"snafu.\" Nobody seems to know what's going on up ahead or to the flanks. Communication with other units is out - or more likely hasn't been established. The terrain doesn't seem to match wh at is expected from a study of the map. A couple of landmarks may have been identified - but not where they're supposed to be. If movement is made by truck, traffic may be snarled. Frequently, a change in our plans causes this confusion. Sometimes the enem y forces us to change our plans (he's pretty smart, too) but more often we change our plans to take advantage of a new situation. We do this to surprise the enemy or hit him where he is weakest. This ability to change our plans is one of our greatest stren gths.... You can almost count on it, the weather will be too hot, too cold, too dry, or too wet.... Properly used, the weather can help us. Fog can provide a natural \"smoke screen\" for attacking troops - without benefit of artillery or mortar smoke shells. We can't change the weather but we can make it work for us.... Waiting...the old soldier finds good use for this time. He cleans his weapon or his equipment, makes his position better, or just relaxes.... Make the best use of your time.... Knowledge hel ps you overcome the fear of the unknown. Knowing your stuff helps give you the confidence you need to meet the enemy in battle. Right now in training is the time to learn how to shoot and care for your weapons, what to expect and not expect from your equipment, how to use a compass, how to read a map, how to take advantage of the terrain, how to give yourself and others first aid, and how to keep in top physical shape. These are just a few of the skills that are going to take you through combat, not just to combat. Learning these things will help you develop the confidence that overcomes fear in battle.... Survival in combat in not solely a matter of luck. Doing things the right way is more important than luck in coming through a battle alive. And training teaches you to do things the right way.... It's training that defeats the enemy and saves lives. -SMA William O. Wooldridge , \"So You're Headed for Combat.\" Army Digest , Jan 1968, pp. 6- 11 Russian Field Service Regulations : Even though you perish, help your comrade. Forward against the enemy even though the lines that have preceded you have been defeated. If you have no fear of death you will surely be victorious. If your task is hard, that of the enemy is not easier, perhaps even more difficult than yours. You only see your own difficulties and not those of the enemy, which certainly exist. Therefore, never despair, but always be bold and stubborn. On the defensive one must not parry only but, at the first opportunity, strike. The best method of defense is to attack. In a fight, he is victorious who is the more stubborn and daring, not he who is clever and strong. Victory is not achieved by a single effort; the enemy has also learned to be steadfast; sometimes a second and third effort is not successful; under such circumstances one must make a fourth attempt and, if necessary, others until victory is achieved. Clever dispositions make easy the achievement of a particular task with the smallest possible losses, but the y only help. He only reaches his goal who is determined to die rather than fail. Whatever the obstacles on the road to success may be, your only thought should be how to overcome them. You must not permit yourself to think that they cannot be overcome. A good troop has neither rear nor flanks but only a front, which meets the enemy from whatever direction he may come. Should the enemy appear however unexpectedly, one must not forget that he can be defeated either with the bayonet or by fire. It is not difficult to choose. Your formation is a secondary consideration. When the enemy is close, always use the bayonet; when he is distant first use fire, later the bayonet. There is no situation from which one cannot issue with honor. In battle, troops are not relieved. When you have become engaged in a fight you must remain in it to the end. You will be reinforced but not relieved. During battle, help only your fighting comrades; after the defeat of the enemy, think of the wounded. He who worries about the wounded during a fight and leaves his place to help them is a coward and not a merciful man. There are always special detachments for the care of the wounded. If you are a leader, do not interfere with the affairs of your subordinates when you see they are well performed. He who troubles himself with the affairs of others neglects his own. Every superior and subordinate must be permitted independence and responsibility in his province; if the former is not conceded, the latter falls from him also. A superior should see that all do their duty. In this respect he must not be indulgent. - \"Battle Maxims for the Russian Soldier.\" Infantry , Feb 1917, p. 469 Combat Power Although he lost several battles, Frederick [the Great] was a military genius, which accounted in part for his success.

He should ask himself repeatedly these pointed leadership questions: -Are my actions increasing or decreasing my unit's cohesion and effectiveness? -Are my actions contributing to confident or despairing attitudes among m y men? -Are my actions really contributing to my unit's effectiveness, or am I throwing up a smoke screen to make it appear that way? He should ask himself these questions not only about his own behavior, but about the behavior of other combat leaders so that he can learn from their strong and weak points. -1SG Walter D. Stock , \"Leading to Confidence.\" Infantry , May -Jun 1978, p. 26 One thing we've always done in the infantry - we never let one man do all the thinking. We always listen to any individual who wants to offer advice. We may not agree with it, but we listen to him. After all, this is his life too. He's going out there with you, and I've always maintained that two or three heads are better than one. Prior to an attack - if time permits - I ask some of the men, \"How would you do it?\" You'll have a better rifle team going out with you than if you just say \"Okay, you go here, you go there, you do this...\" We let this private walk through the door right along with our leaders and that way he feels part of the team and feels he had something to do with the development of the operation order. -SGM Albert Lee Wallace , \"Quarter Century with the Infantry.\" Army Digest , May 1969, p. 41 It would be wron g to hazard an engagement, if the old experienced soldiers testify to a disinclination to fight. - Vegetius , The Military Institutions of the Romans , 390 AD, p. 152 \"Let's Go\"...is a challenge to action...breathes decision and confidence... embodies an invitation, which is stronger than compulsion, without in the least weakening disciplinary authority [and] expresses unity of purpose. -The Old Sergeant's Conferences , 1930, pp. 128, 129 When his unit was ordered to fall back, [CPL Charles L.] Gilliland covered the withdrawal. He lost his life making certain his fellow soldiers made good their escape. He received the Medal of Honor posthumously for demonstrating that leadership not only means Combat 44 \"follow me\" - someti mes it means being the last one out. -SFC Frank Cox , \"The NCO Corps.\" Soldiers , May 1989, p. 10 Come on, you sons of bitches - do you want to live forever? -Gunnery SGT Dan Daly to members of his platoon, WWI, in At Belleau Wood, p. 173 Decision -making in Combat [With war being in some ways like chess] if you're a smart player, you're thinking two or three moves ahead; you've anticipated the enemy action and you're preparing your own offensive counterthr ust.... \"You've got to be thinking, 'What if?'\" said [LTC Clayton Melton ]. \"If I were attacking, what would I do?\" For the leader who doesn't consider the answers to those questions...the reply might be short and to the point. Checkmate. -SGT William H. McMichael , \"The Human Chess Game.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1988, p. 42 You want to make sure, since you're dealing with people's lives, you don't make hasty decisions. Every decision you make or order you give in combat is of the split- second type. You'd be surprised how much time three seconds is in making a decision. -SGM Albert Lee Wallace , \"Quarter Century with the Infantry.\" Army Digest , May 1969, p. 39 The effectiveness of maneuver, fire power, and protection depends on how well leaders combine tactics, techniques, and procedures to meet the realities of mission, enemy, terrain, and troops available. Leaders must recognize inherent advantages and disadvantages in order to think ahead, develop alternative courses of action, evaluate those courses of action, and take the initiative. -NCOPD Study , Vol 1, 1986, p. 206 As an NCO, you have to make split -second decisions. When you're a combat -oriented NCO, you don't have to stop and think- you're thinking all the time. -MSG Roy Benavidez , in \"MSG (Ret) Roy Benavidez : A Real American Hero.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1996, p. 11 Initiative in Combat Anyone who has experienced batt le knows that there is no such thing as a discipline that takes the place of individual effort. -RSM John Holbrook , in On the Word of Command, 1990, p. 153 During mock battles in the NTC's Mojave Desert, quality training results in senior NCOs taking charge in the absence of orders. Often it's the NCOs' initiative that determines the outcome of the battle. For the most part, senior NCOs are ready and able to execute without specific instructions. Unfortunately, commanders too often fail to get the mission down to them. It has been my experience that junior NCOs are ready to take charge when superiors neglect to issue orders. At the NTC, good NCOs automatically ensure that soldiers complete range and sector sketch cards, and that they assume good hasty fighting positions. Too often, soldiers have to move out of these positions when their NCOs are told to take up new locations.... If the NCOs were in on the planning process, those moves might not be necessary.... After more than 100 NTC rotations and hundreds of company - and platoon -level after action reviews, we continue to get the same feedback from the NCO Corps - when NCOs are left out of mission planning, the mission is affected negatively. The AARs also reveal two other recurrin g messages: Operations orders often lack sufficient details to allow for mission planning, and leaders do not have enough time after receipt of orders to rehearse the mission. -CSM Jerry T. Alley , \"The NTC Challenge.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1991, pp. 12- 13 At the National Training Center...a big difference on results is obtained when weapons fail, things break down, things go wrong, and the soldiers find alternative ways. -a FORSCOM CDR, quoted by CSM Joshua Perry , \"Regimental Command Sergeant Major.\" Military Police , Apr 1989, p. 3 Determination in Combat It is by the fighting man's determination and \"guts\" that the enemy is conquered in close combat. It is this man, more than the machines of war, who bri ngs success in battle. -The Noncom's Guide , 1954, p. 62 When one reporter asked how the soldiers endured the cold and went sleepless to complete the bridge [over the Sava River between Croatia and Bosnia- Herzegovina], SSG Robert Butcher ...said that the soldiers... weren't going to let the river win . -GEN Dennis J. Reimer , \"CSA Counts on NCOs to Keep the Spirit Alive.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1996, p. 4 An attack must be well planned, well constructed and vigorously pushed. Once it has been set into motion there is no turning back without heavy losses. -Non- Commissioned Officer's Tools , no date, p. 12 A few men judiciously placed and acting with resolution may detain a large body of the enemy for some tim e.... Experience has taught that a body of troops on landing are always in some sort of disorder at first, and the spirited conduct of a few cool and determined individuals will increase the same to an astonishing Combat 45 degree. -Hints for Non -Commissioned Offic ers on Actual Service , 1804, p. 16, 17 Keeping Cool An Infantry leader can [teach soldiers] about the physical effects of fear. If each soldier can learn how he feels when he is afraid, then his fear in combat will not be totally unfamiliar. -1SG Walte r D. Stock , May -Jun 1978, pp. 24- 25 Try to keep cool because the [enemy] may be more scared than you. -WWII gunner, in What the Soldier Thinks: A Monthly Digest of War Department Studies on the Attitudes of American Troops , Aug 1944, p. 10 Prior to a battle such as [the Battle of the Bulge], what is done with a man who is showing extreme tension? There's always something you can kid any individual about. In a situation like that, you can usual ly look around and sense who's having problems. Someone will go over and start talking to him. The main thing is to get him talking and to loosen up and this usually takes care of him. If you can't kid him you generally ask about his family, where he's fro m and how he got involved in the war.... We never degrade anyone for this. It's not a crime. It's nothing to be ashamed of just because a man has fear. This is part of life. But you can get that man off to the side and give him some self -confidence.... But...once that man is in the battle and that first round goes off, he's a veteran and he acts like one from there on out. -SGM Albert Lee Wallace , \"Quarter Century with the Infantry.\" Army Digest , May 1969, p. 39 The greatest peril of the jungle is panic. The hardiest of men, upon finding themselves cast into a jungle, are subject to a certain degree of shock. The first thing...to do is to sit down, take stock of the situation, inventory the survival equipment on hand, and work out a plan of action. -MSG W. F. Fitzgerald , \"Training for Jungle Survival.\" Army Information Digest , May 1951, p. 18 What to do if lost. First of all, don't lose your head - keep cool - try not to let your brains get into your feet. By this we mean don't run around and make things worse, and play yourself out. To begin with, sit down and think; cool off. Then climb a tree, or hill, and endeavor to locate some familiar object.... If you find a stream, follow it; it will generally lead somewhere- where civilization exists. -Noncommissioned Officers' Manual , 1917, p. 233 According to Polybius [c. 200 BC], the men the Romans chose as their centurions were those who could keep cool in an emergency. -The Army of the Caesars, p. xxxiii How can fear help you? Fear is not altogether undesirable. It is nature's way of preparing your body for battle. As a consequence, the body automatically undergoes certain changes. You may temporarily lose a sense of fatigue, no matter h ow tired you are.... Fear...can stimulate your body, make you more alert, and prepare you for unusual physical effort.... One of the easiest things to do is to talk to someone. Talk is a convenient way to relieve your tension - and it also helps the men yo u're talking to.... It's a reminder that the rest of the team is with you. Your confidence goes up and your fear goes down when you think of the coming fight as a team job. You know the striking power of the team.... Action or \"doing something\" will also help you overcome the initial paralyzing effect of fear in combat. This is especially true when you're waiting for battle and the suspense is bothering you. Put your fear aside by doing something- even if you have to make work for yourself.... The act of firing not only helps you overcome fear but it also helps defeat the enemy.... No man ever adjusts himself perfectly to battle, regardless of how much combat he's seen. Veteran soldiers also experience [the] reactions caused by fear. The difference is that veterans have learned to control their fears betters than green troops.... Learn to control [fear] and make it work for you.... The man who controls his fear and goes about his business despite it is a courageous man. There's no limit to what courage can accomplish on the battlefield. - SMA William O. Wooldridge , \"So You're Headed for Combat.\" Army Digest , Jan 1968, pp. 10- 11 [Tips on controlling fear]: 1. Recognize fear early- When your heart begins to pound and your pulse begins to race- and there is a sinking feeling in your stomach- when you break out in a cold sweat - and your mouth is dryer than the Sahara - when these things happen you can say to yourself: \"I'm getting scared.\" But it's nothing to be ashamed about. Controlled fear is useful because it prevents you from being either reckless or yellow. As soon as you know you're afraid, you're ready for the next step. But if you don't admit you're scared before you get panicky, it's too late. 2. Get ready in advance to meet danger - Keep on figuring to yourself how you will meet the different kinds of danger you will soon be facing. This is one of the biggest helps in controlling combat fear. Your whole military training has prepared you for this. If you figure out wha t to do ahead of time, you'll be ready to act when necessary. 3. Remember that being scared makes you a smarter soldier - and a safer one - Fear tightens you up and makes you more ready for anything. If you control it, Combat 46 fear makes you smarter, stronger, quicker - and therefore safer in any situation. 4. If you're scared before combat, talk about it - Everyone is afraid in combat. You're no exception, and neither are the rest of the men in your outfit. Talking about it reduces fear, helps to avoid feelings of g uilt at being afraid, and makes the frightened man feel less of a \"special case.\" Of the Americans in the Spanish Civil War, the great majority said that talking about their fear made them better soldiers. They got it off their chests and then went to work. 5. Never show signs of fear in combat - If you go into a panic, the other men near you may be scared enough to follow your example. Remember that you belong to a team, and other men are depending on you. You will have to take risks to help your buddy; he will do the same for you. Veterans also stress that coolness is contagious. If one man behaves calmly in a dangerous situation, the sight is a tonic to the others. What they need is leadership by example- it helps them to do their job better. 6. Don't fo rget the enemy is scared of you - Put yourself in the enemy's shoes. The enemy is human, too, and at least as scared as you are, if not more so. If you have the idea you're fighting supermen, just look at the prisoners. 7. Make a wisecrack- A joke in the f ace of danger is useful because it relieves the tension. It will increase your own coolness and give the others something else to think about besides danger signals. One of the best ways to take men's minds off useless fear is to make them relax for a moment, then bring them back to concentrating on the job at hand. 8. Concentrate on the job at hand- Most of the veterans found that concentrating on their job made them less afraid. Exertion of any kind tended to occupy their minds and drive out fear because they had less time to think of what might happen. A general rule is: \"When fear is strong, keep your mind on the job at hand.\" -300 American veterans of the Spanish Civil War, Ordnance Noncom's Handbook , 1944, p. 6 Surprise Query No. 1. What is a surp rise? Answer. To come upon an enemy who is negligent (either by stratagem or treachery) in such a manner that he is not able to get in a proper state of defense. Q.2. What time is generally chosen for surprises? A. Midnight or before day -light. Q. 3. Why at those times? A. In the night men are apt to get timorous, and if asleep and suddenly wakened they think rather of saving their lives by flight than by defending themselves, and under such circumstances a few men may defeat a great number. Q. 4. Is the re no instance in which a surprise may be attempted in broad day? A. Yes, when there is a certainty of the enemy being so negligent, that he confides in the daylight, and permits his officers to ride about and the men to maraude. [On a n ambush] the first party of the ambuscade suffers the enemy to pass; the other party, who is to attack him in front, suffers him to advance so near, that he cannot miss his aim when he fires: upon levelling on the enemy he should be called to - Dismount, or we shall fire, you are cut off . Should the enemy, by this sudden surprise, dismount, the party in its rear advances - surrounds the enemy, with loud cries to increase their fears - disarms them - links the horses - and retreats in the most concealed and speedy manner. -Hints for Non - Commissioned Officers on Actual Service , 1804, pp. 68- 69, 75- 76 A surprise has no apology. -Customs of Service for Non - Commissioned Officers and Soldiers , 1865, p. 128 Keeping Dispersed Death loves a crowd. -SGM Tim Gowing , Crimean War, in On the Word of Command, p. 32 If my nose had been a shovel I'd have been speaking Chinese in another five minutes. -SGT R. C. Billington , after being shelled during WWII, The G.I. Journal of Sergeant Giles , p. 39 You never want to get so involved with a stricken man that you stop putting out that firepower. We are taught the principles of first aid but we have a medic with us. If a buddy is shot down next to me, I continue to observe the enemy while hollering for the medic. If none is available I'll designate one man to go over and try and stop the blood until a medic arrives.... We've lost quite a few men huddling around a wounded man. -SGM Albert Lee Wallace , \"Quarter Century with the Infantry.\" Army Digest , May 1969, p. 40 Safety in Combat I've seen [the risk assessment card] used in peace and in battle. It's in combat where the big payoff comes, but it works anytime, anywhere. -SGM John Chavez , in \"Force Protection - It's in the Cards.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, p. 9 Soldiers will often ignore some of the more basic safety measures, rationalizing that \"it's a war -zone,\" and that different rules apply. Concerned leaders [in Desert Storm] ensured that this misconception quickly dissipated.... Soldiers have a tendency to sleep anywhere, especially when the unit is on the move, and NCOs had to constantly check for soldiers sleeping near vehicles (or in the cab of running vehicles - carbon Combat 47 monoxide danger). -MSG Gregory A. Drake , in Personal Perspectives on the Gulf War , 1993, pp. 21- 22 Desert Warfare War in the desert is often described as a \"war of water,\" with victory going to the side that conserves and uses its available water wisely.... Lack of water threatens the life of every living thing in the desert, but the dangers there are not all physical. \"An oppressive feeling of immense loneliness overcomes everyone more or less frequently in the desert, a feeling that one is cut off from everything one holds dear,\" wrote World War II veteran, German Generalmajor Alfred Toppe. Leaders, according to Toppe, \"must recognize such moods and depressions and offer sincere encouragement so that pressure will disappear.\"... Newcomers to the desert often say it seems that they can \"see forever.\" More experienced soldiers might describe it as seeing the world through a full goldfish bowl. Objects seem closer than they are, shapes dis tort, and important terrain features disappear entirely. The shimmer of heat on sand creates mirages of water or hills in the distance. There are accounts from World War II of lost soldiers walking for days toward mountains that did not exist.... Heat is the most obvious and immediate physical danger in a desert environment. During World War II, air temperatures in the Sahara Desert often reached 136 degrees Fahrenheit. Inside their tanks crews recorded temperatures of 160 degrees. Soldiers in all desert w ars have gone without hats and shirts in the mid -day sun, thus losing valuable cooling perspiration and becoming heat stroke victims. Other have fallen victim to dehydration when they didn't force themselves to drink at regular intervals. Both are problems that can be attributed to lack of NCO supervision.... Lack of vegetation and prominent terrain features in the desert make pinpointing one's position extremely difficult, even during daylight hours. NCOs must train their soldiers to use their compasses, to accurately measure distances traveled, and to navigate in a land nearly void of man -made and natural terrain features. Experience gained at the NTC has shown that, although their map reading skills are adequate for the training areas near their home bas es, soldiers in the desert may either become disoriented or be forced to hug the roads and dry streambeds for fear of getting lost. Many units now have more sophisticated land navigation or location determination equipment than the standard compass and map can provide. Unfortunately, the soldiers of such units sometimes become too reliant on these means and allow their map reading skills to slip. Satellite links, electronic or other equipment can be lost in battle or [be] unavailable, and overdependence on any one method of land navigation or location identification system can lead to disaster. The best -led soldiers are those who can use available systems...yet fall back on sound map reading skills when necessary. -SFC John K. D'Amato , \"School of Sand: Desert Lessons.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1991, pp. 10, 9 Survival, Escape, and Evasion The most important thing the Army can teach its soldiers about captivity is that they are stronger than the enemy if they stick together.... If soldiers stay together in every way, take care of their sick and weak, buck each other up when the going gets rough, and resist the enemy in every way, he won't be able to brainwash or convert any one of them.... A man who is captured should remember he is s till capable of fighting back even though he is a prisoner and no longer has his weapons. No matter how small a thing may seem, if he will go ahead and do it against the enemy, it may develop into something big.... The soldier who allows himself to be indo ctrinated not only lets down his country, but he doesn't even win any respect from the enemy. -SFC Lloyd C. Pate , \"Survival Lies in Training.\" ARMY , Apr 1956, pp. 48, 50 The habit of continually studying terrain before, as well as after, capture cannot be stressed too highly. Constant terrain study will increase the chances of effecting a successful escape.... When you are first disarmed by the enemy, you probably will be close enough to the front to reach safety a short time after escape. But as you move to the rear the chances of successful escape diminish with each additional yard of enemy territory covered. Therefore you should become escape- conscious at once. The next incoming shell or burst of gunfire may force your captor to seek cover - to throw himself on the ground, or perform some similar instinctive action. Watch your chances; when this happens get away fast - this is the time to run.... Contrary to widespread belief, a slight wound is sometimes an advantage when captured . Even a small cut or scratch can be dramatized into an apparently disabling wound by forcing it to bleed freely into the bandage, then reversing the dressing so that it looks worse than it is. It will require very little acting ability to pretend that the wound has drained your strength, that you are dazed and exhausted - and in no condition to escape. Successful escapes have been made through this ruse. The guard is inclined to discount the possibility of escape by an obviously wounded prisoner. Also, when escape is made under such circumstances, search normally will be concentrated in the immediate area of escape, under the assumption that a wounded prisoner cannot travel far or fast. So get away as far and as fast as you can. -MSG James F. Quinn , \"Evasion and Escape.\" Infantry , Apr 1957, p. 69 Combat 48 There are three keys to survival [as a POW]: organization, knowledge of survival techniques peculiar to imprisonment, and mutual trust with resultant discipline.... The goal must be to crea te continuous and wholehearted cooperation within the group. Every action should add to discipline and pride, for discipline here can be only voluntary.... Good morale is necessary. The commander must deliberately sustain it. Certain chosen representatives must be made to feel that the spirit of the group is their direct responsibility . Humor is an effective tool; persuasion, optimism, prayer, and songs will play an important part. -SFC Fred H. Bost , \"To Live as a P.O.W.\" Infantry , Mar-Apr 1965, p. 43- 44 There isn't a man in the world who can't be broken. The important thing was not to give up the first time. Those who made it tougher each time were sooner or later left alone.... You just have to believe in what you do. You have to be able to live with yourself when it's all over.... Over the years, you begin to remember the good things. -MSG John Anderson, in \"Five Years of 'Hanoi Hilton': A Former POW Looks Back.\" ARMY , May 1983, pp. 28, 29 If you're ever captured, you have to be ready to handle it. Read the Code of Conduct. Understand it. Have faith in your fellow prisoners. Believe that your government will come after you some way, somehow. Eat whatever your captors give you; you've got to keep your , , Dec 1988, p. 36 I'd have never survived or escaped [as a POW] if I hadn't kept myself physically fit, mentally alert, and spiritually sound.... When we were together on de tails I'd tell the guys, \"don't forget to pray.\"... When you're a POW you always think of ways to escape, then take the opportunity when it comes. In the meantime, I counted the bars on my cage or drew pictures in the dirt. I sang, weaved bamboo or worked math problems.... The smallest victory gave me new life. -SGM Isaac Camacho , in \"Faith, Courage, Determination Meant Escape and Survival.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1993, p. 9 Nobody needs to starve in the jungle.... There is always adequate sustenance within easy walking distance but it has to be recognized before it can be exploited. However, the jungle does not cater to clientele with prejudiced palates... \"Remember, anything a monkey eats, a man can eat.\" -MSG W. F. Fitzgerald , \"Training for Jungle Survival.\" Army Information Digest , May 1951, pp. 18, 22 Support in Combat Soldiers must be absolutely confident that no matter what happens to them, they can always depend on their unit to support them.... During combat, the leader can build on this foundation of group cohesion to structure the situation. A soldier's greatest need when he is in contact with an enemy is to have some kind of structure in his situation. -1SG Walter D. Stock , \"Leading to Confidence.\" Infantry , May -Jun 1978, p. 23 When you're in the Army, you can be in the infantry at any given moment. -SGT Michael Davis , in \"Sergeants on Training.\" Sergeants' Business 13 I have heard [President William] McKinley say that the experience he got in the Civil War [as a Quartermaster - Sergeant] and from which he came out an officer, was the most valuable experience and training he had had in all his life. -\"Talks by the 'Old Man.' \" National Guard, Jun 1915, p. 113 When we first heard the planes and turned to look, just as far as you could see the sky was full of them - they just didn't quit, wave after wave after wave coming in, as far back as you could see.... God, but they were beautiful. -SGT Henry Giles , WWII, The G.I. Journal of Sergeant Giles , p. 62 Army Aviation means many things to many soldiers: -To the front line ground combat soldiers it m eans rapid transportation over difficult terrain to the battle. -To the soldiers in a fire fight it means the delivery of pinpoint accurate, devastating fire support. -To soldiers in a tank battle it means the delivery of deadly antitank fire. -To soldi ers serving at isolated outposts it means a life line and communications. -To war fighting units it means resupply and replacement of critical food, water, fuel, ammunition, and soldiers. -To the wounded soldier it could mean the difference between life and death. -SMA Julius W. Gates , \"U.S. Army Aviation: Dedicated, Courageous Soldiers.\" Army Aviation , 31 Jan 1989, p. 3 Them old boys at the front have sure got my sympathy. Least we can do is work our fingers off to give them the stuff. -CPL Herschel Grimsley , Ordnance Repairman, WWII, Ernie's War, p. 320 There are very few things in combat that will destroy morale faster than poor logistical support. -CSM Bob L. Williams , \"The Sergeant Major.\" Infantry , Sep -Oct 1969, p. 19 Supply is the key to winning, but we must be able to fight the supplies through to where the victory is won. - SSG Gilbert Warner , \"Defending the LCU's.\" A rmy Logistician , May -Jun 1991, p. 33 In combat, as in garrison, company administration remains a big responsibility for you - the first sergeant.... Combat 49 In your training more than once you heard it said authoritatively that administration within the company stops upon entry into combat. Don't believe it. When you go into combat, administration will take on a new and important meaning. Speed is the keynote. Never put off even for an hour any job that you can accomplish at the time. It can make a big difference to the men under you.... It's been a hard day. The shells have fallen thick and fast and not too damn far away from you. Sure you're tired, but don't forget it's getting late and your reports will soon be due at battalion.... First, fill in your casualty forms. Give these priority over the morning report because you want those wounded, killed, and missing men's families to be notified of their status as soon as possible.... With the casualty forms finished go on to your morning report. For your station, as k the communication sergeant for the coordinates of your CP and the direction and distance it is from the nearest town. Be accurate and colorful in your record of events - it's likely to be the basis for the history of your unit. - 1SG Walter R. Sledge , WWII, \"For First Sergeants Only.\" Infantry , Dec 1944, pp. 28, 27 Maintenance in Combat The first thing S GT [Bazzel Carter did every morning was to] start the engines of his tank...to make sure everything was in readiness for a sudden mission. After breakfast he showed me all through his tank. It was so spotless you could have eaten off the floor. He was very proud of it, and had me sit in the driver's seat and start the engines to hear them sing. -Ernie Pyle, WWII, Brave Men, p. 263 We exercised the guns and we knew when things weren't right.... If that howitzer sounded different I could tell by the sound alone. I may not have known what was wrong, but I knew we had to start looking.... Maintenance is critical to combat success. There's a temptation to brush off maintenance when it's \"only for training.\" When it's \"only for training,\" if you break down maintenance comes by and you sit there until it gets fixed. In Saudi Arabia, you break down, you're left behind because the majority of the force is gonna keep on moving. We finished the battle with 23 of our 24 artillery pieces, which is a pretty good record. -SFC Larry Ingram , \"Moving Beyond Victory.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1991, p. 16 If you tell soldiers their lives depend on how well their equipment runs, they pay a little more attention. They baby that equipment.... Sandstorms were a major problem [in Desert Storm]. Without goggles, your eyes get destroyed. The s and meant we had to pay extra attention to detail. When you look over your equipment, everything may seem okay. But underneath, if you didn't clean that breather screen every day, you were in big trouble. -MSG Earl Shelley , \"Moving Beyond Victory.\" NCO Journal , Summer 1991, p. 16 Equipment seems to break just when it's needed. This is especially true with communications equipment. One minute a communications check with the platoon leader is successful and the next minute you can't reach anybody. Most of the time, good operator PMCS will prevent this from happening. -SFC Lawrence Kordosky , \"OREs Just Tools of the Trade.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1995, p. 18 The enemy, which could be seen all around, quickly went on the offensive, attacking vital components of the 3rd ACR's equipment.... As fine as talcum powder, the sand worked its way into air and fuel filters, choking the power from engines. Additionally, the sand made for a difficult driving surface, sometimes prying tank tracks from road wheels and placing a greater strain on vehicle transmissions.... Fortunately, the maintenance troopers were prepared for the foe and met the...assault with success. [The Support Troop, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment's] success in Operation Desert Storm depended on its repairers, not the number of spare parts. -SGT Michael P. , \"A Sandy Enemy.\" Ordnance , May 1991, pp. 12, 13 Rations in Combat Rations have a whole lot to do with it too.

[Hospital stewards and hospital soldiers] are subject to the same conditions of subordination and discipline, and differ from other enlisted men only in the nature of their duties. They are equipped as infantry, excepting when serving in the field with cavalry or l ight artillery, when they are mounted, but they carry no offensive weapons. They are armed with a large knife, and one -fourth of them carry a medicine case.... Besides their duties in -doors they are drilled in the use of litters and ambulances, which invol ves the careful and expeditious transportation of a wounded man from the place of casualty to the bed of the hospital. These drills in and out of doors are carried out with the precision and attention to detail that mark other military exercises. - The Arm ies of To -Day, 1893, pp. 15, 16 The idea of women playing a role in the British armed forces first occurred to a cavalryman as he lay wounded on the battlefield under a hot African sun in the Sudan [c. 1898]. Sergeant -Major Edward Charles Baker , whether in a moment of delirium or percipience, envisaged a troop of graceful young ladies galloping side-saddle to his rescue, lifting him tenderly on to a stretcher and transporting him back to safety....

The lines at times were so near each other that the hostile gun barrels almost touched.... Our line is pressed so far that our dead are within the lines of the enemy. The pressure made by the superior weight of the enemy's lines is severely felt. Our ammunition is nearly all gone, and we are using the cartridges from the boxes of our wounded comrades. A critical moment has arr ived, and we can remain as we are no longer; we must advance or retreat. It must not be the latter, but how can it be the former? Colonel Chamberlain understands how it can be done. The order is given \"Fix bayonets!\" and the st eel shanks of the bayonets rattle upon the rifle barrels. \"Charge bayonets, charge!\" Every man understood in a moment that the movement was our only salvation, but there is a limit to human endurance, and I do not dishonor those brave men when I write that for a brief moment the order was not obeyed, and the little line seemed to quail under the fearful fire that was being poured upon it. O for some man reckless of life, and all else save his country's honor and safety, who would rush far out to the front, lead the way, and inspire the hearts of his exhausted comrades! In that moment of supreme need the want was supplied. Lieut. H. S. Melcher , an officer who had worked his way up from the ranks, and was then in command of Co. F., at t hat time the color company, saw the situation and did not hesitate, and for his gallant act deserved as much as any other man of the honor of the victory on Round Top. With a cheer, and a flash of his sword, that sent an inspiration along the line, full te n paces to the front he sprang - ten paces - more than half the distance between the hostile lines. \"Come on! Come on! Come on, boys!\" he shouts. The color sergeant and the brave color guard follow, and with one wild yell of anguish wrung from its tortured h eart, the regiment charged. -Theodore Gerrish , 20th Maine Volunteers, 2 July 1863, Civil War, in Rank and File , pp. 324-325 Discussions of leadership are apt to dwell upon such people as George Washington and Robert E. Lee and George Patton and Admiral Nelson and Admiral Nimitz and General Doolittle. Not many of us need to prepare for their jobs. The leader I prefer to consider is the Combat 51 sergeant who must get his squad up a knife -edged ridge to an enemy bunker; the commander of a small craft who must cross a reef and touch down exactly in the right spot on a blazing beac h; the airplane pilot who must take his plane through the middle of terrific flak straight to the objective while paratroopers go out the door.

At Valhey tanks from his Company A rolled into the center of town, led by the company com mander, Captain William Spencer , in the first tank. Commanding the second tank in the column was Sergeant Joseph Sadowski . The lead tank swung north around a corner as Sadowski clattered into the village square. There a German armor -piercing round from an 88mm antitank gun scored a direct hit on his tank, catching it in the flank and setting it afire. The doomed vehicle lurched to a halt next to the town's water trough as the f lames built in intensity. Sadowski ordered his crew to dismount and got them to shelter against a nearby building, dodging a hail of machine -gun and small -arms fire as they ran across the square. Then, taking a count, he discove red that the tank's bow gunner was not with him. Looking at the crippled tank, Sadowski saw that the man's hatch was still shut tight. What happened next is indelibly inscribed in the division's history: \"The sergeant ran back t o his tank, clambered up the smoking front slope plate and tried to pry open the bow gunner's hatch with his bare hands. He stood on the smoking tank and strained at the hatch until he had been hit so many times he could no longer stand. He slid from his m edium and died in the mud beside its tracks.\" Altogether eight antitank guns and some three hundred German infantry had been defending Valhey. After the town was cleared the attacking force swirled on east toward Moncourt, and it was four days before anyo ne could be sent back to Valhey to recover Sadowski's body. There they found that the local townspeople had buried him in their local cemetery, his grave heaped with flowers. The next day, under a pouring rain, the entire population of the village stood in a silent tribute as the fallen tanker's body was removed for transfer to a military cemetery. Abrams never forgot Sadowski , or the selfless actions that won him the Medal of Honor that day. Often h e would speak of him as an exemplar of a leader's devotion to his men. He could never do so without a husky throat and a catch in his voice, communicating more eloquently than his words how he felt about such a soldier. [Later, taking over a battalion on occupation duty in Germany that needed some bucking up,] Abrams assembled the whole outfit in the post theater. There he explained to them about how Sergeant Sadowski had won the Medal of Honor in W orld War II, winding up with a charge to these soldiers of the postwar Army.... \"You people are in the same Army, with the same traditions. Remember when you walk through the streets of Chemnitz and Grafenwoehr that you walk with Sergeant Sadowski .\" -Lewis Sorley , Thunderbolt: General Creighton , pp. 58-59, 110 CPL -generation Japanese- American [received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Korean War, as part of Company Combat 52 H, 2nd Bn, 7th Inf Regiment.] His citation reads in part: ...Company H was occupying a defensive position when the enemy fanatically attacked, threateni ng to overrun the position. CPL Miyamura , a machine- gun squad leader, aware of the imminent danger to his men, unhesitatingly jumped from his shelter wielding his bayonet in close hand -to-hand combat killing approximately 10 of the enemy. Returning to his position, he administered first aid to the wounded and directed their evacuation. As another savage assault hit the line, he manned his machine -gun and delivered withering fire until his ammunition was expended. He ordered th e squad to withdraw while he stayed behind to render the gun inoperative. He then bayoneted his way through infiltrated enemy soldiers to a second gun emplacement and assisted in its operation. When the intensity of the attack necessitated the withdrawal o f the company, CPL Miyamura ordered his men to fall back while he remained to cover their movement. He killed more than 50 of the enemy before his ammunition was depleted and he was severely wounded. He maintained his magnifi cent stand despite his painful wounds, continuing to repel the attack until his position was overrun. When last seen he was fighting ferociously against an overwhelming number of enemy soldiers.... Miyamura was captured and s pent 28 months in a POW camp. -\"Brave Medal of Honor Recipient Was Native of Gallup, New Mexico.\" NCO Journal , Winter 1997, inside back cover DUNCAN- What bloody man is that?

His company followed his lead up the wall, hauling up their rifles and ammunition belts by a rope made with rifle sling s. For his daring example, Corporal Titus ...received the Medal of Honor. -The Story of the Noncommissioned Officer Corps , p. 218 One of the gallant incidents which thrilled the country, and Scotland particularly, was the remark able courage displayed by Piper George Findlater , of The Gordon Highlanders, during the Tirah Campaign in 1897. The fighting took place against the Afridis on the North - West Frontier of India, and early in the attack on the wellnigh impregnable heights at Dargai, on 20th October, Findlater was wounded in both legs by rifle fire. He sank to the ground with blood streaming from his wounds, but continued playing Scottish warlike tunes on his pipes, which gave great encouragement and determination to his comrades as they crossed the bullet - swept ground. Efforts were made to remove him to a place of safety where his wounds could receive attention, but he refused all offers until the heights had been won. In recognition of his devotion to duty he was awarded the Victoria Cross. One of the tunes played on that memorable occasion was the well -known \"Cock o' the North,\" which has since been adopted by The Gordon Highlanders as their Regimental March. Thus a simple tune perpetuates the memory of a very fine episode in the history of the Regiment. -MAJ T. J.

Civilian education certainly enhances the individual's personal and professional value and especially the NCOs.... We aren't talking about an entry on a service record. We're talking about an individual acquiring more tools which will assist in daily living and certainly in the performance of military duties. -SMA Leon L. Van Autreve , \"Walking Tall - and Eager.\" Soldiers , Feb 1974, p. 33 Professional Development 57 [Comments from Division CSMs on the value of education]: The value of education increases when the NCO increases in rank and responsibility....

The more education an individual has means a more professional product. -NCOPD Study , Vol 2, 1986, pp. L -4-110, 111 A vital part of professional development is education.

Morrell , \"Reaching for Excellence.\" Sergeants' Business , Nov -Dec 1986, p. 5 Educational skills increase capacity and motivation to learn more. They encourage vision, imagination, and originality. These skills emphasize how to think rather than what to think.... Education enhanc es competence and normally leads to job satisfaction and retention. - FM 22 -600-20, The Army Noncommissioned Officer Guide , 1986, p. 35 If you want to pursue a civilian education, usually you can find the time, and there are ways. You'll find them - as eas ily as you'd find time to go down -town and look at a new car you want to buy; as easily as you find time to go on a Rhine cruise, or take leave and go someplace. You can find the time - it's just a question of priorities. - CSM George L. Horvath , \"Focus on NCOs.\" EurArmy , Aug 1989, p. 9 Education and a diploma are the keys to success.... Every time I approach a school audience I see the faces of the children that my fellow soldiers fought and died for. I must admit, however, tha t what I am now seeing in many of those eyes shocks me. I learn of dropout rates in schools...that approach seventy -five percent. When I address these students I see poverty. Not just poverty of finances but poverty of values, morals, and purpose. It...bre aks my heart. -MSG Roy Benavidez , Medal of Honor , 1995, p. 172 Why You Should Read When you read to grow, that is to say, for self - development, you will study what you read. You will find yourself trying new concepts and ideas. You will remove limitations you have put on yourself and you will find the challenge of leading more interesting and rewarding. - CSM Robert A.

Soldiers at the front read K - ration labels when the contents are listed on the package, just to be reading something. -SGT Bill Mauldin , Up Front , 1945, pp. 18, 25 From reading, we learn how men think, and that poor thinking has lost more battles than poor fighting. Reading also gives us a standard by whi ch to judge the future...reading can help us gain objectivity with which we must view certain issues and problems. -LTC Percy South , quoted by MSG Frank K. Nicolas , \"Noncommissioned Officer.\" Infantry , Jan 1958, p. 79 The drawbacks of learning only from our own experiences are that one person's experiences may be quite limited, and failures can often be extremely costly. Study, however, places at one's fingertips the collective experience of the ages. [By reading] we can learn about bearing, courage, competence, training, about strategy, tactics, and operations from the finest military minds of all time. -Patricia Rhodes , \"Back to the Future.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1991, p. 19 The Major came to the orderly room and broached the subject of a company library. He had learned the cost of \"Harper's Classical and Family Libraries\"; a pair of book cases, with hinges [and holding the library of books] of uniform size and binding. When open the title of each book could be read, and when closed no book could move or get out of place; the books were all the same length and breadth, and an excellent collection. The Major led off with a subscription of $25.00. I followed with the same, [SGT Langfor d] Peel the same, then followed a calculation of what percentage would be due from each man in proportion to his pay to make up enough to pay for the whole. I took the list with each man's name. The Major spoke to the troop on the subject at the retreat roll call, explaining to them the advantages of so much good reading matter, and before dismissing the troop I requested each man who wanted to subscribe to come to the orderly room and sign the list pledging himself to pay the amoun t opposite his Professional Development 58 name on pay day. Most of the men off duty and at liberty signed immediately and the others soon after, and the library was assured with scarcely an effort. The Major collected the money at the pay table, and the books in their cases came on the first steamboat in February. Of course the library was sure to give me some trouble, but it was so popular and had such a good effect that with Bugler Brydon 's help I got used to it and ceased to look upon it as a burden. -1SG Per cival G. Lowe , Five Years a Dragoon [1849- 1854], pp. 124- 125 Career Goals Don't just shoot for the standard. Use the standard as a springboard to even greater achievements. -SMA Richard A. Kidd , in \"Facing the Future.\" Soldiers , Jul 1993, p. 7 It's important that soldiers set their sights early, but not too high. They should stair -step their goals and aim for them early. I can't stress that enough. You must set your goals and do this early enough t o explore all the options of a military career. -CSM Harry E. Hicks , \"Hicks Speaks on ADA Concerns, Strengths.\" Air Defense Artillery , Sep - Oct 1987, p. 31 Soldiers and NCOs should have personal and professional goals. Leaders mu st sit down with their soldiers and ensure that a good self -development program is in use. Every soldier should strive for excellence and be totally trained to do his or her job at the respective skill level. Professional goals should be based upon abiliti es to obtain these goals. NCOs play an important role, because we have a personal and professional responsibility to guide and help soldiers obtain these goals. We have a sacred responsibility to do that as leaders. -CSM David P. Klehn , \"Vantage Point.\" Military Intelligence , Jul-Sep 1989, p. 3 Envision the top of the ladder - not midway. -CSM Charles E. Webster , \"Changes in the Quartermaster Corps.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1989, p. 52 Where do you see y ourself next year? What do you wish your duties to be? Answer the same questions for three years from now. Four, five, or six years from now. Is there a particular job, MOS, or skill you feel might be the key to your career potential? Assume you stay in th e Army: Do you see your future as a troop leader or a staff specialist? Which appeals to you more? Use the answers to these questions as a starting point. Examine your qualifications and desires to help establish some realistic goals for the next year and more. Talk it over with your leaders. Some possible goals are- skill development training, add a new skill, change of MOS, change of Career Management Field, qualify for promotion, transfer to another unit, leadership training (NCOES), work toward a commis sion or warrant. Now comes the important part of career development planning. You must identify what must be done to accomplish your goals. Discuss your goals with your leaders. List the actions that must occur, and estimate some dates (milestones) for co mpletion. [Once this is done] you have accomplished the three steps of Career Development Planning. You have determined where you stand right now, set some realistic short- term (and perhaps longer -term) goals, and decided the actions and timing that might make it all happen.... Go through this exercise at least once each year with your first line leader. Chart your progress, reevaluate your professional standing and goals, and revise or make new plans. Your plans must be as alive as you are. -Army National Guard Noncommissioned Officer Handbook , 1989, pp. B -15- B- 18 While an E8, an NCO must serve one or more tours as a first sergeant to gain battery -level experience in administration, logistics, and leadership. Those with potential for even higher -level se rvice should serve at least one year on battalion staffs as operations or intelligence NCOs. In these assignments, the NCO can closely observe the battalion commander, the command sergeant major, and the battalion staff in action. The result is a better Field Artilleryman who understands the operation of larger units and the role of artillery in support of maneuver. -LTC Daniel L. Breitenbach and the FA Enlisted Branch PD NCOs, \"The Commander and NCO Professional Developmen t.\" Field Artillery , Aug 1989, p. 8 Don't be a casual observer; actively plan your career. Don't become \"deadlined\" because you didn't follow the preventive maintenance checks and services required for your career. -CSM Ronnie W. Davis , \"It's Your Career, What Are You Going to Do About It?\" Armor , Nov-Dec 1994, p. 5 Plan at least two promotions ahead.... Find out what it takes to be selected for promotion two grades ahead, and strive to meet those requirements before reaching that promotion window.... Try to attend and complete a military school, a correspondence course, or college classes each year. -MSG Wayne Kelley , \"Getting Your Stripes.\" Soldiers , Aug 1995, p. 27 Each of us as a noncommissioned off icer can expect to be selected as a recruiter, drill sergeant, ROTC instructor, or other special assignment during our career. Generally, the selection for a special assignment indicates that the sergeant is a top quality NCO , one who will perform well ove r a three- year period without supervision or a major loss of knowledge in his job skills.... Don't fight it! ... Special assignments outside of Professional Development 59 our MOS can be very rewarding and positive for our career. -CSM John M. Stephens , \"Fighting the System.\" Armor , Jan-Feb 1985, p. 7 A successful career as a noncommissioned officer is like a three legged stool. Each leg has its purpose. Remove one leg and you will fall flat. Your career legs are organizational assignments, institutional training, and self-development. The Army handles your organizational assignments and institutional training.... Self-development is a different matter.... Self - development programs are multi -faceted. If missions do not allow soldiers to participate in one a rea of self - development, they can concentrate on another until the situation changes.... With self -development, each soldier is the master of his destiny. -SGM James H. Clifford , \"A Successful Career.\" AUSA files, 1996, no pag e number Promotion A question frequently asked is, \"What can I do to improve my chances of promotion?\" The reply is really quite simple.... A soldier must seek the responsible jobs and see to it that his job performance will earn him the desired efficiency report; and he must strive to improve his score on his MOS evaluation test. -SMA George W. Dunaway , \"New Emphasis Aims at Putting More Strength in 'Backbone of the Army.'\" ARMY , Oct 1969, p. 35 Progress is morale -raising to all men. Knowing that advancement is possible and that excellent performance and preparation lead to promotion helps morale. -DA Pam 350- 12, Guide for Squad Leaders , 1967, p. 35 The first soldier to get promoted is usually the one who does the hard jo bs well.... The most satisfying jobs are the hardest and the hardest are leadership positions. - SGM Buddy W. Maxwell , \"The Road to E9.\" Ordnance , Summer 1984, pp. 24, 25 Promotions are based on the whole person concept. A soldier's ability to compete for promotion was never in the past, isn't today, nor will it ever be based [solely] on a written report. Certainly, the evaluation report plays a critical role, but there are many other areas considered by the promotion board members. SQT scores, appearance of the soldier - based on the DA photo- experience, variety of assignments, difficult leader assignments, the disciplinary record, awards and decorations, physical fitness, NCOES attendance, academic reports, are all areas other than the evaluation report the promotion board considers to determine promotion eligibility. -SMA Julius W. Gates , \"NCOs: Maintain the Momentum.\" Field Artillery , Dec 1987, p. 47 What do NCOs have to do to come out on top? Reme mber this acronym: PROMOTE. It stands for performance (and potential), recruiter (and other \"hard\" jobs), your OMPF (Official Military Personnel File), memorandum (that can be used to correspond with boards), your official photo, training, and education. - SGM Lena Williams , \"PROMOTE: Seven Letters Are an Easy Guide to Centralized Boards.\" NCO Journal , Spring 1992, p. 14 Soldiers who have performed their fair share of the tough overseas duty tend to have better career patterns, more varied assignments, more leadership experience, and higher selection rates. -COL Ron Dabbieri , Chief, Combat Support Career Division, \"Misplaced Compassion.\" Engineer , Jul 1990, p. 48 The tougher the job, the better the oppor tunity to show potential. But the [promotion board I served on] focused on performance rather than jobs. We first acknowledged that soldiers and NCOs have very little to do with what jobs they're assigned, but they have everything to do with how well they perform in those jobs. It's important to try to seek the hard jobs: section chief, platoon sergeant, first sergeant - those are tough jobs. But the board also saw drill sergeant, recruiter, and instructor as tough jobs. But that's only one piece of the pie. -CSM James C. McKinney , \"Advice to NCOs Today - Be Patient and Professional.\" Field Artillery , Oct 1993, p. 8 Let no man that is a Souldier, seeke to come to preferment in any office in the Field, except hee know himselfe fit to discharge the same. -The Military Garden...Instructions for All Young Souldiers , 1629, p. 3 Promotion and Perseverance Some really fine soldiers were not promoted because others were better qualified. The differences between the NCOs who were selected and those who were not are frequently very small. -SMA William G. Bainbridge , \"How Fair Is the Centralized Enlisted Promotion System?\" in DA Pam 360 -838, Commanders Call , Mar -Apr 1978, p. 5 An NCO doesn't stop doing h is duty because he's upset over not being promoted. There are many good NCOs in the Army who can't get promoted for various reasons, but they continue to do their job in a professional manner. [One NCO] believes he is justified in giving up and developing a negative attitude because he didn't receive what he believed to be proper recognition. However, he not only quit on himself but also quit on his soldiers.... Many truly good NCOs...do their job for no other reason than it's what they want to do. -MSG Samuel McGregor , \"Reply to 'Ranger Rick.' \" NCO Journal , Spring 1993, p. 22 Professional Development 60 Often when people realize they aren't going any further in the military you see their true character come out. - LTC Dean E. Mattson (former NCO), in Command, Leadership, and Effective Staff Support , 1996, p. 150 Preparing for Promotion Boards Remember your file and your fiche. Your file will not take care of itself and the soldier who looks out for his file is doing himself and the Army a great service. If your file does not show your training and experience, then it may as well never have happened as far as the promotion board is concerned. -SGM Buddy W. Maxwell , \"The Road to E9.\" Ordnance , Summer 19 84, p. 25 Your photo is your only visual representation before a board. -CSM John M. Stephens , \"Your Records Speak for You.\" Armor , May -Jun 1986, p. 50 Take care of your Department of the Army records. Keep them updated with all of the positive information you can. The contents of your records decide if and when you get promoted. -CSM David P. Taylor , \"Education: One Key to NCO Development.\" Field Artillery , Dec 1988, p. 41 To be selected for promotion, you must demonstrate continued outstanding performance and potential for increased responsibility. The bottom line is your record must speak for you - it will speak to the board . -\"How to Get Promoted.\" Field Artillery , Aug 1989, p. 9 About 10 perce nt of all [promotion] packets are missing something.... NCOs need to think back to when they were going up in front of an E -5 board. For that board they did everything just right - fresh haircut, spit -shine, and the uniform looked perfect. The same principl e applies when putting together their promotion packets. They need to do everything with care and a whole lot of pride. By doing this they will have a better chance of seeing more stripes. -SFC William Broderson , in \"Promotion Packets.\" EurArmy , Jan 1991, p. 29 NCOs should go about preparing their records [for promotion boards] with the same attention to detail they would give if appearing in person.... An NCO's record is a reflection of the total soldier. What a board member sees in a file is what they vote on. For that reason, NCOs must personally ensure their file is current and accurate before the board reviews it. -SGM Robert A. Wagner , \"Focus on Centralized Promotion Boards.\" NCO Journal , Wint er 1994, p. 13 [For promotion boards] you must look good, be proficient in your job skills, know Army customs and courtesies, keep your records up to date, tend to your health, and make sure your confidence in your abilities shines through in all you do. -CSM Collin L. Younger , USAR CSM, Evaluation News , Feb -Mar 1995, p. 6 NCOPD/NCODP (NCO Professional Development/ NCO Development Program) The development of noncommissioned officers. ..is the cumulative result of their military schooling, operational assignments, and self -development. -DA Pam 600 -32, Leader Development for the Total Army , 1991, p. 32 NCODP is a leadership tool. -AR 350- 17, Noncommissioned Officer Development Program, 1985, p. 3 The goal of the NCODP is to increase and sustain NCO combat readiness at the highest possible level.... NCOPD is (1) Sequential and progressive. (2) Battle focused. (3) In accordance with existing and emerging doctrine.... NCOPD consists of t raining programs, formal and informal, one -on-one or groups, involving coaching as well as instruction, and will be fully integrated into the daily routine of the unit. -AR 350- 17, Noncommissioned Officer Development Program, 1991, p. 3 Professional development [is] a means to an end, not an end in itself. -\"Group Studies NCOs.\" Soldiers , Apr 1986, p. 24 The NCOES system is primarily an educational system, but it's only an element of the total system we need to develop NCOs. NCOs develop in the motor pool, in the barracks, in the field and going down the tank ranges. Units have to provide opportunities to develop their NCOs in each of these places. Opportunities for \"old\" sergeants and \"new\" sergeants to learn their jobs, to learn their strengths and wea knesses, and to develop their capabilities to their full potential must be provided in the unit. And I don't only mean NCO classes where you talk about police call or what you're going to do next week on the volksmarch or out in the field. Units have to ha ve a program which identifies shortcomings in their NCOs and provides them ways to overcome those shortcomings. We're not preparing our NCOs in the best way if we just send them off to school without also having unit development programs. And units will ha ve to have regular programs. There will have to be an evaluation by the command sergeant major and strong direction by the commander, the sergeant major, and all senior NCOs. -GEN Edward C. Meyer , \"From the Top.\" Soldiers , Jan 1 981, p. 30 [1SG Michael Teal 's first steps in developing an NCODP program for a National Guard unit were]: interview personally each NCO from E5 to E7; estimate their strengths, weaknesses, and knowledge; record for Professional Development 61 future reference; identify individuals, not necessarily NCOs, who had skills or special knowledge to help teach the classes. -CPT Thomas R. Siler , \"NCO Development Program.\" Army Trainer , Summer 1983, p. 15 As a first sergeant, I ran across [ an NCODP] self - assessment program. It has proven to be a valuable tool in determining subject areas the NCOs want for NCODP. Each NCO or potential NCO receives a copy of the self -assessment; he completes and returns it to the unit first sergeant. [The NCOP D Self -Assessment has the subjects on the left, and across the top are the categories for the NCOs to rate such as: \"I know all I need about this.\" \"I could refresher training.\" \"I need some instruction in this.\" \"I need a lot of instruction.\"] The fir st sergeant then consolidates all the self-assessments. This gives him an idea of subject areas the unit NCOs want emphasized during NCODP. -CSM William J. Stoltz , \"NCO Professional Development Self - Assessment.\" Army Trainer , Fall 1984, p. 25 The noncommissioned officers' education system (NCOES) does not produce noncommissioned officers. It will not nor was it ever intended to do so. The NCOES builds upon the training conducted by the unit to further the development of that n oncommissioned officer. Leaders are made, not born. -SMA Glen E. Morrell , \"NCOs Are the 'Vital Link in the Chain of Command.' \" ARMY , Oct 1985, p. 64 [Our unit's Soldier Profile Worksheet includes important questions] such as: W hy is this soldier in my unit?

Estepa Soldiers Also Deserve Mentoring.\" NCO Journal , Fall 19 94, p. 19 If it is possible, the soldier's immediate supervisor and other NCOs and officers in the unit's chain of command should visit him while he is attending school. If they can't, they should at least try to keep in touch by mail or telephone. Some m embers of the chain of command should attend the soldier's graduation and if he does an outstanding job at the school, a letter from the commander should be presented to him at a company formation. -CSM William J. Cronin , \"The First Sergeant.\" 40 [Comments on NCODP]: -Those units that truly have well -thought -out programs are definitely strengthening the NCO leadership in their units. (Division CDR). [The] formalized program emphasized in AR 350 -17 is just one small portion of an effective NCODP. NCODP is an every day - all day program built on mentoring and coaching at every level. (Division CSM). -NCOES is just one part of NCOPD. We must develop NCOs just like we develop discipline, day by day, little by little. (Division CSM). -NCOPD should flow with the mission and problems of the unit. Tailor the instruction around the unit's annual training schedule...concentrate on real world problems! (Post/School Study , 32, 35 NCOES (Noncommissioned Officer Education System) [In NCOES] we work on a soldier's potential, better equip him to understand himself, his abilities, and his role on the Army team. The NCOES provides a means of ensuring the quality NCO's cont inued contribution to a constantly modernizing Army. These training systems are more than merely some more schools; they are true educational institutions. The entire system available to the enlisted force continues to improve and is the prime catalyst in producing a more professional force. This training, because the soldier can see a career pattern develop, is another reason why he becomes motivated. - SMA William G. Bainbridge , \"Quality, Training and Motivation.\" ARMY , Oct 1976, p. 28 The purpose of schools is to equip noncommissioned officers with the necessary knowledge and skill to lead and instruct their units in an effective manner.

Yes, it is part of our promotion system but is no guarantee of promotion by itself. We earn promotions through working hard, serving in demanding leadership positions, taking care of our soldiers, maintaining technical and tactical competence, and earning NCO enlisted ratings that set us apart from our peers. NCOs should not look at any school as a certification for promotion but rather a gateway to growth. -CSM Randolph S. Hollingsworth, \"Vantage Point.\" Military Intelligence , Jul-Sep 1995, p. 4 Professional Development 62 The Development of NCOES - The Discussion of the Need for Standardized NCO Education and Training If in future wars we would increase the chances of victory, and diminish the waste of human life, we should devote our attention to the education of our non - commissioned no less than the commissioned office rs of our army. [All European armies have accepted the theory] that a good non -commissioned officer can no more be improvised than an officer. [The following description of sergeants applies] with very few modifications to all of the armies on the Continen t.... The Italian Government manifests its care in forming an efficient body of non -commissioned officers [through a] system of schools provided for their special education and training...and still further [increases] their efficiency by a long system of practical training. -MG Emory Upton, The Armies of Asia and Europe , 1878, pp. 123- 126 Non-commissioned officers, properly to perform the duties of their position, require, and should receive, a special education. -Report of the Sec retary of War , 1888, p. 142 We cannot recognize too clearly that modern warfare makes enlarged demands upon the abilities of non - commissioned officers, and their character, instruction, and familiarity with responsibility is of very special importance to us. -Report of the Secretary of War , 1889, p. 131 The object should be to teach non -commissioned officers in such a manner that when they are pronounced proficient, they actually do know these things and can impart them to others. It is not to give the c aptain and lieutenants an easy time - so that the captain can say, \"Sergeant, drill so and so,\" and then go home and sleep. It is for the purpose of strengthening the efficiency of the troop, giving the officer more time to devote to instructing his non- commissioned officers and men in the higher duties of the art of war. -1LT C.

Bratton , \"Noncommissioned Officers' Training School.\" Infantry , Apr 1922, p. 426 When I first started out as an infantryman I would have been very fortu nate to have attended some type of school. I was among those fumbling corporals and buck sergeants who were spending 16 to 18 hours a day attempting to do a good job that should have taken only ten to 12 hours. For a while, we must have looked like the blind leading the blind, burning the midnight oil, rehearsing classes, with no one to teach us proper teaching methods, and not knowing whether we were carrying on correctly. I don't doubt that had I been made more proficient through proper training, many of the soldiers I taught would have fared better in combat during the first months of the Korean War. I can admit now that I carried on in the best way I knew how - as many other young noncoms did - but that best was not good enough. -SGM Morris J. Terrebonne , \"Needed: A Corps of NCO Instructors.\" ARMY , Nov 1967, p. 61 The Development of NCOES - The Establishment of the NCO Academies The United States Constabulary opened a Noncommissioned Officers Academy - the Army's only schoo l of its type - on October 17, 1949, in Munich, Germany.... It has been an answer to developing the NCO as a leader - the role which must be his in our modern Army. And it is a challenge in sharpening his know -how, expanding his background, and lifting his prestige. The NCO Academy at Munich, heralded as the most advanced effort by any postwar Army unit to custom -train its noncommissioned officers for today's command responsibility, is the outgrowth of the belief of Major General I. D. White, Constabulary Commander, that an Army's chain of command is no stronger than its critical link - the noncommissioned officer. -BG Bruce C. Clarke , \"U.S. Constabulary Builds an NCO Academy.\" Armored Cavalry , May -Jun 1950, p. 36 The NCO academies were the polishing stones for NCOs. -SMA Leon L. Van Autreve , \"As I See It.\" Soldiers , Jul 1975, p. 9 [GEN Bruce Clarke was] the Johnny Appleseed of NCO academies. [The success of the Army's NCO Academies] brought imitation. In the Air Force GEN Curtis E. LeMay sought to establish a similar system of academies within the Strategic Air Command (SAC). He sent observers to Munich to see how the Army academies were organized, and copied portions of the Army's system as he set up academies within his command. Soon academies could be found throughout the Air Force. They continue in operation to this day. - Dr. Robert H. Bouilly , \"Twenty -Five Years of NCOES 1970- 1995.\" 1995, 2, 3 Professional Development 63 The Implementation of NCOES In 1966, Chief of Staff GEN Harold K. Johnson convened the first major command command sergeants major conference at t he Pentagon.... The number one recommendation was establishment of an NCOES. - SMA William O. Wooldridge , in \"But You're a Combat Veteran.\" NCO Journal , Fall 1992, p. 15 Implemented in 1971, NCOES began as a three- level (later four - and now five -level) education system for enlisted careerists. The program had four specific objectives: to increase the professional quality of the NCO corps; to provide enlisted personnel with opportunities for progressive, continuing professional development; to enhance career attractiveness; and to provide the Army with trained and dedicated NCOs. - The Story of the Noncommissioned Officer Corps , 1989, p. 27 The Sergeants Major Academy The Sergeants Major Academy [is the] keeper of the flame for its NCO corps. [Its] guiding principles [are]: we serve as the conscience and voice of the NCO corps and project its ideals worldwide; where there is an Army standard, we set the example; we exemplify the Army ethic and Army values; our focus is serv ing the Army in the field; total quality is the source of our pride and reputation; continuous improvement is essential to our success; our people are the source of our strength. -L. James Binder , \"Conscience, Voice of a Corps.\" ARM Y, Jul 1992, p. 30 We're the capstone of the NCO Education System, but we're also the bedrock and all points between. We're stepping stones. -CSM Larry J. Hampton , in \"The NCO Leader Ladder.\" Soldiers , Jan 1987, p. 6 There can be no question that [the Sergeants Major Academy] is one of the best things that ever happened to the NCO corps. -SMA George W. Dunaway , in The Sergeants Major of the Army , 1995, p. 65 The Effectiveness of NCOES We're sol d on NCOES.... Our people come out of those courses walking tall and eager to take on the world.... It's the only way to fly and we like the flight plan a little better each time we attend an NCOES graduation. - SMA Leon L. Van Autreve , \"Walking Tall - and Eager.\" Soldiers , Feb 1974, p. 31 [Comments on NCOES]: -NCOES is an excellent investment with high returns. Reduction of unit readiness is offset by long term gains. (MACOM CDR). -The most cost -effective program in the Army, bar none. (MACOM CDR). -The hidden benefit of having our leaders away is the development of our junior leaders. (Division CDR, ARNG). -The system is very responsive to the needs of the NCO Corps, and is continually changing to fit the needs of the Army. (Division CSM). -NCOES is money in the bank. (Division CSM). - NCOPD Study , Vol 2, 1986, pp. L -4-38, 39, 45, 50 Our Army has invested heavily into building a strong noncommissioned officer corps.... Our Army has made a wise investment. -SMA Juliu s W. Gates , \"From the SMA.\" NCO Call , May -Jun 1990, inside front cover I sincerely believe both the Army and the Officer Corps have been enhanced 1,000 -percent by NCOES. -SMA Leon L. Van Autreve , in \"NCOES Sets the Pace for Enlisted Leadership.\" NCO Journal , Fall 1992, p. 10 I cannot overstate the impact of...the Sergeants Major Academy and the NCOE System on leadership in our Army. The health of the Army is directly related to and influenced by t he health of the NCO Corps. NCO leadership has sustained the institution, made it grow and flourish. -GEN Gordon R. Sullivan, Collected Works , 1995, p. 109 Conclusion and The Future For nearly a century and a half after th e Revolutionary War there was no formal school system to pass along the collective wisdom of senior NCOs. -Time -Honored Professionals , 1989, no page number This year, the Sergeants Major Academy class includes the first soldiers to have completed NCOES f rom bottom to top: PLDC, BNCOC, ANCOC, and now the Academy. That's the wave of the future. -GEN Gordon R. Sullivan , \"The Chief's View of NCO Leadership Challenges.\" NCO Journal , Winter 1994, p. 7 As we...position the NCO Cor ps for the future, we must not lose sight of where we have been or where we need to go. Our azimuth is clear. -CSM G.
