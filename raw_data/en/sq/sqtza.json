Chloride in salt is naturally quite abrasive. So adding salt can lead to rapid degradation of vitamins used in our mixes if exposed to light, moisture and heat etc. The addition of salt could considerably reduce the shelf life of our products. Our products are packed and sealed in carefully controlled packing facilities at our mixing house. We cannot guarantee how products are stored once opened by our customers. We have a fast turnover of products and all our mixes benefit from long shelf lives. Customers can feel confident that their products will remain fresh and free from degradation. Our Balancers and Premixes are formulated with the specialist guidance of World-leading nutritionists at the Professional Mixing House Company we use. We recommend all horses should have free access to salt. However, a salt lick alone cannot be relied upon to cover maintenance & sweat requirements. Many horses do not choose to use the lick enough. The amount of salt needed is variable depending on how much the horse sweats. For example, a 500 kg Horse needs 10g of sodium per day (25g of salt) for maintenance needs, this is without exercise or sweating on hot days. 1 - 2 tablespoons of salt per day, added to the horse's feed is a reasonable amount to cover maintenance requirements. Working horses will require additional electrolytes. Dissolving the salt in water & spraying it onto hay, can be an alternative option for picky eaters. A premixture for horses.
