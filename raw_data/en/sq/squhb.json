More patients and parents are questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Your responses to them require knowledge, tact, and time. Healthcare providers can miss opportunities to vaccinate by believing false contraindications and following unnecessary rules. 1Vaccine hesitancy, reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated to have one's children vaccinated, is identified by the World Health Organization one of the top ten globaal health threats of 2019.Arguments against vaccination are contradicted by overwhelming scientific consensus about the safety and efficacy of vaccines . Hesitancy results from public debates around the medical, ethical and legal issues related to vaccines. It has existed since the invention of vaccination, and pre -dates the coining of the terms \"vaccine\" and \"vaccination\" by nearly 80 years. The specific hypotheses raised by anti -vaccination advocates have been found to change over time.[7]hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine -preventable diseases . Bills for mandatory vaccination have been considered for legislation, including California Senate Bill 277Australia'sNo Jab No Pay, all of which have been strenuously opposed by anti -vaccination activists.[14][15][16]to mandatory vaccination be based on anti -vaccine sentiment, or concern that it violates civil liberties reduces public trust in vaccination.Effective, empathetic communication is critical in responding to parents who are considering not vaccinating their children -Parents should be helped to feel comfortable voicing any concerns or questions they have about vaccination -Providers should be prepared to listen and respond effectivelyTalking about vaccines \"A successful discussion about vaccines involves a two-way conversation, with both parties sharing information and asking questions.\" Talking with Parents about Vaccines for Infants (CDC) www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/downloads/talk -infants -color -office.pdf Ask questions Evaluate whether the child has a valid contraindication to a vaccine by asking about medical history, allergies, and previous experiences Assess the parent's reasons for wanting to delay or forgo vaccination in a non -confrontational manner -Have they had a bad experience? -Obtained troubling information? -Do they have a religious or personal belief that they think conflicts with vaccination? Dialogue If parents have safety concerns or misconceptions about vaccination, ask them to identify the source(s) of those concerns or beliefs Listen carefully, paraphrase to the parent what they have told you, and ask them if you have correctly interpreted what they have said Provide factual information in understandable language that addresses the specific concerns or misconceptions the parent has about vaccination Tetanus: This baby has neonatal tetanus. His body is rigid. Infection can occur when the newly cut umbilical cord is exposed to dirt, as can occur in a developing country. Most newborns who get tetanus die. Neonatal tetanus can be prevented by hygienic delivery practices, and/or by immunizing mothers against tetanus.

Approximately 79 million American are infected with HPV. Most sexually -active men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives. Photo courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Persistent infection with high-risk types of HPV is associated with almost all cervical cancers. An estimated 29,600 HPV -associated cancers occur annually in the U.S.Cervical cancerPertussis: This child has pertussis (whooping cough). He has severe coughing spasms, which are often followed by a \"whooping\" sound. It is difficult for him to stop coughing and catch his breath. Babies are the most likely to die from pertussis and can have complications such as seizures and brain damage.

Measles can cause pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and even death. Death from measles occurs in 2 to 3 per 1,000 reported cases in the U.S. Photo courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)MYTH : MMR causes autism Many large, well -designed studies have found no link between MMR and autism. Autism usually becomes apparent around the same time MMR is given -no evidence of causality. Autism probably has multiple components, including genetics (e.g., one study found that if one identical twin had autism, the chance that the second twin had autism was greater than 90%, but with fraternal twins the chance was less than 10%.) 13MYTH : MMR causes autism (cont.) The 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield that started this concern was based on 12 children who were preselected for study. In 2004, 10 of the 13 authors of this study retracted the study's interpretation. 14MYTH : MMR causes autism (cont.) On 2/2/2010, the editors of The Lancet retracted the paper following the ruling of the U.K.'s General Medical Council that stated the primary author's conduct regarding his research was \"dishonest\" and \"irresponsible\" and that he had shown a \"callous disregard\" for the suffering of children involved in his studies. Wakefield was subsequently removed from the U.K medical register and is no longer licensed to practice medicine. InJanuary 2011, the BMJ published aseries ofarticles showing butdeliberate fraud. 15References IAC's \"MMR vaccine cause autism.

As babies pass through the birth canal and breathe, they are immediately colonized with trillions of bacteria, which means that they carry the bacteria in their bodies but aren't infected by them. Healthy babies constantly make antibodies against these bacteria and viruses. 22MYTH : Giving an infant multiple vaccines can overwhelm the immune system (cont ) Vaccines use only a tiny proportion of a baby's immune system's ability to respond; though children receive more vaccines than in the past, today's vaccines contain fewer antigens (e.g., sugars and proteins) than previous vaccines. Smallpox vaccine alone contained 200 proteins; the 14 currently recommended routine vaccines contain fewer than 150 immunologic components. 23References VEC's \"Too many the Immune System www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccines/multiplevaccines.html \"Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses\" by Paul Offit, MD and Jeffery Gerber, MD http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full 24MYTH : It's better to space out vaccines using an alternative schedule Delaying vaccines increases the time children will be susceptible to diseases In 2014, there were 665 cases of measles reported in the U.S. The majority of people who got measles were unvaccinated. Measles is still common in many parts of the world, including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa, and can easily be transported. In 2014, 32,971 cases of pertussis were reported to CDC, and many more cases were undiagnosed. Requiring many extra appointments for vaccination increases the stress for the child and may lead to a fear of visits to the clinic. There is no evidence that spreading out the schedule decreases the risk of adverse reactions. 25References \"The Problem With Dr. Bob's Alternative Vaccine Schedule\" MD http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/123/1/e164. full.pdf Dysfunction\" www.nap.edu/read/10306/chapter/1 \"Parental Refusal of Pertussis Vaccination is Associated with an Increased Risk of Pertussis Infection in Children\" Gianz et al http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/123/6/1445.abstract 26MYTH : Natural infection is better than immunization Natural infection usually does not cause better immunity than vaccination. However, the price paid for natural disease can include: paralysis permanent brain damage liver failure liver cancer deafness blindness loss of limbs death 27References \"Natural Infection vaccine -preventable diseases www.immunize.org/photos Real -life accounts of people who have suffered or died from vaccine - preventable diseases www.immunize.org/reports 28MYTH : Thimerosal causes autism The form of mercury found in thimerosal is ethylmercury (EM), not methylmercury (MM). MM is the form that has been shown to damage the nervous system. Although no evidence of harm has ever been demonstrated, thimerosal was taken out of vaccines as a precaution, and \"because it can be\" (due to single dose vials). Since 2001, with the exception of a few influenza vaccine products, thimerosal has not been used as a preservative in any routinely recommended childhood vaccines. 29MYTH : Thimerosal causes autism (cont ) Multiple studies have shown that thimerosal in vaccines does not cause autism when comparing children who received thimerosal -containing vaccines and those who received vaccines not containing thimerosal. Studies of three countries compared the incidence of autism before and after thimerosal was removed from vaccines (in 1992 in Europe and 2001 in the U.S.). There was no decrease in autism with the switch to thimerosal -free vaccines. 30References CDC's Vaccine Safety Concerns web page www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns IAC's collection of thimerosal- related resources www.immunize.org/thimerosal Institute on thimersal www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/cdcstudiesonvaccinesandautism.pdf \"Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses\" by Paul Offit, MD and Jeffery Gerber, MD http://cid/oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full 32MYTH : Ingredients in vaccines are harmful Aluminum Aluminum is used in some vaccines as an adjuvant -an ingredient that improve the immune response. Adjuvants can allow for use of less antigen. They have been used for this purpose for more than 70 years. Aluminum is the most common metal found in nature. It is in the air and in food and drink. Infants get more aluminum through breast milk or formula than vaccines. Most of the aluminum taken into the body is quickly eliminated. 33MYTH : Ingredients in vaccines are harmful (cont.) Formaldehyde Formaldehyde is used to detoxify diphtheria and tetanus toxins or to inactivate a virus. The tiny amount which may be left over from these steps in making vaccines is safe. Formaldehyde is also found in products like paper towels, mascara, and carpeting. Humans normally have formaldehyde in their blood streams at levels higher than is found in vaccines. 34MYTH : Ingredients in vaccines are harmful (cont.) Miscellaneous Antibiotics are present in some vaccines to prevent bacterial contamination when the vaccine is made. Additives such as gelatin, albumin, sucrose, lactose, MSG, and glycine help the vaccine stay effective while being stored. Trying to make vaccines without adjuvants, additives, and preservatives is difficult -these ingredients keep vaccine safe and effective. 35References VEC's \"Aluminum in Vaccines: gen/whatifstop.htm IAC's \"Personal belief exemptions for vaccination put people at risk. Examine the evidence for yourself.\" www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2069.pdf 41MYTH : Abortions are required to produce vaccines It's true that production of varicella, rubella, rabies, and hepatitis A vaccines involves growing viruses in human cell culture. Two human cell lines provide these cultures; they were developed from two legally aborted fetuses in the 1960s. The donor fetuses were not aborted for the purpose of obtaining these cells. The same cell lines have been used for more than 40 years - no new fetal tissue is required. 42References IAC's web page about ethical and religious objections to vaccination www.immunize.org/concerns/religious.asp Why Were Fetal Cells Used to Make Certain : VAERS data prove that vaccines are dangerous VAERS data cannot \"prove\" anything. Anyone can report anything...not proof of causality is required. Only reports of special interest (e.g., hospitalizations) are verified. When checked, many reports are not accurate. Reports include many non-serious reactions. The number of reported adverse events is influenced by publicity. VAERS is properly used to detect early warning signals and generate hypotheses. 44References Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting Systems (VAERS) www.vaers.hhs.gov CDC's Vaccine Safety Monitoring web page www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccine_Monitoring/Index.html CDC's \"Ensuring the Safety of -vaers following immunization\" www.who.int/vaccine_safety/causality/en 45Don't drug companies make big profits from pushing vaccines? Vaccines are not high -profit products. Vaccine sales are dwarfed by prescription sales. Costs for research, development, and compliance with standards are high, with no guarantee that a vaccine will be licensed. If vaccines were highly profitable, why would only a few companies produce almost all of the U.S. childhood vaccines today, when there used to be 25 companies producing vaccines? Vaccine manufacturing is a public service.Isn't it my right not to vaccinate my child? Vaccination laws have been found to be constitutional in U.S. courts. Seminal case was Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905. All states offer medical exemptions. Parents need to be aware that if they don't vaccinate their children, they are putting them, and their contacts, at risk of serious disease. Unvaccinated children often have to stay home from school or daycare during outbreaks.References The Vaccine Enterprise (Health Affairs , May 2005, Supplement) http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/3.toc Big Pharma Vaccine ProfitsThe Real Conspiracy (The investment: a modelled comparison of economic incentives www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3846654Good resources FOR PROVIDERS talking to parents and patients IAC's Talking about Vaccines web section www.immunize.org/talking -about- vaccines IAC's to Parents web section www.immunize.org/talking -about- vaccines/responding -to-parents.asp CDC's Provider Resources for Vaccine Conversations with Parents web section www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations Vaccine Education Center www.chop.edu/centers -programs/vaccine -education- center AAP's immunization website www.aap.org/immunization National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit www.izsummitpartners.org 49Good resources FOR PARENTS IAC's handouts for communicating with parents www.immunize.org/handouts/discussing -vaccines -parents.asp IAC's website for the public www.vaccineinformation.org CDC's fact sheets on vaccine -preventable diseases for parents diseases/index.html CDC's Childhood Immunization\" www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/parents www.ecbt.org and www.vaccinateyourfamily.org 50Don't worry about every possible question Be able to recommend good websites and handouts for patients/parents.
