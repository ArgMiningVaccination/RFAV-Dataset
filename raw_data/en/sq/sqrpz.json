Currently, there is also a worldwide interest in the integration of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional medicine into integrative medicine. This article explores the contribution of anthroposophic medicine (AM) to the promotion of self-management of patients. Material and methods: The scientific literature on concepts of, evidence on and experiences of patients with AM was explored. Results: The AM approach contributes to: (1) a patient-centered, collaborative promotion of patient self-management by means of application of basic values (equivalence, servitude, and presence of mind) and specific methods; (2) a better coping with health-related issues by providing a spiritual worldview that serves as a coping strategy; by treating patients in such a way that they (further) develop self-regulating functioning, both on the physiological and the psychosocial level, thus enabling the self-management of disease-related symptoms; and by treating with (non-verbal) therapies that improve emotion-focused coping skills; and (3) a better self-monitoring of: one's own activity during treatment and in dealing with treatment- and health-related issues, and the physiological and/or psychological responses to these (self-reflection) activities. Conclusion: AM provides specific contributions to promoting self-management of patients.
