Isabelle passed away peacefully on July 2nd, 2023. I'm now dedicating this interview as a loving tribute to her loving kindness and beautiful brilliance. In 2011, Isabelle received a minor surgical intervention under general anesthetic, from which she was meant to recover rapidly as she was in good health. However, she lost the ability to walk for several months and couldn't find any solutions through conventional medicine. Desperate to find a way out, she opened up to energy healing despite her initial skepticism. The healing sessions helped her recover fully! This inspired her so much that she decided to train intensively in energy medicine and devote herself to healing work. More about Isabelle Goutines Isabelle graduated with distinction on a two-year intensive accredited spiritual healing course taught by Sue Allen from the [School of Intuition and Healing in London](https://www.intuitionandhealing.co.uk/). She also continued training in several modalities and worked as a certified Hypnotherapist and Transformational Regression Therapist. We had a lovely long chat via a Zoom meeting in early August. It was a sunny afternoon for her in London while past my kids' bedtime in Singapore. I am so amazed by how she described this turning point in her life, dove deep into the world of spiritual healing, and continues to facilitate profound healing for her clients and loved ones. Isabelle has some fascinating aspects in her chart that we have included in our discussion too. "}
