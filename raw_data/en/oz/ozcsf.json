It is also a promising neuroprotectant and may be helpful in treating ADHD Hypericum perforatum aka St John's wort, is a flowering plant Constituents (Hyperforin) function as SSRI St. John's wort can help with mild to moderate depression Although many people use St. John's wort as long-term treatment, there is little evidence of long-term safety or efficacy St. John's wort has serious potential interactions with many prescription medications, including antidepressants, birth control medications and others Ginkgo biloba is an ancient Chinese herbal remedy that has been shown to have significant neuroprotective effects Although it has a mild effect in protecting against dementia, it probably does not prevent it Investigated As adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), for protection against the neural damage caused by antipsychotics, and for the treatment of depression Has an excellent safety record; and except for the assumed possible risk of hemorrhage in patients taking anticoagulants, having bleeding disorders, or [about to] undergo surgery EXERCISE The positive effects of exercise on immune system functions are well documented Has been shown to ameliorate depression, anxiety, and PTSD Improve cognitive function and self-esteem Reduce psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic populations Promotes secretion of neurotransmitters- serotonin, adrenaline, and endogenous opiates Studies have also associated weight loss with increased social interaction, distraction from stress, recreational enjoyment, and mastery of challenge Developed in Germany by Samuel Hahnemann at the end of the 18th century Unconventional theories: - \"Like cures like\"- disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people -\"Law of minimum dose\"- lower dose of medication, has greater effectiveness- Dilute solutions such as 1:1,020,000 Remedies are derived from plants, minerals, or animals, such as red onion, silver, gold, crushed whole bees, snake venom Formulated as sugar pellets or tinctures( mixed with 95% grain alcohol) Widely used to self-treat generalized anxiety and other anxiety symptoms Case reports of homeopathic remedies in PTSD, social phobia, panic disorder, and OCD were published.

Studies- Reduces anxiety, depression and insomnia Widely used outside of mainstream medicine, to relieve pain, especially postoperative pain and to facilitate patient recovery This ancient Chinese technique - to increase the life force in the body through a series of slow circular movements Moving form of meditation based on the search for perfect balance between yin and yang energies The practitioner is expected to focus on breathing and its precise synchronization with the movements Used to treat anxiety, depression, muscular tension, high blood pressure, and other cardiovascular conditions Yoga is a Sanskrit word, meaning \"to join\" Physical postures(Asanas), controlled breathing (Pranayama) and meditation(Dhyana) Technique of yoga seeks to bring balance all the aspects of body, mind, and personality Positive benefits - Depression, ADHD, Anxiety, Insomnia and PTSD Why people use Complementary and Alternative therapies? Three theories have been proposed to explain the use of CAM 1.Dissatisfaction: - Dissatisfied with conventional treatment because it has been ineffective, has produced adverse effects, or too costly 2.Need for personal contact: - They see them less authoritarian, more empowering, offering them offer personal autonomy over their health care decisions 3.Philosophical congruence: - More attractable because they are seen as more compatible with patients' values, spiritual/religious philosophy, or beliefs INTEGRATIVE PSYCHIATRY A new type of psychiatry selectively incorporates elements of complementary and alternative medicine into practice methods Emphasizes treatment rather than diagnosis and views the patient holistically, taking into account not only mind-body issues and interactions but spiritual values as well Prevention of illness emphasized by having the patient pay attention to lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise Stress reduction involves use of yoga, meditation, or other relaxation exercises Any of the complementary methods described can be integrated into standard psychotherapeutic practice Ideally, the psychiatrist practicing integrative therapy should be schooled in one or more of the complementary methods used Integrative psychiatrists may use psychoactive herbs in conjunction with traditional psychopharmacologic agents, mindful of the possibility of adverse drug-drug interactions A complementary practitioner may work in conjunction with the psychiatrist Take Home Message... Whenever required using an alternative therapy may be helpful Usage of alternative therapies based on patients religious background To discourage the use of non evidence based therapies \"He's the best physician that knows the worthlessness of the most medicines\" - Benjamin Franklin References Synopsis of Psychiatry- 11th edition Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 10th edition Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Psychiatry BY Philip R.
